[1] China (Hubei), 2nd fatality

Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee's report on pneumonia of new coronavirus infection 16 Jan 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At 04:00 on [15 Jan 2020], there were no new cases of pneumonitis infected with new coronavirus in our city. A total of 5 patients were discharged from the hospital and 1 new death was reported. The deceased, a male, 69 years old, became ill on [31 Dec 2019], became worse on [4 Jan 2020] and was transferred to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital for treatment. He was admitted with severe myocarditis (myocardial enzymes reached 20 times normal, electrocardiographic abnormalities); abnormal renal function; severe damage to multiple organ functions; chest CT showed pulmonary fibrous lesions and pleural effusion and pleural thickening. Considering tuberculosis and pleural tuberculosis, the patient died at 00:45 on [15 Jan 2020] after unsuccessful CPR [cardiopulmonary resuscitation] efforts .

As of now [Thu 16 Jan 2020], the city has reported a total of 41 cases of pneumonia caused by this new coronavirus infection; 12 cases have been cured and discharged, 5 cases are being treated in severe cases, and 2 cases have died. The remaining patients are in stable condition. All patients received isolation treatment at designated medical institutions in Wuhan. A total of 763 close contacts have been tracked, 644 medical observations have been lifted, and 119 medical observations are still underway. Among the close contacts, no related cases were found.

[From the description of the 2nd fatality clinical picture, it is suggestive that the individual may have had pre-existing co-morbidities (note the speculated tuberculosis and pleural tuberculosis), albeit the admission findings of a myocarditis and multiorgan failure could also be the result of an overwhelming viral infection. Interestingly there have been no newly identified cases in Wuhan City, even though the 2 cases that were confirmed outside of China (in Thailand and in Japan) both did not give a history of contact with the implicated Huanan Wholesale Seafood market while in Wuhan City, and one speculated possible contact with possible other cases in Wuhan.

[2] Japan ex China, antipyretic use pre-screening

According to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, a Chinese man who was confirmed to be infected with a new type of viral pneumonia had a fever from the 3rd, but when returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, he took antipyretic drugs and went through quarantine.

From press conference of the Ministry, heard by [ProMED-mail Rapp. KI] on the internet
1. Enhanced quarantine, like posters for returned travelers, were imposed on [7 Jan 2020].
2. He passed through the Airport on [6 Jan 2020].
3. Maximum he had temperature of 39 degrees (C) on [9 Jan 2020]
4. He had a high fever in Wuhan
5. Government did not disclose the following data: arrival airport, living place (somewhere in Kanagawa), hospital name and place, transportation methods used
6. Discovered by surveillance system, established in April 2019, for atypical (pneumonia) cases
a. high fever (hospitalization needed)
b. pneumonia
c. excluding other pathogens

7. Government asked him and his family to stay home and take health checks. (no legal binders since this is voluntary)

[Whether the use of antipyretics (drugs that lower fevers) was intentional (to avoid being flagged at airport arrival) or taken to feel better while travelling (without intent to avoid being flagged at airport arrival), the end result is the same - a febrile individual not captured through airport screening. A good example of one of the known weakness in relying on airport screening for fevers to identify potential cases of a disease under heightened surveillance. Fortunately Japan has a strong surveillance system and when this individual presented to the health sector for treatment of his febrile illness, appropriate measures were taken - which included a travel history, and physical exam (and presumably a chest X-ray) as well as blood work and samples for testing for the Wuhan nCoV (coronavirus). Presumably close contacts are being monitored and checked for possible infection as well.

That being said, the airport fever screening identified a case of the Wuhan nCoV infection. Again, the Thai surveillance system was activated and close contacts are under observation during the duration of the proposed incubation period (up to 14 days). - Mod.MPP]

[3] Hong Kong, pneumonia screening

As of 12 noon local time on [Thu 16 Jan 2020], there have been a total of 78 suspected cases with recent travel history to Wuhan, Hubei. To date, none of the cases have been tested as positive for the novel CoV associated with the outbreak in Wuhan.

[Of the 78 individuals under heightened surveillance, 22 (22.8%) did not have any virus identified. The most common viruses to be identified were influenza viruses 33 (42.3 percent) of which 2 were type B, 11 were type A (H1) and 20 were type A (H3). The next most common virus identified was the human rhinovirus/enterovirus - in 17 individuals (21.8%). Other viruses identified included parainfluenza viruses, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), human metapneumovirus, adenovirus and coronaviruses (CoV) 229E and OC43.

Interestingly, 16 individuals had multiple viruses isolated simultaneously including 3 individuals with 3 different viruses identified. But no individuals thus far have been identified to be infected with the novel CoV identified in the Wuhan outbreak. An interesting sampling of the respiratory viruses currently circulating in Wuhan City, Hubei China and Hong Kong as any one of these viruses could have been acquired in either location prior to the onset of their illnesses. - Mod.MPP]

With most infectious disease what we see is just the tip of the iceberg. Almost certainly there is wider spread beyond the cases that we actually detect. This is especially so when an infection has a spectrum of illness: we are more likely to detect the severe cases and miss those that are less severe.

The cases of nCoV detected in persons who did not visit the Wuhan animal market that was associated with the 1st cases support the hypothesis that Wuhan nCoV is already wider spread among the population and has a spectrum of illness and that many cases are not coming to the attention of the surveillance system.

What is needed to sort out the question of how much of the iceberg we are seeing is the development of a serologic test for antibodies to Wuhan nCoV followed by a seroprevalence study of a large Wuhan population sample.

[Dr. Taha raises very good points here and ProMED-mail would be very interested in any serosurveys that may be underway. The large scale studies one expects might take a significant time to conduct and process, but smaller studies such as of the individuals with no viruses identified in Hong Kong might be very informative (see section [3] above might yield helpful findings). - Mod.MPP
