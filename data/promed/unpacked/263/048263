RE: Bangladesh situation
------------------------
I am Dr. Jahangir from ICDDR,B and I participated in the outbreak
investigation in collaboration with Government of Bangladesh.

Just to let you know our experience and share some ideas regarding
our investigations: I agree that there might be possibilities of
missing of some gastrointestinal cases. We are planning to improve
our surveillance to find the possibilities of gastrointestinal
infection.

We did our case definition after discussion with physicians and
community members and observing (cutaneous) cases: "Any person in the
affected communities who suffered from acute onset of skin lesion
with papule or vesicle or skin ulceration with raised margin and
central black eschar from 3 weeks before the date of slaughtering of
1st sick animal to the date of interview."

We visited every household in 1st 3 outbreak communities where meats
were distributed, but we did not find any reports of cases of severe
diarrhea and abdominal cramp with fever cases from households or from
the communities during the outbreak except 2 cases with cutaneous
anthrax who complained of itching and pain in the throat.
Furthermore, among the cutaneous cases and those who ate meat from
sick animal (n=131) only 3 cases (2 percent) had diarrhea and 2 cases
(2 percent) had vomiting.

The question has been raised that we might have missed
gastrointestinal cases. So, our team is planning to visit every
household who ate meat from sick animal after including another case
definition to identify gastrointestinal cases. Suspect
gastrointestinal cases are defined as: "A person in the affected
communities who ate meat and developed a febrile illness associated
with vomiting and/or diarrhea from 3 weeks before the date of
slaughtering a 1st sick animal to the date of interview.

We will collect serum samples if any case with only gastrointestinal
symptoms is identified in previous investigation areas and we will
collect blood and oropharyngeal smear or swab if a lesion is in
oropharyngeal cavity.

RE: Bangladesh situation
------------------------
My impression is that most of this meat is consumed in the village
where the animal is slaughtered on the day it is slaughtered.

I am only aware of a single incidence where meat was sold in a local
market rather than more informal delivery. The meat has not been
dried. Nor are we aware of it being shipped over long distances, but
with the economic incentive, and the size of the outbreak, we cannot
rule this out.

Dr. Steve Luby
ICDDR,B Team Leader
<sluby@icddrb.org>

[I am very grateful to Steve and the other members of the ICDDR,B
group in Dhaka for their clarification of the gastro-intestinal risk.
His colleague Jahangir Hossain added: "I agree with Steve. Most of
the meat is cooked and consumed in the village on the day of
slaughtering. Some meats are stored in the freezer, and some are
distributed to relatives in nearby or distance village in the same
sub-district or adjacent sub-district/districts."

And Apuba Achakraborty mentioned: "In rural Bangladesh (where these
outbreaks occurred) people usually consume boiled (I'd say
overcooked) meat and there is very little or no chance of eating
raw/grilled meat there." In a word, the animals are being butchered
and the meat distributed so quickly that there is minimal sporulation
before the overcooked meat is consumed. This would explain the
apparent essential absence of g-e cases. Sporulation in general is
minimal and only anthrax spores can survive gastric passage; the
vegetative cells are killed by the gastric acidity. And cooking does
the rest.

I am also informed that there is no human vaccination happening in
Bangladesh, news reports to the contrary, nor does the government
have any plans to vaccinate the human population, only the livestock.
The most recent official tally of livestock deaths from anthrax is 43
cows and 56 goats.

Anthrax fear spreads: 92 percent dip in cattle slaughter in city
----------------------------------------------------------------
Slaughter of cattle in the capital has come down sharply, in the wake
of the anthrax scare that has seen a good number of people and cows
across the country fall victim to the disease.

Before anthrax cases started getting reported, each day between 6000
to 7000 cows were being slaughtered in the capital. Nowadays the
number has dropped drastically to around 500. That represents a fall
of almost 92 percent. In addition, nearly 8000 goats were being
slaughtered for the daily consumption of Dhakaites, but fear of
contracting the sickness has brought down that figure to around 4000.

Secretary General of the Bangladesh Meat Business Association, Rabiul
Alam, provided UNB these statistics, while expressing his dismay over
sluggish business ahead of the Eid-ul-Fitr.

Since demand for beef and mutton have plummeted, meat traders are
selling buffalo meat by displaying signs to reassure customers that
it is safe, and free from anthrax. Rabiul said although there has
been no report of anthrax affecting buffaloes, slaughter of buffaloes
has also been marked by a slight fall.

Rabiul, who is also secretary of the Gabtoli Cattle Market Committee,
revealed cattle sales have fallen drastically in the market.
According to him, around 6000 to 7000 cows, along with 200 to 400
goats were sold in the market daily, but now the figure has come down
between 100 to 150 cows and 50 to 60 goats daily.

The Department of Livestock Services (DLSS) has already set up check
posts on the western side of the Bangabandhu Bridge, as well as
Aricha and Gabtoli, to ensure no anthrax-affected animals can enter
the capital. 2 veterinary doctors and 6 other staff of the DLSS have
been on duty at Gabtoli cattle market working 2 daily shifts since 6
Sep 2010. But no anthrax-affected animal has been detected in the
market till today.

Talking to UNB, Dr Md Muzammel Haq, Thana Livestock Officer for Dhaka
District, confirmed they are yet to find any anthrax affected animal
in the Gabtoli cattle market since 6 Sep 2010.

Dr Shakwat Hossain, veterinary surgeon of Dhaka City Corporation
(DCC), said DCC Inspectors have been monitoring the situation to make
sure that no anthrax-affected cattle can be slaughtered in the city.
He, however, admitted that they could not monitor the situation with
the desired rigour due to lack of adequate manpower.

Dr Musaddique Hossain, Deputy Director of Dhaka District DLSS, told
UNB that cows have been affected by anthrax in previous years as
well. But this year, it drew the media's attention as a number of
humans too were affected by the disease.
