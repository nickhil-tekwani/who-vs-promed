Suspected outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in Kasai Occidental & Watsa
-------------------------------------------
Humanitarian sources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are
investigating a possible outbreak of haemorrhagic fever in the central
province of Kasai Occidental. A team of representatives the DRC Ministry of
Health, the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and international medical aid
NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) will transport medical supplies to
Kananga, the capital city of the province, to support a crisis unit
established there as well as to assist teams already on the ground. Blood
samples from victims will be sent to laboratories in an effort to diagnose
the virus.
Since 17 Nov 2001, 17 deaths from 30 cases have been reported in the health
zone of Dekese, centred on the village of Mbisangandu, the UN Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on Fri 7 Dec 2001.
Symptoms of victims have included vomiting, bleeding, fever, and dark,
bloody stools. Many have complained of general weakness, with death
occurring within 48 to 72 hours.
MSF warned that a second region of concern is Watsa, in the northeastern
Orientale Province, where one case of suspected haemorrhagic fever was
identified.
Viral haemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola, yellow fever, and Rift Valley
fever) causes internal bleeding that is often fatal. It is not clear yet
which virus is causing this new outbreak.
People have been warned against getting close to patients, even though they
may be relatives, the official RTNC TV reported in Kinshasa last week. Only
health workers, wearing special protective gear, are allowed to handle
patients and corpses. MSF recalled that it was involved in fighting recent
outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg fevers in the DRC, particularly in Kikwit
and Durba in 1995 and 1999. In both emergencies, MSF focused on finding new
cases as early as possible, isolating infected patients, training health
staff on how to prevent further spread of the virus, and disseminating
information to the populations of affected areas.

haemorrhagic fever, visit the website of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention at:<http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00037085.htm>

[This article mentions a second geographic area under suspicion: the Watsa
area. That was one of the areas involved in the Marburg outbreak in 1999
and 2000. As that outbreak had 2 peaks, it's possible this is yet a third
occurrence. Watsa is in the northeast of the country while Kasai province
is in the south-central of the country not too far from Kikwit, suggesting
the 2 reports of hemorrhagic fever cases may not be related in terms of
etiologic agent, just heightened awareness and reporting of viral
hemorrhagic fever. - Mod.MPP
