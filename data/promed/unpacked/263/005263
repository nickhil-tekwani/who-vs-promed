Ebolavirus has been linked to around 330 deaths in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia [AFP]

West African nations including Mali, Ivory Coast, Senegal and Guinea Bissau should prepare for the arrival of the deadly ebolavirus, the World Health Organisation said. The WHO gave warning on Friday [27 Jun 2014] that the outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia -- the worst recorded since the virus was identified [in 1976] -- had the potential to spread as travellers move between countries.

"We want other countries in West Africa to be ready -- bordering countries, Ivory Coast, Mali, Guinea Bissau -- to prepare themselves," said Pierre Formenty, a WHO medical official. He said the UN health agency is not considering recommendation of travel or trade restrictions on the 3 countries already affected by the epidemic: Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

The UN agency, which has sent more than 150 experts to West Africa to help tackle the outbreak, warned on Thursday [26 Jun 2014] that dramatic steps were needed, as the number of deaths from the virus continued to rise in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. WHO said it would convene a meeting of the health ministers from 11 countries in Accra, Ghana on 2-3 Jul [2014] to address the growing crisis.

[2] Guinea, Liberia: control measures
Date: 28 Jun 2014

The Ebola [virus disease] [EVD] outbreak in 3 West African countries is already the deadliest to date, with 635 cases and 367 fatalities, and is expected to be the longest on record, as some of the poorest countries in the world scramble to confront the fatal disease. The World Health Organization says there is an "urgent need" to coordinate the response across the borders and is convening a meeting in Accra, Ghana on 1 Jul 2014 with the 3 countries involved as well as other nations that experienced outbreaks in the past.

EVD kills more than half of its victims, and treatment largely consists of keeping the patient hydrated as the disease runs its course. Combating EVD is a matter of stopping its spread by educating people on how to protect themselves, isolating the sick and dead -- since corpses are still contagious -- and figuring out who the infected had contact with in order to isolate them as well.

Guinea
-------
The 1st case of the outbreak was identified in Guinea on 21 Mar 2014, and since then, there have been a total of 396 cases with 280 fatalities as it has spread beyond the remote rural areas to the capital city of Conakry. Experts say the outbreak may have begun as far back as January [2014]. EVD typically begins in remote places, and it can take several infections before the disease is identified, making a precise start date virtually impossible to pin down.

Education has been the main strategy of fighting the spread, and Guinea has used radio and television spots telling people how to stay safe from the disease and urging them to immediately go to hospitals if they are sick. One of the main goals is to explain to people how to deal with the dead: washing the corpse of a victim before burial, as is customary, can transmit the disease [the solution is to wear disposable gloves. - Mod.JW]. Volunteers, including survivors of the disease, have been recruited in the campaign to educate people, a campaign which is also targeting community and religious leaders.

With the help of Doctors without Borders [MSF], treatment centers have been set up in the outbreak areas, and the World Health Organization has worked to boost the capacity of the labs needed to confirm the virus's presence.

Liberia
-------
Soon after the outbreak was identified in Guinea, it appeared just across the border in neighboring Liberia on 30 Mar 2014, though since then, this small nation has been the least affected, with just 63 cases and 41 fatalities.

The Health Ministry has set up treatment centers and started a public service campaign to slow the spread of the disease, including training health professionals to use protective clothing while forbidding hospitals to turn away patients with EVD symptoms. They also have forbidden possible victims to be buried without being 1st tested and issued a death certificate to ensure that there is proper reporting of who has been affected by the disease and who they have been in contact with.

[3] Guinea: child fatal case
Date: 27 Jun 2014
Source: National Public Radio (NPR) via WGCU, USA [edited]
http://wgcu.org/post/9-year-old-ebola-sliver-hope-isnt-enough


He was a little boy, 9 years old. He and his mother had both been infected with Ebola virus disease [EVD]. She likely caught the virus while washing a deceased EVD victim, as is often the custom for burials in Guinea. Then she probably infected her child.

Once she began showing symptoms, she and her son were locked in a house for 4 days because neighbors were so scared of the virus. Medical workers learned of the case, and the mother and son were driven to a treatment center in the back of a pickup truck, along a dirt road. The mother died on the way. So the boy was admitted, alone. He was cared for by foreigners, wearing outfits that look like spacesuits to protect them from the deadly virus.

Dr. William Fischer of the University of North Carolina tended to the boy. At the time, he was working in an isolation area in Gueckedou, Guinea, as a member of the Doctors Without Borders [MSF] team that is treating people with EVD. For Fischer, the story of the little boy was one of the most heartbreaking moments during his time in Guinea. "It was probably one of the most difficult things for me to see," he says. "Not just the vomiting, the diarrhea, but the despair that was present from having seen his mother die, from being surrounded by us foreigners and just being alone." The child came in "with barely a pulse," Fischer recalls. In the isolation ward, health care workers resuscitated him, giving him fluids and antibiotics. A package of cookies coaxed a faint smile. "But he was in a tough spot," Fischer says.

Then the medical team had to leave the isolation zone. The equipment they wear, Fischer explains, offers protection for only a limited amount of time. They had "a sliver of hope" they could get him through this. But that night, the boy began vomiting blood. He died alone, no family, no one by his side.

Ebola [Virus Disease] Outbreak Response: Update
----------------------------------
From 23 May - 26 Jun 2014 (9:00 pm): 187 Laboratory confirmed EVD cases, 363 patients tested for ebolavirus (9 results pending at the date and hour of the report).

22 cases have been discharged from the Government Hospital in Kenema after full recovery from EVD.

22 recovered out of 187 confirmed EVD cases (12 percent survival, i.e. the case fatality rate (CFR) would appear to approaching 90 percent), although the number of deaths to date is not stated.

[There are graphs in this report showing the epidemic curve, which peaked at around 25 cases on 17 and 20 Jun 2014 (dates of report, not onset), and maps showing the location of cases. - Mod.JW]

[5] Sierra Leone: false beliefs
Date: 26 Jun 2014

They call him by his surname, Konneh. His manners are gentle and his voice calm. He is a volunteer with the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society, always willing to help. Although he lives in Kenema, he comes from Daru, one of the villages most affected by the Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak in Sierra Leone. His uncle and his uncle's wife have both died of EVD. 1st, they brought his uncle to Kenema, a 2-hour drive from Daru where the treatment centre for EVD patients is located. He died; 2 days later they brought his aunt. She also died. "His wife was a nurse. My uncle got it from his wife," Konneh says calmly. His cousin also died.

"When health workers start dying from EVD, the entire health care system is affected. Doctors and nurses are afraid to go to work or to treat patients, which is what we are seeing in Sierra Leone at the moment," says Amanda McClelland, senior emergency health officer at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). "However, with proper training and by taking adequate precautions, health care workers can safely treat EVD patients. And it is proven that the sooner treatment can start, the greater the chances of survival."

Most of the people affected by EVD in Sierra Leone are women, as they are the ones who take care of sick family members and relatives. They are also the ones who care for the body of a person who has died, which is highly infectious if not properly handled.

"I'm scared. EVD, it's dangerous. People are saying EVD does not exist but I've seen it. I believe it exists," Konneh says. There is a lot of fear, denial and stigma attached to the highly contagious disease, as it is the 1st time it has appeared in Sierra Leone. Some communities are not letting authorities or humanitarian actors enter, while many of those who may have come into contact with the virus and need to be watched disappear and are, therefore, unable to be traced.

Some believe that EVD is caused by witchcraft. One of the most widespread stories related to the EVD outbreak is this: A woman in a village went on a journey and left at home a box instructing her husband not to open it. The husband opens the box and finds a snake inside, which informs the husband not to reveal his presence or else the snake will kill everyone in the village. The husband does not heed the warning and spreads the word about the snake's presence. The snake goes on a killing spree.

Another story that has gained traction around Kenema is that doctors in the isolation ward are administering lethal injections to people. In the eyes of villagers, this explains why people never come back from the isolation centre. However, to date, 10 people have survived EVD and have been discharged from the hospital in Kenema and are back home with their families.

"If people believe EVD is real, we can control it. The common people, the illiterate, they only believe in what they see," Konneh explains. For those who do accept that EVD is a real disease, they believe it is fatal and, as a result, do not see the reason for seeking healthcare when they have symptoms. "An increase in awareness raising and outreach to communities will be effective in dispelling erroneous stories and beliefs," McClelland highlights. "Fighting stigma, changing behaviour and seeking hospital care as soon as possible are the key elements to fighting EVD."

At the age of 21, Konneh is no stranger to fatalities. He joined the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society 4 years ago. His father, a regional imam who played an important role in his village, was taken and killed during a time of conflict, along with his grandfather. "The Red Cross came to my village and took care of us. When they asked who wanted to be a volunteer, I said yes." Today, it is his turn to help take care of others.

IFRC has released 227 336 Swiss francs [USD 250 000] from its Disaster Relief Emergency Fund to support the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society in responding to the EVD outbreak. Activities focus largely on educating communities on how they can protect themselves and help prevent the spread of EVD. Similar emergency operations have been launched in Guinea and Liberia. Preparedness operations are underway in Cote d'Ivoire, Mali and Senegal in the event the virus begins to spread even further.

[6] Sierra Leone: patients flee hospitals
Date: 28 Jun 2014

The Sierra Leone government has warned that anyone who harbours EVD patients faces prosecution, after it emerged that patients admitted at the country's leading EVD treatment centre were once again forcefully discharging themselves.

This followed widespread rumours that medications administered by health officials were the causes of the deadly disease. An unspecified number of patients have gone into hiding, the Ministry of Health and Sanitation said Friday [27 Jun 2014], warning of the imminent danger of mass infection as a consequence.

When the outbreak was 1st confirmed, the Health ministry had a problem containing it because of reluctance by locals to cooperate. Health personnel were pelted [with stones] and driven away. But the hostilities subsided when the government drafted lawmakers and other local politicians from the opposition-dominated eastern region most affected by the outbreak. However, the sudden rise of cases and fatalities across the country recently has rekindled feelings of greater uncertainty, so much so that even medical personnel have been reported abandoning their posts after witnessing their colleagues dying.

On Friday [27 Jun 2014], state broadcaster SLBC reported that police used tear gas to disperse crowds who surrounded the Kenema government hospital, also in the east of the country, demanding the discharge of their family members. "Any person who obstructs or interferes with the performance of the medical team in any of the EVD observation and treatment centres would be guilty of an offence and liable to punishment," the health ministry warned.

[One wonders how such offenders could be safely arrested, brought to court, and, if convicted, imprisoned in isolation, given that they have been in contact with hospitalized patients who were diagnosed as EVD cases. It might be difficult to find willing police, legal counsel, and prison guards. - Mod.JW]

[Yes, how to counter the denial is the question. There is also apparently a political problem between the Sierra Leone government and the eastern region that is complicating matters. It is rather serious when tear gas has to be used to control crowds demanding that their family members be released from hospital.

This seems to be the 1st report of a confirmed case of EVD in a child; see [3] above. I wonder whether small children have been dying at home and buried without anyone notifying the health authorities? - Mod.JW
