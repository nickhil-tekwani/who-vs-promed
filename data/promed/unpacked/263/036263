A mysterious disease that has killed more than a million bats in the
eastern and southern United States has been confirmed in Maine as it
continues its spread across North America, officials said Tuesday [24
May 2011]. The disease known as white nose syndrome [WNS] was found
this spring [2011] in mines in western Maine where bats hibernate
during the winter. First identified in upstate New York in 2006, the
disease has now been confirmed in 17 states from Maine to Tennessee
and in 4 Canadian provinces.

"As it continues to spread we don't see anything slowing the spread
of the fungus down," Ann Froschauer of the US Fish and Wildlife
Service said during a conference call with reporters. "We're down into
North Carolina and Tennessee and into the Midwest in Kentucky,
Indiana, and Ohio, and we don't seem to see any slowing down of the
fungus being spread among bats in those areas."

The disease was most recently confirmed in bats found in 2 mines in
western Maine that were surveyed this spring [2011]. The state's 3rd
known bat-hibernation site, in northern Maine, showed no signs of the
disease, said John DePue, a wildlife biologist with the Maine
Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.

The spread of white nose syndrome could have significant ecological
consequences. The million bats already killed would have eaten roughly
1.5 million to 3 million pounds of insects a year, providing
pest-control services for farmers and forest managers, officials
said.

With bat populations going down, the volume of mosquitoes and other
pests -- including those that damage agricultural crops and trees --
is going up. A recent study published in the journal Science has
estimated that the insect-eating bats save the US agricultural
industry at least USD 3 billion a year in pest-control services.

The spread of the disease could result in more crop and tree damage
and in the increased use of pesticides to control pest populations.
Scientists don't know for sure where the fungus came from, although
indicators suggest it might have come from Europe, officials said.
They also aren't exactly sure how it kills bats, but one theory is
that the fungus irritates the noses, wings, and ears and causes bats
to often awaken during hibernation and burn so much energy that they
starve to death before spring. Scientists also believe the fungus
erodes tissues and disrupts the bats' abilities to regulate their
temperatures and stay hydrated.

It does not affect humans, but the fungus can be spread by people and
[officials] are urging cavers and researchers to stay away from caves
and mines during winter hibernation months. People are being asked to
allow bats roosting in their homes and other structures to rear their
young and exit the structures at the end of the summer before closing
off any entrance holes.

The disease has been confirmed in [the US] in Connecticut, Delaware,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,
Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia, as well as in New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec [in Canada]. 2 additional states,
Missouri and Oklahoma, have identified the fungus but not the disease,
Froschauer said.

[While the fungus causing the disease is also found in bats in
Europe, the bats apparently are immune to it. However, the fungus
found in the USA seems to have some genetic differences and may not be
exactly the same fungus. Research is ongoing to determine if this is
the case and potentially lead to finding a cure.
