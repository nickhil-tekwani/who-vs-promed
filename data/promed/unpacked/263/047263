Multistate outbreak of hepatitis A virus infections linked to pomegranate seeds from Turkey
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of hepatitis A virus infections. Results from the ongoing investigation are highlighted below.

Epidemiologic investigations
----------------------------
As of 2 Jul 2013, 136 people have been confirmed to have become ill from hepatitis A after eating 'Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend in 8 states: Arizona (20), California (67), Colorado (25), Hawaii (7), New Mexico (6), Nevada (6), Utah (3), and Wisconsin (2). [Note: the cases reported from Wisconsin resulted from exposure to the product in California.] 76 (56 percent) ill people are women, ages range from 1-84 years; 79 (58 percent) of those ill were between 40 and 64 years of age. 8 children age 18 or under were also ill. None were previously vaccinated.

Illness onset dates range from 31 Mar 2013 to 24 Jun 2013. 59 (43 percent) ill people (all over 18 years of age) have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. All ill people who reported eating this product purchased it from Costco markets; however, the product was also sold at Harris Teeter stores. No ill people have been identified that bought the product at Harris Teeter at this time. CDC continues to track hepatitis A cases in all states and test specimens in order to determine if any other cases are related to this outbreak.

Laboratory investigation
------------------------
The outbreak strain of hepatitis A virus, belonging to genotype 1B, was found in clinical specimens of 56 people in 7 states: Arizona (6), California (15), Colorado (22), Hawaii (4), New Mexico (4), Nevada (4) and Wisconsin (1; this person was exposed in California). This genotype is rarely seen in the Americas but circulates in North Africa and the Middle East. This genotype was identified in a 2013 outbreak of hepatitis A virus infections in Europe linked to frozen berries and a 2012 outbreak in British Columbia [Canada] related to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt. However, there is no evidence at this time that these outbreaks are related to the ongoing US outbreak.

Regulatory investigation
------------------------
By combining information gained from FDA's traceback and traceforward investigations and the CDC's epidemiological investigation, FDA and CDC have determined that the most likely vehicle for the hepatitis A virus appears to be a common shipment of pomegranate seeds from a company in Turkey, Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading. FDA will detain shipments of pomegranate seeds from Goknur when they are offered for import into the United States.

These pomegranate seeds were used by Townsend Farms to make the Townsend Farms and Harris Teeter Organic Antioxidant Blends and by Scenic Fruit Company to make the Woodstock Frozen Organic Pomegranate Kernels. FDA will be working with the firms that have distributed pomegranate seeds from this shipment from Turkey to help ensure that all recipients of these seeds are notified.

On 4 Jun 2013, Townsend Farms, Inc. of Fairview, Oregon voluntarily recalled certain lots of its frozen Organic Antioxidant Blend [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm355166.htm] because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination. On 28 Jun 2013, Townsend Farms, Inc. of Fairview, Oregon, expanded its voluntary limited lot recall of frozen Organic Antioxidant Blend, 3 lb [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm359140.htm] because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination.

On 26 Jun 2013, Scenic Fruit Company of Gresham, Oregon recalled specific lots of Woodstock Frozen Organic Pomegranate Kernels [http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm358740.htm] because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination.

Additional information regarding these recalls is updated regularly at http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm354698.htm

Consumers should not eat recalled products containing pomegranate seeds. The recalled products should be discarded.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka

[This outbreak now seems to have run its course as a result of the recall and voluntary withdrawal of all suspected contaminated products. All the evidence suggests a single component, pomegranate seeds, common to all the differently packaged Frozen Berry products. An identical strain of hepatitis A was isolated from all the patients tested, and known to be present in the Middle East where the pomegranate seeds originated. It is not stated, however, that the virus was isolated from the incriminated batch of Turkish pomegranate seeds.
