[1] Southeast Asia, general
Date: Fri 26 Dec 2014

The dengue fever situation in Asia varies depending on the country. Last week, we reported that Malaysia's dengue case count has about tripled 2013's numbers, with some 100 000 cases.

China's Guangdong province saw large increases of the mosquito borne virus, as has Taiwan, which has reported in excess of 15 000 cases while reporting less than 900 in 2013.

Malaysia's neighbor in southeast Asia, Indonesia, has reported 71 668 cases of dengue fever as of mid-December [2014]. In addition, the archipelago has seen nearly 650 succumb to the mosquito borne virus. While these numbers appear bad, and they are, it's an improvement compared to what the country saw in 2013.

The Indonesian Health Ministry recorded 112 511 cases and 871 fatalities in 2013. However, certain areas of the country have seen increases, according to the Jakarta Globe. These include North Sumatra, Riau, West Kalimantan, North Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, Bali and Jakarta. This year's [2014] case count and death toll (641) has prompted health officials to advise the public to eliminate mosquito breeding sites around their houses, adding larvicides to water containers and sleeping under a mosquito net.
