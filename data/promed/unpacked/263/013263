A 26-year-old suspected bird flu patient from Ciruluk village, in
Subang, died Wed 21 Feb 2007 at the Hasan Sadikin Hospital in
Bandung, 2 days after many of his chickens began dying. The [victim]
was a police 2nd brigadier who died after being treated at the
hospital's isolation ward for 2 hours. He [had been treated] earlier
at the Ci'ereng Hospital in Subang, for 5 hours.
A relative said the victim's symptoms began Mon 19 Feb 2007 when he
returned from duty at Cipeundeuy police station in Subang with
breathing difficulties. "Many chickens in our village have died
abruptly for unclear reasons in the past week," Wasimin said at Hasan
Sadikin Hospital on Thursday [22 Feb 2007].
Ciruluk's village chief, Norwon, said more than 9000 chickens and
ducks had died in the past 2 weeks. Some of them had been examined
and were found to be infected with the H5N1 virus. "Around 4000
free-range chickens owned by 2 residents have even died in the past
week," Norwon said.
The head of the Bird Flu Prevention Team at Hasan Sadikin Hospital,
Hadi Jusuf, said [the victim] was likely infected via direct contact
with his infected chickens. To confirm this, [his] blood and fluid
samples were sent to the Health Ministry's lab in Jakarta on Thursday
[22 Feb 2007].
