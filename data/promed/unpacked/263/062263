Within the last 8-12 weeks, cases of Lassa fever in the endemic states of
Edo, Plateau, Lagos, Ogun, Nasarawa, Taraba, Borno, and Anambra have
reoccurred, with 8 fatalities.

Minister of health, Professor Adenike Grange, who disclosed the cases
yesterday [8 Jun 2008] in Abuja, said the World Health Organization (WHO)
and a team of health supervisors from the ministry confirmed these
outbreaks. Grange disclosed that an on-the-spot assessment of Zaria, Kaduna
State, which is one of the most affected areas, confirmed that the
situation needed the urgent intervention of the federal government.

According to her, a team of experts had already been dispatched to the
endemic areas to determine the extent of the outbreaks, as well as to
initiate preventive and containment measures in affected communities, and
to report to the ministry.

[It appears that there have been Lassa fever cases in several localities in
Nigeria recently. The article does not indicate whether these cases have
been laboratory confirmed. ProMED-mail would appreciate learning of the
results of follow-up efforts being made in the affected regions.

Lassa fever virus, in the arenavirus family, is endemic in West Africa in
the rodent _Mastomys_ spp. A description of Lassa fever and its
epidemiology, with an image of _Mastomys_, can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm>.

Lassa fever, a hemorrhagic disease, is a common infection in West Africa,
with estimates that range from 100 000 to 300 000 cases annually, with 5000
deaths. Prevention of transmission from rodents to people requires
continuous rodent control. This is extraordinarily difficult to get
ordinary people to do in the absence of human cases in their immediate
vicinity. Many cases occur in hospital settings where barrier nursing is
not practiced and staff are exposed to blood, exudates, and excreta from
infected patients. Infection of health care staff is common.
