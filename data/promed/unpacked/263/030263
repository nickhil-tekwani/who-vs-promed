Bird flu has spread to the Bangladesh capital Dhaka and to the port
city Chittagong despite efforts by authorities to contain it,
livestock officials said on Wednesday [6 Feb 2008].

Dozens of dead crows found over the past 2 days in Dhaka have tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu. City authorities have
ordered a ban on the sale of undressed chicken in Dhaka markets, the
officials said.

In Chittagong, officials confirmed the spread of bird flu in several
farms and also in crows that tested positive for the strain.

The virus has spread to 38 out of Bangladesh's 64 districts and
forced the culling of nearly 500 000 birds across the country.

Bird flu was 1st detected in Bangladesh at a poultry farm near the
capital last March [2007], but so far has not infected humans in the
densely populated country.

Lack of awareness about the virus is still widespread in the country,
officials and media reports said.

On Wednesday [6 Feb 2008], a Dhaka newspaper printed a photograph of
a man collecting dead crows at the city's main Ramna Park with no
mask and using his bare hands.

Touching or eating sick poultry can lead to infection by the H5N1
virus, which has killed more than 220 people globally since late 2003.

Some 3066 fowl, ducks and pigeons were culled, and 2385 eggs have
been destroyed at Saralia village in Morelganj sub-district in
Bangladesh's southern Bagerhat district after detection of avian influenza.

Livestock officers conducted the operation Tuesday [5 Feb 2008] night
with the help of joint forces after detection of the H5N1 virus in
dead chickens of a poultry farm at the village, private news agency
UNB reported Wednesday [6 Feb 2008].

They also imposed a ban on selling, rearing and carrying chickens,
ducks and pigeons in and around a one-km area of the affected farm.

As some 900 chickens of the poultry farm died on Sunday [3 Feb 2008],
livestock officials collected the samples of some dead chickens and
sent those for laboratory testing. After getting the test report of
the bird flu Tuesday [5 Feb 2008] night, they immediately conducted a
drive at 2 poultry farms and 134 houses in the area.

The avian influenza virus was 1st detected in a poultry farm in
Savar, about 30 km northwest of the capital Dhaka, in March 2007. The
situation has been getting worse since last month [January 2008], as
the bird flu virus is spreading fast across the country.

The bird flu control room sources said so far 37 out of a total 64
districts in the country have been affected by the bird flu.

A dead black-crowned night heron found earlier in southern Hong Kong
has tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus, authorities in the
neighboring region said Friday [1 Feb 2008]. The dead heron,
collected Monday at the Ocean Park, one of the major tourist
attractions in Hong Kong, was "confirmed to be H5N1 positive after a
series of laboratory tests," the Agriculture, Fisheries and
Conservation Department said.

The Ocean Park announced Thursday [31 Jan 2008] it was to shut down
the walk-through aviaries for 21 days after the heron found in the
park was suspected of being H5 positive.

The black-crowned night heron is a common resident and winter
visitor, a spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department was quoted as saying.

Hong Kong had recently recorded several cases of dead birds testing
positive for the H5N1 strain. Hong Kong has been monitoring bird
movements and had many measures in place to contain the spread of the
deadly virus. The spokesman on Friday [1 Feb 2008] also reminded the
public to observe good personal hygiene. "They should avoid personal
contact with wild birds or live poultry and clean their hands
thoroughly after coming into contact with them," he said.

Turkish authorities said Tuesday [5 Feb 2008] that bird flu has been
detected in poultry in a village in the northwest of the country, the
Anatolia news agency reported.

The outbreak was discovered in the village of Yenicam, Sakarya
province, where dozens of chickens died recently, the governor's
office said in a statement carried by the agency.

"The test results have come back positive," it said, adding that
further tests were underway to determine whether the virus was the
highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.

A 10-km (6-mile) surveillance zone has been set up around the
village, inside which vets have culled nearly 700 animals and carried
out health checks on residents, the statement said.

Health director Hasan Bektas told Anatolia there were so far no
symptoms of the disease among the local population. "All necessary
measures have been taken, and there is no reason to worry," the
statement from the governor's office said. At the weekend, the
Turkish agriculture ministry said it had detected a bird flu outbreak
in the city of Samsun on the Black Sea Coast, nearly 600 km (370
miles) east of Sakarya.

In January 2006, 4 teenagers were killed in a remote Turkish town
near the border with Iran in a major outbreak of the H5N1 virus,
which then quickly spread to more than half of the country's 81 provinces.

They were the 1st human casualties of the H5N1 strain outside southeast Asia.

In April 2007, Turkey declared itself free of the virus.

[Seasonal spread of H5N1 has become, since 2004, an expected
phenomenon; the Black sea environs being one of the main areas
involved, probably due to a combination of migratory bird movements
and deficient biosecurity measures.

Two of Turkey's regions appear to have already been affected, while
other countries around the Black sea, such as Romania and Ukraine
(Crimea) have, reportedly, been affected as well recently. An
official Turkish report, and final serotyping of the H5 virus, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
