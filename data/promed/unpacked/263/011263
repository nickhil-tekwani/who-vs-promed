The COVID-19 pandemic entered its next chapter in the United States on Thursday [2 Dec 2021] when health officials reported at least 8 new cases of the alarming omicron variant: 5 in New York, one each in Colorado and Hawaii, and another in a Minnesota man who had recently traveled to New York City.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said during a news conference Thursday [2 Dec 2021] evening that 5 people had tested positive for omicron, including a 67-year-old woman from Long Island who had traveled to South Africa. The other cases were among 2 residents of Queens, one resident of Brooklyn and one resident of New York City.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment confirmed its 1st case of the omicron variant Thursday [2 Dec 2021] afternoon in a vaccinated female resident of Arapahoe County who had recently traveled to southern Africa for tourism.

The Minnesota Department of Health reported Thursday [2 Dec 2021] morning that a resident of the Gopher State who had recently traveled to New York City had tested positive for the omicron variant. At the time, the case was the 1st in the United States of a person who had not been overseas to places where the variant was known to be circulating.

And Thursday [2 Dec 2021] evening the Hawaii Department of Health confirmed its 1st case of the omicron variant in an unvaccinated Oahu resident who had no travel history outside the state and was previously infected with the coronavirus in 2020.

The announcements come a day after San Francisco public health officials reported that they had identified the 1st US case of the omicron variant in a San Francisco resident who recently returned from South Africa, where the variant's rapid spread has put health officials around the world on high alert.

Thursday's [2 Dec 2021] developments suggest it may already be established in the United States. "This news is concerning, but it is not a surprise," Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement from the state health department. "We know that this virus is highly infectious and moves quickly throughout the world."

President Joe Biden announced a plan for combating spread of the virus over the winter that includes promoting vaccines for children ages 5 and older, booster shots for adults, free at-home tests for the virus, and expanded "strike teams" to assist areas with severe outbreaks.

Dr. George Rutherford, an epidemiologist at the University of California-San Francisco, which was involved in confirming California's case, was not surprised by the additional cases. "It was likely pretty widely spread before its discovery was announced," he said.

But he said that doesn't necessarily mean the variant is everywhere. Nonstop flights from South Africa only come into a handful of US airports, and it's possible the infected had crossed paths in the airport. "We have to do a cluster investigation to really figure it out," he said. "Yes, we have omicron here. Yes, we're going to get more of it over time."

Minnesota health officials said the person infected with the omicron variant is a fully vaccinated adult male who had a booster dose in early November [2021]. The person developed mild symptoms on 22 Nov 2021 after traveling to New York City and attending the Anime NYC 2021 convention at the Javits Center 19-21 Nov 2021. He sought COVID-19 testing on 24 Nov 2021.

He isolated from others while Minnesota epidemiologists investigated in collaboration with New York City and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The health department said the man's symptoms have since resolved.

Hochul said that the vaccination status of all the confirmed New York cases is unknown, but the Long Island woman who traveled to South Africa had some "vaccination history." The woman tested negative on 25 Nov 2021 upon her return to the states. A 2nd test on 30 Nov 2021 was positive.

Colorado health officials said the woman infected with the omicron variant is experiencing minor symptoms and is isolated and recuperating at home. She had been fully vaccinated and was eligible for the booster shot but had not received it yet.

Health officials reiterated that vaccination and wearing face masks are the best defense against the virus.

While the World Health Organization has declared omicron as a variant of concern, scientists are still working to determine how it may compare with the dominant delta variant in terms of transmissibility and disease severity. Scientists also are studying the degree to which existing vaccines and therapies protect against the newest variant.

On Wednesday [1 Dec 2021], in response to a question about whether new lockdowns will be imposed now that a case of omicron had been detected in California on 1 Dec 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom said that "none of us want to see that happen" and that he saw "no indication at this moment that that's in our immediate future."

San Francisco Health Director Dr. Grant Colfax also said Wednesday [1 Dec 2021] that "we do not anticipate changing any of our health orders or imposing new restrictions on activity in San Francisco" in light of the omicron variant's arrival. Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody also indicated no expected changes in mandates.

President Biden said Thursday [2 Dec 2021] that his plan "doesn't include shutdowns or lockdowns, but widespread vaccinations and boosters and testing and more." Biden said more than 100 million Americans are now eligible for booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccines, meaning it's been 6 months since their last Pfizer or Moderna shot or 2 since their Johnson & Johnson shot. Biden said his administration would be setting up hundreds of family vaccination clinics across the country and would make at-home tests for the virus free, just like those at hospitals and clinics.

Starting early next week, the United States will tighten pre-departure testing by requiring all inbound international travelers to be tested for the virus within one day of departure globally, regardless of nationality or vaccination status. Currently, vaccinated travelers can be tested up to 3 days before departure.

[The omicron variant appears to have been circulating under the radar since mid-November (2021), if not earlier. It is being detected widely now that it is being looked for. From the several superspreader events already reported, cases clearly will increase rapidly, but severity -- in light of the high vaccination rate -- will hopefully be low.

The New York Times from 2 Dec 2021 (https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/02/health/omicron-variant-genetic-surveillance.html) has a report "Why Didn't the US Detect Omicron Cases Sooner?" by Emily Anthes, excerpts of which follow.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Genomic surveillance has improved enormously in recent months, but the system has built-in delays, and blind spots remain.... Even after the CDC launched a sequencing consortium in May 2020, sequencing efforts [in the US] were stymied by a fragmented healthcare system, a lack of funding and other challenges.

"In January [2021], when cases were surging, the United States was sequencing fewer than 3000 samples a week, according to the CDC's dashboard, far less than 1% of reported cases. (Experts recommend sequencing at least 5% of cases.) But in recent months, the situation has improved dramatically, thanks to a combination of new federal leadership, an infusion of funding and an increasing concern about the emergence and spread of new variants, experts said.

"'Genomic surveillance really has caught up in the US, and it is very good,' said Dana Crawford, a genetic epidemiologist at Case Western Reserve University. The country is now sequencing approximately 80 000 virus samples a week and 14% of all positive PCR tests, which are conducted in labs and considered the gold standard for detecting the virus, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a White House briefing on Tuesday [30 Nov 2021].

"The problem is that the process takes time, especially when done in volume. The CDC's own sequencing process typically takes about 10 days to complete after it receives a specimen.

"'We have really good surveillance in terms of quantity,' said Trevor Bedford, an expert on viral evolution and surveillance at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. He added, 'But by nature, it lags compared to your case reporting. And so we'll have good eyes on things from 2 weeks ago.'"

"There are other, more optimistic reasons that scientists have not detected more cases, although they remain theoretical. 'Perhaps infected patients have mild symptoms, and hence are not getting tested and are not subject to genomic surveillance,' said Janet Robishaw, the senior associate dean for research at the Florida Atlantic University College of Medicine.

"(It is still far too early to know whether omicron causes disease that is any more or less severe than other variants, scientists stress. Even if the cases are disproportionately mild, which is not yet clear, that could be because the variant has mostly infected young or vaccinated people so far, who are less likely to develop severe disease.)

"It is also possible that there was not much community spread of the variant in the United States until recently. When the cases are mostly isolated, and tied to foreign travel, they can fly under the surveillance radar."

"'It is conceivable that omicron spread is lagging behind in the US,'" Dr. Caputi [molecular virologist at the Florida Atlantic University School of Medicine] said in an email. Either way, he added, he expected scientists to find more cases soon." - Mod.LK]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
Background: There are concerns regarding post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, but it is unclear whether COVID-19 poses a significant downstream mortality risk. The objective was to determine the relationship between COVID-19 infection and 12-month mortality after recovery from the initial episode of COVID-19 in adult patients.

Methods: An analysis of electronic health records (EHR) was performed for a cohort of 13 638 patients, including COVID-19-positive and a comparison group of COVID-19-negative patients, who were followed for 12 months post-COVID-19 episode at one health system. Both COVID-19-positive patients and COVID-19-negative patients were PCR validated. COVID-19-positive patients were classified as severe if they were hospitalized within the first 30 days of the date of their initial positive test. The 12-month risk of mortality was assessed in unadjusted Cox regressions and those adjusted for age, sex, race and comorbidities. Separate subgroup analyses were conducted for (a) patients aged 65 and older and (b) those <65 years.

Results: Of the 13 638 patients included in this cohort, 178 had severe COVID-19, 246 had mild/moderate COVID-19, and 13 214 were COVID-19 negative. In the cohort, 2686 died in the 12-month period. The 12-month adjusted all-cause mortality risk was significantly higher for patients with severe COVID-19 compared to both COVID-19-negative patients (HR 2.50; 95% CI 2.02, 3.09) and mild COVID-19 patients (HR 1.87; 95% CI 1.28, 2.74). The vast majority of deaths (79.5%) were for causes other than respiratory or cardiovascular conditions. Among patients aged <65 years, the pattern was similar, but the mortality risk for patients with severe COVID-19 was increased compared to both COVID-19-negative patients (HR 3.33; 95% CI 2.35, 4.73) and mild COVID-19 patients (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.59, 5.04). Patients aged 65 and older with severe COVID-19 were also at increased 12-month mortality risk compared to COVID-19-negative patients (HR 2.17; 95% CI 1.66, 2.84) but not mild COVID-19 patients (HR 1.41; 95% CI 0.84, 2.34).

Discussion: Patients with a COVID-19 hospitalization were at significantly increased risk for future mortality. In a time when nearly all COVID-19 hospitalizations are preventable, this study points to an important and under-investigated sequela of COVID-19 and the corresponding need for prevention.

Discussion
----------
...There were no significant differences in mortality risk between patients with mild/moderate infection and the COVID-19 negatives, suggesting the value of vaccinations at preventing death from the downstream complications of COVID-19.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates a previously undocumented risk to infection with COVID-19, particularly for patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19. These patients have a substantially increased risk for mortality over the next 12 months. The benefits of preventing severe COVID-19 goes beyond flattening the curve for overwhelming the health system with hospitalized patients but extends to decreased 12-month mortality risk for conditions other than COVID-19 directly.

[3] AstraZeneca: blood clots
Date: Thu 2 Dec 2021 12:59 EST
Source: Daily Mail [abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10266585/AstraZeneca-uncovers-trigger-blood-clots-jab.html


Scientists believe they have solved the mystery behind the extremely rare blood clots caused by the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A team of international experts, involving researchers from AstraZeneca, say that in a very small number of cases -- about one in 100 000 in the UK -- the vaccine can set off a chain reaction which leads to the body confusing its own blood platelets for fragments of virus.

The UK Government gave an emergency grant to a team of scientists led by Cardiff University to investigate the clotting phenomenon. They found that the shell of the vector vaccine -- the weakened cold virus used to teach cells how to neutralise COVID -- sometimes acts like a magnet and attracts platelets, a protein found in the blood.

For reasons the scientists are still probing, the body then mistakes these platelets as a threat and produces antibodies to fight them. The combination of the platelets and the antibodies clumping together leads to the formation of dangerous blood clots.

The scientists demonstrated the adenovirus in the Oxford-AstraZeneca is negatively charged and could attract positively charged proteins like a magnet. The researchers believe that in a case of "mistaken identity" the body's immune system considers this platelet cluster as threat and releases antibodies to attack it, clumping together to it and triggering potentially life-threatening blood clots.

This condition is called vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT).... But they stress this is extremely rare, with only 426 cases in the UK recorded so far out of about 50 million doses of the vaccine, equivalent to less than 1 in 100 000. The side effect has been linked to 73 deaths in the UK.

Researchers are now doing further work to learn more about the process that causes these clots and if the vaccine can be tweaked to reduce this risk.

Studies have showed the benefits of giving AstraZeneca's vaccine to 40- to 49-year-olds outweighed the potential risks, with the jab preventing 1.7 ICU admissions per 100 000 people, compared to the risk of 1.2 blood clots per 100 000 people. However, this risk/benefit calculation swung the other way when it came to younger age-groups.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
"Vaccines derived from chimpanzee adenovirus Y25 (ChAdOx1), human adenovirus type 26 (HAdV-D26), and human adenovirus type 5 (HAdV-C5) are critical in combatting the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. As part of the largest vaccination campaign in history, ultrarare side effects not seen in phase 3 trials, including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), a rare condition resembling heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), have been observed. This study demonstrates that all 3 adenoviruses deployed as vaccination vectors versus SARS-CoV-2 bind to platelet factor 4 (PF4), a protein implicated in the pathogenesis of HIT. We have determined the structure of the ChAdOx1 viral vector and used it in state-of-the-art computational simulations to demonstrate an electrostatic interaction mechanism with PF4, which was confirmed experimentally by surface plasmon resonance. These data confirm that PF4 is capable of forming stable complexes with clinically relevant adenoviruses, an important step in unraveling the mechanisms underlying TTS."

Discussion
----------
"...The ChAdOx1/PF4 interaction described in this study suggests potential mechanisms by which safer viral vectors might be engineered by ablating this interaction. 'HVR swaps' have been performed with the goal of reducing recognition of adenovirus vector by neutralizing antibodies. Similar rational capsid engineering could eliminate electronegative residues in the HVRs, although a threshold below which the electronegative charge needs to be reduced has yet to be determined. Alternatively, upon determining key binding residues, a more specific approach could be envisaged where critical amino acids forming contacts with PF4 are removed or substituted. Therefore, modification of the ChAdOx1 hexon HVRs to reduce their electronegativity may solve 2 problems simultaneously: reduce the propensity to cause TTS and reduce the levels of antivector immunity, thus helping to maximize the opportunity to induce robust immune responses. Further exploration of adenovirus phylogenetic diversity may yield novel vectors with lower PF4-binding propensity and altered safety profiles.

"Now, no proposed mechanism for TTS following vaccination is consistent with all the observed data. This is partly due to an incomplete clinical picture, a consequence of its rarity, consequently weak statistical data from which to draw inferences, and a lack of understanding about this novel interaction. Future work will focus upon clarifying whether the adenovirus/PF4 complex is inherently thrombogenic and, if so, what downstream interactions lead to this." - Mod.LK]

[4] Argentina (Tierra del Fuego): outbreak on tourist cruise
Date: Wed 1 Dec 2021
Source: Diario Popular (via ProMED-ESP digest article title translations - vol 55, issue 268) [original in Spanish, edited]
https://www.diariopopular.com.ar/general/coronavirus-brote-casos-un-crucero-que-arribo-ushuaia-n602425; in English https://today.in-24.com/coronavirus/665137.html


The "Ultramarine" cruise ship, with 173 crew members on board and 9 confirmed cases of coronavirus, will continue to be isolated in the port of Ushuaia until at least 2 Dec 2021, when a general test of the crew will be carried out, government sources confirmed this Tuesday [30 Nov 2021].

The ship of the company "Quark Expeditions" fired the 1st alert when, in the analysis prior to its docking at the Tierra del Fuego port terminal, it showed 4 positive cases of COVID-19. Later, PCR studies carried out on all embarked persons raised the number of infections to 9, and since 25 Nov 2021 the ship remains in "complete isolation, nobody goes up or down," informed the consulted spokesmen.

"The positive thing is that none of them suffered from the disease with serious symptoms or hospitalization in the city was necessary. The idea is to carry out a massive test again on Thursday [2 Dec 2021] to see if they all test negative or if the isolation should continue," explained the Secretary of Health Systems Management of the Fuegian Ministry of Health, Javier Barrios.

He also noted that during this period, the cruise ship maintained a series of internal protocols. "There are 3 doctors on board, in addition to a private company from Ushuaia hired to follow up the cases that presents daily information to the Ministry," the secretary explained.

The official mentioned that after the arrival in Ushuaia, the authorities provided the crew with water and food, in addition to having received the pathological residues and the liquid tanks of the ship having been emptied "within strict security measures," he said.

According to Barrios, the vessel remains "isolated" and "controlled" pending its release. "Until they all give negative, the ship is not released. Fortunately, the internal protocols worked, and the same crew reported the initial cases. There was no need for hospitalization of any patient, but if necessary we are prepared for that," he warned.

The cruise ship arrived in Ushuaia on 25 Nov 2021 only with the crew, and with the aim of embarking 199 passengers (mostly foreigners) on an adventure trip to Antarctica. The tourists were to arrive in the capital of Tierra del Fuego on a charter flight that has now been rescheduled.

This is the 2nd time that the protocol against COVID has been activated in the Fuegian port, since the opening of the season at the end of October [2021]. The previous opportunity was due to the appearance of a positive case corresponding to a crew member of the cruise ship "Crystal Endeavor", which arrived in the city on 17 Nov 2021. The infected person had the disease in isolation and was discharged a few days later, without affecting the rest of the members of the boat.

The "Ultramarine," the newest in the company's fleet, is designed for travel through the polar zones. It has 2 twin-engine helicopters and has facilities specially designed for observing wildlife in the open air, as well as having luxury services on board.
