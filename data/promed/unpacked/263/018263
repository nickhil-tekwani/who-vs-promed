Growers of onions in Argentina are finishing the 2009-10 season,
which was marked by disease problems due to bacterial blight.
Although the product will be of good quality, placing the product in
foreign markets was much more complicated. The disease is due to
excess water and attacks the bulb resulting in decay during storage
or transport.

The situation highly affected the export of onions to Europe because,
during the 20 days between harvest and arrival at the destination,
the disease progresses and produce packaged without symptoms arrives
rotten and is rejected. Producers suffered losses and recorded the
lowest export shipments to Europe of the past 15 years.

In the current 2009-10 season about 15 000 hectares [37 000 acres]
were planted to onions, but due to problems of drought and disease
only 12 000 [29 700 acres] could be harvested. Exports to Brazil
increased considerably, because there, requirements for onion imports
are different.

[Bacterial blight of onion is a serious disease, which emerged over
the past decade in several tropical and subtropical areas in
different parts of the world. In 2000 in Japan, the new pathovar
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _allii_ was identified as its cause.
Symptoms may include irregular grey leaf spots expanding into overall
blight, tip dieback, stunting, and possibly death of plants. Disease
development is favoured by warm and humid conditions, and heavy rains
are thought to be a trigger for epidemics.

Bacteria may enter the host through wounds due to, for example,
insect activity, hail or injuries inflicted during cultivation. The
pathogen can survive in crop debris, volunteer onions and some
leguminous hosts. It is seed borne and also spread by water (wind
splashed rain, irrigation), plant material, and mechanical means
(contaminated equipment). Disease management is best achieved by an
integrated approach, which includes phytosanitation, cultural
measures (crop rotation, avoiding wounding during planting), use of
clean planting material, and bactericidal sprays (for example copper
compounds). Completely resistant onion varieties are not known, but
cultivars with reduced sensitivity are available.

Other pathovars of _X. axonopodis_ affect a range of crops, for
example pv.s _citri_ and _aurantifolii_ cause citrus canker, pv.
_punicae_ causes oily spot of pomegranate, and pv. _vesicatoria_
causes bacterial spot of tomato and capsicum.
