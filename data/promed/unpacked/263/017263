A mumps outbreak on the East Coast -- the largest in the United
States in 4 years -- may be spreading to Los Angeles [LA] County. So
far this year [2010], 9 cases of mumps have been reported, 2 more
than were seen in all of 2009, according to county health officer
Jonathan Fielding.

Four of the mumps cases may be related to an outbreak, largely among
Orthodox Jews, that has persisted in New York and New Jersey for
almost a year. According to the New York State Department of Health,
there have been more than 2800 confirmed and probable mumps cases in
New York and 315 in New Jersey. The outbreak has also spread to
Quebec [Canada], where 20 mumps cases have been linked to the New
York outbreak, and to Israel, where more than 2600 have been infected.

Dr David Keene, a pediatrician in Beverly Hills, saw 2 mumps cases
recently, involving a student who attends the private high school
Yeshiva Ohr Elchonon Chabad in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles
and a 2-year-old whose uncle attends the school. "A lot of people
went traveling at Passover, which was about six weeks ago. They went
home and visited their friends with mumps, and three weeks later they
got sick," Keene said.

Health officials said the Orthodox Jewish community as a whole has
high vaccination rates, which is limiting the outbreak's size. The
problem is that the vaccine is not completely effective. One dose is
73 percent to 91 percent effective; those who get a booster shot see
79 percent to 95 percent effectiveness. "Sometimes, when mumps gets
established somewhat in a community and you determine immunization
rates are pretty high, sometimes it just has to run its course," said
Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The New York outbreak began in June 2009 when an unvaccinated
11-year-old boy visited Britain, where mumps outbreaks remain a
problem. He then attended a summer camp in New York's Sullivan County
for Jewish boys. The disease, transmitted by coughing and sneezing,
spread when the campers returned home.

The outbreak fits the profile of the last major US mumps outbreak in
2006, spreading in places where people have prolonged, close contact.
Outbreaks have been notable at boys-only Orthodox Jewish schools,
where students sit for long periods facing a study partner. Another
reason could be the larger size of many Orthodox families, the CDC said.

Rabbi Chaim Cunin of Chabad of California, a Westwood-based Orthodox
group, said his community has been monitoring the outbreak since last
year [2009]. "We live in a frequent-flier age. If the Jewish
community on the East Coast has an issue, it's certainly something we
would monitor on the West Coast," Cunin said. Private Jewish schools
have been on a "heightened state of alert" to quickly send sick
children home, he said.

Mumps, which causes fever, aches, and fatigue, can also swell
salivary glands, causing what are called "chipmunk cheeks." Most
people recover within 10 days. Before the vaccine was released in
1967, about 186 000 people in the United States got the mumps every
year, but the number has since fallen to fewer than 500 cases
annually. Keene said some of the rare complications of mumps include
deafness and inflammation of the testicles. If that happens in males
after adolescence, it could in rare cases cause sterility.

Health officials have been concerned about a drop in childhood
vaccinations based on allegations, since discredited, that vaccines
cause autism. The Times in 2009 reported that a rising number of
California parents were choosing to send their children to
kindergarten without routine vaccinations, putting hundreds of
elementary schools in the state at risk for outbreaks of childhood
diseases eradicated in the US years ago.

[The current outbreak of mumps in California may be a delayed
consequence of the outbreak, largely among Orthodox Jews, that has
persisted in New York and New Jersey for almost a year, and
subsequently spread to Canada (Quebec) and Israel. This report
suggests that the spread of mumps in the Orthodox Jewish community
may not be due to lesser uptake of vaccine than in the rest of the
population but rather is a consequence of 2 social factors, namely
larger family size and educational practices. These outbreaks have
often occurred at boys-only Orthodox Jewish schools, where students
sit for long periods facing a study partner, providing greater
opportunity for transfer of infection.
