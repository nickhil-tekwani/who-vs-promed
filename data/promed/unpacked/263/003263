Detection of BTV-11 RNA in Belgium
----------------------------------
An EDTA-blood sample from a cow without clinical signs, which gave early
birth to a newborn calf that died soon after delivery, turned out to be
positive in a group-specific real-time RT-PCR [reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction] (Toussaint et al, 2007) (Ct 30) used in the
Belgium National Reference Laboratory for Bluetongue. The in-house
serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR assays against BTV 1, 6, and 8 were
negative. These results were confirmed using the group-specific and
serotype-specific real-time RT-PCRs available from the commercial company
LSI. All results were confirmed on a 2nd blood sample from the same animal.

Attempts to isolate BTV from both blood samples by 2 passages in
embryonated chicken eggs were unsuccessful. The serum sample from the
animal was tested in a serum neutralisation test (SNT) against serotypes 1,
6, and 8. The following neutralising titres were seen: BTV-1: 1:120; BTV-6:
1:20; BTV-8: less than 1:20 (negative).

Because of the conflicting result between the SNT and the combined
group-specific and serotype-specific real-time RT-PCRs used, the inability
to isolate the virus and the fact that this was the only animal on the
whole farm with this group/serotype specific real-time RT-PCR profile, the
blood and serum samples of the animal were sent to the European Community
Reference Laboratory (CRL) for Bluetongue at Pirbright, UK.

On receipt of the Belgian cattle-blood sample, by the CRL at IAH [Institute
for Animal Health] Pirbright, it was confirmed that the RNA extracted from
the blood contained BTV sequences, using a group-specific real-time RT-PCR
targeting genome segment 1 (Shaw et al, 2007) (Ct 32). However, further
testing of the extracted RNA, using prototype serotype-specific real-time
RT-PCR assays, targeting genome segment 2 of the known European BTV types
(types 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 16), proved negative.

Subsequent assays were carried out using conventional (gel-based) RT-PCR
primers for all 25 BTV serotypes [see comment. - Mod.AS] targeting genome
segment 2 (which controls BTV serotype). Only 2 primer sets (both specific
for BTV type 11) gave bands of the expected size. To confirm these results,
we also tested a 2nd extraction of the blood sample with 2 more primer sets
targeting Seg-2 of BTV-11, and in each case obtained further weak but
positive bands of the expected size. The cDNAs generated were sequenced and
the sequence data from all 4 products (4 primer pairs: although variable
amplifications) were assembled to give a contiguous sequence of 1550 bp
(705-2255 bp). We compared these data to the reference strain of BTV-11,
and they are close but not identical (4 base changes in 1550-99.74 per cent
identity), but only around 84 per cent similar to BTV-11 strains from the
USA. A Zimbabwe strain of BTV-11 gave an intermediate level of similarity
in Seg-2.

The changes between the sequence obtained from the Belgian blood sample and
the South African reference strain of BTV-11 (RSArrrr/11-Seg-2 sequence
accession number AJ585132) are shown below

Nucleotide position / Reference strain / Belgium sample
874 / G / A
973 / A / G
1579 / C / A
1705 / T / A

It is important to note that the nucleotide sequence of any of the genome
segments of the South African vaccine strain of BTV-11 is not generally
available, but as previously reported for the Netherlands isolate of BTV-6
and the BTV-6 vaccine strain, we would expect it to also be closely related
to the reference strain from which it was derived (See: ProMED-mail archive
no. 20081031.3431).

Attempts to isolate BTV from the blood sample by multiple passage in
embryonated hens eggs and/or KC cells were unsuccessful. Therefore no more
RNA was available to sequence the other genome segments of the virus.
However, sera from the animal were tested in a serum neutralisation test
(SNT) against serotypes 1, 6, 8, and 11.

Although no neutralising antibodies were detected in the sample against BTV
1, 6, or 8, a neutralising titre of 1/320 was seen against BTV-11. This
indicates that a high titre of BTV-11 neutralising antibodies were present
in the sample.

The result of the SNT along with the serotyping and sequencing strongly
indicates that this animal had previously been infected with BTV-11.

[The authoritative information above, from the British and Belgian teams,
is highly appreciated.

While from administrative, official, legal, and bureaucratic aspects the
detection of a single BTV-11 positive animal does not give rise to an
obligation to officially notify the OIE (World Organization for Animal
Health) on a "new strain of a listed disease", it deserves serious attention.

As disclosed in the submission above, this cow (selected for testing
because it gave early birth to a calf that died soon after delivery?) was
found to be the only animal on the whole farm with this group/serotype
specific real-time RT-PCR profile. Such a one-off shot is rather enigmatic.
Additional information on this cattle holding regarding its vaccination and
disease history, origin of cows etc would be of interest.

Belgium submitted its last presentation to EU's Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) on 8 Jan 2009; this presentation did
not include information on BTV-11. During the last SCFCAH meeting, 3-4 Feb
2009, Belgium did not submit a bluetongue presentation (which was submitted
by Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the
Netherlands; see at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations_en.htm#34022009>).
It is to be hoped that Belgium will address the BTV-11 case during the next
meeting, probably early in March (2009).

BTV-11 is the 3rd BTV strain detected in the lowlands (Netherlands/Belgium)
since 2006 without their previous known presence on European soil and of
which the routes of introduction(s) have not been elucidated. These include
now BTV-8, BTV-6, and BTV-11. A 4th, novel orbivirus ("Toggenburg") has
been detected in Switzerland in 2008. The Toggenburg virus was included as
BTV-25 in the assays described above, which were carried out using
conventional (gel-based) RT-PCR primers for all 25 BTV serotypes targeting
genome segment 2 (which controls BTV serotype).

As kindly clarified by Prof Mertens upon our query, this virus "is closer
to the BTV sequence than to EHDV [epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus] in
all of the genome segments sequenced", and "has been recognised as a
'putative' BTV-25. Conclusive proof of it as a BTV will requires a
demonstration that it can reassort genome segments with other BTV strains,
and since it refuses to grow in cell culture, that is difficult to do." IAH
scientists have developed typing assays for Seg-2 of 'type-25' that can
detect and identify it. These tests are currently included for full
identification of serotype for novel BTV isolates. - Mod.AS

The evidence for detection of BTV-11 specific genomic RNA is sound and
thorough. The detection of BTV-11 specific neutralising antibody separately
confirms the presence of BTV-11 in the blood of the Belgian cow.

The absence of complete identity of the fragment of genome segment 2
sequenced with corresponding fragments of an American and a South African
isolate of BTV-11 leaves open the question of the origin of the Belgian
virus. - Mod.CP]
