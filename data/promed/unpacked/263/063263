According to the Wyoming Game and Fish, birds in Wyoming are again testing positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza. After a hiatus from confirming any bird deaths from HPAI over the summer, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wildlife Health Laboratory in Laramie confirmed positives in a blue-winged teal and a great horned owl this month [September 2022].

"With bird hunting seasons either ongoing or rapidly approaching, and as migrating birds start to head south, we are asking the public to keep an eye out for dead birds and be aware of the disease," said Jessica Jennings-Gaines, Game and Fish wildlife disease specialist.

Game and Fish is continuing surveillance of HPAI, and it now has an online reporting tool that should help the public get reports directly to the lab. The lab asks the public to follow these criteria when reporting birds suspicious for HPAI infection:

- Any sage grouse, raptor, or owl found dead or eofbiting neurologic signs.
- Only small birds such as songbirds, sparrows, starlings, pigeons, etc., where a group of 5 or more have been found dead or exhibiting neurologic signs. The birds need to be exhibiting signs within a short period -- 3-4 days of symptoms would be notable.
- Any suspected birds in counties or species where HPAI has not been documented since [1 Sep 2022] Check the online map to confirm.
- If there is a concern of HPAI exposure to a member of the public, and they are requesting avian influenza virus testing.

Wyoming hadn't verified an HPAI case since [9 Jun 2022], testing 25 samples over the summer months that all came back negative. In August [2022] HPAI was detected in wild birds in 13 states, including Colorado and Utah.

[2] Canada (Ontario): swan

Three of Stratford, Ontario's mute swans have died since Saturday [17 Sep 2022] of avian influenza (H5N1).

It is suspected that the adult birds died after contracting the bird flu from migrating ducks visiting the area around Lake Victoria and the Avon River.

"Avian flu is back in the area," explains Quin Malott, Stratford's Parks, Forestry, and Cemetery manager. "This is the most likely cause of what's happening to these birds."

The behaviour of some visitors to the waterfront is putting more swans at risk.

Feeding waterfowl along the water encourages the swans to mingle with contagious ducks and geese -- easily passing the deadly virus between species.

"To protect the rest of our birds, let's quit feeding the birds along the river," urges Malott.

Professor Shayan Sharif from the University of Guelph says the risk that a human may contract H5N1 influenza is low -- but viruses can mutate.

"In general for poultry and birds it is highly contagious, but not for humans. Not at least at this point in time," he tells CTV News London.

The swans are not wild. During the winter they are housed in a special facility by the municipality, but the presence of avian flu in the area may change how they are cared for this year.

"This winter maybe we'll feed them inside, locked in, and then once they are done eating we'll let them out, just so the ducks can't get in there," says Sharif.

Avian flu has been carried by migratory birds to most Canadian provinces in recent years.

Malott says his team has a bond with the swans and doesn't want to see people feeding them in the park lead to more deaths.

"We can't do a lot, but let's do what we can. This is a loss for us. Staff and myself aren't taking this well," he adds.

Anyone who discovers a sick, injured, or deceased swan is asked to contact 519-271-0250 ext. 246.

Meanwhile, in Owen Sound, city staff noticed a bird in the sanctuary at Harrison Park showing signs of possible avian influenza which has now been confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

The Eurasian H5N1 influenza, first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America, spread rapidly across the continent. After the number of cases declined since June 2022, they seem to be bouncing back. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses.

Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. - Mod.PMB]
