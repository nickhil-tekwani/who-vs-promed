A total of 37 people in East China's Jiangsu Province have been diagnosed with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) this year [2020], a disease caused by the novel bunyavirus which is spread by ticks. Experts have warned that the virus can be transmitted from person to person.

Based on previous cases, the virus can be transmitted from infected animals or people to others via blood, respiratory tract and wounds, Sheng Jifang, an expert on the novel bunyavirus and director of the infectious disease department with the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, told the Global Times on Wednesday [5 Aug 2020].

Sheng mentioned that a patient, who was infected with the novel bunyavirus 3 years ago [2017] and died later, had infected 16 people that had contact with the patient's dead body, as the patient had bleeding because of severe infection. One of the infected people later died.

Therefore, medical staff and family members of patients should take necessary preventive and protective measures, Sheng said. She also suggested people should not go into the jungle or bushes. "Fortunately, ticks can't fly. It should be safe just to avoid their territory," Sheng said. [Ticks can't fly, but the birds that they feed on can and transport them. - Corr.SB]

Ticks, from larvae to adults, feed on the blood of warm-blooded animals, according to Sheng. Novel bunyavirus infections increase significantly in summer when the ticks breed actively. Therefore, the tick-borne virus could possibly cause a local epidemic.

Sheng said the novel bunyavirus, which was first discovered in 2009 in Central China's Henan and East China's Anhui provinces has a fatality rate of 1% to 5%, and older people are more likely to get sick and die. There is no vaccine or specific medicine targeting the infection, so people need to get treatment as soon as possible once they are infected with the virus.

"The early symptoms are fatigue and fever; sometimes there will be a rash," Sheng said.

The clinical manifestations of SFTS mainly include fever, lower quantities of platelets and white blood cells, and multiorgan dysfunction. Patients with mild cases of this disease can mostly heal themselves, but patients with severe cases often suffer from multiorgan dysfunction or even multiorgan failure.

Ticks are mainly found in mountainous regions, as well as areas where there are wild animals, Leng Peien, director of the vector control division with Shanghai's Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the Global Times. Some wetlands and forest parks in the city are also habitats for ticks.

So far, the novel bunyavirus infections that have been discovered are mainly caused by tick bites, Leng said.

Ticks can carry many disease-causing viruses [and bacteria], such as Lyme disease [caused by a bacterium] and tsutsugamushi disease [also called scrub typhus, which is bacterial and caused by _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ and transmitted by chiggers (larval mites), not ticks. - Mod.TY], Sheng said. The insect is frequently seen in northeastern and southern regions of China.

Lu'an in East China's Anhui Province confirmed on 11 Jul [2020] that the tick-borne infectious disease SFTS has caused 5 deaths and hospitalized 23 people in Jinzhai county of the city since April [2020]. Qingdao in East China's Shandong Province also reported 4 deaths, according to a media report in July [2020].

The new bunyavirus has infected at least 37 individuals in Jiangsu, and it seems to be at risk of spreading from person to person. Main symptoms are high fever, cough fatigue, and thrombocytopenia. The so-called "new bunyavirus" is not a new virus strain that has just been discovered. It was isolated already in 2011 and defined as belonging to _Bunyaviridae_ and the _Phlebovirus_ genus.

The recent patient reported by media suffered from severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS): Clinical manifestations of SFTS are nonspecific and include mainly fever, peripheral blood thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and gastrointestinal discomfort. In severe cases, multiple organ failure may occur. This has been described in this latest patient. For this reason, the involved hospital (Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital) has organized multidisciplinary consultations involving the Emergency Medicine Center, the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the Department of Infectious Diseases, and the ICU. It was finally agreed that the patient was infected with "new bunyavirus" and had "secondary inflammatory factors."

Health authority representatives recently said in radio/TV local interviews that "usually, tick bites can cause skin inflammatory allergic reactions, which can be cured by correct treatment and symptomatic treatment; however, as ticks are also vectors of many pathogens, they cause infectious diseases."

The question is, can the new bunyavirus spread from person to person? The Ministry of Health's (MoH) "Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Prevention Guide" (2010) mentions that during the acute stage patients may be contagious (1).

During 2012, a person in Shandong (China) died of the new bunyavirus and 5 more people were infected; these included one ICU doctor, one consulting doctor, 2 sons of the patient, and one instrument staff in the funeral home (2).

The 2010 MoH document states that case management should be strengthened to reduce the risk of transmission. Under normal circumstances, there is no need to isolate the patient: Blood, secretions, excrement, contaminated environment and objects of the patient can be disinfected by high temperature, high pressure, and chlorine-containing disinfectants. However, in case of critical patients, for example, patients bleeding (e.g., hemoptysis, hematemesis), the medical staff and other personnel should strengthen personal protection and avoid direct contact with the patient.

The new bunyavirus is mainly transmitted via ticks that are active in China in the affected areas (hills, forests, bushes, open pastures, grasslands, mountains, etc.) between April and October. Health authorities have reminded the population to avoid sitting and lying in grass, woods and other places for a long time and when visiting these areas to wear long-sleeved clothes, no sandals, tie trouser legs tucked into socks and wear light-colored clothes. Parents should make sure their children do not play in wild grass/bushes. In case a person is bitten, they should go to the closest hospital to remove the tick in time. Do not remove it yourself. In case of symptoms after being bitten by a tick, the person should seek medical care as soon as possible and avoid close contact with others. Pets may also be affected: After returning home from a visit in such areas, people should check them for ticks.

As noted in earlier ProMED posts, SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious with case fatality rates reported to range from 1%-50%, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus. Nevertheless, the virus is doubtless endemic in China and other countries in Asia.

An earlier report from China reported a case of a subclinical, secondary infection that was most likely caused by person-to-person transmission of the virus from an infected family member with a fatal case of SFTS (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia syndrome - China, South Korea 20140705.2589725). The investigators found an overall SFTSV seroprevalence of 7.2% among 986 healthy persons who reported no symptoms associated with SFTS in Zhejiang Province, China. Because the seropositive participants in that study did not have contact with persons with diagnosed cases of SFTS, their infections most likely occurred through natural exposure. From this, it was concluded that SFTSV infections are widespread in rural areas of Zhejiang Province, and only a small percentage of the infections result in clinical disease.

The longhorn tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) is the virus vector. There is no vaccine, and avoidance of tick bites is the only currently available preventive measure.
