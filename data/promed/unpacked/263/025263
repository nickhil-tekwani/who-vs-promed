Following a swift action in response to this possible case, I can confirm that testing has enabled me to fully rule out presence of foot and mouth disease (FMD).

[The above notification by the UK's chief veterinary officer comes about 20 hours after an earlier notification, according to which FMD was suspected on a pig farm near Feltwell, Kings Lynn in Norfolk, excluding FMD as the causal pathogen of the suspected lesions.

Reportedly, APHA (the Animal and Plant Health Agency, an executive agency of UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs, DEFRA) is awaiting other lab results by Monday (27 Jun 2022). It has been explained that this was due to the need to accomplish additional tests to identify or exclude other pathogens that may have caused the lesions raising the FMD suspicion, such as vesicular stomatitis (VS) and swine vesicular disease (SVD).

UK's CVO, her staff and the team engaged in FMD diagnosis at the World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (WRLFMD) at the Pirbright Institute deserve to be congratulated for their swift action leading to a rapid resolution of the event. - Mod.AS
