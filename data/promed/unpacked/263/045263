Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 10 and 13 Oct 2015, the National IHR [International Health Regulations] Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. The 4 cases are from the same compound in Riyadh city.

Details of the cases
1- A 26-year-old, non-national female developed symptoms on 1 Oct 2015 and, on 8 Oct 2015, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 9 Oct 2015. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing.

2- A 27-year-old, non-national female developed symptoms on 1 Oct 2015 and, on 10 Oct 2015, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 11 Oct 2015. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient is a household contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case (see above -- case no. 1). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

3- A 26-year-old, non-national female developed symptoms on 7 Oct 2015 and, on 11 Oct 2015, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 12 Oct 2015. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient is a household contact of 2 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases (see above -- case no. 1, 2). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

4- A 26-year-old, non-national female developed symptoms on 10 Oct 2015 and, on 11 Oct 2015, was admitted to hospital. The patient, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on 12 Oct 2015. Currently, she is in stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. The patient lives in the same area as 3 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases (see above -- case no. 1, 2, 3). She has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms.

Contact tracing of household and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia also notified WHO of the death of 3 MERS-CoV cases that were reported in previous DONs on 27 Sep 2015 (case no. 13), on 17 Sep 2015 (case no. 9), and on 2 Sep 2015 (case no. 1).

Globally, since Sep 2012, WHO has been notified of 1599 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 574 related deaths.

WHO advice
Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS‚ÄêCoV infection. Therefore, these people should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to.

Food hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.

WHO remains vigilant and is monitoring the situation. Given the lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission in the community, WHO does not recommend travel or trade restrictions with regard to this event. Raising awareness about MERS-CoV among travellers to and from affected countries is good public health practice.

Public health authorities in host countries preparing for mass gatherings should ensure that all recommendations and guidance issued by WHO with respect to MERS-CoV have been appropriately taken into consideration and made accessible to all concerned officials. Public health authorities should plan for surge capacity to ensure that visitors during the mass gathering can be accommodated by health systems.

[This report from WHO gives a little more detail on 4 of the 7 MERS cases linked to a household of 36 female expat workers living together in a 3-room apartment in Riyadh.
