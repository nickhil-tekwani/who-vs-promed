A manufacturer of sweet preserves is in need of additional supply of
ubi tubers [purple yam, _Dioscorea alata_] for high quality jam and
puree. The company has been getting its ubi supply from growers in
Northern Luzon, Calabarzon, Palawan, and Mindanao. However, this year
[2010] sees a decrease in production due to the effect of climate
change and the damage brought about by pests and diseases, especially
the fungal disease called yam anthracnose.

For instance, a supplier from Palawan who used to supply the company
around 100 tons of ubi a year was unable deliver in 2009 because his
plantation was affected by diseases and would take 2 to 3 years to
recover.

[Anthracnose is one of the most serious diseases of yams, especially
_Dioscorea alata_ and _D. rotundata_, and is a limiting factor for
production of these crops worldwide. It is caused by the fungus
_Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _Colletotrichum gloeosporioides_).
_Colletotrichum truncatum_ may also be present in infected tissue, but
its role in anthracnose etiology remains unclear. The disease affects
leaves, vines, and tubers. Symptoms include rapidly expanding
brown/black lesions, necrosis, defoliation, and dieback of the entire
plant, orange-brown tuber rots, and small blisters on the tuber
surface. Reduced photosynthesis leads to undersized yams.

The fungus is spread mainly by infected plant material, seed tubers,
mechanical means, and splashing rain. It has a long saprophytic
survival ability on crop residues. Disease management includes use of
clean planting material, cultural techniques (including crop rotation
or fallow periods between yam crops), and resistant varieties.
Fungicides can delay the onset of epidemics but usually cannot prevent
their development during the rainy season.

_G. cingulata_ and related species have been reported to cause
anthracnose-like symptoms on many crops.
