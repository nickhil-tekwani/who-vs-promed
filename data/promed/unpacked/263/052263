During an inquiry by Wrexham County Council, it was revealed that four
livestock inspectors have been suspended following allegations of
documentary discrepancies at an incineration plant, the Cluttons company,
used to dispose of BSE-infected cattle. The article reported that the four
staff were suspended by the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC), which
oversees the destruction procedure, and will remain off work until the
outcome of the County Council inquiry and another investigation by the MLC.
The inquiries focus on concerns about the number of carcasses actually
destroyed, compared with the number the plant was supposed to process under
planning regulations. Forms used by MLC employees as part of internal
procedures were examined and appeared to show fewer carcasses destroyed than
the number arriving at the plant.
MLC director general Colin Maclean sought to reassure the public that the
discrepancies did not mean that suspect cattle had escaped incineration and
might be in the food chain.
Mr Maclean said, "The allegation is that there have been paperwork
discrepancies. This is something I will not tolerate and is the reason I
suspended four people immediately this matter came to my attention. These
relate to internal MLC documents. The protection of public safety depends on
the official control system, not the internal MLC documents. The total
number of carcasses recorded in the official papers controlling the
incinerator are accurate and reflect the true numbers incinerated."
According to Channel 4 News, the discrepancies left 1,600 cattle unaccounted
for, of which 400 were infected with BSE. Malcolm King, leader of Wrexham
County Council, said his authority's investigations suggested that Cluttons
had claimed to have received for destruction more cattle than had, in fact,
been incinerated. "What we found in seizing those records from the Meat and
Livestock Commission was that ... there are significantly more claims than
there are records for cows being incinerated. We can speculate upon where
those cows have disappeared to, my bet is that a large number have been
incinerated, as they are claiming."
However, he warned that if that was the case then the incinerators were
operating at above capacity, which represented a pollution hazard. Mr.
Maclean said he was taking the matter "very, very seriously."
But he was satisfied that all the carcasses which went into the plant had
been destroyed. The formal documentation system controlling the destruction
process was "absolutely foolproof," he insisted. "Those papers show that all
the animals, all the carcasses going into Cluttons plants have actually been
properly incinerated and disposed of. That system is impossible or extremely
difficult to by-pass without immense collusion. I can assure you there's
nothing here that causes any risk whatsoever to the general public."
