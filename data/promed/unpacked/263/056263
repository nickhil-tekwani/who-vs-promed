[With the death today (Sat 28 Apr 2007) of a 48-year-old man from
Dakshin Kalinagar in Krishnagar (Nadia district, West Bengal) and
member of staff of the Krishnagar municipality, the death toll of the
mysterious disease reached 5]. The victim had also shown symptoms
like fever, severe headache, and vomiting. District officials said
that the victim [belonged to the family] at Tehatta, which lost 3
family members over a span of 15 days after they were afflicted with
the disease.
According to the vice-chairman of the Krishnagar civic body, Mr Ashim
Saha, the victim had recently [gone to the house in Tehatta where his
relatives were suffering from the mysterious disease.]
Meanwhile, the state heath department has decided to send the samples
collected from the affected and victims to the National Institute of
Virology (NIV) in Pune [in the western state of Maharashtra] to
identify the disease. Primarily, samples were sent to School of
Tropical Medicine but as isolation of all viruses is not done there,
samples would be sent to Pune, said senior health department officials.
Dr SN Dutta, Joint Director [public health], said that primarily it
appeared to be a viral infection but the type of virus could be
confirmed only after the samples are examined by NIV, Pune. "There is
nothing to panic. This is not a case of avian flu because no poultry
have died in the area," he said.

As of 29 Apr 2007, 31 people in Nadia are suffering from a mystery
fever suspected to be a new strain of dengue fever virus that has
already killed 3, district authorities said today [30 Apr 2007].
Thirty of them, including 2 who fell ill today [30 Apr 2007], are
from Betai village and one is from Krishnagunj. [The most recent
victims, aged 35 and 40] were admitted to a hospital in Krishnagar.
Their blood samples have been sent to the School of Tropical Medicine
(STM), Calcutta, for tests.
District magistrate, Onkar Singh Meena, quoting a report from the
state health department, today [30 Apr 2007] scaled down the death
toll from the 5 reported yesterday. He said [2 of the victims] had
died of "viral encephalitis" and not dengue. [One of them] died at a
private hospital in Calcutta on Friday [27 Apr 2007] while the other
died at the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata, yesterday [29 Apr 2007].
Tests at the School of Tropical Medicine on 7 patients have revealed
that their fever is [due to] a new strain of dengue, different from
the 3 known types -- classical, haemorrhagic, and shock syndrome.
"Some of the samples will be sent to the National Institute of
Virology, in Pune, to confirm it," a health official said. However,
some uncertainty prevails over the figures cited by the Nadia
authorities in the absence of confirmed test results for all the patients.
[A 40-year-old man], of Pabakhali in Krishnagunj, about 120 km. (75
miles) from Calcutta, caught fever a month ago. He was admitted to
the district hospital. "The doctor can't tell me what he is suffering
from. Only 2 days ago, they had sent the samples to Calcutta and told
me that they are not ruling out anything," said his wife.
We are collecting blood samples of all those who are falling sick and
sending them to the School of Tropical Medicine. All BDO offices
[block development offices] in the district have been alerted. The
health team in Betai has been asked to be ready round the clock. Any
deterioration in the situation has to be reported to the district
headquarters, said Meena.
Since the disease is spread by mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant
water, block offices in the district have been asked to educate
people about the dangers of allowing water to accumulate.

[These outbreaks of undiagnosed presumptive viral disease in the
Bengal region of the Indian sub-continent, embracing adjacent but
non-overlapping regions of India and Bangladesh have some similar
features. The number of victims is small, but the outcome often
fatal. No diagnosis has been confirmed and different vectors (bats
and mosquitoes) have been hypothesized. In both cases samples are
being referred to the National Institute of Virology in Pune with no
positive confirmation of diagnosis from the Calcutta School of
Tropical Medicine. Resolution of the situation by the National
Institute of Virology in Pune (India) is awaited. - Mod.CP
