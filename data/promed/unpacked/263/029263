Ticks May Be Culprits for More Diseases
---------------------------------------
Ticks may spread more diseases than previously thought, California
researchers have found. Ticks carry bacteria that cause disease,
including Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. New evidence
published in this month's Journal of Clinical Microbiology implicates
ticks in other maladies, including cat scratch fever. This infection,
as well as another illness known as "trench fever," are caused by
members of a family of bacteria known as _Bartonella_. "We cannot say
for certain that ticks are the vectors of these diseases, but at the
least we can say they carry Bartonella DNA and could be potential
(transmitters)," said Dr. Bruno Chomel of the University of California
at Davis, one of the study's authors.
Chomel and his colleagues are beginning to suspect ticks in many
diseases where the pathways of transmittal seem fuzzy. One bacterium,
_Bartonella quintana_, caused the "trench fever" World War I troops
caught on the battlefield. In the trenches, lice spread the disease.
But in a recent outbreak in Seattle, Washington, lice were not a
factor, the researchers note.
Another infection, cat scratch disease, raises more questions about
transmission. While generally mild and self-limiting among people with
healthy immunity, the disease can lead to potentially fatal
complications in people with weak immune systems. Scientists had
thought that cat scratch fever, which is caused by _Bartonella
henselae_, was passed to humans from cat bites or scratches, as the
name would suggest. But past research has found that as many as 30% of
human patients infected may not have been bitten or scratched by a
cat, and another study linked the infection to tick bites.
For the current study, Chomel and colleagues set out to determine if
ticks might be a possible channel of Bartonella-related disease. If
Bartonella organisms could be found in ticks before they fed on larger
animals, it would suggest that ticks played an important role in
spreading these illnesses. To help answer this question, Chomel and
colleagues collected hard ticks at 3 sites in Santa Clara County and
extracted DNA from their bodies, hoping to match specific genes to
those of Bartonella bacteria. Of the 151 ticks they examined, the
researchers found nearly 20% carried a Bartonella species, including
those known to cause disease in humans. "That's even higher than for
known tick-borne diseases like _Borrellia burgdorferi_ (the cause of
Lyme disease)," Chomel said in a press release.
The study doesn't provide positive proof that ticks are responsible
for the spread of these diseases in humans, he noted, but it does
suggest that the arthropods are worthy of more investigation.

[This is an interesting and carefully-conducted study that offers an
hypothesis worthy of further testing. I recommend the original article
to interested readers. - Mod.ES
[This shows that some questing adult ticks contain Bartonella
organisms -- but they would contain whatever organisms their hosts
were circulating in their blood, it doesn´t mean they can transmit
them. Chin´s Control of Communicable Diseases Manual 2000 (APHA),
p.88, has the fascinating observation that cat fleas can transmit _B.
henselae_ to other cats but not to humans. - Mod.JW
