The World Assembly of OIE Delegates distributed 17 certificates for official disease status recognition
-------------------------------------------------------------------
OIE's official disease status can be issued for 6 priority diseases and are of major importance to OIE members. Recognized by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as reference standards in the field of animal health, these official statuses reflect the level of transparency and quality of the veterinary services of the country, increase the value of its livestock sector and facilitate access to regional and international markets.

New countries and zones obtained official recognition of their disease status* during the current World Assembly:
Paraguay and Romania were recognized as being "free from CSF" [classical swine fever], as well as a zone in Colombia;
Botswana was recognized as being "free from PPR" [peste des petits ruminants];
Poland was recognized as having a "negligible BSE risk" [bovine spongiform encephalopathy], as well as 2 zones in United Kingdom (Scotland and Northern Ireland);
Brazil and South Africa were granted "free CBPP" [contagious bovine pleuropneumonia] status;
A zone in Botswana was officially recognized as "free from FMD [foot and mouth disease] without vaccination"; Paraguay as well as several zones, one in Chinese Taipei and 5 in Kazakhstan, were recognized as "FMD free with vaccination".

All recognized disease status will soon be available online.

To increase transparency all along the process for disease status recognition, and demonstrate its robustness, the OIE has revised its official procedure and presented it today [Thu 25 May 2017] to member countries.

*Countries can request official OIE recognition of their disease status in regard to the 6 following diseases: bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), foot and mouth disease (FMD), contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), African horse sickness (AHS), peste des petits ruminants (PPR); classical swine fever (CSF).

Official endorsement of national control programs applies to the following diseases: FMD, CBPP and PPR.

[In May 1994, the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE requested the Foot and Mouth Disease and Other Epizootics Commission (re-named later as Scientific Commission for Animal Diseases) to develop a procedure for the official recognition by the OIE of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) free status of member countries. The procedure has since then been expanded to include the official recognition of disease status for African horse sickness (AHS), classical swine fever (CSF), contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) risk status as well as the endorsement of official control programs for CBPP, FMD and PPR.

The official recognition of disease status of member countries is of great significance for international trade and constitutes one of the most important legal links between the OIE and World Trade Organization (WTO), in the framework of the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement), which entered into force in 1995. In 1998, the official agreement between WTO and the OIE further confirmed the OIE's mandate to recognize disease-and pest-free areas based on the SPS Agreement.

FMD being the 1st transboundary animal disease issue selected for the above procedure is not incidental; this virus is extremely infectious and can be spread not only by transported or traded live animals but also by their products, such as meat, dairy products and hides, as well as other commodities, including utensils and animal feed. Bone-in meat has been one of the recognized potential vehicles of FMD in international trade. The FMD virus is also regarded windborne in certain conditions, challenging countries which neighbor infected territories without direct contacts. These well-studied high risks are behind the severe requirements from the Veterinary Services of countries wishing to obtain recognition as being FMD-free. Their infrastructures, available legislation and documented performance, are evaluated prior to recognition. The requirements are particularly demanding when the candidate country borders FMD-endemic countries.

This year [2017], 4 countries have been addressed: Botswana, Paraguay, Chinese Taipei and Kazakhstan. Chinese Taipei is separated by sea from its closest (and infected) neighbor, mainland China, lending this country a comparative advantageous zoo sanitary situation.

The other 3 counties share terrestrial common borders with their neighbor countries. Of these, Paraguay enjoys its geographic situation in South America, where no FMD case has been recorded for 41 months. An evaluation of Paraguay's Veterinary Services (2009) is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Support_to_OIE_Members/docs/pdf/FinalReport-Paraguay.pdf.

Botswana, sharing borders with several infected countries (map at http://tinyurl.com/yd5nkxx2; click on Botswana, zoom in), has developed a system to guarantee sustainable FMD-freedom of the recognized zone. An evaluation of Botswana's veterinary services (2010) is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Support_to_OIE_Members/pdf/FinalReport_Botswana.pdf. The requirements include proper identification of each head of cattle, efficient control upon animal movements, in particular transboundary, and an ongoing surveillance.

Kazakhstan shares borders with several FMD-endemic countries, on its south and east: map at http://tinyurl.com/yd5nkxx2; click on Kazakhstan, zoom in. Kazakhstan has undergone a PVS evaluation, similar to Paraguay and Botswana, but its PVS report is not publicly available on the OIE website. (see "OIE PVS Pathway for effective Veterinary Services; PVS Evaluation missions - State of play as of 15 May 2017" at http://www.oie.int/en/support-to-oie-members/pvs-evaluations/status-of-missions/). Free access to Kazakhstan's PVS report will demonstrate transparency. See also commentary in 20160717.4350687.

An OIE map showing Kazakhstan's 9 provinces recognized in 2015 as FMD-free without vaccination is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/map/A_Kazakhstan.jpg. The map shows also the 5 newly-recognized FMD-free provinces addressed in the current post, namely Kyzylorda, South Kazakhstan, Zhambyl, Almaty and East Kazakhstan. It also presents the names of the neighboring countries. - Mod.AS]
