While he was being transported in an ambulance, an 11-year-old boy died because of the uncontrollable bartonellosis or Carrion's disease that has been affecting the Amazonas region. The deceased boy was from Beirut community, Bongara province [Amazonas region].

The boy's mother revealed that his father had taken him to San Martin region to help with the coffee harvest. It is not yet known if the boy caught the disease in this region or in his birthplace. Apparently he developed gum pain and body aches, but his father did not take him to a health center in order to get appropriate care. Since the patient's condition worsened, his father brought him back to Beirut, where the patient received home remedies and some analgesics. When the boy started having hemorrhages and the mother was unable to feed him, she took him to a health center in Bongara, from where physicians decided to send him to Virgen de Fatima Hospital in Chachapoyas (capital city of Amazonas region). All these occurrences took place over approximately 20 days, during which time the disease worsened. In spite of being cared for in the local hospital, the boy developed uncontrollable hemorrhage and severe pain. As a last resort, healthcare personnel in Chachapoyas decided to move the boy to a more specialized center in Chiclayo (a bigger city in the northern Peruvian coast), but he died as he arrived in Bagua Grande province.

These are the symptoms of bartonellosis: the 1st stage lasts approximately one week and it may be mistaken with any other viral or bacterial condition (acute fever, malaise, headache, and pallor). The microorganism actively replicates in the bloodstream, infecting and destroying red blood cells, so that severe anemia occurs, as well as jaundice. Afterwards, systemic complications supervene, including immune system involvement. At this point, because of immune suppression, the patient may develop another opportunistic condition, which ultimately may lead to death.

[The 2nd phase of the disease is known as the eruptive period or 'Peruvian verruga' or wart, with many red miliary-like lesions on the skin, which may easily bleed. However, this phase is benign most of the times. The causative agent of Carrion's disease is _Bartonella bacilliformis_, a small Gram negative rod, which is transmitted by the bite of a sandfly belonging to the _Lutzomiya_ genus. - Mod.LL]

[A recent publication (Sanchez Clemente N, Ugarte-Gil CA, Solorzano N, et al: _Bartonella bacilliformis_: A systematic review of the literature to guide the research agenda for elimination. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 2012; 6(10): e1819. doi:10.1371/journal.pntd.0001819; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3493376/) underscored how little information is truly well established about the disease. The abstract of the paper ends with:

"Results: A total of 44 studies were considered to be of sufficient quality to be included in the analysis. The majority of these were level 4 or 5 (low quality) evidence and based on small sample sizes. Few studies had been carried out in endemic areas.
Conclusions: Current approaches to the diagnosis and management of Carrion's disease are based on small retrospective or observational studies and expert opinion. Few studies take a public health perspective or examine vector control and prevention. High quality studies performed in endemic areas are required to define optimal diagnostic and treatment strategies."

Included in the publication are the following statements:
- "Evaluations of diagnostics generally provide low quality evidence and are plagued by ill-defined reference standards, inappropriate control groups, frequent failure to disaggregate diagnostic performance in acute and chronic forms of disease, and lack of application of currently accepted STARD [STAndards for the Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy studies] guidelines."
- "There are no published controlled clinical trials of therapy for acute or chronic Carrion's Disease and interpretation of observational data is often complicated by lack of a standardized case definition, lack of an adequate comparator arm, weak outcome definitions and outcome ascertainment."
- "Though it is widely held that _B. bacilliformis_ is transmitted by the bite of an infected sandfly, evidence supporting this belief is remarkably lacking."
