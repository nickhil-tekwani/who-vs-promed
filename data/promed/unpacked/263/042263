Prolonged outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Bovis-morbificans in
Denmark
------------------------------------------
Denmark is witnessing an unusually large number of patients ill from the
otherwise rare _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Bovis-morbificans. The Danish
authorities first noted a rise in the number of Bovis-morbificans patients
in March this year, and 127 cases have been confirmed so far in 2001,
compared with an average of fewer than 10 cases in preceding years. As a
rule of thumb, the authorities assume that the real number of salmonellosis
patients is between 5 and 20 times higher than the number of verified
cases. Symptoms of infection include diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, and
fever, as commonly seen for salmonella infections. The isolated strains are
fully sensitive to all antibiotics tested.
Molecular DNA typing using pulse-field gel-electrophoresis of genomic
restriction enzyme digests (PFGE typing) shows that 85 per cent of the
isolates belong to one major group or a smaller closely related group. The
same PFGE pattern is also found among a small cluster of patients in the
last quarter of 2000, indicating that the problem began almost a year ago.
PFGE typing of strains that have occasionally been isolated as part of the
national quality control and bacteriological surveillance system of food
items in Denmark, as well as of strains isolated in other countries, has so
far not helped pinpoint the source.
Cases have occurred all over Denmark. There is a slight geographical
clustering of cases, but no pronounced clustering of cases with regard to
age or sex. The outbreak appears to be restricted to Denmark, and does not
affect neighboring countries.
Three successive case control investigations conducted in the past 4 months
have not disclosed the source of the outbreak. The reason may be that the
hypotheses tested have been insufficiently specific, or it may be due to
special circumstances regarding the nature of the source. Epidemiological
and microbiological investigations are continuing, involving both central
and local authorities in Denmark.
Any information about the occurrence of _S._ Bovis-morbificans in animals,
food, or human disease, which might be relevant to this outbreak, can be
forwarded to Steen Ethelberg, as listed below. This information was offered
by the Danish Zoonosis Centre, the official body responsible for the
outbreak investigation.
