An anthrax alert has been sounded in Simdega [district, Jharkhand state] following 6 people exhibiting its symptoms today [12 Jun 2015], a death last week and 2 more last month [May 2015] that Ranchi experts confirmed were due to the fatal cattle disease, triggering mega training for grassroots health workers.

Half a dozen people, with anthrax symptoms in Kondigi village of Thethaitangar block in Simdega, were admitted to the block health centre today. Kondigi is barely 25 km [15 miles] away from Basartoli village in Thethaitangar where [ED] died last week. Two more persons died in nearby Kolebira block in May [2015].

People usually get anthrax through cuts and sores on skin while handling infected animals or by consuming their meat, Simdega civil surgeon Dr Benedict Minz said. Inhalation of spores is more uncommon, but not unheard of.

Dr Ramesh Kumar Prasad, director of the state's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), said samples from the body went to RIMS in Bariatu, Ranchi, while that of the carcass of the animal the man had handled went to Institute of Animal Health and Productivity in Kanke. "Due to antibiotics in the body, microbiologists at RIMS could not confirm anthrax strain. But, the vets at Kanke institute confirmed the carcass that caused the deaths last month [May 2015] had anthrax. The symptoms are identical, so it would be reasonable to say this man [ED] also died of the disease," IDSP director Prasad said, citing the urgency to generate awareness about disease and prevention.

"Yes, this means anthrax is constantly spreading and we need to control it immediately," said Dr Benedict Minz, civil surgeon of Simdega.

Prasad added it made a strong case for extensive training of 780 sahiyas ["assistants" to the government health staff] and 38 supervisors or sahiya sathis in the district to generate awareness. "Last week, I'd trained sahiyas of Bano, Kolebira and Thethaitangar blocks. This week, sahiyas in Bolba have been trained. By next week, entire Simdega will be covered. I am personally training sahiyas so that they can play an active role in their respective villages in generating awareness," said Prasad. He added sahiya sathis would be trained next week.

"We are planning to rope in 140 ANMs [auxiliary nurse midwives] and 45 health workers in the district [Simdega] during the training as well so that awareness generation is intense," said Akay Minz, state programme coordinator (sahiya programme) under Jharkhand Rural Health Mission Society.

Wall messages and announcements on loudspeakers have also been planned.

Dr Tunul Hembrom, state nodal officer of IEC wing of National Health Mission, Jharkhand, said: "A newspaper ad[vertisement] released today informs Simdega residents about anthrax and how it spreads. People must stop handling infected carcasses and inform officials on time."

Last year [2014] in October, 9 anthrax deaths were reported in Simdega.

[For a map of India showing Jharkhand state to the immediate west of West Bengal in NE India, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/india_pol01.jpg. Jharkhand was carved out of the southern half of Bihar State in 2000; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand. Bovine outbreaks of anthrax in Bihar were last reported to OIE, Paris, in 2000 and since then there have been no reports in either Bihar or Jharkhand. Maybe the state animal health department did not survive the separation.

At the risk of repeating myself, it has been very clear to onlookers that there is minimal coordination between the public health and veterinary services in many Indian states. And, frankly, the most cost-effective way of dealing with human outbreaks is by preventing the livestock outbreaks from which human exposure follows. And the rural communities would benefit by not losing expensive livestock. The majority of the livestock outbreaks occur in poor rural areas where the villagers depend on these animals both for food and for ploughing and other agricultural activities. To be effective, livestock vaccination for anthrax should be proactive, not reactive. And accurate ecological niche modeling can be done at high accuracy and resolution to define areas at risk of anthrax and where vaccination should have a priority.

And "awareness" is one thing, but livestock vaccination is more cost effective in preventing any human cases of anthrax than any other action. - Mod.MHJ
