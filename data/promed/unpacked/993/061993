["FMD serotype SAT 2/III was detected in a bovine sample collected in the country during September 2017 at Dingonapel, Sehitwa, Ngamiland. The most closely related field strain to this virus was detected in a sample collected from cattle from the same country, BOT/03/2017, with a 100 percent sequence identity." http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/Nov_GMR_2017.pdf

The FMD- SAT 2 outbreak occurred in Ngamiland on 19 Sep 2017 and was associated with contact with wild species. Information provided in the final report sent to the OIE on 19 Mar 2018 (see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=26219), notes that "Intensive surveillance, vaccinations [61 784 cattle were vaccinated in response to this outbreak] and biosecurity measures implemented after the FMD outbreak at Namanyane crush in zone 2d has controlled the disease. No cases were detected since 12 Oct 2017. This zone is an FMD vaccination zone, and this control measure (vaccination) will continue indefinitely. This event is now closed and no further updates will be given."

"Field isolate SAT 2/BOT/1/2017, identified as SAT 2/III/unnamed, obtained good matching results in the VMSD tests employing the following vaccine strains SAT 2 ERI and SAT 2 ZIM." http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/FMD_reports_GMR/Jan_GMR_2018.pdf - Mod.CRD
