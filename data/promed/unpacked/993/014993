[Newcastle disease comes in many forms and its associated mortality
rate can be highly variable. It is caused by an avian paramyxovirus
and can affect all ages. This particular outbreak looks definitely
like a high mortality event and therefore could be a viscertropic
velogenic strain for which the flock had no previous immunity. The
disease occurs almost everywhere, although vaccination often prevents
outbreaks such as this. However, the kind of high mortality
disruptive event seen here is one of the reasons that its economic
impact of Newcastle disease makes it one of the most feared animal
plagues. It is expensive to clean up in developed countries and the
constant losses cause real, persistent losses in the different
production systems of developing countries -- from backyard chickens
to concentrated, high density farms.
