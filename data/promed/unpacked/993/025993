EBOLA - ZAIRE: HISTORICAL
=========================
Source: Dr Dan Fountain, recently retired from Vanga Hospital, Zaire,
speaking at the National Council for International Health, Alexandria,
Virginia (USA) on 10 June 1996
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------
In 1972, a missionary doctor (T.C.) working in nortwestern Zaire performed
an autopsy on a student who had died of hemorrhagic fever. Seven days later
the doctor fell ill, but recovered.
In 1976, after Ebola virus was isolated from the first known outbreak of
Ebola in Zaire, a blood specimen was taken from T.C. and tested positive for
antibody to Ebola, suggesting that the illness he survived 4 years earlier
had been Ebola.
Dr Fountain also mentioned that the installation of a radio-to-satellite
link for the Vanga Hospital was greatly helped by the 1995 Ebola outbreak at
Kikwit, Zaire. The Provincial Governor happened to stop at Vanga on May
1st, and after hearing about how a link to e-mail could help in the campaign
to stop the epidemic, granted an immediate operating licence.
