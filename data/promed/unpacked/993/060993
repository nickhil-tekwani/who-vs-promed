This is further to our repeated complaint of last year during the same
month and same days.
This time again outbreak of the animal disease foot and mouth is
reported in the areas of Nasar Pur, Khushmaqam, and Chamkani in the
districts of Nowshera and Peshawar. If precautionary measures like
proper vaccination are not carried out, we fear this fatal disease
will spread like fire and will drastically affect the cattle sector,
resulting in huge losses to the cattle owners.
The unfortunate aspect of this tragedy is that [there are no proper
arrangements [for providing vaccine to the farmers, and we have no
option but to approach the open market, which is flooded with fake
vaccine of no use to check this fatal disease.

[March is the month when hundreds of thousands of sacrificial cattle
are herded together in Pakistan for a major Muslim festival, and
ProMED reported suspected FMD there in March 2001 (see ref. above).
According to a report from the same newspaper, Pakistan has 21.1
million cattle, 21.4 million buffalo, 23.8 million sheep, and 44.2
million goats. Widespread FMD would severely affect productivity.
The OIE has no reports of FMD from Pakistan in the past 18 months, but
OIE's Handistatus II databank lists 21 outbreaks of FMD with 2251
cases in cattle and 14 outbreaks with 1510 cases in buffalo in the
year 2000 -- not large numbers in relation to the herd sizes quoted.
OIE also notes: "seasonal low sporadic occurrence. Animals are
vaccinated upon request and ring vaccination is realized in case of
outbreak." According to the same table, in 2000, 95 317 cattle and
9702 buffalo were vaccinated:
