The Ugandan Health Ministry said on Friday [16 Aug 2013] that 3 people have died in northern Uganda from a suspected outbreak of a highly infectious hemorrhagic fever. A male farmer is still being treated as a confirmed case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and the 3 other deaths are being investigated, junior health minister Elioda Tumwesigye told a news conference.

Doctors at 1st suspected the farmer had Ebola [hemorrhagic fever], the highly contagious and lethal viral fever, after falling ill on 8 Aug [2013], with sudden headache, bleeding, high fever, joint muscle pain, vomiting, red eyes, back pain, and stomach pain.

Subsequent tests showed it was CCHF. Caused by a tickborne virus, it is highly infectious and is endemic in livestock in Africa. It kills 40 per cent of all the people it infects, according to the Health Ministry. The ministry said it was tracking 6 other people who had come into contact with the sick farmer, being treated at Kalongo Hospital in Agago district, 450 km [280 miles] north of the capital Kampala, and that an isolation facility had been set up.

Uganda has suffered several episodes of Ebola [hemorrhagic fever] and Marburg [hemorrhagic fever] since 2000. The most recent case was in October last year [2012] in Kabale, near the Democratic Republic of Congo, when Marburg virus killed 5 people. The largest outbreak of Ebola [hemorrhagic] fever in the country was in 2000 in the north of the country, which infected 425 people and killed more than half of them. Health services in Uganda are severely underfunded and understaffed with leading referral hospitals lacking basic medical supplies.

The Ministry advised people to avoid close physical contact with animals and suspected infected people.

[CCHF is a zoonotic disease whose usual hosts are wild animals or livestock. It is transmitted to humans though tick bites (usually of the genus _Hyalomma_) or through contact with blood of infected animals during slaughtering or contact with infected fluids of an infected human case.

Following infection via a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1 to 3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. The incubation period following contact with infected blood or tissues is usually 5 to 6 days, with a documented maximum of 13 days.

Cases present with acute fevers, headache, muscle pains, abdominal pains, petechiae [small red or purple spots caused by broken capillaries], jaundice, and other bleeding manifestations. Mortality may be as high as 30 per cent but can be reduced with supportive treatment and administration of ribavirin.

People who live in endemic areas should use personal protective measures which include avoidance of areas where tick vectors are abundant and times when they are active; regular examination of clothing and skin for ticks, and their removal; and use of repellents.
