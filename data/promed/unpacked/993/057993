Local transmission of _P.vivax_ malaria suspected in Florida
--------------------------------------------------
Worldwide, malaria is probably the worst disease a mosquito can inflict on
a human being, but malaria is extraordinarily rare in Florida. There were 2
cases in Palm Beach County reported recently, and 2 more in 1996, also here.
The recent pair of cases in Lake Worth have touched off a massive local
campaign of spraying and warnings to local people, to stay indoors at dawn
and dusk, use DEET-based mosquito repellent if they must venture outside,
and remove any standing water on their property. Some 35 000 households in
a 9-square-mile area will be alerted to beware of mosquitoes.
The warnings have as much to do with panic control as mosquito control, but
they are vivid proof of how serious an illness malaria is.
The 2 recent cases are probably _Plasmodium vivax_ and most likely came
from a mosquito that bit someone coming here from outside the U.S., then
transmitted the parasite. There is no cause for panic, said Gary Goode, a
technician with the Palm Beach County Mosquito Control District.
"That mosquito was probably an _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_. If so, we're
lucky, it's probably dead by now," Goode said. "Mosquitoes don't live
forever. They burn out."
Yellow fever, once the scourge of Florida and the Caribbean, is extremely
deadly but is all but unknown in the U.S. today. Dengue fever, which is
also carried by mosquitoes, can be mild on first attack, but a second
attack can be fatal.
In Florida, the greatest dangers posed by mosquitoes come from 3 viruses:
West Nile, Eastern equine encephalitis, and St. Louis encephalitis. The
fatality rates for Eastern equine encephalitis are 50 to 70 percent,
according to Jonathan F. Day, a medical entomologist at the University of
Florida's Vero Beach laboratory. Therefore EEE, as it is known by its
acronym, probably poses the greatest danger to Floridians, though so far it
is more prevalent in north and central Florida than South Florida.
The fatality rates for West Nile virus and St. Louis encephalitis are much
lower, around 10 percent.

Florida seeks person first infected by malaria
----------------------------------
Health officials knocked on doors Monday seeking a person who they believe
contracted malaria on a trip abroad and passed it via mosquitoes to 2
neighbors.
The 2 men who live 4 houses apart were hospitalized briefly and are
recovering from relatively mild cases of malaria. No other cases of the
disease have been confirmed, and investigators said residents shouldn't be
alarmed.
Still, health workers alerted neighborhood residents to the possible risk
of malaria infection, and mosquito control workers stepped up aerial
spraying and placement in the area.
Health officials were combing the neighborhood trying to find the source of
the malaria, which is rare in the United States but is common in Asia,
Africa, Central and South America, the Mediterranean countries, and islands
in the Pacific and Caribbean. Neither man had traveled to a high-risk area.
"It's not something to be overly concerned about. ... In terms of it
spreading, it's extremely unlikely," said Louise Causer, a medical
epidemiologist with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The agency was helping the local and state health departments in the case.
Most of the 1200 cases of malaria diagnosed in the United States each year
involve people who have traveled to infected areas, Causer said. People can
contract the disease also through tainted blood transfusions, intravenous
needles, and unsanitary tattoo equipment.
The disease can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms. It
can be fatal if left untreated.
Palm Beach County Health Department Director Dr. Jean Malecki said it was
possible that other mosquitoes had bitten the original infected person and
were carrying the malaria parasite, but that officials were hoping
increased spraying would kill any mosquitoes that might potentially spread it.
Previous cases in Palm Beach County were in 1996, when 2 men were infected.
The cause of their infection was never discovered.
Malecki said the second occurrence of malaria in the same place was likely
simply a matter of chance. State Health Secretary Dr. John Agwunobi added
that people may tend to travel overseas from Palm Beach County more often
than some other counties.
Florida residents already have been warned to take precautions against
mosquito bites to protect against West Nile virus and encephalitis.
Agwunobi recommended wearing long pants and sleeves at dusk and dawn when
mosquitoes feed, using repellant, and removing standing water from yards.

[With no international airport within easy reach, the most likely source of
infection is -- as the report states -- a person from a country where _P.
vivax_ is endemic, with some immunity, carrying gametocytes in his blood,
with few or no symptoms. - Mod.EP]
