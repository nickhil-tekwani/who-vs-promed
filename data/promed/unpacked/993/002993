Mandera is on high alert over outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) that has claimed 4 lives in the neighbouring Wajir County.

County Public Health officer, Abukar Abdi Sheikh while speaking to the press on [Tue 19 Jun 2018] said the County government has put intervention measures to curb an outbreak of the killer disease. The measures have been up scaled especially in Kuttullo, Mandera South and Mandera West Sub-counties and also Wajir.

Last [Fri 15 Jun 2018], 5 blood samples were sent to Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) for analysis after a few people showed signs of the disease.

Abukar said there is no cause for alarm but the disease has reached an alert stage prompting his department to launch a public awareness campaign.

The public health department in Mandera is keenly watching movement of livestock across the porous border with Somalia. Abukar said his department is mostly worried of Somalia and Ethiopia, where the health sector is not up to date. "We are keenly observing movement of livestock across the border with Somalia and Ethiopia, as there might be spread of the disease without our knowledge, "said Abukar.

He asked residents to report any cases of people with fluid oozing from their body, yellowness of the eyes and fever.

He said the blood test will check yellow fever, dengue, Rift Valley fever, and Ebola.

Mandera County government has sent 5 human blood samples to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) for testing of a range of diseases. The director of county public health services Abukar Abdi Sheikh cited Rift Valley Fever (RVF), dengue fever and yellow fever among others as the diseases to be tested from the samples send to the agency.

"We are on alert due to high risk of suffering from a range of haemorrhage diseases which are already being reported in the neighbouring county," said Mr. Sheikh.

According to Mr. Sheikh, the blood samples sent to KEMRI last week were taken from patients who complaint of joint pains, had fever and showed signs of bleeding. Results from the research agency based in Nairobi are expected back on [Fri 22 Jun 2018].

Mr. Sheikh said public education has since been rolled out to inform locals on signs and dangers of the deadly RVF affecting Wajir County. Some parts of Mandera West, Kotulo and Elwak are at risk of contracting RVF from Wajir due to livestock migration in search of pasture and water. The public health officer said the porous border with Somalia and Ethiopia is putting Mandera at more risk than the neighbouring counties.

At least 6 people have died from RVF in Wajir since May [2018] when the disease was 1st reported.

RVF is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis, which periodically causes disease outbreaks in humans and livestock and is known to have been endemic in sub-Saharan Africa since 1912.

Patients usually experience fever, generalised weakness, back pain, and dizziness at the onset of the illness and weight loss. In animals, sheep and cattle may have nasal discharge, excess salivation, and loss of appetite, weakness, or diarrhoea.

Mandera authorities are planning to impose a ban on meat and milk following the outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in its neighbouring Wajir County. The administration of the town sent human blood samples to the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi for testing.

The director of county public health services Abukar Abdi Sheikh said the health officials and local authorities agreed to dispatch veterinarians and doctors to check the health of animals slaughtered at the butcheries. "We are on alert due to high risk of suffering from a range of hemorrhage diseases which are already being reported in the neighbouring county," said Mr. Sheikh.

The veterinary department this week rolled out plans to enhance surveillance, institute ring vaccination, increase public awareness, quarantine livestock, restrict home slaughter and close livestock markets to control the spread of RVF.

The department said prolonged heavy rainfall and increased vegetation in some places in the region had led to increased vector breeding, and urged residents to sleep under treated mosquito nets to avoid infections from the deadly mosquitoes.

Health officials in Mayor town of former Northern Frontier District reported that a total of 14 camels died while 12 camels aborted. Residents in affected areas have been advised to feed only on inspected livestock products including meat, milk and blood.

[Suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) cases have now occurred in a new county, Mandera, adjoining Wajir, the county where cases have been occurring in humans and domestic animals (camels, goats and sheep). The prolonged rains and flooding have provided breeding sites for RFV virus vector mosquitoes. The restriction of animal movements, quarantine and ring vaccination may be helpful in halting spread of the virus but will have no effect on the vector mosquito population. As Mod.AS pointed out in comments in the previous post, FAO's updated RVF manual (2018, at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf) states : "Mass vaccination in the face of an outbreak has never been successfully applied" but targeted vaccination may be helpful. In massive vaccination efforts, the vaccination process itself during an outbreak can spread the virus from one viremic animal to another susceptible one. The laboratory test results from KEMRI for the human suspected cases are awaited with interest. - Mod.TY
