A Virginia woman may lose her finger after contracting a flesh-eating bacterium, _Vibrio vulnificus_, while swimming in a river. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that the 61 year old took her grandchildren swimming in the Rappahannock River, a day after her cat had scratched her finger.

Durvin says on Mon 24 Jul 2017, she was in the hospital with a swollen, throbbing hand. She says doctors diagnosed her with a vibrio infection. She says by Wed 26 Jul 2017, her middle finger turned "black and cold". If antibacterials don't work, the finger may need to be amputated.

The Virginia Department of Health says that to avoid contracting vibrio, people with open wounds or compromised immune systems shouldn't swim in salt or brackish water. Infections can also result from eating raw or undercooked seafood, particularly shellfish.

[This post does not report if the woman had risk factors for more severe disease due to this organism. A 2015 ProMED-mail post (Vibrio vulnificus - USA (02): (VA) fatality 20150806.3562336) reported a case of _V. vulnificus_ acquired from the same Virginia river.

The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book", Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc, followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 per cent). Over 70 per cent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm salt water (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by global warming or an isolated substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
