Bird flu [avian influenza] has been detected at 3 places in Kathmandu again, according to the Department of Livestock Services.

The presence of bird flu (H5N8) was confirmed after samples collected from Turkey farms located at Kirtipur wards 4 and 9 and Chandragiri Municipality-2 [Bagmati province] showed positive reports.

All bodies concerned at the provincial, local level working in the field of livestock services were mobilized to destroy fowls including birds and chickens that can transmit the infection.

A total of 535 turkeys, 592 chickens, 76 quails, 20 ducks, 178 eggs, and 900 kilograms [1984 lbs] of poultry feed were disposed of to prevent the transmission of the disease in livestock.

The department has urged poultry farmers to adopt precautionary measures to stop the further spread of the infection and come into contact if they have any problems with their poultry.

Prior to this, bird flu was detected in Tarkeshwar of Kathmandu and Nakkhu of Lalitpur [Bagmati].

[Nepal reported to the OIE on 30 Jan 2021 its 1st HPAI outbreak in 2021, identifying the causative agent as HPAI H5N8 (20210202.8156270).

HPAI strains, in particular H5N8, have been spreading throughout Eurasia, from the British Isles to Japan, since the fall of 2020, affecting backyard holdings as well as commercial poultry farms.

Eurasia has been experiencing extreme cold weather (frost and snowfall) since the late fall months of 2020. This may have triggered winter movements of migratory birds and thereby contributed to the spread of wild bird-transmitted diseases outside the actual migration period (ref: Keller I, Korner-Nievergelt F, Jenni L. Within-winter movements: a common phenomenon in the common pochard _Aythya ferina_. J Ornithol. 2009; 150: 483-494; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10336-008-0367-x.
