--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 10 Jan 2021
Date of confirmation of the event: 13 Jan 2021
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 14 Jan 2021
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N5
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Minxiong Township, Chiayi County, Taiwan
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Jan 2021
Outbreak status: on going
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered-Killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Black Swan (_Cygnus atratus_): Anatidae-Anseriformes / - / 9 / 9 / 4 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Dead _Cygnus atratus_ were found at National Chung Cheng University and were reported to the Local Animal Disease Inspection Authority (LADIA) on [11 Jan 2021].

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The dead _Cygnus atratus_ were sampled by LADIA. These samples were inspected and confirmed by Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI). Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N5 subtype was confirmed on [14 Jan 2021]. On the site where the _Cygnus atratus_ were found has been set a warning sign to alert people. Thorough cleaning and disinfection have been conducted after stamping out operation. No poultry farms are within 1 km [approx. 0.6 mi] radius of this infected region. Surrounding poultry farms within 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi] radius of the infected region are under intensified surveillance twice in 3 months.

Control measures applied: zoning, surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone, surveillance within containment and or the protection zone, stamping out, disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) (National Laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Black Swan / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/ 13 Mar 2021 / Positive
Black Swan / Genotyping / 14 Mar 2021 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[A recent phylogenetic analysis (Lewis et al. Emerg Microb Infect. 2021. https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2021.1872355) suggests that in the recent past H5N8 viruses were being maintained in European poultry whilst additional new variants from unknown sources were being sporadically introduced into other European countries with detection in wild and domestic birds.

The emergence and spread of HPAI H5 viruses across Eurasia since July 2020, including variants H5N1, H5N8 and H5N5, appear to belong to the clade 2.3.4.4b. - Mod.PMB
