Nairobi - Decimation of aquatic life is currently going on in Lake Victoria
waters. The killers are elusive, well-organised and armed with deadly
chemicals and weapons. Kenyan and Uganda authorities are now working
together to contain the use of chemicals to catch fish, which has spread to
Kenyan waters, three months since it was reported in Uganda.
The killings which began at Iganga in Uganda, have spread fast into the
Kenyan waters after the Ugandan authorities ordered its armed forces to
shoot anybody found using chemicals to catch fish. The authorities have
held a series of joint cross-border meetings to work out strategies to
stamp out the problem which was first detected at Iganga in Uganda.
Medical officers in Busia, Kenya, say about 15 people are suspected to have
died after eating poisoned fish. Death is preceded by diarrhoea and
vomiting. Medical officers at Sio Port, Port Victoria, and Mukhobola health
centres said there has been a sharp increase in diarrhoea and vomiting
cases in the area. This has been blamed on consumption of contaminated
fish. Dead fish and other aquatic life have become a common feature on and
around these waters.
According to the Busia District Fisheries Officer, Mr. James Maina, the
gangs are using chemicals that kill even crocodiles in the lake. The
government chemist has not determined what the chemicals are. Mr. Maina
says the chemicals were smuggled into the country from Uganda and sold to
fishermen in Busia, Siaya, Homa Bay and Kisumu districts. "Because of the
seriousness of the matter, the provincial administration has taken over and
there is nothing much we can tell," he said.
Investigations by the Nation revealed that the fishermen were colluding
with their Ugandan counterparts to get the chemicals into the country and
sell them at Sh900 per tot, which can destroy aquatic life within a five
kilometre radius. Sources in Tororo and Jinja said the chemicals were
initially imported by the government to fight the water hyacinth but had
proved disastrous on the fish and other aquatic life. Their use was stopped
and the government ordered them destroyed. That was when they found their
way into the hands of fishermen and mongers out to make a fast kill.
The ruthless fishermen have not spared human life either. At least six
people have been reported killed, while guarding against fish poisoning.
The fish killers, rammed a powerful motor boat into the vigilantes' canoe
and left them to drown.
Uganda authorities say more than 50 people have died from fish poisoning.
Locals believe that their hospitalised kins were suffering from cholera.
Those using the chemicals are known but members of the public are reluctant
to reveal their identities for fear of reprisals. Said a beach leader,
George Wanjala, in Port-Victoria: "We know the culprits, even those selling
the chemicals, but we fear for our lives, because these men are a law unto
themselves. They will either hunt us down and kill us or raid and burn our
homes."
He said the fish killers begin their work as early as 4 am, pouring the
chemicals into the lake and at 5.30 am begin selling their poisoned catch.
The poisoned fish are unusually tainted with blood oozing from the gills
and eyes. After one hour, the colour changes into a bloated bluish green.
Ugandan authorities have taken a tougher stand on the matter than their
Kenyan counterparts. The Busia District Commissioner, Ezekiel Machogu said
Kenyan security forces were incapacitated by lack of patrol boats. The DC
expressed concern that if, the use of chemicals was publicised it would
have devastating effects on fish exports, especially to the European Union
which lifted a ban on local fish exports two months ago.
Simon Osuna, a spokesman for Ugandan government who is in charge of the
fight against the fish killers said those arrested risked life sentences
and fines. He said Uganda had established that four types of chemicals were
being used by the gangs. Osuna denied that the chemicals had initially been
imported to fight the hyacinth by Uganda. He said their investigations
indicated the chemicals were imported and sold by a Kenyan dealer based in
Sio Port. He revealed that more than 200 people had been arrested in the
on-going operation saying they had mobilised the army and police to contain
the problem.
Committees comprising local residents were also involved in the exercise.
Budalangi Member of Parliament, Raphael Wanjala, says the only way the
three countries can effectively deal with the matter was by deploying their
naval forces to the lake.
According to the fisheries department, most of the fish was taken by
refrigerated trucks and sold in Eldoret, Kakamega, Nakuru, Kitale, Mombasa
and Nairobi. The department said the locals did not buy the fish caught
using chemicals as they were able to distinguish them from the rest and
that is why they were being sold out of the area.

[Many thanks to Andrew for bringing this to our attention. If there are any
members out there with direct knowledge of this event, would they please
share their information with us, specifically on which chemicals are being
misused. With the access to refrigerated trucks/lorries these fish can
travel far "out of the area" before they are sold and eaten. - Mod.MHJ]
