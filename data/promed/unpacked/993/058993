An early fall spike in influenza cases has pushed U.S. hospitalization rates for the illness to the highest in a decade for this time of year, U.S. health officials said on Friday [4 Nov 2022], noting that vaccination rates are down.

The rising flu cases come alongside pressure on hospitals from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and COVID cases, officials said, urging people to get vaccinated and offering to assist states that may need additional support.

"There's no doubt we will face some challenges this winter [2022]," U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Dawn O'Connell told reporters, adding that the flu season so far does not seem more severe but has arrived earlier than is typical.

There have been 5 million fewer doses of influenza vaccine administered to U.S. adults so far this year [2022] compared to this time last year [2021], officials said. Flu vaccine uptake is about the same for children this year [2022] but overall is down 6% compared to before the COVID pandemic began in 2020.

About 5% fewer pregnant people have received flu shots so far this season, which officials say is especially worrisome because the vaccine protects both the expecting mother and her baby, officials added.

U.S. flu shots are made by Sanofi SA, GSK and Seqirus, a unit of CSL Ltd.

CDC warns about early spike in respiratory viruses
--------------------------------------------------
At a briefing today [4 Nov 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urged Americans to take steps to protect against a surge in flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other seasonal viruses in the weeks leading up to the holiday season.

With COVID-19 levels expected to rise, the illness activity could place more strain on hospitals, a scenario for which federal officials said they are planning.

Kids hit hardest by respiratory virus rises
-------------------------------------------
Jose Romero, MD, who directs the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said mitigation steps have eased after 2 years of COVID-19 impacts that limited social interactions, and many young children are now being exposed to a host of respiratory viruses for the 1st time. He also warned that COVID-19 hasn't disappeared, with a rate that has now leveled off after decreasing the last few months.

Over the past several weeks, activity involving other viruses has increased, though with notable differences by region. For example, southern states are reporting flu test positivity rates as high as 20%, mostly involving H3N2, a subtype known to cause more severe illness in young children and seniors.

Meanwhile, the Middle Atlantic and Midwestern states are seeing rises in 2009 H1N1 activity.

He said RSV, like flu, is more likely to be serious in younger children and seniors. Virus levels are increasing in all regions except those that include the Southeast and South Central states, areas that were the first to record rises from flu.

Romero said RSV activity is declining in the northwestern region that includes Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.

The CDC today [4 Nov 2022] also issued a Health Alert Network notice to health providers that covered protocols for diagnosis, testing, and prevention.

Federal health officials today [4 Nov 2022] urged people to get vaccinated against flu and COVID to avoid illness and a burden on hospitals, especially with the holidays right around the corner. Given that the different diseases have similar symptoms, Romero urged parents to look for warning signs that children need immediate medical care, including fast or difficult breathing, bluish lips, chest pain, muscle pain, and dehydration.

Flu vaccine uptake numbers are running behind for most groups, except for children.

The officials also recommended other steps, including frequent hand washing, staying home when sick, wearing a well-fitted mask for extra protection, and seeking early access to antiviral treatment for flu.

Dawn O'Connell, JD, Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said officials are tracking hospitalization trends and medical supply chain status. She added that regions currently seeing the biggest impacts are in the Middle Atlantic, New England, and Washington state.

Supplies of personal protective equipment and ventilators are still available. Though hospitals in some states are under pressure, none have requested supplies. "But we stand by ready to help," she said.

Flu markers show steady rise
----------------------------
In its weekly update on flu activity today [4 Nov 2022], the CDC reported another steady rise in indictors, noting that levels are highest in the Southeast and South Central regions, followed by states in the Middle Atlantic and south-central West Coast regions.

The percentage of respiratory specimens that were positive for flu jumped from 6.2% to 9% last week, and the percentage of clinic visits for flulike illness -- which can also reflect impact from other respiratory viruses -- rose to 4.3% last week, keeping it well above the 2.5% national baseline. Eleven states reported very high flu activity, while 8 reported high activity. Most are in the south and southeastern regions.

At public health labs, 66.3% of subtyped influenza A samples were H3N2, and 33.8% were H1N1.

The hospitalization rate last week for this point in the flu season was at the highest level since the 2010-2011 flu season. Levels are highest in seniors and children up to age 4. The CDC reported its 2nd pediatric flu death of the season, which occurred last week and involved H3N2.

COVID decline slows, variant proportions shift further
------------------------------------------------------
In its weekly summary on COVID-19 activity today [4 Nov 2022], the CDC said the decline in COVID cases and hospitalizations has slowed in recent weeks. It said as of 2 Nov 2022, the 7-day average for new daily cases was 39 016, up 4.7% compared to the previous week. Meanwhile, the 7-day average for new hospitalizations declined 1%, while the 7-day average for deaths decreased 3% compared to the week before.

In the CDC's latest variant proportion estimates today [4 Nov 2022], the omicron subvariants BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 combined made up 35.3% of sequences. In CDC region 2, which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 made up an estimated 52% of infections.

Meanwhile, the BA.5 showed another steady drop, declining from 50.8% to 39.2%.

So far, 26.38 million Americans have received the updated bivalent COVID-19 booster, but the CDC said only 49.1% of the eligible population has yet to receive any booster doses.

Increased Respiratory Virus Activity, Especially Among Children, Early in the 2022-2023 Fall and Winter
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory about early, elevated respiratory disease incidence caused by multiple viruses occurring especially among children and placing strain on healthcare systems. Co-circulation of RSV, influenza viruses, SARS-CoV-2, and others, put stress on healthcare systems this fall and winter. As outlined in this HAN, this early increase in disease incidence highlights the importance of optimizing respiratory virus prevention and treatment measures, including prompt vaccination and antiviral treatment.

[Currently, the U.S. is experiencing a surge and co-circulation of respiratory viruses other than SARS-CoV-2. CDC is tracking levels of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and rhinovirus/enterovirus (RV/EV) that are higher than usual for this time of year, especially among children, though RV/EV levels may have plateaued in recent weeks. SARS-CoV-2 also continues to circulate in all U.S. states.

Many respiratory viruses with similar clinical presentations circulate year-round in the United States and at higher levels in fall and winter. In the past 2 years, respiratory disease activity has been dominated by SARS-CoV-2, and seasonal circulation of other respiratory viruses has been atypical or lower than pre-COVID-19 pandemic years. (https://emergency.cdc.gov/han/2022/han00479.asp)

CDC has been tracking early and increasing influenza activity in recent weeks. The highest levels of influenza activity have been found in the southeast and south-central parts of the country. The most common viruses identified to date have been influenza A(H3N2) viruses, with most infections occurring in children and young adults. Cumulative influenza-associated hospitalization rates for children (age 0-4 years and 5-17 years) and all ages combined are notably higher compared to the same time periods during previous seasons since 2010-2011. Although the timing, intensity, and severity of the 2022-2023 influenza season are uncertain, CDC anticipates continued high-level circulation of influenza viruses this fall and winter.

CDC recommends that healthcare providers offer prompt vaccination against influenza and COVID-19 to all eligible people aged 6 months and older who are not up to date. Vaccination can prevent hospitalization and death associated with influenza and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. - Mod.UBA
