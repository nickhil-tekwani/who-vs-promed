[Chicken manure is good, organic, fertilizer. Chemical fertilizers pose
similar problems of runoff and excess leaching into the water table, and
the nutrients are often present at higher concentrations. If we want to
eat, farmers need to spread fertilizer. Let us hope that reason prevails
in this situation. -Mod. ES
In terms of leaching, either runoff or into the water table, 'organic'
manures are typically very much more damaging than 'bag' fertiliser.
However sewage plants may well be the real culprit.
It is in practice not possible to use organic manures (and particularly
chicken manures) on a growing crop and odour problems usually mean
ploughing it in as soon as it is spread. This results in the majority
being spread in autumn through to early spring before planting the next
crop. This results in high levels of nitrates in the soil in a period when
rainfall exceeds plant water use and leaching is thus inevitable. For
'bag' fertilisers the nitrogen is usually applied mid spring so as to match
crop requirements and at a time when plant water use typically exceeds
rainfall and so leaching cannot occur (best practice).
If these blooms are phosphate driven (which seems to be very common) then
one should look to sewage plants rather than agriculture. Most soils
strongly bind phosphate and so phosphate leaching from agriculture is
usually very tiny indeed. Deposition into rivers is almost entirely due to
erosion physically moving soil there. This tends, as I understand it, to
result in excessive water weed (ie plant) growth rather than blooms for
obvious reasons. Heavy rain on land, particularly if sloping, covered with
organic manures (i.e. before ploughing under) can of course result in
significant surface runoff of both nutrients and pathogens directly into
watercourses.
Sewage plants, on the other hand, typically deposit significant amounts of
soluble phosphate (as well as nitrates) directly into rivers and this
becomes very significant in summer when river flows are low because the
nutrient outflow tends to remain constant throughout the year. This
obviously causes an increase in nutrient concentration in the river at a
time (ie mid-late summer) when loss from agriculture is insignificant and
yet when blooms occur. As I understand it the cost of reducing these
nutrients from sewage outflows is very significant but far cheaper than
restricting fertiliser usage over the inevitable wide area, particularly if
this does not solve the problem.

In a ProMED-Mail posting dated 19 Oct 1997, moderator ES made the following
comments:
<[Chicken manure is good, organic, fertilizer. Chemical fertilizers pose
I agree that chicken manure and other animal manures are a good source of
organic fertilizer but only if they have been properly treated or composted
such that any zoonotic pathogens have been inactivated. Use of raw or
inadequately treated manure can be an efficient way to recycle pathogens on
the farms and back into the animals. This is of special concern for _E.
coli O157:H7_ which has proven especially resistant to inactivation. We
need to keep aware of all of the ecosystem impacts of a practice when we
make recommendations on one segment.

All comments are my own and do not necessarily represent the position of
the US Department of Agriculture.
[Thanks to both Oz and Michael McElvaine for sharing their knowledge of the
use of animal manures in agriculture with us. I agree with Oz that the
focus of the _Pfiesteria_ pollution investigation on farm practices that
we have observed to date may be drawing attention away from more likely
sources of the problem. - Mod.ES

[Michael's comment clearly points out a need for information. This just
buttress previous arguments that we lack the data to conclude which factors
have the most significant impact on dangerous algae blooms. We have not
identified all the factors (river depth and flow characteristic, weather,
water usage on farm, grass and other plant "buffers" affecting groundwater
phosphate and nitrogen composition) much less developed good quantitative
estimates of their impact on human and fish health. The argument
concerning which source of fertilizer is to "blame" is only one piece of
the Pfiesteria problem, even if it is one of the more controllable factors
in the multi factorial etiology of Pfiesteria toxicity. Before ineffective
and uneconomical decisions and/or finger pointing become commonplace, we
should at least try to review existing data, find out where the data gaps
are and assess their impact on human infection before developing policy. -
