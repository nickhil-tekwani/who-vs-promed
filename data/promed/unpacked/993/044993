A new study funded by Orkin Pest Control, Atlanta, GA, [has shown that
common house flies carry bacteria that has been linked to meningitis. This
is the first time the bacterium _Acinetobacter baumannii_ has been detected
from flies. For pest professionals who perform fly control services, this
study has significant public health ramifications.
The other newly detected pathogens were _Bacillus pumilus_, which can cause
food poisoning, and _Enterobacter sakazakii_, which can cause urinary
tract, pulmonary, and bloodstream infections. Further research is needed to
determine whether any of the newly found bacteria may be transmitted to
humans from contact with flies or surfaces contaminated by flies.
"We may have found one of the primary sources for the spread of some
organisms in nature," said Dr Jerry Butler, the University of Florida (UF)
entomologist who led the research. "We confirmed that flies spread bacteria
to surfaces, where the pathogens continue to grow. We don't know yet what
the human health implications are, but it reinforces the importance of
sanitation and keeping flies out of food establishments."
The study confirms that flies are much more than a nuisance and that they
pose potentially serious health risks. "Flies are a more serious threat to
food safety than many people think," Butler said. "People need to consider
food safety when they're eating outside. They need to take a different
attitude about a fly crawling across their sandwich."
A white paper on the fly study will be released in December when Butler
will present his findings to members of the Entomological Society of America.

[This article has been truncated. The full text may be viewed at the URL
cited above. Although acinetobacter infections of the central nervous
system are relatively rare and usually nosocomial, community acquired cases
have been reported. The significance of the present findings is thus
unclear. Nosocomial isolates frequently carry multiple antibiotic
resistance markers. It would be of interest to know the antibiotic
susceptibility phenotype of the strains isolated in this study. - Mod.ES
