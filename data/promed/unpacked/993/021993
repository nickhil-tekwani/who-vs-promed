Title: Genomic Signature and Mutation Trend Analysis of Pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 Influenza A Virus

Introduction:
-------------
The causative agent of the 2009 (H1N1) influenza pandemic was proved
to be a novel swine-origin pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus
(H1N1pdm, also referred to as S-OIV). Its hemagglutinin (HA),
nucleoprotein (NP), and nonstructural (NS) protein genes belong to
the classical swine lineage, while its neuraminidase (NA) and matrix
(M) protein genes derive from a Eurasian swine influenza lineage
which entered pigs from avian hosts around 1979, and its polymerase
gene segments, PA, PB1 and PB2, descended from the North American
triple reassortant swine lineage.

This unique genetic combination may contribute to the improved
fitness of the H1N1pdm in humans and its human-to-human
transmissibility, although none of the molecular features previously
shown to confer increased human-to-human transmissibility has so far
been identified in the 2009 H1N1pdm. Since there is a serious concern
that the virus may further mutate into a more dangerous form, it is
critical to monitor the evolutionary trends of the 2009 H1N1pdm virus.

Previously Shih and colleagues developed an entropy-based
computational scheme to identify host-specific genomic signatures of
human and avian influenza viruses. Most recently, they used this
method to compare the protein sequences of the 2009 H1N1pdm strains
collected before 28 May 2009, with those of avian, swine and human
influenza A viruses (IAVs). Among the 47 avian-human signatures, they
found that 8 (one in PB1, one in PB2, 2 in PA and 4 in NP) showed
human-characteristic signatures, which may serve as a molecular
marker for monitoring adaptive mutations in the influenza viruses.

In the present study, we compared the protein sequences of 2009
H1N1pdm strains collected from 1 Apr 2009 to 31 Dec 2009, with the
corresponding protein sequences of the human, avian, and swine IAVs
and those causing past influenza pandemics. We then conducted an
analysis to gain insight into 1) the mutation trend of the residues
at the signature and non-signature positions in the proteins of
H1N1pdm during the pandemic of 2009 and 2) the potential roles of the
mutated residues in human adaptation and virulence of the 2009
H1N1pdm influenza virus.

Abstract and summary:
---------------------
A novel swine-origin pandemic influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus (H1N1pdm,
also referred to as S-OIV) was identified as the causative agent of
the 21st century's 1st influenza pandemic, but molecular features
conferring its ability of human-to-human transmission have not been
identified. Here we compared the protein sequences of 2009 H1N1pdm
strains with those causing other pandemics and the viruses isolated
from humans, swine and avians, and then analyzed the mutation trend
of the residues at the signature and non-signature positions, (i.e.,
those that are species- and non-species-associated), respectively, in
the proteins of H1N1pdm during the pandemic of 2009.

We confirmed that the host-specific genomic signatures of 2009
H1N1pdm, which are mainly swine-like, were highly identical to those
of the 1918 H1N1pdm. During the short period of time when the
pandemic alert level was raised from phase 4 to phase 6, one
signature residue at the position of NP-100 mutated from valine to
isoleucine. A total of 4 non-signature residues, at positions NA-91,
NA-233, HA-206, and NS1-123, also changed during the epidemic in
2009. All these mutant residues, except that at NA-91, are located in
the viral functional domains, suggesting that they may play roles in
the human adaption and virulence of 2009 H1N1pdm.

Our study confirms that the 2009 H1N1pdm virus has much closer
linkage to the 1918 H1N1pdm than any other pandemic influenza
viruses. We identified one dominant mutation at the signature
position (NP-100) and 4 dominant mutations at the non-signature
positions (NA-91, NA-233, HA-206, and NS1-123). Except NA-91, all
these mutant residues are located in the viral functional domains,
suggesting that they may play roles in the human adaption and
virulence of 2009 H1N1pdm.
