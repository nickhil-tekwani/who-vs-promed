Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive, illegal movement of animals

Epidemiological comments: In both provinces, clinical signs first observed by field officers are decreased appetite, hypersalivation, lameness (some to lie down), and fever. Mostly diagnosed as bovine ephemeral fever and treated by providing supportive therapy in the form of analgesics, antipyretics, vitamins, and antibiotics. However, after treatments, clinical signs do not disappear but spread quickly to the surrounding livestock in an average of 1-2 days. Clinical signs then develop with the appearance of vesicles/blisters and/or erosions around the mouth, tongue, gums, nose, rashes, and nipples. Several dead animals were found, and one cattle had a miscarriage in the last trimester. Disease then spread rapidly to other villages in the provinces. Disease investigation has been conducted in both provinces. Although final result still difficult to define the source of infection, however illegal importation of live animals is suspected as the main source of infection. Vaccination will be the main disease control measure. Samples have been sent to OIE reference laboratory to determine the strain of the virus for effective vaccine used. Alert has been broadcasted to all provinces especially those who has history of animal movement from infected provinces (high risk). Increased public awareness and case-finding in high-risk provinces.
