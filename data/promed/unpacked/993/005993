Skin infections from pedicures in South Bay still rising
--------------------------------------------------------
The number of women who have reportedly developed severe skin infections
from pedicures at various Santa Clara County nail salons has more than
doubled over the first 2 weeks of Dec 2004, public health department
spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said today, 16 Dec 2004.

There are now 95 total cases being investigated, up from 40 cases reported
as of 2 Dec 2004. Health officials began receiving reports from local
doctors as early as May 2004 regarding an influx of patients with boils and
skin ulcers on their feet and lower legs, according to Alexiou.

It was determined that the women received pedicures prior to the
infections, which likely stemmed from using a whirlpool foot bath, which
are notorious breeding grounds for bacteria. The infection stems from the
spread of mycobacteria, microbes that can cause painful open sores that
have forced some women in years past to undergo reconstructive surgery to
hide the scars.

Also rising is the number of salons that women had patronized before
noticing the infections, from 3 to 18.

In response to the increasing number of cases, many of the salons have
discontinued the use of the foot spas all together.

"It's not so much the salons but the foot spas," Alexiou said. "Any salon
that uses the spas potentially has a problem."

In 2001, the state cosmetology board adopted new regulations to ensure that
foot spa equipment is properly maintained. Between each customer, the water
from the foot spa must be drained and cleaned with approved disinfectantas
well as soap, according to state cosmetology board spokeswoman Patti Roberts.

Roberts said at the end of each day the foot spa screen, along with any
debris, must be removed before cleaning the basin with soap and
water. Every other week, the basin must be cleaned and soaked with a
bleach solution for at least 6 hours.

However just cleaning the basins likely won't eliminate the
bacteria. According to Roberts, the bacteria may hide in the jets
themselves, and running the spas for at least 10 minutes with an approved
disinfectant is recommended.

Most women are not aware that shaving their legs prior to a pedicure makes
them more susceptible to the infection, according to Roberts. Treatment
for the infection typically requires the use of antibiotics, possibly
taking up to a year for noticeable results.

A 2002 outbreak of the mycobacterial infection occurred in Watsonville with
over 100 cases reported, all of which were traced to the footbaths, Roberts
said.

[Relatively new regulations and publicity to this point does not, to this
point, seem to have made a difference in this outbreak. It is likely that
this type of mycobacteriosis is seen throughout the USA. -Mod. LL]
