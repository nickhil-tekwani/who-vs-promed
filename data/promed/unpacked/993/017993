An outbreak of measles killed 10 people in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region last month [January 2008], Xinhua news agency reported
yesterday [19 Feb 2008], citing the local health bureau. The disease
also sickened 4365 people in January [2008], a jump from 1149 cases
in December [2007], when Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region only 2
people died of the disease, the report said.

with measles. Clinics are encouraging people to get their temperature
