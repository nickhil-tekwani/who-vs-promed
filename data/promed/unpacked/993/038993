- Tue 13 Nov 2018. As outbreak area expands, DRC Ebola total climbs to 339
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/outbreak-area-expands-drc-ebola-total-climbs-339

Over the past week, 3 health zones in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported their 1st confirmed Ebola cases, a worrisome sign that the outbreak is spreading to new areas, the World Health Organization's (WHO's) African regional office said today [13 Nov 2018] in a weekly update.
In other developments, in updates yesterday and today the DRC's health ministry reported 8 new cases along with 4 more deaths from the disease.

Latest cases include 4 in security red zone.
In its daily update yesterday [12 Nov 2018], the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) health ministry said 2 new cases were reported in Beni, and another person from Butembo had died from the disease.

Then in an update today, officials reported 6 more cases, which include 1 in Butembo, 1 in Katwa health zone, and 4 in Kalunguta, which is in a security "red zone" area. Also today, the health ministry reported 3 more Ebola deaths, all in Butembo, the urban outbreak hot spot.

Based on adjustments to the Ebola database, the health ministry said yesterday that Ebola totals have changed slightly and now reflect 3 more probable cases. As of today, the new numbers reflect 339 cases, including 301 confirmed and 38 probable. The fatality count is at 212.

Health officials are investigating 43 suspected Ebola infections.

In yesterday's update, the health ministry said attacks that occurred [Sun 11 Nov 2018] in the Boikene area near Beni temporarily halted Ebola vaccination activities yesterday, but it noted today that immunization has resumed.

Spread to more geographic areas
-------------------------------
WHO's African regional office update focuses on 31 cases and 19 deaths reported since 2 Nov 2018. Over the past week, 3 new health zones have reported confirmed cases. They include a case confirmed on 7 Nov 2018 from Mutwanga health zone near the Uganda border, an illness confirmed on 8 Nov 2018 from Kyondo health zone near Butembo, and an infection confirmed on 9 Nov 2018 from Musienene health zone, an area that had previously recorded a probable case.

Another 2 healthworker infections were reported on 9 Nov 2018, raising the total number of health workers infected in the outbreak to 30, including 3 deaths.

Insecurity and persistent community resistance still pose problems for contact tracing, but as of 10 Nov 2018, the proportion of contacts followed was 94%, said WHO. "The EVD outbreak continues to be of grave concern, particularly with geographical spread of the disease to new areas, as well as the increasing number of confirmed cases and contacts to be followed," WHO said. It added that a plan for strengthening infection prevention and control in Beni and other areas needs to be put in place, along with continued collaboration with Mai Mai groups in Kalunguta, a security "red zone", to help with the investigation of deaths in the community and in hospitals and to follow up with contact vaccination.

Attacks by armed groups in Beni and surrounding areas continue to pose a major security threat, officials said.

Situation update: data as reported by Sun 11 Nov 2018
-----------------------------------------------------
Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners continue to respond to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and remain confident that the outbreak can be contained, despite ongoing challenges. Over the past week (reporting data from 5-11 Nov 2018), we observed the continuation of the outbreak in several areas of North Kivu province, as well as geographical expansion to new areas, including Kyondo (30 km [18.6 mi] south east of Butembo) and Mutwanga (50 km [31 mi] south east of Beni). The initial cases in these areas were exposed through contact with cases in Butembo and Beni, respectively. During this period, 31 new confirmed cases were reported, among which there were 7 newborn babies and infants aged less than 2 years, 3 children aged 2-17 years, 3 women who were pregnant or breastfeeding, and 3 health workers.

Furthermore, this week, a review and reconciliation of case records resulted in the addition of 14 probable cases, invalidation of 11 historic deaths previously reported as probable cases, and exclusion of duplicate case counts. Moreover, some confirmed and probable cases were recategorized to health zones where their infection most likely occurred (as opposed to location of Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) where they were admitted) (table 1: see URL above).

Overall trends in the outbreak (figure 1: see URL above) reflect the continuation of transmission in several cities and villages in North Kivu. Given the persisting delays in case detection and the ongoing data reconciliation activities, trends in weekly incidence (especially in the most recent weeks) must be interpreted cautiously.

[3] Clinical trial launched
Date: Mon 12 Nov 2018
Source: STAT [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/12/a-pivotal-day-in-worlds-response-to-ebola-nears-the-launch-of-a-clinical-trial/


A pivotal day in world's response to Ebola nears: the launch of a clinical trial
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials are preparing to launch a clinical trial designed to test whether experimental Ebola therapies improve patients' chances of survival in the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- a landmark moment in the world's efforts to respond to this and future crises.

The randomized controlled trial will compare 3 different antibody treatments and an antiviral drug to each other, rather than involving a placebo. It is unlikely that the trial will produce clear results based on a single epidemic; it is expected to span several outbreaks and countries -- a novel and challenging design.

In the current outbreak, the trial will be made all the more complicated by a difficult security environment. "I don't think the world quite appreciates the challenge of the environment in which this is happening," said Dr Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust and co-chair of a group that has been working under the auspices of WHO to draft the trial protocol. "People are being shot at, and it's not just the occasional bit of gunfire," Farrar said of the security environment in North Kivu. "There's mortars, there's kidnappings -- it is an intensely fragile environment with a lot of conflict that's been going on for years."

The 4 experimental therapies that will be tested have been used for weeks in Ebola treatment units being operated by nongovernmental organizations Médecins sans Frontières (MSF; Doctors Without Borders) and Alima. Those therapeutics are the Gilead antiviral drug Remdesivir and 3 monoclonal antibody preparations: ZMapp, made by Mapp Biopharmaceuticals, Regeneron's REGN 3470-3471-3479, and mAb 114, which is being developed by the National Institutes of Health and DRC's National Institute of Biomedical Research. As of [Fri 9 Nov 2018], 139 patients had received 1 of the 4. The trial is expected to start soon, likely in November, Farrar said -- with Congo's National Institute of Biomedical Research serving as the sponsor for the trial.

But there remain details to be worked out. An ethics committee advising the Congolese government is still reviewing the protocol. The protocol is written in such a way as to allow countries a little flexibility. While DRC has indicated it will run 4 arms -- meaning all patients will be randomized to receive one of the drugs -- other countries will have the option to add a control arm that would allow the drugs to be compared to standard care.

[Dr Annick Antierens, MSF's medical department strategic adviser] said there's a problem with that idea. There is no one standard of care for Ebola, she said, and none of the interventions used in the treatment of Ebola patients has been proved to actually improve survival. That's not to say they don't help, only that there have never been clinical trials to show they do.

A data safety monitoring board will review results at preset intervals. If any of the drugs don't appear to be working -- or conversely appear to be much more effective than the others -- the board will advise the trial team on whether to drop a drug or discontinue the trial, said [Dr Marie-Pierre Preziosi, one of the leads of a WHO program designed to spur development of medical countermeasures for disease threats that don't attract commercial pharmaceutical manufacturers].

[This clinical trial is difficult to design for a number of reasons, a major one being the unrest in the region, which may interfere with following the patients. In addition, in this study in the middle of an outbreak, a placebo will likely not be given. Thus, there is no control against which to measure results. The antivirals being tested have been in use in the Ebola treatment centers and appear to be helpful, but they have not been tested in the context of a planned clinical trial. Furthermore, a combination of drugs may work best, but it appears only single drugs will be tested against each other. Nonetheless, this is a good opportunity to try to evaluate in a 'compassionate use' clinical study which antiviral works best under which conditions. - Mod.LK

[There is a tremendous variability in severity and time point of the human disease. Some patients may come in already in organ failure. Others only mildly ill. The mildly ill will be apparently easier to treat and may have recovered on their own even without treatment. The severely ill might not recover, no matter what treatment they are given. Thus, with a small number of human cases enrolled in the trial, and that small number further divided into 4 groups, it will be very difficult to get statistical significance.

A main concern is if the patients are truly randomized. If those with mild disease all get treatment A, then treatment A will appear to be better. We must compare those with equivalent disease.

Collection of mortality statistics alone will not be enough. We need data on viral load, health status, time of infection if known, and other factors on each patient entering the trial, and notes on which treatment they received to determine the ability of each treatment to limit disease and confer protection.

We need as much data as possible to know how to proceed the next time there is an outbreak.

It would also be helpful to sequence patients' viruses -- obtaining sequence information from those that survive and those that do not -- to know if any of the treatments mitigate or enhance mutagenic escape.]

- Tue 13 Nov 2018. Congo's Ebola outbreak to last at least 6 more months: WHO
[Reuters, abridged, edited]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-ebola-congo-who/congos-ebola-outbreak-to-last-at-least-six-more-months-who-idUSKCN1NI1ZF

The Ebola outbreak in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which has already killed more than 200 people, is expected to last until mid-2019, a senior WHO official said on [Tue 13 Nov 2018]. "It's very hard to predict time frames in an outbreak as complicated as this with so many variables that are outside our control, but certainly we're planning on at least another 6 months before we can declare this outbreak over," WHO emergency response chief Peter Salama told reporters.

The location of the disease is perhaps the most difficult the WHO has ever encountered, due to a dense and mobile local population, insecurity caused by 2 armed groups, and its spread by transmission in health centers, Salama said. One of the major drivers of the spread of the disease was due to people visiting the several hundred "tradi-modern" health centers in the town of Beni, he said. "Those facilities, we believe, are one of the major drivers of transmission," he said.

The tradi-modern facilities were unregulated, informal, and varied from being a standalone structure to a room in someone's house, and were not set up to spot Ebola, let alone tackle cases of the disease. Many had no running water for handwashing, and patients - who generally opted for injectable medicine because they felt it gave them a stronger form of medicine - would reuse needles. "With the injections come the risks," Salama said.

There had been an epidemiological breakthrough around late October, when a change in the age distribution of Ebola patients revealed that many of them were children being treated for malaria in the tradi-modern health centers.

[6 months is a long time to contain this outbreak and prevent it from spreading to neighboring countries. - Mod.LK]

- Tue 13 Nov 2018. Containing the latest Ebola outbreak
[Harvard Business Review, abridged, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/y8x58qok

Last month [October 2018], a rebel attack in Beni, the epicenter of the ongoing Ebola outbreak near the eastern border of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), once again halted the efforts of response teams working to contain the virus. With over 10 major episodes of violence since the outbreak was declared in August [2018], insecurity and community mistrust has made it difficult to gauge the true extent of Ebola's spread. Though the outbreak could still be limited, cases appear to be increasing -- especially in Beni, where cases have doubled in recent weeks -- with 80% of new infections arising among people with no link to "known transmission chains" (where everyone who is infected is known and you can track who has been exposed with some accuracy). This means that we might only be seeing the tip of an iceberg of hidden transmissions and the outbreak could spiral out of control and spread into neighboring countries. Given this danger, the current strategy for containing the disease needs to be adjusted.

Eastern DRC has been home to one of the deadliest and most intractable conflicts in modern history; over 50 armed groups are still active in the region. Originally formed to protect their communities, many of these rebel militias have become entangled in the messy web of politics, shifting allegiances, and underhanded mining deals that fuel the conflict.

This backdrop and the inability of the government or international agencies to assure basic safety, much less basic needs, has entrenched a distrust of formal institutions in the population. These dynamics have been made more complicated by the fact that DRC is supposed to hold elections in December that have already been delayed twice since 2016. Given that outbreaks can grow quickly and exponentially, definitive action is needed now.

[Contact tracing and ring vaccination have] not been possible this time around: areas affected by violence have been inaccessible for days at a time. Therefore, while contact tracing and ring vaccination should continue where transmissions can be tracked, mass vaccination of larger portions of populations should be considered in areas where that is not possible such as Beni, which has a population of about 230 000. Expanding vaccinations in this manner could immediately halt the spread of the disease.

While such a mass vaccination sounds ambitious, WHO and others have executed much larger national campaigns in over 40 low-income countries, including DRC, where millions of children were immunized against polio or measles within a single week. These campaigns were also implemented successfully during conflicts in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Liberia. Though a mass-vaccination effort targets an entire population, it need only reach the proportion required for "herd immunity" -- immunizing enough people so that the virus cannot spread. Early studies of the Ebola vaccine found that it might be possible to achieve herd immunity by vaccinating as little as 42% of the population.

To be successful, the mass vaccination effort would require the buy-in of the communities and the Ebola response teams being able to securely access the areas in question for the day or two it would take to immunize everyone. Promisingly, a recent study showed that even communities with high levels of distrust appear to be open to vaccination.

Anthropologists are already on the ground working tirelessly to engage community leaders and armed groups. In areas not amenable to outreach, a neutral "white helmet" security force, ideally drawn from the African Union or other countries without past involvement in the DRC conflict, should be deployed with the sole mission of securing vaccination efforts. It should be made abundantly clear to the population that this force has no allegiance to any political or institutional actors and is there only to deter violence against responders. At the end of the day, communities and militias do not want their loved ones to die from Ebola and would respect such a presence if they were reassured its mission is strictly medical.

Mass vaccination will also require an adequate supply of the Ebola vaccine. Its manufacturer, Merck, has committed to maintaining a supply of 300 000 doses at all times. Doing so could become difficult if vaccination efforts are expanded, but at the current juncture, the number of people who would need to be vaccinated in order to stunt the outbreak still appears to be within the range of existing stockpiles. Nonetheless, production of the vaccine should be increased and the bottlenecks to doing so should be assessed and cleared to ensure an adequate supply.

It's true that the Ebola vaccine is still experimental and its health risks are not yet fully known. However, for people living in areas where everyone who is infected is not known, the heightened risk of unknowingly contracting a fatal Ebola infection may, at this point, outweigh the potential danger posed by the vaccine.

After the West African Ebola epidemic spiraled out of control, many wondered why more aggressive measures were not taken sooner. We may be at a similar make-or-break point in this outbreak.

[A study published in 2016 determined the level of herd immunity needed to prevent Ebola virus from spreading. The investigators estimated that "42.2-63.0% of the population would need to be vaccinated in order to prevent transmission and outbreaks. Assuming 80% vaccine efficacy as reported by phase I clinical trials, 52.7-78.7% of the population would require vaccination coverage in order to establish herd immunity. In recent ring vaccination trials which considered the vaccine to be 100% effective after 10 days, 42.2-63.0% of the population would need to be vaccinated." (See Gittings K, Matson KL. Establishing herd immunity against Ebola through vaccination. Vaccine. 34(24): 2644-7; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.04.047)
