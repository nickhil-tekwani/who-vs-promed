The number of people dying from a cholera outbreak has reached 27 in the South Sudanese capital of Juba, with suspected cases more than doubling from 395 cases last week to 892, the UN humanitarian agency OCHA [UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Crisis] said on Sat 31 May 2014.

According to OCHA, South Sudan, living conditions in displacement sites continue to deteriorate due to flooding caused by heavy rains, especially in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile states, Xinhua reported.

"Out of the cholera cases reported, 62 percent are men aged 20-34 years (41 percent)," OCHA said in its latest report. "The case fatality rate of 3 percent is still above emergency thresholds, indicating late presentation of people at health facilities."

Cholera broke out in Juba where 5 months of conflict between the pro-government troops and anti-government forces have left thousands homeless and disrupted food supplies and health services. Aid agencies have warned that the situation is dire and may worsen as the rainy season hits. Hundreds of thousands of people in South Sudan are living in displaced persons camps, which are congested and lack clean water.

[The combination of poor sanitaryfacilities and lack of clean water, internally displaced persons due to civil strife, and heavy rains are at work to cause this expanding _V. cholerae_ epidemic in South Sudan. A case fatality rate of 3 percent reflects poor access to any medical care and the absence of oral rehydration solutions. Although cholera can cause profound watery diarrhea, it is secretory in nature, and absorption of fluids is not affected.
