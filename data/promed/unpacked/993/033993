Were necropsies of dead birds performed in all the affected regions? Was
_Salmonella_ isolated from all cases? Was the strain of _Salmonella_
identified?
Would anyone involved with these cases care to comment?

Songbird mortality has been reported in 15 states and confirmed on bacterial
culture in 12 of them (we received either carcasses and did the diagnostic
work up in our lab or we received lab reports from other diagnostic labs).
Once we confirmed the disease in songbirds from a state, we did not take in
additional birds.
We send our salmonella isolates to the National Veterinary Services Lab in
Ames, Iowa for typing. They identified our isolates as _Salmonella
typhimurium_. This is what is usually found in songbird salmonellosis
mortality. The next question people usually have is whether it's the same
strain as DT104 that we've been hearing about lately. The answer is that at
this point the isolates have not been typed out to that extent. Our Center
microbiologist is pursuing having this work done on our collection of
salmonella isolates from various wildlife species.
I've been checking in with the State biologists that I worked with on this
dieoff to get an update on the status of things. I haven't talked with
everyone yet but basically the biologists have told me that the dieoff seems
to be tapering off. Bottomline is I don't think the mortality is completely
over in all the locations in all 15 states but it does seem to be winding
down.
Below is (updated) information I provided to the Cornell Ornithology Lab and
a public health dept person who'd requested information on the dieoff.

[Edited together into one coherent document. - Mod.MHJ
Salmonellosis has been confirmed as the cause of songbird mortality in the
following states. (We received either carcasses or lab reports from other
diagnostic labs): Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, New
Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Wisconsin, Kentucky and Ohio.

There have been reports of passerine mortality in Connecticut, Maine, &
Massachusetts, [where however, we have not received any carcasses or lab
reports.

We have received reports of passerine mortality at bird feeders in 15
Midwestern and Eastern States. Goldfinches and pine siskins are the primary
species reported in most areas but redpolls (in Vermont, Maine, Michigan and
Wisconsin) and miscellaneous other species have been affected as well.

Salmonellosis has been confirmed as the cause of death in 12 states.
Although salmonellosis in songbirds in very common, a pattern of concurrent
mortality over a large geographic area is not typical for the eastern half
of the country. It is a more common scenario out west where every few years
a die-off of that nature occurs (oftentimes it involves pine siskins). The
last large salmonellosis mortality event in the east was in 1988 in New York
and other New England states.

As you know, the bacteria are shed in the feces. It can be spread
bird-to-bird via direct contact or through ingestion of food or water
contaminated with infected avian or mammalian fecal material. Good bird
feeder maintenance is important anytime but particularly when there are sick
and dead birds present. Cleaning feeders with a 10% bleach and water
solution and raking up waste seed can help decrease the bacterial load.
Storing birdseed in rodent proof containers helps prevent rodent droppings
in the seed.

People often ask if they or their pets might get sick from salmonellosis in
songbirds. I tell them that there are more than 2,000 strains of salmonella
bacteria and many different birds and mammals can be infected although
various strains affect different animals. It is possible that the strain
typically seen in songbirds could cause illness in humans. Practicing good
sanitation should help minimize this risk. I tell them that anytime a person
handles sick or dead animals or fecal material, it is a good idea to wear
rubber gloves and wash their hands well afterwards. Cleaning the feeder in a
bucket would be better than in the kitchen sink. Discourage pets from
feeding on sick and dead birds. I also suggest they check with their
physician or veterinarian if they have additional concerns. I hope this
information is helpful.
