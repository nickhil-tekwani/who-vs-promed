Zika virus in a returning Canadian traveller
--------------------------------------------
Zika virus (ZIKV) has been detected in the blood of a 45 year old Canadian woman who recently returned from a vacation in southern Thailand. ZIKV is a flavivirus which was first reported from Thailand in 1954.

The patient traveled with other family members to Bangkok from 21-28 Jan [2013], and spent a week there without noticing many mosquito bites. The party went to Phuket Island from 28 Jan-2 Feb [2013], traveling and spending time at various beaches where the patient noted many more mosquito bites as she was told that it was mosquito season. On her return to Bangkok, on 2 Feb [2013], she changed her hotel to one by the river, where she sustained numerous bites on her exposed skin. Most noticeably her leg became inflamed and itchy, to which she applied cortisone cream and other emollients. She flew back to Canada 3 days later on 5 Feb [2013] and on the flight described feeling restless, irritable, with a headache, chills, and sore back, in addition to the itching and inflammation of the mosquito bitten areas.

Three days after her return to Alberta, Canada, she felt feverish, was diaphoretic, nauseous with vomiting, extremely fatigued, and noted blisters in her mouth. After a brief respite from her symptoms she developed a severe backache with a papular rash, involving her extremities including her palms, for which she sought medical assistance at a local emergency department. The physician tested her for a variety of infectious etiologies, including dengue fever, malaria and measles, but did not admit her for observation or management.

Initial investigations included hemoglobulin (131 g/L), white blood cell count (4.7 x 109 /L), with a normal differential, but with a low platelet count of 81 x 109 /L (normal range 150-400 x 109 /L). Her creatinine, electrolytes, ALT [alanine aminotransferase], and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Thick and thin blood smears were negative for malaria and other blood parasites. Blood cultures were negative for bacterial pathogens as was the measles RT-PCR performed on her nasopharyngeal swab and urine.

A number of serum samples collected over 30 days were tested for dengue IgM and IgG antibodies. A sample collected on 15 Feb [2013], was negative, whereas a follow-up sample collected 4 days after the 1st specimen gave a positive result in the dengue IgM antibody EIA, although the IgG antibody was negative, consistent with an acute dengue fever infection. However, the lack of a dengue IgG seroconversion on a convalescent serum and the unusual nature of the rash, prompted us to investigate a probable flavivirus etiology through a molecular approach. Reverse-transcriptase PCR using primers targeting a region of the NS5 gene of the _Flavivirus_ genus (Ayers et al, J Virol Met 2006; 135: 235-9), was followed by sequencing. The 780 bp sequence obtained from the amplicon was compared to published sequences in the NCBI nucleotide database and showed a 99 per cent identity (769/780) with the corresponding sequences of ZIKV (Genbank nos. JN860885 and EU545988), thereby establishing the diagnosis of ZIKV infection.

Subsequent serological testing of convalescent sera by the Centers for Disease Control (Ft Collins, Colorado), confirmed the presence of ZIKV specific neutralizing antibodies by a plaque reduction neutralization assay. The reactivity of the serum in the dengue IgM EIA is consistent with previously observed serological cross reactions involving the flaviviruses.

The patient made a relatively uneventful recovery, about two and a half to three weeks after her initial symptoms. None of her immediate family members described overt symptoms, such as fever and rash, although they had stated that they were also bitten by mosquitoes during their stay in Bangkok.

Of interest is that one of her friends, who traveled the entire trip with her, also had a similar non-specific presentation of fever and chills, nausea and joint pain but without the rash, and with a symptom onset one day after the index case. Serology for dengue was negative for both IgM and IgG antibody, and this sample was also negative for ZIKV, using the PCR-based approach described above. [Was the serum tested for antibodies to chikungunya virus, which is also endemic en Thailand? - Mod.TY]

This is the 1st laboratory confirmed case of ZIKV reported in Canada, and serves as a cautionary reminder of the other viral etiologies that should be considered in returning travelers that may be outside the diagnostic capability of many clinical laboratories.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of a Zika virus infection originating in Thailand. The virus was first isolated in 1947 from rhesus monkey serum in Uganda. In 1978 there was a small outbreak of acute fever caused by Zika virus infections. Fortunately, the probability of ongoing transmission from this case in Alberta, Canada is very remote.

The Alberta case is clinically similar to cases seen in the 2007 outbreak on Yap Island. In a 13 Jul 2007 ProMED-mail post (archive no 20070713.2252) on a Zika virus outbreak on Yap Island, Dr Martin Bel noted, "symptoms are mild and generally last for 4-7 days. A probable case is defined as illness in a resident or visitor to Yap State with onset since 15 Mar 2007 and 2 of the 3 following signs or symptoms:

- a maculopapular rash involving the trunk and extremities that is sometimes pruritic;
- conjunctivitis; or
- joint pain, that can affect both large joint and the smaller joints of the hands and feet.

Other symptoms that have been noted in the Yap outbreak include fever, retro-orbital eye pain, headache, myalgias, lower extremity edema, lymphadenopathy, and diarrhea."

ProMED-mail thanks Kevin Fonseca and colleagues for submitting this interesting report. It is another example of the transport of virus infections half way around the world in this age of rapid flights, and the need for clinicians to be able to quickly find out about infections occurring in distant localities.
