RASH DISEASE, PHILIPPINE WORKERS - TAIWAN
=========================================
Date: Saturday, March 1, 1997 11:28:52 MST
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>
(Taipei, Jan. 21)
A six-member Philippine health team, led by Dr. Manuel M. Dayrit, Assistant
Secretary of the Department of Health, visited a Philips Co. factory in
Chubei township, about 60 kilometers south of Taipei, on Tuesday as part of
its efforts to find the cause of a mysterious disease that has plagued some
40 Filipino workers at the plant since last August. Several Republic of China
health officials accompanied the Philippine team on the fact-finding visit.
Chiang Teh-chen, director of Philips Co. manpower resources department, first
briefed the Philippine team on the deployment of Filipino workers at the
plant. The Philippine visitors then toured the plant's monitor, glassware
and ferrite production lines where the ailing Filipinos were working. They
spoke with some Philippine workers about the mysterious disease, whose major
symptoms include itchy skin, high fever and liver malfunction.
Philips executives presented many data which they believe prove that the
working environment at the plant should not have anything to do with the
disease.
Philips, one of the largest foreign-invested companies in Taiwan, began to
recruit Philippine workers in 1994. At present, 945 Filipinos are working at
the company's Chubei and Tapeng plants.
When several newly recruited Philippine workers at the plant's Chubei plant
were found to have contracted the mysterious disease in August 1996, the
first group of workers had already served out their two-year working
contracts and returned to their home country in good health.
As those who suffered from the disease had worked at the plant for less than
a month, Philips executives said they do not think the company's working
conditions could be a cause of the disease.
Shortly after his arrival in Taipei on Monday, Dr. Dayrit cited four general
hypotheses on the cause of the mysterious disease -- drug reaction due to
anti-parasite medication, mycoplasma infection, chemical combination at the
workplace, and genetic predisposition.
A total of 37 Filipinos at Philips plants came down with the disease. One of
them died in Taipei last August and another died in the Philippines early
this month. Ten of them are receiving treatment at Veterans General Hospital
in suburban Taipei, 11 are recuperating in the living quarters of the Chubei
plant, and the remainder have already returned to the Philippines at their
own behest.
The latest Filipino victim, who was diagnosed as infected with the disease on
January 18, arrived at Philips' Chubei plant together with 41 others on
December 16. The patient has never worked on the production line and has
only done some house cleaning work.
Some Philippine workers at other Taiwan companies have also contracted the
mystery disease. Philips Co. has suspended recruitment of Filipinos since
the outbreak of the disease. It has not yet decided whether to recruit
workers from other countries.
The Philippine health team will tour Philips' Tapeng plant in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park, the Taiwan version of America's Silicon
Valley, on Wednesday for similar fact-finding purposes.
