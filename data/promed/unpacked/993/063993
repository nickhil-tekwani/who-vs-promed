The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) says there is currently a hepatitis A outbreak in several northeast Alabama counties. It says since 1 Sep 2018, there have been 26 confirmed cases of hepatitis A in Jackson county, and 19 confirmed cases in DeKalb county. There have been a total of 51 cases throughout the state in that same time frame. As of 16 Apr 2019, the ADPH says there are 22 active cases in Jackson county and 12 cases in DeKalb county. Unlike similar, recent cases in Tennessee and Georgia, the ADPH has not pinpointed an exact location, such as a restaurant, for the source of the outbreak.

In a 23 Mar 2019 release, the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Health Department said there had been 129 cases in the county since May 2018. As of 15 Apr 2019, however, that number has risen to 148 cases.

Vaccines have intensified in light of the outbreak in Alabama, and the Jackson County Department of Emergency Services says a coordinated vaccine effort will get underway next month. Felix Jackson, Jackson county EMA [Emergency Management Agency] director, says all Jackson county jail employees and inmates have already been vaccinated. Jackson says his department and the ADPH will hold a joint news conference about the situation on 9 May 2019 to discuss the county's response plan.

New Hampshire health officials say a hepatitis A outbreak that has already claimed one life in the state is accelerating. The Department of Health and Human Services says they have seen 33 hepatitis A diagnoses in March 2019 alone. Since November 2018, 79 people have been diagnosed with hepatitis A, compared to an average of 6 or 7 people annually in recent years.

Since November 2019, 36 cases have been diagnosed in Hillsborough county, 17 in Strafford county, 10 in Rockingham county, 10 in Merrimack county, 2 in Cheshire county, 2 in Grafton county, one in Sullivan county, and one in Carroll county. One person from Merrimack county has died.

"Hepatitis A is spread by unknowingly getting the virus in your mouth after touching or eating items that are contaminated with small amounts of stool from an infected person. Hepatitis A can also spread from close personal contact with an infected person or caring for someone who is ill," said Beth Daly, chief of the state's Bureau of Infectious Disease Control. "Hepatitis A is preventable with a safe and effective vaccine, which is vital to stopping this outbreak. People at high risk for infection should talk with their health care provider about getting vaccinated."

To date, 18 states have declared an outbreak of hepatitis A. More than 15 000 cases and 140 deaths have been reported in the US. For more information on New Hampshire's outbreak, visit http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/dphs/cdcs/hepatitisa/hepa-nh.htm.

Idaho public health officials are warning Idahoans about a hepatitis A outbreak after more people have been infected with the virus in just 3 months in 2019 than all of 2018 combined. Public health officials are investigating the hepatitis A outbreak after 12 people have been infected with the virus since 1 Jan 2019, according to a press release from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare issued Mon 8 Mar 2019. Only 8 people were reportedly infected with hepatitis A throughout all of 2018, the release said.

"We're monitoring the situation closely," epidemiologist Randi Pedersen said in the release. "The best protection is to be vaccinated, but everyone can reduce their risk by practicing good hand hygiene. This means thoroughly washing your hands after using the bathroom, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food."

The Department of Health and Welfare said, "a lack of immunity among Idahoans over the age of 30 may be playing a role in the current outbreak in Idaho." In addition to closely monitoring the situation, experts are working to identify possible links between cases and are encouraging those in high-risk populations to get vaccinated.

"Most Idahoans reported with hepatitis A in 2019 have been so severely ill, they were hospitalized," Pedersen said in the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare release.

The hepatitis A vaccine has been routinely recommended for children since 1999; however, there are many Idahoans over the age of 30 who were not vaccinated as a child and are susceptible to the virus, the Department of Health and Welfare says.

The Idaho counties with a reported hepatitis A infection in 2019 include Canyon with 2 cases, Blaine and Twin with a combined 3 cases and Ada and Elmore with a combined 7 cases. No cases have been reported in Southeast Idaho, or the 7th Public Health District, which includes the counties of Bannock, Bear Lake, Bingham, Butte, Caribou, Franklin, Oneida and Power.

Hepatitis A cases continue to surge in Georgia, with 31 more cases reported since about a week ago, Public Health officials said Wed 17 Apr 2019. Since 1 Jun 2018, Georgia has seen 245 hepatitis A infections, with most of them coming in 2019.

The hepatitis outbreak has especially affected the Rome area of northwest Georgia, as well as Dalton, Augusta, and Fulton county, state officials say. 2/3 of the Georgia patients have been hospitalized. One Georgian has died from the disease. Georgia is one of 18 states currently experiencing a large number of cases of the highly contagious liver infection. GHN [Georgia Health News] first reported on the Georgia hepatitis A surge last month [March 2019].

Hepatitis A can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months.

The number of states with reported outbreaks of HAV continues to rise. It would be interesting to see, based on genetic testing, the spread from state to state. - Mod.LL]
