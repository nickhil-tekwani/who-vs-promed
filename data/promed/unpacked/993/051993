MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE NEED (02)
===============================

Roger A. Miller asked about Saudi Arabian travel restrictions. The following
is quoted from the GIDEON software program:
An epidemic of group A meningococcal infection was reported in 1987. 102
cases of group A meningococcal meningitis (14.7% case-fatality rate) were
confirmed in Mecca during March to April 1992, and there have been subsequent
epidemics of group C meningococcal infection. Saudi Arabia is the only
country that mandates meningococcal vaccination for entry of foreigners.
To my knowledge, Saudi Arabia is also the only country to require diphtheria
vaccination for travelers. Vaccine coverage among Saudi children is 98%. As
of 1995, routine vaccination (DTP) is administered at ages 1.5, 3, 5 and 18
months; and 4 to 6 years. DT is given at age 6 years. A vaccination
certificate is required for all pilgrims arriving from the former Soviet
Union. The latter are also routinely given benzathine penicillin
(erythromycin if penicillin-allergic).
