During 1996-1998, CDC received reports from approximately 16
state health departments of Salmonella infections in persons who
had direct or indirect contact with reptiles (i.e., lizards, snakes, or
turtles). Salmonella infection can result in invasive illness including
sepsis and meningitis, particularly in infants. Despite educational
efforts, some reptile owners remain unaware reptiles place them
and their children at risk for salmonellosis. This report summarizes
clinical and epidemiologic information in 4 cases and provides
information about state regulations to prevent transmission of
_Salmonella_ spp. from reptiles to humans.
State Regulations for Preventing Reptile-Associated Salmonellosis
During March 1999, CDC contacted all 50 state health
departments to determine whether state regulations existed for
sale of reptiles and distribution of information about salmonellosis.
Of the responding 48 states, 3 states (California, Connecticut, and
Michigan) had regulations requiring pet stores to provide
information about salmonellosis to persons purchasing a turtle; 2
states (Kansas and Maryland) require salmonellosis information to
be provided to persons purchasing any reptile. Three states
(Arizona, Minnesota, and Wyoming) prohibit reptiles in day care
centers and long-term-care facilities.

MMWR Editorial Note
---------------------------
In the United States, pet turtles were an important source of
salmonellosis until commercial distribution of pet turtles less than 4
inches long was banned in 1975 (1). This ban led to a 77%
reduction in the frequency of turtle-associated Salmonella
serotypes isolated from humans during 1970-1976 (1).
The popularity of other reptiles as pets is growing and has raised
concerns about their impact on public health. This and other
reports (2) demonstrate reptile-related salmonellosis continues to
pose a substantial threat to human health. Approximately 93,000
(7%) cases per year of _Salmonella_ spp. infections are
attributable to pet reptile or amphibian contact (3). An estimated 3%
of households in the United States have a reptile (CDC,
unpublished data, 1999). Many reptiles are colonized with
_Salmonella_ spp. and intermittently shed the organism in their
feces (4). Persons become infected by ingesting _Salmonella_
spp. after handling a reptile or objects contaminated by a reptile
and then failing to wash their hands properly. Either direct or
indirect contact with infected reptiles and their environment can
cause human illness (5,6).
Rare Salmonella serotypes, such as Java, Marina, Stanley, Poona,
and Chameleon associated with reptiles, increasingly have been
isolated from humans (7). For example, _S. marina_ isolates from
humans increased from 2 in 1989 to 47 in 1998, and _S. poona_
increased from 199 in 1989 to 341 in 1998 (8). Isolation of rare
serotypes of _Salmonella_ spp. can alert public health staff about
trends in the transmission of infection from reptiles to humans.
Most persons who contract reptile-associated salmonellosis are
infants and young children. In 1994, 413 (81%) of 513 _S. marina_
cases occurred in children aged less than 1 year, whereas 4301
(14%) of 30,723 reported salmonellosis cases occurred in children
aged less than 1 year (6). During 1989-1998, 516 (24%) of 2150
Salmonella isolates with reptile-associated serotypes were from
children aged less than 4 years, whereas 50,755 (19%) of 267,131
other serotypes were from this age group (CDC, unpublished data,
1999).
Because infants and immunocompromised persons are more
susceptible to illness, many reptile-associated Salmonella
infections involve serious complications, including septicemia and
meningitis (9).
The risks for transmission of _Salmonella_ spp. from reptiles to
humans can be reduced by thoroughly washing hands with soap
and water after handling reptiles or objects that have been in
contact with reptiles and by preventing reptile contact with food-
preparation areas. Children aged less than 5 years and
immunocompromised persons should avoid direct and indirect
contact with reptiles. Reptiles should not be kept in homes of
persons with children aged less than 1 year and in child care
facilities.
All pet store personnel and reptile owners should be aware reptiles
can carry and transmit _Salmonella_ spp. Pet stores are in a
unique position to educate consumers because reptile owners
obtain most of their information about their pet from pet store
personnel. CDC and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council
(PIJAC) have developed educational posters and brochures for
use by veterinarians and pet stores on safe pet reptile handling.*
CDC will provide assistance to states interested in developing
point-of-sale educational material; however, if these educational
efforts should prove unsuccessful, states may wish to adopt
restrictions for the sale of reptiles similar to those for turtles.
