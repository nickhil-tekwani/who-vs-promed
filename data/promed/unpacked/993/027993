Viral Encephalitis in Traveller Returned to Germany From Australia
------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. August Stich of the Wurzburg Medical Mission Institute, Unit of
Tropical Medicine and Epidemic Control, writes the following.
This report concerns a case of acute flavivirus infection in a German
tourist returning from Australia. The 23-year-old patient returned to
Germany on 27 Apr 2001 after a 6-month stay in Australia, mostly in the
Northern Territories and Queensland. One day after his return he developed
fever, followed 2 days later by conspicuous behavioral changes and severe
headache. He was transferred to the unit of Prof. Fleischer, Medical
Mission Institute in Wurzburg, on 4 May 2001 in a comatose state. Blood and
CSF examinations revealed an acute aseptic meningoencephalitis.
Serology suggested an infection by a virus of the West-Nile/Japan
Encephalitis antigen group. PCR results were negative. According to his
geographical exposure, Murray Valley encephalitis virus or Kunjin virus
were the most likely agents. The patient is currently under intensive care
but in a very critical condition. We will keep you informed of further test
results and the outcome.
It would be interesting to know whether other tourists from Australia
returned with a febrile disease or even signs of encephalitis. There is
currently no other patient with a similar condition at any of the other
TropNetEurop member clinics.

[Tourists and travellers in Australia need to be aware of the serious
consequences associated with mosquito-transmitted diseases. Responses to
Dr. Jelinek's request for information on any similar cases of viral
encephalitis would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
