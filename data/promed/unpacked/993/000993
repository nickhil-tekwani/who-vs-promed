Singapore reported 4269 hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) cases in
the 1st 3 months of this year [2010], a 15 percent increase compared
with 3705 cases in the same period last year [2009], local media
reported on Tuesday [23 Mar 2010]. According to local TV Channel News
Asia, 496 cases were recorded in the week ending [20 Mar 2010], just 4
short of the warning [alert] level of 500. The Singapore government
said that currently no child care centre has been closed due to HFMD.
HFMD usually infects children and infants. Symptoms include fever,
ulcers in the throat and rashes on the hands and feet. HFMD is spread
from person to person by direct contact through nasal discharge,
saliva, feces and fluid from the rash of an infected person.

2 children have died of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD), and
another 1717 cases have been reported since January [2010] in
Pingdingshan City in central China's Henan Province, local authorities
said Monday [22 Mar 2010]. The peak period for the disease is from May
to July, but [the peak period] fell in March this year [2010], said
Hou Jiliu, Director of the Disease Prevention and Control Center of
Pingdingshan City. The city reported a daily high of 120 cases on [11
Mar 2010], and there are currently 30 to 50 cases reported every day,
he said. Some kindergartens have been closed in Ruzhou City, which is
under the administration of Pingdingshan, officials said. Pingdingshan
has spent more than 3 million yuan (USD 439 500) buying treatment
equipment to fight the epidemic disease. Schools and kindergartens
have been ordered to conduct health checks twice a day.

HFMD is a common illness that mainly affects children under the age of
10. It usually starts with a slight fever followed by blisters and
ulcers in the mouth and rashes on the hands and feet. It is spread
through contact with the saliva or feces of the infected.

The number of children contracting hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD)
is on the rise even though the peak season is still one month away,
Children Hospitals Nos 1 and 2 in Ho Chi Minh City have announced. Dr
Truong Huu Khanh, head of the Infection and Neurology Department at
Children's Hospital No 1, said that nearly 20 children were
hospitalized due to HFMD in the past 3 days [in March 2010], which
brings the total number of infected children to 39. According to
Khanh, 28 of the cases involve serious nerve complications that
require special treatment. More than 60 percent of the patients live
in the city, while the rest come from neighbouring areas.

Dr Tran Van Thao, deputy head of Children Hospital No 2, said the
hospital received 32 children with HFMD, an increase of 50 percent
during the last week [in March 2010]. An 18-month-old baby was
reported to have been in critical condition and died 20 hours after
being hospitalized. The peak season of the illness is between April
and May. However, early hot weather has led to a sudden onset of
illness among children. EV71 [enterovirus 71] is known to cause high
fever with blisters appearing on the mouth, palms, or on the soles of
the feet. Doctors have warned that it's easy to misdiagnose the
disease as scabies. Parents should take their children to hospital
immediately if they are showing symptoms to avoid complications, such
as heart failure, lung swelling, or brain damage. Currently, there are
no vaccines or specific remedies to cure the disease, according to the
doctor.

[Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness of
infants and children. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the
genus _Enterovirus_. This genus of viruses includes polioviruses,
coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses. Coxsackievirus A16
has been the most common cause of HFMD, but other coxsackieviruses
have been associated with the illness. In recent outbreaks in Asia and
Australasia, enterovirus 71 has more often been associated with HFMD
and linked with rare neurological complications of infection. The
virus responsible for the current outbreaks in South East Asia has not
yet been identified, but the occurrence of neurological cases in Viet
Nam suggests that enterovirus 71 may be present.

HFMD occurs mainly in children under 10 years old but can also occur
in adults. Children are more likely to be at risk for infection and
illness because they are less likely than adults to have antibodies to
protect them. Such antibodies develop in the body during a person's
1st exposure to the enteroviruses that cause HFMD.

In temperate climates, cases occur more often in summer and early
autumn. The early onset of the current outbreaks of HFMD in South East
Asian countries may be a consequence of an earlier onset of warmer
weather, which may facilitate transmission of the virus. Strict
attention to personal hygiene is the only protection against infection.
