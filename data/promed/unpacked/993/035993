Health chiefs are still on the hunt for the source of poisoned
scallops which sickened 9 more people yesterday, 18 May 2010. The
contaminated shellfish have also turned up in more markets after the
scare spread to Macau, where 14 people, aged 13 to 68, have reported
falling sick since 17 May 2010.

Hong Kong's Department of Health said the reports of another 9 people
coming down with paralytic shellfish poisoning took the total number
affected to 26. All are believed to have been sickened after eating
fresh scallops bought from local markets since last Saturday, 15 May 2010.

The department has told people not to eat fresh scallops for the time
being. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, meanwhile,
ordered stall owners and suppliers to discard scallops, although its
experts have still to track down the source of the trouble.

Contaminated scallops have so far been found in markets in Sham Shui
Po, Tseung Kwan O, Lam Tin, Tin Shui Wai, Wong Tai Sin, Kowloon City,
and Tuen Mun. A spokeswoman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene
Department [FEHD] said its officers carried out investigations at the
market stalls and collected samples for tests. "FEHD officers advised
the stall owners to stop selling and to dispose of the remaining
scallops," she said.

The department's Centre for Food Safety also contacted suppliers, who
have stopped distributing. But the source remains a mystery as "no
records of sale or other import information could be provided."

Officials at the Centre for Health Protection said that 9 patients
from 18 May 2010 were 4 men and 5 women aged between 22 and 72 who
came from 4 family groups. Their main symptoms include weakness of
the limbs, dizziness, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and
slurred speech, which struck within an hour of them eating scallops at home.

[No clear source of the contaminated scallops has yet been found.
Again, the toxin(s) associated with PSP are not found in the adductor
muscle of the scallops which is generally the only part eaten (at
least in the USA). This suggests that more viscera of the scallops
were ingested or the adductor was contaminated during cooking (which
does not inactivate the toxic substance. - Mod.LL]
