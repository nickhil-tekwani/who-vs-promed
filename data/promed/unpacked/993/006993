[Four of the 18 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections in [1] probably had nosocomial transmission, as they had been admitted to the hospital for pre-existing co-morbidities weeks to months preceding the onset of symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection. Nine of the 18 newly confirmed cases had a history of contact with a known MERS-CoV infected individual. The description of case number 7 in Jeddah is confusing vis-a-vis the clinical status. There is mention that the individual had respiratory symptoms on 4 May 2014 and was admitted to a private hospital, but then it states that he is currently quarantined at home and has not developed any symptoms. Clarification would be appreciated, as it is unclear whether this was an asymptomatic case identified through contact tracing or a mildly symptomatic individual who recovered.

[Of the 10 newly confirmed cases, 5 had a history of known contact with a previously confirmed case (2 of these 5 were reported as asymptomatic; 2 are reported to be in stable condition, and one is reported to be receiving intensive care). Seven of the 10 cases were admitted to public hospitals, one in a private hospital, and 2 are under home isolation.

A recurrent question relates to the individuals with asymptomatic infections identified through contact tracing. One wonders what proportion of these individuals remain asymptomatic during the course of their infection vs. what proportion of these individuals go on to have mild clinical disease or more severe clinical disease.

[Of the 7 newly confirmed cases reported on 6 May 2014, 3 were known to have had contact with a previously confirmed case, and one had been admitted to a hospital for other co-morbidity related events and was in hospital for approximately one month prior to the onset of MERS-CoV related symptoms.

A map of the geographic locations of the 7 newly confirmed cases described above can be found at the source URL.

With the addition of the 35 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections including 6 newly reported deaths (see reports [1], [2] and [3] in this update), there have now been 449 cases of MERS-CoV infection including 121 deaths reported by Saudi Arabia. Of note, none of the cases mentioned in the above report occurred in healthcare workers (HCWs). One hopes that this is a reflection of the implementation of strict infection control procedures in the medical environment. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 7 May 2014
--------------------------------
On [15 Apr 2014], the IHR National Focal Point of Yemen notified WHO of a laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV in a 44-year-old male residing in Shibam. The patient was diagnosed as having hepatitis B and is reported to have developed symptoms on [17 Mar 2014], including fever, productive cough, chills, headache, muscle aches, and shortness of breath. He was admitted to hospital on [22 Mar 2014] in Hadramoot Governorate, and subsequently transferred on [29 Mar 2014] to an intensive-care unit of a private hospital in Sanaa. He was intubated, developed renal failure, and died on [31 Mar 2014].

Prior to the patient's decline and subsequent death, on [31 Mar 2014], oropharyngeal specimens were collected from the patient and tested positive on [2 Apr 2014]. On [24 Apr 2014], the specimens were sent to the United States' Naval Medical Research Unit-3 (NAMRU-3) for external confirmation and tested positive on 5 May 2014. Oropharyngeal specimens collected from 12 contacts of the patient tested negative at NAMRU-3.

The patient was an aircraft maintenance engineer with contact among passengers at the airport where he was working. He had no history of travel during the last month of his illness and no known contact with a confirmed case. He is reported to have visited a camel farm on a weekly basis and drank fresh raw camel milk.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[This case was reported in a ProMED-mail post on 13 Apr 2014 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (29): Saudi Arabia, Yemen, UAE, RFI 20140413.2401723). At that time, no information was available on the individual. As the individual did not have a history of travel, the geographic location of transmission of the virus was in Yemen, either through contact with an unidentified/unknown MERS-CoV infected individual, possibly at the airport in Sana'a, or through contact with infected camels during his weekly visits to a camel farm and his known exposure to fresh raw camel milk -- yet another piece of anecdotal evidence pointing at camel exposure as a possible source of transmission of the MERS-CoV.

Yemen borders Saudi Arabia to its north. For a map showing the location of Yemen, see https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2453121,38513. - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update 7 May 2014
------------------------
On 3 and 6 May 2014, the IHR National Focal Point of Jordan notified WHO of 2 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) infections.

The following details were provided to WHO on 3 May 2014 by the IHR National Focal Point for Jordan:

A 28-year-old male health-care worker complained of a headache and sore throat on [22 Apr 2014]. On [26 Apr 2014], chest X-rays showed normal findings, and testing performed on [27 Apr 2014] were negative for MERS-CoV. On [30 Apr 2014], he developed a cough and fever and was admitted to hospital in Zarka on the same day. On 2 May 2014, a chest X-ray showed pneumonia and tested positive for MERS-CoV. The patient is currently in a stable condition.

He is reported to have had close contact with a previously reported case who was also hospitalized in Zarka.

The following details were provided to WHO on 6 May 2014 by the IHR National Focal Point for Jordan:

A 56-year-old Jordanian male resident of Zarka and respiratory therapist at a private clinic was admitted to hospital on [28 Apr 2014] with pneumonia. On 3 May 2014, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and was transferred to the intensive-care unit. Throat swab specimens were collected on 4 May 2014 and tested positive for MERS-CoV on 5 May 2014. The patient died on 5 May 2014. He did not have a recent travel history or exposure to a known laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 496 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV. This total includes 229 cases reported between [11 Apr 2014 and 4 May 2014] by Saudi Arabia, and the recent reports of 3 cases from Jordan, and one case each from Egypt, the United States, and Yemen.

WHO will update the global total number of deaths as soon as official information is provided by countries.

Communicated by:
ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[According to the WHO report above, as of 4 May 2014, there have now been a total of 496 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection globally. Since 4 May 2014, there have been 38 newly confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported by Saudi Arabia on the MOH website. This moderator continues to be significantly challenged keeping up with global tallies of numbers of cases. It is clear that there is significant transmission of the MERS-CoV ongoing in Saudi Arabia since late March/early April 2014. It also appears as though there is significant nosocomial transmission of the virus when introduced into the healthcare environment, suggesting that infection control practices have been less than completely effective, very much reminiscent of the early days of the SARS outbreak. The recent cluster of cases in the UAE was an example of this, and the above 2 newly reported cases in Jordan are suggestive of this as well. While one of the cases had a documented history of exposure to a previously confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual, the 2nd case did not. Yet by profession this person is a respiratory technician, suggesting he had exposure to individuals with respiratory illness that were not diagnosed as MERS-CoV infected, yet most likely one or more of the patients he cared for may have been infected with MERS-CoV.

Epidemiological update: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
-----------------------
As of 6 May 2014, 495 cases of MERS-CoV have been reported globally, including 141 deaths. All cases have either occurred in the Middle East or have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East.

Middle East:
Saudi Arabia: 411 cases / 115 deaths
United Arab Emirates: 49 cases / 9 deaths
Qatar: 7 cases / 4 deaths
Jordan: 6 cases / 3 deaths
Oman: 2 cases / 2 deaths
Kuwait: 3 cases / 1 death
Egypt: 1 case / 0 deaths

Europe:
UK: 4 cases / 3 deaths
Germany: 2 cases / 1 death
France: 2 cases / 1 death
Italy: 1 case / 0 deaths
Greece: 1 case / 0 deaths

Africa:
Tunisia: 3 cases / 1 death

Asia:
Malaysia: 1 case / 1 death
Philippines: 1 case / 0 deaths

Americas:
United States of America: 1 case / 0 deaths

The primary case for each chain was infected in the Middle East, and local secondary transmission following importation was reported from the United Kingdom, France, and Tunisia.

The number of reported cases increased markedly in April 2014 (Figure 1) with 261 cases. Between March 2013 and March 2014, the monthly average number of reported cases was 15.

[Figure 1: Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by month of onset and probable place of infection, March 2012 - 6 May 2014 (n=495) can be found at the source URL.]

In April 2014, 4 countries (Philippines, Greece, Malaysia and Egypt) notified imported cases from Arabian Peninsula, and in May [2014], the US reported the 1st imported case (Figure 2).

[Figure 2: Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by reporting country, March 2012 - 6 May 2014 (n=495) can be found at source URL.]

As of 6 May 2014, the case-fatality ratio is 28.5 percent. The male to female ratio is 2:1. Among the 490 cases with known age, the mean age is 49 years. Median age was 50 (range 1-94 years), and 465 (95 percent) were older than 19 years. Out of the 420 cases for whom age and sex is known, 206 (49 percent) have been males aged 40 years and above.

[Figure 3: Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by age and sex, March 2012 - 31 Mar 2014 (n=206), and 1 Apr 2014 - 6 May 2014 (n=214) can be found at source URL.]

Since [1 Apr 2014], 288 cases were reported, as compared to the 207 cases reported from the beginning of the outbreak (March 2012) to [31 Mar 2014]. Among these 288 cases, 248 (86 percent) were reported by Saudi Arabia, 32 cases (11 percent) by the United Arab Emirates, 2 cases were reported by Jordan, and one case each by Egypt, Greece, Malaysia, Philippines, and the United States of America (Figure 4).

[Figure 4: Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by reporting country, 1 Apr 2014 to 6 May 2014 (n=288) can be found at source URL.]

Healthcare workers have been more frequently reported during the month of April 2014 than previously. Since April 2012, 96 cases have been healthcare workers, of whom 63 (65 percent) were reported in April 2014 compared to 35 percent before. 70 (74 percent) of the healthcare workers were reported from Saudi Arabia, 23 (24 percent) from the United Arab Emirates, and one each from Philippines, Jordan and United States of America.

The cause of the rapid increase in cases in April [2014] is unknown. The Rapid Risk Assessment of [24 Apr 2014] considers the possible scenarios that might explain this, notably:

- More sensitive case detection through more active case finding and contact tracing or changes in testing algorithms,
- Increased zoonotic transmission with subsequent transmission in healthcare settings,
- Breakdown in infection control measures or otherwise increased transmission in the local healthcare setting,
- Change in the virus resulting in more effective human-to-human transmission, resulting in both nosocomial clusters, and increased numbers of asymptomatic community acquired cases, or
- False positive lab results.

ECDC continues to monitor information on the situation on MERS-CoV worldwide. In earlier Rapid Risk Assessments, ECDC concluded that the risk of importation of MERS-CoV to the EU was expected to continue and the risk of secondary transmission in the EU remains low. The assessment provided in the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on the [24 Apr 2014] remains valid.

[The above epidemiologic review is an excellent summary and analysis of the information available on the epidemiology of MERS-CoV infected individuals. It is important to remember that information on epidemiologic characteristics of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infected individuals has not always been fully available. This is especially true when reviewing the quoted figures on involvement of healthcare workers (HCWs). According to information available, there have been a total of 96 cases of MERS-CoV infection in HCWs reported since April 2012, of which 33 occurred during the period April 2012 through 31 Mar 2014 (33 out of 206 reported infections or 16.0 percent), In contrast, in the period 1 Apr 2014 through 6 May 2014, there have been 63 cases reported in HCWs out of 214 reported infections, or 29.4 percent. Some of the increase in proportion of cases that are HCWs can be explained through the occurrence of significant nosocomial transmission where suboptimal infection control measures were observed. In addition, we know that prior to April 2014, reporting of information such as known contact with previously confirmed cases, whether individuals were HCWs, ages, and genders were not consistently provided in the reports of cases. The observation that the health care environment has been enhancing transmission of the MERS-CoV is similar to that seen with SARS transmission. - Mod.MPP]

[The media reports include more information on the returning pilgrim to Indonesia, including information that the family refused to permit specimens be taken for MERS-CoV testing. This moderator has learned anecdotally from public health officials in other countries that there have been other instances when pilgrims returning to their home countries were screened on arrival, found to be severely ill with respiratory symptoms, and refused testing.
