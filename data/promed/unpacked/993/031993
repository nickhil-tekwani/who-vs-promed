A measles epidemic is threatening Britain after cases of the disease
soared to their highest level for 13 years, health chiefs have
warned. In the first 10 months of this year [2008], there were 1049
cases of the potentially fatal virus, more than the whole of 2007 and
almost 20 times more than a decade ago.

Experts blamed the low take-up of the MMR combined measles, mumps and
rubella jab over the past decade, after it was wrongly linked to
autism. Despite government efforts to reassure parents over the
vaccine's safety, one in 4 children in England is still not receiving
the suggested 2 doses. Dr Mary Ramsay, an immunisation expert at the
Health Protection Agency, said this had caused an "unprecedented
increase" in cases. "This rise is due to relatively low MMR vaccine
uptake over the past decade, and there are now a large number of
children who are not fully vaccinated with MMR," she said. "This
means measles is spreading easily among unvaccinated children. There
is now a real risk of a large measles epidemic. These children are
susceptible not only to measles but to mumps and rubella as well."

Earlier HPA research suggested there could be an imminent epidemic of
between 30 000 and 100 000 measles cases. Mainly school-age children
would be affected, the majority living in London, and the disease
would likely prove fatal for some of them, it suggested. Others could
suffer complications such as pneumonia, hepatitis, conjunctivitis and
encephalitis (inflammation of the brain).

Fresh calls were made yesterday [28 Nov 2008] for parents in North
Wales to ensure their children receive the MMR jab as a mass
vaccination programme began in Cheshire. Health chiefs have acted in
the county following a new outbreak of 19 cases of measles, with a
further 49 youngsters suspected of contracting the disease. The
parents of 10 000 children in Cheshire have now been asked to give
consent for the MMR vaccine.

Many parents across Britain still refuse to allow their children to
have the 3-in-one jab because of a now-discredited study which
purported to link it to autism. Outbreaks of the diseases are now
becoming more common, leading to fears of an epidemic, with cases of
measles reaching a 5-year high, it was confirmed yesterday [28 Nov
2008].

Wrexham and Flintshire suffered a measles outbreak in October 2008,
with 21 cases reported. Now Flintshire county councilor David
Wisinger, who represents Queensferry, is calling for a mass
vaccination programme for unprotected children in Flintshire to match
the action being taken across the county boundary [with Cheshire]. He
said: "With this outbreak in Cheshire, which we border, it's more
important than ever that we do a mass vaccination programme for the
children of Flintshire who need it."

Wrexham Local Health Board member Mike Edwards is also calling for
help to ensure that unvaccinated children get the MMR jab. He said:
"We should be contacting all those who have not taken up the MMR jab
who are in danger." Mr Edwards, a Wrexham county borough councilor,
said some parents, fearing children may develop autism, did not take
them for an MMR jab. But, he said that that fear was proven wrong and
that controversial expert Dr Andrew Wakefield's findings had been
discredited.

A spokeswoman for the National Public Health Service for Wales said
there had been 32 cases of measles in Wales this year [2008] to the
end of October 2008. This compares to 44 in 2003, 10 in 2004, none in
2005, 4 in 2006 and 13 in 2007. She said: "It's a concern that those
32 people were not immunised. It's very contagious, and the jab is
absolutely safe." She said the 1st dose should be given to
one-year-olds then a 2nd dose at the age of 5 to complete the
immunisation.

The Meningitis Research Foundation warns that the measles and mumps
viruses can also cause meningitis and encephalitis.

[3] HPA Report: England & Wales

<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/archives/2008/news4808.htm#measles>


This article describes measles activity in October 2008 in England
and Wales; routine data on laboratory confirmed measles, mumps and
rubella for the 3rd quarter of 2008 are summarised in the Infection
Reports section of this issue [1].

In October 2008, 83 cases of measles were confirmed in England and
Wales, marginally higher than the previous month (72 cases) and
attributable to an increase in reports from outside London. The
number of cases in London remained similar to the number reported in
September 2008. The number of laboratory confirmed cases since the
start of the year is now 1049, exceeding the total of 990 for the
whole of last year [2007]. During October 2008, 9 percent of oral
fluid tests on notified cases of measles were positive; however, in
London, 15 percent of all samples tested were confirmed, whereas in
the rest of England and Wales, the proportion was 7 percent [The
original text contains a figure illustrating the number of laboratory
confirmed cases in England and Wales by month of onset: January 2007
to October 2008. - Mod.CP].

The North West region reported a further 11 cases linked to outbreaks
in schools in Cheshire [2]. Outbreaks in Wales, South East, East and
West Midlands reported previously are continuing [3]. The number of
confirmed cases in London remained constant for the 3rd consecutive
month, with cases reported from all 4 Health Protection Units in
London. A small outbreak was investigated in patients from the Polish
community in London.

Both D4 (MVs/Enfield/14.07 and MVs/Chester/38.08) are continuing to
circulate in different parts of England and Wales. Over 50 percent of
all confirmed cases this year [2008] have occurred in children of
nursery and primary school age [illustrated by a figure in the
original text].

[In keeping with earlier observations, it appears as though measles
transmission continues in the UK. The newswires in the above reports,
as well as official reports posted on ProMED-mail in the past,
attribute this resurgence of measles transmission to lower
vaccination coverages ("update") in the UK related to a very vocal
(and unfortunately successful) anti-vaccination movement within the
country. One hopes that there will not be a resurgence of SSPE
(sub-acute sclerosing pan encephalitis) associated with this
resurgence of disease -- SSPE is a progressive, non-reversible
neurologic deterioration that has been linked to measles virus
infection -- a disorder that has virtually disappeared in countries
that have successfully eliminated indigenous measles virus
transmission. A pity the anti-vaccination movement has not been
presenting the true risk benefit equation of successful measles
vaccination programs so that parents are fully armed with appropriate
data for decision making. - Mod.MPP]
