One person died from rabies in Mberengwa district last week after being bitten by an infected dog, while several domestic animals have died from the disease since the beginning of the year [2022].

The Department of Veterinary Services is presently carrying out a vaccination exercise against rabies in the Midlands to mitigate livestock mortality. The vaccination programme is targeting dogs with the thrust to reduce the spread of the disease.

Statistics show that over 20 domestic animals which succumbed to rabies included 6 donkeys, 10 dogs, 4 cows, and one cat since January [2022] after they were bitten by infected dogs this year.

Veterinary Provincial Director for Midlands Dr Martin Sibanda said the department was carrying out vaccination of rabies to all dogs in hotspots in the province to curb the spread of the disease. Dr Sibanda urged all people who were in contact with infected animals to go to hospital and seek treatment and also visit the nearest veterinary department to have their dogs vaccinated.

Communities were encouraged to report early to their nearest veterinary offices if they suspect cases of rabies and strange behaviour from their animals.

"Mass vaccination of dogs should be done twice a year, but because of limited resources, we are not able to do it. Dogs that are found with rabies are put down to prevent rabies from spreading to people and other animals.

"All dog owners should ensure that their dogs are vaccinated. If anyone is bitten by a suspicious dog, they should seek medical attention soon after they are bitten. We also encourage people to bring their dogs for vaccination," he said.

Dogs are infected by jackals, but generally an infected dog infects other unvaccinated dogs, which in turn attack livestock and people.

Last year, 5 people died from rabies in Midlands after being bitten by infected dogs.

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has confirmed 3 new cases of human rabies in South Africa. In its latest monthly update, the NICD said 2 more cases were reported in Limpopo, and one case in the Eastern Cape.

"In addition, 2 deaths from the Eastern Cape are reported as probable rabies cases; however, this could not be confirmed by laboratory testing," the NICD said.

In total, 7 human rabies deaths have been laboratory confirmed this year in South Africa as of 20 May [2022].

The Eastern Cape has reported 3 cases; Limpopo, 3 cases; and KwaZulu-Natal, one case.

In addition to the confirmed cases, 4 probable human rabies cases are recorded from the Eastern Cape.

The 5 rabies cases reported from 21 Apr to 20 May [2022] involved children between the ages of 2 and 14.

"In 4 of these cases, dog bite histories were reported.

"For one case the exposure history remains unclear.

"In 3 of the cases, no rabies post-exposure prophylaxis was sought or provided, and for the remaining 2 cases, vaccination was provided with no rabies immunoglobulin," the NICD said.

The administration of rabies immunoglobulin, a medication made up of antibodies against the rabies virus and used to prevent rabies following exposure, by infiltration of all wound sites, is critical.

[4] Spain (Mellila, N. Africa) ex Morocco: dog

Melilla has registered the 6th case of rabies so far this year [2022] in a dog that slipped across the border on 26 May [2022] and spent only 15 minutes in the autonomous city.

This positive case has been confirmed this Tuesday [7 Jun 2022], and it has not been necessary to adopt any prophylactic measure, since the animal was captured shortly after entering Melilla.

Specifically, the State Security Forces and Bodies operating at the border immediately notified the Animal Protection Service of the Local Police, which allowed the animal to be captured and transferred to the Domestic Animal Reception and Observation Center.

While in the Reception Center, he presented, in the opinion of the veterinarians of the General Directorate of Public Health and Consumption, symptoms compatible with rabies, which was confirmed this Tuesday [7 Jun 2022], after his death, in the reference laboratory.

The dog was in Melilla territory for a very short time until it was captured by the local police, although an epidemiological investigation was carried out by Public Health to identify contacts in people or animals, in collaboration with the local police, without needing to take any prophylactic measures.

Melilla has been on alert level 1 for rabies since the end of last year [2021].

[Mod.CRD's commentary in ProMED post 20211024.8699231 is applicable:

"Spain (peninsular territory and islands) has been free of terrestrial rabies since 1978, with the exception of the case of rabies imported from Morocco declared in June 2013. The vaccination campaigns carried out in dogs gave excellent results, eradicating the disease in the entire national territory. Only in the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla are there sporadically imported cases of rabies, in dogs and some horses.
