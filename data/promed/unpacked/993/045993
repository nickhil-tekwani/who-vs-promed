[More potentially damaging news came when a suspected case of classical
swine fever was identified at a pig fattening unit, the Ministry of
Agriculture said last night. The site in Ardleigh, near Colchester, Essex,
has been sealed off and officials have imposed movement restrictions, a
spokeswoman said.
Government officials in Chelmsford are investigating the suspected outbreak
of classical swine fever near Colchester.
Results from tests on samples will be ready in about 9 days. If tests on
samples prove positive for classical swine fever, all animals at the unit
will be slaughtered. More than 36 000 pigs were slaughtered after an
outbreak of the infectious disease last August, the first in Britain for 14
years.
