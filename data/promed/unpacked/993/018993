New Delhi, 5th March: Scientists have reported the emergence of new cholera
bacteria strains that produce diarrhoea symptoms and are resistant to
several drugs. These are in addition to two existing cholera bacteria
strains - 01 and O139 - which have caused major epidemics. Scientists are
referring to these new strains as entero pathogenic _Vibrio cholerae_
(EPVC), G.B. Nair from the National Institute for Cholera and Infectious
Diseases (NICID) in the eastern Indian metropolis of Calcutta reported at
an Indo-French symposium on drug resistance here in the Indian capital.
We are beginning to think that a new group of _Vibrio cholerae_ has started
coming to Calcutta, Nair said. These new strains, which are coming to light
at the infectious diseases hospital in Calcutta, do not produce the cholera
toxin present in other disease-causing cholera strains but contain other
genes for virulence and are toxic to cells, Nair said. They produce
diarrhoea symptoms similar to other infectious bacteria akin to _Shigella_
and _E. coli_ and are multi-drug resistant. Two major cholera-causing
strains have already been reported from India. These are _Vibrio cholerae_
01 and a more recent _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 which was responsible for the
eighth cholera pandemic in India and Bangladesh in 1993 and 1994. During an
outbreak, one of these two strains dominates.

[A quick Medline search reveals the following. The presence of an
integrase gene similar to those commonly found in antibiotic resistance
integrons has been reported for _Vibrio cholerae_ by Mazel et al. (Science,
1998 Apr, 280:5363, 605-8). Strains of _V. cholerae_ exhibiting increased
resistance to tetracycline, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole have been
reported among strains isolated in Africa (East Afr Med J, 1997 Mar, 74:3,
193-7). It is likely that antibiotic resistance among _V. cholerae_
isolates will be more widely recognized in the future. - Mod.ES]
