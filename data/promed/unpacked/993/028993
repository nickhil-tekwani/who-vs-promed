In 2009, the state of Alaska reported only 5 cases of the sexually transmitted infection, syphilis; however, since that time, the number of cases has increased 8-fold, according to data from the State of Alaska Section of Epidemiology (SOE). 2014 saw the number of syphilis cases rise to 40, with 31 (84 percent) of whom identified as gay, bisexual, or other men who have sex with men (MSM).

Other key findings include: 6 (15 percent) were in persons who were co-infected with chlamydia or gonorrhea; and 4 (10 percent) were in persons coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); 3 (8 percent) were in persons who were subsequently diagnosed with neurosyphilis, 2 of whom experienced ocular involvement. [See http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cdc-issues-ocular-syphilis-clinical-advisory-37337/ and ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (04): (WA, CA) ocular, MSM 20150318.3239070.]

In addition, the investigation into the 2014 cases revealed that 31 (80 percent) reported multiple or anonymous partners and 25 (63 percent) reported that they sought sexual partners via the Internet and phone apps (e.g., Craigslist, Grindr, Scruff).

Health officials note that the ongoing syphilis outbreak continues to be fueled in part by persons engaging in anonymous sex, often with partners found through the Internet and mobile phone apps.

To date in 2015, Alaska has seen 2 syphilis cases.

[In Alaska, as in other localities in the United States and in many countries around the world, the incidence of syphilis is rising, and an increasingly large proportion of cases is occurring in men who have sex with men (MSM). Cases in MSM have been characterized by high rates of HIV co-infection and high-risk sexual behavior, such as multiple anonymous partners and use of mobile phone dating apps, such as Tinder and Grindr, to find sexual partners. Grindr is a smartphone app that uses global-positioning technology to find anonymous sex partners within close proximity who are also on Grindr (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr).

Other reasons for the syphilis epidemic in MSM include: 1) an overly optimistic thinking that HIV is no longer the death threat that it once was as a consequence of antiretroviral treatment; 2) use of pre-exposure HIV chemoprophylaxis; 3) an increase in recreational drug use that facilitates high-risk sexual behavior; and 4) serosorting, which is selective unprotected sex with partners of the same HIV-serostatus. A prior ProMED-mail post mentioned that many of these factors were driving the increasing incidence of syphilis in MSM that was occurring in the city of Anchorage, where approximately half of Alaska's 735 132 residents live (Syphilis - USA (08): (AK,OR) rising incidence, MSM, social networking apps 20140602.2513266).

A recent article posted by ProMED-mail reported that HIV infected gay men seek out other HIV-positive sex partners to avoid using condoms; but, of course, this situation allows transmission of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other sexually transmitted diseases (Syphilis & gonococcal dis. - USA (04): (OR) rising incidence, MSM, HIV coinfect. 20140608.2527642).

Alaska is a US state situated in the northwest extremity of the North American continent, bordered to the east by the Canadian territory of Yukon and the Canadian province of British Columbia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska). - Mod.ML
