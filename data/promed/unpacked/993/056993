The provincial health minister, Marcel Kambumbu, [has] confirmed the presence of an unknown illness, which has already killed 15 people and more than 100 people ill within the past 2 weeks in the territory of in the village of Iremera, Bulengya group of Lubero (North Kivu). He said, however, that it was not yet possible to speak of an epidemic.

The area chief doctor of Iremera has announced an epidemic in this area, advancing the same record of 15 deaths and 100 registered patients.

"I myself have received this information [from the sick]. But I can say that there are still rumors, because at the level of the Department of Health, we have what is called an epidemiological surveillance system and every week we have reports of diseases in the province," said minister Marcel Kambumbu. He insisted that only the provincial governor could declare an epidemic in a health zone.

"The one who declares the epidemic or something urgent is the provincial governor. So at the present stage, we cannot make any statement outside the epidemiological surveillance data, "continued Marcel Kambumbu. He further stated that sampling had been done for analysis at the level of the epidemiological surveillance system, with a view to identifying the disease.

[There is no information here to define an etiology of these illnesses and deaths. Useful information to help in the differential diagnosis would be signs and symptoms of the illness and the illness progression, and an epidemiological curve showing cases over time would be helpful. - Mod.LL
