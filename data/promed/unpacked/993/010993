[These are the 1st 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported since 1 Nov 2016. Of note, both cases were reported from Buraidah, and both cases were classified as primary cases with histories of possible high risk exposures under investigation. On 29 Oct 2016, there was another primary case with exposure histories under investigation reported from Buraidah as well. On 18 Oct 2016 there was a primary case with a history of direct camel contact reported from Buraidah as well. A question that comes to mind is whether there was any connection between the possible index case reported on 18 Oct 2016 and the 3 other "primary" cases reported on 29 Oct 2016 and 3 Nov 2016 ... perhaps they sought medical assistance outside of the hospital environment with a healthcare worker who also attended the MERS-CoV case reported on 18 Oct 2016, or was in the vicinity of the camel farm where the earliest case had been.

Maps showing the locations of the 2 newly reported cases and 2 newly reported recoveries can be found at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]
