Barium carbonate is a rodenticide that causes a rapid redistribution
of potassium, leading to muscle weakness and death. It is described as
a white powder in some references. Realise that this still does not
fit the description of purple extremities as well as nitrates do, but
a reminder that the vertebrate poisons commonly used in one country
may be unknown in another.
