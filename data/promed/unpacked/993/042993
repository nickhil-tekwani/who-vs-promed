Officials have launched a probe into the unusual incident and urged the local public to abstain from eating the dead cuttlefish as doing so could lead to food poisoning, Chile's Cooperativa online media outlet reported.

Thousands of dead cuttlefish have been washed up on a popular beach in Chile. The incident occurred at the Bahia Inglesa Beach [Atacama], a popular tourist spot, and it is feared that the occurrence could be linked to pollution or global warning.

The species involved is not a cuttlefish (_Sepia_ spp.), but the Humboldt squid (_Dosidicus gigas_). Humboldt squid typically reach a mantle length of 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in). A similar episode in which about 10 000 squids died happened in January 2016 in Santa Mar√≠a Island (1000 km/625 mi south). - Mod.PMB
