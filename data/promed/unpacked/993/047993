41 teams mobilized to fight against yellow fever
-------------------------------------
The Chief Medical officer announced in a press briefing that the Medical Region of Kedougou has mobilized 41 vaccination teams for a vaccination campaign against yellow fever.

According to Dr. Habib Ndiaye, who reported 3 cases of yellow fever, "the entire population of 3 health districts - Kedougou, Saraya and Salemata - are being covered with the exception of pregnant women, children under 9 months [of age] and people who were already vaccinated during previous campaigns during the last 10 years"

"A strategic plan has been established for the 82 trained health workers, the 82 aides, and 8 supervisors who will go anywhere", he said praising the contribution of the red cross who "has invested both materially and with personnel to the success of this campaign."

In an interview with the APS, the regional chief medical officer emphasized that the vaccination sites "are health posts, schools and public places of the villages and neighborhoods."

Habib Ndiaye provided 160 000 doses [of yellow fever vaccine] "to vaccinate the entire population", taking into account the influx of people into the gold [mining] zones at Gamou de Salemata and those crossing the border." [Kedougou is located in the South east of Senegal bordering with Guinea. - Mod.MPP]

Yellow fever is a viral disease caused by a virus transmitted by mosquito bites and is manifested by fever and jaundice.

In closing, Habib Ndiaye said: "Because the region is fertile ground, there must be a mobilization of the entire population to stop yellow fever".

[A campaign response is welcome. The government did well to take the bull by the horns, because the lethality associated with the disease is very high. At present there is no specific treatment for yellow fever. The use of bednets by people (as in the case of malaria) could prevent human-vector contact and reduce the transmission of the disease. Neighboring countries, because [of the fact that] the borders are porous and that people can easily obtain a vaccination record in [apparent] "good standing" without actually being vaccinated, must (neighboring countries) reinforce their vigilance and strengthen their[disease] surveillance efforts for yellow fever.

[There were YF cases in the Kedougou Medical Region in October 2011. The above cases may be the same ones reported last year (2011). The health districts of Kedougou and Saraya had a preventive mass vaccination campaign in December 2007, where the vaccination coverage was 94.9 per cent and 94.8 per cent respectively. The Ministry of Health of Senegal planned to organize a vaccination campaign in mid-December 2011, targeting the non-vaccinated individuals aged 9 months and above, excluding pregnant women in Kedougou, Saraya, and Salemata health districts. Perhaps the above campaign is the one planned earlier, but had been delayed. Clarification from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated. - Mod. TY/JW]
