[3] Fatal case in Brazil
Date: Tue 30 Aug 2022

https://outbreaknewstoday.com/rio-de-janeiro-reports-1st-monkeypox-death-31564/


On Monday [29 Aug 2022], Rio de Janeiro recorded the 1st death by monkeypox in the state.

The patient, a 33-year-old man, was hospitalized at Hospital Ferreira Machado, in Campos dos Goytacazes, in the north of Rio de Janeiro. The Municipal Health Department of Campos reported that the victim had low immunity and comorbidities, which worsened the disease.

The patient had complications and needed to be transferred to an ICU bed on [19 Aug 2022]. Campos is monitoring people who had contact with the patient, but so far, no one has shown signs and symptoms of infection by the virus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
A global monkeypox outbreak is currently primarily affecting gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.

What is added by this report?
In a recent survey of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, approximately 1/2 reported reducing their number of sex partners, one-time sexual encounters, and use of dating apps because of the monkeypox outbreak. Receipt of vaccine to protect against monkeypox varied by race, ethnicity, and geography.

What are the implications for public health practice?
It is essential that public health programs continue to deliver tailored, respectful harm reduction messages that do not create stigma to diverse communities of men who have sex with men. Vaccine programs should prioritize efforts to maximize equitable access.

[5] DNA and infectivity

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
The current monkeypox virus global spread and lack of data regarding clinical specimens' infectivity call for examining virus infectivity, and whether this correlates with results from PCR, the available diagnostic tool. We show strong correlation between viral DNA amount in clinical specimens and virus infectivity toward BSC-1 cell line. Moreover, we define a PCR threshold value (Cq ≥ 35, ≤ 4,300 DNA copies/mL), corresponding to negative viral cultures, which may assist risk assessment and decision-making regarding protective measures and guidelines for patients with monkeypox.

[6] Antibody levels

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In July 2022, the ongoing monkeypox (MPX) outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA-BN, also known as Imvamune, Jynneos, or Imvanex) is a 3rd generation smallpox vaccine that was generated by serial passaging of the more pathogenic parental vaccinia virus (VACV), and is authorized as a vaccine against MPX in humans in a 2-shot regimen. Up to now, there is a lack of data that demonstrate MPX virus (MPXV)-neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated individuals and vaccine efficacy data against MPXV infection. Here, we measure MVA-, VACV-, and MPXV-reactive binding and neutralizing antibodies with validated in-house assays in cohorts of historically smallpox-vaccinated, MPXV PCR-positive, and recently MVA-BN-vaccinated individuals. We show that MPXV neutralizing antibodies were detected across all cohorts in individuals with MPXV exposure as well as those who received historic (VACV) vaccination. However, a primary MVA-BN immunization series in non-primed individuals yields relatively low levels of MPXV neutralizing antibodies. As the role of MPXV neutralizing antibodies for protection against disease and transmissibility is currently unclear and no correlate of protection against MPXV infection has been identified yet, this raises the question how well vaccinated individuals are protected. Dose-sparing leads to lower antibody levels, whereas a 3rd MVA vaccination further boosts the antibody response. Cohort studies following vaccinated individuals are necessary to further assess vaccine efficacy in risk populations and determine correlates of protection for this emerging pathogen.

[The authors of the study reported in item 6 raise the key question about the effectiveness of the monkeypox vaccine in preventing infection and subsequent disease. One hopes that the cohort studies will clarify that point. - Mod.TY]
