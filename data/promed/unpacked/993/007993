Since the discovery of a cow infected with BTV-11 in the province of
East Flanders, the FAVV has, in the context of its monitoring
program, discovered 7 additional cattle farms where the same variant
of bluetongue is present. These holdings are located in the provinces
of Flemish Brabant, Antwerp and Limburg [map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/belgium_rel_1985.pdf>.
- Mod.AS].

In cooperation with the European Commission, the Belgian Reference
Laboratory CODA and the European reference laboratory in Pirbright
(UK), the Food Agency's investigations continue to determine the
precise extent of the problem and whether -- as suspected -- a
non-harmful vaccine virus is present. This presumption is not only
supported by a limited genetic analysis (of the virus) that shows a
great similarity with a vaccine strain used in Africa but also by the
properties of the BTV-11 virus found, which caused no clinical
problems [see also item 2]. To date, only a very limited number of
holdings are infected, and, at any of these farms, only one or 2
animals have been reportedly infected.

The Food Agency is aware that these instructions still need to be
substantiated. While in wait for further results of the
investigation, several measures have been applied to protect any
possible risk to Belgium's trading partners receiving ruminants from
Belgium. Thus, a large temporary control zone has been defined around
the affected farms. All breeding and fattening animals intended for
trade which are kept in this temporary control area or have left this
area after 1 Nov 2008 and held elsewhere have to be sampled within 7
days (before departure) and tested for BTV-11. Animals will only be
accepted for trade when the results of the laboratory are favorable.

The temporary control zone includes the provinces of Antwerp and
Limburg, excluding Voeren, and parts of the provinces of Flemish
Brabant and East Flanders, situated north of the E40 and the
ring-road around Brussels and east of the R4 around and north of Ghent.

It is not excluded that in the coming weeks the FAVV will discover
further BTV-11 infected farms in its monitoring programs. If these
are located outside the currently designated temporary control area,
the area will be extended based on new findings, and the same
measures will have to apply. If the investigations show that indeed a
non-pathogenic strain is involved, the Food Agency will lift the
restrictions after consultations with the European Commission.

Bluetongue Virus Vaccines: Solution or Part of the Problem? By J.
Maclachlan, University of California, Davis, CA, USA
-----------------------------------------------
Bluetongue (BT) is an insect-transmitted disease of ruminants caused
by BT virus (BTV). The disease was 1st described after European
settlers introduced their fine-wool breeds of sheep to Southern
Africa in the 17th century.

BTV infection has since been described on all continents except
Antarctica, coincident with the distribution of competent
_Culicoides_ vectors. Climate change is likely responsible for the
remarkable recent expansion of BTV's global range, especially in Europe.

Modified live (MLV) BTV vaccines were 1st developed in South Africa.
Embryonated egg propagated MLV vaccines developed in California were
teratogenic if used in pregnant sheep and were replaced by cell
culture-propagated vaccines.

Phylogenetic analyses confirm that individual genes of field strains
of BTV in California are identical to those of MLV vaccines,
suggesting that vector insects naturally can acquire and transmit
vaccine viruses (or reassortant viruses that include MLV genes), as
also demonstrated recently in Italy.

The original MLV vaccine caused characteristic brain defects in
congenitally infected progeny, defects that occur sporadically in
regions where these vaccines are used. Significantly, until the
emergence of BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) in northern Europe, congenital
BTV infection only was described in regions where MLV vaccines are
used. The European strain of BTV-8 commonly causes teratogenic brain
defects in the progeny of cattle infected during early gestation,
defects that are identical to those caused by the original MLV
vaccines, a fact that raises concerns regarding the origin/history of
this strain of BTV-8.

Inactivated BTV vaccines have been developed because of the
propensity of MLV vaccines to revert to virulence, their capacity to
be acquired and transmitted by _Culicoides_ insects, and because of
the capacity of BTV to generate extensive genetic diversity through
reassortment and genetic drift. However, inactivated vaccines also
have inherent deficiencies, which have stimulated development of new
generation vaccines including baculovirus-expressed virus-like
particles and recombinant expression systems, most notably
recombinant canarypox virus vectors that express immunogenic proteins
of BTV and that induce sterilizing immunity in vaccinated ruminants.

[ProMED-mail posting 20090211.0622, reporting a single cow found
BTV-11 positive in Belgium, included the comment "such a one-off shot
is rather enigmatic." The enigma is somewhat addressed by the
"relieving" discovery of additional reactors. Similar to the
discovery of BTV-6 in eastern Netherlands and in the adjacent German
territory, vaccine strains deserve serious consideration and
investigation. Dr Maclachlan's timely paper is helpful in clarifying
the background while indicating the need for thorough investigation
efforts. These may preferably cover also neighboring Dutch territories.

Belgium submitted its last presentation to EU's Standing Committee on
the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) on 8 Jan 2009; this
presentation did not include information on BTV-11. During the last
SCFCAH meeting, 3-4 Feb 2009, Belgium did not submit a bluetongue
presentation (while such presentations were submitted by Austria,
Italy, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, and the Netherlands; see map at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations_en.htm#34022009>).

Belgium is expected to address the BTV-11 issue during the next
SCFCAH meeting, scheduled in Brussels on 3-4 Mar 2009. A day earlier,
on 2 Mar 2009, the issue is due to be discussed by EU's bluetongue
working group. - Mod.AS]
