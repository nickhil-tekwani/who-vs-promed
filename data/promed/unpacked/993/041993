Kawasaki, a rare infectious disease mostly affecting children, has shown up
in the Sarawak state of Malaysia and in the US capital.
In Malaysia, eight children under the age of three years have died in the
past two months. [It is not known if these eight deaths represent the total
case number.]
In the US, one 3-year-old boy has been diagnosed with the disease and, after
gamma
globulin therapy, has improved.
Kawasaki disease is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.
Symptoms that distinguish it from other childhood diseases that are marked
by rash and high fever are red & swollen hands and feet with subsequent
peeling of skin on the fingers, toes and groin.
