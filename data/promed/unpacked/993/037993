[1] These peppers...

Call it the smoking jalapeno. After nearly 2 months of mystery, the
USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified a jalepeno
pepper that is contaminated with the same strain of _Salmonella_
Saintpaul that has sickened more than 1237 people in 43 states.

It's the first time during this outbreak that a test has found the
strain in a piece of produce. The discovery, which will be announced
shortly by the FDA, was made at a packing plant in McAllen, Texas,
according to a source familiar with the issue. The pepper was grown
in Mexico, the source said, but was sent to the USA for sale.
Authorities are not sure where it was contaminated with organism.

It is also not clear whether the same packing plant, which has not
been named by the FDA, also packs tomatoes. The FDA first suspected
tomatoes as the cause of the salmonella outbreak and warned consumers
on 7 Jun 2008 to avoid certain types of tomatoes. It lifted that
warning last week [14-18 Jul 2008].

Because people continued to get sick after the tomato warning, the FDA
and the CDC shifted their investigation to jalapeno and serrano
peppers, which sick people had [also] reported eating. For the FDA,
which was under public and political pressure to find the cause of the
salmonella outbreak, the discovery of a smoking pepper is a big
breakthrough.

[2] Not these peppers and avocado
Date: Sat 19 Jul 2008

According to the Texas and North Carolina Departments of Health, the
strain of _Salmonella_ found in Grande Produce, LTD, of Hidalgo,
Texas, jalapeno and serrano peppers and in its avocado is not
_Salmonella_ Saintpaul, and is not believed to be related to the
current outbreak.

The recall is a result of sampling not by the FDA but by the Texas
Department of State Health Services (Texas Health) and the North
Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (North Carolina
Health) which revealed that these products contained the bacteria.

The company has voluntarily initiated a recall of its already
distributed products and has stopped future distribution while the
FDA, Texas Health, North Carolina Health and the company continue to
investigate to determine the source of the problem.

No human cases related to this recall have been reported.

[ProMED does not usually report recalls not associated with human
cases (except for botulism) but this recall is noteworthy in its
negative association with the current _S._ Saintpaul outbreak. - Mod.LL
