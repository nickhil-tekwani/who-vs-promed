Four cases of trypanosmiasis imported from Malawi
-----------------------------------------------
Trypanosomiasis was confirmed in 4 travelers to Malawi in the last
month. The travelers were from Canada, Great Britain and Australia,
respectively; all had a history of travel in the preceding 1-3 weeks
to the Kasunga National Park, and 2 had also traveled to the Vwasa
Marshes National Park in northern Malawi. All the patients presented
with acute onset of fever; one patient had a trypanosomal chancre,
and trypanosomiasis was confirmed in all patients on peripheral blood
smear.
Thrombocytopenia was noted in 2 patients; one patient experienced
hallucinations, and one patient developed a hepatitis either as an
adverse reaction to suramin or as a complication of disease.
Examination of cerebrospinal fluid was normal in all patients. To
date, all patients have responded well to suramin treatment,
administered in South Africa. East African trypanosomiasis is an
uncommon but acute often fulminant and potentially fatal disease in
travelers that is frequently missed or misdiagnosed as malaria.
In November 2005, 2 travelers were also treated in South Africa for
trypanosomiasis acquired in the Kasunga National Park, Malawi. Since
2001 a total of 18 cases of East African trypanosomiasis have been
treated in South Africa in travelers to Malawi, Tanzania, Zambia,
Zimbabwe and Kenya.
Tourists visiting game reserves in central and east African countries
should be alerted to the danger of this disease for which there are
no effective preventive measures, but which if acquired, requires
expert diagnosis and treatment.

[ProMED appreciates receiving this report from Dr. Blumberg and
colleagues. Trypanosomiasis has been emerging for almost a decade in
Africa. In 2001, tourists visiting Tanzania acquired trypanosomiasis,
and recent outbreaks in Angola, Congo, Zimbabwe and probably Sudan
have underlined that the infection is not under control. The recent
report illustrates that Malawi also is an endemic country, with cases
in the indigenous population not being reported, but travelers
infected show that the infection is endemic in the area. More
information on African trypanosomiasis can be found at the Programme
Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT) website:
