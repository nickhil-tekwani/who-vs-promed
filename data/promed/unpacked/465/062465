Russia: South Urals prepare for tick encephalitis season
-----------------------------------------------
Anatoly Semenov, the chief health officer of the Chelyabinsk region
(Oblast) has signed a document implementing urgent measures for
prophylaxis of tick-borne encephalitis. In previous years, the 1st
tick bites in the South Urals were recorded in March, after the 1st
spring thaws. The Chelyabinsk Territorial Management of
Rospotrebnadzor [The Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer
Rights and Human Welfare - Mod.NP] informed a Novie Region Agency
correspondent that almost 18 000 inhabitants of the South Urals
experienced tick bites in 2006. A total of 126 cases of tick-borne
encephalitis, including 3 fatalities, as well as 260 cases of Lyme
disease were recorded last year [2006] in the South Urals. Overall,
the level of morbidity from tick-borne infections in the South Urals
was 1.5-fold greater than elsewhere in Russia. The highest morbidity
was recorded in the Kunashakskiy, Uiskiy, Nazepetrovskiy and
Nagajbakskiy districts, and also in Plast and Karabash. Almost 28 per
cent of those affected received their tick-bites in residential areas
of cities and villages, a circumstance that is causing alarm.
Rospotrebnadzor has explained this development as the consequence of
low uptake by the population of preventative vaccine. In 2006, only 6
percent of inhabitants of the South Urals were vaccinated.
Anatoly Semenov recommended that the heads of municipalities should
provide vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis for people
working in forests and woodland areas and also supply them with
protective clothing and repellents. Children and teenagers who have
not been vaccinated should not be permitted to participate in hiking,
excursions and ecological activities. Likewise, a similar restriction
should be considered by those organizing outdoor activities and
holidays for other groups during the May to July period in the coming year.

[Last year (2006), increased tick activity was observed in a several
regions in Russia (Pskov, Kemerovo, Chita, Nizhniy Novgorod,
Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Irkutsk, republics: Khakassia, Buryatiya and
Mariy El), and also in Latvia and Estonia. In total, 3510 cases
(morbidity 2.44 per 100 000 inhabitants) of tick-borne encephalitis
were registered in Russia in 2006. That is 22.7 percent less than in 2005.
In the same year [2006], Lyme disease was registered in 7451 persons
(morbidity 5.18 per 100 000 inhabitants), which is 0.3 percent less
than in 2005; see <http://www.fcgsen.ru/>.
The Chelyabinsk (South Ural) region is in the centre of Russia at the
border of Europe and Asia, at the southern foothills of the Ural
mountains and the adjoining plain. In the north, the Chelyabinsk
region borders the Sverdlovsk region, in the east the Kurgan region;
it also has borders with the Orenburg region in the south and with
the Republic of Bashkortostan in the west. The southeastern part of
the region borders the Republic of Kazakhstan. - Mod.NP]
