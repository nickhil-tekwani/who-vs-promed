Rates of hepatitis C in Scotland are more than 7 times higher than
those of neighboring countries, and 20 times those reported in the
United States [1,2]. See graph at

Hepatitis C in the UK, 2011 report
----------------------------------
More than an estimated 216 000 people in the UK are chronically
infected with hepatitis C (HCV), according to data for 2010 contained
in Hepatitis C in the UK: 2011 report, published on the HPA website
[1] to coincide with the World Health Organization's World Hepatitis
Day on 28 July [2]. This is a concern, in particular because many of
these individuals remain undiagnosed.

In England, an estimated 161 000 -- 0.4 per cent of the adult
population -- are chronically infected, according to the report. The
estimated numbers chronically infected in Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland are 39 000, 12 000, and 4000 respectively.

The main chapters of the new report describe, in turn, diagnosis,
prevention, treatment, and awareness-raising activities in England,
Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. A final section presents
consolidated data for the UK as a whole -- including an assessment of
the burden that HCV infection presents on the UK health service: a
number of sources of national data are used to demonstrate that
HCV-related hospital admissions, transplants, and deaths continue to
rise. By 2020, for example, the report estimates that over 15 000
people will be living with either HCV-related cirrhosis or liver
cancer caused by hepatitis C in England [3].

As in previous HPA reports on HCV, the high prevalence of infection in
particular groups is shown to be a key characteristic of the disease
in the UK: injecting drug users (IDUs) are at greatest risk of
acquiring infection and some minority ethnic populations also have
higher rates of infection than the white, UK-born population.

Prevention and awareness-raising
--------------------------------
In England, following continuous investment in community drug
treatment, the number of people in contact with such services exceeded
206 000 in 2009/10. In all UK countries, data suggest declining rates
of risky injecting practices, the report notes. However, despite these
initiatives, data from the Unlinked Anonymous Monitoring Survey of
Injecting Drug Users in Contact with Specialist Services (UAM) in 2010
[4] suggest that 49 per cent and 57 per cent of IDUs in England and
Scotland, respectively, are positive for HCV antibody (levels are
lower in Northern Ireland and Wales), underlining the importance of
ongoing efforts to target this highest-risk group of the population.

Because hepatitis C is usually asymptomatic in the early years of
infection, and consequently many individuals remain undiagnosed, a
variety of initiatives to increase public awareness of hepatitis C are
ongoing. These include campaigns directly addressed to the high-risk
groups themselves -- such as The Hepatitis C Trust's well-established
Get Tested! campaign -- and education programmes for health care
professionals. These include: an e-learning package in Northern
Ireland; a Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Certificate
in the Detection and Diagnosis of Hepatitis C in Primary Care in
England; and a Train the Trainer course on bloodborne viruses (BBVs)
in Wales aimed at individuals from across a range of social, health,
and other contexts working with individuals at risk of BBV infection.

Diagnosis and testing
---------------------
There was a significant increase in new, laboratory-confirmed HCV
diagnoses in Scotland in 2010, the report notes, whereas in the rest
of the UK, laboratory reports -- albeit known to underestimate the
true levels of diagnosis -- suggest a fall in the numbers diagnosed
over the past year. Although diagnosis by general practitioners (GPs)
in Scotland declined in 2010, despite the launch of professional and
public awareness campaigns earlier that year, this was more than
offset by the increase in diagnosis in drug treatment/harm reduction
settings. When data from enhanced surveillance systems are taken
together, testing patterns and self-reports both suggest that HCV
testing among IDUs in England is increasing, as is testing via primary
care and among individuals of South Asian origin, suggesting increased
awareness of HCV across all these groups and settings.

Even though integrated drug treatment has been further rolled out
across the English prison population, the HPA data do not support an
increase in testing in English prisons over the past year.

Roll out of the recently available technique of dried blood spot (DBS)
testing -- which has contributed to increased levels of testing in
IDUs in England, Scotland, and Wales -- has been pilot-tested in
Northern Ireland and is being rolled out across the prison population
in Wales.

Burden of HCV-related disease on health services
------------------------------------------------
Although HCV is a chronic infection, antiviral treatments are
available that will successfully clear the virus in the majority of
patients. However, unless a significant increase in those receiving
effective treatment occurs, the future burden of HCV-related disease
will be substantial, the HPA report concludes. All national data
sources (hospital admissions for HCV-related end-stage liver disease,
liver transplants, and deaths) show that HCV-related liver disease is
continuing to rise and it is predicted that in 2020, 15 840
individuals will be living with HCV-related cirrhosis or
hepatocellular carcinoma in England alone. This is illustrated in the
report's final section by reference to recent trends in HCV related
hospital admissions (figure 1 -- available at the source URL above),
transplants, and deaths.
