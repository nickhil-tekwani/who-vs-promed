The Centre for Health Protection has found 2 different strains of
_Streptococcus pyogenes_ involved in 2 recent scarlet fever deaths.
The 7 year old girl who died on 29 May 2011 at Queen Mary Hospital
tested positive for the strain "emm 12". The 5 year old boy who died
on 21 Jun 2011 at Princess Margaret Hospital had the "emm 1" strain.

Further tests are being conducted. In the 24 hours ending at noon
today [23 Jun 2011], the centre had recorded 32 cases of scarlet fever
and 4 outbreaks of the illness.

[Microbial strain typing is a useful adjunct to clinical
epidemiology. Phenotypic typing systems examine expressed
characteristics, such as the serologic M protein typing system
developed by Dr Rebecca Lancefield in 1928, whereas genotypic systems
examine chromosomal or plasmid DNA. Group A streptococci
(_Streptococcus pyogenes_) strains are now commonly classified on the
basis of sequence variation in the 5' end of the emm gene. The 5' ends
of emm gene are highly heterogeneous and encode for the serotype
specificity used for the M-typing system. For most M serotypes, there
is a one-for-one relationship with a unique emm sequence type
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no2/facklam.htm).

Epidemiologic studies in the US suggest that a significant percentage
of the serious suppurative and non-suppurative sequelae of group A
streptococcal infections are associated with a relatively small number
of specific emm/M protein types. For example, the 2 most prevalent emm
types were 1, 12, accounting for about 36 per cent of pharyngitis
isolates in the United States and Canada
(http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/1/78.full). In a study
from Taiwan, emm 12 was also the most frequent (43.4 per cent) emm
type among a total of 242 isolates recovered from 76 patients with
invasive disease, 89 with scarlet fever, and 77 with pharyngitis
(http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/47/8/2658.pdf).

Other molecular techniques to further characterize outbreak strains
include pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of chromosomal DNA
fragments, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and detection of
exotoxin-encoding genes
(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670197901948,
http://www.jstor.org/pss/30128192,
http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/short/69/4/2416, and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20687911). We await further
characterization of the outbreak isolates.
