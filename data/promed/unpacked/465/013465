Background Information on Hantavirus Infections in France
-------------------- ------------------------------------
[The following information has been extracted from the Gideon database.]
Autochthonous hantavirus infection was first confirmed in France in 1982 (1
case) and 1983 (one case). 11 additional cases were confirmed during 1983 to
1984.
Virtually all cases are reported from northeastern France. The Ardennes
accounts for 39 percent of cases, Picardie 25 percent, Cote-d'Or - Haute
Marie 14 percent, Lorraine 12 percent, & Franche-Comte 10 percent. 31 cases
were reported from Charleville-Mezieres during 1994 to 1996; and 244 from the
entire Ardennes massif during 1991 to 1999. 14 cases were diagnosed in Ile
de France during 1999 to 2000.
In total 498 cases were reported up to 1993, and approximately 800 to 1998:
- 29 cases were reported in 1983;
- 37 in 1985;
- 85 in 1990;
- 56 in 1991;
- 188 in 1993.
Over 200 cases were reported in 1996.
The local strain [virus species] is Puumala virus. Dobrava/Belgrade virus
also appears to be active. The local rodent reservoirs are _Clethrionomys
glariolus_ [the bank vole] and _Apodemus sylvaticus_ [a species of field
mouse].
