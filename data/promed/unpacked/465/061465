[1] Case update
- Thu 8 Nov 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=16a2ac3656

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 7 Nov 2018:
- A total of 312 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 277 were confirmed and 35 are probable.
- Of the 277 confirmed cases, 156 have died and 91 have recovered. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 40 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni, 2 in Kalunguta and 1 in Mutwanga.
- Mutwanga is a new health zone affected. It is a health zone close to that of Beni. The new case is a known contact followed by a confirmed case of Beni who refused vaccination and fled to Mutwanga before the end of his follow-up. The central office of the Mutwanga Health Zone, which had been informed of the presence of a high-risk contact in their territory, found him ill. He finally agreed to be transferred to the ETC of Beni.
- No confirmed case deaths.

[Note new health zone affected, Mutwanga. But fortunately, the infected individual was located and agreed to enter the ETC in Beni. One hopes he had minimal close contact with others in Mutwanga.

It is encouraging there were no further deaths, but the case number continues to increase.

Also - See Helen Branswell https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell:
Today's 4 cases bring the total number in this outbreak to 312 confirmed and probable cases. That's 3 shy of the total for the 1995 Kitwit outbreak (the 4th largest ever) and 5 cases shy of Yambuku, the 1st known #Ebola outbreak in 1976. North Kivu will surpass both soon. - Mod.LK]

[2] New measures and strong partnership
Date: Thu 8 Nov 2018
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]

New measures to overcome challenges in the response to the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are having a positive impact, although the outbreak remains dangerous and unpredictable, the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping and the World Health Organization (WHO) said after a joint mission to assess the outbreak.

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix yesterday travelled with the Minister of Health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, to the city of Beni in eastern DRC, the epicentre of the outbreak, where they met health workers, civil society representatives, peacekeeping troops and local authorities.

The United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC, MONUSCO, has recently taken an active approach to armed groups operating in North Kivu, which has contributed to a period of calm in and around the city of Beni, although some attacks have continued in surrounding villages.

Under the leadership of the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners are also making greater use of community surveillance, in which community members are trained to conduct contact-tracing activities in areas that outsiders have difficulty accessing. This has contributed to a decline in new cases over the past 2 weeks, although the situation remains of grave concern.

MONUSCO has provided support to the Ebola response since the beginning of the outbreak through the provision of logistical support, office facilities, transportation, communication and security.

[Getting community members to feel vested through participation in control will help quell distrust and suspicion in the communities. Having community members trained to conduct contact tracing is a win-win proposition because they will be helping in the response and feeling proud to be part of the effort, plus serve as models for the rest of the community. - Mod.LK
