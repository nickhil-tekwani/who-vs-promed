MENINGOCOCCAL COMMUNITY OUTBREAK - ENGLAND (DERBYSHIRE)
=======================================================
Date: Wed, 12 Mar 1997 16:53:14 +0000
From: Dr Peter English <peng@sdhealth.demon.co.uk>

Here in Derbyshire (in the middle of England) we are treating a
"community outbreak" of meningitis.
There have been 5 cases of meningococcal disease over the last 3
months. " [sic] of them are group C (2aP1.5); another 3 cases were reported
in which no bacteriology was obtained (no growth from blood cultures
or CSF, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative. In one of these
cases gram negative diplococci were visible in the CSF: the other two
cases were clinical diagnoses only.
None of the patients has died, most have now recovered without
complications, and the final case is doing very well in hospital.
The community (as defined by geography and regular travel and
social mixing) being treated comprises the following EDs: Alfreton
East, Alfreton West, Somercotes, Swanwick, and Riddings.
Following recommendations published in the CDR
[Communicable Disease Reports, British Public Health Service]
recently, the number of
cases in the 0-18 year age range in the above community was
estimated. If the two cases alone in which the group was known were
used as the numerator, the number of cases just exceeded the 40 per
100,000 recommended as the cut-off point for launching a community
treatment programme.
Treatment will start tomorrow. The broadcast and published media are
being used to ask all 2-4 year olds who live in the area to go to the
community health clinic tomorrow -- surnames beginning A-M between
09:30 and 11:30, and surnames beginning N-Z between 14:30 and 16:30.
All children who live or attend school in the area will be treated at
school on Thursday or Friday (13-14 March 1997).
All 5-18 year olds who live in the area but who have left school, or
who do not attend schools in the area, are being asked to contact
their general practitioner (family doctor); and family doctors are
being asked to treat them.
The treatment used is:
Immunisation against meningococcus groups A and C;
Rifampicin for primary school age and younger children (aged
2-10 approx.);
Ciprofloxacin for secondary school-aged children (approx. 11-18).
