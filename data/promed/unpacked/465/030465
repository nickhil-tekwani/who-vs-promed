Local officials are reporting that 42 people have died, almost all of
them children, in an outbreak of a still unidentified disease in the
remote Nurum district of Panama's indigenous Ngobe-Bugle region.
The ailment begins with a runny nose, coughing, and fever, and when
it gets deadly the victims present symptoms that look like bronchial
pneumonia, according to a statement by Panama's Health Ministry.
The Health Ministry and the semi-autonomous Gorgas Memorial
Laboratory say they don't know the cause of the illness.
"We're studying it, and the Gorgas Lab is working on it, but to say
anything now would be speculation," said a ministry official who
asked for anonymity because he lacked authorization to comment on the case.
Federal government officials say they know of only 10 deaths, but
some of their comments on the case have been contradictory.
The information problem has been made worse by the difficulty in
getting to Nurum in central Veraguas province, where the dirt roads
become impassable to most vehicles in this, the rainy season. The
population in many cases lives a long walk from even those precarious roads.
Word of a problem 1st got out in mid-September [2007] when local
officials contacted the Health Ministry and then, alarmed by what
they considered a lackadaisical response, took their story to the news media.
On [23 Sep 2007] Gladys Guerrero, the ministry's director of
epidemiology, denied to a reporter for the tabloid El Siglo that
there was any viral or bacterial pathogen at work, attributing the
problem to complications of rainy season colds that are common in the
area, especially because of its poor sanitary conditions.
Guerrero also said that local claims at the time of 10 deaths since
late August [2007] were exaggerated. Within 5 days, Ngobe officials
were reporting 40 deaths and many more sick. The La Prensa newspaper
has reported that more than 30 children from Nurum are being treated
in various hospitals around the country.
The country's disease control center, the Gorgas Memorial Institute,
is working to identify the cause of the outbreak.
The Health Ministry said in a [29 Sep 2007] press release that the
problem appears to be "a known acute viral respiratory situation like
influenza," but on Monday [1 Oct 2007] a ministry spokesman said that
no flu or other virus had yet been identified.
The US government has offered help, but as of Tuesday [2 Oct 2007]
Panama had not asked for international assistance.
The Ngobe-Bugle district, the youngest of Panama's semi-autonomous
indigenous regions, comprises about 9 percent of the country's land
mass and has its biggest concentration of poverty. Many of the
inhabitants leave for part of the year to pick coffee or other crops.
The district, shared among its Ngobe majority and Bugle and other
minorities, is politically fractious and its self-governing
institutions are not as developed as in some other indigenous areas in Panama.
After news of the illness broke, President Martin Torrijos cut short
a trip to the United States and flew into Nurum with a team of some
60 healthcare workers.
Government officials fanned out to visit thousands of families and
advise them to cooperate with health officials and that nobody
evacuated to a city hospital would be left stranded -- a concern that
had led some of the poor parents to refuse to let their children be
taken to a hospital.

The Ministry of Health reports that during the integral health
operatives conducted in the Nurum district of the Ngobe-Bugle comarca
[county] during the period 20 to 30 Sep 2007, they have cared for
5000 patients coming from the areas of Agua de Salud, Guayabito,
Buenos Aires, El Bale, and the communities of Guibale, El Penon, and
Virigua. There is a permanent ministry presence in these areas and
they are continuing with activities, incorporating the communities of
Guabal, Valle Bonito, and others.
As of 30 Sep 2007, there were 48 patients in the regional hospital
Luis "Chicho" Fabrega, in the province of Veraguas, coming from the
district of Nurum, with acute respiratory syndromes. These were
primarily young children less than 5 years of age who as of the
stated date were in stable condition, and 14 of them had already been
discharged from the hospital.
Laboratory reports on studies conducted revealed the presence of a
respiratory virus, with a predominance of a type of adenovirus, for
which there is no vaccine, but whose early detection permits
management and effective treatment avoiding the onset of complications.
During the weekend [29-30 Sep 2007] 6 minors from Kankintu and
Kusapin with diarrheal disease and dehydration, were transferred to
the [county hospital] of Bocas del Toro province. These transfers
were done in a timely manner to prevent fatalities and an appropriate
epidemiologic investigation is being conducted.
The coordinated efforts of health professionals at the national,
regional, and local levels, with local authorities and the community
from the county of Ngobe Bugle, have provided valuable information,
achieving greater impact of the activities, which has prevented new
deaths from occurring and has permitted the handling of the current situation.
So far [1 Oct 2007] there have been 10 deaths officially reported
attributable to this respiratory syndrome. Nevertheless, the Ministry
of Health has given instructions for a detailed countrywide
epidemiologic investigation of all cases and deaths associated with
respiratory and diarrheal infections to be carried out in all of the
health regions and for the appropriate measures to be implemented.
Recommendations have been made for the entire population to closely
watch the children; those presenting with a clinical picture of
fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, should be brought to health
facilities. Personal cleanliness measures such as hand washing and
adequate handling of respiratory secretions are to be observed. In
addition, there should be care to avoid smoke, rain, cold, and
contact with other young children, avoiding gathering places.

[The clinical description provided in the newswire is consistent with
any number of respiratory pathogens including viral, bacterial,
fungal, and parasitic. Based on the newswire, one can't help but
speculate this might be a respiratory viral outbreak with a high
mortality often seen in rural hard-to-reach areas where access to
medical care is limited. Using the Global Infectious Disease and
Epidemiology Network (GIDEON -- <http://www.gideononline.com>), the
differential diagnosis (with probability of occurrence includes:
respiratory viruses - - miscellaneous (36.9 percent), influenza (31.3
percent), respiratory syncytial virus infection (20 percent),
parainfluenza virus infection (10.1 percent); then the remainder with
a less than one percent probability of occurrence include: pertussis,
adenovirus infection, laryngotracheobronchitis, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, enterovirus infection, measles, diphtheria, ornithosis,
_Chlamydophila pneumoniae_ infection, Q-fever, dengue, and
paracoccidioidomycosis.
That being said, the findings stated in the Ministry of Health (MOH)
press release in part [2] of an adenovirus, are not overly
surprising. One might postulate here that there is the ongoing
transmission of a respiratory virus (adenovirus) with probable
secondary bacterial infection among a remote, rural childhood
population where acute respiratory infections are a leading cause of
death. There is clearly a conflict of information provided in the
newswire when compared with the official MOH statement. The former
mentions reports of 40 deaths, compared with the MOH reports of 10
deaths. Clarification of the situation from knowledgeable sources
would be greatly appreciated.
For background information: "Ngobe-Bugle is a comarca (roughly,
"county" though signifying a high degree of administrative autonomy)
in Panama. It was formed in 1997 with lands from the provinces of
Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, and Veraguas. The capital is Chichica.
Ngobe-Bugle has a population of 169 130 mainly Guaymi (Ngobe and
Bugle). They are actually 2 different groups: the Ngobes and the
Bugles. The Ngobes speak Ngabere and the Bugles speak Buglere. The
comarca is divided into 7 districts." Nurum is one of the districts
and its capital is Buenos Aires. For a map of the comarca and further
links on the region, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ng%C3%B6be-Bugl%C3%A9>)
