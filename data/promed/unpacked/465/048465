[A] rare soybean disease, tobacco ringspot virus [TRSV], has appeared in Indiana. The disease is hard to miss in a field. Infected plants have few pods. They stay green longer because there are virtually no beans for the plant to feed sugars to, so sugars remain in stems. A few pods may have one or more beans in them. They seldom mature, however.

Darcy Telenko, Purdue University, indicated that she hasn't seen the disease very often. TRSV can be transmitted through infected seed and by insect feeding. Perhaps that's the key to why it appeared in 2019, especially in southern Indiana: it tends to be favored by hot, dry weather. Those conditions dominated the latter part of the season in much of the state until a late September [2019] storm brought rain to the northern 1/3 of the state.

Rotation to corn can help control the disease, Telenko notes. You also want to make sure you're buying clean seed.

[_Tobacco ringspot virus_ (TRSV) is the type member of genus _Nepovirus_. The name indicates that, generally, members of the genus are transmitted by nematodes. TRSV has a wide host range, including herbaceous as well as woody species. Symptoms vary with hosts and virus strain. Several TRSV strains can infect soybean, and symptoms on this host may include terminal distortion of shoots ("shepherd's crook"); spots, distortion, proliferations, and necrosis on leaves and buds; stunting and wilting of plants; delayed maturity; and reduced number of pods. The highest yield losses of up to 100% have been reported if infection occurs before flowering as bud blight.

TRSV can be easily transmitted by plant sap, such as on agricultural equipment. The virus is also seed transmitted at a rate depending on the host and timing of infection. Systemically infected soybean plants often produce infected seeds, which are the main source of virus carry-over to the next cropping season. Natural vectors of the virus are adults and larvae of dagger nematodes (_Xiphinema_ species), but the efficiency of these vectors is low in soybean. Local spread of TRSV in soybean cultures has been reported to be mainly by insects, including some aphid species and thrips. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of certified clean seeds. A number of soybean cultivars appear to have some resistance to some of the virus strains.
