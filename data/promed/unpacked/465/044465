The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (1 Dec 2022) said that it is following up on 3 probable cases of botulism after receiving injections of botulinum toxin at a beauty premises earlier. People who have received botulinum toxin injections at CC Beauty, located in Hang Bong Commercial Centre, 28 Shanghai Street, Jordan, and presented with botulism symptoms, are urged to contact the CHP as soon as possible.

The CHP has set up an enquiry hotline (2125 2372) for the related botulism cases, which operates from 9am to 5:30pm starting today [1 Dec 2022]. Persons who presented with symptoms of neurological system impairment such as drooping eyelids, double vision or blurred vision, problems with chewing, hoarseness, difficulties in swallowing, speaking or breathing after receiving injections at the above premises, should call the hotline immediately. Officers of the CHP will assess their condition and arrange for a follow-up as appropriate.

Due to the weakening of associated muscles and the fact that botulinum toxin may spread and affect other areas beyond the injection site, affected patients may present with the above-mentioned symptoms, which may happen hours, days or weeks after the injection. The CHP reminded members of the public to seek medical attention should they have urgent medical needs.

"Botulinum toxin injections should only be performed by a locally registered doctor. Customers should understand the identity of the service provider and browse the list of registered medical practitioners of the Medical Council of Hong Kong as well as his or her professional qualifications and relevant experience," a spokesman for the DH said.

The DH urged the public to observe the health advice below before receiving botulinum toxin injections:

- Injections should only be performed by locally registered doctors;
- Understand the procedure, potential risks and complications before receiving injections. Consult a doctor for an informed decision;
- Do not receive an injection in the case of a history of allergy to botulinum toxin, or infection or inflammation on the injection site;
- Request the full name of the doctor in writing if referred by a beauty service provider for the procedure, as well as the professional qualifications and relevant experience; and
- If symptoms develop, such as fever or feeling unwell, seek medical attention immediately.

The public may visit the DH's webpage on the differentiation between medical procedures and beauty services, the Drug Database of the Drug Office and the CHP's botulism page for more information.

[Jordan is an area in Hong Kong, located on Kowloon Peninsula. It is named after a road of the same name in the district.

At least a dozen cases of systemic botulism from the cosmetic use of botulism toxin were reported in 2016 from Hong Kong, most acquired from injections done on the mainland.

A 2008 petition to have a black box warning on botulinum toxin for injection (https://www.citizen.org/our-work/health-and-safety/petition-requesting-regulatory-action-concerning-spread) was reproduced in a previous ProMED post (Botulism, cosmetic use - China: (Hong Kong) 20210908.8654975). It documents systemic effects and deaths from these injections in the United States. The citations can be found at the original URL. - Mod.LL
