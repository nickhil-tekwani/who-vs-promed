An updated country-wide list of infected zones has been published today [12 Apr 2012] by the Veterinary Services.

The village Zavdiel is not included any longer in the list of avian-influenza infected locations; however, it now appears in the list of Newcastle disease-infected villages.

[Turkey poults in Zavdiel (Hadarom/south) were suspected on 30 Mar 2012 to be infected with H5N1 due to positive real time PCR test; however, they did not show clinical signs of disease (see 20120331.1086593).

As it now appears, the initial diagnosis could not be confirmed; no AI virus could be isolated from the original samples or from additional samples. In case additional explanatory data are available, they will be appreciated.

Earlier during 2012, Israel submitted reports to the OIE on the 2 following separate events:

1. The 1st event, involving 2 turkey farms in 2 separate locations within Hadarom (south) district, started on 7 Mar 2012, was confirmed as HPAI H5N1 on 8 Mar 2012, and was reported on 9 Mar 2012. This outbreak, addressed by stamping out, was announced as "resolved" on 25 Mar 2012. See, with map, at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11725.

2. The 2nd event involved stray cats in one of the 2 villages affected during the 1st event (Shalva). The cats were clinically suspected on 13 Mar 2012, were confirmed on 14 Mar 2012, and were reported on 15 Mar 2012. The reason for notification was given as "Change in epidemiology."

On 15 Apr 2012, Israel's CVO submitted "Follow-up report No. 2 (Final report)" addressing the said outbreak in cats. It included the following epidemiological comments:

"Cats were seen eating infected carcasses of turkeys. Clinical signs appeared on them about one week later. The virus found in the cats was similar to the virus found in the turkeys of Shalva.

"On 21 Mar 2012, active monitoring was carried out in 15 cats caught in several parts of the village. All of them were found negative. Two more cats (one dead and one sick), which were picked up near the affected pen of turkeys, were found positive. Further monitoring of the cats in the village was applied on 1 Apr 2012. 20 cats were caught and were found negative to H5N1."
