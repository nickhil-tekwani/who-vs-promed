The [etiology of the illness] of more than 200 milk cows in a
Liaoning Province village is still unknown, though farmers have
reported the cases to the Ministry of Agriculture twice in the last
12 days, the China Business News said today [7 Feb 2006].

"We did receive 2 reports. We ordered the Liaoning agricultural
authorities to investigate the reports but found nothing," the
newspaper quoted an official of the ministry's veterinary bureau as
saying. "We will order the Liaoning authorities to probe it once
more."
Liu Jianhua, a villager of Liangjia Village in Kangping County,
reported the 1st case to the local epidemic prevention station on 8
Jan 2006, after he found some of the milk cows raised by his neighbor
excessively salivating and having blisters on their breast skin.
The station said they would report the case to higher-level
authorities after sending personnel to check on the sick cows, Liu
said.
On the morning of 17 Jan 2006, Liu found 2 of his milk cows suffering
from the same symptoms. He called the epidemic prevention station
again to report it. Half an hour later, the station director came to
the Lius, and discovered the cows had fever of 40.3 degrees Celsius.
The station said they would have it reported to their seniors.
Later that afternoon, 5 people from the county's veterinary authority
came to the Lius, but failed to do tests because their blisters had
broken.
As of 19 Jan 2006, 6 cows of Lius were infected and unable to produce
milk. The authorities said Liu could get only 1200 yuan (USD149) for
each cow, if culling the sick cows, Liu said.
On 23 Jan 2006, a team headed by the epidemic prevention station
director came to the Village of Liangjia, distributed a batch of
disinfection [materials] to each milk cow farmer, and vaccinated all
of the milk cows in the village to prevent foot-and-mouth disease.
Liaoning's veterinary authorities said the outbreak in Liangjia
Village was an ordinary epidemic rather than FMD, according to the
China Business News [See commentary].
Liu said he has yet to get any idea of the disease [?], though it has
been nearly one month since he reported the first case. He wanted to
sell his milk cows, but wasn't allowed. So for now he still has to
pay for the 10-yuan daily cost to feed his cows.
In Liangjia Village, 26 families raised milk cows. Now 70 percent of
the village's 300 milk cows are suffering from the disease.
FMD does not harm humans, but it is dangerous to animals, the News
said, citing Yu Kangzhen, the vice director of China's general
veterinary station. If the disease is confirmed, the sick cows must
be culled, and trade should be banned absolutely, he said.

[Since the beginning of 2005, FMD (serotype Asia 1) was officially
reported from 5 (out of China's 22) provinces (Shandong, Gansu,
Qinghai, Hebei and Jiangxi), in 2 out of China's 5 autonomous regions
(Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia) and in one out of China's 4 major
municipalities (Beijing). In view of the multiple recurring outbreaks
in neighbouring countries -- adjacent to their frontiers with China
-- it may be assumed that the disease is rather endemic in larger if
not all parts of China; in other words, "an ordinary epidemic", if
the first part only of Liaoning's veterinary authorities' statement
in the above press item may be cited. See also FAO's review, June
2005 (20050624.1774).
China's last follow-up report on FMD to the OIE was sent on 16 Jan
2006; see <http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_35.HTM#Sec3>. An
official report on the current event, which -- based upon the above
described details -- is highly suspected to be an FMD outbreak, is
anticipated.
Culling infected animals in an endemic country is not justifiable;
mass vaccinations, combined with animal movement control backed by
assiduous animal identification, should be the preferred policy in
this situation.
Periodically, repeatedly vaccinating all of China's susceptible
livestock (large and small ruminants, pigs) is a gigantic
undertaking. In this respect, it is interesting to note that Chinese
scientists are engaged in efforts to develop synthetic peptide
vaccine which, if combined with transgenic crops, could be used in
feed for mass immunization. (see
<http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=108714>).
Should this (utopian?) scenario -- an oral (through feed or drinking
water) FMD vaccination developed, tested and proven effective -- be
realised, then controlling the disease in China, as well as in other
endemic areas, might become feasible. For instance, for the so-far
unachievable mass vaccination of the extensive small ruminant
populations of the Middle East and North Africa. - Mod.AS]
