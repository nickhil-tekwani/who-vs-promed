The Zhejiang Province, China Center for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting an outbreak of psittacosis, aka parrot fever, in Lishui City, according to Chinese media. Since the 1st cases were reported 1 month ago, a total of 7 cases have been reported, including 1 individual still hospitalized and 1 fatality. An investigation and surveillance into the outbreak have been instituted and no additional cases have been detected.

The provincial and municipal CDCs jointly carried out external environmental (bird swabs, feces, and related pollutants) specimens monitoring, collected 74 specimens and 6 were positive for _Chlamydophila psittaci_, the agent of psittacosis. The local CDC cooperated with the agricultural department immediately culling the poultry in the case's home and carry out comprehensive disinfection of the case's residence, poultry house, poultry free-range breeding ground and other related places, and strengthen the publicity and education of villagers' psittacosis prevention knowledge.

Psittacosis is a disease caused by [a bacterium] called _C. psittaci_. It is usually transmitted by inhaling the agent from dried droppings or secretions of infected birds. Patients with psittacosis usually present fever, headache, rash, muscle pain, chills, and dry cough. Pneumonia may sometimes occur, and occasional complications include encephalitis, myocarditis, and thrombophlebitis. The disease can be treated effectively with antimicrobials and is not normally transmitted from person to person.

[No information is given above regarding the epidemiology, the specific birds implicated (although poultry is mentioned), or the range of symptoms in those people affected.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection, in general, is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing. People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL
