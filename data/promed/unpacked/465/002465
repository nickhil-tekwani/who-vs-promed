NWHC QUARTERLY WILDLIFE MORTALITY REPORT
========================================

The following highlights wildlife mortality reported
to the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) from October
through December, 1995. Twenty nine die-offs were reported
to NWHC this quarter.
As is typical for this time of year, avian cholera
epizootics accounted for the greatest losses. The largest
die-off occurred at the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge
Complex in California and involved over 5,000 waterfowl.
Mortality began at Butte Sink NWR in early November and
later in the year occurred on the other Sacramento Complex
refuges (Colusa, Delevan, Sutter, Sacramento River, and
Sacramento). Mortality continued into early February.
NWHC research personnel have been on site collecting
environmental data as part of an avian cholera research
project.
Avian cholera also caused the death of an
estimated 1,000 eared grebes and Canada geese using the
Great Salt Lake in Utah. Avian cholera occurred for the
first time on this area last year with losses estimated at
10,000 eared grebes and ruddy ducks. In Scotts Bluff
County, Nebraska, approximately 800 waterfowl, primarily
mallards, died on an open creek and a nearby ten acre pond.
Low level mortality is ongoing. This site is within 1/2
mile of an area where avian cholera occurred in 1985. Avian
cholera mortality has not been reported again until this
year.
Conjunctivitis in house finches continued in several Eastern
states this quarter. Sick birds were reported from a new
location in Kenton County, Kentucky. At that site,
approximately 50% of the birds visiting a backyard feeder
were noted with red, crusty eyes. A single bird that was
collected and necropsied, s howed lesions typical of the
conjunctivitis in house finches from previously documented
sites. Mycoplasma cultures were positive, however, the
fragile organism could not be maintained so typing was not
possible.
Lead poisoning caused the death of an estimated 60 waterfowl
in Lassen County, California. The area consists of flooded
rice and alfalfa fields. It is speculated that the source
of the lead was from lead shot spent in blackbird control
operations.
An estimated 1000 Northern fulmars died along the Pacific
coasts of Washington and Oregon. The mortality estimates
were based on shoreline surveys and with much of the
shoreline inacces sible in this area, the estimate is crude.
The definitive cause of mortality is not yet known but
diagnostic testing is ongoing. So far there is no evidence
that infectious or toxic diseases played a role in the
event. It is no t uncommon to find groups of dead fulmars
and other seabirds following storm events in the months of
November and December, however, the magnitude of the
mortality in fulmars this year is unusual.
Aspergillosis was determined to be the cause of death for an
estimated 750 mallards found along a one mile stretch of
Winters Creek in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. Mallards were found
in a similar condition 2.5 miles away on Lake Minatare. As
many as 27 bald eagles were seen feeding on the carcasses
which, in conjunction with the poor ice conditions,
hampered collection.
Renal coccidiosis was determined to be the cause of death
for 136 double-crested cormorants in Runnells Bottoms,
Marion County, Iowa. This is the first time this disease
has been reported in Iowa and it has only been documented
six times (1-NE; 1-MN; 5-KS) previously in double-crested
cormorants. Since the 1992 Newcastle outbreak, cormorant
mortality has been monitored closely.
Specific and detailed information on these and other
mortality events can be found at the NWHC WWW Homepage at

printed report. This information is also included in the
Supplements to the Journal of Wildlife Diseases.
