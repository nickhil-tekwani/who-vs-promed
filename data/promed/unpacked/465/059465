Joint USDA And DOI News Release: Avian Influenza Tests Complete On
Wild Mallard Ducks In Pennsylvania
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior today announced
final test results, which confirm that low pathogenic H5N1 avian
influenza virus was found in samples collected last month [August
2006] from wild mallard ducks in Pennsylvania. This subtype has been
detected several times in wild birds in North America and poses no
risk to human health.
The USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirmed
the presence of the "North American strain" of low pathogenic H5N1
avian influenza through virus isolation in one of the 15 samples
collected from the wild mallards in Crawford County, Pennsylvania.
Initial screening results announced on 2 Sep indicated that an H5N1
avian influenza subtype was present in the collected samples, but
further testing was necessary to confirm pathogenicity. As previously
announced, genetic testing ruled out the possibility that the samples
carried the specific highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 avian influenza
that is circulating overseas.
Low pathogenic strains of avian influenza commonly occur in wild
birds and typically cause only minor sickness or no noticeable signs
of disease in birds. Low pathogenic H5N1 is very different from the
more severe highly pathogenic H5N1 circulating in parts of Asia,
Europe and Africa. Highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza
spread rapidly and are often fatal to chickens and turkeys.
The Departments of Agriculture and Interior are working
collaboratively with States and academic institutions to sample wild
birds throughout the United States for the presence of highly
pathogenic avian influenza.
