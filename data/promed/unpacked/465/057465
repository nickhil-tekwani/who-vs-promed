Researchers have discovered a new, more aggressive strain of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that develops into AIDS much more quickly than other strains, Medical News Today reported. In a new study published in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, scientists detailed the new strain as a "recombinant" virus -- a hybrid of 2 virus strains. Called A3/02 -- a cross between the 02AG and A3 viruses -- the strain can develop into AIDS in just 5 years after 1st infection -- one of the shortest time periods for HIV-1 types.

"Recombinants seem to be more vigorous and more aggressive than the strains from which they [originated]," said 1st author Angelica Palm, a doctoral candidate at Lund University in Sweden.

So far, the A3/02 strain has only been seen in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, but other studies have shown that recombinants are spreading more quickly across the globe. "HIV is an extremely dynamic and variable virus. New subtypes and recombinant forms of HIV-1 have been introduced to our part of the world, and it is highly likely that there are a large number of circulating recombinants of which we know little or nothing," said senior author Patrik Medstran, professor of clinical virology at Lund University. "We therefore need to be aware of how the HIV-1 epidemic changes over time."

Abstract
--------
Background: Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is divided into subtypes and circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) but the impact of subtype/CRF on disease progression is not fully understood.

Methods: We determined the HIV-1 subtype/CRF of 152 seroincident individuals from Guinea-Bissau, based on the C2-V3 region of _env_. Disease progression was measured as time from estimated seroconversion to AIDS and AIDS-related death. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazard model, adjusting for gender and age at seroconversion.

Results: The major subtypes/CRFs identified were CRF02_AG (53 percent), A3 (29 percent), and A3/02 (a recombinant of A3 and CRF02_AG) (13 percent). Infection with A3/02 was associated with a close to 3-fold increased risk of AIDS and AIDS-related death compared to A3 (HR = 2.6 [P = 0.011] and 2.9 [P= 0.032], respectively). The estimated time from seroconversion to AIDS and AIDS-related death was 5.0 and 8.0 years for A3/02, 6.2 and 9.0 years for CRF02_AG, and 7.2 and 11.3 years for A3.

Conclusion: Our results show that there are differences in disease progression between HIV-1 A-like subtypes/CRFs. Individuals infected with A3/02 have among the fastest progression rates to AIDS reported to date. Determining the HIV-1 subtype of infected individuals could be important in the management of HIV-1 infections.
