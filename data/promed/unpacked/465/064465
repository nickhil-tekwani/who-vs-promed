[The island of Vis, where the BTV-4 outbreak above has been recorded, is situated in the Adriatic Sea, about 40 km (25 mi) from Croatia's coast. See map at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/europe/croatia_pol01.jpg.

According to information from European countries submitted to the OIE during the week 15 Sep-1 Oct 2015, BTV has reportedly been circulating in France (BTV 8), Romania (BTV-4), Hungary (serotyping pending), and Croatia (BTV-4). Following are the respective country summary reports, each with a map showing all accumulated outbreaks since the start of the country's epizootic, as well as links to each follow-up report (in parentheses, accumulated number of outbreaks as of 1 Oct 2015):

France (33) http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18642,
Hungary (10) http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18625,
Romania (13) http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18601,
Croatia (1) http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=18764.

Results of the serotyping of the Hungarian BTV strain, initially confirmed on 9 Sep 2015, reportedly affecting cattle only (29 cases out of 1682 susceptible animals, clinical signs not described) would be helpful.

Genotyping results of the BTV-8 strain in France are similarly anticipated with interest. - Mods.AS/CRD]
