Event started on 10 Jan 2022 and was confirmed on 14 Jan 2022. A total of one outbreak (submitted) has been reported to date [14 Jan 2022]. HPAI subtype H5N1 was detected in a backyard holding in settlement Branjin Vrh, municipality of Beli Manastir, county of Osjecko-Baranjska.

Affected population: Holdings with 40 laying hens, 3 ducks and 9 ornamental pigeons.

Epidemiological comments: On the holding with total 52 mixed species of poultry, 13 animals died. Five carcasses were sampled and tested and influenza A virus, subtype H5N1 was confirmed on 14 Jan 2022, on 12 Jan 2022 and on 13 Jan 2022. Establishment is located near the water surfaces in settlement Branjin Vrh, municipality Beli Manastir. Contact with wild birds cannot be excluded. Preventive culling of all poultry on the affected establishment is implemented. Implementation of disease control measures according to the Delegated Regulation 2020/687 as well as epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Event started on 6 Jan 2022. A total of one outbreak (submitted) has been reported to date [14 Jan 2022], located in Stoholm, Viborg. The municipality of Viborg is located in the Central Jutland region.

On 6 Jan 2022, a clinical suspicion (increased mortality) was reported to the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration. The population of the holding consist of approximately 100 000 laying hens for egg consumption. On 7 Jan 2022, highly pathogenic avian influenza (subtype H5N8) was confirmed by the national reference laboratory. The culling of all susceptible animals at the holding was completed on 8 Jan 2022. The cleaning and disinfection were approved by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration on 11 Jan 2022.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has established zones of 3 and 10 km [1.8 and 6.2 mi] around the holding and is implementing the necessary measures in accordance with the European Union Animal Health Law. Note: The date of last occurrence of the H5N8 strain in poultry birds in Denmark is 7 Jul 2021.

Event started on 22 Dec 2021. A total of one outbreak (submitted) has been reported to date [14 Jan 2022]. HPAI H5N1 has been detected in a white stork (_Ciconia ciconia_) and 4 mute swans (_Cygnus olor_). The birds were found dead in Soses, municipality of Segria (Lleida), province of Lleida, community of Cataluña.

Epidemiological comments: Swab samples from the birds found dead were sent for analysis to the IRTA-CReSA laboratory, where positive results were obtained by PCR for avian influenza virus subtype H5. These results were confirmed by the national reference laboratory for avian influenza in Spain (LCV of Algete), determining that it was an HPAI H5N1 strain.

Abstract
--------
"Between 16 Sep 2021 and 8 Dec 2021, 867 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections were reported in 27 EU/EEA countries and the UK in poultry (316), in wild (523) and in captive birds (28). The detections in poultry were mainly reported by Italy (167) followed by Hungary and Poland (35 each). The majority of the detections in wild birds were reported by Germany (280), Netherlands (65) and United Kingdom (53). The observed persistence and continuous circulation of HPAI viruses in migratory and resident wild birds will continue to pose a risk for the poultry industry in Europe for the coming months. The frequent occurrence of HPAI A(H5) incursions in commercial farms (including poultry production types considered at low avian influenza risk) raises concern about the capacity of the applied biosecurity measures to prevent virus introduction. Short-term preparedness and medium- and long-term prevention strategies, including revising and reinforcing biosecurity measures, reduction of the density of commercial poultry farms and possible appropriate vaccination strategies, should be implemented. The results of the genetic analysis indicate that the viruses characterised during this reporting period belong to clade 2.3.4.4b. Some of the characterized HPAI A(H5N1) viruses detected in Sweden, Germany, Poland and United Kingdom are related to the viruses which have been circulating in Europe since October 2020; in North, Central, South and East Europe novel reassortant A(H5N1) virus has been introduced starting from October 2021. HPAI A(H5N1) was also detected in wild mammal species in Sweden, Estonia and Finland; some of these strains characterised so far present an adaptive marker that is associated with increased virulence and replication in mammals. Since the last report, 13 human infections due to HPAI A(H5N6) and 2 human cases due to LPAI A(H9N2) virus have been reported from China. Some of these A(H5N6) cases were caused by a reassortant virus of clade 2.3.4.4b, which possessed an HA gene closely related to the A(H5) viruses circulating in Europe. The risk of infection for the general population in the EU/EEA is assessed as low, and for occupationally exposed people, low to medium, with large uncertainty due to the high diversity of circulating viruses in the bird populations."
