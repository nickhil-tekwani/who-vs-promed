Most cases of leptospirosis in Iloilo province involve farmworkers, according to the Provincial Health Office [PHO]. They may have been infected because they waded in contaminated water in farms.

The Provincial Health Office (PHO) recorded 88 leptospirosis cases with 9 deaths since January [2018], 283 percent higher than the cases recorded in the same period last year [2017]. There were 23 recorded leptospirosis cases from 1 Jan to 18 Aug 2017, PHO records showed.

The 5 municipalities with the most cases were the following: Oton - 10 cases with 3 deaths; Pototan - 9 cases; Cabatuan - 8 cases with 1 death; Alimodian - 6 cases with 1 death; and Maasin - 6 cases. The 4 other leptospirosis-related deaths were in the towns of Lambunao, Dumangas, Santa Barbara, and Concepcion.

According to Dr. Patricia Grace Trabado, PHO chief, most of the leptospirosis cases were from Iloilo's central towns that have large swathes of rice fields, and most of those infected were farmworkers. "They were from rice-producing municipalities and may have gotten leptospirosis from contaminated water," said Trabado.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease. One becomes infected through direct contact with the urine of infected animals or with a urine-contaminated environment. The bacteria enter the body through cuts or abrasions on the skin or through the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes.

In the early stages of the disease, symptoms include high fever, severe headache, muscle pain, chills, redness of the eyes, abdominal pain, jaundice, hemorrhages in the skin and mucous membranes, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash.

The Department of Health listed the following leptospirosis prevention and control measures: Avoid swimming or wading in potentially contaminated water or floodwater; Use of proper protection like boots and gloves when work requires exposure to contaminated water; Drain potentially contaminated water when possible; and Control rats in the household by using rat traps or rat poison, maintaining cleanliness in the house.

Trabado said that people with cuts or open wounds who have waded in rice fields or floodwaters should see a doctor immediately.

[Leptospirosis is an infection transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. The spirochete _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. The rainy season the Philippines is June through October; typhoons usually hit in September and October (https://www.withlocals.com/locations/philippines/climate/).

Five typhoons have occurred so far in August through September 2018; one typhoon spanned both July and August 2018, and only 2 typhoons occurred in the prior 6 months of 2018 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Pacific_typhoon_season).

The province of Iloilo, with a population of almost 2 million residents in 2015, occupies the southeast portion of Panay Island in the region of Western Visayas in the Philippines.
