Since [1 Aug 2017], the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 1851 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since [1 Aug 2017], primarily among homeless people and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

The DPH is working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 22 Sep 2018:
- Total outbreak: 1851
- Hospitalizations: 1029
- Deaths: 14

Since March 2018, the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health has reported an increase in the number of confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A virus. This increase in cases has primarily been among injecting and non-injecting drug users, homeless or mobile individuals, and those who have been recently incarcerated. Viral sequencing has linked cases from Kentucky and California.

Those affected the most are the marginalized cohorts of humanity, including homeless people and substance abusers. Their needs for adequate sanitation and living conditions were supplied in the San Diego (California) area, and such an approach to these outbreaks is required elsewhere in the USA. Spillover into other portions of the population, such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers, will continue. It is not clear how many of these rapidly increasing cases are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

Kentucky remains in 1st place in cases. West Virginia has roared past California and Michigan for 2nd on the HAV case number list. With the 1395 number in West Virginia and Kentucky's 1851, these 2 states have reported 3246 cases. In the entire year of 2016 (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2016surveillance/index.htm). CDC reported only 2007 cases from all 50 states. Based on weekly numbers, 140 new cases were reported from these 2 states. There is no clear sign of decreasing numbers. It is not entirely clear what public health responses are occurring. - Mod.LL

A Cheektowaga [Erie county] restaurant is responsible for 4 cases of hepatitis A, county officials announced today, 1 Oct 2018, as they highlighted a spike in the number of cases of the viral infection. A cook employed at Doino's Pizzeria Bar & Grille at 2709 Harlem Road, Cheektowaga, tested positive for hepatitis A but did not initially tell the county Department of Health about his employment there, said county executive Mark Poloncarz.

Anyone who ate the restaurant's food between 20 Aug 2018 and 3 Sep 2018 could have been exposed to the hepatitis virus, said Poloncarz, who added that the county is "closely monitoring the situation". Erie county is seeing 5 times as many cases in 2018 of hepatitis A, which affects the liver. Though numbers are small -- 20 cases have been reported so far in 2018 to the county health department -- that's a sharp increase from the 2 to 4 cases that are usually reported each year.

Hepatitis A is typically transmitted when people eat or drink things that have been contaminated by small amounts of feces from someone already infected with hepatitis A, or in some cases, sex with someone who is infected. This disease is commoner in developing countries with poor sanitation and is not transmitted through casual contact. Children have been routinely vaccinated against hepatitis A since 1994.

Because the infected cook at Doino's did not inform the health department about working at the restaurant until health officials followed up with him 3 weeks later, it is too late for emergency vaccinations to do any good to exposed patrons who ate Doino's in August and early September [2018], said health commissioner Gale Burstein. She added that while not everyone who contracts hepatitis A develops symptoms, anyone who could develop symptoms as a result of eating at Doino's would show signs of the illness by 23 Oct 2018 at the latest.

Health Department sanitarians who inspected the restaurant [Wed 26 Sep 2018, also found 3 "noncritical" violations, including inadequate handwashing facilities, insufficient ventilation, and fruit flies at the bar, Burstein said. All 3 violations are being addressed. She said an exterminator is being hired. In addition, other employees working at the restaurant who had no symptoms of hepatitis have been vaccinated.

The last time the county reported a hepatitis A scare was in February 2018, when a food prep worker at Lancaster restaurant Al-E-Oops and the Brookdale Williamsville Senior Living Facility was diagnosed with the virus. Burstein pointed out that the increase in hepatitis A cases is happening across the country, with larger outbreaks in Michigan and California [although Kentucky and West Virginia have surged way past these 2 states - Mod.LL]. She urged all residents who have not received the hepatitis vaccine to get it. "This is a vaccine-preventable disease," she said.

[It is not clearly stated what the time line of the cases was here, which would be useful in determining whether the food handler was the source of the other cases. This is another reminder that, in the same way that healthcare workers are vaccinated against certain diseases to help protect their patients, food handlers should be vaccinated against HAV to protect the public. Since HAV is heat labile, pizza is not a common vehicle unless some ingredients, such as salad, are added after cooking. - Mod.LL
