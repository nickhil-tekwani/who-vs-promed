Researchers link longer MERS incubation to lower risk of death
--------------------------------------------------------------
Having a longer incubation period -- the time from virus exposure to disease -- was tied to a lower risk of death in MERS-CoV patients in South Korea, according to a study yesterday [1 Dec 2015] in [the journal] Emerging Infectious Diseases [see reference below].

French and Hong Kong researchers analyzed data on 170 cases of MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection, of which exposure data were available for 109.

They found that the incubation period was 6.4 days for patients who died, compared with 7.1 days for those who survived. They calculated that the risk of death dropped 17 percent for every additional day of incubation period.

The investigators wrote that they found a similar correspondence with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) in an earlier study. SARS is also caused by a coronavirus.

"Abstract. We analyzed data for 170 patients in South Korea who had laboratory-confirmed infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. A longer incubation period was associated with a reduction in the risk for death (adjusted odds ratio/1-day increase in incubation period 0.83, 95 percent credibility interval 0.68-1.03)."

The authors proposed the hypothesis for their finding that "a shorter incubation period could be related to a higher initial infective dose and consequently to faster or greater pathogen replication. This finding could lead to a more severe disease induced by more aggressive and damaging inflammatory responses [Ho M-S, Chen W-J, Chen H-Y, et al: Neutralizing antibody response and SARS severity. Emerg Infect Dis. 2005; 11(11): 1730-7; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367364/]. Closer monitoring of patients who have a shorter incubation period could be considered during such outbreaks.

Another potential explanation for our findings is that patients with longer incubation periods were identified and infection confirmed more quickly. This improvement in time to identification and admission to a hospital led to improved prognosis. ... -- more"

Although the study has limitations, it is a good epidemiologic approach to understanding mortality following infection.
