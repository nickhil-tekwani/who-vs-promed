Swiss authorities have identified 2 cases of bird flu in waterfowl in the Lake Geneva area. This follows the detection of the virus in ducks around Lake Constance (Bodensee) last week.

On Saturday [12 Nov 2016], the Swiss Federal Office of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs confirmed that a dead tufted duck and a laughing gull found near the port of the city of Lausanne [Vaud canton] have tested positive for bird flu. Like the cases in Lake Constance, the 2 birds were found to harbour the H5N8 strain of the virus.

Authorities have called for a poultry exclusion zone of 1 km from the shoreline of all major Swiss lakes to prevent contact with wild and migratory waterfowl. Poultry owners that cannot comply with this are required to confine their birds in watertight enclosures.

The Federal Office of Food Safety and Veterinary Affairs will modify existing regulations next week and could further strengthen preventive measures depending on how the situation evolves over the next couple of days. So far, no poultry farm has been infected.

People who come across dead wild birds are advised not to touch them and to inform the wildlife wardens or the cantonal police. According to latest research, the H5N8 bird flu strain cannot be transmitted from animals to humans.

[This finding is indicative of a spread westwards of the virus; Lake Geneva is shared between Switzerland and France.

France has, as yet, not reported any case of the emerging HPAI H5N8 virus, which reportedly already circulates in 3 continents. - Mod.AS

A poultry bird in Bellary district of Karnataka was tested positive for bird flu virus H5N8 and the state government has been asked to take steps to prevent spread of the disease, the Union government said today [11 Nov 2016]. There are no further reports of mortality from any part of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, where post-operation surveillance is going on, it noted.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), avian influenza virus H5N8, also known as bird flu, is considered to be less risky of being transmitted to humans. "The mortality was reported of poultry bird (chicken) in Itagi village, Hospet taluk of Bellary district in Karnataka," the Union Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.

Yesterday [Thu 10 Nov 2016], Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) confirmed that the samples are positive for H5N8 avian influenza virus, it said. The Karnataka government has been given directions to initiate control and containment operations. An officer from the Southern Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Bengaluru has been deputed to Bellary to oversee the operation and assist the state government.

The Ministry said that the control and containment operations are being carried out at various epicenters in Kerala. "The situation is under control. There is no further report of mortality from any part of Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana, where post-operation surveillance is going on," it added.

Samples sent from Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Gwalior (MP), Madipur (Delhi) and Rohtak (Haryana) have tested negative for avian influenza.
