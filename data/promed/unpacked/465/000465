Agriculture Victoria has confirmed positive detections of Japanese encephalitis virus at 4 new Victorian piggeries. These detections were found in the Campaspe, Loddon, Gannawarra, and Northern Grampians shires. This is in addition to the previous detections in Loddon, Campaspe, Wangaratta, Gannawarra, Greater Shepparton, and Greater Bendigo.

Japanese encephalitis virus has also been confirmed in piggeries in New South Wales, Queensland, and South Australia.

Agriculture Victoria said its incident management team was continuing to work closely with industry, conducting surveillance activities, and providing advice and information to farmers, livestock, and horse owners.

The virus is primarily spread by mosquitoes feeding on infected animals and does not usually spread directly from animal to animal (that is, it is not considered contagious).

Infection is not spread directly from pigs to people, and there is no risk to humans from eating pig meat.

In general, spread is through the movement of migratory waterbirds and the movement of infected mosquitoes, often over long distances.

People residing in or planning to visit the Murray River area should be aware of the risk of JEV and should take steps to significantly limit their exposure to mosquitoes.

There are simple steps to protect themselves and their families against mosquito-borne diseases:
- Wear long, loose-fitting clothes outdoors.
- Use effective mosquito repellents containing picaridin or DEET on all exposed skin.
- Try to limit outdoor activity if lots of mosquitoes are about.
- Use 'knockdown' fly sprays and plug-in repellent devices indoors.
- Sleep under mosquito nets treated with insecticides if you don't have flywire screens on windows on your home or are sleeping in an untreated tent or out in the open.
- Mosquito coils can be effective in small outdoor areas where you gather to sit or eat.

A vaccination program targeting those most at risk will commence shortly.

[Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) continues to spread in eastern Australia, this time to 4 new piggeries. Fortunately, the report above does not mention additional human cases. The comment is encouraging that a vaccination program targeting those most at risk will commence shortly.

Meanwhile, surveillance of piggeries and collaboration between the pig producers, livestock owners, and the agriculture incident management team will surely continue. It would be interesting to know if vector mosquito testing for JEV is part of the surveillance effort. - Mod.TY
