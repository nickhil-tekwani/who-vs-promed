The Collector mentioned in the post is the District Collector in each
district of India. This is the topmost civil administrator in each
district. They
have a lot of administrative powers and this is a post we inherited from
the
British, from the Indian Civil Service (ICS) as it was called during
colonial
days. Now the new name is INDIAN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES (IAS). This
is a group of efficient officials in India and they are not political
appointees.

The Collector is the administrative head of the district. This
nomenclature has been a legacy from the British days when the
Collector was the overall administrative official in charge of an area
called the
Collectorate. His primary role in those days was to collect the taxes
and hence probably the name. Today, most States have the District
Magistrate as the head of the district and have done away with the name
'Collector' and all the Government departments (at the district level )
including the Health 'incharge' report to him. In times of crisis, he is
the one who coordinates all the rescue and relief operations.
I hope now that Mod.CHC is reassured that we don't send out body /
stamp collectors in times of crisis!
