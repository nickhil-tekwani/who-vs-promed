Rheumatologists have reported the 1st confirmed case of Ross River virus to have reached Japan.

A 31 year old Japanese female who resided in Australia from January to May last year [2013] presented to hospital in March [2013] with sudden onset left ankle and right knee joint pain with no fever or rash. She received no formal diagnosis, but persistent joint pain resulted in the patient presenting to the authors' clinic when she returned to Japan [the authors of the original published report, in Japanese, are Tochitani K, Shimizu T, Shinohara K, Tsuchido Y, Moi ML, Takasaki T].

Blood tests revealed no signs of arthritis, but a check for Ross River virus (RRV) antibody levels revealed positive results for RRV IgG antibody and IgM antibody, and the patient was diagnosed with acute RRV disease.

"With the increase in the number of travelers and length of stay in RRV endemic regions, health care providers need to consider the disease in their differential diagnosis, among returning travelers with arthralgia, fever, rash and a travel history to RRV-endemic regions," the authors advised.

[This is another example of individuals acquiring an infection away from their home country but with their illness diagnosed upon return home. This case underscores the need to take a good travel history, with inclusion of corresponding etiological agents in the list of rule outs. It also illustrates the need for comprehensive laboratory support to establish the diagnosis. The report does not indicate where the patient had been in Australia. RRV transmission has been active in several states in Australia this year and last (2014 and 2013). In the above case, there was no risk of ongoing transmission of RRV in Japan. - Mod.TY
