The people of Deraniyagala have been warned about the spread of chikungunya
in the area.

About 150 are suspected to have contracted this disease, said Dr AN Palinda
Karunatilleke, DMO [district medical officer], Eratne Rural Hospital. Dr
Karunatilleke has informed the public health inspector to create an
awareness among the public about this disease.

The spread of this fever is attributed to the insanitary conditions in
certain estate line rooms.

ProMED rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The "insanitary conditions" mentioned in this report probably refers to
trash and other items that contain water and serve as breeding sites for
_Aedes aegypti_, a chikungunya virus vector. ProMED-mail would appreciate
further information about this apparent chiukungunya outbreak to confirm
(or not) the etiology of the agent involved.
