The provincial government has transferred an official of the
livestock department from Swabi to Mardan as punishment for allegedly
disclosing that H5N1 strain of bird flu influenza had been detected
in a poultry farm of the district, sources told Dawn.

They claimed that on the advice of a local MPA [Member Provincial
Assembly], who favoured the poultry farm owners, the Basic Livestock
Officer was made a scapegoat for revealing the information and
"transferred within a day as the process usually takes a month."

Earlier, the livestock department had conducted a test of poultry
samples at the National Research Institute Islamabad that reportedly
detected H5N1 virus in the poultry samples taken from a poultry farm
in Tordher, Swabi.

In contrast to this report, the Poultry Association Swabi claimed
that they had conducted a similar test of the poultry sample at the
Poultry Research Institute Rawalpindi, which identified the virus as
H5N9, which was not dangerous for human beings.

Meanwhile, a team of the World Health Organisation (WHO) discussed
the bird flu issue with the local authorities in Swabi. They
discussed the signs and symptoms of the avian influenza with the
healthcare providers at the 2 basic health units and one rural health
centre in the area. The local health workers were instructed to
conduct daily fever monitoring of all poultry workers along with
their families.

As there is no isolation ward at the District Headquarters Hospital
Swabi, the WHO has recommended that suspected cases of avian
influenza in the area be shifted to the Khyber Teaching Hospital in
Peshawar.

The WHO has recommended an early disease warning system in the
district to prevent outbreaks of the disease and that specific
veterinary staff for bird flu investigation and surveillance in the
district be sensitized, it added. Currently there is no proper
surveillance system.

Sources said that upon the recommendation of the WHO, about 1700
birds at the poultry farm were culled, whereas 4300 had already died.
The birds had been supplied to the farm by a Lahore-based company.
