First report of fusarium wilt of cucumber caused by _Fusarium
oxysporum_ in Spain

In 2000, cucumber (_Cucumis sativus_ L. cv. Albatros) in several
commercial greenhouses in south-eastern Spain (Almería) exhibited
symptoms of wilt, yellowing, and necrotic streaks on the stems.
Internal, vascular discoloration in affected plants extended from
the base of the stem upward. Initial observations were reminiscent
of Fusarium wilt disease of cucumber, caused by _Fusarium oxysporum_
Schlechtend:Fr. f. sp. _cucumerinum_ (Foc) J.H. Owen, as described
by Owen (1955).
Pure colonies of fungi were isolated from surface-disinfested (with
flame) stem segments, cut at 0.5 m above the hypocotyl, on PDA
medium. Isolates were identified as Foc due to their production of
typical macroconidia with foot-shaped basal cells, microconidia
borne in false heads only on monophialides, and chlamydospores.
To confirm pathogenicity, 8 isolates (1-week-old cultures grown on
PDA) were used to root-dip inoculate (1 million conidia per ml)
1-week-old seedlings of cucumber cvs. Nevada and Albatros. Seedlings
were then transplanted into pots containing vermiculite growth
medium and placed in a greenhouse.
Of the tested isolates, 87.5 percent were pathogenic, causing wilt
symptoms or death in 60 to 100 percent of dip-inoculated plants, from
which Foc was consistently reisolated. Symptoms observed in
inoculated
plants were similar to those observed in cucumber plants in
commercial greenhouses.
This is the first report of Foc causing Fusarium wilt of cucumber in Spain.

[This is the first report of Foc on cucumber in ProMED-Plant. Foc is
soilborne and can infect cucumber at any growth stage. Freshly seeded
cucumbers may damp-off below ground or as newly emerged seedlings.
If older plants are attacked prior to 'running', the entire plant
will exhibit a mid-day wilt. After several days of wilting, leaves
will tip burn followed closely by a complete wilt and plant death.
Disease management involves crop rotation (usually 5 years) in crop
land previously infested with the pathogen. In greenhouses, strict
phytosanitary measures should be employed, including soil fumigation.
Chemical treatments for disease management are available.
