Secondary and tertiary transfer of Vaccinia virus among US military
personnel; US and worldwide, 2002-2004
-------------------------------------------------
In December 2002, the Department of Defense (DoD) began vaccinating
military personnel as part of the pre-event vaccination program (1).
Because vaccinia virus is present on the skin at the site of vaccination,
it can spread to other parts of the body (autoinoculation) or to contacts
of vaccinees (contact transfer).
To prevent autoinoculation and contact transfer, DoD gave vaccinees printed
information that focused on handwashing, covering the vaccination site, and
limiting contact with infants (1,2). This report describes cases of contact
transfer of vaccinia virus among vaccinated military personnel since
December 2002; findings indicate that contact transfer of vaccinia virus is
rare. Continued efforts are needed to educate vaccinees about the
importance of proper vaccination-site care in preventing contact
transmission, especially in household settings.
DoD conducts surveillance for vaccine-associated adverse events by using
automated immunization registries, military communication channels, and the
Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS). Contact transfer cases are
defined as those in which vaccinia virus is confirmed by viral culture or
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Other cases are classified as
suspected on the basis of lesion description and reported linkage to a
vaccinated person 3 to 9 days before lesion development.
During the period Dec 2002 to Jan 2004, a total of 578 286 military
personnel were vaccinated; 508 546 (88 per cent) were male, and 407 923 (71
per cent) were primary vaccinees (received smallpox vaccination for the 1st
time). The median age of vaccinees was 29 years (range: 17 to 76). Among
vaccinees, cases of suspected contact transfer of vaccinia were identified
among 30 persons: 12 spouses, 8 adult intimate contacts, 8 adult friends,
and 2 children in the same household. These cases were reported from
Colorado (4), North Carolina (4), Texas (4), Alaska (2), California (2),
one in each of Connecticut, Kansas, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina,
Washington state, West Virginia, and overseas (7). The sources of suspected
contact transfer were all male service members who were primary vaccinees.
Except for 6 male sports partners, all infected contacts were female.
Vaccinia virus was confirmed in 18 (60 per cent) of the 30 cases by viral
culture or PCR. Sixteen of the 18 confirmed cases involved uncomplicated
infections of the skin; 2 involved the eye (3). None resulted in eczema
vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia. 12 of the 18 confirmed cases were among
spouses or adult intimate contacts. The observed rate of contact transfer
was 5.2 per 100 000 vaccinees overall or 7.4 per 100 000 primary vaccinees.
Among 27 700 smallpox-vaccinated DoD health-care workers, no transmission
of vaccinia from a vaccinated health-care worker to an unvaccinated patient
or from a vaccinated patient to an unvaccinated health-care worker has been
identified.
2 of the 18 confirmed cases of transfer of vaccinia virus resulted from
tertiary transfer. One involved a service member, his wife, and their
breast-fed infant; the other involved serial transmission among male sports
partners.
Case reports
------------
Case 1
------
In early May 2003, a service member received his primary smallpox
vaccination. About 6 to 8 days after vaccination, he experienced a major
reaction (an event that indicates a successful take; is characterized by a
papule, vesicle, ulcer, or crusted lesion, surrounded by an area of
induration; and usually results in a scar) (4). The vaccinee reported no
substantial pruritus. He slept in the same bed as his wife and kept the
vaccination site covered with bandages. After bathing, he reportedly dried
the vaccination site with tissue, which he discarded into a trash
receptacle. He also used separate towels to dry himself, rolled them so the
area that dried his arm was inside, and placed them in a laundry container.
His wife handled bed linen, soiled clothing, and towels; she reported that
she did not see any obvious drainage on clothing or linen and had no direct
contact with the vaccination site.
In mid-May, the wife had vesicular skin lesions on each breast near the
areola but continued to breastfeed. About 2 weeks later, she was examined
at a local hospital, treated for mastitis, and continued to breastfeed. The
same day, the infant had a vesicular lesion on the upper lip, followed by
another lesion on the left cheek (5). 3 days later, the infant was examined
by a pediatrician, when another lesion was noted on her tongue. Because of
possible early atopic dermatitis lesions on the infant's cheeks, contact
vaccinia infection with increased risk for eczema vaccinatum was
considered. The infant was transferred to a military referral medical
center for further evaluation. On examination, the infant had seborrheic
dermatitis and no ocular involvement. Skin lesion specimens from the mother
and infant tested positive for vaccinia by viral culture and PCR at the
Alaska Health Department Laboratory and at Madigan Army Medical Center.
Because both patients were stable clinically and the lesions were healing
without risk for more serious complications, vaccinia immune globulin was
not administered. Neither patient had systemic complications from the
infection.
Case 2
------
In July 2003, a service member who had been vaccinated was wrestling with
an unvaccinated service member at a military recreational function when the
bandages covering the vaccination site fell off. The unvaccinated service
member subsequently wrestled with another unvaccinated service member. 6
days later, both unvaccinated service members had lesions on their
forearms, neck, and face. Skin lesion specimens from both men tested
positive for vaccinia virus by PCR and viral culture at Tripler Army
Medical Center's microbiology laboratory.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
The findings in this report indicate that the primary risk for secondary
transfer of vaccinia was among persons who shared a bed; 12 of the 18
confirmed cases were spouses or adult intimate contacts. However, the
majority of vaccinated DoD personnel who shared a bed did not transfer
vaccinia virus to their contacts. The frequency of contact transfer in the
military vaccination program is comparable to rates observed during the
1960s, although persons are less likely to be immune to vaccinia today and
thus are more susceptible to contact transfer (1).
The 1st case of tertiary transfer described in this report underscores the
need for breastfeeding mothers with household contact with vaccinees to
take precautions to prevent inadvertent transmission of vaccinia to their
infants. Direct contact is presumed to be the major mode of transmission,
but clothing and bed linen might act as vectors for secondary transmission.
Tertiary transmission, although rare, is facilitated when the secondary
infection is not recognized. Programs that educate health care workers,
vaccinees, and contacts should note that new vesicles or pustules that
appear <15 days after the vaccinia scab falls off from the vaccination site
might be vaccinia infections. Although an infant living in the home is not
a contraindication to vaccination of a family member in a non-outbreak
setting, measures to prevent transmission include having vaccinees launder
their own linens and towels and change their bandages away from other
household members.
During the 1960s, the rate of unintentional infection with vaccinia in
secondary contacts was 2-6 cases per 100 000 primary vaccinees (4,6,7).
During that period, 2/3 of reported contact infections occurred among
children, typically siblings. Such spread could manifest as an inadvertent
infection or, in more severe fashion, as eczema vaccinatum or progressive
vaccinia. Infections of the skin predominated, with rarer ocular
involvement posing a risk for scarring or keratitis. In the current DoD
smallpox vaccination program, no cases of eczema vaccinatum have occurred,
although the population of atopic dermatitis patients might have increased
substantially since the 1960s (8). During the 1960s, eczema vaccinatum
resulted in deaths, and 2/3 of such cases were related to contact transfer
of vaccinia virus (6). In the current DoD smallpox vaccination program,
careful screening of DoD vaccinees and their household contacts for skin
diseases along with targeted education likely contributed to both screening
out vaccine candidates with personal or close-contact contraindications and
educating vaccinees about proper infection-control measures.
Health care workers and the public should report suspected cases of contact
transfer of vaccinia virus to their state or local health departments and
to VAERS at <http://www.vaers.org>, or by telephone 800-822-7967. Viral
culture or PCR assays, important for confirming vaccinia virus, are
available from the majority of state public health laboratories.
