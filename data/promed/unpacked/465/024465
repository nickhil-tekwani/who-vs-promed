Lyme disease tracking indicates increased case numbers
The number of reported cases of Lyme disease increased by 70 percent over a
six-year period ending in 1998, the federal government said. The U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were 16 802 reported
cases of Lyme disease in
1998, compared to 9909 cases in 1992. The report attributed the rise to
more incidents and improved reporting of the disease.
Over the six-year period, 92 percent of reported cases were in Connecticut,
Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and
Rhode Island and
two north-central states -- Minnesota and Wisconsin, the CDC said. The
majority of reported cases had onsets of disease in June, July, or August,
corresponding with the seasonal feeding activity of the tick, the CDC said.
