African swine fever [ASF], Hungary
----------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 18 May 2018 from Dr Lajos Bognar, Deputy State Secretary Chief Veterinary Officer, Food Chain Safety Department, Ministry of Agriculture, Budapest, Hungary

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 May 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 16 May 2018
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Causal agent: African swine fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Tiszakerecseny settlement, Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 May 2018
Outbreak status: resolved on 15 May 2018
Epidemiological unit: forest
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Wild boar: _Sus scrofa_ (Suidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Wild boar: _Sus scrofa_ (Suidae) / ** / ** / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with wild species
Epidemiological comments: a dead wild boar was found in Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg county, only around 1 km [0.6 mi] away from the Ukrainian border on [14 May 2018]. A sample was taken and sent to the National Reference Laboratory and ASF was confirmed by PCR on [16 May 2018]. Taking into consideration the distance to the infected neighboring regions in Ukraine and the spring migration of wild boars, natural spread is the most likely source of infection.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; control of wildlife reservoirs; zoning; disinfection; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Food Chain Safety Office Animal Health Diagnostic Directorate (National laboratory) / wild boar / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 16 May 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["The ASF epidemic has been spreading throughout the Caucasus and Eastern Europe since its entry from Africa into Georgia in 2007. The disease spread quickly throughout the Caucasus and into the Russian Federation (2007). Over the past years, the disease has progressively spread westwards, entering Ukraine (2012), Belarus (2013), the European Union (Lithuania, Poland, Latvia, and Estonia, 2014), Moldova (2016), the Czech Republic and Romania (2017), materializing the threat of ASF to the rest of Europe in what is probably the biggest animal health issue in the continent due to its trade disruption and significant damage on small-scale pig farmers. Particularly in the EU, wild boar has been proved to play the main role in ASF infection, spread and maintenance. Although not completely understood, transmission seems to depend largely on the population density of wild boar and their interaction with low-biosecurity pig production" (http://www.fao.org/europe/events/detail-events/en/c/1051367/).

Learning how to limit or stop this vector of infection was the central topic of an FAO workshop in Kaunas, Lithuania, in November 2017. More information on this workshop and the technical presentation given in that meeting are available at http://www.fao.org/europe/events/detail-events/en/c/1051367/.- Mod.CRD
