The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [24 Nov 2017] that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) national reference laboratory has confirmed a case of equine infectious anemia (EIA) in a horse in Havelock, Quebec.

"This animal had been sampled by an accredited veterinarian prior to it being moved to a new premises; clinical signs of the disease were not reported," the EDCC stated. "A CFIA investigation is underway and, as per program policy, a quarantine has been placed on the infected animal and its on-premise contacts. The quarantine will remain until all disease response activities have been completed on the premises, including follow-up testing and ordering the destruction of positive cases."

In January [2017], animal health officials confirmed another EIA case in a horse in Quebec's Lanaudi√®re region. It was the province's 1st confirmed EIA case since 2011.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to a non-infected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies, and more rarely through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of EIA, and most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test in order to travel.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Obvious clinical signs of the disease include progressive loss of condition along with muscle weakness and poor stamina. An affected horse also could show fever, depression, and anemia.

[It is very late in the year for a case of EIA. One might suspect the cold weather would have reduced the insects capable of transmitting this disease. However, these insects are capable of finding warm niches to wait in until their next blood meal comes close.

EIA is transmitted by flies and other blood-meal insects (mosquitoes, tabanid flies, etc.). There is no safe effective treatment or vaccination. - Mod.TG
