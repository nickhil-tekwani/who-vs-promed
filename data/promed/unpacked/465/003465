The Odisha government has asked the local administration of 3 districts, 2 in the coastal region and one in the southern zone, to remain on high alert after a confirmed case of bird flu [avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus infection] was detected in Chilka lake which houses one of the top most winter homes for migratory birds in the country.

The nearly 1100 sq km [425 sq mi] in size brackish water lagoon, spreads over the 3 districts of Khurda, Puri, and Ganjam. "Last month [January 2013] we had sent blood samples of 8 migratory birds for tests in a laboratory outside the state and one of them has been confirmed as a positive case of bird flu. Therefore, the 3 districts which are having direct links with Chilka lake have been put on high alert," said an official in the wildlife division of the state forest department.

Official sources said, a team of experts had been sent to the famous water body on Sunday [24 Feb 2013] and they had collected blood samples of some more migratory birds besides a few birds from the poultry farms in the villages in and around the lake. They would be sent for laboratory test soon. The news of the bird flu outbreak has triggered panic in the entire coastal belt primarily because the state had been hit hard by the dreaded avian flu last year [2012]. The areas which were affected included the capital, Bhubaneswar.

However, the state fisheries and animal husbandry department has advised the people not to panic. The department has already formed a rapid action team to handle the situation. Moreover, as the temperature is getting warmer by every passing day in the state, the possibility of the spread of the disease is lower. The migratory birds in the Chilka lake have already begun their homeward journey, which may also help the authorities to handle the situation better. This winter [2012-13], nearly 890 000 winged visitors had made the Odisha lake their temporary abode. There are about 500 000 birds still present in the lake.

The Wildlife Wing of the State Government on Saturday [23 Feb 2013] said there is no reason to panic after avian influenza was reported from a migratory bird that had visited the Chilika [Chilka] lagoon.

Chief Wildlife Warden JD Sharma said, a watch has been kept in Nalabana Bird Sanctuary but so far no bird casualty has been noticed or reported. "Most birds have turned homewards after their winter sojourn but we will send another set of samples soon to ascertain if the flu is identified in others," he told this paper.

The Chilika Wildlife Division also chipped in with an advisory appealing to people not to eat dead birds and return the carcass either to local police or forest offices. The division employed its personnel to carry out intensive search in the bird sanctuary for 2 consecutive days but found no dead birds.

However, the Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services sent a letter to the Khurda Chief veterinary Officer asking the latter to take precautionary measures in view of the report.

The avian influenza matter though remained confusing since no full-fledged report was received by the Chilika Wildlife Division from the High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory (HSADL), Bhopal, where the samples were sent last month [January 2013]. All the division received was a letter from Khurda collectorate that said bird flu has been reported in a pintail duck.

On 21 Jan 2013, samples had been collected from 2 ruddy shelducks, Eurasian wigeons, gadwals as well one northern pintail and a shoveller. The pintail had been ringed with a number F 70699 and so far the ring has not been returned either. 3 different samples -- oropharyngeal, cloacal, and blood serum -- were collected from the 8 birds. It was not known which samples [revealed] the avian influenza.

Meanwhile, the Chilika Wildlife Division will collect more samples in the next couple of days and send them for fresh tests.

During early 2012, India reported to the OIE 3 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in the same state, Orissa, of which 2 were in rural backyard poultry, one in a government poultry farm, and one in a wild bird (crow). The OIE notifications and a map can be seen at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000011769_20120316_171359.pdf.

In case the current suspected cases are confirmed, official notification is anticipated. - Mod.AS
