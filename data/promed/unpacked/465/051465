UPDATE ON THE EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE IN DRC; No. 10
[12 Sep 2014] -12 pm
-----------------------------------------
[A table is available at the above URL entitled "Data update from 19 August to 8 September 2014". It notes 66 cases, an increase of 4. Among these, 24 are laboratory confirmed, 26 probable and 14 suspect. It notes 37 deaths, an increase of 2. See the above URL for complete details.]

Coordination/ Keys developments

*The number of suspected cases has fallen, as some have been laboratory confirmed.

**12 alerts including one with death in Kokolo military camp in Kinshasa, a 2nd reported in Kambove in Katanga and 10 cases of which 8 deaths reported in Bongandanga, Equateur Provincer. Five samples from Bongandanga and from Nyakunde in Ituri (Orientale Province) are being analyzed.

Between [2 and 10 Sep 2014], 35 cases of EVD have been reported in the area of Djera in Equateur Province in DRC, increasing the cumulative number of cases to 66 (see the above table for details).

Two additional treatment centers are operational since [9 Sep 2014] with the capacity of 50 beds

Some local/provincial committees of the CNC (Ebola response coordination) are not operating optimally like Kinshasa; some coordination tools for the smooth functioning of these structures at local / provincial level are still unavailable

Epidemic Control Commission (ECC) has submitted a health roadmap on the management and prevention of the Ebola Virus Disease to the DRC Minister of Health as per recommendations of the latest meeting of SADEC [Southern African Development Community] Ministers of Public Health held in Zimbabwe.

Two hotline numbers have been set up to allow the population to get information on the disease and ongoing efforts: 081 08 000 20 and 099 99 710 05. An additional hotline for information on the prevention of the EVD is available using Tigo: 119.

The contingency plan for Kinshasa has been finalized, but actions for its full activation are yet to be taken.

Security and Logistics
----------------------
The bad state of the road between Boende and Lokolia is one of the main logistic constraints, disrupting routing of heavy equipment and other medical inputs necessary for the fight against EVD. The government has instructed the Office de Route for a rapid rehabilitation of this road section.

INRB [Institut National de recherches biologiques] needs a regular fuel supply to deal with untimely power outages by the SNEL [Societe Nationale d'Electricite de la Republique Democratique du Congo] during laboratory tests

Gaps

[The number of cases and even the dates covered by this report are not completely clear (the heading indicates that counts are through 8 Sep 2014, but the footnotes appear to indicate that counts are through 10 Sep 2014). Nonetheless, there appears to be an ongoing slight increase in cases and deaths. We await the next WHO for further data.

The logistical and financial obstacles to managing the Ebola virus disease outbreak in this remote region are daunting and the International agencies and NGO's working in the region deserve our praise and support.

The PDF linked to from this site also includes a map of the region and tables (in French) delineating responsibilities among various agencies. - Mod.LM
