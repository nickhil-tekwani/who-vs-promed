A herd of dairy cattle from a farm near Cheddar has been quarantined after
a suspected outbreak of BSE, more commonly known as mad cow disease.
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) imposed
movement restrictions on the herd at 2 sites, Draycott and Rodney Stoke,
after 2 cows which had been slaughtered showed possible signs of BSE.
Further tests are now being carried out on the carcasses to establish
whether or not the animals had the disease.
The outbreak was discovered after the cattle's owner, Bryan Churches, was
banned from keeping cattle for 3 years after being convicted of causing
pain and suffering to animals on his farm.
He was given 3 months to dispose of the cattle and it was while he was
doing this that signs of BSE were discovered.
Mr Churches, who farms at Bridge Farm, in Draycott, and Yew Tree Farm, in
Rodney Stoke, had 36 cattle which didn't have cattle passports. These are
needed so the source and history of the cattle can be traced and because of
this, the 36 animals were slaughtered.
A spokesman for Defra said: "We can confirm that in order to comply with a
court order which prevents him from keeping livestock, that needs to be
complied with by 23 Jan 2006, Mr Churches removed 36 unpassported cattle
from his farms. These were slaughtered and tested for BSE. 2 animals showed
possible signs of BSE. Further checks are required to check that these
animals did in fact have the disease. Movement restrictions have now been
applied to the remainder of the herd."
The cattle suspected of having BSE were born after a ban on the animal
feed, thought to be the cause of the disease, was introduced in 1996.
Despite the ban, at the moment, there are around 200 suspected cases of BSE
in the UK.
But, according to Defra, one possible explanation of cases which have
occurred since the ban was introduced is that the infection may have
lingered in feed stores.

[The causative agent of BSE -- a prion -- is extremely resistant to widely
varying environmental, physical, and chemical conditions. Contaminated
animal feed, such as concentrates including residues of meat and bone meal
(MBM) or feed cross-contaminated by contact with such, maintains its
infectivity for many years. If the suspected cases are confirmed, remnants
of such feeds on the farm could be the background to the current
born-after-ban (BAB) cases.
The number of recorded BSE cases in the UK is steadily decreasing: since
2000 throughout 2005 (Data as of 30 Sep 2005), OIE respective annual UK
figures (totals) are the following: 1443, 1202, 1144, 611, 343, 151. -
