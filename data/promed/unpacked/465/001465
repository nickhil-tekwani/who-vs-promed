Classical Swine fever in Belize
------------------
Invalidation of diagnosis
See also: 13 Dec 2002
Information received on 12 Dec 2002 from Dr Victor Gongora, Director of
Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Belmopan:
Report date: 12 Dec 2002.
On 6 Dec 2002, Belize reported a suspected outbreak of classical swine
fever (CSF) to the OIE (see Disease Information, 15 [50], 260, dated 13 Dec
2002). The diagnosis was based on direct immunofluorescence (polyclonal
conjugate) test results received from the Central and Reference Laboratory
(Laboratorio Central y Referencia) in Managua, Nicaragua. Even though these
results required confirmation, an emergency report was submitted to the OIE
pending confirmation so as to be transparent.
The USDA-APHIS(1) Foreign Animal Disease Laboratory in Greenport, New York,
United States of America, issued negative results, as follows: direct
fluorescent antibody test, immunoperoxidase test and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) were performed all with negative results for CSF and African
swine fever. The tests were carried out on serum, tonsils, spleens, kidneys
and lymph nodes.
In addition to the above negative results:
- no macroscopic signs of CSF were seen at post-mortem examination. Swill
feeding has been practised on the farm; farm management is reported to be
poor; the pigs are of poor genetic quality and are possibly suffering from
vitamin E / selenium deficiency;
- in the focal and perifocal areas no evidence of disease was found; pigs
tested (30 per farm) were negative for CSF by ELISA(2).
Virus isolation results are still pending but were negative at 48 hours.
Given the negative results for CSF, all emergency measures are being lifted
and the country goes back on regular surveillance for CSF. Belize is free
from CSF.
Note by the OIE Central Bureau: In accordance with the provisions of the
International Animal Health Code, Belize most appropriately submitted an
emergency report on the suspicion of CSF, even before all the laboratory
results had been received. This is a good example of transparency and
should be followed by all OIE Member Countries to comply with the
obligations to which they have subscribed and to improve the OIE early
warning system.
