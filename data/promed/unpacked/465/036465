Five Malaysian states have registered a leap in the number of dengue
fever cases in the 1st week of the year, with authorities fearing
that the mosquito-borne disease could further spread due to the rainy
season, reports said Wednesday. The northeastern state of Kelantan
registered the highest jump, from 18 cases in the last week of
December [2006] to 32 cases in the first week of January [2007].
The central Selangor state, neighbouring the capital Kuala Lumpur,
recorded the highest number of cases at 562, compared to 471 the
previous week, the Health Ministry's deputy director-general Ramlee
Rahmat was quoted as saying by the official Bernama news agency. The
other 3 states that recorded an increase were the central state of
Pahang, from 35 to 47, the state of Negeri Sembilan, from 20 to 26,
and the eastern Sabah state on Borneo island, from 9 to 12.
Ramlee said the 1st week of the year recorded a total of 1155
suspected dengue cases, an increase of 5 cases from the week before.
A total of 60 health officials have been deployed in the affected
states to help with dengue control operations, which include checks
on premises as well as educational talks, he said.
Health officials have warned that the rise in dengue could continue,
in spite of efforts by the government to control it, due to the rainy
monsoon season. They have issued warnings to residents to clean their
property to be rid of the larvae of the _Aedes_ mosquito, which
carries the dengue virus.
Symptoms of dengue are high fever and rashes. If not detected and
treated early, the disease can be fatal. Ramlee said that officials
have been sent to the southern Johor state, which was hit by massive
floods in December 2006, to prevent an outbreak of the disease.
Authorities have warned that the aftermath of the floods, which has
been tagged as the worst in a century, could lead to a rise in dengue
cases as well as an increase in cases of other diseases.

[2] Malaysia - virus serotypes

Two deadlier forms of dengue virus have resurfaced in Malaysia, which
could mean a higher death toll in 2007, says a dengue expert. The
resurgence is why doctors are seeing patients with the more severe
form of dengue fever, said University Malaya Medical Centre's Prof Dr
Sazaly Abu Bakar. "This year, we have been seeing predominantly the
Den-2 and Den-3 viruses (in samples sent for testing)," said the head
of the UMMC's medical microbiology department.
Suspected dengue cases have risen by 1/3 to 1155 in the 1st week this
year [2007], from 865 in mid-November [2006], and health authorities
are bracing themselves for more.
Den-2 and Den-3 are 2 of the 4 viruses that cause dengue and dengue
haemorrhagic fever. And these 2 viruses have a particularly bad
effect on those who have survived dengue fever caused by Den-1,
another form of the virus. Immunity from one virus does not confer
immunity from the other 3.
While Den-1 is endemic to Malaysia, the incidence of Den-2 and Den-3
occurs in cycles. Den-2 last struck in 1998/99 and Den-3 in 2003.
Den-3 is expected to gain dominance over Den-2 in 2008/9, said Dr
Sazaly. Den-4 has lost the predominance it had in the '60s and '70s.
Malaysia had not yet been struck by Den-4 [this year], he added.
Detection had improved with 2 new techniques that identify dengue
antigens within a day, he said.
Known as Dengue NS1 and PCR molecular detection, each test costs
between RM30 and RM60, and is available in some private hospitals.
The conventional test works only 4-6 days after the 1st symptoms
appear. "It is better if people can get their results on the 1st day
of symptoms so that appropriate measures can be taken to stop or
reduce the spread of the disease," he added.

The Bogor regency-run Cibinong Hospital has been forced to move most
of its dengue fever patients to its function hall. The hospital's
director of services, Wahyu Kurdijanti, said it had run out of room
to accommodate the dengue patients, who number 58 in total, including
18 children.
"Previously, we had them lying up and down the corridors, but it
wasn't comfortable for them or their doctors," she said.
Anticipating further outbreaks of dengue in the regency, the Army's
transportation and logistics battalion in Cibinong, Bogor, has loaned
15 cots to the hospital. Wahyu said only 10 hospital beds were
currently unused. "We usually handle 1-2 dengue cases a day, but
patient numbers soar in the wet season," Wahyu added.
Most of the patients are from Karadenan village in Cibinong and
Cileungsi, Gunung Putri and Citeureup districts. Besides those
districts, the regency health agency has recorded Ciomas, Bojong Gede
and Darmaga districts as endemic areas.
Eulis Wulantari, the head of the health agency's communicable
diseases unit, said of the 685 dengue cases reported in 2006, 15
patients died. In 2005, the agency recorded 608 cases and 23 deaths.
"We have yet to update the data from last week. Our latest data says
there are 7 cases and one death," she said.

Multiple cases of dengue fever have been reported in Yogyakarta,
where one person has died so far.
The Bantul Health and Communicable Diseases Handling Office said it
did not have concrete data on infection numbers. "Based on our data
only 2 people were infected, including the person who passed away,"
the office's head, Maya Sintawa, said Tuesday.
The office's data contradicts the number of hospital patients with
symptoms of the disease, however, with 4 patients treated at
Panembahan Senopati Hospital alone.
Maya said areas affected by the 27 May 2006 earthquake were prone to
the outbreak of disease. "Debris from damaged houses and other
buildings are favorable breeding grounds for mosquitoes," she said.
Many earthquake survivors have been forced to live in makeshift
shelters and tents, leaving them exposed to disease-carrying insects
such as mosquitoes.
Data at the Bantul Health Office showed that following the May
earthquake the number of people suffering from dengue fever jumped by
290, up to 498. Six of these died as a result of the disease. Four
deaths were recorded from 208 reported infections in 2005.
In efforts to prevent the disease from spreading, the Bantul Health
Office has launched an initiative on Dec. 29 [2006], to eradicate
mosquitoes. "Such a movement is considered the most effective means
of fighting further outbreaks," Maya said. Maya further urged
residents to immediately send children with symptoms of dengue fever
to the hospital. "Don't wait, or sufferers may not survive," she said.
The Yogyakarta mayoralty has donated one ton of anti-larva abate
powder to local residents to help prevent future dengue outbreaks.
The powder is being distributed from community health centers
throughout the city's 17 districts.

Classical dengue fever and DHF continue to challenge the health
authorities of the Ministry of Health in Diriamba y Jinotepe
department [equivalent to state - Mod.TY]
The person in charge of epidemiology of the Local System for
Integrated Care [Spanish acronym SILAIS], Ms. Yolanda Gonzalez, told
El Nuevo Diario that up to [epidemiological] week 51, the last week
in 2006, 1351 suspected cases of classical [dengue fever] were
recorded, of which 180 were laboratory confirmed.
In regards to DHF, during 2006 it took the life of a young university
student in the city of Diriamba. The [SILAIS] official said that
during that period 98 suspected [DHF] cases were recorded and that 11
were laboratory confirmed with the single fatality, the university
student who died in the past November [2006].
This outbreak, which still affects the department, is due to the
[lack of] cooperation received from the population, according to the
Ministry of Health [Spanish acronym MINSA]. They do not eliminate
adult mosquitoes nor breeding sites. Many families are not
accustomed to changing water stored in containers [in their houses].
Entomological surveys confirm that _Aedes aegypti_, the mosquito that
transmits dengue [virus], is distributed widely throughout the
Jinotepe y Diriamba neighborhoods. That is why the dengue and
malaria eradication and control control brigades have fumigated
house-by-house with pickup truck-[mounted] foggers. In addition, the
people have begun to cooperate, although at times reluctantly.
According to the latest statistics, dengue incidence has declined,
possibly thanks to the efforts of MINSA, but which, according to
Gonzalez, is not sufficient to reduce the reported cases to zero and
avoid more transmission, and in the worst cases deaths, from dengue.

[WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one per cent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
