Over the next 2 weeks, 50 000 horses will be vaccinated against the
highly contagious equine influenza virus.
Infected areas in New South Wales and Queensland will be the 1st to
be targeted, while competitors in Victoria's Spring Carnival will
also be vaccinated.
The release of the vaccine is being welcomed, but some in the
industry say it should have been done much earlier. Federal
Agriculture Minister Peter McGauran says vaccinations will begin by
the end of this week. "There will be 20 000 vaccines arriving late
on Thursday [27 Sep 2007] night, and will begin to be distributed on
Friday morning," he said. The following Thursday, a further 30 000
vaccines become available. Because of us placing an order today for
an extra 100 000, which should begin to arrive in about 2 weeks, it
means that we can vaccinate 50 000 horses over the next 2 weeks."
Greg Tannock, a professor in virology at RMIT, says the horse
industry needs to accept that vaccination against the equine
influenza virus is now a part of life. "Just the way it's spread
throughout this country, it's in large numbers of horses in New South
Wales and Queensland," he said. "Hopefully we'll keep it out of the
Spring Carnival here in Melbourne so that the Melbourne Cup and all
the associated events can take place. But it'd be, I think in the
longer term, a forlorn hope that it's not going to spread eventually
to the rest of the country, and for that, ongoing vaccination will be needed."
The Government will split 18 500 vials of the vaccine between NSW and
Queensland. Victoria, which is still disease free, will get 1500 vials.
Barry Smyth is the President of the Australian Horse Industry
Council. He is also part of the Equine Influenza National Management
Group that decided where the vaccine will go. "The major concern at
the moment is to prevent spread of the disease outside the red zones
in New South Wales and Queensland, and so it's important to immunize
horses in the buffer zones to prevent spread of the disease," he
said. "To protect the horses that will race in Victoria over the
Spring Carnival that's in the next 4 to 6 weeks, they will be
vaccinated in an attempt to protect them against equine influenza
should it find its way into Victoria."
The Victorian racing industry had been calling for enough vaccine to
protect every thoroughbred in the state. One of Australia's leading
trainers, David Hayes, fears the allocated amount will not be
enough. "It sounds like there's going to be under 2000 allocated to
Victoria," he said. "Hopefully that's enough to cover the critical
mass that'll be racing over the carnival over the next 6 weeks. I
would have preferred more, obviously."
But even with the vaccine, it is unlikely horses from NSW will be
allowed across the border to compete in Victoria's Spring Racing
Carnival. Mr Hayes says it is an unfortunate but necessary step. "I
would personally like them to come because it makes the carnival more
intriguing, and they're an important part of the Australian scene,
but I personally think in the current climate, it's going to be
impossible for them to come down," he said. "If it's a Randwick
horse, it would be impossible because they've missed too much work.
Warwick Farm horses now are getting it just now, so they'll be wiped
out completely. They're all in lockdown, so I think it'd nearly be impossible."

[Although there is the complaint that vaccine should have been
distributed and started earlier, the regulatory officials began the
process in a timely fashion. As the disease had never previously been
in Australia, there was no vaccine in the country. The government is
trying to get enough vaccine. Surely they will be able to get ahead
of the virus shortly. The vaccine is required to be given twice,
about 2-3 weeks between injections, to fully protect a horse. - Mod.TG]
