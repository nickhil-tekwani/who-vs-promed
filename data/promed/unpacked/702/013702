In the United States, yellow fever (YF) vaccination is recommended for
travelers and active duty military members visiting endemic areas of
sub-Saharan Africa and Central/South America (1,2). The American Red Cross
recommends that recipients of YF vaccine defer blood product donation for 2
weeks because of the theoretical risk for transmission from a viremic donor
(3). On 10 Apr 2009, a hospital blood bank supervisor learned that, on 27
Mar 2009, blood products had been collected from 89 US active duty trainees
who had received YF vaccine 4 days before donation. This report summarizes
the subsequent investigation by the hospital and CDC to identify lapses in
donor deferral and to determine whether transfusion-related transmission of
YF vaccine virus occurred.

Editorial note
--------------
This investigation documents, for the 1st time, serologic evidence for
transmission of YF vaccine virus through infected blood products. Before
this report, the risk for transmitting YF vaccine virus through blood
products was only theoretical. From this investigation, various blood
products, including irradiated platelets, appear capable of transmitting
the YF vaccine virus. Although irradiation can minimize
transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease, the dose is inadequate to
kill YF vaccine virus (A Barrett, University of Texas Medical Branch,
personal communication, 2009).

Of the 4 surviving blood product recipients, 3 had YFV-IgM and neutralizing
antibodies. The one surviving recipient who did not have serologic evidence
of exposures was a preterm infant. The 2 potential reasons for the lack of
detectable levels of YFV-IgM antibodies in the preterm infant are that the
infant's immune system was not mature enough to mount an adequate immune
response and lower levels of YF vaccine virus were present in red blood
cells compared with other serum-containing products. Despite evidence of
transmission of YF vaccine virus, no adverse events attributable to the
transfused virus were identified in the blood recipients. In addition,
these blood recipients were not ideal candidates for YF vaccination because
of age or compromised immune status.

Persons receiving their 1st dose of YF vaccine often will develop a
low-level viremia within 3-7 days after vaccination that persists for 1-3
days (4). As neutralizing antibody develops, viremia resolves. Neutralizing
antibody develops in 90 per cent of recipients within 10 days of
vaccination and in 99 per cent of recipients within 30 days (5). Immunity
lasts for at least 10 years (1). Persons receiving subsequent doses
typically do not develop viremia but might have an elevation in IgM
antibodies if several years have passed since their last vaccination (6).
YFV-IgM antibodies detected in the recipients might represent passive
immunization (that is, transfer of antibodies formed in the donor) rather
than transmission of vaccine virus via blood product. However, this
explanation is unlikely because all the donors were primary vaccine
recipients, and they would be expected to have viremia with low or
nonexistent levels of IgM antibodies at 4 days post-vaccination, when the
blood donation occurred (7,8). Detection of YF vaccine virus in the
original blood products or acute sera from recipients could have confirmed
vaccine virus transmission, but samples were unavailable to perform such
testing. Of the 3 recipients with positive YFV-IgM antibody titers, 2 who
had been vaccinated previously with YF vaccine more than 20 years earlier
likely had an anamnestic response to the vaccine virus in the blood
products. This immunologic response is consistent with reports that YFV-IgM
antibodies can reform after a booster dose of the vaccine, particularly
with longer time between vaccinations (6,8).

Transfusion-related transmission of attenuated YF vaccine virus is
preventable. Health care providers should inform persons receiving live
vaccines about the temporary deferral for blood donation. Providing
additional checks and balances is especially important when blood product
donors receive several vaccinations within a short period (for example, in
the case of active duty military personnel or travelers). If feasible,
occupational health personnel at military training facilities should
collaborate with the organizers of blood drives targeting military trainees
to coordinate a minimum 2-week interval separating receipt of live vaccines
and collection of blood products. All potential blood donors should be
individually screened for a recent history of receipt of vaccines
containing live virus during the month before donation, and temporary
deferment should be based upon the expected post-vaccination period of
viremia. Most temporary deferments due to receipt of live vaccines are 2
weeks; however, recipients of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines and
varicella vaccines should be deferred for 4 weeks because of the
theoretical risk for prolonged viremia.
