After 2 cases of Aujeszky's disease were notified by the French
authorities to the OIE, 3 more cases have been confirmed. All of them
are in the department of Pyrenees-Atlantiques, but in different
locations. The 1st 2 cases were at Alos-Sibas-Abense and Uhart-Cize,
and the last 3 were in Esterencuby, Saint-Etienne-de-Baigorry and
Saint-Jean-le-Vieux.

There have been no reported cases since 2009. Previously, between
2005 and 2009, none were confirmed. So far, 95 of the 96 French
departments are free of the disease, the exception being the
Department of Pyrenees-Atlantiques.
