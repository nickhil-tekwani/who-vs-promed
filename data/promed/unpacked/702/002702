The northern province of Yen Bai has announced that it has got
foot-and-mouth disease in cattle fully under control, as no new cases
have been reported over the past 20 days.

2 months ago [October 2009], the disease was first detected in Van
Chan district and rapidly spread to 9 communes infecting 218 cattle.
Subsequently, the district has made an all-out effort to prevent the
outbreak of the disease.

More than 63 000 cattle have so far been vaccinated in the surrounding
area, and more than 2000 litres of disinfectants have been provided to
framers to cleanse their cattle sheds.

[According to Viet Nam's monthly reports to SEAFMD (see further), 158
outbreaks of FMD have been recorded in Viet Nam since January 2009
until (including) November 2009, peaking during
August/September/October 2009. The monthly figures January-November
2009 were, respectively: 5, 3, 8, 2, 0, 0, 3, 40, 62, 29, 6. Of these,
80 were sampled and typed: 19 were serotyped A, 61 serotyped O. Though
serotype Asia1 is regarded endemic in Viet Nam as well, it has not
been recorded since July 2007. Additional data, including maps and
charts, can be found at the useful web-site of SEAFMD,
<http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php>.

The Southeast Asia Foot and Mouth Disease Campaign (SEAFMD) involves
the coordinated control of foot and mouth disease by 8 countries in
the ASEAN region. These countries are Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR,
Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. The
campaign is coordinated through an OIE (Office International des
Epizooties) Regional Coordination Unit in Bangkok with the support of
the Australian Government's overseas aid program, administered by
AusAID. - Mod.AS]
