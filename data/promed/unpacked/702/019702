SMALLPOX VACCINATION, ADVERSE EVENTS - USA (04)

To prevent lateral transmission of Vaccinia virus, I would recommend
using a "Haloplex" [ProMED-mail is not endorsing a specific
commercial product by posting this information. - Mod.MPP] square
(1-1/2 inches) over the gauze patch covering the inoculation site.
This followed by the usual semipermeable dressing. The Haloplex is
unique -- it is a solid sponge-like material that is medicated with a
patented material that can kill any Vaccinia virus that becomes
entrapped beyond a mylar circle at the center of Haloplex. With the
mylar center the "take" is assured, but zero lateral transmission
occurs. It also assures a safe disposal of used bandages.
In 1968, 2 studies looked at adverse reaction rates to the smallpox
vaccine and assessed risk of complications. Some of the serious
reactions affected 1 per 1000 people and involved a rash or
additional sore from touching the sore at the vaccination site.
Those studies recommended handwashing to reduce that complication.
Likewise damaged sight or blindness from contaminating the eyes with
the virus from the vaccine site was also reported. For about 3 weeks
after vaccination, patients are told to keep the vaccination site
covered with a gauze bandage and tape until the scab falls off.
Vaccinated people have to wash their hands often, especially after
changing their bandage, and avoid touching their vaccination site or
letting anyone else touch it. Used bandages are supposed to be sealed
off in a plastic bag and thrown out with the trash. This procedure
may be insufficient to prevent lateral transmission of the virus. The
Haloplex bandage provides a "tent of protection" over the vaccination
site but allows for the vaccine to have a good "take" while killing
any live virus that travels beyond the inoculation site on the
surface of the upper arm. Haloplex releases sufficient Iodine in a
designed ratio of HOI/I2 that optimally kills unwanted virus, thereby
protecting against inadvertent or lateral transmission of the virus
via the bandage. In addition, when the bandage needs to be changed,
the patient can simply place the Haloplex in a plastic "baggie" and
discard it with the trash with greater confidence that the virus will
be destroyed in the bag in addition to its destruction around the
site of vaccination. A new Haloplex bandage can then be applied to
the site. This process is to be repeated as needed until the scab
falls off.
The product is "new" and yet it is a time tested "old" product
(iodine) that has been "tamed" and complexed molecularly within a
solid polymer that is able to kill around the inoculation site
without affecting the "take". It is extraordinary. I first worked on
the bandage as a covering for cutaneous anthrax to prevent its spread
to medical personnel caring for such patients. The complex kills
anthrax spores. It kills the herpes virus which is as hearty as the
Vaccinia virus (same inhibitory concentration).
