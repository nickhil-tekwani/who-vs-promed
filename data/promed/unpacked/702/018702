A resident of Villabon, near Bourges, died of leptospirosis, also known as "rat disease". The 56-year-old man died at the end of September [2022]. He had taken part a few days earlier in the cleaning out of a stream and it seems he was infected by rat or nutria urine.

This disease affects around 600 people a year in France, and only 5 to 10% of cases are fatal, even though it's not clear why some patients develop a very severe form. Since 2014, the number of cases of leptospirosis has doubled in France. This might in part because the disease is better diagnosed today, in particular thanks to PCR tests, as for COVID-19.

The symptoms are comparable to those of the flu: "We know very well how to treat it with basic antibiotics," says Dr. Yves Guimard, infectious disease specialist at the Bourges hospital center. "Amoxicillin, in particular, works very well. " The problem is that sometimes people have very serious reactions, and despite antibiotic therapy, have serious forms. With infectious diseases, moreover we also see this with COVID-19, some people will present very weak symptoms and others, on the contrary, within the same family, will be severely affected without anyone really knowing why. The reaction varies greatly from one person to another."

Leptospirosis can reach the lungs, kidneys, infect the heart and the neurological system until the patient enters a coma. Even if severe cases are rare, it is better to protect yourself when you have to go into the water and you have wounds: "When the skin has lesions, or wounds, these bacteria, leptospirosis will take advantage of skin lesion to interfere in the body," says Dr. Guimard. "You must be careful and protect yourself well if you have wounds, in particular in your legs. I am thinking of fishermen or farmers who sometimes maintain their banks." Some professionals such as sewer workers, particularly at risk, are vaccinated against leptospirosis.

[Villabon (pop., 581 residents in 2019) is a farming village on the banks of the small Villabon river about 12mi (approx. 19km) east of Bourges, capital of the Cher department in the Centre-Val de Loire region in central France (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villabon). A map showing the location of Villabon can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/18800+Villabon,+France.

This news report serves as a reminder that any source of fresh (not salty) water (ponds, streams, lakes) can be contaminated with urine of _Leptospira_-infected animals. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira_. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, and swine) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.
