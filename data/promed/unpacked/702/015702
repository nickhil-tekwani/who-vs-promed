On [8 Mar 2014] _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated from the carcass of a pregnant cow in a herd of 144 head; there were 2 acute deaths, both with blood extravasation from the carcasses' natural openings. The herd had been vaccinated with Sterne vaccine some 150+ days earlier. Anthrax cases with confirmed diagnoses have been associated with the pasture the cows were grazing for some 6 years, that is, 2008-2014. It has natural grazing and streams of water. The carcass was disposed of using the "tapado controlado" technique, covered in lime and with a pegged down thick plastic tarpaulin for 9 months when it is just a hide and bones, which are then removed and incinerated.

The estancia [rural estate] is in the county (Partido) of Mar Chiquita, province of Buenos Aires, and within the control and surveillance area. This is separate from the January [2014] case in Partido Mar Chiquita.

[For some unexplained reason vaccination immunity is not as reliable as one would like in this Province. We have checked the quality of the Sterne vaccine used and it is normal. As a result a number of estancieros (ranch owners) vaccinate their stock multiple times for the summer. If anyone ever develops a better but as cheap vaccine, this is the part of the world to validate it in.
