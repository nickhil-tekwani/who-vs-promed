Herpes virus kills 860 tons of carp
-----------------------------------
About 860 tons of cultured carp have died since October in 2 lakes in
Ibaraki Prefecture from herpesvirus in the first such incident in Japan,
the prefectural government said on Sunday.
The carp began to die in early October 2003, and the number of deaths
jumped in the middle of the month, according to prefectural officials. The
virus has been detected in samples taken from the dead carp. The prefecture
has not been able to locate the route of infection. The damage from the
deaths of some 660 tons of carp in Lake Kasumigaura and another 200 tons in
Lake Kitaura is estimated at 150 million yen about USD 1 365 000], they said.
The virus cannot be transmitted to humans, and consumption of infected carp
would not have any ill effects, the officials said. The virus was first
detected in 1997 in Israel and has been found in Belgium, Britain, Germany,
Indonesia, the Netherlands, Taiwan, and the United States. In an attempt to
prevent infections, Japan has imposed restrictions on carp imports [until?]
14 Jul [2004?].

[Koi herpesvirus has been associated with devastating losses of common carp
(_Cyprinus carpio carpio_) and Koi (_Cyprinus carpio koi_) in North
America, Europe, Israel, and Asia. Koi carp are an ornamental variety of
carp propagated originally in ancient Rome and later for their aesthetic
appeal in Japan. In rent times they have been spread worldwide by
unregulated trade in ornamental fish. The herpesvirus isolated from Koi
carp, and currently designated Koi herpesvirus, is distinct from another
herpesvirus known as Cyprinid herpesvirus isolated from common carp. Both
viruses cause disease and economic loss in both subspecies of carp. The 2
herpesviruses are distinctive, however, in that Koi herpesvirus causes
significant economic losses among all ages of both common carp and Koi
carp, whereas cyprinid herpesvirus causes losses predominantly among fish
less than 2 months old.
Virus infections in poikilothermic vertebrates can be greatly influenced by
environmental temperatures. O Gilad and colleagues (J Gen Virol 2003;
84(10): 2661-7
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=13679599&dopt=Abstract>)
observed that optimal growth of Koi herpesvirus in a Koi fin cell line
occurred at temperatures from 15 to 25 degrees C. There was no growth or
minimal growth at 4, 10, 30, or 37 degrees C. Experimental infections of
Koi carp with Koi herpesvirus at a water temperature of 23 degrees C
resulted in a cumulative mortality of 95 per cent. Disease progressed
rapidly but with lower mortality (89 to 95 per cent) at 28 degrees C.
Mortality (85 per cent) also occurred at 18 degrees C but not at 13 degress
C. Shifting virus-exposed fish from 13 to 23 degrees C resulted in rapid
onset of mortality.
Gilad et al compared virion polypeptides and genomic restriction fragments
of 7 geographically diverse isolates of Koi herpesvirus and found that with
one exception they represented a homogeneous group. They concluded that a
single strain of Koi herpesvirus had been spread worldwide by the
unregulated trade in ornamental fish. They suggest that disease control
regulations should be implemented urgently in view of the importance of
common carp as a major protein source in some parts of the world. - Mod.CP]
