The Ebola outbreak left clinics in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone unable to perform routine vaccinations. This makes them vulnerable to a measles epidemic that could kill as many people as Ebola did, experts say. As people in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia begin to recover from last year's [2014] Ebola outbreak, a new menace is on the horizon: measles.

The 3 countries are facing a huge measles outbreak that could cause anywhere from 2000 to 16 000 additional deaths, according to a study published Thursday [12 Mar 2015]. Measles will have a much greater reach than usual because the Ebola crisis prevented health care workers from delivering routine vaccinations to children, the study found.

The scenario is not uncommon after humanitarian crises, when access to health care is cut off and malnutrition is widespread. Wars, natural disasters, and political upheavals are often followed by infectious disease outbreaks. Beginning last March [2014] in West Africa, "health care centers were closing, people weren't coming in because they were scared of the disease, and resources were all being diverted to fight the Ebola epidemic," Justin Lessler, assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University and lead author of the paper, told BuzzFeed News.

What's more, when people contract measles, they are more likely to die because of the widespread malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency associated with the Ebola outbreak, Lessler said. Lessler and his colleagues created a mathematical model that estimated that for each month of the Ebola outbreak, measles vaccinations in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia dropped by about 20 000 kids.

Based on forecasts of how long the Ebola outbreak will last, as well as where unvaccinated children live, the researchers determined that measles could infect 227 000 people, 100 000 more than would be expected if the Ebola outbreak hadn't happened. This could cause anywhere from 2000 to 16 000 additional deaths, a rate nearly 10 times worse than that of a healthy population with a stable health care system. "This commonly occurs after humanitarian crises, but this is particularly bad," said Lessler. "Our projections are fairly dire, I would say." More than 24 000 cases of Ebola have been documented in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, and nearly 10 000 people have died.

Case numbers have dropped substantially, from around 1000 a week at the outbreak's height to around 150 in recent reports. But the countries are still struggling to reassemble their fragmented health care systems. Liberia's president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, foresaw this problem when she declared a state of emergency in the country last summer. "The epidemic is having a chilling effect on the overall health care delivery," Sirleaf said. "Consequently, many common diseases ... may lead to unnecessary and preventable deaths."

Before the Ebola crisis hit, all 3 countries had been planning major measles vaccination campaigns, Lessler said. This is because measles vaccination rates had already been dropping in recent years, an ironic consequence of a decade of success. Between 1994 and 2003, the World Health Organization reported about 100 000 cases of measles across the 3 countries. Public health campaigns over the next decade lowered that to about 7000 cases, showing progress toward eliminating measles from the population. At the height of the campaigns, vaccination coverage reached nearly 90 percent of one-year-olds.

But after the success of this big push, vaccination campaigns became less of a priority. By 2013, immunization rates dropped to 73 percent. This could lead to what experts call a "post-honeymoon period outbreak," in which infection rates spike to dangerous levels because people aren't as vigilant about vaccinating.

"We do know that this is a real threat," Karen Grepin, assistant professor of global health policy at New York University, told BuzzFeed News. Grepin pointed out, however, that Lessler's forecasts make generalizations that might not accurately reflect variations in vaccination reductions, the length of time Ebola crushed the health care system in the countries, or behavior changes among the population, such as schools being closed and people going out much less than usual.

"It's just not clear what these numbers actually are," Grepin said. "[The study is] based on no real data in terms of what actually happened in the context of the crisis, but the answer is we don't know. We don't have better data."

Regardless of the specific numbers, the impending crisis highlights the need for immediate and aggressive vaccination campaigns across Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. "We'll need to focus on kids who missed their doses during this crisis, which might require some extra effort," Saad Omer, associate professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University, told BuzzFeed News. "It'll need more than just a resumption of previous activity."

Public health officials are also worried about new malaria and polio infections, and about people being adequately treated for chronic infections such as HIV and tuberculosis. All of this will require increased support from the international public health community. With measles, there's a relatively easy solution: a one-time, relatively cheap vaccine delivered to children. "We want to raise the awareness that the international community should not just be thinking about Ebola when they pour money into these countries right now but should also be thinking about the secondary health effects," Lessler said.

According to Grepin, planned interventions from organizations like UNICEF are already underway. "This is a very high priority," she said. The immunization campaigns "are planned, and they are going to happen." But it won't be easy, particularly because these countries are still staving off Ebola. It will take a delicate balancing of priorities, Omer said, but will ultimately require resilience on both fronts.

"If your job is to save lives, if a child dies of Ebola or dies of measles, there's no difference," Omer said. "At the end of the day, a child is dead."

The Ebola epidemic is by no means over, but it is being contained and controlled. With nearly 24 000 cases and more than 9800 fatalities so far -- mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia -- the epidemic is still claiming new victims, though more slowly. The crisis, however, has disrupted health-care delivery across the entire affected region, preventing children from receiving badly needed measles vaccines. That, the new study reports, could result in an additional 100 000 measles cases over the next 18 months, leading to an additional 2000 to 16 000 deaths. Rates of vaccination against other diseases -- particularly polio and tuberculosis -- have fallen too. But measles' ease of transmission makes it especially worrisome.

"When there's a disruption of medical services, measles is always one of the 1st ones in the door," says Justin Lessler, of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, a co-author of the paper. "The Ebola epidemic significantly increases the likelihood of a major measles outbreak occurring."

Lessler and his co-authors arrived at their numbers painstakingly. 1st, they used health data to map and estimate the share of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in 5 km by 5 km (3.1 mi. by 3.1 mi.) squares across the 3 affected countries. They then estimated a 75 percent reduction in vaccination rates during the epidemic and projected forward by 6, 12 and 18 months. They factored in the transmissibility of the virus within each region and estimated the likely number of deaths using what's known as a Case Fatality Ratio, a mathematical tool that, as its name suggests, estimates lethality for any particular disease under any particular set of circumstances.

The final numbers -- especially the potential 16 000 deaths -- rightly alarmed the researchers, though Lessler does admit that they are by no means a certainty. "The 75 percent decrease in vaccinations is a little too pessimistic," he concedes. But the critical word in that admission is "little," and the investigators did consider 25 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent rates too, before settling on 75 percent as at least the most plausible. No matter what, the odds are still high of a 5 figure death rate and a 5 to 6 figure additional case rate, and the Ebola epidemic, which led to the problem in the 1st place, has not even fully abated.

Lessler and his colleagues are not waiting until it does to sound the alarm, urging global health groups to mobilize a vaccination campaign now so it can be ready to launch in the affected areas the moment the Ebola all-clear sounds. The new push would 1st target children who were born during the Ebola epidemic since they would have likely received almost no medical attention at all up until that point, and then expand to all children in the most measles-susceptible age group, about 6 months to 5 years.

"The best time to start the campaign would be as soon as it's logistically feasible," says Lessler. "For every month that no campaign begins, the risk of an outbreak occurring and the impact of such an outbreak worsens."

The happy news, Lessler believes, is that done right, the campaign could not only prevent the measles epidemic from beginning but could actually put West Africa in a better position than it was before Ebola, with vaccine coverage for measles and other diseases exceeding the pre-outbreak rates. "Previous campaigns have reached coverage in excess of 90 percent," he says.

Victory in the battle against Ebola -- to say nothing of the battle against measles -- is by no means yet assured. But, again as the war colleges would teach, with the right cooperation and the right deployment, the good guys can win.

Public health officials in the Lanaudiere, northeast of Montreal, say there are now 80 confirmed cases of measles across the region. That's up from 10 cases just a month ago, and 25 cases less than 2 weeks ago. Health officials say the rapid spread comes as no surprise because the people who have become infected had not been vaccinated and were being followed closely because of the expectation that they would eventually contract the disease.

The outbreak was touched off in early February 2015 with the return of 10 people from 2 families who had traveled to Disneyland in California.

http://outbreaknewstoday.com/canada-lanaudiere-measles-outbreak-now-at-136-cases-lanaudiere-rougeole-43953/


The Public Health Department for the Lanaudiere region of Quebec confirms that 136 cases of measles have been reported as of Friday [13 Mar 2015]. This is up from 119 cases just a few days ago. Health officials expect the number of confirmed cases to increase as more contacts are monitored. In addition, they say the cases are all linked and are all unvaccinated people.

In neighboring Ontario, health minister Eric Hoskins said Thursday [12 Mar 2015]: "We are now ... measles free in the province." The incubation period for measles is between 7 and 21 days, with the last case being reported on 20 Feb 2015, CBC News reports. The latest measles data from Ontario has the case count at 18.

Measles is a highly contagious virus that lives in the nose and throat mucus of an infected person. It can spread to others through coughing and sneezing. Also, measles virus can live for up to 2 hours on a surface or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed, public health officials note. Symptoms of measles begin 7 - 21 days after exposure to a case of measles and include fever, runny nose, cough, drowsiness, irritability, and red eyes. Small white spots can appear on the inside of the mouth and throat, but are not always present. Then, 3 - 7 days after the start of the symptoms, a red blotchy rash appears on the face and then progresses down the body. Most people fully recover from measles within 2 to 3 weeks. But measles can sometimes cause complications, such as pneumonia, hearing loss, brain swelling (encephalitis), seizures, or, very rarely, even death.

Measles can be prevented with immunization. Two measles-containing vaccines are available; a combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine and a combined measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV) vaccine. The MMR and MMRV vaccines are part of the routine publicly funded vaccines available free in Canada.

[5] Canada (Quebec) - all cases related

http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-measles-outbreak-grows-to-119-confirmed-cases-including-student-1.2990192


Up to 700 students and staff members are potentially at risk of contracting measles after a student attended the school while contagious. The elementary school has a pre-kindergarten program, meaning children as young as 4 attend the school. Public health officials in Quebec's Lanaudiere region said all of the 119 measles cases are tied to the outbreak at Disneyland. Three pavilions at the school are concerned: Wilfrid Gervais, St-Pierre and Marie-Charlotte.

The school says vaccinate or stay away. The protocol involves identifying all the unvaccinated people at the school and offering them the vaccine. 51 staff and 114 students were identified on Tuesday [10 Mar 2015] as not being fully vaccinated and health authorities began contacting them. All staff and students will have their vaccination records checked; information will be offered to parents, and vaccinations will be offered Thursday [12 Mar 2015]. Anyone who refuses to be vaccinated will be required to stay home for 2 weeks.

"I invite the people, the parents to make sure their children are vaccinated. It's a protection for their child, but for all the people around," said Public Health Minister Lucie Charlebois. However, Charlebois said that since 91 per cent of the region's general population is supposedly vaccinated, the school is better protected than the group affected by the outbreak.

Yesterday [10 Mar 2015], officials with the Lanaudiere public health department announced there were 80 confirmed cases of measles in the region. All of the people infected with the disease were unvaccinated.

The 1st Quebecers to contract measles were exposed while visiting Disneyland in California. Public health officials said Wednesday [11 Mar 2015] that all of the 119 cases are related. The confirmed cases are children or adults from the same religious community called L'esprit Saint, who were not vaccinated. A member of the L'esprit Saint religious community told the CBC that their prophet warns against vaccines, claiming they can lead to serious illnesses.

[6] Canada (vaccination skepticism)
Date: 9 Mar 2015
Source: IB Times [edited]
http://www.ibtimes.com/measles-outbreak-canada-anti-vaccination-parents-wont-change-minds-poll-finds-1840398


An outbreak of measles won't change some Canadian parents' minds about vaccinations, highlighting the ongoing mistrust among so-called anti-vaxxers about the safety and efficacy of modern vaccines. A survey of more than 1013 Canadians who chose not to inoculate their children against measles found that over 3/4ths of them said it was "not at all likely" that recent outbreaks in the country would lead them to vaccinate their kids, according to the latest polling, released Monday [9 Mar 2015], from Mainstreet Technologies.

"Despite the fact that measles has regularly been in the news over the past 2 months, nearly 80 percent of respondents still say they are not at all likely to vaccinate their children," Mainstreet Technologies President Quito Maggi said in a statement. "This is a continuing problem for those who cannot be vaccinated and depend on herd immunity for coverage."

39 percent of respondents to the survey who said they would not vaccinate their kids were from households with incomes over USD 100 000, and 38 percent held a university degree. The majority -- 65 percent -- cited health reasons for choosing not to vaccinate. One out of 5 respondents mentioned religious reasons. Health officials in Canada recently confirmed 10 cases of measles in Quebec related to an outbreak of the disease that began at the Disneyland theme park in Anaheim, California, in December 2014.

Public opinion polling from February 2015 showed that a vast majority of Canadians said they believe that vaccines are effective at preventing disease. The survey found that younger respondents, people aged 18 to 34, were more skeptical of vaccines' efficacy.

Measles continues to affect countries across the world from Africa to Europe, Asia and North America. Lower immunization rates in countries like Ethiopia and China caused the number of measles cases there to soar to the tens of thousands over the past several years, according to the World Health Organization. Europe has had more than 22 000 measles cases in 2014 and 2015.

Recent outbreaks of measles in North America have done little to change the minds of B.C. parents who've chosen not to have their children vaccinated, according to a new poll. The survey from Mainstreet Technologies, an Ontario-based research firm, found that 80 per cent of anti-vaccine parents in B.C. are "not at all likely" to vaccinate their children, despite the resurgence of measles this winter [2014-15].

"This is a continuing problem for those who cannot be vaccinated and depend on herd immunity for coverage," Mainstreet president Quito Maggi said in a press release.

Pollsters spoke to 1013 Canadian parents of children between the ages of one and 14 who have not been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, and found that health concerns were the biggest factor in the decision not to vaccinate. 63 per cent of B.C. parents surveyed cited health concerns as a reason not to vaccinate, while 24 per cent pointed to religious reasons.

Education and income don't seem to play a big role in the vaccination decision, according to the pollsters. 39 per cent of anti-vaccination parents come from households earning more than USD 100 000 annually, and 38 per cent hold a university degree.

The survey was conducted by an interactive voice recording between 22-28 Feb 2015. The results have a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.08, 19 times out of 20.

http://www.mercurynews.com/health/ci_27659828/measles-outbreak-bay-area-day-cares-show-high?source=infinite


With new measles cases continuing to surface every week, Bay Area parents are still on high alert. While much of the recent attention has focused on kindergartners who aren't fully immunized, preschools and day cares may also be beds of infection, state data show. In Santa Clara County, 12 percent of preschoolers and day care kids 2 and older were not up-to-date on their shots at the beginning of this school year. In Alameda County, more than 9 percent of preschoolers were not fully immunized, and some reports from individual preschools showed far higher rates of under-vaccinated children.

Vaccines are ready to be administered at the Family Justice Center clinic in Oakland, Calif., on Thu 26 Feb 2015. According to health officials, diseases such as measles, chicken pox and others are making a comeback. Statewide, only 89.4 percent of kids at childcare facilities were fully immunized when they started last fall [2014]. That's below the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended vaccination rate of 92-95 percent to create "herd immunity," which experts say protects a community from infectious diseases. In addition, the 89.4 percent figure reflects only schools that reported their rates. Statewide, 12 percent of childcare facilities failed to submit their required reports last fall [2014]. By the time a child is 18 months old, he or she should have received 3 doses of the polio vaccine, 4 doses against whooping cough, one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, one dose of Hib, 3 doses for hepatitis B and one dose against chickenpox. While day cares and preschools may admit younger children, the state immunization data count only those between the ages of 2 and 4 years, 11 months.

Four Alameda County schools -- the KinderCare Learning Center, Precious Time Christian Preschool, Valley Christian Preschool and Peace Terrace Academy -- reported that none of their children was completely up-to-date on required immunizations as of the start of this school year. Countywide, 7.55 percent of Alameda County's preschool kids were under-vaccinated, entering school as "conditional entrants," with immunizations started but not completed. And that does not include an additional 1.71 percent of county preschoolers who were unvaccinated because their parents sought "personal belief exemptions," or the 0.39 percent of kids with medical exemptions.

In Santa Clara County, 9.42 percent of preschoolers started the school year as conditional entrants; 2.06 percent were unvaccinated due to personal belief exemptions, and 0.45 percent were unvaccinated because of permanent medical exemptions.

Santa Cruz County, long a hotbed of parents who refuse to vaccinate their children, stands out with 23 percent of its preschoolers and day care kids lacking complete immunizations. St. Andrew's Preschool reported just one of its 18 students with complete vaccinations at the start of this school year [2014], while at Montessori Scotts Valley, only 4 of its 29 students were vaccination-compliant. At Santa Cruz Toddler Care Center, 2 of its 11 students were up-to-date. Statewide, 7.40 percent of preschoolers started the year as "conditional entrants."

"Seeing some with such high rates says to me it's an education and training issue more than anything," said Amy Pine, director of the immunization program for the Alameda County Public Health Department. "When you become a childcare provider, you are given a list of requirements that you have to fulfill that includes 'check immunization records,' but you're not necessarily trained in how to fulfill those requirements."

Pine has made it her mission to bring up immunization rates in Alameda County. She's focusing specifically on the high number of "conditional entrants" in kindergarten, helping schools to follow up with kids whose shots are due. Students may enter school on a conditional basis if they have received at least one dose of each required vaccination and are not yet due for subsequent doses. The condition is that they get up-to-date as soon as the shots are due. A Southern California lawmaker this week introduced a bill that would require all childcare and preschool workers to get vaccinated against measles, pertussis, influenza and other diseases. "We must do everything in our power to protect California's children who spend time in day care," Sen. Tony Mendoza, D-Artesia, said.

In addition to these high rates of unimmunized and under-immunized kids, some Bay Area preschools did not even submit the mandated report to the California Department of Public Health in the fall [2014]. In fact, more than 10 percent of facilities in both Alameda and Santa Clara counties did not submit a report at all. Those schools will have to wait until the next school year to correct the record. "There is not a way for them to submit their information to the state once all of the deadlines have passed," Pine said. "All that we did this year [2015] was instruct them that this is their obligation and they must submit the information next year." To motivate schools to report, Pine hopes the state will change the designation from "did not report" to "noncompliant."

Still, the state has no teeth to force childcare facilities and preschools to report their vaccination rates. The California Department of Public Health "does not have enforcement authority over these state statutes and regulations," Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the department, said. Instead, he said, the department notifies the state Department of Social Services of the child care facilities that fail to submit reports and then notifies those facilities that the Department of Public Health has reported them.

Percentage of children entering day care with all the required immunizations for the current school year [2014-15]:
Statewide: 89.37 percent
San Mateo County: 93.43 percent
Contra Costa County: 92.38 percent
Alameda County: 90.35 percent
San Francisco County: 89.94 percent
Santa Clara County: 88.07 percent
Santa Cruz County: 76.48 percent

Percentage of childcare facilities who reported their vaccination rates to the state in the fall [2014]:
Statewide: 87.99 percent
San Mateo County: 99.61 percent
San Francisco County: 97.05 percent
Contra Costa County: 96.83 percent
Santa Clara County: 90.02 percent

[9] USA (CDC) update)
Date Tue 10 Mar 2015

http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html


From Jan 1 to Mar 6 2015, 173 people from 17 states and the District of Columbia were reported to have measles [AZ (7), CA (115), CO (1), DC (2), DE (1), GA (1), IL (15), MI (1), MN (1), NE (2), NJ (2), NY (3), NV (9), PA (1), SD (2) TX (1), UT (2), WA (7)]*. Most of these cases [127 cases (73 percent)] are part of a large, ongoing multi-state outbreak linked to an amusement park in California.

2015 measles cases in the U.S., 1 Jan to 6 Mar 2015 [Accompanied by a color coded map of the USA, which indicates in shades of light to dark blue the number of cases]. Twelve states (Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah) and the District of Columbia have 1 to 4 cases. Three states (Arizona, Nevada and Washington) have 5 to 9 cases. One state (Illinois) has 10 to 19 cases, and one state (California) has 20 or more cases. These are provisional data reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. [CDC will update these data weekly on Mondays.]

The United States experienced a record number of measles cases during 2014, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000.

Measles cases and outbreaks 1 Jan to 6 Mar 2015: 173 cases reported in 17 states and District of Columbia: Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Washington, with 4 outbreaks representing 90 percent of reported cases this year [2015].

The majority of people who got measles were unvaccinated.

Measles is still common in many parts of the world including some countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S. Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

Measles Outbreaks
-----------------
U.S. Multi-state measles outbreak, 28 Dec 2014 - 6 Mar 2015: From 28 Dec 2014-6 Mar 2015, 142 people from 7 states were reported to have measles and are considered to be part of a large, ongoing outbreak linked to an amusement park in California. A map of the U.S. indicates in shades of light pink to dark magenta the number of cases. Five states have 1-4 cases (specifically, Colorado and Oregon - 1; Nebraska and Washington - 2; and Utah - 3). One state has 5 to 9 cases (Arizona - 7). One state has 20 or more cases (California--126). These are provisional data reported to CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

The United States is currently experiencing a large, multi-state outbreak of measles linked to an amusement park in California. Outbreaks in countries to which Americans often travel can directly contribute to an increase in measles cases in the U.S.

Reasons for an increase in cases some years:
------------------------------
2015: The United States is currently experiencing a large, multi-state measles outbreak linked to an amusement park in California. Three other unrelated outbreaks are occurring in Illinois, Nevada, and Washington respectively.

2014: The U.S. experienced 23 measles outbreaks in 2014, including one large outbreak of 383 cases, occurring primarily among unvaccinated Amish communities in Ohio. Many of the cases in the U.S. in 2014 were associated with cases brought in from the Philippines, which experienced a large measles outbreak.

The U.S. experienced 11 outbreaks in 2013, 3 of which had more than 20 cases, including an outbreak with 58 cases.

2011: In 2011, more than 30 countries in the WHO European Region reported an increase in measles, and France was experiencing a large outbreak. Most of the cases that were brought to the U.S. in 2011 came from France. For more information see Measles -- United States, January-20 May 2011.

2008: The increase in cases in 2008 was the result of spread in communities with groups of unvaccinated people. The U.S. experienced several outbreaks in 2008 including 3 large outbreaks. For more information, see Update: Measles -- United States, January-July 2008.

See also: The Surveillance Manual chapter on measles that describes case investigation, outbreak investigation, and outbreak control for additional information. During the 1st 8 months of 2013, 159 people in the United States were reported to have measles; MMWR. Vol 62, No 36;752-3 09/13/2013.

Laboratory specimens of another suspected measles case were sent to the State Public Health Laboratory in Seattle on 11 Mar 2015 for testing. The latest case is an adult relative of 2 earlier cases who was thought to be immune to measles. Clallam County Health and Human Services is treating the case as measles with quarantine and examining who the person came into contact with recently.

Previously, a suspected 5th case of the measles in Clallam County turned out to be a patient getting a rash, a reaction to receiving the measles vaccine. According to Jeanette Stehr-Green, Clallam County interim health officer, about one in 20 (5 percent) of people who are vaccinated with the measles vaccine (MMR) develop a skin rash.

The measles case count in Clallam County remains at 4 confirmed cases. The 2 most recent cases of measles in the county were identified before they were contagious, and they stayed home the whole time to reduce the chance of additional exposures to unvaccinated persons. Health care staff and local health care providers have vaccinated hundreds of children and adults in the past 3 weeks, she said, so health officials were not surprised by this occurrence.

"Because of the recent cases of measles in our community, we had to treat this rash as if it were a case," Stehr-Green said. "Measles is highly contagious even before the rash starts and is easily spread when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. If you are not vaccinated, you can get measles just by walking into a room where someone with the disease has been in the past couple of hours." Once recognized, Stehr-Green said, the patient with the potential measles case was in quarantine while specimens were tested at the Washington State Public Health Laboratory and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"Measles can be serious, and some of our most vulnerable neighbors cannot be vaccinated, including babies and pregnant women. It is vital that the rest of us help protect ourselves, our families and our community," Stehr-Green said. "The possibility of a mild reaction should not discourage people from getting vaccinated. The benefits of vaccination for both the individual and the community substantially outweigh the occasional reaction to the vaccine."

Fever and a rash are the most common side effects of the vaccine, she said. Persons who develop a rash in response to the measles vaccine are not contagious.

[11] USA (California - Disneyland update)

The measles outbreak linked to a Disneyland guest who visited the Anaheim theme park in December 2014 appears to have peaked, with only one new case reported Friday [13 Mar 2015] by state health officials. Since 27 Feb 2015, only 3 new cases have been reported in the state. The latest -- the 133rd case -- was reported in Ventura County, the state Department of Public Health announced. Initially, it did not look like a case of the measles, and the patient had to be tested again to confirm the diagnosis, said Sheila Murphy of the Ventura County Health Care Agency, bringing the county's total to 13.

The most recent figures show 33 cases in Los Angeles County, including 2 in Long Beach and 4 in Pasadena, which have their own health departments. Orange County stands at 35 cases and Riverside County has had 8 cases. San Bernardino County has a dozen, and San Diego County has 14.

Of the California cases, 40 were traced back to visitors or workers at Disneyland between 17-20 Dec 2014, according to the state. In 30 cases, measles was passed on from someone in the house or another close relation, officials said. 11 people contracted the disease in a community setting such as an emergency room where someone was seeking treatment for measles.

In 49 cases, including the latest one, it's unknown how the disease was contracted. Of the patients the state has vaccination records for, 57 did not get shots, and 20 had one or more doses of the MMR vaccine, according to the state.

There are 173 cases reported in 17 states this year [2015], according to the Centers for Disease Control. Measles cases have been reported in Washington, D.C., Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Washington. The outbreaks in Illinois, Washington state and Nevada are unrelated to Disneyland, according to the CDC.

From 28 Dec to 6 Mar 2015, 142 people from 7 states came down with measles from the Disneyland outbreak. The states include Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska, Oregon, Utah and Washington state, according to the CDC. There were 644 measles cases in 27 states, the most since measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, according to the CDC. In most cases, the victims were unvaccinated, according to the CDC.

The CDC reported on 13 Feb 2015, when there were 110 cases of measles, 45 percent were unvaccinated; 5 percent had one dose, and 6 percent had 2 doses, and only one person had 3 doses. 12 of those afflicted with measles were too young to get shots, and of those who were eligible to get shots, 28 intentionally took a pass based on personal beliefs, and one had an "alternative plan" for immunization, according to the CDC. Of the 28 who did not get vaccinated, 18 were children and the rest adults, according to the CDC.

The patients have ranged in age from 6 weeks to 70 years, with the median age 22, according to the CDC. Experts suspect the outbreak started with a traveler who got infected overseas and then visited Disneyland while infectious, according to the CDC. Scientists say the measles virus in this outbreak matches the one in an outbreak in the Philippines last year [2014].

The Canterbury District Health Board is urging parents to immunise their children following a Christchurch child being confirmed as having measles last week. The child had had a 1st dose of measles vaccine but had not yet had the 2nd dose due at 4 years of age.

Dr Daniel Williams, Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, says advice has been given to parents at the 2 preschools the child attends. "The advice urges parents who have not immunised their children to do so. People who choose not to vaccinate their children against infectious diseases are putting not only their own children at risk, but also other people's children," Dr Williams says.

Community and Public Health are continuing to contact trace to determine the source of the child's infection. At this stage, the source remains unknown. Dr Williams says the fact the child received one dose of vaccine has helped reduce the severity of symptoms, with just a mild illness.

While the measles vaccine is highly effective, as long as the disease is circulating, it remains a threat to everyone, as no vaccine is 100 percent effective all the time. That's why we need to keep lifting our rates of immunisation across the board if we are to be successful in eradicating measles. New Zealand's target for immunisation coverage is 95 percent of children fully immunised by 8 months and then at 2 years of age. Canterbury has 93 percent coverage for 8 month olds and has achieved the 95 percent target for 2 year olds.

"Immunisation can protect people against harmful diseases, which can cause serious complications, including death. It is one of the most effective, and cost-effective medical interventions to prevent disease," Dr Williams says. "To be best-protected, babies, children and adults all need to be immunised on time, every time. While it is best to immunise on time, every time, it is never too late to start."
