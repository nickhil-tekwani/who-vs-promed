The dreaded Japanese encephalitis [JE] virus is lurking in Bhopal, adding an ominous threat to a city reeling from unprecedented spread of dengue, chikungunya and swine flu this year [2017].

There, 2 persons have tested positive for JE [virus] infection, where the mortality rate is as high as 30 percent, triggering vector-control drives in 4 localities. "JE has been confirmed in 2 cases. As per protocol, measures have been taken to curtail spread of the disease," said MP health director Dr K L Sahu, as reported by TOI.

According to the newspaper, both patients are in Bhopal. The 1st case was reported about a fortnight ago from Saket Nagar. The patient, a 10-year-old child, suffered a mild infection and thankfully did not have any risky symptoms apart from fever and headache. The 2nd patient, a girl, is also a 10-year-old and lives in Tilajamalpura, about 12 km [7 miles] from Saket Nagar.

[ProMED-mail has posted relatively few cases of JE in Madhya Pradesh state. The last one was on 24 Dec 2011. In that report over 140 people had died due to encephalitis at a government hospital in Indore in the previous 8 months.

Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species (mainly _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_). The virus exists in an endemic transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and water birds.
