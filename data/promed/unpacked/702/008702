A crocodile vet from South Africa has put forward a new theory about
why thousands of Northern Territory crocodiles are dying. A disease
has been decimating stocks of crocodile hatchlings since it was
discovered in June [2006].
Crocodile experts have been struggling to diagnose the disease which
causes the young saltwater crocodiles to suffocate.
Crocodile vet Fritz Huchzermeyer flew into Darwin to investigate and
says the crocodiles could be suffering from a form of pox virus that
has hit captive reptiles in South Africa. But he says until there is
a firm diagnosis, the focus will have to be on preventing the disease
from spreading. "The main thing is really to jack up the hygiene," he said.
Dr Huchzermeyer says it was originally thought the crocodiles were
dying from chlamydia but the disease is not following the usual patterns.
"Here we have conjunctivitis, no hepatitis, high mortality, no
response or hardly any response to antibiotics, and this puzzled us
no end," he said.

The vet heading the investigation into a disease that has killed
thousands of the Northern Territory's crocodiles says it is a strain
of chlamydia.
Ian Jerrett says electron microscope screenings have ruled out a
theory that the disease could be a form of pox virus.
Scientists are now trying to pinpoint whether the strain is unique to
saltwater crocodiles. More than 3000 crocodile hatchlings have died
of the disease since it was detected in June. Samples from the dead
animals have been sent to Queensland and Victoria for testing. Mr
Jerrett says the results should reveal whether the crocodiles caught
the disease from birds.
"We're comparing the actual DNA profile or the DNA fingerprint of the
chlamydia, with chlamydia in other animals such as in birds and we'll
be able to tell whether this matches any one or whether this is a
unique species to the crocodile," he said.

provide interesting contrast. Clearly we will have to wait on
definitive results from the laboratory. - Mod.TG]
