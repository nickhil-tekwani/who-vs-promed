Doctors say 33 die of Rift Valley fever in Egypt
------------------------------------------------
CAIRO: Some 33 people in the Nile Delta governorate of Kafr el-Sheikh have
died of Rift Valley fever, a viral disease which affects humans as well as
livestock, doctors in the region said on Sunday.

The news comes about a week after Health and Population Minister Mohamed
Awad Afifi Tag el-Din said an outbreak of the fever in Kafr el-Sheikh had
been brought under control, after 4 out of 35 people diagnosed with the
fever had died.

Medical sources in the governorate could not say on Sunday how many people
in the province had caught the disease so far.

Rift Valley fever is primarily transmitted to humans through mosquito
bites, and is particularly common during years with unusually heavy
rainfall. Saudi Arabia, an importer of Egyptian livestock, has announced a
temporary ban on the import of live goats, sheep, camels and gazelles from
Egypt due to reports of the disease.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of
domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a
mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in
climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is
characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats
and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high
mortality rate in the newborn. Humans are susceptible to infection by
handling infected material and through transmission by mosquito vectors.

Egypt was the first country to be affected by RVF outside sub-Saharan
Africa, namely in 1977, suffering one of the most devastating outbreaks in
the history of the disease. The last Egyptian reporting to the OIE on the
occurrence of RVF in animals was in July 1993; mass vaccinations in
ruminants are carried out annually, their number in 2001 reaching 5 994
818. The main vector in Egypt was reported to be _Culex pipiens_. During
2000/2001, the disease spread, most probably from the Horn of Africa, into
Yemen and Saudi Arabia.

Information on the occurrence of the disease in domestic ruminants in Egypt
will be useful. - Mod. AS].
