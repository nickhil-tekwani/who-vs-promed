At least 20 dogs are being shot daily in Masvingo in a controversial operation by the town council, police, and veterinary services to curb the spread of anthrax, it emerged on Monday [27 Feb 2012].

Since 13 Feb 2012, police sharp shooters accompanied by municipal security guards have been mowing down unaccompanied dogs. But some residents complain that their dogs have been shot indiscriminately during the exercise, which will run until 14 Mar 2012.

The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) has admitted that it was on board with the operation. The organisation, which traditionally offers refuge to stray animals, says lack of funding has curtailed its work. John Chikomo, the SPCA'S regional manager for Masvingo, said they were against "indiscriminate shooting of stray dogs", but said they were powerless to stop the exercise because they lacked an alternative strategy to the one pursed by local authorities owing to "resource challenges".

A resident of the Rhodene neighbourhood, told how his dog was shot after it strayed meters from his yard. "That is cruelty of the highest order, and I wonder what SPCA is doing in that taskforce," he said.

One resident from Mucheke suburb told how his dog jumped a perimeter wall to mate with a bitch that was on heat next door. "That is when it met its fate as municipal police met the dogs outside and opened fire without even talking to the owners. They killed 6 dogs on the spot," [he] claimed.

Provincial veterinary chief Ernest Dzimwazha said residents had been given advance warning to keep their dogs contained to allow them to rid the city of stray animals. He said: "We put notices in all schools and council office notice boards. For the residents to complain that they have been caught unaware is not being honest. We will continue shooting these stray dogs as a measure to contain anthrax in the city." He said Masvingo had the highest number of reported anthrax cases countrywide. Stray dogs posed a danger to city residents as they regularly came into contact with wild animals on the city's fringes.

Dzimwazha said there was always the option to vaccinate the dogs, but said it would cost USD 100 per dog -- money that neither the council nor central government had. "There is a real risk of these stray dogs spreading anthrax to our pets and obviously city residents. If an individual doesn't get treated within a period of 3 weeks, death will be apparent," he said.

According to council bylaws, residents in high density suburbs are allowed to keep only 2 dogs while those in the low density suburbs should keep a maximum of 4 dogs per household.

[Shooting stray dogs is an accepted control procedure for urban rabies and has been successfully used for decades. Stray dog control has no part in anthrax control. If the area is littered with the carcasses of dead livestock and there are problems with their proper disposal, I can see an argument being made for stopping the dogs scavenging the carcasses, but then there are the vultures, which will be efficiently doing that anyway.

The cost of vaccinating a dog with Sterne will be the same as that for cattle, about USD 40 cents/head. Rabies vaccination is more expensive but when I was at PANAFTOSA in the '70s Brazil was running a very efficient and cost effective urban rabies control and eradication programme and it could not have cost USD 100/dog or the equivalent then. It was pennies per dog.

Dzimwazha is correct in that Masvingo is a chronically anthrax affected province.
