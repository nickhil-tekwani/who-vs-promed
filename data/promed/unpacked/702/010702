The most likely scenario is that this woman had _Clostridium tetani_
on her skin at the time of the injection. Alcohol (if used to clean
the skin prior to the injection) will not kill _Clostridium_ species.
Tetanus has occurred in injection drug users; see:
Thomas RM, Bellamy MC: Tetanus in a subcutaneous drug abuser:
ineffectiveness of intrathecal baclofen. Anaesth Intensive Care.
2006; 34: 811-5. [Abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=17183905>.
- CopyEd.MJ]
In addition, if the injection contained anything that would cause
vasoconstriction (such as epinephrine), it would set up anaerobic
conditions that would enhance the risk of disease with _Clostridium_.
This has occurred with _Clostridium perfringens_ after injections of
epinephrine/adrenaline; see:
Hallagan LF, Scott JL, Horowitz BC, Feied CF: Clostridial myonecrosis
resulting from subcutaneous epinephrine suspension injection. Ann
Emerg Med. 1992; 21: 434-6. [Abstract available at

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Harriman for her comments regarding
injection-induced clostridial diseases. The widespread distribution
of hardy spores of the organisms in the environment is always an
issue. It is also possible that the injected material was the culprit
itself, or even the syringe. - Mod.LL]

Dolo-Neurobion (probably (R)) would be a good explanation for the
trade name you mention. Neurobion (R) a Merck product containing
vitamins B1, B6, and B12. I recall Dolo-Neurobion to be on the German
market, as well, which did contain an analgesic, possibly Metamizol.
Such combinations of Metamizol plus X were later banned to curb the
risk of bone marrow toxicity of Metamizol (thought to be given
excessively, as in many cases only the other components were wanted).
Such drugs, often with old brand names, do circulate a lot in poorer
countries, where medication is often polypragmatic. This comment does
not help to elucidate the tetanus problem, but may lower the
"publication threshhold". Be sure to write a case report!
