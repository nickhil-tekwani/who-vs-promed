The number of polio cases reported in Sindh this year [2019] has gone up to 14 as the Emergency Operation Centre [EOC] for Polio has confirmed a new case.

A 9-month-old boy from Larkana has contracted polio. According to EOC officials, the polio case surfaced in Larkana's UC Karani on [9 Nov 2019].

According to his parents, the child received 4 doses of the oral polio vaccine during a campaign and 3 doses during routine vaccination.

Officials say the poliovirus in the environment in Karachi and other parts of Sindh must be dealt with.

The National Institute of Health [Wed 4 Dec 2019] notified 2 more polio affected children from Lakki Marwat and DI Khan districts taking the total case count to 68 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the current year [2019].

In a press statement, Coordinator EOC Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Abdul Basit said one wild poliovirus has been isolated from a stool sample of an 18-month-old male child from union council Kirri Shamozai, Tehsil Parova District DI Khan and a 4-month-old male child from UC Titter Khel, Tehsil Sarai Norgang, District Lakki Marwat. The epidemiological study of the children shows that both children were zero dose for essential immunization while their SIAs history is under investigation. Abdul Basit has shown a strong exception to the sharp increase in polio cases in the province especially from the southern belt saying that it was unfortunate that 68 children are disabled for life.

He said that the virus was on fire in the province specifically in the southern belt and is present in the environment that will hit any un-vaccinated or immune-compromised child. Despite the fact that vaccine is available to prevent children from the disease yet parents were not vaccinating their children due to misconceptions and were responsible for the disability of the children, he added. He said that the only viable solution to the problem is to vaccinate children under 5 [years] in every campaign as only repeated doses can protect the child from permanent disability and stop virus circulation in the environment.

One fresh polio case had been detected in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province, a local newspaper reported on [Mon 2 Dec 2019].

"With this new case, the total number of polio cases in 2019 reaches 22 in the country. The latest polio case has been reported from Kandahar city, capital of Kandahar province which permanently paralyzed an 18-month-old child," Daily Afghanistan-e-Ma reported.

The paper added that polio is a crippling and potentially fatal infectious disease.

"Most of the Afghan children affected by poliovirus this year [2019] are living in areas where kids do not have access to health facilities and regular anti-polio vaccination campaign. However, this time a child has been affected in a large city where anti-polio vaccination had been conducted repeatedly this year," the report said.

There is no cure for polio and the polio vaccine is the only safe and effective way to protect children.

The ongoing conflicts have been hindering the efforts to stamp out the infectious disease in the mountainous country.

[The addition of 3 newly confirmed cases of polio (all 3 due to WPV1, as per End Polio Pakistan https://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-in-provinces) in Pakistan and one newly confirmed case of polio in Afghanistan brings the total number of WPV1 associated cases with date of onset in 2019 to 116 (94 in Pakistan and 22 in Afghanistan). The key question here is whether Afghanistan and Pakistan, with all the challenges in vaccinating the susceptible populations due to a variety of anti-vaccination impediments, will be able to interrupt transmission of the WPV1 in both countries simultaneously.
