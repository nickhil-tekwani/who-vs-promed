The decision of Melilla authorities to ban the import of Moroccan sheep for Eid El Kebir [Festival of Sacrifice] divides political parties and concerned families, the majority of them with modest incomes.

Moroccan sheep are designated "bestia non grata" in Melilla. The department in charge of Health has banned the import of sheep from the kingdom because of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD]. This will apply over the next 2 years and "will serve to enhance the level of food security and health," says the department in charge of Health. In fact, this decision comes from the European authorities.

However, this measure does not have unanimous support among the Muslim population. To reassure the Muslim community, the President of the Government, Juan Imbroda, has dangled the business potential of this measure to the merchants of the city, and "gains for Spain."

The Chief of the Popular Party said that about 5000 head of sheep will be transported from the Iberian Peninsula to meet the demand of the Muslim population of the enclave. Imbroda believes that the supply of sheep will not be a problem; however, an FMD outbreak "can be a real problem for Melilla." However, the decision to import a sheep population of the peninsula will drive up prices, while the prices of Moroccan origin sheep are more competitive and more accessible to all budgets.

To this end, the Socialist Party [PSOE] of Melilla criticized the measure and called for the intensification of veterinary security and border controls instead of closing them and deprive low-income families of this important religious holiday. The PSOE spokesman in the Assembly of Melilla recalled that for many years, veterinary services have detected cases of bluetongue disease, and controls have been strengthened without proceeding to prohibit access to this animal species. This sanitary prohibition at 1st glance has, for the enclave Muslims, a crucial importance and may revive the feeling of discrimination and marginalization they say they are victims of.

Indeed, the Muslim community of the enclave appeals to the local government to put in place an infrastructure to improve the conditions for celebration of this religious festival. The political representative of the Muslim community believes that the enclave should develop its livestock operation, like Ceuta, to become independent of the Moroccan livestock.

[At about 6 months from Eid El Kebir, the authorities of the Autonomous City of Melilla decided to ban the import of sheep from Morocco. This raised the protests of the Muslim population of the enclave because, besides the relatively low price of these animals compared to those imported from the Iberian peninsula, their meat is prized for its organoleptic (taste, sight, smell, and touch) characteristics.

The Muslim population of Melilla consists of Berber of Spanish and Moroccan origins, totaling together nearly half of the approximately 100 000 inhabitants of the city (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla in French).

These people are demanding the introduction of sheep farming units in the enclave, like those installed in Ceuta, the other Spanish enclave in Morocco. - Mod.AB]

The serotype O lineage (called O/ME-SA/Ind-2001) which is behind the epizootic in Morocco (since October 2015) has continued (in January 2016) to spread simultaneously in the Gulf States of the Middle East and North Africa. This strain has become, during recent years, the dominant FMDV lineage present in the Indian sub-continent. During 2013-15, it was detected in UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, spreading in a westerly direction across North Africa from Libya into Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco. During 2015, this viral lineage has also spread into Southeast Asia (Laos PDR), and work is now underway to see whether this lineage will spread more widely in Asia and replace the established serotype O lineages, as it has already done in India. - Mod.AS
