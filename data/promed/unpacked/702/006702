The FDA is working closely with the CDC and Tennessee Board of Pharmacy to investigate reports of 7 adverse events associated with steroid injections compounded by Main Street Family Pharmacy, LLC (Main Street) of Newbern, TN.

Out of an abundance of caution, the FDA recommends that health care providers not administer any products labeled as sterile from Main Street and quarantine them until further guidance is provided.

The reports of adverse events are all from patients who received preservative-free methylprednisolone acetate (80 mg/mL) by injection. To date, the FDA has received 7 reports. Clinical information about these patients is pending; at least 1 of these adverse events appears to involve fungus.

An investigation into the exact source of these adverse events is still ongoing, but these cases are associated with a potentially contaminated medication. As part of the ongoing investigation, the FDA will continue to work closely with the CDC and state authorities to thoroughly review the sterile practices at Main Street.

The FDA asks health care providers and consumers to report adverse events or quality problems experienced with the use of any Main Street products to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program.

At least 7 people have reported complications after being injected with a potentially contaminated medication made in a pharmacy in Tennessee, federal and state health officials said. The FDA said that it had not yet determined the nature of the illnesses, but that at least 1 person seemed to have a fungal infection. Last fall, fungal contamination of the same type of medication, an injectable steroid produced by a compounding pharmacy in Massachusetts, caused the deaths of more than 50 people. Officials in North Carolina, where 2 of the new cases were found, said that the symptoms were skin abscesses and that there had been no reports of meningitis, stroke or other life-threatening conditions. Illinois said it was investigating 5 cases of patients who developed abscesses after receiving the medication, which is used to treat back pain and swelling in joints, among other conditions.

[The size of this new outbreak of seemingly fungal infections caused by contamination of a compounding pharmacy-produced corticosteroid for injection is too early to know. The previous huge outbreak also began with just a handful of cases reported. ProMED awaits more information regarding the amount of vials distributed to which states and which fungus was isolated.

It is time to allow FDA to be able to oversee this industry by providing not only the proper legislation but also the money and manpower to do the job correctly. Below is a partial list of reported clusters of infections linked to supposedly sterile products produced by compounding pharmacies, almost all in the USA:
