[Following the first 2 foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks reported from Israel on 5 Jan 2021 addressing 2 commercial animal operations (housed dairy cattle and dairy goats) in the western Galilee, 6 additional outbreaks (beef cattle in pasture and fattening calves) have been reported, similarly along the Lebanese border, of which 6 in cattle (beef cattle in pasture and fattening calves) and one (reported above) involving a fallow deer (found dead). OIE's current summary of the (continuing) event is the following:
Total outbreaks = 9 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 2706 / 274 / 12 / 0 / 0
Goats / 1491 / 170 / 100 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 386 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Fallow deer / Not available / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

The causative agent is, most probably, circulating in southern Lebanon. Wild boars are abundant on both sides of the international fencing structure and may have served as an intermediate transmitter (pigs are notoriously known as prolific emitters of airborne FMD virus).

An interactive OIE map, presenting all 9 foci and links to all reports, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=37437 (click on the cluster, zoom in).

Had Ness, where the virus was found to have 3 nucleotides being different from the other isolates, is situated in southwest Golan, about 20 km (12.4 mi) from the Syrian and Jordanian borders (map at https://tinyurl.com/y3fqdjl3).

The applied vaccine was expected to match the current virus strain; this issue is under study. - Mod.AS
