The James S. Porterfield Prize in International Virology 2014 is to be awarded by open competition to up to 2 students of virology registered for a degree at any University worldwide. The closing date for applications is 20 Jan 2014. The prize is GBP 600 [USD 985].

The prize can contribute towards the costs of travel, subsistence, fees, and expenses of the student in connection with a piece of research to be conducted by the student at an institution and in a country other than their own.

Prizewinners will be required to submit a report of their work to the panel by 31 Dec 2014.

The criteria for award will be the academic promise of the student and the likely value of the research to science or medicine and the student's scientific education. Eligible projects will be those in virology that require international travel, and preference will be given for field or laboratory work on arboviruses.

Applications using the form available at http://www.wsjlab.com/international-virology-prize/ must be sent to <william.james@bnc.ox.ac.uk> to arrive before 1700h GMT 20 Jan 2014.
