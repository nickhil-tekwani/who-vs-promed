A 17 Aug 2022 letter in Lancet Respiratory Medicine titled "Tomato Flu Outbreak in India" speculated on causes of an outbreak of febrile rash with red lesions in approximately 108 young children in India (Kerala then Tamil Nadu and Odisha) since May 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00300-9).

Of note, the 3 authors stated the following in the letter's opening paragraph:

"...a new virus known as tomato flu, or tomato fever, has emerged in India in the state of Kerala in children younger than 5 years. The rare viral infection is in an endemic state and is considered non-life-threatening...."

The authors did not present data for "a new virus" nor what they meant by "the rare viral infection is in an endemic state," if indeed it was a new virus.

On 19 Aug 2022, viral sequencing by the UK Health Security Agency in Colindale, London, demonstrated Coxsackie A16 from skin lesions in 2 children returning from Kerala to the UK in May 2022, as reported in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal by Tang et al in an article titled "Kerala Tomato Flu -- A Manifestation of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease" (https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/9900/Kerala_Tomato_Flu___A_Manifestation_of_Hand_Foot.160.aspx).

They reported that "Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 'Kerala tomato flu' partial CA16 sequences shared a most common recent ancestor with a clade from China (2011-2014) (Figure S1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/INF/E793)."

My review of this one-page supplement found this statement: "A single sequence from France (2006, purple) is shown as part of the China clade."

While keeping an open mind to new data that may appear later, at this point there is no evidence of a new virus or disease. The term "tomato flu" is a misnomer that should no longer be used because both hand, foot and mouth disease and its enteroviral causes, such as Coxsackie A16, are well known.

["Tomato flu gained its name on the basis of the eruption of red and painful blisters throughout the body that gradually enlarge to the size of a tomato.... As with other viral infections, further symptoms include fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fever, dehydration, swelling of joints, body aches, and common influenza-like symptoms, which are similar to those manifested in dengue" (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(22)00300-9/fulltext).

The authors state in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal that "The unusual presentation of the rash in the infant initially made us consider CA6 as the most likely cause, though monkeypox was also a differential, considering the current global outbreaks" (https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/9900/Kerala_Tomato_Flu___A_Manifestation_of_Hand_Foot.160.aspx). The virus is infectious like hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children ages 1-5. Virus rash differentials need to include the different etiologies of HFMD, monkeypox, chikungunya, and dengue, among other possible agents. But there is no good evidence "tomato flu" is caused by a novel agent. - Mod.LK

[2] Colombia (Tolima): suspected

The 1st cases began to be known a month ago [late July 2022] in the rural area of the municipality. The common point is that only children between the ages of 1 and 8 got sick. Given the confusion registered, the local authorities specified that it is not the foot-and-mouth disease that it gives to the animals.

In Villahermosa, an alert was generated due to an outbreak among young children of the pathology known as [hand, foot and mouth disease], which is characterized by a pronounced rash in these 3 parts of the body. In dialogue with Sandra Rivera, Secretary of Health of the Municipality, she explained that the virus that circulates is not, nor is it related to foot-and-mouth disease that is known in animals.

Among these actions taken to counteract the disease, it was decided to close the 2 Child Development Centers, CDI, that the municipality has, due to the appearance of an outbreak. It is expected to reopen its doors this Monday [29 Aug 2022].

The disease began to be registered about a month ago in rural areas. In one of the villages, 7 children had the symptoms, "a lady sent me photos, then the doctor explained that there is a virus called [hand, foot and mouth disease].

"Then they brought us 5 children in the CDI and there we took the measures, but in the CDI it was enough to give the outbreak to 15 minors", explained the Secretary of Health.

Regarding the state of the children who are not older than 8 years, he indicated that they have been followed up and the report is that they recover satisfactorily, "most of the children had a fever, but it did not escalate...," added the head of the Health portfolio.

In this topic the question arises if the appearance of the disease is related to an incomplete vaccination schedule, on which the Coordinator of Public Health explained that there is no scientific evidence. "It is a condition that usually occurs commonly in children, but suddenly it began to emerge in the municipality and we still do not have an epidemiological link established that tells us what was the reason why the minors began to get infected."

The disease apparently would not be exclusive to Villahermosa, since apparently cases have also been registered in Lebanon, among other populations in the region.

The officials indicated that being a condition similar to chickenpox, the form of contagion can be respiratory or oral, also, having contact with the rash that is generated on the skin. Given the risk, the municipal administration is carrying out prevention campaigns and providing information in educational institutions.

"The main symptom is fever, the child begins to suffer loss of appetite, irritability, sore throat and finally the rash appears around the mouth, palate, tongue, hands, feet; it can also occur around the genital area," described the Health Coordinator.

He added that although patients are treated in case, the recommendation is to make the respective consultation in the municipal hospital and avoid resorting to home remedies at all costs. In this disease, you should be aware of the fever and control it properly.

Recommendations:
- Isolation for 10 days
- Prevent children from sharing objects with other minors or members of the house
- Keep your kitchen utensils (plates, glasses and spoons) separate
- The laundry must be done separately from the garments of the members of the household
