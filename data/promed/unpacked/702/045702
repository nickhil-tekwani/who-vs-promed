Democratic Republic of Congo: outbreaks of measles and rabies
-------------------------------------------------------------
More than 14 people have died in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) as
outbreaks of measles and rabies ravage Orientale province in the north east
of this vast country, officials said.
A measles epidemic in the town of Basoko in north eastern Orientale
Province has infected 828 people, claiming 9 lives, while in Isiro, in the
same province, some 30 people have contracted rabies, and 5 of them have
died [interesting statistic for a disease said to be universally fatal. -
Mod.SH].
The DRC government is planning to send emergency health teams to the 2
provinces and has called for UN health agencies to provide "urgent help to
bring these epidemics under control... and help locals."
In 2003, the Democratic Republic of Congo emerged from a 5 year war that
claimed some 2.5 million lives either directly in combat or through disease
and hunger.

[The number of suspected cases of rabies seems high in relation to the
number of rabies deaths recorded (and also to the relatively small number
of cases in the measles outbreak). Further information would be appreciated
concerning the circumstances of the rabies outbreak and the animal species
(domestic or wild) responsible for transmission of the disease to humans. -
