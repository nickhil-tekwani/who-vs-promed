According to South African acting health minister Jeff Radebe, a
total of 314 cases of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis (XDR
TB) have been confirmed countrywide, with 214 deaths.
The majority of cases occurred in KwaZulu-Natal (228), with 201
deaths. Treatment is being given to 27 people. Radebe said 203 of the
cases were in Masinga, with most deaths occurring there.
"This is an area of concern as it is not yet clear why this area is
most affected and the reasons for such high deaths. We will be
working with the province to conduct an epidemiological assessment of
the XDR TB epidemic in the area," Radebe said.
The Eastern Cape had 33 cases, with 5 fatalities, and 27 people on
treatment. One patient was transferred. Gauteng had 13 cases, with 2
fatalities, while the North West had 10 cases with 4 deaths, Radebe
said. The Free State had 8 cases, with 2 deaths, 5 people were on
treatment and one patient had defaulted. The Northern Cape and
Western Cape also had 8 cases each, with no fatalities. Limpopo had 5
cases, with one death, 3 people on treatment and 1 defaulting.
Mpumlanga had one case of XDR TB and the person was also on treatment.
Radebe said his department had ensured that all multidrug-resistant
TB patients currently on treatment were tested for 2nd-line
susceptibility to ensure early detection of XDR TB. "Close contacts
of all confirmed XDR TB patients have been screened and tested for TB."
To cope with the demand the National Health Laboratory Services
increased staffing in the laboratories that conduct 2nd-line drug
susceptibility testing. Radebe said that the department, together
with the Medical Research Council and a Geneva-based foundation,
would embark "on a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility,
impact, and cost effectiveness of 2 rapid methods to diagnose resistant TB".
The test would enable results within 2 days for 1st-line
susceptibility and 2nd-line drug testing would be done sooner,
reducing the turn-around time of 10 to 12 weeks for confirmation of
2nd-line drug susceptibility, he said.

[The data below shows the different case fatality rate (CFR) in
different provinces. The number of total cases adds up but the deaths
add up to 215, one more than the total deaths reported in the posting.
Province / Total cases / Total deaths / CFR (percent)
KwaZulu-Natal / 228 / 201 / 88
Eastern Cape / 33 / 5 / 15
Gauteng / 13 / 2 / 15
North West / 10 / 4 / 40
Free State / 8 / 2 / 25
Northern Cape /8 / 0 / 0
Western Cape / 8 / 0 / 0
Limpopo / 5 / 1 / 20
Mpumlanga / 1 / 0 / 0
Total / 314 / 215 / 68
The dramatic difference in CFR in KwaZulu-Natal to some extent may
represent the natural history of XDR TB in HIV-infected individuals
without treatment, as many of the initial cases died even before the
organism grew in culture. A decreased CFR may represent more rapid
culture methods (such as liquid media), earlier empiric institution
of 2nd-line agents, or the infection occurring in
non-immunocompromised hosts. - Mod.LL
