Faced with a shortage of polio vaccine, the World Health Organization urged countries [Fri 28 Apr 2017] to resort to smaller, fractional doses to ward off outbreaks of the crippling disease. "We do have a problem with the vaccine in the sense of not having enough of it," Alejandro Cravioto, head of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE), told reporters in a telephone conference.

"But the recent evidence that we reviewed shows that even if we give a smaller dose of vaccine under the skin instead of inside the muscle, we can have the same impact of protection as before," he said. SAGE, which advises the UN health agency on immunization policies, called for 2 smaller doses of the vaccine to be injected under the skin at 6 and 14 weeks after birth, instead of a single, larger [intramuscular] dose.

This makes it possible to "reduce the volume" of vaccine administered, WHO senior health advisor Philippe Duclos told AFP [Agence France-Presse]. French group Sanofi and Serum Institute of India make the main vaccine used to combat polio, the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). But there have been "problems" in the production, Duclos said, adding that the stocks of the vaccine should be fully replenished by the end of 2018.

Cases of polio have decreased by 99 percent since 1988, when polio was endemic in 125 countries and 350 000 cases were recorded worldwide. The wild version of the virus now exists only in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where 8 cases have been registered over the past 6 months.

There are still rare cases of vaccine-derived polio infections, caused by another type of polio vaccine, which contains small amounts of weakened but live polio virus. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) replicates in the gut and can be passed to others through faecal-contaminated water -- meaning it won't hurt the child who has been vaccinated, but could infect their neighbours. [This is not completely correct as VAPP -- vaccine associated paralytic poliomyelitis -- albeit rare, can occur in the recipient of the vaccine (see discussion below). - Mod.MPP]

Long-term, WHO recommends that the OPV should be phased out worldwide and replaced completely by IPV.

The WHO experts on [Fri 28 Apr 2017] hailed progress towards eliminating wild polio transmission. But they warned that even after the disease has been eradicated it will be necessary to continue mass-immunization with the IPV vaccine to avoid a resurgence of the virus.

[I should start this comment with the fact that in the past month since the last poliomyelitis update, there have been 0 newly confirmed cases of wild poliovirus (WPV) associated paralytic disease and 0 newly confirmed circulating vaccine derived poliovirus associated (cVDPV) paralytic disease reported in the world. Hence, there have been a total of 5 WPV associated cases and 0 cVDPV cases reported with dates of onset since 1 Jan 2017. That being said, in the past week there have been 2 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental positive samples from Nangarhar and Kandahar in March 2017 reported by Afghanistan and, 4 new WPV1 environmental positive samples from Balochistan (Pakistan, 2 from Killa Abdullah and one from Quetta), and one from Sindh (Gadap, greater Karachi), taken in March and beginning of April 2017, reported from Pakistan, confirming that the WPV1 is still circulating "silently" in both countries (see http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/).

The rationale for switching from the oral polio vaccine (OPV) to the inactivated (injectable) polio vaccine (IPV) was the observation that with the decline of WPV associated paralytic disease, paralytic disease related to the attenuated oral polio vaccine virus has become more significant, especially through infections with reverted neurovirulence vaccine viruses -- the cVDPV. Circulation of the wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) was interrupted in 1999, but the cVDPV2 is now responsible for approximately 86 percent of all cVDPV cases reported globally since 2000 (697 cVDPV2 cases out of a total of 812 cVDPV reported since 2000 (http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/WPV_2012-2017_25AVR17.pdf).

With respect to the vaccine associated paralytic polio (VAPP), the rates found in the literature are variable depending upon the specific methodology used in determining the rates. In general the rate seen following the 1st dose of OPV is much higher than those seen following additional doses and ranges from 1 case per 700 000 doses administered to 1 case per 3.4 million 1st doses administered -- a wide range of observations. A 1969 WHO collaborative study showed a rate of 1 per 5.9 million doses administered to vaccine recipients and 1 per 6.7 million doses administered for contacts (see refs 1-6 below and http://www.who.int/vaccine_safety/initiative/tools/polio_vaccine_rates_information_sheet.pdf).

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), in collaboration with national health authorities and experts developed the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018. Critical in this plan was the elimination of the OPV type 2 virus from the OPV, creating a bivalent OPV (bOPV) so as to eliminate a potential source of additional cVDPV2. To continue protection of the population against cVDPV2, all countries currently using tOPV (trivalent OPV) were to introduce at least one dose of IPV as part of the immunization schedule during 2016 to be administered at 14 weeks of age or the nearest immunization visit after the age of 14 weeks.

To address potential vaccination shortages due to the major increase in demand for IPV, studies were undertaken to address the use of fractional doses. The routine recommendation for IPV is for a 0.5 ml dose of vaccine to be administered intramuscularly. Fractional doses (1/5 of a dose, or 0.1 ml) administered intradermally were demonstrated to be equally effective in producing adequate serologic responses if given as a 2 dose schedule to be given at 6 and 14 weeks (see refs. 7-12 below). The studies demonstrated that while a single fractional dose does not produce an adequate response compared with a single full dose intramuscularly, 2 fractional doses administered intradermally produce a superior response than the single full dose administered intramuscularly.

It is interesting that a similar vaccination change was applied for the yellow fever epidemics ongoing 2016-2017 -- when faced with a shortage of vaccines for an adequate outbreak response, the recommendation was to switch to a fractional dose -- a strategy which interrupted the ongoing yellow fever epidemic in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
