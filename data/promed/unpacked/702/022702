In cattle cemetery built sports complex
---------------------------------------
Specialists VyatGU in Russia have proved that the
territory of the former anthrax cattle cemetery poses no danger to residents.

The green area of 1500 square meters [1794 square
yards] on the streets of Moscow, opposite the
House of press "Vyatka," was ownerless for 80
years. The reason: Formerly it had been a burial
site for diseased animals. Two years ago, experts
at the Vyatka State University decided to
investigate what dangers this land presented.

The scientists took 180 soil samples, which were
then sent to the Saratov Institute "Microbe."
Anthrax spores were not detected and so the chief
sanitary doctor Gennady Onishchenko decided to
reduce the sanitary protection zone about the
cattle cemetery from 1500 to 50 sq. meters [60
square yards]. The scientists have proposed to
preserve the 50 sq. meters, and the remaining
1450 sq. meters to be used for the construction
of socially significant University structures.
The university needs a brand new "Polytechnical" sports complex.

Construction on the remaining cattle cemetery
site includes fencing and monitoring conditions.
The action plan includes, inter alia, the
creation of embankments and asphalt. All this is
intended to strengthen the security guarantees
for the facility, said Julia Ageyeva, the spokesperson for VyatGU.

Work on former cattle cemetery site will begin
immediately after the signing of the tripartite
plan between the Vyatka State University,
Rosselkhoznadzor and Rospotrebnadzor. The draft
for area development is being prepared.

reports about this historic cattle grave, but
little of any meaning. It is fortunate that it
appears to be safe for development. - Mod.MHJ]
