Background information on Verotoxin-producing _E. coli_ in Scotland
--------------------------------------------------------------------
505 isolates of VTEC were recovered during 1987 to 1991.
202 cases were reported in 1991; 115 in 1992; 119 in 1993; 242 in
1994; 247 in 1995; 506 in 1996; 423 in 1997; 217 in 1998; 294 in
1999; 197 in 2000.
235 cases were reported in 2001; 229 in 2002.
Rates for VTEC infection were 3.4/100 000 in 1990; 4.0/100 000 in
1991; 2.3/100 000 in 1992; 2.4/100 000 in 1993.
One outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infection was reported in 1996; 5 in
1997; 2 in 1998.
An outbreak in 1996 was traced to meat from a local butcher. 512
confirmed cases (151 hospitalized; 34 HUS or TTP; 22 fatal) were
reported, 75 percent of these from Lanarkshire. During this period,
87 suspected or confirmed cases were also registered in Forth Valley,
Greater Glasgow, and Lothian.
A nosocomial outbreak at Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary
involved 37 cases of _E. coli_ O157 phage type 8 during May to June
1997. An outbreak of 8 cases at a primary school in Aberdeenshire in
1999 was ascribed to unpasteurized goat cheese. Another school
outbreak traced to goat cheese was reported in the Grampian region -
30 cases, including 1 with HUS.
An outbreak of 6 cases in Wester Ross (western coast) in 1999 was
traced to contaminated water.
