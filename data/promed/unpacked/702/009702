YERSINIA PESTIS, ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE - MADAGASCAR

A strain of plague-causing bacteria [_Yersinia pestis_] resistant to the
antibiotics normally used to treat the disease has emerged in Madagascar.
Although the researchers who isolated it say they know of no other
occurrences of the resistant bacteria, they note that the genes that confer
drug resistance can easily spread to other plague strains, posing a threat of
new pandemics of the disease.
Transmitted mainly by flea bites, bubonic plague last flared up as a pandemic
more than 100 years ago in Hong Kong before spreading around the world.
Today, although the disease is still fatal when not treated in time,
antibiotics have reduced the mortality rate in plague patients to about 10%.
But in [today's] New England Journal of Medicine, a team of researchers from
the Pasteur Institutes in Paris and in Antananarivo, Madagascar, report
having isolated a drug-resistant strain of _Yersinia pestis_, the bacterium
that causes plague, from a patient in Madagascar. The patient did not
respond to the classical therapy for the disease, a cocktail of the
antibiotics chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline. _Y. pestis_
isolated from the patient also failed to respond to another antibiotic mix,
containing sulfonamides and tetracycline, that is often given to people who
may have been exposed to plague. The patient [a 16 year-old] survived,
however, thanks to yet another antibiotic, trimethoprim, to which the plague
strain was not resistant. [Case occurred in 1995]
The organism isolated from the boy appears to have acquired a set of five
antibiotic resistance genes, all at once. Just how the bacterium manages to
outwit [?] the drugs is not yet clear. But the researchers report isolating
from the new strain a small, circular strand of DNA, known as a plasmid.
Similar plasmids carry the genes for antibiotic resistance in other resistant
bacteria, such as enterobacteria and _E. coli_. The team showed that in the
test tube the plasmid could be transferred from the resistant _Y. pestis_ to
both a laboratory strain of the same bacterium and to _E. coli_. "This
transfer [of plasmids] takes place at a high frequency," says team member
Elisabeth Carniel of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, suggesting that such
antibiotic resistance could easily spread.
David Dennis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Fort
Collins, Colorado, warns that this finding may have international
implications: "It is an isolated case, but it sounds a warning that we need
to be alert to the possibility that it could spread to other strains," he
says. "If it does, that would be a considerable public-health concern."

If the transfer of the plasmid took place in the ill boy, the event is
relatively unimportant, for the strain was killed off by antibiotics when he
recovered. However, if the exchange occurred in a rodent, the situation is
more worrisome because it suggests drug-resistant bacteria may be circulating
in the organism's natural environment. One immediate response to today's
report will be a search for drug-resistant organisms in rodents in
Madagascar, and elsewhere.
