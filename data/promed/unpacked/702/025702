A suspected case of the equine bacterial disease strangles in a
thoroughbred at Hoosier Park prompted track officials to quarantine a
barn on Saturday [12 Sep 2009].

All 59 horses stabled in the barn with the horse suspected of having
contracted _Streptococcus equi_, the causative agent of strangles,
have been quarantined until test results are returned from the lab.
Officials at the Anderson, Indiana track are keeping in constant
contact with state and track veterinarians monitoring the horse.
Thorough test results are expected to take up to 72 hours. If test
results return a positive identification of strangles, then all
horses located in the quarantined barn will be required to undergo
mandatory testing for the disease.

Signs of strangles are fever, nasal discharge, cough, loss of
appetite, and difficulty swallowing. Also known as equine distemper,
the disease also can result in enlarged lymph nodes, can impair
breathing, and may even result in death through asphyxiation. The
disease is highly communicable for up to 4 weeks with the capability
of contaminating the surroundings for another month after exposure to
a contagious animal has ceased. Young horses are most susceptible,
but strangles may occur in animals of any age.

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of _Equidae_
characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses,
donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive, capsulated-hemolytic
Lancefield group C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a
primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious, and produces high morbidity and
low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via
fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals
are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and
initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease.
Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on
temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme
heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid
secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the
organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn
facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated
for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of
infection is fever (103-106 F [39.4-41.1 C]). Within 24-48 hours of
the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of
strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge,
depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with
retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty
swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal
pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with
residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the
disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever.
Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by
abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the
abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed
with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days
until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]
can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve
appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression but ultimately
prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia,
prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss of
appetite]. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of
infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort
abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment
is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses
highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If
antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000
IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and
brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread
the disease to other horses. Those affiliated with the Indiana Board
of Animal Health, the office of the state veterinarian, are quite
conscious of biosecurity and are able to assist the track
veterinarian and the owners with proper methods to avoid spreading the disease.
