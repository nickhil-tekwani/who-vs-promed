1st Report of Melting Decay of 'Red Globe' Grapes in California.
D. P. Morgan and T. J. Michailides, Department of Plant Pathology,
University of California, Davis/Kearney Agricultural Center, 9240 South
Riverbend Ave., Parlier 93648. Plant Dis. 88:1047, 2004; published on-line
as D-2004-0624-02N, 2004. Accepted for publication 21 Jun 2004.
Since the late 1990s, a melting decay of 'Red Globe' grapes has
occasionally been observed in cold storage facilities in California.
Symptoms of the decay included a cracking and dissolution of the epidermis
followed by the development of sunken decayed areas. In extreme cases,
nearly the entire berry liquefied. The affected berries usually were
randomly distributed over the cluster but sometimes berry-to-berry spread
seemed to have occurred. The disease has not been observed in the field.
Initial symptoms are usually observed after 2 weeks of cold storage (-0.5
to 0 deg C and 90 to 95 percent relative humidity).
In 2003, melting decay developed in 'Red Globe' grapes in many cold storage
facilities in California and in grapes stored for export. Microscopic
examination under the skin at the edges of the decayed lesions revealed
numerous yeast and bacterial cells. _Bacillus subtilis_ (Ehrenberg) Cohn,
_Cryptococcus laurentii_ (Kufferath) Skinner, and _Aureobasidium pullulans_
(de Bary) Arnaud were consistently isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA)
from samples submitted from 2 cold storage facilities. Certified diagnostic
laboratories identified the bacterium and 2 yeasts.
To fulfill Koch's postulates, we performed the following experiments. 'Red
Globe' grape berries with the pedicel attached were surface-disinfested in
a solution of 0.084 percent sodium hypochlorite, 1.5 percent ethanol, and
0.005 percent Tween 20 for 4 min, and washed with sterile deionized water.
Grape berries were placed on raised plastic screens in a humid chamber.
After the surface of the berries dried, 0.25 ml of a cell suspension (10
million cells per ml) of each microorganism was placed on the surface of
each berry without wounding.
Water (150 to 200 ml) was added to the bottom of the container to
create >98 percent relative humidity (measured with a datalogger), and the
containers were incubated at 20 deg C for 7 days or 0.5 deg C for 6 weeks.
With fruit stored at 20 deg C, the epidermis of all the berries cracked
between 24 and 48 h after inoculation.
Severe symptoms of melting decay developed 1 week later. With berries
incubated at 0.5 deg C, melting decay symptoms developed after 6 weeks.
Symptoms were most severe on berries inoculated with _C. laurentii_.
However, when inoculated berries were preincubated at 20 deg C for 14 h
prior to storage at 0.5 deg C, symptoms developed after 3 weeks. In this
case, and when berries were incubated at 20 deg C, symptom expression was
similar among the 3 pathogens. A number (>80 percent) of the affected
berries disintegrated and liquefied in a pattern similar to that observed
in berries from commercial cold storage facilities.
The pathogen used to inoculate the grapes was consistently isolated in pure
culture from subsequent lesions. Therefore, a postharvest disease in 'Red
Globe' grapes called melting decay can be caused by the bacterium, _B.
subtilis_, or 2 different yeast species.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _B. subtilis_ or C. laurentii_
as pathogens of grape berries in the United States and worldwide. _A.
pullulans_ has been isolated from _Vitis vinifera_ (1,2), but is reported
for the 1st time as one of the causal agents of melting decay of 'Red
Globe' grapes. All three organisms also caused symptoms on 'Crimson
Seedless' grapes, but melting decay has not been reported as a problem in
this cultivar.

[The fact that the incidence of _Bacillus subtilis_ [Bs] in cold storage
has increased dramatically from the 1990s to 2003, suggests that perhaps a
new strain of Bs has evolved under those conditions. There is a report in
1992 of Bs being associated with soybean seed, but that requires confirmation.
Infection of grapes by the 2 yeast species is of interest and may be
related to environmental conditions in the field as well as in cold
storage. Bs is widely used as a fungicide on flowers and vegetables,
including crop plants.
The reference for Bs infection of grapes is as follows:
