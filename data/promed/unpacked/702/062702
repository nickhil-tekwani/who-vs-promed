There is a confirmed outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Lyantonde district. The disease has already claimed 11 people and left several others in critical condition in 2 months, according to local authorities.

Dr. Moses Nkanika, the Lyantonde District Health Officer-DHO, says there is a possibility that the victims consumed meat from infected cows, sheep and goats. He says 2 other patients died after being referred to Mabarara Regional Hospital. Nine of the deaths have been reported in Kitazigolokwa village, Katovu parish in Lyantonde rural sub-county.

Nkanika said that they have received several cases from different sub-counties, and the most complicated are referred to Mbarara Regional hospital. He noted that they are on high alert to the spread of the disease.

Dr. Okoth Obo, the Medical Superintendent of Lyantonde Hospital, said they established an isolation center to handle RVF cases, adding that they have received 10 patients in recent weeks.

Patrick Rwozi, the Katovu Parish councilor, says some of the victims died after 2 or 3 days in admission. In Kansagama sub-county, more than 10 people in Mityekula village, Kagaala parish have been admitted in critical condition after consuming meat from an infected cow. Bebwa Abern, the Mityekula village secretary, says one of the residents slaughtered a sick cow and sold meat to fellow residents.

RVF is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but has the capacity to infect humans and can result in death, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Ronald Bameka, the Lyantonde District Veterinary Officer, says over 15 cows and 22 goats have died since the outbreak. He says that over 200 animals are at high risk, which may lead to a huge loss to livestock dealers in Lyantonde.

He warns that meat from infected animals is being sneaked into the market posing a high risk to the consumers, adding that they have so far arrested 3 people for slaughtering sick cows and selling meat to unsuspecting residents.

According to Bameka, he wrote to the ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries and the ministry of health seeking their intervention, but neither has responded.

In order to contain the spread of the fever, Fred Muhangi, the Lyantonde LCV Chairperson, says the district has already paid for radio programs to sensitize the public about the outbreak.

He says that they have also stepped up their operations against the sale of uninspected meat as well as unauthorized animal movement in the district. The RVF outbreak comes at a time when the district is still under a foot-and-mouth-disease quarantine, which has hindered the livestock business.

The Health Ministry Permanent Secretary, Dr. Diana Atwine, says different teams of experts have already been dispatched to Lyantonde, Mbarara, Isingiro and Kiruhura where the outbreak was announced.

The teams will educated people about the outbreak and the danger of eating meat from infected cows.

[Previous reports from Uganda placed the blame for occurrence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) on incoming refugees. No evidence has been reported to substantiate that claim.

RVF virus is endemic in eastern Africa, and sporadic cases occur there in livestock and humans. This year (2018), large areas of Uganda and eastern Africa have undergone heavy rains and flooding, providing extensive breeding sites for RVF virus vector mosquitoes.

The loss of human and livestock life is indeed unfortunate. Fortunately, the district is sponsoring radio programs and field teams to issue precautionary warnings to the public for handling or slaughtering ill animals to prevent RVF virus transmission and are arresting individuals who have sold meat from ill animals. Personal protective equipment should be used by healthcare providers.

Though the current RVF event in Uganda started in June 2018, having first been recognized in human cases, information on cases in animals were published initially in early August 2018 (see 20180802.5943566). Results of tests are expected. No report to the OIE has been submitted so far. - Mod.AS]
