A tropical fungus that has taken hold in temperate British Columbia
is more infectious and deadly on Vancouver Island than anywhere else
on Earth.
The fungus, called _Cryptococcus gattii_, has infected 101 people who
live on, or who have visited, eastern Vancouver Island. It has killed
at least 4 people, as well as a horse, 11 porpoises that washed
ashore, and dozens of cats and dogs. It is 37 times more infectious
on the island than it is in Australia, where it has long been a
fixture in the environment, an international research team reported
yesterday [23 Nov 2004] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences.
Symptoms of infection include cough, lethargy, and night sweats. In
serious cases, the fungus moves from the lungs into the central
nervous system.
The unprecedented BC outbreak, which began in 1999 and continues
today, highlights the need for global monitoring of the fungus, say
the scientists, who suspect it may be expanding its range because of
climate change. The outbreak was initially linked to Rathtrevor Beach
Provincial Park in Parksville, but _Cryptococcus_ has now been found
in soil and on trees from Victoria north to Courtenay.
The scientists warn the fungus now has the potential to cause
infections in temperate regions around the world. "From a scientific
point of view, it is extraordinary," says Karen Bartlett, a co-author
of the report, who studies environment health at the University of BC
"It is so rare to be right on top of an emerging infectious disease."
The fungi can be deadly when drawn deep into the lungs. The cells
have a "slippery" sugar coating that enables them to evade the lungs'
protective cells, which normally engulf and kill infectious
organisms, says Ms. Bartlett. Being a tropical fungus, _Cryptococcus_
also has the ability to thrive at the body's temperature of 37 C that
kills most other fungi.
How and why the tropical fungus took hold on the island is still a
mystery, but researchers believe it is there to stay. "I don't think
it's going to go away anytime soon," says Sarah Kidd, lead author of
the paper, who is now at the University of BC. She has moved from
Australia to BC to study the outbreak of the fungus, which is living
in the soil and under tree bark. It can also survive in seawater,
which could help explain the porpoise deaths.
Ms. Bartlett suspects _Cryptococcus gattii_ may have been on
Vancouver Island at low levels for a long period, but no one noticed,
because it was incapable of becoming airborne and infecting people or
animals. She says something changed in the late 1990s. The leading
theory is that the eastern coast of Vancouver Island has become
warmer and drier, making the region more hospitable. Or, perhaps, the
researchers say, logging and urban development opened up a new niche
for the fungus. It may have been imported on a plant from the tropics.
While _Cryptococcus_ has proven more infectious on Vancouver Island,
the researchers stress that it isn't as lethal, or as fast-spreading,
as many other pathogens. "The attack rate is still quite low," says
Ms. Bartlett. Vancouver Island has 37 infections a year for every one
million people, compared to about one case a year for every one
million people in Australia. There is less risk of infection in the
winter months, perhaps because BC's rains wash the _Cryptococcus_
particles out of the air.
Older men are most vulnerable to infection, perhaps because they tend
to spend a lot of time outdoors, says Laura MacDougall, an
epidemiologist at the BC Centre for Disease Control. Antifungal
medications are available, but must be taken for several months, she
says, adding that most infections are now [identified] early, and
successfully treated, because physicians and veterinarians have
_Cryptococcus_ on their "index of suspicion."
The researchers say the infection rate may drop, as islanders develop
immunity to the fungus over time.

[This particular basidiomycete yeast-like fungus produces primarily
respiratory and neurological disease. Hosts that are NOT immuno-compromised
appear to be at higher risk. Those individuals developing the neurological
disease are at greater risk of dying. Masses of this agent are usually found
in the lungs and brain. There is some similarity to the yeast _C.
neoformans_, with which immuno-compromised people are affected. - Mod.TG]
