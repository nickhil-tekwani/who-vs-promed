[_Gyrodactylus salaris_ (Platyhelminthes; Monogenea) is a viviparous freshwater parasite that may cause infection in Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_). It is an obligate parasite with a direct life cycle. Parasites give birth to live offspring, and there are no eggs, resting stages, specialized transmission stages or intermediate hosts. _Gyrodactylus salaris_ is an ectoparasite mainly on Atlantic salmon, but can survive and reproduce on several salmonids, such as rainbow trout (_Oncorhynchus mykiss_), Arctic charr (_Salvelinus alpinus_), North American brook trout (_Salvelinus fontinalis_), grayling (_Thymallus thymallus_), North American lake trout (_Salvelinus namaycush_) and brown trout (_Salmo trutta_) (in declining order of susceptibility).
This parasite occurs on the fins of most infected Atlantic salmon, but site preference is dependent on intensity of infection. Parasites are also commonly found on the body and less commonly on the gills. On other hosts, the distribution may be different, but on some host species the parasite is relatively less abundant on the fins and relatively more common on the body compared with salmon.
Its distribution is restricted to Europe. It has been recovered from farmed Atlantic salmon or farmed rainbow trout in several (mainly northern) European countries. In the wild, the parasite has been found on wild salmonids, mainly Atlantic salmon parr, in rivers in Russia, Sweden and Norway. In 2006, _G. salaris_ was reported from fish farms in Italy and, in 2007, from fish farms in Poland and Macedonia, and in 2009, from fish farms in Romania. Great Britain and Ireland have been demonstrated to be free of the parasite.
Mortality can be 100 percent in susceptible farmed Atlantic salmon if not treated. Mortality in Norwegian rivers can be as high as 98 percent, with an average of about 85 percent. Mortality in other susceptible host species is usually low or not observed.
