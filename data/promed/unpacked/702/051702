In the last week alone (29 May through 6 Jun 2022), at least 21 scrub typhus cases (on average 3 cases/day) have been detected at the laboratory of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) (Kathmandu, Nepal). Samples were sent from different hospitals in the capital (Kathmandu), [from those] who presented with fever or symptoms [that] look similar to scrub typhus. We use a rapid diagnostic test kit for the identification of scrub typhus, and antibiotic doxycycline as the drug of choice (usually after laboratory confirmation) for the treatment of the illness.

Scrub typhus is often seen (at STIDH) between July and October, with a peak in September, meaning scrub typhus probably [has] started spreading in Nepal, and thus, cases are expected to increase in the coming days or weeks.

[The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake, with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to infected chiggers (larval mites), but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and a necrotic skin lesion at the site of mite inoculation (the eschar). Other than the eschar, scrub typhus has no distinctive clinical features to make an accurate clinical diagnosis and the presence of an eschar in patients has been reported to vary widely.

Confirmation of the diagnosis requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region, like Nepal.

The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions and have reported variable sensitivity (https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/JCM.02181-16 and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20129967/). Having an accurate, available, and affordable point-of-care diagnostic test for scrub typhus would be important to avoid unnecessary or inappropriate antibiotic therapy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5892940/#abstract-2title). Rapid point-of-care immunoassays for the detection of IgM antibodies to _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ have been reviewed (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13205-020-02389-w, https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ac10/bd6a10a0c9b97732925ecffe248581a7935e.pdf, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2911186).

Doxycycline is the drug of choice and it is preferred over other tetracyclines for treatment of scrub typhus; it is rarely associated with staining of teeth in children younger than 8 years (1). Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are also reported to be efficacious (2). Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, have been reported to be clinically effective in the treatment of scrub typhus in a few patients. However, some clinical studies suggest that fluoroquinolones are not as effective in patients with scrub typhus as other antibiotics (3-5).
