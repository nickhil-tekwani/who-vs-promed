From: Paul Levett <levett@sunbeach.net>

We should be careful about interpretation of serological results derived
from the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). The best that we say is that
there was presumptive evidence of serogroup Grippotyphosa infection.
Without isolates of leptospires for comparison, it is very difficult to
ascribe infection to a particular serovar solely on serological evidence.
In humans, it is often only possible to identify a presumptive serogroup
months after infection, after the acute rise in titres and when the
heterologous titres have fallen.
