Pakistan Health Authorities have reported an ongoing outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) typhoid fever that began in the Hyderabad district of Sindh province in November 2016. An increasing trend of typhoid fever cases caused by antimicrobial resistant (AMR) strains of _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi (or _S._ Typhi) poses a notable public health concern. In May 2018, the case definitions for nonresistant, multidrug-resistant (MDR) and XDR typhoid fever were formally agreed by the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (RDSRU) in Karachi, following a review by an expert group of epidemiologists, clinicians and microbiologists from Pakistan. All typhoid fever cases reported from 2016 to 2018 were reviewed and classified according to these case definitions (see Table 1 at the source URL).

From 1 Nov 2016 through 9 Dec 2018, 5274 cases of XDR typhoid out of 8188 typhoid fever cases were reported by the Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (PDSRU) in Sindh province, Pakistan. In all, 69% of cases were reported in Karachi (the capital city), 27% in Hyderabad district, and 4% in other districts in the province (see Table 2 at the source URL). The circulating XDR strain of _S._ Typhi haplotype 58 was resistant to 1st- and 2nd-line antimicrobials as well as 3rd-generation cephalosporins. Informal reports of XDR typhoid cases occurring in other parts of Pakistan were made and required further verification.

In addition, from January to October 2018, there were reports indicating international transmission of the XDR typhoid strain through persons who had traveled to Pakistan. A total of 6 travel-associated cases of XDR typhoid were reported: one in the UK and 5 in the US. Of the travel-associated cases, 4 had visited or resided in Karachi (Sindh province), Lahore (Punjab province) and/or Islamabad in Pakistan. Details regarding these 4 cases are as follows:

- Two of the cases traveled to Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad.
- One case travelled only to Karachi.
- One case pending confirmation is a resident from Lahore with travel history to the US where he/she was diagnosed and treated. The case has since returned to Pakistan.
- Limited information is available about their mechanism of exposure or the exact date of onset of illness for these cases, but there is evidence that all the travel-associated cases were successfully treated.

Public health response
---------------------
In January 2017, the Government of Pakistan initiated a public health response to the increasing number of XDR typhoid fever cases in Sindh province. The resulting activities included the following: Community and school awareness campaigns on safe hygiene and sanitation practices were carried out in Hyderabad, including specific health education on hand hygiene, use of safe drinking water, and environmental sanitation. Water purification and sanitation activities were implemented, including distribution of chlorine tablets to affected communities in Hyderabad. General practitioners and clinicians in Hyderabad were sensitized on the rational use of antimicrobials for typhoid fever by the Department of Health and partners, with support from the WHO.

A typhoid vaccination campaign was commenced on 5 Aug 2017 in Hyderabad with Vi-polysaccharide typhoid vaccine (ViPS). Approximately 6000 children 6 months to 10 years of age were vaccinated. A subsequent mass vaccination campaign with typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) was launched in Hyderabad in January 2018, resulting in approximately 118 000 children 6 months to 10 years of age being vaccinated to date. The government of Pakistan also applied for GAVI support for a 3-year phased TCV introduction into the routine National Program on Immunization, starting from 2019. Prior to the introduction, phased catch-up campaigns in urban areas will be conducted. The target age-group for this activity is children 9 months to 15 years of age.

The XDR National Taskforce was established in July 2018, and a joint WHO and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) mission was founded. Recommendations from these collaborations are currently being translated into a draft national action plan in Pakistan.

Updated surveillance tools and a line listing template for data collection on typhoid cases were shared with all the provincial departments of health on 7 Sep 2018. The purpose of this was to collect additional information and enhance surveillance, particularly about the occurrence and spread of XDR typhoid to other parts of Pakistan, and beyond. WHO has been leading initiatives to make a sustained difference in the continuing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). These initiatives include the following:

- The Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS): A standardized approach to the collection, analysis and sharing of data related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), including reports of emerging resistance via GLASS-EAR (Emerging Antimicrobial Resistance). The purpose of this activity was to inform decision-making and drive local, national and regional action. WHO supported the XDR National Task Force in Pakistan, chaired by the Director-General of Health, in the development of the National Action Plan on AMR.

- Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GARDP): A joint initiative of WHO and Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi), which encourages public-private research partnerships, including on typhoid fever.

WHO risk assessment
---------------------
The risk of XDR _S._ Typhi at the national level is considered high in Pakistan due to insufficient water, poor sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices, low vaccination coverage and limited surveillance for typhoid fever. The fact that AMR _S._ Typhi confirmatory testing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are conducted only by major laboratories and tertiary care hospitals is another priority consideration in terms of risk. These factors, coupled with suboptimal antibiotic prescribing practices, have limited the ability to track the occurrence, spread, and containment of XDR _S._ Typhi.

Outbreaks of MDR typhoid and sporadic cases of infection with ceftriaxone-resistant _S._ Typhi have been reported in several countries. However, this is the 1st time a large outbreak caused by XDR _S._ Typhi has been observed in Pakistan. The risk at the regional level is considered moderate due to the similar environments and approaches to treatment of typhoid fever, as well as the widespread overuse of antimicrobials, which is compounded by considerable levels of migration within the region.

Globally, the risk is considered low due to the availability of antimicrobials and rational prescribing practices. However, _S._ Typhi has a global distribution and the potential for travelers to spread this resistant clone, especially in countries with poor WASH infrastructure, cannot be eliminated. The high level of resistance to traditional 1st-line antimicrobials in the H58 clonal strain identified to be circulating in parts of Pakistan increases the potential risk at all 3 levels.

WHO recommendations
----------------------
This outbreak highlights the importance of public health measures to prevent the spread of resistant and nonresistant pathogens. While the emerging resistance in _S._ Typhi complicates treatment, typhoid fever remains common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation, hygiene among food handlers, and typhoid vaccination are the main and most important recommendations.

WHO recommends typhoid vaccination in response to confirmed outbreaks of typhoid fever, and travelers to typhoid-endemic areas should consider vaccination. Further, where the TCV is licensed, WHO recommends TCV as the preferred typhoid vaccine. Typhoid vaccination should be implemented in combination with other efforts to control the disease.

In view of the observed capacity for _S._ Typhi to quickly acquire new resistance mechanisms, WHO recommends strengthening surveillance of typhoid fever, including surveillance of AMR to monitor known resistance, detect new and emerging resistance, and mitigate its spread. WHO also recommends that surveillance data are shared locally and internationally in a timely manner.

Currently, azithromycin is the only remaining reliable and affordable 1st-line oral therapeutic option to treat patients with XDR typhoid in low-resource settings. Patients with suspected typhoid fever should be tested microbiologically to detect _S._ Typhi and define antimicrobial susceptibility wherever possible to inform patient treatment and contribute to the surveillance efforts. Verification and advanced testing (including molecular methods) of _S._ Typhi strains with unusual resistance should be performed by designated expert laboratories that provide confirmatory testing, where such capacity exists within countries. In countries where no laboratory capacity currently exists, regional collaboration may be an option, whereby a neighboring country's reference laboratory or a WHO Collaborating Center can fulfill this role.

[The following is extracted from the CDC notice regarding this multiply-resistant typhoid strain in Pakistan (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/xdr-typhoid-fever-pakistan):

The XDR strain of _Salmonella_ Typhi is resistant to most antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone) used to treat typhoid fever. Healthcare providers should:
- Obtain a complete travel history (asking about travel to South Asia, including Pakistan) from patients with suspected typhoid fever.
- Collect stool and blood cultures from patients with suspected typhoid fever and request antimicrobial susceptibility testing on isolates.
- Be aware that the Pakistan outbreak strain remains susceptible to azithromycin and carbapenems. Azithromycin is effective for uncomplicated (diarrhea or bacteremia without secondary complications) typhoid fever and should be used to treat patients with suspected uncomplicated typhoid fever who have traveled to Pakistan. When culture and sensitivity results are available, adjust treatment accordingly. Adult azithromycin dosage is usually 1000 mg orally once, then 500 mg orally daily OR 1000 mg orally once daily for at least 5-7 days. Pediatric azithromycin dose is 20 mg/kg orally, once then 10-20 mg/kg orally once per day (maximum 1000 mg per day) for at least 5-7 days.
- Carbapenems should be used for patients with suspected severe or complicated typhoid fever who have traveled to Pakistan. Severe or complicated typhoid fever would include, but not be limited to, patients with gastrointestinal complications (such as typhoid-related intestinal perforation, peritonitis, intestinal hemorrhage, hepatitis), neurologic complications (such as typhoid encephalopathy, including altered consciousness, delirium, confusion), or bacteremia with sepsis or shock. When culture and sensitivity results are available, adjust treatment accordingly. Consider getting an infectious diseases consultation for these patients.
- Be aware that relapses can occur, often 1-3 weeks after clinical improvement.
- Be aware that most (90%) _S._ Typhi isolates from patients coming from South Asia have decreased susceptibility or resistance to fluoroquinolones, including ciprofloxacin; therefore, fluoroquinolones should not be used as empiric treatment for suspected typhoid fever in patients who have traveled to this area.
- Report all cases of confirmed typhoid fever to the appropriate local or state health departments.
