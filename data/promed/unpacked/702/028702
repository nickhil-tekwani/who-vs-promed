Reference: rabies in Zambia and information about availability of RIG in
developing countries. I do not know about African countries but in most of
the developing countries of Asia, where rabies in humans continues to be a
major public health problem, availability and utilization of RIG is
practically negligible.
In India, around 120 litre of crude antirabies serum of equine origin (ARS)
is produced but even this is not utilized. It is estimated that around 1
million undergo antirabies immunization every year in India. RIG and
purified equine antirabies serum (ERIG) are now available (though imported)
yet their high cost and a lack of recognition among the medical fraternity
about their utility has restricted their optimal utilization.
Of late, tissue culture vaccines (Vero cell based as well as primary chick
embryo cell lines) have gained wide acceptance and more than 2.5 million
doses are being utilized annually. This is in addition to 35-40 million ml
of Semple's sheep brain derived vaccine that is used in India every year.
In the absence of any comprehensive rabies control programme, burgeoning
population of unowned dogs and lack of knowledge among general public and
medical professionals, this utilization is bound to increase in times to
come. I am sure the situation is no different in African countries.
