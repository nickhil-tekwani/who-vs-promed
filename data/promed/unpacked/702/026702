Central Bangladesh braces for deluge - diarrhea attacks 50 000
-----------------------------------------------
Continuing floods, which have already created havoc in 2/3 of the districts
of the country, are fast approaching the capital of Dhaka, placing millions
of people, without the prospect of adequate relief, at risk for outbreaks
of water-borne disease.
The Health Directorate Control Room said that waterborne diseases, like
diarrhea, had broken out in the flood-affected areas, including Comilla,
Gaibandha, Pabna, Narayanganj, Tangail, Brahmanbaria, Barisal, Sunamganj,
Sylhet, Jamalpur, Netrokona, Habiganj, Moulvibazar, and Dhaka. The bulletin
of the control room said that some 3000 people were struck by diarrhea
during last 48 hours. But, unofficial sources reported that the number of
diarrhea patients in the affected areas stood at 50 000 by Fri 23 Jul 2004.
Our correspondents from different affected areas add that water-borne
diseases have been spreading in an epidemic form, while the victims are
facing acute shortages of oral saline, water purification tablets, and
proper medical services.

[2] Diarrhea & Cholera - Philippines (Pangasinan) (03)

The World Health Organization (WHO) is willing to help the Philippines
address the problem posed by cholera, particularly in Pangasinan, where 81
cases of vibrio cholera were found from among the 2055 patients afflicted
with acute gastroenteritis.
This information was conveyed by a team of medical experts sent to Dagupan
last Thu 15 Jul 2004, by Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit, to assess the
situation, and, the operation of Department of Health (DoH) personnel in
the field against cholera.
Dagupan City has become the DoH regional office's center for operations in
the fight against cholera, which, records show, is still raging in 38 of
the 48 towns and cities of Pangasinan.
DoH Regional Director Eduardo Janairo said his staff, including sanitary
engineers, has submitted, to the DoH team, a "wish list" of equipment and
facilities they would like the WHO to deliver to Pangasinan to boost the
efforts toward stopping the cholera outbreak.
The WHO has placed the Philippines under its cholera "watch list," after it
required DoH to report the cases of cholera that it encountered.
Janairo said this wish list would be a big boost in the fight against
cholera, because the DoH lacks logistics, such as chlorine testing kits,
equipment to identify the potability of water, chlorine, and others
materials which the local government units may not be able to buy.

[4] Diarrhea - Sudan (Darfur) and Chad

Relief efforts for war-displaced in Darfur and Chad must be doubled now
-----------------------------------------------
The international humanitarian response to the crisis in Darfur, Sudan, and
eastern Chad must be boosted immediately, and dramatically, to save
hundreds of thousands of lives that may be lost because of rising levels of
disease and malnutrition.
IRC (International Rescue Committee) health teams in Darfur and Chad
report increasing cases of diarrhea and dysentery, and, the growing threat
of cholera, and other predatory diseases such as measles and typhoid.
According to the World Health Organization, a cholera epidemic, striking up
to 300 000, could break out within weeks, now that heavy rains have begun.
When health and social services are interrupted by war, death rates soar.
The IRC documented this in the Democratic Republic of Congo where
mortality surveys found that, between 1999 and 2003, over 3 million people
died, most of them from disease in the absence of a functioning health system.
Vast security and logistical improvements, unhindered access, and a
doubling, if not tripling, of humanitarian relief programs are necessary to
meet the needs of 1.2 million uprooted Sudanese. These measures will
require a focused, and cooperative, effort by the UN, the African Union
(AU), major international and regional powers, the donor community, and
NGOs. While it is recognized that efforts are underway, with the Government
of Sudan, to work through political and security issues, we urge that the
same effort, if not more, be focused on doubling humanitarian capacity on
the ground.

Cholera hits Bundibugyo
------------------------
A cholera epidemic has hit the district, with 3 people dead and 10 admitted
to different hospitals. The most affected areas include Rwangara and
Nyahuka sub-counties, and, some parts surrounding Bundibugyo town. The
district director of health services, Dr. Sekyewunda, confirmed the reports
without giving the identities of the dead and the admitted persons.
Sekyewunda said the deceased patients died in Kanara sub-county, and the
remaining patients are hospitalized at Rwangara Health Center in critical
condition. "We have provided drugs to treat the patients," Sekyewunda said.
He called for improved sanitary conditions in the area. Health workers told
The Monitor that other people were admitted at Nyahuka Health Center, near
the Uganda-DR Congo border.
The Vice Chairman LC3 Kanara sub-county, Mr. Ambrose Amumpe Museveni, said
he visited the health center and found the cholera cases being treated
under tree sheds due to over-crowding. He said the measure was a precaution
against infecting other patients.

2 residents of Kaseke village, in Naguru Parish II, Nakawa division, were
recently admitted to the Mulago Hospital with cholera. Nakawa resident
district commissioner Samuel Hashaka said that the hardest hit areas were
in Nakawa and Kawempe divisions.
He said cases were cited in Kaseke village, Mbuya II parish, and Luzira
Prison parish, all in Nakawa division.
Hashaka said other areas on high alert were Mulago, Nsoba, Kamokya, and
Kifumbira parish in Kawempe division, where most latrines have been filled
to the brim. He attributed the outbreak to Kampala City Council's laxity to
empty the VIP latrines.
"It's not hygienic to see families continue visiting latrines already
filled to top with maggots moving out. VIP latrines should be emptied
regularly, and this is KCC's job," he said.

[7] Cholera - Cameroon

<http://www.panapress.com>

Around 128 people have died, out of 6377 affected by cholera, since the
beginning of 2004, according to the Ministry of Public Health. The most
affected provinces are the coastal, west, southwest, extreme north, south,
and central. The capital, Yaounde, is now infected, with 21 cases reported
in 2 weeks. [Compare 26 deaths out of 2048 cases reported to WHO as of 20
May 2004. See Cholera, diarrhea & dysentery update 2004 (14) 20040628.1726.
- Mod.JW]
The causes most quoted are poor water quality and a lack of attention to
the rules of hygiene. An average of only 7 out of 10 families nationwide
have access to potable water, and, only 44 percent of families do in
Yaounde, according to the national water authority.

[8] Cholera - Austria ex India

2 cases of imported cholera from India in Austrian travelers
----------------------------------------------
2 confirmed cholera cases (_Vibrio cholerae_ 01, subserotype Inaba, biotype
El Tor) were reported to the Austrian ministry of health by the Vienna
Regional Health Board, and the national cholera reference laboratory in
Vienna, on 2 Jun 2004. Both cases were in 58-year-old Austrian men who
admitted themselves to the Allgemeines Krankenhaus Wien (Vienna General
Hospital) directly after arrival at Vienna International Airport on 26 May
2004, because they were suffering from diarrhea.
Patient 1 had become ill on 20 May 2004, and, received intravenous
re-hydration in the outpatient department of the Medical University of
Vienna's Division of Infectious Diseases, starting on 27 May 2004, because
of the severity of his illness. Patient 2 fell ill on 23 May 2004, but, was
not severely ill, and left Vienna to take another holiday in the Austrian
region of Styria on 28 May 2004.
Stool samples were taken from both patients, and routinely investigated for
_V. cholerae_ (culture). On 2 Jun 2004, when the diagnosis was confirmed,
patient 1 was kept in hospital isolation, and hygiene control measures were
reinforced. Patient 2 was kept in private isolation at his hotel in
Grobming, Styria, and, was visited daily by the district public health
officer. After 2 negative stool samples from each patient, they were both
released from isolation. Stool samples were taken twice from each family
member, and all tested negative.
The travel history revealed that the 2 friends had traveled to India on 24
Apr 2004 for a private trekking tour, where they were accompanied by 3
Indian Sherpa guides and an Indian cook. The travel route included Uttar
Pradesh, Hardwar, Rishikesh, and Kedarnath, and a boat trip on the Ganges.
The travelers had not been vaccinated against cholera but used the usual
preventive measures for travelers, such as water disinfection and hand washing.
They both traveled back from New Delhi to Vienna on a direct Austrian
Airlines flight on 27 May 2004. Investigations revealed that approximately
230 passengers were booked on the flight, most of whom were Indian citizens
taking connecting flights to London, New York, and Paris. A passenger list
could not be provided, because the check-in at Delhi was administered by
Indian Airlines. Attempts by Austrian Airlines to obtain the list were
unsuccessful, and so, no identification of passengers, who continued their
journey beyond Vienna, was possible.
However, only a minor infection risk for the co-travelers existed: the
patients were seated in economy class on the lower deck, and no other
passengers were seated in the same row of seats. After using the lavatory
in economy class, both patients reported careful hand washing with soap and
water. Additionally, no contact with other people, such as handshaking, was
reported, and no medical help was required. According to Austrian Airlines,
no crew members reported having diarrhea.
In accordance with Decision 2119/98, the Austrian ministry of health
immediately informed other European Union member states about the cholera
cases via the Early Warning and Response System. In accordance with
International Health Regulations, the World Health Organization Regional
Office for Europe was also informed.
