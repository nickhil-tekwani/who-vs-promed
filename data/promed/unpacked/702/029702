African swine fever in Nigeria
---------------------------------
Information received on 5 Aug 2005 from Dr. Foluso Emman Fasanmi,
Director of the Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services,
Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Abuja:
Report date: 28 Jul 2005.
African swine fever (ASF) was diagnosed in 3 farms in Abeokuta Local
Government Area, Ogun state.
Location of the infected farms:
- University farm;
- Fajol area;
- Olarunshogo.
Date of start of the event: 1 Jul 2005.
Total number of animals in the outbreaks: 229.
Number of deaths: at least 65.
Description of affected population: all age categories are affected,
both sexes. Mortality was reported mainly in adults. The pigs at the
University farm are kept under an intensive system of management,
while the ones in the other 2 affected farms are fed water from a
communal spring.
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: fomites (humans,
vehicles, feed, etc.). It is thought that the infection may have
spread into the country from Benin, which shares a border with the
affected state. This was the source of spread of the infection into
Nigeria previously. However, detailed investigation is being carried
out, while effort is being made to limit the spread of the infection
in the country.
Control measures
A. Undertaken:
- partial stamping out;
- quarantine;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
- regular radio broadcast is being aired to alert pig farmers and
advise them on preventive measures to take.
B. To be undertaken:
- stamping out;
- movement control inside the country.

[African Swine Fever continues to be a big problem in West Africa.
The outbreak area is close to that reported a few years previously by
Tayo Babalola of the University of Ibadan. He also recently sent in
information about an outbreak in Ghana. Such reporting is very much
appreciated. - Mod.PC]
