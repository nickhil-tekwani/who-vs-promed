Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Aug 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1250 / 15 / 2 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Fattening calves
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: illegal movement of animals, fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc)

Epidemiological comments: Foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus serotype A was detected by ELISA in Central Veterinary Laboratory. Then, the samples were sent to the Pirbright Institute for advanced analysis. The Pirbright Institute categorized this strain as "Genotype VII" in FMD Genotyping Report dated 4 Dec 2015. Samples were collected from fattening calves illegally introduced in a big fattening complex. The origin of these calves was traced to Miyandoab live animal market located in West Azarbijan province [West Azerbaijan Province].

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, no treatment of affected animals

Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
Qom / Cattle / 28 800 / Merial/Razi polyvalent vaccine
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central veterinary Laboratory of Iran Veterinary Organization (National laboratory) / Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 4 Jun 2015 / positive
The Pirbright Institute (OIE Reference Laboratory) / Cattle / gene sequencing / 2 Dec 2015 / Positive

[According to the report, the source of the infection was due to the illegal entry of calves from the Miyandoab live animal market located in the province of West Azarbijan. This province is located close to the Turkish border where FMD serotype A Asia, genotype VII has been declared endemic; see ProMED archive 20151229.3899816. Therefore, it should not be unexpected that this new strain of FMD has now been reported in Iran.

West Azarbaijan Province is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is in the northwest of the country, bordering Turkey, Iraq and Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, and the provinces of East Azarbaijan, Zanjan and Kurdistan. The province is part of Region 3. It is separated from Armenia by Turkey's short border with the Azerbaijan Republic. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Azerbaijan_Province, see location of this province at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Azerbaijan_Province#/media/File:Locator_map_Iran_West_Azerbaijan_Province.png.

There seems to be an inconsistency in the report regarding the date of the initial outbreak (30 Aug 2015) and the date when the disease was first diagnosed by the national laboratory (4 Jun 2015). This needs clarification.

According to publicly available information, (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Vaccines/manufacturer_list.php?manufacturer=38&lang=en), the Merial/Razi polyvalent FMD vaccine, applied in Iran, protects against serotypes O, A and Asia-1. It would be of interest to know the effectiveness of this Iranian vaccine against the new FMD strain serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII." - Mods.CRD/AS
