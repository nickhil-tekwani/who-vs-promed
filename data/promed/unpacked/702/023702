A Taiwanese businessman in China has been infected with H7N9 avian influenza virus, the 3rd such case among that group of people [?], Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Tue [12 Jan 2016].

The CDC said it had contacted Chinese health authorities to confirm the case, based on information received from the man's son.

The businessman's son alerted quarantine officials in Taiwan of the possible case after visiting his father in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, earlier in January 2016, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw

Chou said it was the son's 2nd visit following 1 in December [2015]. On 5 Jan [2016], the son was alerted that his father was seriously ill and went to China again but was unable to make contact because his father was in an intensive care unit in a hospital, the CDC said.

The father, son, other family members and friends were tested in China on 5 Jan [2016] and the son tested negative, while the father tested positive for the H7N9 virus, the CDC said, adding that the results became available Mon [11 Jan 2016].

When the 26-year-old son returned to Taipei Songshan Airport on 8 Jan [2016], his temperature was normal and he showed no signs of illness but he took the initiative to alert quarantine officials that he might have had contact with suspected H7N9 patients.

Quarantine officials decided that the risks of the man being infected with the avian flu virus were not high and they offered him health advice and suggested that he conduct health management at home.

The CDC, however, contacted its counterpart in China the same night to check whether the father was infected with the virus.

"The CDC wished to thank the man who was alert enough to inform us upon his return of his possible contact with the virus," Chou said.

He said the CDC will keep track of the health situation of the man and his father.

If necessary, he said, the CDC will send doctors to Kunshan to obtain information about the treatment of the businessman there and provide health advice to other Taiwanese in the area.

There have been 23 confirmed H7N9 cases in China since autumn 2015 -- 14 cases in Zhejiang province, 3 each in Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces, 2 in Shanghai, and 1 in Jiangxi. Most of the patients were over 50 years old and had been exposed to birds or poultry.

Since 2013, 700 cases of H7N9 have been reported worldwide -- 680 in China, 13 in Hong Kong, 4 in Taiwan (all imported), 2 in Canada and 1 in Malaysia.

[We are beginning to see daily reports of H7N9 avian influenza cases in China this transmission season (wave 4). Each winter since H7N9 was initially detected in China in humans (early 2013), southern China has witnessed human infections. The virus has become well established in poultry populations, where it causes little to no illness, in southeastern parts of the country; however the virus can cause mild to severe disease in humans, and in some cases death. FAO marked the beginning of Wave 4 on 2 Oct [2015] after Chinese authorities in Zhejiang Province reported the first 2 human cases since July [2015].

It is not clear what exactly is meant by "people from that group", although I (Mod LK) suspect it may mean Taiwanese businessmen. That being said, I have not seen previous reports of Taiwanese businessmen being infected with H7N9.

There is no mention of whether this is a primary or secondary case, i.e., did the businessman have contact with infected poultry (primary) or a sick individual (secondary). Most of the avian influenza H7N9 cases that have been reported have been primary cases.
