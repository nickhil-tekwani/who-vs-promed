The second case of raccoon rabies was confirmed on Monday
after an attack on a collie dog. Farmers in the area around Ontario
are fearful for their livestock.
After attacking the dog, the raccoon scrambled up a tree, but was
then shot by the homeowner. The Sunday-morning attack was west
of the village of North Augusta, around Atkin Lake, about 15 km
north of Brockville.
Dr. Rick Rosatte, rabies-control expert with the ministry of natural
resources, met with about 20 residents in the area. "I explained to
them it's just another strain of rabies. I told them not to panic."
Rosatte said the residents have "great concern" for their farm
animals, which might have to be quarantined if the disease is found
on a farm.
He said he asked the residents for their cooperation in allowing the
ministry to set traps on their property.
Rosatte has trappers in the area who are collecting skunks and
raccoons in a 5 km radius of the new case. They will be killed and
their brains tested. Within an additional 5 km radius, they will be
trapped and vaccinated.
Results of tests from the zone surrounding the first case, about 15
km away, show no cases of rabies, says Dr. Elliot Salsberg, a
veterinarian with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, which runs
the lab near Ottawa where the specimens are tested.
A total of 523 specimens were tested, from the first outbreak --
439 raccoons and 84 skunks -- and all were negative, he said.
The animals have to be destroyed to prevent the virulent strain
from spreading to southern Ontario's population of one million
raccoons, said Rosatte.

[Perhaps someone inside the Canadian ministry can tell us why the
oral rabies vaccine program, which has proven safe, effective and
cost efficient, is not being utilized? It requires fewer man-hours
(less labor intensive) and vaccinates a larger number of animals
than can be trapped and vaccinated. - Mod.TG
