I care for a group of 1,000 US citizens living in Saudi Arabia. From here
people frequently travel all over the world and are exposed to influenza in
both hemispheres. The current influenza vaccination we are using is the USA
formulation. As this population is exposed year round, and given the
apparently short lived antibody levels from current vaccinations, as
demonstrated in today's posting of the study in Canada, is there any
justification to repeating the vaccination at shorter intervals than
annually?
Also, while following the comments concerning the protection afforded by
this vaccination to the elderly population resident in long-term care
facilities, I wonder if there would be justification to repeating this
vaccination at say, twelve weeks during influenza season. Also, isn't there
any booster effect with this vaccination when the same component is used
several years running? For example, if the same B component has been used
for five years in a row in Canada, wouldn't the population demonstrate a
booster effect and greater protection after the second or third dose than
the first?
For high risk individuals such as the staff of a nursing home, or the
medical staff of a hospital emergency department caring for people with
influenza during influenza season, would there be justification in giving
the vaccination before the start of the influenza season and then repeating
it after two or three months?

[I sent the above to Dr. David Morens for comment and his response appears
below. - Mod.ES
Dr. Hargis brings up some interesting points. Perhaps ProMED-mail
subscribers have answers to some of the questions he poses, all of which
relate to the poor immunogenicity of, and the short duration of protection
afforded by, the current inactivated vaccines. For people who travel in
both hemispheres (and perhaps also for people who work in the tropics, per
a related question from Dr. Steve Wignall in Irian Jaya), might it be
desirable to seek influenza vaccination every six months, to extend the
duration of protection and catch up with the new antigens? (Based on the
observation that the two hemispheres have influenza seasons that are six
months apart, and vaccine formulations may change over that time). I am
not aware that there are any good data on the subject, nor do I recall
seeing data on short-interval revaccination to boost or extend immunity in
other populations. Many epidemiologic data show poor protection, and
little "carryover" protection, from repeated annual vaccination. This may
be due to poor immunogenicity compounded by "drift" in critical HA or other
epitopes over time. The duration of protection following vaccination may
not be known precisely, and probably varies between population risk groups.
Certainly there is little evidence of protection after 12 months, but
since a typical influenza season may last as long as 6-7 months, is
unpredictable in onset (between October and January is common in the U.S.),
and always requires a vaccination lead time, it might be that influenza
revaccination during a season could increase protection for some persons.
Are there any data on this subject?
