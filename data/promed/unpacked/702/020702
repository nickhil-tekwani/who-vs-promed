An 8 year old girl has died in Tunisia after suffering complications caused by shigella bacteria as officials warn of a wave of infections, health officials said on Wednesday [23 Nov 2022]. Tunis regional health director Tarek Ben Naceur announced the girl's death and told local radio station Mosaique FM that she was brought to the hospital too late for treatment to be effective in saving her life.

Shigella is a bacterium very similar to _Escherichia coli_ and causes dysentery, among other health issues.

Tunisian health authorities are concerned about the shigellosis outbreak among children. They said that 69 children have become sick from shigellosis and 11 have been admitted to Bab Saadoun Children's Hospital in Tunis. "The shigella bacteria can cause death, hence the need to take the necessary precautions," Mr Ben Naceur said. "Paying attention to hand hygiene and sterilizing vegetables and fruit before eating them is necessary to prevent contracting this bacterial infection."

Shigella infections cause diarrhoea, fever and stomach cramps. Symptoms usually begin a day or 2 after infection and last 7 days. Doctors say it is important to seek medical care at the onset of the symptoms to avoid further complications. Shigellosis can cause severe dehydration for children and can cause seizures leading to death if medical intervention is not sought in a timely manner.

[Of the 4 _Shigella_ species (_Shigella sonnei_, _S. flexneri_, _S. boydii_, and _S. dysenteriae_), _S. sonnei_ is the commonest species in the United States. Humans are the only reservoir for shigella, which are easily transmitted person-to-person because shigella are relatively resistant to gastric acidity, and only a few (10-100) organisms, if swallowed, will survive passage through the stomach and be sufficient to establish infection in the lower intestinal tract.

Shigellosis due to _S. sonnei_ is usually uncomplicated with recovery within a week in most patients. However, patients with underlying diseases, such as malnutrition, cancer, or immune suppression are more likely to remain sick for a longer time (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/symptoms.html#4-2). About 2% of those infected, usually with _S. flexneri_, develop a syndrome, called post-infectious reactive arthritis (formerly called Reiter syndrome), with pains in their joints, irritation of the eyes, and painful urination. Reactive arthritis has also been associated with gastrointestinal infections due to salmonella, campylobacter, and other organisms.

_S. dysenteriae_ infection can be complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), also caused by certain serotypes of _E. coli_, such as O157:H7, resulting in hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney failure. HUS is the leading cause of death in _S. dysenteriae_ outbreaks (https://www.cdc.gov/shigella/symptoms.html#4-2). Rarely shigellosis can lead to bloodstream infections with shigella or other enteric Gram negative bacilli, most commonly seen in shigellosis caused by _S. flexneri_ and _S. dysenteriae_. Seizures can complicate shigellosis caused by any of the _Shigella_ species. Shigellosis can also cause toxic megacolon, which can lead to intestinal perforation and peritonitis (https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/bjs.1800761132).

The organisms are spread via hands, mouth, food, or water that have come into contact with the stool of a person infected with shigella. Although shigellosis is usually self-limited in 5-7 days without antibiotic treatment, antibiotics are commonly used to decrease fecal excretion of the organism that may otherwise last up to several weeks and for severe cases that have prolonged dysentery or sepsis. However, resistance to antimicrobials has restricted treatment options.

ProMED very recently reported on an emerging outbreak of shigellosis in Tunisia due to a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain of _S. sonnei_ (ProMED poat Shigellosis - Africa: Tunisia, Shigella sonnei, MDR, RFI 20221123.8706869). However, we were not told of its MDR pattern. Antimicrobial resistance markers found on other MDR _Shigella_ have included blaCTX-M-27, which encodes an extended-spectrum Î²-lactamase (ESBL), a gyrA mutation associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and the macrolide resistance markers erm(B) and mph(A). Consequently, treatment of infections caused by MDR strain with fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone is unlikely to be effective. TMP/SMX had been one of the drugs of choice for the treatment of shigellosis, but emerging resistance to this antimicrobial drug limited its empiric use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462054/).

More information on this outbreak in Tunisia would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources to shed light on the circumstances surrounding the death of this 8 year old with shigellosis. - Mod.ML
