On 19 Jun 2004, 2 men slaughtered 2 cows with signs of disease (nasal
bleeding) without veterinary investigation. The carcass was cut into 12
parts and given out to 5 families. The families are residents of a region
of Zhem city. All of them have a clinical and epidemiological diagnosis [of
human cutaneous anthrax]. They have carbuncles on the left and right hands.
The state of health of the 6 patients is critical, and one of them is
in grave condition. Laboratory investigation is not complete. There is
serological and bacteriological confirmation [of human cutaneous anthrax].
On 1 Jul 2004, 7 patients were hospitalized [moved] from Zhem city (former
Yemba city) to Aktobe oblast [provincial] (RK) hospital.

On Thu 1 Jul 2004, in Koksu village in Kazakhstan's Aktiubin oblast (in the
western part of the country), 6 people, aged 12 to 64, showed symptoms of
the cutaneous form of anthrax.
As announced to Interfaks-Kazakhstan on Fri 2 Jul 2004 at the Agency
for Emergency Situations, the 6 were found during an inspection of
households undertaken after a 40-year-old local was hospitalized with an
analogous diagnosis last Thu 24 Jun 2004. That resident, in the doctors'
opinion, came down with the dangerous infection while dismembering a
slaughtered cow on 19 Jun 2004.
All patients have been hospitalized in the Mugalzharskii regional hospital
in Emba.
According to the Agency for Emergency Situations, doctors have found 78
people who had contact with the patients, including 66 in Emba and 12 in
Koksu. Anti-epidemic measures are being taken. [I wonder what these are.
Anthrax is not spread between humans by contact, nor by coughs or sneezes. -
