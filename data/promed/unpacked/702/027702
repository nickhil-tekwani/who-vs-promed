Foot-and-mouth outbreak sparks concern in South America
-------------------------------------------
Agricultural officials from 7 South American countries declared a regional
alert Friday due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], they said
in a statement issued at the close of a meeting in Bolivia.
Agricultural ministers or their deputies from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Peru held a one-day meeting Friday in the
Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra to discuss the matter.
The gathering was called by the Bolivian government after an outbreak of
the animal disease was detected along the tri-national border of Bolivia,
Paraguay, and Argentina.
In their statement the ministers called for a "regional fight against this
scourge," which they said had reached the level of a "health emergency" in
Bolivia and Paraguay.
They called for a "massive vaccination strategy" and said they would ask
international organizations for "immediate financing for the plan" to
immunize livestock in affected areas.
The group has set a goal of eradicating FMD in the region before 2009.
FMD is a highly contagious virus that affects mainly sheep, pigs, and
cattle, but not humans.
Countries in the region went on the alert earlier this month after 15 cases
of FMD were discovered in the community of Pozo Hondo, Paraguay, 3
kilometers (1.8 miles) from the Argentine border and 7 kilometers (4 miles)
from Bolivia.
Bolivia last week slapped a 90-day ban on livestock from Paraguay and
Argentina, after detecting the virus in animals in Chuquisaca, southeastern
Bolivia, near the triple border. Argentina has also suspended livestock
trade with its 2 neighbors, hoping to preserve its status as a country free
of FMD.
The Organization of International Epizootics (OIE) most recently certified
Argentina as "FMD free with vaccination" on 10 Jul 2003, after conducting
tests on some 80 000 animals on 14 000 farms.
Chile is the only country in the region that has been certified by the OIE
as free of FMD without the use of vaccines.

not practised;
2. Member Countries recognised as FMD free countries where vaccination is
