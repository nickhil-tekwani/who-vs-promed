Tiger reserves alerted after anthrax scare on TN border
-------------------------------------------------------
Spores of the dreadful anthrax, once a major killer of mammals and cattle, are in the air and have already killed an elephant calf in Thalavadi range of Thalamalai Reserve Forest in Sathyamangalam Forest Division. Considering the danger it could pose to wildlife, state tiger reserves have been alerted and directed to maintain a vigil and initiate precautionary measures.

The carcass of the 10-year-old male jumbo was found near Kodapampalli Thoddi village in Thalavadi range. The postmortem revealed that the animal had died of anthrax, said N. Sathish, DFO [Divisional Forest Officer], Sathyamangalam forest division. No other wild animal has been detected with anthrax as of now but forest officials are not taking any chances. They have started chlorinating water bodies in Thalavadi range while the animal husbandry department has been directed to carry out ring vaccination of cattle to avoid spread of the spores, which could trigger a catastrophe in the animal population.

Acknowledging the gravity of the situation, Ajai Mishra, Chief Conservator of Forests (Project Elephant) said officials of Biligiri Ranganatha Swamy tiger reserve, Bandipur tiger reserve and Kollegal forest division have been told to constitute monitoring teams to keep track of elephant movement. "It's definitely a cause for concern but there is nothing to panic about," Mr Mishra said.

[Tamil Nadu is much afflicted with anthrax in its livestock; for example in 2008 (11 outbreaks, with 24 cattle cases and 4 sheep), 2009 (4 outbreaks with 25 cattle cases), 2010 (bovine outbreaks 10, 32 cases, and 4 small ruminant outbreaks with 23 affected), 2011 (bovine outbreaks 4, 10 cases). While elephants can graze it is more likely, in the absence of other affected elephants, that this youngster was bitten by a fly after it had fed on some sick cattle or another [infected] wildlife species within the park. The good news is that it triggered a vaccination response to protect nearby cattle. Livestock vaccination in India is at best erratic.

The sanctuary is home to some 850 Indian elephants, making it the the largest elephant habitat in the country.
