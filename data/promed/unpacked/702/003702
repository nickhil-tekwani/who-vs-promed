A farmer in Raichur [district] uprooted [and burnt] some 3000 pomegranate trees [due to] bacterial blight. The deadly disease not only destroyed his farm, but also would have spread to nearby farms.

Chamarasa Mali Patil, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha [farmers' movement], urged the government to help pomegranate farmers. "This is the 1st victim of this disease in this region [of the district]. More farmers are likely to face this situation since the disease is spreading."

Farmers in [other areas of the district] said that around 70 acres [28.3 ha] of pomegranate farms had been infected by the bacterial blight [in some] villages. "The disease cannot be controlled after infection. The only way to save the crop is to take preventive measures," they said.

[Oily spot of pomegranate (also called bacterial blight, black spot) is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _punicae_. The main damage occurs on fruits which develop black spots and usually split resulting in enormous yield losses. Disease development and spread are favoured by cloudy weather and intermittent rainfall, and heavy rains are thought to be a triggering factor for epidemics.

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit, twigs, and cuttings), mechanical means (including insect and human activities), and wind-splashed rain. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures (as mentioned above), and bactericidal sprays containing antibiotics or copper. However, the latter may lead to rejection of exported fruit by some countries. No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily spot.

The disease has become an increasingly serious problem for Indian pomegranate growers in several states (see previous ProMED-mail posts below). In Karnataka, it is considered an epidemic and a threat to the industry with up to 85 percent incidence in the north. In Maharashtra, oily spot is considered the main disease of the crop with 100 percent infection in some orchards.

Another strain of the same species, _X. axonopodis_ pv. _citri_, causes citrus canker which poses a serious threat to citrus industries worldwide.
