The confirmation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever as the cause of 2 deaths in Paulinia (Sao Paulo) led the Health Department to initiate on Mon 13 Aug 2012 preventive and awareness activities in the areas infested with star ticks [_Amblyomma cajennense_ or Cayenne tick], near the River Atibaia. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks, for which the main host are capybaras.

The cases were diagnosed in the neighborhoods of Patropi and Jardim Planalto, on the banks of the river used by residents for fishing. The results of tests performed at the Adolfo Lutz Institute to determine the cause of death of a 57 year old man were confirmed on 9 Aug 2012. The other victim is a 33 year old woman who also had also had a chronic illness and died on 18 Jul 2012.

Neither received treatment for the disease because the diagnosis was made post mortem. In the early stages of the disease symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, severe headaches, and muscle aches, similar to other illnesses such as dengue or influenza, which make confirmation of the disease difficult.

Technicians of the Campinas Superintendency of Endemic Disease Control [SUCEN by its initials in Portuguese] placed traps and captured capybaras with infected ticks in the river. They also recommended the installation of signs [indicating the risk] of spotted fever and the distribution of pamphlets in the 8 basic health units, private clinics, and emergency rooms.

[The news report points to 2 frequent facts in relation to [Rocky Mountain spotted fever]: 1) the risk of infection in the proximity of catchment areas (rivers, ponds, fisheries), especially in the presence of capybaras, the main host of the vector, and 2) the potential lethality associated with the disease, related not only to the virulence of the bacterium, but also in large part to the low suspicion index and consequent late introduction, or, worse, the non introduction of the specific treatment.

The handling of capybaras, today an urban plague in many municipal districts, is one of the critical points in relation to the control of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, especially in urban areas (such as public parks and residential condominiums) of medium and large cities.

The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _R. rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever.

The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA including the Rocky Mountains and also in parts of southern Canada, Central, and South America. - Mod.LL
