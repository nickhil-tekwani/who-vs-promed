Comment: leishmaniasis in Southern Europe
-----------------------------------------
Mod. EP wrote: "The data on human cases in Spain clearly shows that
leishmaniasis is a problem which need to be considered in all febrile
patients with unexplained fever of a longer duration who has visited Spain".
It is true, there several are reports on cases related to visits to Spain.
However, It is not only travel to Spain that needs to be considered as a
(little) risk in Southwestern Europe. Some regions and islands of Southeast
France and Italy and Portugal are well known foci of leishmaniasis. These
areas could be considered as hypoendemic. The risk is not only related to
the prevalence of infected dogs, but also, and more important, to visitors,
[during the month of the presence of the vector (usually May-October in
Spain).
>Co-infection Leishmania/HIV is considered as re-emerging diseases by the
WHO (data 1990-98: 835 Spain, 259 France, 229 Italy, 117 Portugal. I don't
know if these data are population based or selected institutional based in
each country. Source WHO/LEISH/2000.42).
There is under-reporting in official data on leishmaniasis, mostly passive.
It is an important problem also in developed countries. I think, the
outstanding question from the German case is that, as Tomas Jelinek said,
"only very few cases of probable [transplacental infection with
_Leishmania_ spp. have been published:" the mother was asymptomatic.

Canine leishmaniasis occurs in all Mediterranean countries. In dogs
cutaneous and visceral forms of the disease cannot be separated. Animals
with cutaneous symptoms usually have visceral leishmania[sis and vice
versa. Every tourist who looks closely enough at stray dogs at the
Akropolis in Athens can recognize the cutaneous form of leishmaniasis on
the nose and the ears of these animals. Treatment does reduce clinical
disease but does not clear the host of parasites.

[Clearly, leishmaniasis in not a disease that should be regarded only as
"tropical", but is a present problem in Europe. Remember to check febrile
patients from Southern Europe or patients who have visited Southern Europe.
