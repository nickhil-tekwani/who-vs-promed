TRYPANOSOMIASIS, AFRICAN - SUDAN
********************************
[Thanks to all who sent in copies of the report. The following is an
abstract - Mod.JW]

On Friday 18 July 1997 the New York Times ran a front page story by James C.
McKinley Jr on this emerging problem.

In 1990, guerilla forces in the Southern Sudan moved west towards the Zaire
(now Dem.Rep.Congo) border. All health services closed down and thousands
of people fled into Zaire and the Central African Republic, into areas
infested with the tsetse fly, which carries sleeping sickness. In 1994 CARE
and other charities restarted health services. In Tambura, Sudan, the
number of cases seen was 18 in 1995, 87 in 1996 and more than 100 already
this year. In April 1997 a team from CDC Atlanta carried out a study and
found that 37% of 440 people tested in Ezo (pop. 8000) are infected, and 21%
of the 21 500 people in the surrounding area.
The disease can be cured, but a course of the drug Pentamidine costs
anywhere from $170-$500, and a followup drug, Melarsoprol, costs $100 per
patient. Just to treat the estimated 3000 people in Tambura County who are
estimated to be infected would cost more than $1 million. Then there are
all those infected people across the border. A regional control program is
needed.
