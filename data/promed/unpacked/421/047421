The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) is reporting that influenza A (H1N2)v has been identified as the strain that sickened 2 attendees of the Fowlerville Family Fair following exposure to swine. Respiratory samples from ill individuals were sent to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for additional testing, after initially testing positive for influenza A at the MDHHS Laboratory last week [week of 30 Jul 2018]. This H1N2v strain is similar to the viruses currently circulating in swine.

These are among the 1st influenza A (H1N2)v virus infections identified in the US in 2018. 2 additional cases have been identified in California. None of the patients were hospitalized, and all are recovering from their illness. No human-to-human transmission has been identified to date. Investigation of additional ill fair attendees is ongoing.

Since reporting of novel influenza A viruses began nationally in 2005, only 17 human infections of influenza A (H1N2)v -- including these 2 Michigan cases -- have been reported to CDC.

Swine influenza is a respiratory disease in pigs caused by type A influenza viruses that regularly circulate among swine. Swine influenza viruses do not usually infect humans, but human infections have been reported. People cannot get swine influenza from eating properly prepared pork or handling pork products - only from contact with an ill pig. The fair took place [23-28 Jul 2018], and several pigs from the fair tested positive for swine influenza on [27 Jul 2018].

Symptoms of swine influenza in people are similar to the seasonal flu and can include fever, cough, runny nose, and sometimes body aches, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. On rare occasions, swine influenza in humans can lead to severe diseases, such as pneumonia or death.

Those at higher risk of developing complications if they get swine influenza include children younger than 5 years of age, people 65 years of age and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic health issues, such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, weakened immune systems and neurological conditions.

Currently, there is no vaccine for swine influenza, and the seasonal flu vaccine will not protect against it. However, antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu and Relenza, are effective in treating swine influenza. Early treatment works best and may be especially important for people with a high-risk condition.

Steps you can take to protect yourself and prevent the spread of any illness:
- refrain from eating or drinking in livestock barns or show rings;
- do not take toys, pacifiers, cups, baby bottles, strollers or similar items into pig areas;
- anyone who is at high risk of serious flu complications and is planning to attend a fair should avoid pigs and swine barns;
- avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Germs spread this way;
- avoid contact with pigs if you have flu-like symptoms;
- if you are sick, stay home from work or school until your illness is over;
- avoid close contact with sick people;
- cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze; throw the tissue in the trash after you use it and wash your hands;
- wash your hands often with soap and water; if soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

For more information on minimizing the transmission of illness at livestock exhibitions, visit the USDA website [https://www.usda.gov]. For more information on swine influenza, visit the CDC website at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/keyfacts_pigs.htm.

[2] California (San Luis Obispo county)

The California Department of Public Health (CDPH), in collaboration with the County of San Luis Obispo Public Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has confirmed variant influenza A (H1N2v) infections in 2 persons. The individuals were exposed to a pig at the California Mid-State Fair in Paso Robles, California that was infected with influenza. The individuals have recovered after experiencing brief illnesses.

Influenza viruses that are spread among pigs are occasionally transmitted to people who have close contact with pigs. When this happens, the infections in humans are called variant influenza virus infections. Variant influenza virus infections are usually mild, with symptoms similar to those of seasonal influenza. However, like seasonal influenza, serious illness is possible. Person-to-person transmission of variant influenza viruses is not common, and people cannot get it by eating pork.

In recent years, variant influenza virus infections have occurred each summer in the United States, and most infections have been linked to exposure to pigs at agricultural events. With the county [2018] fair season still in full swing in California, these cases of variant influenza virus infections serve as a reminder to take steps to prevent illness when visiting events where pigs and other animals are on exhibit.

"Visiting animals can be one of the highlights of the fair," said Dr] Karen Smith, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer. "It is important to remember to practice good hygiene when working with or visiting animals."

[...]

Persons who have influenza symptoms after recent contact with pigs should tell their healthcare provider about their exposure. Symptoms of influenza include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, and may also include vomiting or diarrhea. People at greater risk of serious influenza-related complications (children under 5, adults 65 and over, pregnant women, persons with a weakened immune system, or certain chronic medical conditions) should contact their healthcare provider as soon as possible. The same medications used to treat people with seasonal influenza can also be used for variant influenza virus infections.

If variant influenza is suspected in a patient, healthcare providers should contact their local health department to coordinate appropriate testing. For local health department contact information, visit CDPH's website.

This report actually confirms that the human cases of swine origin influenza earlier reported as suspected A/H3N2v [Influenza (23): USA (MI,CA) swine origin H3N2v, human, swine, fair 20180809.5953369] were in fact Influenza A (H1N2)v .

Novel influenza viruses can arise among humans either by direct transmission from mammalian or avian sources or through genetic reassortment. The segmented nature of the influenza viral genome allows reassortment to occur in a host that is simultaneously infected with >2 subtypes of influenza A viruses. Although influenza viruses exhibit some host specificity, swine are susceptible to infection with viruses of avian and mammalian lineages, facilitated by the presence of receptors for both lineages in the respiratory tract. Swine can therefore serve as "mixing vessels" for different lineages, providing an opportunity for novel reassortants to arise. The reassortant viruses may acquire mammalian adaption characteristics, thereby allowing infection of humans to occur [Webster RG, Bean WJ, Gorman OT, et al. Evolution and ecology of influenza A viruses. Microbiol Rev. 1992; 56(1): 152-79; http://mmbr.asm.org/content/56/1/152.full.pdf].

A(H1N2) viruses have been described among avian, swine, and human populations. Like A(H3N2) and A(H1N1) viruses, A(H1N2) viruses have become established in swine herds in many regions. During 2012, in addition to over 300 human cases of swine-origin influenza A(H3N2) variant (v) viruses, a lesser known swine-origin influenza subtype variant, A(H1N2)v, infected 4 persons attending agricultural shows during the final days of the agricultural show season (see PROMED-mail Influenza (85): United States of America (Minnesota) swine H1N2 Influenza, human cases 20120911.1290389). Although there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, there was concern that the presence of the matrix protein derived from the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, which had been circulating widely in the human population since 2009, could potentially confer the A(H1N2)v virus with increased transmissibility among humans.

The cases in the above report are among the first influenza A (H1N2)v virus infections identified in in 2018 in the United States. Since reporting of novel influenza A viruses began nationally in 2005, only 17 human infections of influenza A (H1N2)v (including the 2 Michigan cases) have been reported to CDC.

Studies at the animal-human interface are needed to determine seroprevalence, and active surveillance is needed to uncover infection rates to better determine the risk for zoonotic transmission of swine-origin H1N2 to human health. - Mod.UBA]
