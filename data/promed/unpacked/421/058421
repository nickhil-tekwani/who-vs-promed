New Aggressive Drug-resistant HIV Emerges in Vancouver
------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Julio Montaner, chair of AIDS research at St. Paul's Hospital and the
University of B.C., said doctors at St. Paul's have documented about a
half-dozen cases in the past year of newly infected people whose strain of
the virus is resistant to all 3 classes of anti-HIV drugs. It is common for
AIDS patients to develop a resistance to some of the drugs they are taking,
and 5 to 10 percent of new infections in the United States involve a form
of HIV resistant to some types of drugs used in treatment of AIDS (acquired
immune deficiency syndrome). But there have been only a handful of reported
cases in the world where a person was newly infected with a type of HIV
(human immunodeficiency virus) resistant to all 3 drug classes. In most of
those cases, it appeared that in becoming drug-resistant, the virus that
causes AIDS had mutated in a way that made it less effective and less
dangerous.
In an interview on Wed 8 Aug 2001, Montaner said researchers at St. Paul's
have recently treated 2 patients with multi-drug resistant HIV whose virus
spread faster than normal. In both cases, Montaner said, the patients (who
are still alive) contracted the virus from their partners. Montaner stated
that it is possible similar viruses are already spreading in Vancouver --
raising fears of a new epidemic of [multi-drug resistant] AIDS.
Drug cocktail therapies usually involve taking 2 of the 3 classes of AIDS
drugs at once. So someone who becomes resistant to one class of drug still
has "a backup," Montaner said. But someone who is resistant to 2 or 3 drug
classes has far fewer options. The spread of drug-resistant HIV has led
some researchers, including those at St. Paul's, to develop so-called
"salvage therapies" that involve bombarding patients with dozens [this
seems unlikely - Man. Ed. DS] of different types of drugs to try to
suppress the HIV in their system and then move them to more stable
therapies. Montaner argues that urgent measures need to be taken now to
avoid something similar happening with AIDS, which could begin to erase the
gains against the disease made over the past 7 years. "If we are not able
to come up with a strategy that avoids [drug-resistant HIV perpetuating]
itself . . . we may be creating a scenario that you can currently see with
multi-drug resistant tuberculosis," Montaner said.
In an editorial in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine
[entitled "Antiretroviral therapy for previously treated patients," NEJM
345(6):452-2], Montaner, along with Dr. John Mellors of the University of
Pittsburgh, argues that regulators and pharmaceutical companies need to be
more flexible in allowing experimental drugs to be used on patients with
drug-resistant HIV. At present, new drugs are usually tested on patients
only along with existing, approved drugs. This is done to measure the
effectiveness of a single new medicine properly and to ensure patients
aren't put at risk by being put on several unproven drugs at once. People
with drug-resistant HIV often do become healthier when treated with new
drugs, Montaner said. "But the benefit is transient" -- with the virus
usually returning in time. To have any hope of tackling drug-resistant HIV
in the long-term, Montaner said, drug-resistant patients need to be treated
with several new experimental drugs at once to suppress the virus. Such a
change in approach requires the cooperation of drug companies and
government regulators, Montaner said, to strike a balance between rigorous
scientific testing and getting new drugs to desperate patients. "There has
to be a recognition that the single most important challenge we're facing
today is people that have a drug-resistant virus," Montaner said. "What
we're trying to do is ring a bit of an alarm".

[ProMED-mail does not routinely cover HIV and AIDS, but the emergence of
multi-drug resistant HIV in newly diagnosed patients presents a new
challenge. It is not entirely clear from this report, however, whether the
virus isolated in Vancouver is a more aggressive strain than those that
have appeared elsewhere. An informed comment would be welcome. - Mod.CP]
