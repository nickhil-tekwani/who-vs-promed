The following is the entire report of the OIE's Disease Information report
of 3 July 1998:
Text of a fax received on 1 July 1998 from Dr J. Ladan, Director of the
Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services, Federal Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, Abuja:
End of previous report period: 31 December 1997 (see Disease Information,
11 [22], 79, dated 5 June 1998).
End of this report period: 18 June 1998.
Location of the outbreaks: States of Lagos and Ogun (south-western Nigeria).
Description of affected population: in Lagos State about 3,000 pigs died,
while the number of deaths in Ogun State was 12,000. The mortality rate in
these States was between 85% and 100%.
Diagnosis: the diagnosis has yet to be confirmed in the laboratory, but
based on symptoms and other clinical signs and the known epidemiology of
the disease, including the very high mortality rate, this disease is
believed to be African swine fever.
Epidemiology: the initial outbreak was detected in September 1997 in
villages in the Badagri, Ipokia and Abeokuta Local Government Areas. It is
believed to be an extension of an earlier disease outbreak from a
neighbouring country.
Control measures during reporting period: control measures adopted include
slaughter and restrictions on the movement of pigs and pig meat products
throughout the country. The early recognition of the outbreak facilitated
restriction of movement both at the
inter-State level and at international borders. A nation-wide control
programme is being organised with the support of the FAO (Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations).
