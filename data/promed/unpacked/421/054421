Williamson County Health District employees have a warning for
parents. They've confirmed that a bat found Monday [7 Apr 2008] at
the Twin Lakes YMCA daycare playground has tested positive for rabies.

They say at least 2 children came in contact with that bat before it
was quarantined and suspect there could be more.

Cedar Park Animal Control and Williamson County Health District have
notified the staff of the Twin Lakes YMCA who began to notify parents
who might have had children at their facility that day. Police are
asking that if your child attended that day-care on Monday [7 Apr
2008], contact the Williamson County Health District or your doctor.
