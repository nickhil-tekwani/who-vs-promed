There has been an outbreak of equine viral arteritis (EVA), a serious viral disease in horses, in Dorset.

The UK's Chief Veterinary Officer confirmed today (5 Apr 2019) that 2 cases of EVA in non-thoroughbred stallions have been discovered on a premises in the county.

Although deaths from EVA are very rare in healthy adults, pregnant mares that become infected may abort, and very young foals may die from a form of pneumonia as a result of it.

Humans can spread the disease mechanically, but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs [DEFRA] has said there is no risk to public health, as the virus is not harmful to humans.

Restrictions on breeding have been put in place on the animals to limit the risk of the disease spreading, and further investigations are ongoing.

Upcoming horse racing events should not be affected as the infected animals are not racehorses.

Chief Veterinary Officer Christine Middlemiss said: "We have taken swift action to limit the risk of the disease spreading by restricting the movement of the animals and their semen. A full investigation is underway to determine the source and possible spread of the infection. Owners of mares and stallions are urged to have their animals tested before they are used for breeding. These findings remind us that we must all be vigilant for signs of disease and follow strict biosecurity measures."

Signs of EVA can include:

- Abortions
- Depression
- Conjunctivitis
- Swelling of testicles or udder, also around eyes and lower legs
- Fever and runny nose
- Lethargy and stiff movement
- Some infected horses will show no clinical signs.

You can help prevent the disease spreading by:

Vaccinating stallions against the disease; talk to your vet for advice.
Practising good biosecurity on your premises;
Owners of mares and stallions are urged to have their animals tested before they are used for breeding;
If you suspect EVA, please get in touch with the Animal and Plant Health Agency at <enquiries@apha.gov.uk>.

To have your horse tested on a precautionary basis, contact your private vet and have your animal tested at an accredited laboratory.

EVA is not the same as equine influenza, the horse-based flu virus that halted horse racing events across the country earlier this year [2019].

[The mentioned EVA event was officially reported to the OIE by UK's CVO on Thu 4 Apr 2019; the notification, including a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30056. The report indicates that the affected holding includes 35 "susceptible" horses, of which 2 were reported as "cases," and includes the following comment on the affected population:

"Following a non-negative lab result for equine viral arteritis (EVA) antibodies and a lack of vaccine history against EVA, a number of stallions on the premises were investigated for the possibility of EVA. The stallions were showing no signs of clinical disease. Official breeding restrictions have been placed on all suspect and confirmed stallions. Semen samples taken from 2 stallions are positive for EVA on 2 different PCR tests. Ongoing epidemiological investigations as to the extent of disease spread is currently underway. Breeding restrictions are maintained on affected stallions and semen until risk can be eliminated."

Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus classified in the genus _Arterivirus_, family Arteriviridae. Equine arteritis virus is found in horse populations in many countries worldwide.

Further information, particularly in reference to EVA's etiology, diagnostic tests and vaccine requirements, is available in OIE's terrestrial manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.05.10_EVA.pdf. - Mod.AS
