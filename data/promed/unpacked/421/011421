The suspected encephalitis death toll in Bihar [State]'s Muzaffarpur district is increasing by the day, and according to the latest report, 107 children have died in the last 2 months.

Now, the outbreak is spreading to some of the adjoining districts. A 3-year-old child, from Bihar's Sheohar district, has been at a government hospital in Muzaffarpur for over 2 days now, brought in with the familiar symptoms of fever, shivering and body ache, that affects hundreds of children in these parts each year, and has resulted in many deaths from what doctors suspect is acute encephalitis.

But over 2 decades after this disease hit Muzaffarpur, no cause or cure has been found yet.

The Bihar government says it has provided an ambulance at each block office within Muzaffarpur so that children exhibiting any of the symptoms can be rushed to the designated hospitals. Currently, 2 hospitals in Muzaffarpur, one government and one private children's hospital, have the required facilities and treatment available. However, a dedicated encephalitis ward at the government hospital has not been set up, but authorities says it will be created soon.

Last week [week of 9 Jun 2014], the Union Health Minister announced a series of measures to tackle encephalitis, including a bigger effort to identify the cause of the disease and a 5-year action plan similar to the one implemented for polio.

[The number of fatal encephalitis cases reported continues to climb. On 16 Jun 2014, the count was 92 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140616.2544699), and now has climbed to 107 just 2 days later. One hopes that the Union Health Minister will intensify the effort to determine the etiology of these cases, which have been occurring for many years.
