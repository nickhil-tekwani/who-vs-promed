[1] WHO update
Date: 4 Sep 2014 [as of 31 Aug 2014]
Source: WHO Disease outbreak news [edited]
http://who.int/csr/don/2014_09_04_ebola/en


Recognizing the demand for updated numbers from this outbreak, the following information is being released in advance of the 2nd update of this situation report.

As of 31 Aug 2014, 3685 (probable, confirmed and suspected) cases and 1841 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak of Ebola virus disease by the Ministries of Health of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone [about 600 new cases and 300 more deaths, or 100 new cases per day in the 5-6 days since the last WHO update (dated 28 Aug 2014 with data as of 26 Aug 2014). Note that the media tend to note the release date rather than the "as of" date. - Mod.JW].

- Nigeria, 21 cases and 7 deaths
- Senegal, one case has been confirmed, and there have been no EVD deaths or further suspected cases.

Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by ministries of health. These numbers are subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation and availability of laboratory results; widespread and intense transmission as of 31 Aug 2014.

[Table with detailed country data here]

Note: A separate outbreak of Ebola virus disease, which is not related to the outbreak in west Africa, was laboratory-confirmed on 26 Aug 2014 by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Information on this outbreak is provided in separate editions of the Disease Outbreak News [and in a separate ProMED thread: EVD - Central Africa].

[WHO, in its latest report issued on Fri 5 Sep 2014 afternoon, said the total number of EVD cases now stands at 3944 and deaths recorded at 1759 in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, countries identified as "those with widespread and intense transmission". The fatality rate is 53 per cent. It ranges from 39 per cent in Sierra Leone to 64 per cent in Guinea. - Mod.JW]

[2] WHO detailed situation report 5 Sep 2014
Date: 5 Sep 2014
Source: WHO [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/5-september-2014-en.pdf


[This full of useful maps, charts and graphs. Excerpts follow...]

The outbreak continues to expand geographically. For the 1st time since the outbreak began, the majority of cases (55.3 per cent) have been reported outside Gueckedou and Macenta (Guinea); Lofa (Liberia), and Kenema and Kailahun (Sierra Leone); 3 districts in Guinea have been affected for the 1st time.

The outbreak continues to escalate. Most cases are concentrated in only a few places: more than 80 per cent of cases have occurred in 9 out of the 42 districts in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that have reported cases... The overall case fatality rate (ratio of deaths to cases) is 53 per cent. It ranges from 39 per cent in Sierra Leone to 64 per cent in Guinea.

There are still critical shortages of EVD treatment beds in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, the 3 countries that have intense and widespread transmission. In the past week, an additional 40 beds have been established by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Monrovia; a further 40 beds will soon be available in Bong, Liberia. Total EVD Treatment Centre bed capacity for these 3 countries are: Guinea, 130; Liberia, 314; and Sierra Leone, 130. Another 170 beds are expected to be available soon in Sierra Leone.

Based on current capacity and needs, an additional 980*** EVD treatment centre beds are required, with 760 of these in Monrovia alone. [ProMED-mail emphasis]

In Nigeria, contact tracing is under way, with more than 400 contacts being followed in both Lagos and Port Harcourt; 3 cases are currently in isolation. All cases and contacts can be traced back to the initial case.

In Senegal, the identified case is currently in isolation, with 67 contacts being followed.

[3] UN press conference: 3 key points
Date: 3 Sep 2014
Source: UN [edited]
http://unfoundationblog.org/un-press-conference-3-key-points-on-the-response-to-ebola


On Wed [3 Sep 2014], senior leaders from the United Nations updated media on the response by the UN and its agencies to the EVD crisis, which has caused about 1900 deaths in West Africa. Dr Margaret Chan, director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr David Nabarro, senior UN system coordinator for Ebola [virus] disease, and Dr Keiji Fukuda, WHO's assistant director-general for health security provided information on WHO's Ebola [Virus Disease] Response Roadmap and what needs to be done to bring the outbreak under control and save lives.

Here are 3 key points on the response:

1. This is a complex, multi-faceted challenge that requires a robust response. Dr Chan began the press conference by noting that this outbreak is the largest, most complex, and most severe in EVD's history. To respond, affected countries need
- more trucks and motorcycles to transport patients,
- more beds to host them,
- more protective materials and equipment,
- and particularly, more health care workers to treat patients.

In addition, steps need to be taken to strengthen the economies and primary health care systems in countries where they are strained because of EVD.

2. The EVD crisis is a global problem that requires a global solution. In our connected world, disease outbreaks don't stop at borders. The countries affected by EVD are leading the response to contain the outbreak, but the international community must step up its efforts to support them now. Additional technical expertise and resources are desperately needed. The price tag for the response is estimated to cost USD 600 million and may go higher.

In addition, we need to make sure EVD patients and EVD-affected countries aren't stigmatized and isolated. Measures like stopping flights to and from countries with widespread transmission are counterproductive, making it hard for aid [including aid workers] to get to where it's needed.

3. The EVD outbreak can be stopped, but the response must be urgently scaled up. UN leaders believe EVD can be stopped, and the roadmap released by WHO aims to stop transmission in 6-9 months. But the international community must act now to increase the global response. As Dr. Nabarro said, we can't afford to lose a day.

[4] African Union to deploy humanitarian mission
Date: 3 Sep 2014

http://allafrica.com/stories/201409031603.html


In an unprecedented step, the 1st of its kind in the history of the African Union (AU), the Peace and Security Council (PSC) has decided to deploy a humanitarian mission to help end the outbreak of the deadly ebolavirus, ... mandating "the immediate deployment of an AU-led military and civilian humanitarian mission, comprising medical doctors, nurses and other medical and paramedical personnel, as well as military personnel, as required for the effectiveness and protection of the mission." ...

[5] Call for leadership
Date: 4 Sep 2014
Source: Washington Post editorial [excerpted, edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-the-ebola-crisis-demands-americas-involvement/2014/09/03/d517a9b4-3391-11e4-8f02-03c644b2d7d0_story.html


We are about to witness a human catastrophe that could destroy large portions of a continent and pose a global threat. And the response of the world, including the USA, is feeble, irresponsible and disrespectful of nature's lethal perils. ...

Once the growth of an outbreak becomes exponential, the tools normally at the disposal of health officials have limited value. It may require military airlifts just to deliver sufficient rubber gloves, aprons, soap and buckets to highly affected areas. Doctors Without Borders [MSF] is calling for the deployment of civilian and military medical teams to provide triage centers, field hospitals with isolation wards, mobile diagnostic labs and systems for the management of corpses. But who will direct and implement such an effort? The WHO is not an emergency response organization. ... The United Nations has no epidemic response force comparable to its peacekeeping operations (though perhaps it should). It is hard to imagine a coordinated effort on a sufficient scale that is not organized by the USA. ...

This is what should be happening: The White House should be instructing officials at the US Agency for International Development [USAID], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], and the National Institutes of Health [NIH] to come up with an ambitious plan on a blank chalkboard. The Office of Management and Budget [OMB] should be approaching House Republican leaders with a proposal to fund that plan, and the White House should be cultivating congressional champions for the measure. A continuing resolution to fund the government will be put together this month [September 2014]. If the Obama administration does not act quickly, it will lose its best chance at securing resources until December [2014]. But, so far, there is no ambitious plan. The OMB has not indicated it will ask for additional resources. ...

Health officials are near their wit's end. "I don't see any pathway that is easy to implement," one told me. Easy or hard, it is time for the United States to blaze a path out of this valley of death.

[6] Liberia: doctor evacuated to USA

3 Sep 2014: (Times Free Press) The 3rd US aid worker sickened with EVD is a Boston-area doctor who decided to return to Liberia after the 2 other [Americans] fell ill with the deadly virus, the president of his missionary group said Wed [3 Sep 2014]. Dr Rick Sacra went back to Liberia about a month ago and was not caring for EVD patients, instead delivering babies at the missionary group's hospital in Liberia, Serving in Mission (SIM) president Bruce Johnson said at a news conference. Sacra followed all protocols to protect himself. ...

4 Sep 2014: (UNMC) The US State Department has asked for assistance from the Nebraska Medical Center and the University of Nebraska Medical Center in caring for an American doctor who was working in West Africa when he tested positive for ebolavirus.

Officials expect this patient to arrive in Omaha on Friday morning [5 Sep 2014] and to begin treatment in the Biocontainment Patient Care Unit located inside The Nebraska Medical Center. ...
[by: Taylor Wilson, Nebraska Medical Center; http://www.unmc.edu/news.cfm?match=15636]

3 Sep 2014: (Macleans) Experts say any fully-equipped hospital that follows the latest safety protocols could prevent a US outbreak while caring for an EVD patient, but there are 4 high-level isolation units in the USA designed especially to handle dreaded infectious diseases. The largest of the 4, with 10 beds, is at the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Hospital officials there have been told to be ready to receive a patient. The 2 Americans were previously evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and survived. The other 2 units are National Institutes of Health facilities in Maryland and Montana. http://www.macleans.ca/news/world/hospital-staff-lacking-protections-in-liberia-are-often-exposed-to-ebola [excerpted]

["As Dr Nabarro said, we can't afford to lose a day." (UN press conference, above). Not now, with an average of 100 new cases and 50 deaths every day.

The case count passed the
- 1000 mark on 17 Jul 2014,
- 2000 mark on 13 Aug 2014 and
- 3000 mark on 26 Aug 2014.

In other words, it took 4 weeks for the 2nd 1000 cases to appear, but only 2 weeks for the next 1000. It's accelerating.

Plus, who knows how many are dying from other causes because they are frightened of going to hospital, or like one Indian missionary, for being turned away for lack of hospital floor space? WHO estimates 980 EVD treatment centre beds are required, with 760 of them in Monrovia alone.

Also, one estimate is that up to 4 times as many EVD sick are being cared for in homes and buried secretly from there. Given the need for 700 more EVD treatment beds in Monrovia, and the fall-off in trade by sea to its port, could not an empty warehouse be cleaned up and converted into a giant ward, as was done during the 1918-1919 Spanish flu epidemic in Europe?
