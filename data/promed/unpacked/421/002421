Killer disease ravages polo
---------------------------
2007 will for long be remembered by the equestrian community in Nigeria as
the year the king of sports, polo, was shaken to its very foundation.
Never, in the over-a-century-old history of the noble sport, has the game
been so threatened than now.
As you are reading this piece, the Nigerian pony population is facing a
cruel extinction, if the ravaging disease, equine herpesvirus (EHV), which
is killing horses within days of infection, is not curtailed.
The disease, which, according to the polo fraternity, was 1st noticed in
Kano, had within weeks spread to Kaduna late last year [2006], wreaking
havoc in many stables.
But the worst hit is Lagos, where close to 40 expensive Argentine and other
local breed horses have been wiped out in the last one week, throwing the
ever-bustling club into serious crisis, as polo players and their grooms
watch in horror as their prized ponies die on a daily basis.
Lagos Polo Club captain Francis Ogboro, who confirmed the outbreak of the
disease, said the death toll was mounting by the day, as almost every pony
at the Ribadu Road Club was affected. The virus, said to be transmitted by
flies, ensures that no stable is spared the horror. "Nobody is spared by
this calamity. Personally, I have lost some horses, and so it is to every
other playing member who has a stable within the club premises," the
captain added. He told Sunpolo that efforts to curtail the spread of the
disease were in full swing, as the whole polo complex has been quarantined.
A veterinary doctor from South Africa was flown into the country, while an
order for vaccine worth over NGN 3 million [USD 23 457] has been placed by
the club, as the "big boys" battle to save the lives of their depleted
stables and the game they all love with passion.
A worried polo patron, Mallam Ahmed Dasuki, who also lost a horse to the
disease, is urging the Nigerian Polo Association (NPA) to help curtail the
disease by working with the necessary authorities in the Federal Ministry
of Health to procure vaccines, and also, to put the necessary legislation
in force to guard against future outbreaks of epidemics like this.
Apart from the dwindling stock of polo ponies in Lagos, the rampaging
disease, said to have affected horses in other far flung areas like Yola
and Katsina, has taken its toll on the Lagos International Polo Tournament,
which has been called off. Also canceled this year [2007], is the Ibadan
Polo Tournament.
The just concluded Port Harcourt Polo Festival was not spared by the killer
disease, as affected clubs like Kano, Ibadan, and Lagos withdrew their
teams, 24 hours to the festival's kick off time. In what looks like a
global outbreak of horse diseases, the wider equestrian community in
Wellington has questioned the actions of state authorities in the
containment of the outbreak of EHV, which is deadly to horses.
It's believed that information and advice had not been distributed widely
enough, and strict restriction on the movement of horses has not been given
serious consideration. One major problem is ensuring that information is
passed on to the huge Spanish-speaking population of grooms who work in the
area.
The virus has killed many horses in the United States and left many others
in quarantine. Meanwhile, Palm Beach Polo Club [in Florida, USA] is
continuing preparations for the start of its 2007 high-goal season, despite
the current EHV outbreak in South Florida.
"We're constantly monitoring the EHV situation in Wellington," says the
club's manager. "The safety of the horses is everyone's primary concern.
"We're confident that this crisis will be over soon, so we are continuing
with our preparations."
Seven teams have already entered for the 22-goal Joe Barry Memorial Cup,
but at least one team may yet drop out since its ponies have not been able
to get sufficient training and exercise. Most teams have private facilities
in Wellington, Florida, which had allowed exercises and training to carry
on as usual. All horses due to play at IPCPB are required to have
injections 7-90 days before playing at the club.
The club is keeping the 20 plus teams expected to take part in the 2007
high-goal season at IPCPB (many of which have not yet arrived in
Wellington) informed of developments, stressing that the most important
thing is to contain the virus and make sure that the emergency subsides.

[The polo pony world is a small world, and certainly what affects one club
or area, such as Florida is well known in other portions of the world.
This article mentions legislative action to prevent epidemics of the
disease. Certainly, we would all like to see the disease prevented, but in
all likelihood legislative action will not prevent the disease but rather
may prevent the spread of the disease. The more cases we post of EHV would
certainly suggest that this should be a reportable disease, which would
facilitate more knowledge and perhaps quicker quarantines to limit
movements and hopefully decrease the impact of the disease.
Realizing that the disease has a 2-10 day incubation period, regulations
and testing are difficult, as an animal may test negative and within a few
days present with the disease. Certainly, this highlights a need for more
sensitive testing methods.
Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral disease
(EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe respiratory
infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease or abortion in
pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The immunity inferred from the
disease or the vaccine are relatively short. Horses on the show or racing
circuit are often vaccinated every 6 months.
EHV1 diagnostics are discussed in ProMED-mail posting 20030412.0885. A map
