More than 680 people in Ethiopia have died in a suspected cholera
outbreak that has also affected neighboring countries, officials said
Wed 21 Feb 2007. Some 60 000 people have been infected, but the
country's Health Ministry is resisting pressure to declare an
emergency despite a UN warning that the disease is an epidemic.
"The fact that it is spreading to new areas in the country is cause
for serious concern," said Paul Hebert, head of the UN's Office for
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Ethiopia. "The full
extent of this needs to be addressed."
The UN has not officially declared the outbreak, which began nearly a
year ago, to be cholera. But UN officials speaking privately because
of the sensitivity of the issue are saying it is cholera, something
local officials continue to deny.
Eight of Ethiopia's 11 regions have already been affected by the
outbreak, according to Ethiopia's Health Ministry and the UN. The
remote eastern region of Afar has recorded more than 1000 new cases
in the last week alone. The outbreak started in April 2006 after
heavy rains in the country.
"Once a disease has been present for an extended period of time, then
the likelihood of it being eliminated is quite difficult," Hebert
said. "I don't think we are addressing this issue on the scale that
is needed and it needs to be targeted to have an impact."
Ethiopian health officials, who say the disease is not cholera, are
describing the outbreak as acute watery diarrhea, but they have not
shared any of the test results that they have carried out.
The UN in Ethiopia has said the disease is suspected of having
entered Ethiopia from Sudan in 2006, where the disease was confirmed
in early 2006.
UN officials in Ethiopia are unable to act on their own about the
issue and are obligated to follow the lead of the country's Ministry
of Health. Only after a disease has been recorded as active in an
area for one year, can the WHO declare an emergency and label the
disease as endemic to the country.
Fears are mounting that with the onset of next month's [March 2007]
rainy season the outbreak could worsen. "The rainy season is coming
soon so it might get worse if we do not do something soon," said Dr.
Patrick Mweki, head of the International Medical Corps in Somalia.

[2] Cholera - Sierra Leone (Northern Province)
Date: Tue 20 Feb 2007

The Tonkolili District Health Management Team in collaboration with
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Holland have successfully treated over
190 cases of watery diarrhea and vomiting described to be "suspected
cases of cholera", at the Magburaka Government hospital with only 2
deaths due to the victims arriving too late for treatment.
The suspected cases mostly within Magburaka town and its immediate
environs in the Kholifa Rowala Chiefdom affect about 30 towns and
villages including Magbas in the Tonkolili district, and Rogberay,
Masati, and Massabah in the Bombalili district.
According to the District Medical Officer of Tonkolili and the MSF
Medical Officer, Dr. Susan Reveira, the 2 fatal cases encountered
arrived very late in a dehydrated condition and died few minutes
later [despite] efforts to save their lives.
In an interview with Jonathan Abass Kamara, Public Relations Officer
at the Ministry of Health, during a visit to the erected isolated
wards in the Magburaka Hospital compound, it was revealed that the
outbreak was the result of poor sources of drinking water as most
people drink from the Rokel river and other outlets. The Magbass
Sugar Complex Sewage System running into the river source was also
[identified as] another major source of contamination of the water
the people use for domestic purposes. A good number of the Magbass
workers are said to be infected.
Towns and villages affected include Magburaka, Makeni-Lol, Makaloh,
Magbas Makari-Kabia, Makaprie, Mabum, Masoko, Mabone, Masobinta,
Mafumba, Magbonto, Magbesseh, Mamuta, Rotchen, Masegble, Masampa,
Robiz, and Tongbai. Meanwhile, samples of stool collected have been
sent to Freetown to establish whether it is cholera.

According to figures from the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), 82 people have died in a cholera epidemic in the Republic
of Congo. The outbreak was officially declared at the end of January
2007, in Pointe-Noire, the economic heart of the Congo located in the
southwest [of the country], and has since spread to the capital, Brazzaville.
Figures released by UNICEF Mon 19 Feb 2007, compiled from data from
local health authorities, found that 4077 people in Pointe-Noire had
contracted cholera by 14 Feb 2007, of whom 61 died.
North of the town, in the Kouilou area, 106 people have been recorded
with cholera, of whom 7 died, and in Brazzaville, 14 people have
died, and a further 46 have been infected, UNICEF said.
Although the number of new cases has [decreased] markedly in
Pointe-Noire and Brazzaville in the last few days, UNICEF warned that
the disease had appeared in the Mindouli area, between the 2 towns.
"Despite a fall in the fatalities, which shows the good performance
of the care of those (infected) cases, it is important to note that
the epidemic continues to develop in terms of the number of new
registered cases," UNICEF said in its last report on the progress of
the disease.

[4] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Harare)

Cholera has killed 3 people in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, in the 1st
recorded deaths from the disease in 2007, the official Sunday Mail
newspaper reported. The 3, who include a 75-year-old woman, were all
residents of Epworth, an impoverished shantytown to the south of Harare.
Zimbabwean Health Minister, David Parirenyatwa, said his ministry was
"on high alert" to deal with the outbreak, which he blamed on poor
water supply to the area. "The 3 are the only cases we have received
so far, as the ministry is in control of the situation," Parirenyatwa
said, according to the newspaper. Earlier in February 2007, Harare
authorities worked to contain an outbreak in 2 townships where
residents had been collecting water from unprotected wells. At least
19 people were reported to have contracted cholera in that outbreak,
but there were no recorded deaths.
A 6-year economic and political crisis in Zimbabwe has taken its toll
on public health facilities, sanitation systems, and water provision
in Harare and other major towns and cities, leaving residents exposed
to the threat of cholera and other diseases linked to poor hygiene.
In many suburbs, garbage goes uncollected for weeks because
authorities have no fuel to power waste collection, while sewage
flows freely from broken pipes the authorities say they have no money to fix.
A cholera outbreak in Harare's Glen View township killed 3 people in
January 2006, forcing the authorities to temporarily shut down the
capital's main food and vegetable market.
