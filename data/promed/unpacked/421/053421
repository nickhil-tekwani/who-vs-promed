Breastfed baby exposed to smallpox vaccine virus
------------------------------------------------
Breastfeeding women who live with someone who has been recently vaccinated
against smallpox should take extra precautions to prevent their infants
from being exposed to the virus used in the vaccine, according to a new
report [Garde V, Harper D, Fairchok MP. Tertiary contact vaccinia in a
breastfeeding infant. JAMA 2004; 291: 725-7, 11 Feb 2004
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/291/6/725>]. Doctors at the
Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma, Washington, have documented the case
of a breastfed infant who was exposed to vaccinia virus, which is used as
the smallpox vaccine.
The baby's mother had not been vaccinated against smallpox but her husband,
a soldier, was given the vaccine soon before the baby developed symptoms.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) already recommends
that women who are breastfeeding should not receive the smallpox vaccine,
but there are no guidelines against vaccination of other people living in
the same household.
Transfer of the vaccinia virus within a household remains "extremely rare,"
according to Dr Mary P Fairchok, but she said this case demonstrates the
need for extra precautions in households where a child is breastfeeding.
About 10 days after the husband was inoculated, his wife developed blisters
on her nipples. Shortly after, a blister was seen on the baby's upper lip.
Testing showed that vaccinia virus was the cause of the lesions for both
the mother and the child.
"This case showed us that breastfeeding women living with vaccine
recipients should be very careful about possible contact," Fairchok told
Reuters Health. "They should always wash their hands prior to nursing,
probably not do the laundry of the vaccine recipient, and potentially not
sleep in the same bed or have other intimate contact until after the
vaccine scab has fallen off," Fairchok said. If a breastfeeding woman who
lives with a recently vaccinated person develops painful sores on her
breasts, Fairchok said, she should hold off on breastfeeding until seeing a
health care provider to make sure that the sores are not due to infection
with the vaccine virus.
The Washington physician noted that the infant in the report recovered
well, but she could have ended up with scarring or, if the infection had
spread to her eyes, with vision loss. After being monitored in the hospital
for 12 days, the child was discharged.
Vaccinia virus is related to smallpox virus and produces immunity to
smallpox. Smallpox vaccination can cause severe side effects, including
brain damage and even death, in a small percentage of people, particularly
children and people with weakened immune systems. But even if individuals
who are at high risk of side effects are not given the vaccine, there are
fears that they might be infected by vaccinia virus that is shed by others
during the weeks after vaccination. "The vaccine has been on the whole very
safe, with very few accidental household transfers," Fairchok said, but
taking a few precautions may minimize the small risk that a child will
become infected.
The parents of the baby who was exposed to vaccinia virus seemed to take
all the appropriate steps to prevent transmission of the virus. After being
vaccinated in early May 2003, the baby's father reported following all
precautions to prevent the spread of vaccinia virus, including keeping the
vaccination site covered. However, the wife did do all of the family's
laundry, so she could have been exposed through contact with infected
clothes, towels, or bed linens Based on this case, Fairchok and her
colleagues advise that the CDC amend its guidelines to recommend that
vaccine recipients not share a bed with a breastfeeding mother and that
they do their own laundry. Also, women who are breastfeeding should be
reminded to always wash their hands before nursing, the authors of the
report recommend.
