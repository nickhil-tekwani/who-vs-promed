---------------------------------------------------------------------
A pospiviroid, detected from asymptomatic potato plants (_Solanum tuberosum_) from Russia, was identified as chrysanthemum stunt viroid (CSVd). The genomic sequence of this potato isolate showed 100% identity with that of the chrysanthemum isolates from Japan.

The CSVd RNA transcribed from the cDNA, having the sequence of the isolate from Russia, was able to infect potato, tomato, and chrysanthemum plants. The infected chrysanthemum plants exhibited stunting symptom.

This is the 1st report of the occurrence of CSVd in Russia, its natural infection of potato plants and the potential spread of CSVd through propagation of infected potato.

[_Chrysanthemum stunt viroid_ (CSVd) is a member of genus _Pospiviroid_, type member _Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd). The group also includes other important crop pathogens mainly affecting solanaceous crops and citrus.

Pospiviroids can be spread with vegetative propagation material (tubers, cuttings, transplants, tissue cultures), pollen, mechanical means (including insect and human activities) and plant-to-plant contact. They have been shown to be seed transmitted in crop and wild Solanaceae, for example PSTVd in potato and tomato at a rate of up to 100 per cent. Thus, with seeds being traded widely, they are considered an important international quarantine risk (ProMED-mail posts 20140122.2222560 and 20130321.1597703).

The viroids are exceptionally stable and can survive in sap or leaf litter for considerable times. Disease management relies mainly on removal of infected plants and other possible sources of inoculum, as well as use of certified viroid free planting material. The presence of pospiviroids in a number of symptomless reservoir hosts has been reported from several countries (see ProMED-mail posts below) and poses a threat to crops. This highlights the importance of systematic surveys and quarantine measures for these pathogens, even if there are no obvious problems with crops.

PSTVd is known to occur widely in Russia, due to suspected distribution of infected tissue cultures from central national facilities (ProMED-mail posts 20190606.6506616 and 20070423.1323). The above as a 1st report of CSVd in the country is also significant for CSVd epidemiology: a few solanaceous species have been described as susceptible experimental hosts for this viroid, but the detection in potato as a new natural host has important implications for seed tuber certification and international biosecurity.
