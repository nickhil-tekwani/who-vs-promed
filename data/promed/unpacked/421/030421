Baby formula sickened many more, China says
-------------------------------------------
China's health minister on Wednesday [17 Sep 2008] reported a 3rd
death from contaminated baby formula and said more than 1300 babies
remained hospitalized, including 158 for acute kidney failure, in
what has become a rapidly widening food safety scandal.

The minister, Chen Zhu, presented the figures just a day after the
government said a dangerous chemical additive had been discovered in
samples of infant milk powder produced by 22 Chinese dairy companies.
Before that disclosure, officials had focused their investigation on
a single company, the Sanlu Group, which has acknowledged producing
formula powder laced with the additive, melamine.

At a news conference Wednesday morning [17 Sep 2008] carried on
national television, Mr Chen said that in total 6244 babies had been
sickened so far by the tainted powdered formula. Most of the children
had recovered.

On Tuesday [16 Sep 2008], China Central Television, the state-run
network, reported that an inspection of 175 dairy companies had found
traces of melamine in some batches of baby formula at 22 of them,
including Sanlu.

Dairy companies quickly began recalling products, including the
country's largest dairy operation, Mengniu. At the same time, the
government has sent more investigators to inspect dairy companies
across the country.

The scandal is especially charged politically because government
officials pledged to reform food safety regulation after a spate of
problems last year [2007]. In one highly publicized case, thousands
of pets in the United States were sickened by pet food made with a
Chinese ingredient tainted with melamine (see prior ProMED-mail
references below available at <http://www.promedmail.org> - Mod.MPP].

Melamine is an industrial chemical used to make plastics and
fertilizer. But in the past, Chinese farmers have admitted using the
chemical to artificially inflate protein levels in feed or other
agricultural products.

Infants sickened by the tainted formula have developed kidney stones
and other ailments. On Monday [15 Sep 2008], less than a week after
the 1st disclosures about the bad formula, the Ministry of Health
announced the 2nd infant death and said that 1253 babies had been
sickened over all, including 53 still hospitalized in serious
condition. The revised figures on Wednesday [17 Sep 2008] included
6244 babies sickened.

The 3rd death was reported in Zhejiang Province; the earlier ones
were in Gansu Province.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong authorities announced Tuesday [16 Sep 2008] that
traces of melamine had been discovered in frozen yogurt made by the
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group. In response, the Hong Kong
supermarket chain Wellcome announced that it would stop selling
frozen yogurt made by the company, according to news agency reports.

Public anger seems to be rising. This week, parents of sickened
children have congregated outside the Sanlu Group corporate
headquarters in the city of Shijiazhuang, in Hebei Province.

China News Agency, a government service, reported that the company's
chairwoman, Tian Wenhua, stepped down Tuesday [16 Sep 2008]. The
company has blamed suppliers for providing tainted milk.

Chinese officials have blamed the company for failing to come forward
about the problem. Parents with sick children began complaining as
far back as March [2008], and Fonterra, a New Zealand dairy
corporation that owns a large minority stake in Sanlu, said it
learned of the problems in August [2008] and tried to prod Sanlu into
making a public recall. Sanlu did not do so until state media
reported the problems last week [week of 8 Sep 2008].

The police have announced the arrest of 2 more suspects, a farmer and
a milk dealer in Hebei Province. Earlier, 2 brothers who worked as
milk dealers in Hebei were arrested.

Dairy farming is a rapidly expanding business and competition is
fierce. Some dealers have admitted to diluting milk with water, but
doing so lowers protein levels. As a result, melamine, rich in
nitrogen, is sometimes used to artificially inflate those levels.

Most companies' baby milk powder safe in China, says State Council
------------------------------------------------------------------
The infant milk powder produced by most companies in China was safe
according to the nationwide check results following the Sanlu baby
formula scam, the country's State Council departments said on Tuesday
[17 Sep 2008].

The State Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine said it had tested 491 batches of baby milk powder
produced by all the 109 companies in the country in a special inspection move.

A total of 69 batches from 22 companies nationwide were found
containing melamine, a chemical which had tainted Sanlu's baby
formula and led to kidney stone illness of more than 1200 infants
across the country.

The number of companies with melamine-tainted milk accounted for
20.18 percent of the total of milk powder companies in China. And the
number of tainted batches accounted for 14.05 percent of the total
batches tested.

The melamine content in the Sanlu brand reached 2563 mg per kg, the
highest among all the samples. In other samples, the range was from
0.09 mg to 619 mg per kilogram.

Authorities have sealed the problematic milk powder products in
companies, or removed them from store shelves and recalled all those sold.

Safe powder milk products will continue to be sold on market to
ensure enough supply, according to the State Council.

To ensue the quality safety, the quality inspection bodies will
dispatch supervisors to each baby milk powder company since Wednesday
[17 Sep 2008] to oversee the quality of raw materials and production
procedures. Every batch of products will be checked.

Sanlu, which is 43 percent owned by New Zealand dairy company
Fonterra, has been ordered to halt production. The Hebei provincial
government decided on Tuesday [16 Sep 2008] to dispatch 4 working
teams to Sanlu Group for a thorough investigation.

So far, 4 milk dealers have been arrested and 22 others detained for
questioning by Hebei police.

China to destroy 10 000 tons of tainted baby formula
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/15/content_10008205.htm>

More than 10 000 tons of baby formula that was seized and recalled in
the Sanlu milk powder contamination scandal will be destroyed said
the government of Shijiazhuang, capital of north China's Hebei

Authorities have so far seized 2176 tons of milk powder in the
warehouse of Sanlu Group, producer of the milk powder that gave
kidney stones to hundreds of infants across the country, and recalled
8218 tons that had been on the market, said Shijiazhuang Vice Mayor Li Jinlu.

[In the most recent PRO/MBDS posting on this event, there had been
reports of 59 cases of kidney stones with one death, all occurring in
Gansu province, and all related to the use of a single manufacturer's
infant milk powder in which melamine contamination had been
identified. At that time, the Ministry of Health began active
surveillance to identify if the problem existed in other provinces
(see Infant kidney stones - China (02): Gansu, milk, melamine
20080912.2857). From the newswire information above, there have now
been 6244 infants identified with illness attributable to the use of
melamine contaminated infant milk around the country, with 3 deaths
(2 in Gansu Province and one in Zhejiang Province). Of these affected
children 1327 are still hospitalized and 158 have acute kidney
failure (see
<http://www.forbes.com/markets/2008/09/17/china-milk-scandal-markets-equity-cx_tw_0917markets03.html>).


Inspection of infant milk products made by 109 different dairy milk
producers identified 22 different dairy milk producers with evidence
of melamine in their milk products (20.2 percent of companies
inspected -- note, the numbers of companies inspected varies from the
NY Times report and the Xinhua report). Of all of the products
tested, apparently the amount of melamine found in the originally
implicated product (Sanlu) had the highest levels. We await further
information as the investigation continues.

Of note is that in the New York Times article, there is mention of
traces of melamine found in a frozen yogurt product made from an
Inner Mongolia producer, and Hong Kong has initiated a recall of the
product. It should be noted that the Inner Mongolia producer -- the
Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group -- is also in the group of
producers of infant milk products.
