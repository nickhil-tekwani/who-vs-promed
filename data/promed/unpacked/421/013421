Asia has been a hot spot for HPAIV outbreaks for more than 20 years and most of the new lineage strains and genetic reassortments were produced within or near this region. Outbreaks of HPAI H5N8 re-emerged in eastern Asia in the last part of 2020. The high sequence homology recently observed with isolates in Europe during the winter season 2019-2020 suggests that the variants currently causing outbreaks in Asia came from Europe, perhaps via bird migration. With regards to HPAI H5N1, the Indian Subcontinent has experienced outbreaks in domestic poultry and other birds almost every year since the 1st report in 2006. Since November 2016, also subtype H5N8 outbreaks were reported in India, Pakistan, and Nepal. - Mod.PMB]
