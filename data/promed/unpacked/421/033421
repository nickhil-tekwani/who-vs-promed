BLUETONGUE - MALTA: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Arnon Shimshony <arnon@promedmail.org>


ProMED-mail's posting "Bluetongue - Europe (38): BTV-8, EU, UK" of 9
Oct 2007, which introduced EFSA's map showing the areas in Europe
where the various Bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes are present,
included the following remark: "The size of the map does not allow
noting the situation in Malta."

The said difficulty has now been overcome by the application of a
higher magnitude of the EFSA map. In its current version, Malta and
the Italian island Lampedusa, west of Malta, are marked as infected
by BTV serotypes 2,4,9 and 16; see at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.

OIE's WAHID interface website does not include information on Malta's
bluetongue situation (no reports submitted since January 2005);
similarly, the EU ADNS database for the years 2005, 2006 and for the
current year (update of 19 Oct 2007) does not include such
information (see at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/index_en.htm>).

Authoritative information on the bluetongue situation in Malta will
be appreciated.
