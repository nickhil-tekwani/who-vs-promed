More likely, you were just being seen by a well trained ID/TropMed
specialist. We have a long list of interesting questions to ask
patients with puzzling illnesses, including ones about caves, bats,
pigeons, deer, cats, chickens, squirrels, cheese, sausage, flying
insects, crawling insects, dozens about where you work (slaughterhouse?
arc welding? foundry?), and more questions about sex than you want
to know. These often turn up a critical bit of history which leads to
a otherwise unsuspected diagnosis.
(I agree with the moderator's comments about malaria...)
