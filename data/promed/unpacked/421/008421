NE China reports more cases of cutaneous anthrax infection
----------------------------------------------------------
A total of 9 more people are suspected of being infected with
cutaneous anthrax in north east China's Liaoning Province, bringing
the total number of reported cases to 30, local health authorities
said on Friday [12 Aug 2011].

Among the reported cases, 3 have been confirmed and 27 others are
still being investigated, the Liaoning Provincial Health Department
said in a statement. 29 of the patients are receiving treatment at an
infectious disease hospital in the city of Anshan, while the other one
has been transferred to a hospital in the provincial capital of
Shenyang.

An initial investigation by local health authorities indicated that
the patients contracted the disease after coming into direct contact
with diseased cattle. Cutaneous anthrax is an infection of the skin
caused by direct contact with infected animals or animal products. It
is rarely fatal if treated.

[This report indicates that the cause was contact with sick and/or
dead cattle, the number as yet uncertain. As one does not know how
many were sick and butchered, and how many were dead when found and
either just tossed or also butchered, it is at best a guessing game.
But at a conservative estimate of 6 to 10 humans per affected animal,
these 30 human cases might represent 3 to 5 affected cattle. Any such
ratios must be geographically based; for example, in some English
records for the mid 1930s I found that knackers (renderers) had
processed 10 anthrax carcasses for each man with reported skin
lesions. In Central Africa it can be 15 human cases or more per
carcass butchered. - Mod.MHJ
