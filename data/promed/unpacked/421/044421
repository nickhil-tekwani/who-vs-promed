Cattle diseases have broken out in 2 upazilas [subdistricts] of the
district during the last 7 days, thus making the poor farmers quite
panicky. The upazilas are Haimchar and Faridganj.

Faridganj Upazila Livestock and Animal Resource officer Pabitra Kumar
Saha told this correspondent that in different villages of 12 No
Chardukhia union under Faridganj upazila, about 1000 cattle have been
attacked with a bacterial disease called Torka during the 7 days in
different areas of this upazila.

Due to extreme heat, this bacteria has broken out in the grass etc.,
and after eating this grass, cattle are being attacked with this
disease, and they are dying day by day due to the diseases related to
this bacteria, added the Livestock Officer. The farmers take
preventive measures to save their cows , bulls and goats by
anti-bacteria vaccines available at the Upazila Livestock and Animal
Resources Office in Faridganj.

On the other hand, in different villages of the neighbouring Haimchar
upazila, as many as 35 cows and bulls have died of the said Torka
disease during the last 7 to 8 days, said sources in Haimchar
upazilla Livestock and Animal Resources office. This information was
confirmed by Faridganj Upazila Livestock and Animal Resource Officer
Pabitra Kr Saha.

The panicky farmers are passing their days in great anxiety with
their cows, bulls and goats, said many farmers in Faridganj and
Haimchar upazilas.

[Those acquainted with the vernacular names of animal diseases in
Bangladesh are hereby requested to clarify the term Torka, which --
according to the above source -- is a bacterial disease affecting
cattle and goats (infectious pleuropneumonia?!). Three other names of
animal diseases in Bangladesh, which have been mentioned in local
media on previous occasions, are Gola Phula, Badla and Khurarog. The
latter is, apparently, FMD; information on the scientific names of
Torka, as well as of Gola Phula and Badla, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
