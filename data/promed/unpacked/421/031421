The New Jersey Department of Agriculture has quarantined a Warren County farm after a 22-year-old mare recently tested positive for a highly infectious disease.

The state says the horse developed equine herpes myeloencephalopathy, an often deadly form of the equine herpes virus.

The horse, which the state said had not left the farm property "in years," was euthanized on 31 Mar 2013. Other horses at the farm have not shown signs of the virus.

Spokeswoman Lynne Richmond said the Department of Agriculture is declining to provide the name and location of the farm at this time. It is the 3rd case of the virus this year [2013] in New Jersey, with similar quarantines having already occurred in Somerset and Gloucester counties.

"The department took swift action to prevent the disease from spreading to other horses by enacting a quarantine, which stops movement of horses in and out of the farm and puts in place preventive measures to contain the virus," state Secretary of Agriculture Douglas Fisher said in a statement.

The state says the disease can be detected through a number of clinical signs such as respiratory problems and spontaneous abortions of pregnant mares. The incubation period of the virus ranges from 2 to 10 days.

As was the case with the horse in Warren County, some horses have the virus but do not show signs of it, Richmond said. If the virus becomes neurological later in a horse's life, that's when it can become especially lethal, Richmond said.

The virus is not a threat to humans and most other domestic animals and can be neutralized with the use of hand soap, sanitizers, and sunlight. The state urges owners who suspect their horses have been exposed to the disease to call a local veterinarian immediately.

[The disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
