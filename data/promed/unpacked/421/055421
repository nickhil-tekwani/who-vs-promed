Tick-borne Encephalitis in Sweden and Climate Change
----------------------------------------------------
An increase in tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Sweden appears to have
occurred after a series of warm winters, researchers reported on Thu 5 Jul
2001. Their findings suggest that populations of disease-carrying ticks may
increase in northern climates around the globe if predictions of global
warming pan out, according to Dr. Elisabet Lindgren of Stockholm University
and Dr. Rolf Gustafson of Huddinge University Hospital in Stockholm.
TBE is caused by a virus that is transmitted to humans through the bite of
a tick. The illness occurs in scattered areas of Europe, including Sweden,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Hungary. The first symptoms are
flu-like, followed by tremor and dizziness due to brain inflammation. The
infection can be fatal in rare cases, but a vaccine is available.
In the study, the team of researchers compared temperature data from 1960
to 1998 with the number of cases of TBE in Stockholm County. "The findings
indicate that the increase in TBE incidence since the mid-1980s is related
to the period's change towards milder winters and early arrival of spring,"
according to the report in the 7 Jul 2001 issue of The Lancet [see below -
Mod.CP. Specifically the study notes that: "The spring vegetation season
has advanced by 12 days on average...between 1960 and the mid-1990s."
The researchers comment in their report that: "Other factors may have
influenced" rates of infection, such as more people traveling to areas
where encephalitis-carrying ticks live. They also note that the increase in
ticks may be a result of rise in populations of host animals like deer and
small mammals. Nonetheless, the authors write that "there has been a global
warming trend during the last 2 decades of the 20th century, with the years
1990, 1995 and 1997 having the highest mean temperatures ever registered in
the northern hemisphere. In Sweden, the change towards a milder climate has
been suggested to have contributed to latitude shifts in the northern
distribution limit of the _Ixodes ricinus_ tick and a general increase in
tick population density between the early and mid-1990s."

[The paper entitled "Tick-borne encephalitis in Sweden and climate change"
by Elisabet Lindgren and Rolf Gustafson is published in The Lancet, Volume
358, Number 9275, 7 Jul 2001
<http://www.thelancet.com/journal/vol358/iss9275/full/llan.358.9275.original
_research.16801.1>.
The authors write that: "The incidence of TBE in Sweden has substantially
increased since the mid-1980s. During the same period the climate has
become milder and ticks have become more abundant. We investigated whether
there is a link between the change in climate and the increase in incidence
of TBE.
Since the late 1950s all cases of encephalitis admitted in Stockholm County
have been serologically tested for TBE. We analyzed the period 1960-98 with
multiple regressions. The number of days per season with temperatures of
known importance for tick prevalence and pathogen transmission were
studied. 2 years of temperature data were related to each TBE incidence
rate to account for the tick's long life-span. Increases in disease
incidence was significantly related to a combination of 2 consecutive mild
winters, temperatures favouring spring development (8-10ºC) and extended
autumn activity (5-8ºC) in the year prior to the incidence year, and
temperatures allowing tick activity (5-8ºC) early in the incidence year.
These findings indicate that the increase in TBE incidence since the
mid-1980s is related to the period's change towards milder winters and
early arrival of spring. Other factors may have influenced TBE incidence
such as more people in endemic locations, and increases in host animal
populations; factors which are partly climate related. Access to TBE
vaccination since 1986 and increased awareness of ticks might have caused
an underestimation of the links found. Our findings also suggest that the
incidence of other tick-borne zoonoses might have been affected by the
milder climate."
The paper includes a detailed analysis of the effects of temperature on the
life cycle of the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ in Sweden. - Mod.CP
