At the district hospital of Odisha's Malkangiri [district], 2 more children succumbed to Japanese encephalitis while undergoing treatment on Sunday [6 Nov 2016], taking the death toll in the dreaded vectorborne disease to 97 in 59 days.

The deceased were identified as a 2 year old of Tulibeda village of Korukonda block and another 2 year old of Kumutiguda in the district, reports said.

A 12-member team, including 7 experts of the state health department and the Centre, has been visiting the district since Saturday [5 Nov 2016] to take stock of the situation. The team has visited Daniguda, Badali, Palakonda and Doriguda villages in 4 groups for a ground survey. A total of 2 girls and a 2 year old boy had died due to the disease on Saturday [5 Nov 2016].

[The number of encephalitis cases continues to climb from 74 on 30 Oct 2016 to the 97 reported above. The previous report indicated that only 27 of those 74 cases were due to JE, the remainder were classified as acute encephalitis syndrome (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20161103.4603728), which does not mention or imply a specific etiologic agent. It will be interesting to learn about the team's findings.

Cases of Japanese encephalitis were detected recently in few areas coming under the jurisdiction of Agartala Municipal Corporation (AMC). "We generally conduct health camps every week in different areas of West District. In the screening test, we got sporadic cases of Japanese encephalitis in few areas of the district like Amtali, Mohanpur, Abhoynagar etc. However, there is no report of malaria as of now," said Dr Goutam Debnath, chief medical officer of West District.

He also stated that these viral diseases are transmitted by a mosquito known as _Aedes aegypti_. "These 2 diseases are mainly prevalent in the areas under AMC. But this type of mosquito is not found in Tripura," Dr Debnath said. [And Japanese encephalitis virus is transmitted by culex mosquitoes, not by _Aedes aegypti_. - Mod.TY].

The number of patients of Japanese encephalitis (JE) has also risen in last 3 years. A total 63 positive cases of Japanese encephalitis were recorded till August this year [2016]. Only 1 person died of the disease.

As there was no cases of JE found since 2010-2012, the trend was noticed in 2013 with 14 positive cases. Again in 2014, a total 14 JE positive cases were recorded. The number of JE-affected people was found 28 in the subsequent year [2015], I which 4 people died of the disease.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in north eastern India, including Tripura state, and cases occur there yearly during the transmission season. This report indicates that all the reported cases are JE only and does not attribute any cases to the non-specific acute encephalitis syndrome that has been reported in many previous reports from north eastern India. There is no indication if the JE cases reported above had been vaccinated, or if a vaccination campaign in the state is planned. - Mod.TY]
