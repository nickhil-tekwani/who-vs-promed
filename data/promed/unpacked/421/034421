The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently confirmed the first detection of sweet orange scab in Alabama. The fruit sample was collected in Baldwin County by Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries during a delimiting survey for citrus greening disease. Auburn University and USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed the diagnosis.

The positive plant was found in a residential area. A delimiting survey will be conducted in January 2018 to determine if this is an isolated case.

[Sweet orange scab (SOR) caused by the fungus _Elsinoe australis_ has been reported from several countries in South America as well as New Caledonia, Eritrea and Sicily. In areas where it is absent, its introduction is considered a serious risk to crops for the fresh fruit market. The most economically important hosts of SOR are sweet orange and mandarin varieties. Symptoms on fruit may include cream coloured round lesions and pustules (scab), furrows and cracks in the rind, discolouration of the rind surrounding the lesions, as well as deformation of young fruits which usually disappears during maturation. In rare cases, lesions and pustules may also appear on leaves and twigs.

The pathogen overwinters in the tree canopy, primarily on fruit. In the absence of fruit, it may survive in old leaves and stem lesions, but it is unclear how this can occur. Spores may be spread by rain splash between trees, on air currents for short distances, and with plant and other materials. Long distance spread appears to be mainly due to movement of contaminated fruit. Disease management relies on quarantine for pathogen exclusion and properly timed fungicide applications.

In the US, the disease was reported for the first time in 2010 from Texas (ProMED-mail post 20100818.2864) and subsequently in several other states. It had previously been declared a quarantine threat (ProMED-mail post 20060513.1361).

The related _E. fawcettii_ causes common citrus scab (sour orange scab). Differences include the host range, the common occurrence of symptoms on leaves and a lower optimal growth temperature.
