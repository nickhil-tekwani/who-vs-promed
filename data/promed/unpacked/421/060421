Dear Colleagues,

The 8th International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED) is extending the Call for Abstracts submission deadline to 14 Jul 2021. This gives you extra time to collect and submit your research! (https://imed.isid.org/abstract-submission/).

We understand that this past year has been challenging; nonetheless, we hope this deadline extension will offer extra time to help you prepare your abstract submissions and showcase your best work. This year [2021], category research topics submitted so far include using genomics to track epidemics, epidemic surveillance focused on data gaps and needs globally, and COVID-19 updates surrounding variants, vaccines, and pathogenesis.

For those of you who are not submitting abstracts, this is a reminder that registration for the 8th IMED is open. All are welcomed in becoming part of the Many Voices of One Health! Join a diverse group of colleagues from around the world as they present new knowledge and breakthroughs about how to discover, detect, understand, prevent, and respond to outbreaks of emerging disease threats.

For more information, please go: https://imed.isid.org/.

We look forward to your submission!
