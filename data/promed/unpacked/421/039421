Anthrax outbreak feared to be spreading in Zimbabwe
---------------------------------------------------
Anthrax is feared to be spreading in Zimbabwe as veterinary officials
said on Monday [28 Dec 2009] they are testing a suspected case of the
deadly disease from a rural growth point about 50 kilometers [about
30 miles] East of Harare. The suspected case followed an outbreak of
the disease in central parts of the country last week, which killed
one person and 25 cattle.

Veterinary Services Department deputy director Chenjerai Njagu told
Xinhua on Monday that the results of the suspected case from Juru
Growth Point in Goromonzi district would be out on Tuesday. He said
the area is one of the few districts which were left out during
vaccination done at the beginning of the year. "We left out Goromonzi
and Seke districts because of shortage of vaccines," said Njagu. "Now
these are the areas giving us problems because we had not vaccinated
them at the beginning of the year."

The anthrax outbreak in Seke, some 40 km [25 miles] South-East of
Harare, killed 18 cattle while one person and 7 cattle succumbed to
the disease which broke out last week in Selous, 60 km [37 miles]
North-West of the capital.

Njagu said the disease was dangerous as one case can kill several
people who consume meat from an infected animal. He said the
department would soon move into the affected areas to vaccinate
cattle. The department vaccinated 1100 cattle in Seke over the
Christmas holiday but Njagu said the turnout was very low. "The
turnout was low and we are going to repeat vaccination after the
holiday," he said.

Anthrax is a soil-borne disease which is endemic in Zimbabwe. It is
normally recorded during the rainy season when sprouting grass brings
out the bacteria from soil.

[The previous report claimed a target of vaccinating 100 000 and this
indicates problems getting 1100 animals vaccinated. As this evolving
epidemic is close to Harare, I think we can be more optimistic about
its eventual control than one, say, in Matabeleland. The tragedy is
that before it was Zimbabwe this disease was tightly controlled and
only a handful of outbreaks each year. - Mod.MHJ]
