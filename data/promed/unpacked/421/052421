A cargo ship bound for a Quebec port will be intercepted by Canadian
authorities, after it was learned that an officer on board died of the
bacterial disease anthrax this week.
The Wadi Al Arab, an Egyptian vessel carrying about 50 000 tons of bauxite
to an Alcan aluminum plant in Saguenay, will be diverted to Halifax and
inspected by Health Canada, Transport Canada, and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police for possible anthrax contamination.
An Alcan spokesperson alerted health officials after being told by the crew
the first mate had died from anthrax and had been left behind in Brazil. By
midnight last night, the ship was over 300 nautical miles outside Canadian
waters, about a day's journey away. It will not be allowed into any other
port until shown to be disease-free.

[This article leaves us with many questions. What type of anthrax did the
individual have -- cutaneous, gastric, or inhalation? There is no mention
of the lesions, but if it was not cutaneous, how was the diagnosis made?
Where did he come into contact with the bacteria, and was he infected
before boarding the ship? We look forward to an authoritative report from
the Canadian officials regarding their findings. - Mod.TG]
