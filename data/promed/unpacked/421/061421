Bacteria in pasta salad suspected to have sickened 100 in 6 provinces
------------------------------------------------------
TORONTO (CP): At least 100 people are suspected to have become ill after
eating bacteria infected pasta salad distributed in grocery stores,
hospital cafeterias, delis, and restaurants from Ontario to Newfoundland
and Labrador, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency warned on Saturday.
"There is a public health threat here and [the salad] has been widely
distributed," said Gord Haugh, spokesman for the Ontario Ministry of
Health. Both Haugh and Dr Colin D'Cunha, Ontario's chief medical officer of
health, said they expect to see more cases crop up in the next few days.
The Greek-style pasta salad was made in Toronto by Tiffany Gate Foods
between 2 and 18 May 2002 and is being recalled voluntarily by the company.
Anyone who ate the salad may be infected with the _Shigella sonnei_
bacteria and should consult a doctor.
Because the salad was distributed in large, commercial-size containers and
repackaged into smaller containers or sold to consumers in serving portions
at deli counters, people may not know that they ate the infected salad,
Haugh said. _Shigella sonnei_ infection is reported in about 400 people a
year in Ontario, D'Cunha said, and is transmitted from person to person
through fecal-oral contact.
The salad is known to have been distributed in Ontario, Quebec, Prince
Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland to the
following grocery stores and cafeterias: A&P, Atlantic Superstores, Barn
Market, Dominion, Farrons, Fiesta Farms, Foodliner, Fortino's, IGA,
Loblaws, Loeb, Sun Valley Fine Foods, Super F, Ultra-Mart, Valumart,
Wright's Bros Farm Market, Your Independent Grocer, Zehr's, Ziggy's,
Dine-E-Zee Hurontario, Essential Foods, McMaster Meats and Deli, Open
Window Health Bread, Cafe 493, St. Michael's Hospital cafeteria, and
Toronto General Hospital cafeteria. Tiffany Gate Foods may have also
distributed the affected product to other grocery stores, cafeterias and
restaurants.
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is monitoring the effectiveness of the
recall. For more information, call 1-800-561-3350 in Quebec and
1-800-442-2342 in other provinces and territories.

[The initial report of contamination of a widely distributed pasta salad
with shigella bacteria is followed by more than 100 reports of clinical
disease so far, with the possibility of more cases. This type of foodborne
outbreak is a good example of the problems of centralized food preparation
with repackaging in spreading contaminated food and difficulties in
identifying the vehicle. The infectious dose of shigella is very low,
sometimes fewer than 200 organisms. Shigellosis presents with classical
bacillary dysentery with high fever and frequent diarrheal stools
containing blood and mucus. - Mod.LL]
