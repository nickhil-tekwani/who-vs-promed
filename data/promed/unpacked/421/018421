Rodent plague, a bacterial infection, (also called rabbit fever) is spreading among people in Switzerland. A growing number of incidents with tick bites has been recorded over the past few years. The Federal Health Office counted 130 confirmed cases of tularemia in 2017, according to Swiss public radio, SRF. This is 4 times more than usual.

The authorities called on doctors to report all such cases. A decision on coordinated campaign measures will be taken later this year [2018]. Experts say the disease can be treated with antibacterials, but it can be deadly if not detected in time.

The best precaution against rodent plague is for humans to protect against tick bites, according to the Federal Health Office.

The relatively little-known disease in rabbits and other wild animals is apparently transmitted to humans by contact with infected animal tissue and ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headaches, muscle pain, enlarged lymph nodes and ulcers on the skin, according to medical sources.

[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

The infection does not spread from person to person essentially in contrast to another Category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted.

_F. tularensis_ infection can present in a variety of ways depending on the route of acquisition. Even before the antimicrobial era, pneumonia due to inhalation of _Francisella tularensis_ seemed to account for most of the deaths related to the infection (1). A good review of the subject written by Thomas and Schaffner can be found in reference 2.
