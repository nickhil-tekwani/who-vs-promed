African swine fever [ASF] has been diagnosed in 2 wild boars in the Legionowski district, about 30 km [about 18.6 mi] north of Warsaw. That is what the German stakeholder organization of pig farmers, ISN, announces.

Restrictive measures have been taken in the area for the transport of pigs and manure. A buffer zone has been set around the area. The virus makes a jump in Poland towards the west.

In recent weeks, there has been a clear increase in ASF outbreaks among wild boar in the affected areas of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and the Czech Republic. The number of outbreaks of ASF on pig farms has not increased further in recent weeks. The ISN calls for the utmost vigilance to prevent the introduction of the disease into Germany. This week, a large-scale exercise started in Germany, in which an outbreak of ASF is simulated.

[Information on the significant westwards spread of ASF by wild boar in Poland has been published also by a Russian agricultural website at http://agro2b.ru/en/news/45811-African-swine-fever-came-Warsaw.html. According to this source, 2 days ago [Tue 21 Nov 2017], the chief veterinarian of Poland reported the identification of 33 new outbreaks of ASF among wild boar. Among them, 2 cases were discovered in the north of Warsaw, almost 100 km [approx. 62 mi] from the nearest outbreak in Eastern Poland.

Agro2b further informs that an emergency meeting at the regional headquarters for crisis management was immediately held. The meeting was attended by representatives of local authorities, veterinary services, law enforcement agencies and representatives of the provincial crisis management center. The incident was reported to the relevant provincial and national authorities, as well as to the European Commission, which on its part published the official decision No. 2017/2176 dated [21 Nov 2017] introducing temporary protective measures, expressed in the extension of security zones of ASF in Poland (see at http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32017D2176).

Meanwhile, hunters from the Warsaw urban forests received the green light for sanitary shooting of boars, in order to reduce their density. Failure to comply with plans of shooting is liable to fines.

The Russian report indicates that the German media responded quickly to the 100 km [about 62 mi] westwards leap of ASF. It has been suggested that the spread of the disease from Warsaw to Germany may take place sooner than earlier expectations, because of the good transport links in the Polish A2 motorway, which connects with interstate A12 motorway connecting Berlin and the Polish border. "Since even a piece of discarded sausage may introduce the virus, the German media urged to exercise extra caution", it says. - Mod.AS
