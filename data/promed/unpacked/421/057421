Baton Rouge Bird Tests Positive for West Nile Virus
---------------------------------------------------
A cardinal from East Baton Rouge Parish has tested positive for West
Nile virus. The bird was found at a Baton Rouge residence and was
delivered to the Louisiana Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at the LSU
Veterinary School, where the test for the virus was conducted.
According to Department of Health and Hospitals Office of Public
Health, this is the first case of West Nile virus ever confirmed in
East Baton Rouge Parish. The bird was found in the vicinity of
Flannery Road, near the border of East Baton Rouge and Livingston
parishes.
In response to this case, the Mosquito Control Board has been notified
and the Office of Public Health has initiated the surveillance of the
most common carriers of this disease, such as crows, blue jays and
raptors. The Office of Public Health also asks citizens for their
assistance by bringing dead birds to their nearest parish health
unit's Environmental Health Services. The Centers for Disease Control
advise that there is no danger of contracting WNV from handling intact
dead birds, however, the following procedure is suggested to keep
hands clean when collecting a specimen: Turn a plastic bag inside-out,
and pick up the bird with the hands protected by the bag. Turn the bag
right-side-out. The bag should then be tied or sealed and placed
inside another plastic bag.
Health officials also remind residents to take the standard
precautions to protect themselves from mosquito bites, and to limit
the breeding ground for mosquitoes. These precautions include wearing
long sleeves and long pants when outside and using insect repellant on
exposed skin. Mosquitoes are most active around dusk and around dawn.

West Nile Virus Found in Dead Cardinal in East Baton Rouge
----------------------------------------------------------
A dead cardinal found last month in East Baton Rouge Parish was
infected with West Nile virus, which can cause encephalitis in humans.
It is the first case of the virus diagnosed in a bird in East Baton
Rouge Parish. Last summer, birds, a horse and a man were diagnosed
with West Nile encephalitis in other parts of the state. Birds act as
reservoirs for the virus. Mosquitoes bite the birds and then bite
humans or other animals, infecting them. Migrating birds help move the
disease quickly from one part of the country to another.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Mosquito and Rodent Abatement District has
sprayed the area where the bird was found several times recently, said
Guy Faget, a biologist and pilot of the agency's pesticide-spraying
plane.
Last year, West Nile [virus hospitalized a drifter in Kenner. Dr.
Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist, said last year's experience
showed West Nile was established in Louisiana. At that time, he
predicted it would reappear after the winter but said he could not
predict if a disease outbreak would occur.
