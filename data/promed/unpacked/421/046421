PHYTOPHORA BOEHMERIAE ON COTTON - GREECE
****************************************

A new disease of cotton (_Gossypium hirsutum_) was observed for the
first time in Greece in August 1993 in Larissa (at first localized in an
area of 20 ha) and Volos countries, and in August and September 1995 in
Trikala and Phthiotis counties. The disease is a severe boll rot.
Initially, localized spots appear and progressively coalesce to cover
the whole cotton boll. Infected tissues turn almost black. Infection
is generally restricted to the lower half (or two-thirds) of cotton
plants. _Phytophthora boehmeriae_ was isolated from diseased plants.
Colony morphology, growth rate, features of asexual and sexual
structures, maximum growth temperatures were examined. The
pathogenicity of the Greek isolates was confirmed by artificial
inoculation of detached cotton bolls. In addition, the analysis of
a-esterase isozyme revealed a
unique pattern for _P. boehmeriae_ when compared to _P. cactorum_ and
_P. parasitica_.
_P. boehmeriae_ was first described in 1927 by Sawada as a new
species on _Boehmeria nivea_ (ramie-a fibre plant), in Formosa
(Taiwan). This fungus is also reported to cause brown rot on
citrus fruits in Argentina, root rot of _Pinus patula_ in
Australia, and cotton boll rot in China. Paper mulberry
(_Broussonetia papyrifera_) is also reported as a host in China.
The geographical distribution of the fungus is the following:
EPPO region: Greece
Asia: China, Japan, Taiwan
South America: Argentina
Oceania: Australia (Queensland, New South Wales)
Chinese papers report that: 1) oospores of _P. boehmeriae_ can
overwinter in the soil and act as the primary infection source of cotton
boll rot (Zheng et al., 1992); 2) sporangia or oospores can be detected
on seeds from infected bolls and appear to be able to transmit the
disease to plants (Zhang et al., 1995).
The authors stressed that this is the first report of _Phytophthora
boehmeriae_ in Europe, and that this disease could be a serious threat
to cotton-growing countries.
