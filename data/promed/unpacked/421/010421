Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), commonly known as
blue ear disease, has broken out in Gia Lam District, Ha Noi. Initial tests
have shown that a herd of 57 pigs in the locality have been infected by the
disease.

Another outbreak in central Khanh Hoa Province in mid-October 2007
increased the number of localities affected by the disease to 4. They are
Ha Noi and the provinces of Khanh Hoa, Ca Mau, and Hai Duong.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development asked local provincial
authorities to strictly inspect the transport and slaughter of
un-quarantined animals and disinfect affected areas to curb the
transmission of the virus.

[Bui Ba Bong, deputy minister of agriculture and rural development] said
measures to contain blue ear disease needed to be stepped up in the central
and Mekong Delta provinces struck by floods.

[The above official website of Viet Nam's Department of Animal Health
includes also updates of 31 Oct and 1 Nov 2007 in Vietnamese (probably to
be published in English later).

In postings 20070927.3203 and 20071014.3372, ProMED-mail requested
information on the results of the investigation concerning the Vietnamese
PRRS virus, carried out in the USA (reportedly at NVSL, FADDL, Plum Island,
NY), pertaining to the virus' pathogenicity and, if possible, its
similarity to the Chinese strain. In view of the potential international
impact of the spreading virus, the request is hereby repeated.

It would also be useful to obtain information on the PRRS situation in
Myanmar, into which -- according to unconfirmed media reports -- the
pathogenic virus has spread after seriously affecting China and Viet Nam.

Noteworthy, on 30 Oct 2007, Russia notified the OIE of an outbreak of PRRS
("North American genotype") in free-range pigs fed on swill in the central
Siberian Irkutsk oblast; for the notification and map, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6410>.
