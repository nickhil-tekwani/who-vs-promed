Nigerian health authorities on Friday [12 Jan 2006] confirmed a new
outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the Sokoto state in country's far north.
This is the first case of bird flu after months of any such
infections in Africa's most-populous nation. The last known infection
occurred in September.
Authorities are also investigating at least 2 suspected cases in
nearby Katsina [see 20070111.0130] and sufficient steps are taken to
contain the infection.
According to Dr. Garba Sharabutu, a veterinarian and president of the
Nigerian veterinarian association, "We have one [case] that has been
confirmed in one of the farms here in Sokoto."
"Right now, we have moved most of our people there. And, they are
actually doing the stamping out, trying to control the disease within
the farm. They are really spraying the farm, and they have killed all
the birds and buried them properly," he added.
Red Bolivia newspaper reports that the first cases of bird flu were
detected in the country about a year ago. Despite repeated claims
from the authorities that the disease has been wiped out, it has
become endemic in Nigeria after a number of states have reported
suspected cases in the last few months.
Since [2006], Nigeria has culled more than 450 000 infected chickens.
However, no human case has so far been reported.

[Sokoto lies to the west of Katsina; both Nigerian states are on the
northern frontier, bordering Niger. See map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/nigeria_pol93.jpg>.
According to a newswire dated 11 Jan 2006, 2 outbreaks were
reportedly identified in Katsina and 2 additional outbreaks were,
reportedly, suspected -- under investigation (see archived 20070111.0130).
Official confirmation (or otherwise) relating to the media reports
from both states, including epidemiological data and particularly the
identity of the avian influenza virus -- in case confirmed -- is
expected. Nigeria's last (5th) avian influenza follow-up report was
sent to the OIE on 2 Apr 2006; see at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_24.htm#Sec8>.
A map showing the locations of the 2006 outbreaks in Nigeria is
available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahidprod/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=NGA&public_disease=15&reportid=4494
>.
According to a 2006 phylogenetic analysis (see Mod.CP's commentary in
archived 20060707.1864), the HPAI H5N1 virus strains in northern
Nigeria and in Lagos state belong to 3 distinct genetic lineages and
were therefore probably introduced independently. - Mod.AS]
