[Detecting, treating and following up with contacts over such a broad geographic area is a challenge for Nigeria's health care workers and epidemiologists as the number of Lassa fever cases and deaths continues to rise. It is encouraging to see international groups of health care workers and experts going to Nigeria. Recently, a team of UK experts is being sent to Nigeria to help the country contain the biggest outbreak of Lassa fever in recent years (https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/uk-experts-scrambled-fight-nigeria-lassa-fever-outbreak/).

As noted previously, Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Preventing Lassa virus transmission requires getting local people to understand that virus spread to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta and can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. Rodent control and prevention of contact with rodent excreta has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.

Images of the mastomys mouse, the rodent reservoir of Lassa fever virus, can be seen at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis.
