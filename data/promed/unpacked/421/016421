The disease has now been confirmed in the following parishes -- Ascension,
East Baton Rouge, and in the southern part of Tangipahoa (it is a long thin
N-S parish), which means that is now in the 'Florida' parishes, north of
Lake Pontchartrain and will move into Mississippi. Five horses near to the
emu farm in Vermilion Parish have been noted to have symptoms and blood
samples are being examined. The human case is in intensive care and the
outcome is uncertain.
The following data was provided by the State Epidemiologist's office today.
