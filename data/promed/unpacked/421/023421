The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) has confirmed rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) in 3 feral domestic rabbits found dead on Orcas Island. The findings are part of the ongoing investigation into a case of RHDV2 confirmed on the island earlier this month [July 2019] in a pet rabbit that died suddenly [see 20190722.6581856].

RHDV2 has been confirmed in the feral rabbit population on Orcas Island. Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) is no longer asking for reports and collection of dead wild or feral rabbits on the island.

RHD is a viral disease that causes sudden death in rabbits and can be spread through contact with infected rabbits, their meat or their fur, or materials coming in contact with them. It poses no human health risk.

Now that the disease has been confirmed in the feral population on Orcas Island, WSDA is no longer asking the public to contact our office for testing of the feral or wild rabbits there. WSDA would still like reports of rabbit mortality on any other island or the mainland to track the virus presence and movement. Domestic rabbit owners who suspect their rabbits have died from RHDV2 are still urged to contact their veterinarian and the Washington State Veterinarian's Office.

The Orcas Island outbreak response began on [9 Jul 2019] when the state vet's office received a report of a dead domestic pet rabbit from a veterinarian clinic on Orcas Island. The veterinarian and the owner suspected possible RHD and contacted the State Veterinarian's Office. The remains of the dead rabbit were sent to state and federal animal disease labs for testing. On [18 Jul 2019] the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the disease.

Following the confirmation of RHDV2, Acting State Veterinarian Dr Amber Itle, went to Orcas Island to interview the pet owner, talk with local rabbit owners and look for evidence of the disease in the feral population. The infected property is currently under quarantine.

"I talked with several rabbit owners, a breeder, a local veterinarian clinic, an extension agent and an animal rehabilitation center in the area," Dr Itle said. "Their cooperation helped me get in contact with a resident who found several dead feral rabbits. After testing those rabbits, we are relatively confident the disease has taken hold in the feral population. At this time, reports have been localized to a one-square-mile area. No further testing is necessary to confirm that fact."

Prior to this detection, Canadian animal health officials confirmed the disease in feral rabbits in British Columbia in February, 2018. The disease has since been confirmed in 10 locations in and around Vancouver Island. The 1st case of RHD2 detected in the US was last September [2018] in Ohio.

There are 2 main types of the virus, RHDV1 and RHDV2. The strain found in Ohio was similar to the Canadian RHDV2 strain.

Although RHD poses no risk to human health or other animals, hares, jackrabbits, and wild eastern cottontails may be susceptible to RHDV2. The rabbit that died on Orcas Island was a pet, 2-year-old, male dwarf rabbit. No other rabbits are on the property.

A vaccine for RHDV2 is not currently available in the US. Rabbit owners should practice good biosecurity measures to protect their animals from this disease, such as washing your hands before and after working with rabbits and not sharing equipment with other owners.

Avoid contact with wild or feral rabbits. We recommend burying dead rabbits to reduce the risk of disease transmission. Visit WSDA Ag Briefs for more information about RHD.

We recommend that no one move feral or domestic rabbits from Orcas Island.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

RHD-2 is a variant form of the original RHD-1 virus and differs in the following ways:
- rabbits infected with the RHD-2 virus typically DO NOT show the symptoms that are common with RHD-1 infection so it is far more difficult to diagnose from simple observations;
- deaths from RHD-2 occur later and over a longer period of time than RHD-1: typically this is 3-9 days following infection and can last up to 5 days, instead of 2-6 days infection and lasting 3-4 days as generally observed with classical RHD-1. Although this is marginal it is important to note from a quarantine perspective;
- only following postmortem examination will initial diagnosis be possible, however further tests are required to definitively confirm RHD-2 which is now recommended for unexplained deaths;
- in mainland Europe, RHD-2 is now very common particularly in France where it was first identified in 2010 and spread country-wide where it was mainly transmitted through the wild rabbit population with cross-over with domestic rabbits. In Italy it has not spread very wide given the differences in wild rabbit population density. A research study has been published that describes the proliferation in RHD-2 in France since 2010 and of relevance to the current situation in the UK;
- although RHD-2 is less virulent than RHD-1, its difficult early diagnosis means it is more challenging given rabbits can carry the disease for a longer period of time without any visible signs of infection. Hence diagnosis of RHD-2 presents a new challenge for the UK.

RHD-2 is a genetically and antigenically different from RHD-1, and the immunogenic differences occur at the serotype level, for which vaccination against both variants is needed.
