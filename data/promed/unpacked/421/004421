News release - Anthrax
----------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed in South Dakota livestock for the 1st time this year [2013]. State Veterinarian Dr. Dustin Oedekoven has confirmed that a 4-month-old calf was lost in a small herd of unvaccinated cattle in Turner County. An alert cattle producer, a local veterinarian, and the SDSU [South Dakota State University] Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory are credited with the rapid detection of the disease in this herd.

Anthrax is a very serious disease of livestock because it can potentially cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a very short time. Affected animals are often found dead with no illness detected.

Strict enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of carcasses from cattle suspected to have died from anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination with the bacterial spores.

Dr. Oedekoven reports that anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated soil and that much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak. Significant climate change, such as drought, floods and winds, can expose anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Alkaline soils, high humidity and high temperatures present conditions for anthrax spores to vegetate and become infectious to grazing livestock.

Producers across the state should consult their veterinarians and vaccinate livestock, if deemed appropriate. Dr. Oedekoven advises producers in the Turner County area to continue to vaccinate cattle and other livestock for the next several years.

[This news release is published word for word in the following Agweek article: http://www.agweek.com/event/article/id/21255/.

Earlier today [19 Jul 2013] I spoke with Dustin, and the key points of this were:
[1] Up until mid-May this year, 2013, they have had a severe drought, with some rain since with green up.
[2] The outbreak was on a small holding which has had a number of anthrax outbreaks in the past, in an area with past outbreaks.
[3] They run 13 cows with calves at heel. They usually vaccinate each year but did not this spring.
[4] The affected animal was a 4-month-old calf dead from no apparent cause; necropsy revealed a swollen haemorrhagic spleen; the owner was persuaded to take a blood sample to the diagnostic lab 45 miles away in Brookings, where anthrax was diagnosed using PCR (polymerase chain reaction).
[5] The herd and 2 neighbouring herds have now been vaccinated.
[6] How this calf came to be infected is still unknown.

It is unusual to see calves affected with anthrax, if for no other reason than that they are suckling, not grazing. And when they graze it is not so fierce as it is with adult cattle -- they are eating grass and little soil. Adult cattle will consume some 5-6 pounds of soil daily. But obviously this calf found something which the others didn't, probably by grazing an old cattle grave site in the pasture. These are most easily located in the fall and winter when the grass is short and after rain when the grave depression fills up with rainwater; believe me, when you know what to look for it is easy. The best method for testing such soils is Antonio Fasanella's GABRI method; see Antonio Fasanella et al, 2013, Ground Anthrax Bacillus Refined Isolation (GABRI) method for analyzing environmental samples with low levels of _Bacillus anthracis_ contamination. BMC Microbiology in press: http://www.biomedcentral.com/imedia/2025383757958657_article.pdf. There is no other method as good nor as sensitive to very low soil contamination levels.

To invoke biting flies there would have to be affected stock or wildlife in the vicinity, but none have been reported so far. Also, a 4-month-old calf has a smaller black-body mass than an adult cow so it would be a secondary target for a blood-meal searching female tabanid.

Speculatively it was an adventuring bull calf that found some choice grazing.

To find Turner County in southeastern South Dakota, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg. Anthrax in the Dakotas is most often seen in the counties along the eastern border with Minnesota, just as the disease most often occurs in the northwestern counties of Minnesota along the North Dakota border. There are exceptions, such as in 2005 when it occurred in 16 counties in central South Dakota. -Mod.MHJ
