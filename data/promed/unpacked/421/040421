The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government said on Wednesday [1 Feb 2012] that preliminary testing of a dead peregrine falcon and a dead black-headed gull [is] positive for the H5 avian influenza virus.

A spokesman for the city's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said that further confirmatory tests are being conducted.

According to AFCD, on 30 Jan 2012, the dead peregrine falcon and black-headed gull were found and collected in the park of Seaview Crescent, Man Tung Road, Tung Chung, and Chun Yin Square Playground, Yuen Long, respectively.

Peregrine falcons are rare winter visitors to Hong Kong, while the black-headed gull is a common visitor.

The spokesman said that there were no poultry farms within 3 km [around 2 mi] of where the dead peregrine falcon was found, but 4 chicken farms are within 3 km of where the dead black-headed gull was found. AFCD staff inspected the farms and found no abnormal mortality or symptoms of avian influenza among the chicken flocks. These farms will be put under enhanced surveillance.

"People should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them," he said, adding that all relevant government departments will continue to remain highly vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian influenza.

[H5N1 outbreaks involving poultry and wild birds in Hong Kong have been occurring since December 2011 (http://web.oie.int/wahis/reports/en_fup_0000011553_20120127_123726.pdf). The peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_) is a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae. In the region, it is usually a breeding resident, but it is not commonly seen in Hong Kong during the winter. The black-headed gull (_Chroicocephalus [=Larus] ridibundus_) is a small gull which breeds in much of Europe and Asia, and also in coastal eastern Canada. Most of the population is migratory, wintering further south, but some birds in the milder westernmost areas of Europe are resident. Because gulls are very susceptible to H5N1, it is very unlikely that they can carry the virus long distances through migration.

[Peregrines have a home range of up to 15 miles radius, so this one could have come from the Chinese mainland.
