Illegal bushmeat trade rife in Europe, research finds
-----------------------------------------------------
More than 5 tonnes of illegal bushmeat are being smuggled in personal
luggage each week through one of Europe's busiest airports, reveals
new research published in 'Conservation Letters'.

Working alongside customs officials at France's Roissy-Charles de
Gaulle airport, researchers from the Zoological Society of London
(ZSL), The Royal Veterinary College (RVC), and The National
Veterinary School and the Natural History Museum of Toulouse,
identified 11 bushmeat species from confiscated luggage, including
species of primates, crocodiles, and pangolins.

This study quantifies for the 1st time the illegal trade of bushmeat
through a European airport.

A total of 134 passengers were searched from 29 flights over a period
of 17 days. The single largest confiscation was of 51 kg [112 lb] of
bushmeat carried by a single passenger with no other luggage.

"Our results estimate that around 270 tonnes of potentially
contaminated illegal bushmeat is passing unchecked through a single
European airport per year, posing a huge potential risk to public
health," says lead author Dr Anne-Lise Chaber, from ZSL and the RVC.

The Central African Republic, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic
of Congo were identified as the main sources of bushmeat. The
researchers conducted conversations with 3 traders in Paris revealing
that, as well as street trading, traders take orders in advance and
arrange delivery of the goods to the customer.

Co-author Dr Marcus Rowcliffe from ZSL says: "Our results show that
this is a lucrative, organised trade feeding into a luxury market; a
4 kg [9 lb] monkey will cost around 100 Euro [approx. USD 124] in
France, compared with just 5 Euro [approx USD 6.20] in Cameroon." He
adds: "Importing bushmeat is relatively easy as customs officials are
given no financial incentives to uncover illegal meat imports,
compared with the bonuses they're awarded for drug and counterfeit
seizures. Also, penalties are very low for people caught carrying
illegal meat."

39 per cent of the confiscated bushmeat was identified as being
listed under the Convention for the Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES), highlighting the unsustainable nature of the trade and its
potential impact on species of conservation concern. In addition to
wildlife conservation concerns, the illegal trade of such large
quantities of bushmeat raises serious questions about the importation
of pathogens into Europe.

"Surveillance methods need to be more robust and deterrents more
severe if we're to have any chance of halting this illegal trade,"
says co-author Dr Andrew Cunningham, from ZSL.

This is the 1st systematic study of the volume and nature of the
international bushmeat trade. The researchers now wish to undertake a
wider-scale study with greater geographic coverage to determine the
overall volume of the illegal bushmeat trade into Europe.

[According to the cited research, it is estimated that travelers
smuggle more than 270 tons a year. Taking into consideration that
this relates just to one single (though major) airport in one
country, the threat to Europe is indeed cause for grave concern.

"Conservation Letters" on 15 Oct 2009, accepted 26 Apr 2010:

Conservation Letters is a new journal of the Society for Conservation
Biology published by Wiley-Blackwell. It is an online-only scientific
journal publishing empirical and theoretical research with
significant implications for the conservation of biological
diversity. - Mod.AS]

[The local market for African bushmeat will be a function of the
resident African population, especially in the area around an
international airport, and weighted for recentness of arrival and
income. There are anecdotal accounts of passengers on the various
Metro trains into such cities having luggage that were leaking bloody
fluids, which would indicate a possible wider risk than to the
African communities. And lastly with the increasing temperatures in
Europe, for example, more regions will be at risk than around just
Madrid and Rome, for example. And we should not forget the very
efficient train services in Europe. - Mod.MHJ]

[This is only one airport in one country. Likely there are other
airports, in other countries, including the US, Canada, and Australia
that may need to perform a similar major airport customs study. The
risk of disease entering a country in this fashion presents a huge
risk, which all customs officials should be more diligent about. - Mod.TG]
