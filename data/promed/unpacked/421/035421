[Note: Now that West Nile virus infection is endemic throughout much
of the Eastern seaboard of the United States, most reports on West
Nile virus infection in year 2002 will be combined and presented as
an "update" at regular, but not more frequent than weekly, intervals
determined by the volume of such reports. As previously, however,
reports of human infection, infection of new hosts, extension of
geographical range and events of special significance will be posted
immediately on receipt. - Mod.CP

Florida: West Nile Virus Found in Miami-Dade Horse
--------------------------------------------------
The Florida Department of Health says that it has a report of a horse
from Miami-Dade that is infected with West Nile virus. This is the
first time that the mosquito-borne virus has shown up in the county.
Last year the virus was found in birds in the county, but there were
no reports of it being transmitted to animals or people.
During 2001 there were 12 confirmed human cases of West Nile virus in
Florida. Most people have mild or no symptoms at all, however in
older people or those with other health issues, it can cause serious
illness and occasionally, death. Because the disease is transmitted
to humans by mosquitoes, the health department is advising Florida
residents to take extra precautions to prevent mosquito bites.

Florida: West Nile Virus Confirmed in Duval County
--------------------------------------------------
Duval County's first case this year of West Nile virus was confirmed
today in a horse, prompting officials to remind residents about the
threat of the disease during active mosquito season. A 5-year-old
mare, which began displaying symptoms 2 weeks ago, became the seventh
animal in Florida to be diagnosed this year.
West Nile virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus are transmitted
from birds to animals and humans by mosquitos [and sometimes cause
serious illness. In 2001, there were 66 human-related cases of
severe disease and 9 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In Oct 2001, a 44-year-old Duval
County man became the eighth person in Florida to be diagnosed with
[West Nile virus-associated disease.
State officials urged people to consider taking precautions against
mosquito bites: avoid outdoors at dusk and dawn, wear repellents, and
eliminate standing water near homes. Officials also urged horse
owners to have their animals vaccinated against the diseases.

A Final Comment Regarding Incubation Period in Humans
-----------------------------------------------------
[In the ProMED-mail post "West Nile virus, incubation period in
humans: RFI 20020423.4015" Dr Manfred Green of the Israel Center for
Disease Control sought information and opinions on the duration of
the incubation period in humans. With the post "West Nile virus,
incubation period in humans (02) 20020424.4023" the thread was judged
to have been cut, but the following brief statement from Dr Duane
Gubler merits posting. - Mod.CP
Early Israeli (1950s) and French (1962) data show that the incubation
period can be as short as 3 days. We list the range as 3 to 14 days.
