According to this [badly written report, the number of people infected
with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus is 39 [five confirmed but city
officials have declared they are winning the battle against the [virus.
The death toll remains at two.
"At this point in time, we feel we've gotten rid of a large part of the
adult mosquito population, but not all of it," said Jerry Hauer, director
of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management [OEM. The outbreak has
centered on the areas of Whitestone and College Point in Queens, but health
officials are also tracking cases in The Bronx and Manhattan.
OEM stepped up its spraying efforts, targeting tire piles that harbor water
and create ideal breeding grounds for the [mosquitoes that carry SLE virus.
The other cases are less severe and are still being investigated. Hauer
encouraged residents to call the OEM toll-free hot line, (888) 663-6692, to
report locations of stagnant water. "When we did an aerial survey
yesterday, we found over 150 swimming pools that had stagnant water in
them," which poses a serious risk for further spread of the disease, he
said. Chemicals to treat pools are available free through the hot line.

[Odd to have swimming pools with stagnant water in them. I thought New
York law indicated that even private pools had to be equipped with
circulator pumps. Things might have changed in the past 45 years but I
can't recall getting out of a New York swimming pool without my eyes
burning from the chlorine. This swimming pool business might be a red
herring. I wish someone knowledgeable about mosquito vectors of SLE virus
would jump into this discussion. Swimming pools, automobile tires...
sounds like the old defoliation mentality. Hasn't anyone mentioned all the
rain the New York City area has had this summer? Are health authorities in
New Jersey, Connecticut, and other nearby states stepping up surveillance?
This virus is moved by birds, so why is just New York City reporting cases?
