The Ministry of Health stated tonight [Mon 23 Jan 2017] that Bahia state has 7 reported yellow fever cases [suspected, locally acquired or imported? - Mod.RNA]. Of these, 1 was confirmed [where? Teixeira de Fretas? Sylvatic? - Mod.RNA], 1 was discarded and the other 5 are under investigation.

Currently, the Bahia state Secretariat of Health [SESAB] stated that there are just 3 suspected cases of the disease registered in the city of Teixeira de Freitas that is located in the south of the state [all locally acquired? An outbreak? - Mod.RNA].

Moreover, in the case totals released by the Ministry of Health there is no record of deaths in Bahia, and those cases were reported in 3 municipalities, though they did not say which ones. The Ministry pointed out that it sent 400 000 extra doses [of vaccine] to Bahia for preventive vaccination of the population in the recommended area.

SESAB also stated that the recommendation included booster vaccinations for the municipality of Vitória da Conquista, a city at an important highway route to the north and northeast of Minas Gerais, where the municipalities with the occurrence of yellow fever cases and deaths are located. The populace of Vitória da Conquista issued a complaint about the lack of vaccine against the disease in the region.

According to the Secretariat, although the road flow is not an indication for population vaccination, due to the daily migratory intensity and the strong health relations between the 2 regions, Vitória da Conquista was included in the list of cities for a selective vaccination intensification.

The other municipalities that must vaccinate 100 percent of their populations are: Angical, Baianópolis, Barra, Barreiras, Bom Jesus da Lapa, Brejolandia, Buritirama, Campo Alegre de Lourdes, Canápolis, Carinhanha, Casa Nova, Catolandia, Cocos, Coribe, Correntina, Cotegipe, Cristópolis, Feira da Mata, Formosa do Rio Preto, Ibotirama, Itaguaçu da Bahia, Iuiú, Jaborandi, Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, Malhada, Mansidao, Morpará, Muquém de Sao Francisco, Paratinga, Pilao Arcado, Remanso, Riachao das Neves, Santa Maria da Vitória, Santa Rita de Cássia, Santana, Sao Desidério, Sao Félix do Coribe, Sento Sé, Serra do Ramalho, Serra Dourada, Sítio do Mato, Sobradinho, Tabocas do Brejo Velho, Wanderley, Xique-Xique.

[Moreover, according to the briefing, last year [2016] 2 deaths were confirmed as sylvan [forest] yellow fever: 1 in April [2016] in the municipality of Bady Bassit (where the probable site of infection is known as "monkey forest"; in the municipality of Sao José do Rio Preto) and another in Ribeirao Preto, also near a forested area. - Mod. RNA, trans. Mod.TY]

[The city of Américo Brasiliense, in the interior of Sao Paulo state, registered the 1st locally acquired yellow fever death in the area, that was laboratory confirmed on [Mon 23 Jan 2017]. (http://g1.globo.com/sp/sao-carlos-regiao/noticia/2017/01/americo-brasiliense-sp-registra-1-morte-por-febre-amarela-na-regiao.html) reported in ProMED-PORT.

Yellow fever cases in humans and monkeys have been popping up in several localities in Brazil over the past few weeks; a worrisome situation due to the risk of initiation of an urban, _Aedes aegypti_ outbreak. So far, all human cases have been reported as spill-over transmission from the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission. These cases are being investigated to determine if any are due to urban, _Aedes aegypti_ transmission. Vaccination campaigns are being focused on the areas where these human and monkey cases have occurred, in a prudent effort to prevent urban transmission.
