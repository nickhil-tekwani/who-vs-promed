16-Year-Old Dies of Rabies in Santa Maria Public
Health Officials Trying to Track Down Traveling Companion
-------------------
Rabies is what killed a 16-year-old in Santa
Maria on Tuesday [18 Mar 2008], and public health
officials are trying to track down a companion
who recently traveled with the teenager from
Mexico. The boy came into the Marian Medical
Center on [18 Mar 2008] delirious and drooling,
and was having trouble breathing. He required
resuscitation immediately, but doctors were not able to save his life.

"If you start showing symptoms," said Dr. Eliot
Schulman, the county's Public Health director,
"it is unusual to survive. That means your brain
is infected, and there is no direct treatment for it."

In the United States, it is extremely rare for
humans to contract rabies, and that's especially
true locally. "The last case in Santa Barbara was
80 years ago," said Schulman, citing a 1927 incident.

There are cases in the United States, said
Schulman, but they usually come from a wild
animal bite; on the West Coast, that usually
means a bat or a skunk while raccoons are usually
the culprits on the East Coast. Domestic animals
very rarely have rabies these days, though within
the past 5 years, rabies detected on a dog
traveling through Santa Barbara County and in a
dead cat that had been bitten by a bat. [The
majority of human cases of rabies in the United
States since 1980 have been associated with the
bat variant rabies virus. According to CDC
statistics 21 of the 36 human cases (58 percent)
since 1980 have been associated with bat variants
(for more details, see
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056176.htm>.)
Cases occurring in other countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin America tend to be associated with canine bites. - Mod.MPP]

Officials believe that the boy contracted the
disease in Mexico, because he had not been in the
United States long enough to have had the disease
take its course. As well, rabies is much more
common in Mexico and Central America. For that
reason, Schulman bets that the culprit was
probably a rabid dog, though future tests by the
state lab in Richmond will eventually determine
what type of animal was responsible. Oddly, they
could not find any bite marks on the victim.

The time from bite to death from rabies is
variable, and depends on where the bite occurs.
If it's closer to the brain, the disease can take
hold rather quickly. However, if caught early,
post-exposure prophylaxis will cure a victim in most cases.

In this case, the 16-year-old's 8 housemates have
been identified and will be treated, even though
casual contact is highly unlikely to spread the
disease. But since direct contact with saliva of
an affected person may pass the disease,
officials are still on the lookout for the
16-year-old's traveling companion, who is
believed to be in either Santa Barbara or Ventura counties.

Santa Maria teenager dies of human rabies
------------------------
Santa Barbara County Public Health Department
officials say a 16-year-old boy died from rabies
on Tuesday [18 Mar 2008]. They say he may have
contracted the disease in Mexico, based on the incubation period.

The young man was admitted to Marian Medical
Center with delirium, hypersalivation and
difficulty swallowing. Officials are looking to
identify people who had close contact with him,
and find a traveling companion who came with him
to Santa Maria from Mexico. These individuals are
advised to get post-exposure prophlylaxis (PEP)
which will prevent them from developing rabies.

It is believed the person traveling with the
young man may be in Ventura County or Santa Barbara County.

Rabies is a viral disease most often contracted
from wild animals. Human to human transmission is
rare, but those who may have come in direct
contact with infected saliva have potential for infection.

There is no risk to the general public and casual
contact with a person infected with rabies will not spread the disease.

The last known case of human rabies in Santa Barbara County was in 1927.

There have been 2 cases affecting domestic pets in the last 8 years.
