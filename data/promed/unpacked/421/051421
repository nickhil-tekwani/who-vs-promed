The monkeypox outbreak illustrates a growing problem: Exotic animals give
exotic diseases to people who get too close, a trend that some medical
specialists call a serious public health threat. Such diseases can become a
threat not just to the people who buy and sell exotic pets, but to the
general public if the diseases spread to native animals and become
established in the United States. Federal health officials are working
frantically to ensure that doesn't happen with monkeypox.
"This is a harbinger of things to come," warns Michael Osterholm of the
University of Minnesota, who advises the government on infectious diseases
-- and has long warned that there's too little oversight of the health
threats of imported animals.
"There are some of us who feel like lone voices in the night" in calling
for better scrutiny, adds Peter Jahrling, a scientist at the U.S. Army
Medical Research Institute [of Infectious Diseases] (USAMRIID). "Perhaps
incidents like this might bring some much-needed re-examinations."
Monkeypox, a relative of smallpox usually found in tropical African
forests, apparently jumped from an imported Gambian giant rat into prairie
dogs when both species were being housed by an exotic pet distributor in
Illinois.
Health officials are investigating nearly 3 dozen possible cases of
monkeypox in people who bought or cared for the prairie dogs in Wisconsin,
Indiana, and Illinois. The outbreak marks the first time monkeypox has been
detected in the Western Hemisphere. Nor is it the only threat, say critics
who fear a growing trend.
SARS, the respiratory epidemic, is thought to have come from civet cats
bred as an exotic meat in Chinese markets where bats, snakes, badgers, and
other animals live in side-by-side cages until they become someone's dinner.
Japan recently banned the importation of prairie dogs because they can
carry plague. The rodents had been wildly popular as pets in that country.
Just last summer, a group of prairie dogs caught in South Dakota was
discovered to have tularemia, a dangerous infection typically spread by the
bites of infected ticks, deerflies, and such or through ingesting
contaminated material. The disease was detected only after the animals were
shipped to 10 other states and 5 other countries. While the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention never recorded any human illness, adults who
handled the ill rodents were advised to take precautionary antibiotics.
Then there's salmonella, which iguanas and other reptiles, as well as
birds, routinely shed in their feces. The CDC counts a stunning 90 000
people a year believed to have caught salmonella from some form of contact
with a reptile, either touching it or touching a surface where the reptile
had tracked the bacteria.
It is a common scenario, Osterholm says: Parents wash the reptile cage in a
bathtub or sink their child uses, and the child gets sick. Salmonella can
be life-threatening in children. Worse is if a disease jumps from exotic
pets into native wildlife -- a threat whenever owners dump an animal that
gets too large or tiresome to care for.
The CDC's Dr. Steve Ostroff made a plea Monday for prairie-dog owners not
to release their animals into the wild, but to call a veterinarian or their
state health department for proper care information. Call ahead before
taking a sick prairie dog to a veterinary clinic to guard against possible
exposure of other animals to monkeypox, he said. A sick prairie dog has
already infected a rabbit who lived in the same house; Jahrling worries
that hamsters and gerbils could be incubating monkeypox from pet-store
transmission; in Africa, squirrels carry the virus.
"Even if we do manage to bring the prairie dog problem under control, it's
very important that we keep our guard up" by watching for monkeypox in
other species, Ostroff said Monday. There are no good counts of how many
exotic animals are sold, but they're immensely popular, says Richard
Farinato, director of the Humane Society of America's captive wildlife
program. Some 800 000 iguanas alone are imported for the pet trade.
There is little federal scrutiny of most imported animals for potential
human health risk, and rules on owning and selling exotic animals vary by
state and city.
"We have a policy that says don't buy these kinds of animals as pets. This
(monkeypox) is one example of why," Farinato says. But even the critics
aren't immune to the lure of exotic pets. Osterholm several years ago let
his teenage son buy an African dwarf hedgehog, another pet fad -- with the
condition that it be tested for disease. Osterholm's laboratory found the
animal harboured 3 strains of salmonella never before seen in Minnesota.
They kept the hedgehog, but "extreme hand washing took place," Osterholm
recalls. "It wasn't that fun."

I believe the article above implicitly supports the inspection of export
animals at departure airports from Europe into the USA.
My hope is that the anomaly of allowing the absence of veterinary inspections
at European departure airports will be addressed at the Second International
Conference on the Transportation of Horses, which will be held at Hartpury
College, Gloucestershire, England on 12-13 Jul 2003. Currently, this serious
omission could allow import into the USA of sick horses and/or horses not fit
to ship in a humane manner. In addition, the welfare of contact horses is
compromised; after all, the USA importers' most important asset is the horse.
Currently, a horse can be imported into the USA with a health certificate
written 30 days ago. This is not acceptable. I have asked that this topic
be addressed at the upcoming US Animal Health meeting. It is on the
Import/Export committee agenda, and I am requesting support for airport
inspection.

[Perhaps part of the issue is what should or should not be a pet -- and in
what type of environment? Perhaps it also involves the understanding that
diseases can pass from people to animals as well as from animals to people;
we should not be so quick to blame every outbreak on animals. Furthermore,
better education regarding personal hygiene and sanitation is called for,
as pointed out in the article. Frequent hand washing and general sanitation
of the area is important for decreasing the risk of disease transmission.
Regarding horses, the ultimate question is: How long is too long? Is 30 days
reasonable to secure the appropriate and necessary paperwork, testing, and
vaccines and handle any difficulties in the transport of the animal(s)? Is
it possibly a case of simply needing to inspect and verify the health of the
animal(s) immediately prior to departure, since all vaccines, testing, etc,
should already have been completed? There is no easy answer regarding
infectious diseases, time lines, and not tightening the regulations to the
point that trade is completely restricted. - Mod.TG]
