[The department of Cesar is located in northern Colombia, bordering to the north with the department of La Guajira, to the east with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, to the west with the department of Magdalena, to the southwest with the Department of Bolivar, and to the south with the departments of North Santander and Santander -- covering a total area of 22 905 square km (about 8844 square miles) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Department.

The department of Cesar is located outside the containment zone as defined by ICA. The information and map of this zone can be found at https://www.ica.gov.co/getattachment/Aftosa/ZONA-DE-CONTENCION-DEL-VIRUS-DE-LA-FIEBRE-AFTOSA.pdf.aspx?lang=es-CO.

The distance between San Diego, Cesar and Sogamoso, Boyaca, where an outbreak of foot and mouth disease virus, serotype O was reported on 1 Oct 2018 (see ProMED posting 20181003.6065836), is about 800 km (500 miles).

The following statement is summarized from an ICA press release reported on 11 Oct 2018:

"According to ICA, the virus from this new outbreak is related to the virus which has been circulating along the border and within the containment zone and reported in 2017 and 2018.

"Maintaining the current containment zone is needed until a detailed analysis of this new situation is made by the international experts from the Pan-American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center (Panaftosa), and the sanitary measures (cleaning and disinfection, stamping out and sentinel placement) are completed," noted the chief of livestock services.

"Minister Valencia Pinzon informed that as an immediate control measure, emergency vaccination is being conducted, which is part of a second vaccination cycle in the departments of Boyaca and Cesar."
