WEST NILE VIRUS, RESEARCH: COMMENTS
***********************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: William J. Barnes <wjb@wjbagency.com>

[1] I believe ProMED-mail reports of birds are confirmed to have West Nile
virus are still useful since they might suggest a transmission mode other
than bird/mosquito. With the advent of cool weather, mosquito activity is
virtually non-existent in the NY area.
[2] West Nile continues to have a significant impact on the economics of
the horse industry. JFK airport is still completely closed for the export
of all horses shipping to the EC. The ban on NJ/NY/CT horses has been
modified to include only horses from certain countries. However, transit is
not allowed in spite of little/no mosquito activity here and in Europe.
Additionally, Brazil and Hong Kong have restricted exports of US horses.
[3] West Nile Virus and the European Community response has disrupted plans
for international horse shows and may affect our Olympic Team
competitiveness in Sidney.
[4] My concern is that now that the initial round appears over, attention
to WNV must wait until next August to be responded to.
[5] The question that needs to be answered/proven is "Are infected horses,
infectious". Due to budgetary and manpower constraints, this question is
not being fully addressed!
[6] Research should actively continue to understand and evaluate this
disease more fully to provide a pre-emptive response prior to next years
outbreak.
[7] If West Nile Virus has tested our ability to response to bio-terrorist
activity involving animal pathogens, we have failed the test.
[8] The veterinary community must develop an infrastructure capable of
identifying and responding to these threats. Veterinarians should be more
aware the vital role they play in protecting the public health.

[Wow! I have numbered Mr. Barnes' paragraphs and comment on them numerically.
[1] Sure, if birds continue to die all winter we will report these
occurrences. However, if a virus is identified in February, from a bird
found dead last October, we will not post that message.
[2] Irrelevant to our reporting anything. The Japanese Racing Association
briefly and intensely considered placing a ban on the importation of horses
from the U.S. but decided not to do so. If the European Community has such
a ban, it must be for economic or political reasons; it could not be for
scientific reasons. They already have WNV in Europe. It is not scientists
who make such decisions, it is politician-administrators.
[4] This maybe Mr. Barnes' concern, but it is groundless. CDC and the
affected states are actively engaged in surveillance for WNV infection of
humans, birds, mosquitoes, aardvarks and whatever else moves. Two weeks
ago CDC sponsored a meeting on WNV attended by people from all interest
groups. They are on top of this problem, let me assure you.
[5] I presume this means "Are infected horses persistently infectious and
capable of serving as a vertebrate host for uninfected mosquitoes." The
U.S.D.A. is on top of this also. They are conducting experimental studies
and surveillance: horses, chickens, and other vertebrates are being
studied. There are no budgetary or manpower constraints that are not being
addressed. This is not an "out of sight, out of mind" situation.
[6] As noted above, federal- and state-sponsored research is active and
vigorous. More dollars would help if they were directed towards hiring
people to lighten the loads of state and federal lab personnel but the
necessary work is being done by competent people.
[7] We have failed nothing. The virus was recognized quickly, identified
soon after that, and appropriate responses made. If it was a bioterrorism
event, it failed. Sure, the virus entered this country and was originally
misdiagnosed but when was the last time you heard of the epidemic incursion
of a human pathogenic virus that made only 60 people sick and killed only a
dozen people?
[8] The veterinary community already has an infrastructure capable of
identifying and responding to threats similar to this one. It was U.S.D.A.
that identified the virus in the first place. As for the suggestion that
veterinarians be more aware of the vital role they play in protecting the
public health, I agree completely. - Mod.CHC]
