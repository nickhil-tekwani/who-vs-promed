New coronavirus-like virus found in bats
----------------------------------------
Viruses closely related to the new coronavirus that emerged last year [2012] in the Middle East have been discovered in specimens from a number of species of bats found widely throughout Europe and beyond, a new study shows.

The work suggests bats common to Europe, Russia, parts of Asia and Africa, and the Middle East may carry viruses that are very closely related to the new coronavirus, called EMC 2012 [the virus has also been referred to as nCoV -- novel coronavirus].

The study will be published in the March [2013] issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

The findings, while interesting, don't help to narrow down how a dozen or more people in 3 countries have been sickened by the new virus, or whether more have been infected but have escaped notice because their symptoms were mild.

The researchers said bats from the Arabian Peninsula should be tested to see if they carry similar viruses. But senior author Dr Christian Drosten cautioned that because of the wide geographic distribution of these bats, it cannot be concluded that the bat virus that evolved into the new coronavirus did so in the Middle East.

"It could have come up in any other region where those bats are prevalent," said Drosten, a coronavirus expert and director of the Institute of Virology at the University of Bonn Medical Centre in Germany.

While it is believed the new virus came from bats, it's not known whether it moved directly from bats to people -- through exposure to bat guano or urine, for instance -- or whether some other animal or animals such as some form of livestock became infected and passed the virus on.

The SARS coronavirus, a cousin of EMC 2012, evolved from a bat virus that made its way into wild animals -- civet cats and raccoon dogs -- that are eaten as delicacies in China. "We don't know (yet) what the raccoon dog is for this virus, but there may be one," Drosten said.

He and colleagues had done previous research on bats in Ghana and in 4 countries in Europe -- the Netherlands, Romania, Germany, and Ukraine. As a result of that earlier work, they had stored fecal samples from nearly 5000 bats. After EMC 2012 emerged, they tested the samples looking for coronaviruses.

They found previously unknown viruses related to the new coronavirus in nearly 25 per cent of _Nycteris_ bats, and 15 per cent of _Pipistrellus_ bats. The viruses from the latter were most closely related to EMC 2012. In one case, the genetic codes differed by less than 2 per cent.

Three of 4 _Pipistrellus_ bat species tested positive for the similar coronaviruses, Drosten said. "The whole Old World region is full of different _Pipistrellus_ species. And I wouldn't be surprised if all of them contain related viruses."

So if these bats commonly carry viruses similar to the new coronavirus and carry them throughout many parts of the world, why have infections only been seen in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Jordan? And why now?

Do the cases -- 9 confirmed plus a similar number of probable cases -- represent multiple introductions of virus from bats to people, like sparks from a fire? Or did the virus jump once and spread, mostly unseen, from person to person?

At present, those questions have no answers. But there are ways to find clues, particularly to the question of whether the virus made multiple jumps from its bat reservoir.

Generating genetic sequences from all the viruses that have infected humans -- where virus has been isolated or virus fragments are available -- would give scientists information to compare.

Each type of virus evolves at a particular rate. The speed is referred to as its molecular clock. Comparing genetic sequences from the 1st known cases to later cases should show if the human viruses have evolved from one another.

The 1st spotted case was a man from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia who died in June [2012]. But in November [2012], a Cairo-based US naval research laboratory confirmed that 2 people who died in Jordan in April 2012 had been infected with the new virus.

"We will never have a definite answer unless we find the source. But we will have very, very clear hints if we sequence more viruses," Drosten said. "The further apart in time, and in geography, those virus sequences are, the more we will learn."

[According to Shalmon's field guide to the land mammals of Israel, the following 5 _Pipistrellus_ bats have been identified in Israel: _P. ariel_, _P. kuhlii_, _P. pipistrellus_, _P. rueppellii_ and _P. savii_.

In Jordan, the following 6 _Pipistrellus_ bats have been recorded: _P. ariel_, _P. kuhlii_, _P. nathusii_, _P. pipistrellus_, _P. pygmaeus_, and _P. rueppellii_ - Mod.AS]

Abstract
--------
"We screened fecal specimens of 4758 bats from Ghana and 272 bats from 4 European countries for betacoronaviruses. Viruses related to the novel human betacoronavirus EMC/2012 were detected in 46 (24.9 percent) of 185 _Nycteris_ bats and 40 (14.7 percent) of 272 _Pipistrellus_ bats. Their genetic relatedness indicated EMC/2012 originated from bats."

The authors mention that "Within the Arabian Peninsula, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (http://www.iucn.org) lists 50 bat species, including _P. arabicus_, _P. ariel_, _P. kuhlii_, _P. pipistrellus_, _P. rueppellii_, and _P. savii_ bats."

The identification of betacoronaviruses related to the nCoV associated with severe acute respiratory infections affecting individuals in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Qatar last year (2012) in several bat species in Ghana and Europe that include bat species found in the Eastern Mediterranean region is not surprising and further supports a hypothesis that the human infections were a result of species jump from bat to humans. What is not known as yet, is whether this species' jump was directly from human contact with infected bat secretions or if there is/was an intermediate host such as livestock in the region that may have been infected through contact with bat secretions, and humans were then infected through contact with the infected animals in the region as mentioned in the above newswire. Results of studies on the animal populations in the region are eagerly awaited. - Mod.MPP]

[A relevant reference on the role of bats as a reservoir for emerging viruses is Calisher CH, Childs JE, Field HE, et al: Bats: important reservoir hosts of emerging viruses. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2006 Jul; 19(3): 531-45 (full article available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1539106/, references available at source URL).

"Bats evolved early and have changed relatively little in comparison with mammals of other taxa (69). Although the fossil record of bat evolution is incomplete, a recent analysis of 17 nuclear genes dated the origin of chiropterans to the Eocene period (52 to 50 million years ago), coincident with a significant rise in global temperature. 3 major microchiropteran lineages were traced to Laurasia and a 4th to Gondwana. The correspondingly ancient origins deduced for certain zoonotic viruses maintained in bats, such as the henipaviruses and lyssaviruses, suggest a long history of cospeciation. Viruses that evolved with bats may have used for replication cellular receptors and biochemical pathways, which are conserved in mammals that evolved later and which underwent radiation in later geological periods. If so, these conserved cellular receptors and pathways could enhance the capacity for transmission of bat-associated viruses to other mammals.

"In 2002, a previously unrecognized coronavirus (family _Coronaviridae_) was found to cause a new, severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans [92, 125). This virus, named SARS-CoV, is a distant relative of the group 2 coronaviruses that infect rodents, cattle, dogs, pigs, and humans and has been assigned to group 2b (58). It is distinct from 2 other coronaviruses recently identified in bats in southern China (84, 119).

"Epidemiologic studies showed that the earliest cases of SARS were associated with the wildlife meat industry. A survey of wildlife in a Shenzhen market recovered SARS-CoV-like viruses from masked palm civets (_Paguma larvata_) and raccoon dogs (_Nyctereutes procyonoides_) and detected antibodies to the SARS-CoV-like virus in a hog badger (_Arctonyx collaris_)(63). Interestingly, the epidemiology of the outbreak in animals in the wildlife meat market resembled that of shipping fever, a viral syndrome that occurs when animals from different farms are comingled under crowded, stressful conditions. Under such circumstances, immune responses to persistent virus infections are reduced, virus shedding is increased, and susceptible animals become infected and shed virus. In the marketplace where SARS-CoVs were detected, viral RNA from some animals that were seronegative was detected by reverse transcription-PCR, suggesting acute infection, while other animals had antibodies to SARS-CoV but continued to shed virus, suggesting persistent infections (63). Although no pathology was associated with SARS-CoV in animals in this market, civets inoculated with human isolates of SARS-CoV had severe lung pathology (156). By sequencing many viral genomes from SARS patients, wild and farmed civets, and other animals, a dendrogram was generated that showed that the 1st human SARS coronaviruses were closely related to a contemporary virus from masked palm civets and that point mutations were selected and accumulated later, as the virus passed from human to human (139).

"Extensive surveys of viruses in domestic animals, poultry, and wildlife were done by reverse transcription-PCR to identify the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV. Palm civets were found to be an incidental host rather than the principal host for SARS-CoV. Recently, several groups simultaneously identified bats from different locations in southern China as being infected with SARS-CoV-like viruses or having antibody to these newly recognized coronaviruses, including members of several species of Chinese horseshoe bats (suborder _Microchiroptera_, family _Rhinolophidae_, genus _Rhinolophus_) (Tables 1 and 2) (42, 84, 86). The prevalence of antibody to bat SARS-CoV in some species of Chinese horseshoe bats was as high as 84 percent. Pathology has not yet been associated with SARS-CoV infection of bats.

"The genomes of SARS-CoV isolates recovered from civets and humans during the 2002-to-2003 outbreak of SARS lay phylogenetically within the broad group of SARS-CoV-like viruses of bats (86). These data show that the virus responsible for the 2002-to-2003 outbreak most likely originated from this group of bat-associated viruses. Antibody against SARS-CoV-like viruses of bats was also detected in Leschenault's rousette (_Rousettus leschenaultia_), a cave-dwelling megachiropteran, suggesting that fruit bats also may support infection with SARS-CoV-like viruses. Thus, the natural history of SARS-CoV appears to involve a previously unrecognized SARS-CoV-like virus of bats being transmitted in meat markets to amplifying hosts, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, and a hog badger, and then spilling over to infect humans in close contact with these intermediate hosts or their tissues. Subsequent human-to-human transmission of the virus was associated with adaptive mutations in the viral genome (139)." - Mod.CP]
