[The Astrakhan region is located in the extreme southeast of the European part
of Russia. The region occupies an area of 44 000 sq km. The Astrakhan region
borders the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Republic of Turkmenistan, and the
Islamic Republic of Iran. Within the Russian Federation the Astrakhan region
borders the Volgograd region and Republic of Kalmykia.
West Nile virus infection of humans and mammals (horses in particular)
throughout its African and Eurasian ranges is sporadic and rare. But
significant outbreaks have occurred, such as the current outbreak in
Astrakhan. An epidemic in Romania involved hundreds of human cases with 17
fatalities, and sporadic West Nile virus cases have been recorded in Israel
over several years. Recently outbreaks have occurred in horses in France and
Italy. West Nile virus-seropositive birds have been recorded in Poland, the
Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. Since the 1st report of the 2005
outbreak in Astrakhan received on 10 Sep 2005, the number of cases has
increased from 60 to 73 and 3 patients have died. - Mod.CP]
