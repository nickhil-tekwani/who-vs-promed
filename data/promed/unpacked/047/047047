A case of strangles has been reported in New York state according to the Equine Disease Communications Center. According to the site: racing officials and the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets have quarantined Barn 19 as a precaution at the Finger Lakes Race Track along with one training stable in Ontario County, New York.

The affected horse became clinically ill on [10 Jul 2018], after leaving Finger Lakes Race Track 2 days earlier. Both quarantined premises have biosecurity procedures in place. Horses in Barn 19 will not be allowed to race until [29 Jul 2018], but will be allowed to train under certain restrictions. If there are any confirmed cases or signs consistent with Strangles found, the quarantine may be extended. Officials will continue to monitor the situation.

According to the Merck Veterinary Manual: Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of the upper respiratory tract of equines. Symptoms include fever and nasal discharge. Abscesses form in the lymph nodes in the horse's neck and throat area. It is caused by _Streptococcus equi equi_ and only affects horses, mules and donkeys, not humans. Strangles is highly contagious although not usually fatal. The incubation period is up to 2 weeks.

[To quote my colleague TG: "This is a very contagious disease capable of spreading quickly and easily. There is a vaccine for this disease and owners should be encouraged to vaccinate their horses. One way to help ensure vaccination is for the [race tracks] to require proof of vaccination within a year or 6 months of the show before the animal can be unloaded at the [race track.]."
