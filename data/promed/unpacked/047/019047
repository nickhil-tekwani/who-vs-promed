[This outbreak appears to be caused by Foot and Mouth Disease
serotype O, not the serotype A reported from Jordan. In Israel, beef
cattle and goats have been implicated. In Jordan, over the last month
[January-February 2007], both cattle and sheep have been infected
with serotype O.
More details on the mode of infection and what the nature of the
introduction of new animals, as well as the nature of the illegal
movement, would be most helpful. Molecular epidemiologic studies and
surveillance to characterize the serotype O isolates from all 3
affected locations would also be helpful. - Mod.PC]
