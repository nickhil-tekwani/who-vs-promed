ref: Relman DA. Opinion: To stop the next pandemic, we need to unravel the origins of COVID-19. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 117(47): 29246-29248. doi: 10.1073/pnas.2021133117. Epub 2020 Nov 3. PMID: 33144498
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We find ourselves 10 months into one of the most catastrophic global health events of our lifetime and, disturbingly, we still do not know how it began. What's even more troubling is that despite the critical importance of this question, efforts to investigate the origins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and of the associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have become mired in politics, poorly supported assumptions and assertions, and incomplete information.

SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus whose apparent closest relatives, RaTG13 and RmYN02, are reported to have been collected from bats in 2013 and 2019, respectively, in Yunnan Province, China (1). COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 more than 1000 miles away in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. Beyond these facts, the "origin story" is missing many key details, including a plausible and suitably detailed recent evolutionary history of the virus, the identity and provenance of its most recent ancestors, and surprisingly, the place, time, and mechanism of transmission of the 1st human infection. Even though a definitive answer may not be forthcoming, and even though an objective analysis requires addressing some uncomfortable possibilities, it is crucial that we pursue this question. Preventing the next pandemic depends on understanding the origins of this one.

There are several potential origin scenarios. 1st, SARS-CoV-2 may have evolved in bats, which are known reservoirs of immense coronavirus diversity (2), and then spread directly, or indirectly via an intermediate host, to humans through natural mechanisms. The degree of anticipated but undiscovered natural diversity clearly lends support to this scenario, as well as support to other scenarios. 2nd, SARS-CoV-2 or a recent ancestor virus may have been collected by humans from a bat or other animal and then brought to a laboratory where it was stored knowingly or unknowingly, propagated and perhaps manipulated genetically to understand its biological properties, and then released accidentally.

Some have argued that a deliberate engineering scenario is unlikely because one would not have had the insight a priori to design the current pandemic virus (3). This argument fails to acknowledge the possibility that 2 or more as yet undisclosed ancestors (that is, more proximal ancestors than RaTG13 and RmYN02) had already been discovered and were being studied in a laboratory -- for example, one with the SARS-CoV-2 backbone and spike protein receptor-binding domain, and the other with the SARS-CoV-2 polybasic furin cleavage site. It would have been a logical next step to wonder about the properties of a recombinant virus and then create it in the laboratory. Alternatively, the complete SARS-CoV-2 sequence could have been recovered from a bat sample and viable virus resurrected from a synthetic genome to study it, before that virus accidentally escaped from the laboratory. The third scenario, seemingly much less likely, involves laboratory manipulation or release, with the clear intention of causing harm.

Even though strong opinions abound, none of these scenarios can be confidently ruled in or ruled out with currently available facts. Just because there are no public reports of more immediate, proximal ancestors in natural hosts, doesn't mean that these ancestors don't exist in natural hosts or that COVID-19 didn't began as a spill over event. Nor does it mean that they have not been recovered and studied, or deliberately recombined in a laboratory.

Why do these distinctions matter? If we find more concrete evidence of a "spill over" event with SARS-CoV-2 passing directly from bat to human, then efforts to understand and manage the bat-human interface need to be significantly strengthened. But if SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab to cause the pandemic, it will become critical to understand the chain of events and prevent this from happening again. Rather than resorting to hunches or finger-pointing, each scenario must be systematically and objectively analyzed using the best available science-based approaches. There is a path to greater clarity. It requires scientific rigor, forensic approaches, deliberate methods, transparency, and cooperation.

In an effort to reveal the origins of the pandemic, researchers so far have focused on the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. However, the sequence of the pandemic virus tells us only so much. 1st, the closest known relatives, RaTG13 and RmYN02, are not that close (4). 2nd, there is probably more than one recent ancestral lineage that contributes to SARS-CoV-2 because its genome shows evidence of recombination between different parental viruses. In nature, recombination is common among coronaviruses. But it's also common in some research laboratories where recombinant engineering is used to study those viruses. The bottom line is simple: We need to identify the immediate parent(s) of SARS-CoV-2, and they're missing.

To find its parents and understand its recent history, we need 1) additional genome sequences of coronaviruses from relevant bats and other suspect hosts -- some of these likely exist already in laboratories, given the efforts so far undertaken to survey bats in particular (2, 5); 2) measurements of SARS-CoV-2 evolution under a variety of defined conditions so that differences between viral genomes can be understood better as differences in time on an evolutionary clock; and 3) data from antibody surveys of humans at high risk of coronavirus exposure and from past cases of similar disease, so that previously unrecognized encounters can be revealed. In addition, we need to address whether there is information about host or environmental samples that contain recent ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, data perhaps not yet publicly available. More generally, are there relevant scientific data, including from coronavirus engineering work in laboratories, that have not been shared widely? Who knew what about relevant viruses and cases of disease before December 2019, and when? This information will go a long way toward clarifying the origins of this pandemic, even if certainty continues to elude us.

The means are just as important as the goals. An investigative process should be transparent, collaborative, international, and, to the extent possible, devoid of political interest. Recent, productive scientific collaborations between the United States and China, for example, provide hope that such a process can be achieved. But the kind of effort required will need to expand far beyond what's taken place so far, and nations other than the United States and China will need to be involved. Conflicts of interest by researchers, administrators, and policymakers on all sides must be revealed and addressed, and all relevant global constituencies must be included. Both the World Health Organization and The Lancet COVID-19 Commission (6) have hinted that they have taken some 1st steps, but their efforts so far have been cloaked in secrecy (7, 8). A deliberative process for investigating the origins of this pandemic must be representative of all relevant disciplines, expertise, and stakeholders; must achieve political neutrality, scientific balance, and access to all relevant information and samples; and must operate with transparency and independent oversight. Without these features, it will not be credible, trustworthy, or effective.

A more complete understanding of the origins of COVID-19 clearly serves the interests of every person in every country on this planet. It will limit further recriminations and diminish the likelihood of conflict; it will lead to more effective responses to this pandemic, as well as efforts to anticipate and prevent the next one. It will also advance our discussions about risky science. And it will do something else: Delineating COVID-19's origin story will help elucidate the nature of our very precarious coexistence within the biosphere.

[Dr Relman has presented a very thought-provoking and solid discussion on the need to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2. He raises the unfortunate situation of the investigations having become mired in politics and the urgent need to have multilateral and multidisciplinary investigations to identify the origin. All with the goal in mind of how to prevent another pandemic spill over. Given the fact that this is the 3rd coronavirus spill over resulting in serious disease to occur in this century (SARS-CoV-(1) in 2002/2003, and MERS-CoV (2012-present), combined with the identification of numerous bat coronaviruses through the years since the SARS-CoV experience, the need to understand the event that led to this pandemic is critical moving forward. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Continuation of placebo vaccine trial recipients discussion
Date: Thu 3 Dec 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/health/covid-vaccine-placebo-group.html


In October [2020], [a couple], volunteered for a coronavirus vaccine trial. At a clinic near their home in Phoenix, each got a jab in the arm. [The husband], a retired physician, became a little fatigued after his shot, and developed redness and swelling on his arm. But [the wife], a social worker, didn't notice any change. "As much as I wanted it, I couldn't find a darned thing," she said. "It was a nothing burger." She knew there was a 50-50 chance that she would get the vaccine, developed by Johnson & Johnson. Judging from her lack of symptoms, she guessed she had received the placebo.

At the time, [the wife] thought that anyone who had received the placebo would get the real vaccine as soon as the trial showed it was safe and effective. She looked forward to the peace of mind it would bring. But last month [November 2020], she was asked to sign a modified consent form indicating that people who got the placebo might have to wait up to 2 years to get the vaccine, if they got one at all. [The wife] found the form vague, confusing and, most of all, unfair. "You put yourself out there with that risk," she said. "I am owed that vaccine."

As state and federal governments prepare to distribute the 1st coronavirus vaccines to healthcare workers and nursing home residents later this month [December 2020], the tens of thousands of people who received placebo shots in trials have become the subject of a thorny debate among experts. Some scientists agree with [the wife] that, if she indeed received a placebo, she should be moved toward the front of the line in exchange for her service for the greater good. "I think probably we owe them, as a consequence of their participation in the trial, some special priority in terms of access to the vaccine," Dr Francis S Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said at a meeting in July [2020].

But on Wednesday [2 Dec 2020], 18 leading vaccine experts -- including a top regulator at the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] -- argued that vaccinating placebo groups early would be disastrous for the integrity of the trials. If all of the volunteers who received placebo shots were to suddenly get vaccinated, scientists would no longer be able to compare the health of those who were vaccinated with those who were not. "If you're going to prioritize people to get vaccinated, the last people you should vaccinate are those who were in a placebo group in a trial," said Richard Peto, a medical statistician at the University of Oxford. Mr Peto and his colleagues laid out their concerns in a new commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2033538, and covered and discussed in COVID-19 update (515): USA ACIP recommendations, Europe schools, WHO, global 20201202.7986672. - Mod.MPP]

Placebos have been essential to clinical trials for decades. It's vital that neither the volunteers nor the staff running the trial know who is randomly assigned to get the vaccine or the placebo. This "blinding," as it's called, eliminates the chance that people will behave differently depending on which treatment they get, potentially skewing the trial's results. Yet the prospect of giving people something useless in the face of a life-threatening disease has always been fraught. Even Jonas Salk balked at the idea of giving people placebos when researchers designed a trial to test his new polio vaccine in 1953. "I would feel that every child who is injected with a placebo and becomes paralyzed will do so at my hands," he complained. The study, Dr Salk declared, "would make Hippocrates turn over in his grave." But Dr Salk lost that fight, and the placebo-controlled trial went forward. It clearly demonstrated that the polio vaccine was safe and effective. Only when the trial was over did the children who received the placebo get the vaccine - along with millions of other children.

Given the stakes of the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has agreed to consider a faster, but limited approval, known as an emergency use authorization, based on early results from clinical trials. The agency said in new vaccine guidelines published in October [2020] that such an authorization would not necessarily be grounds for unblinding a trial.

But the debate is far from over. In an October [2020] statement, Pfizer said that it "would have an ethical responsibility to inform all study participants about the availability of an emergency authorized vaccine." The company said it would propose to the FDA that volunteers who got the placebo could get the real vaccine. Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said this week that its position hadn't changed.

In their new paper in The New England Journal of Medicine, Mr Peto and his colleagues argue that once a placebo group disappears from a clinical trial, the chance to collect rigorous data about a coronavirus vaccine will vanish. Preliminary results don't reveal how long a vaccine's protection will last, for example. It's possible that the immunity provided by a vaccine can fade over the course of months. That decline would lead to an increase in the rate of vaccinated people getting sick as compared with the placebo group. Scientists would most likely see that trend if they can keep a vaccine trial intact. "It is clear that there is early protection, and I suspect there will be protection for quite a long time afterward," Mr Peto said. "But I think that we will be much better as a planet if we get clear evidence of this."

If the companies were to encourage unblinding their trials, that could also harm their chances of receiving the FDA's full stamp of approval -- a license. And allowing a trial to continue may also be good for their bottom line, because knowing when immunity from a vaccine begins to wane will dictate how frequently people will need their product.

Dr Anthony S Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the ethical case for giving the vaccine to people like [the wife mentioned above] was more compelling now that the vaccines had turned out to work surprisingly well. The 2 companies at the front of the US vaccine race, Pfizer and Moderna, both have reported efficacy rates of about 95 percent. It is unlikely that waiting for more volunteers to develop COVID-19 will change that number much. "You put yourself at risk to prove that something works, so that everybody could use it," Dr Fauci said. "When you have efficacy as high as this, the case becomes stronger."

Dr Fauci sketched out one possible way to balance the obligation owed to people who took the placebo against the need for more data from the trials. Vaccine makers could give everyone who got the placebo the vaccine -- while also giving everyone who got the vaccine the placebo. None of the trial participants would know which order they got the doses. The trial could therefore continue to be blinded.

In that scenario, researchers would be able to compare the 2 groups to see if the vaccine's protection faded over time. The newly vaccinated placebo group would still enjoy a strong immune response, while the people originally vaccinated starting in July 2020 might have a weaker one. If both groups remained at low risk of infection, that would show that the vaccine was long-lasting. "In my mind, that's one really good option of fulfilling the ethical constraints at the same time as you get new knowledge," Dr Fauci said.

The issue will likely come to a head on [10 Dec 20200], when an FDA advisory board meets to discuss Pfizer's application for emergency authorization of its COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna, which is just a week behind Pfizer, has yet to settle on a policy for its placebo group. Dr Fauci said that it was likely he, Dr Collins, and other top NIH officials would talk more about the issue with Moderna, whose vaccine was developed in collaboration with researchers at Dr Fauci's institute.

If the FDA authorizes the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, the limited initial supply will likely mean that the shots are slowly rolled out. As new groups of people become eligible, it's possible that the 2 vaccine trials may gradually lose some people in their placebo groups as people drop out to get the authorized vaccines.

The rollout could have a bigger impact on the 2 other late-stage clinical trials underway in the United States, run by Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. Johnson & Johnson expects to get the 1st results from its trial in January or February [2021] -- but that will depend on its placebo group remaining unvaccinated. After learning that it may take 2 years before Johnson & Johnson will provide her with the real vaccine, [the above mentioned wife], who is 68, is considering trying to get Pfizer or Moderna's version as soon as she's eligible thanks to her age. "I'll drop out, which I can do, and I'll get the vaccine," she said.

Holly Janes, a biostatistician at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and her colleagues are preparing for this kind of erosion. She and her colleagues are now working on statistical methods to squeeze the most insight out of the trials no matter what their fate. "It won't be ideal from a purely scientific vantage point, because we lose the direct comparison between vaccine and placebo," she said. "But we're trying to strike a balance between doing what some would argue is right for the participants, and maximizing the public health value that comes out of these trials."

[This article focuses on the realities of clinical trials and the ethical issues raised by them. When you know a drug (or vaccine) under study has a 95% efficacy, is it ethical to withhold it from the placebo recipients? Not an easy discussion.

The example of clinical trial for the polio vaccine is interesting, as it involved a disease that produced paralytic disease in a very small percentage of infected individuals -- an average of 0.5% of those infected (1 of 200 infected), while approximately 25% of total infected individuals have a non-paralytic symptomatic course and the remaining almost 75% of total infected individuals are without any clinical symptoms. This is similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a small percentage of infected individuals with severe disease, a percentage with milder symptoms, and the majority of infected individuals with no clinical symptoms. The Francis Field Trial was the clinical trial of this vaccine and it ran from April to June 1954 (inoculations), with the final serology collection in November 1954, and with data ready for release in the spring of 1955 and the announcement made on 12 Apr 1955. So basically the trial ran for 1 year from start to finish, with the placebo group eligible for receiving the vaccine following the release of the data (see references below). While there are similarities in the diseases (COVID-19 vs polio) in terms of having a low clinical vs non-clinical presentation of infections, the approach to the clinical trials and duration of observation differ greatly -- 1 year vs 3 years as currently proposed. Given the lethality of this disease for those with serious clinical presentations (COVID-19), is 3 years non-protected an ethical approach? A discussion for the ethicists.

That being said, Dr Fauci's suggested compromise approach is intriguing and merits further investigation.

[3] Vaccine supply chain challenges
Date: Thu 3 Dec 2020
Source: The Wall Street Journal [edited]
https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-slashed-its-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-target-after-facing-supply-chain-obstacles-11607027787


When Pfizer Inc. said last month [November 2020] it expects to ship half the COVID-19 vaccines it had originally planned for this year [2020], the decision highlighted the challenges drug makers face in rapidly building supply chains to meet the high demand.

"Scaling up the raw material supply chain took longer than expected," a company spokeswoman said. "And it's important to highlight that the outcome of the clinical trial was somewhat later than the initial projection."

Pfizer still expects to roll out more than a billion doses in 2021 as originally planned. Pfizer and Germany-based partner BioNTech SE had hoped to roll out 100 million vaccines worldwide by the end of this year [2020], a plan that has now been reduced to 50 million. The UK on Wednesday [2 Dec 2020] granted emergency-use authorization for the vaccine, becoming the 1st Western country to start administering doses.

The 2-shot vaccine also is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration in the US, where a similar authorization could come later this month [December 2020] and a rollout before the end of the year. The US regulator also is considering a vaccine developed by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. that could begin shipping before Christmas [25 Dec 2020].

The doses are among an array of vaccines that have been developed this year as the coronavirus pandemic has raged across much of the world. Authorities estimate nearly 1.5 million people world-wide have died from the virus, including 273 836 in the US as of [2 Dec 2020].

Pfizer had its 100-million dose goal in place until mid-November [2020], when it became clear the supply-chain hurdles were too great for the end-of-the-year [2020] timeline. "We were late," said a person directly involved in the development of the Pfizer vaccine. "Some early batches of the raw materials failed to meet the standards. We fixed it, but ran out of time to meet this year's projected shipments." Pfizer sources its raw materials from providers in the US and Europe. Scaling up production of these components proved challenging last month [November 2020] as the company awaited the results of its trials, which came in to be 95% effective and well-tolerated in a 44 000-subject trial.

Pfizer wouldn't say where shortfalls over ingredients arose as it ramped up production. Vaccines typically contain materials from suppliers that can include antivirus agents, antiseptic liquids, sterile water, and elements of the DNA of the virus itself that won't cause serious symptoms but trigger the immune system to make antibodies. In a typical vaccination campaign, pharmaceutical companies would wait until their product is approved before buying raw materials, establishing manufacturing lines and setting up supply chains to ship a vaccine. Pfizer has never manufactured a vaccine with technology that uses mRNA, the molecular couriers that carry genetic instructions to cells in the human body, so it has had to scale up production capacity even as research was still under way.

"For this one, everything happened simultaneously," the person familiar with the Pfizer development said. "We started setting up the supply chain in March [2020], while the vaccine was still being developed. That's totally unprecedented." Pfizer and BioNTech are now on track to roll out 1.3 billion vaccines in 2021 and the 50 million dose shortfall this year [2020] will be covered as production ramps up.

The company is setting up what it has described as its biggest ever vaccination campaign through 2 final assembly and distribution centers in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and Puurs, Belgium, which will handle the European supply.

The UK authorization marks a milestone in the effort to develop a promising new vaccine technology into a widely available shot in record time. The UK ordered 40 million Pfizer doses, enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The government said in November [2020] that it could get up to 10 million doses this year [2020], but the expectation now is that 4 to 5 million vaccines will be shipped. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the shots will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made at Pfizer's Belgium plant. Some 800 000 are due in the coming days and "several millions" throughout December [2020], he said.

The US government has placed an initial order for 100 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, with the option to purchase 500 million additional doses. The EU ordered 200 million doses with an option for another 100 million. Japan ordered 120 million doses, and countries in South America and in the Asia-Pacific region also have placed significant orders.

[The challenges with the supply chain are not too surprising as gearing up for mass production was being done simultaneous with the phase 3 vaccine trials -- a potentially financial risky endeavor. Returning to the analogy provided in the NY Times article in section [2] above, the rapid roll out of the IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) following presentation of the final results was associated with what is known as the Cutter Incident, where live virus rather than inactivated virus was released as IPV leading to 40 000 cases of "abortive polio", 51 recipients with paralytic polio, and 5 deaths. An epidemic of polio resulted leading to 113 paralytic cases in family and friends of the vaccinees and 5 died (see references below). A lesson learned about rapid mass vaccine production. Fortunately Pfizer identified problems in supplies it received and did not use in production of vaccine.

- The South East Asia region reported 8.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.9 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 82% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, Poland has crossed the 1 million cumulative case count making it the 7th European country to do so. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis. Korea continues to report more than 500 new cases daily.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 3 Dec 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (221 255), Brazil (50 866), India (38 309), and Turkey (32 381) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 508 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (2-3 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India, Turkey, Russia (28 145), Italy (23 219), Germany (22 910), UK (14 878), Poland (14 863), Ukraine (14 496), Iran (13 922), France (12 696), Spain (11 058), and Mexico (11 030). A total of 63 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 34 of the 63 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region. Noteworthy was the addition of Belize for the 1st time, reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days (603 728) and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 3.8%, while daily reported deaths (10 584) have increased by 2.7%. The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (9.2%) and reported deaths (18.3%) which may still be a function of the weekend decreased reporting. The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 183 789 and newly reported deaths is 1896. The USA has reported more than 200 000 new cases daily over the past 2 days, and today (3 Dec 2020) represented almost 1/3 of all newly reported cases (32.1%).

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 650 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission -- it is now one week post-Thanksgiving Day [26 Nov 2020] and the expected increase in cases due to travel and gatherings may be beginning. Poland and Iran have both now reported more than 1 million cumulative cases. - Mod.MPP]
