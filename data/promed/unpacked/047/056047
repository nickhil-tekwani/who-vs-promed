[1] Intranasal attenuated COVID vaccine on a flu backbone
Date: 11 Sep 2020

https://www.foxnews.com/health/china-approves-human-trials-for-nasal-spray-coronavirus-vaccine


China has approved the 1st phase of human trials for a potential COVID-19 vaccine administered through a nasal spray. The inoculation is being developed by researchers at Xiamen University, Hong Kong University, and vaccine maker Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy Enterprise, according to Bloomberg News.

This is the 10th such candidate from China to proceed to the crucial stage of human testing.

The spray contains strains of the weakened flu virus with genetic segments of the coronavirus's spike protein. Once in the body, it mimics the natural infection of respiratory viruses to stimulate the body's immune response against the pathogen that causes COVID-19, Science and Technology Daily reports. The paper is affiliated with China's Ministry of Science and Technology.

The hope is that a vaccine sprayed through the nose may have a better chance of stopping the virus in the respiratory tracts, while a shot may not be strong enough to stave off infection.

A study published last month [August 2020] by researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis concluded that a nasal vaccine prevented infection in mice -- significantly reducing lung damage -- and that the spray was more successful in fending off the virus.

Intranasal sprays are already employed to prevent the flu, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has highlighted their usefulness.

The World Health Organization reports that at least 35 coronavirus vaccine trials are currently underway across the globe.

A major study conducted by pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, however, paused this week after researchers said a participant reported a "potentially unexplained illness."

In the wake of AstraZeneca's setback, China's own developers -- CanSino Biologics Inc. and state-owned China National Biotec Group Co. -- have reassured consumers about the safety of their own shots.

None of the Chinese diplomats traveling to virus hot spots overseas have reported infections months after receiving CNBG vaccines, their general counsel told Science and Technology Daily.

According to MarketWatch, there are 7 vaccine candidates that have moved into clinical trials with human participants, including 3 that have moved into a crucial development phase.

[The primary goal of a COVID-19 vaccine is to keep people from getting very sick and dying. But there's another goal -- to prevent the spread of the disease -- and it's not clear whether most vaccine candidates currently under development can do that.

Use of a vaccine delivered through the nasal route offers the advantages of triggering local immunity that occurs primarily in the cells that line the nose and throat, easier to administer, but there are restrictions that apply to use of attenuated vaccines versus killed ones.

There are other nasal vaccines that are being developed for SARS-CoV2, such as the results reported in mice by Hassan et al in August 2020; the team evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a pre-fusion stabilized spike protein in challenge studies with SARS-CoV-2. They report that "Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal IgA and T cell responses, and virtually completely prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts;" [https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31068-0].

The exciting thing is the sheer amount of collaborative research that is being conducted to contain the pandemic and the speed with which the solutions are being sought globally. - Mod.UBA]

- 12:40 GMT - German national boxing team infected with coronavirus.
The entire German national amateur boxing team has been infected with coronavirus at a training camp in Austria.

The infection affects 18 athletes as well as 7 coaches and supervisors, sporting director Michael Mueller told the DPA news agency after Der Spiegel news magazine had 1st reported it.

"Fortunately, there are no serious cases. Some had mild symptoms such as sore throat while others felt nothing," Mueller said.

- 12:20 GMT - Expert says UK "on edge of losing control" of virus outbreak.
As infection numbers surge in the United Kingdom, a leading health expert warned that the country is on the verge of losing control of the outbreak.

The UK recorded more than 3500 new infections within a day on Friday [11 Sep 2020], the highest level since mid-May 2020.

"I think one would have to say that we're on the edge of losing control," Mark Walport of the UKRI, a research institute, told the BBC.

- 10:25 GMT - UAE reports 1007 new cases, highest since outbreak
The United Arab Emirates reported 1007 new cases of the coronavirus, its highest daily number since the pandemic broke out. The country conducted more than 95 000 tests and registered one death and 521 recoveries.

Until last month [August 2020], there had been a generally falling trend after the UAE's new daily cases peaked to 994 in May 2020, but numbers have surged from 164 cases on 3 Aug 2020.

- 10:00 GMT - Hungary daily cases near 1000, schools to stay open
Hungary's daily new coronavirus cases reached a record 916, by far the highest since the onset of the pandemic as schools reopened and strict measures that helped contain the pandemic in the spring have yet to be reinstated.

Even as cases rise, the number of people dying from the disease has remained fairly low, with 2 elderly patients with chronic pre-existing conditions dying from complications of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours.

The government's coronavirus task force said active cases reached 7134, but Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who attended a session of the task force early on Saturday [12 Sep 2020], said schools can stay open and life must go on.

- 09:50 GMT - Taiwan plans to sign up for COVAX vaccine allocation scheme
Taiwan will sign up to the COVAX global vaccine allocation plan to ensure it will be able to access a COVID-19 vaccine when one becomes available, the island's health minister said.

Chen Shih-chung told reporters in Taipei that the government had engaged lawyers to enter discussions about signing onto the scheme. Taiwan is also researching its own vaccine, a process Chen said was going smoothly.

The World Health Organization (WHO) and the GAVI vaccine alliance are leading the COVAX facility, aimed at helping buy and fairly distribute vaccination shots against the novel coronavirus around the world.

- 08:45 GMT - Indonesia reports 3806 new coronavirus cases
Indonesia has reported 3806 new coronavirus infections and 106 deaths, data from the health ministry website has shown.

Saturday [12 Sep 2020] marked the 5th consecutive day that Indonesia registered daily infections of more than 3000, bringing the total number of cases to 214 746.

Total COVID-19 deaths rose to 8650, the highest in Southeast Asia.

- 08:40 GMT - Philippines reports 186 more coronavirus deaths, record daily toll
The Philippine health ministry reported 186 more deaths related to the novel coronavirus, a new daily record and the highest single-day fatality rate recorded so far in Southeast Asia.

In a bulletin, the ministry said total deaths have increased to 4292, while confirmed cases rose by 4935 to 257 863. The Philippines has the most COVID-19 infections in the region.

- 08:35 GMT - Spanish princess quarantined after classmate diagnosed with COVID-19
Princess Leonor, the heir to the Spanish throne, has gone into quarantine after a classmate at her school tested positive for COVID-19, the royal household said.

The 14-year-old daughter of King Felipe will be tested for coronavirus like other pupils in her class at the Santa Maria de los Rosales school in Madrid.

The king and Queen Letizia will continue their royal duties for the moment, a spokesman for the royal household said, as Spain struggles to control a surge in coronavirus cases.

- 07:20 GMT - Czech Republic reports record one-day rise in new cases
The Czech Republic reported its largest one-day rise so far in new coronavirus infections, recording 1447 cases, according to health ministry data. The country has seen one of the biggest spikes in cases among European countries in recent weeks.

It tightened restrictions on mask-wearing this week, although it aims to avoid bringing back measures that would hurt businesses.

- 07:10 GMT - Crowds rally in New Zealand's Auckland against lockdown
Large crowds rallied in Auckland against the government's social distancing restrictions imposed on the country's largest city after an outbreak of the novel coronavirus last month [August 2020].

Local television footage showed tightly packed crowds, with many people not wearing masks, with estimates of the attendance varying in reports between a thousand and a few thousand people.

"We are all here today because we believe we need to stand up for our rights," the public Television New Zealand cited Jami-Lee Ross, the leader of the Advance New Zealand party, one of the organisers of the protest, as saying.

- 05:23 GMT - India reports record daily jump for 2nd straight day
India reported a record daily jump in coronavirus cases for a 2nd consecutive day, logging 97 570 new infections, according to data from the federal health ministry.

With total cases of more than 4.65 million, India is the world's 2nd-worst affected country, trailing only the United States, which has more than 6.4 million cases.

But the growth in infections in India is faster than anywhere else in the world, with cases surging through urban and rural areas of some large, populous states.

- 04:10 GMT - Australia coronavirus deaths pass 800
Deaths related to the novel coronavirus in Australia reached 803, but new daily infections in the country's largest hotspot of Victoria continued to fall.

Victoria state reported 6 new deaths related to the coronavirus over the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 716, or more than 90 percent of all deaths in Australia.

However, new cases in the country's 2nd-most populous state continued to fall from a peak of more than 700 in a single day in early August 2020. It reported 37 new cases on Saturday [12 Sep 2020], its lowest since late June 2020.

- 02:24 GMT - Canada reports zero COVID-19 deaths for 1st time since March 2020.
Canada reported zero COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours for the 1st time since 15 Mar 2020, according to public health agency data.

Canada's death toll from the pandemic stood at 9163 as of 11 Sep 2020, the same as the number of the deaths reported on 10 Sep 2020, government data showed. The number of positive cases rose by 702 to 135 626 on 11 Sep 2020 from the previous day, the data showed.

- 01:09 GMT - Mexico tops 70 000 COVID-19 deaths
The confirmed coronavirus death toll in Mexico has surpassed 70 000 after the government reported 534 new deaths in the past 24 hours.

Making matters worse, excess mortality data from mid-March through early August 2020 indicate that the total number of deaths beyond the official count is likely tens of thousands higher.

Mexico also reported 5935 new infections, bring its total caseload to 658 299.

- 00:35 GMT - UN General Assembly calls for solidarity to overcome pandemic
The United Nations General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a resolution on tackling COVID-19, calling for "intensified international cooperation and solidarity to contain, mitigate and overcome the pandemic."

The resolution, adopted by a vote of 169-2, also urged member states "to enable all countries to have unhindered timely access to quality, safe, efficacious and affordable diagnosis, therapeutics, medicines and vaccines."

The resolution, which is not legally binding, was approved over objections from the US and Israel, which protested against a successful last-minute Cuban amendment that strongly urges countries to oppose unilateral economic, financial or trade sanctions.

- 00:01 GMT - England's coronavirus cases double every week
A study of coronavirus infection in England showed that the epidemic is doubling every 7 to 8 days, with an increase in positive cases in all age groups below the age of 65.

The finding came in a study of more than 150 000 volunteers, who were tested between 22 Aug 2020 and 7 Sep 2020, by Imperial College London and polling firm Ipsos MORI.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the pandemic is "not over, and everyone has a role to play to keep the virus at bay."

Separately, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, which advises the UK government, said the virus's reproduction rate is now between 1.0 and 1.2, meaning anyone with the virus is infecting, on average, a little more than one other person.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (94 409), followed by the USA (39 282) and Brazil (31 880) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.4%) and 58.1% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4983 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (11-12 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Spain (0), Argentina (10 776), France (10 561), Colombia (6876), Peru (6162), Mexico (5935), and Russia (5488), and 29 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Five of the top 10 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region. Spain reported the 4th highest daily cases globally on 11 Sep 2020, but the case numbers over the last 24 hours have not been reported.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a decrease in case counts by 1.1%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.2%.

Impression: Cases are increasing globally, with Europe showing major increasing transmission in many countries. - Mod.UBA]
