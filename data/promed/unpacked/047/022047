According to state health officials, the 35-year-old rancher who
died (15 Aug 1999) after cleaning his mobile home near Labarge,
Wyoming probably had had a hantavirus infection. The state is
waiting for additional laboratory test results but an initial blood test
and autopsy indicate a strong likelihood the man died of [Sin
Nombre virus]. He was hospitalized in Kemmerer on 14 Aug and
died the next day, after being transferred to a Salt Lake City [Utah]
hospital.

[This is the first hantavirus infection recognized in Wyoming in 6
years.
The report goes on to say that 8% of the state's deer mice are
infected with "hantavirus", i.e., Sin Nombre virus. However, it
continues by saying that "chipmunks, voles, and other mice carry
various forms of the disease" in Yellowstone Park. As far as I
know, no hantavirus has been isolated from a chipmunk. We have
tested more than 200 chipmunks and have never had a
seropositive. (Anyway, rodents do not carry the disease, they
carry the virus that can cause the disease. No less dangerous,
however; no more, either). - Mod.CHC]
