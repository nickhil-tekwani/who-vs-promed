A horse on the Gold Coast hinterland [Queensland] has been euthanised after testing positive to the deadly Hendra virus; 7 people have also been assessed after coming into contact with the horse.

The equine death is the 4th Hendra virus diagnosis in Queensland this year [2013] and follows a case in the Brisbane Valley last month [June 2013].

Queensland chief veterinary officer Dr Rick Symons said there was only one horse on the Gold Coast property, but the area was under quarantine to address the environmental contamination risk.

"Tracing and risk assessments are being undertaken on any animals that have been on or off the property, as well as any neighbouring animals that may have had contact with the infected horse," he said. The horse had not been vaccinated.

Acting chief health officer Dr Stephen Lambert said vaccination was the most effective way to reduce the Hendra virus risk.

"It is recommended that horse owners speak to their veterinarian about the option of vaccinating their horse against Hendra virus," he said.

A 4th horse has died from Hendra virus at Kempsey on the New South Wales mid-north coast. The horse was on a property at Dondingalong near Kempsey when it became seriously ill on Monday [8 Jul 2013] and failed to respond to antibiotics. The 13-year-old quarter horse died on Tuesday [9 Jul 2013] and tests have confirmed it was infected with Hendra virus.

The state's Acting Chief Veterinarian, Dr Therese Wright, says she does not believe the death is directly linked to 3 other horse deaths at Kempsey and Macksville in the past month.

"I don't believe that they are linked by any human or animal movement," she said. "We believe that they're probably all a result of contact with flying foxes [fruit bats] that have been in flowering or fruiting trees on the properties." [Meaning contact with their excreta or secretions on fallen fruit. - Mod.JW]

Dr Wright says vaccination is the best prevention. "Vaccination is the single most effective way of preventing your horse from getting the Hendra virus," she said.

"You should also try and keep your horse out of paddocks with flowering or fruiting trees, and if your horse is sick it's really important that you protect yourself."

The Department of Primary Industries says a 2nd horse on the property is being quarantined.

The local public health unit is assessing the risk to people who came into contact with the infected horse.

Authorities say Hendra vaccination rates remain low and they are calling on all horse owners to have their animals immunised.

NSW Health Director of Communicable Diseases Dr Vicky Sheppeard says people who have contact with sick horses should take precautions. "Horse blood, nose, and lung secretions and urine can all carry the virus and put people who come in contact with them at risk," she said in a statement.

"Human treatments for Hendra virus remain experimental, so avoidance of exposure to the virus is the safest course of action."

[Neither of these articles leads us to believe that people are in grave danger, but nevertheless we hope for a good outcome for them. Likewise, we hope the other exposed horses do not succumb to this disease.

Vaccination is the single best way to build a barrier against this disease. Protect your horse, and therefore protect yourself.

Keeping horses from fruit trees that may attract the bats is another important measure, but it must be used in combination with vaccination.
