First Report of Plectosporium Blight on Pumpkin Caused by _Plectosporium
tabacinum_ in Alabama.
-----------------
J. M. Mullen and E. J. Sikora, Department of Entomology and Plant
Pathology, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849. Plant Dis. 87:749, 2003;
published on-line as D-2003- 0416-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication 6
April 2003.
In October of 2001, _Plectosporium tabacinum_ [Pt] (van Beyma) M.E. Palm,
W. Gams, & H.I. Nirenberg (formerly _Microdochium tabacinum_ (von Arx,
1984) and _Fusarium tabacinum_ (Gams & Gerlagh, 1968) was observed in field
plantings of pumpkin (_Cucurbita pepo_ L.) in Cullman and Jackson counties
in north Alabama.
Symptoms were white or tan, spindle-shaped lesions on stems and
leafpetioles and slightly raised, corky, white or light brown lesions on
pumpkin fruit and fruit stems. Pumpkin symptoms were identical to a
previous description of Pt (published as _M. tabacinum_) on pumpkin,
zucchini, and yellow summer squash (1).
Disease severity ranged from less than 10 percent stem tissue damage on
pumpkins in Cullman County to 40 to 45 percent stem tissue damage on
pumpkins in Jackson County. A field section of pumpkins in Jackson County
sprayed with the fungicides azoxystrobin (0.20 kg a.i./ha) and
chlorothalonil (2.44 kg a.i./ha), alternated weekly beginning at vine-run,
had stem damage of approximately 5 percent compared to ca. 45 percent stem
damage on pumpkins in an unsprayed field section.
A 50 percent reduction in marketable fruit due to Pt was observed in the
unsprayed field section compared to the section sprayed weekly with fungicides.
Thin slices of lesions, taken from stem and fruit surfaces and examined
microscopically, showed 1- or 2-celled, hyaline, bilaterally symmetric
spores, 7.0 to 8.5 × 2.8 to 3.0 micrometers. The ends of the spores were
slightly narrowed and rounded. Spore characteristics were identical to
previous descriptions of Pt produced in culture and on diseased pumpkins
and squash (2,3).
Surface-sterilized tissue from fruit lesion margins was plated on PDA and
incubated under light (Sylvania Gro-Lux, 40w) with a light/dark cycle of 12
h at 23°C. After 10 days, spores were observed that were similar to those
from fruit except that they were multiguttulate and had a phialide
arrangement. The fungal mycelium was pale pink to pale orange and closely
appressed to the agar. Fungal characteristics in culture agree with a
previous description of Pt in culture (2).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of Pt in Alabama.

[Plectosporium blight primarily infects pumpkin, yellow squash and zucchini
squash. Apparently there are no resistant cultivars and crop losses can
exceed 50 percent. Disease management depends upon crop rotation with
non-cucurbit crops and the use of chemical fungicides containing
chlorothalonil or trifloxystrobin. -Mod.DH]
