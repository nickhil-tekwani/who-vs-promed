Hokianga measles outbreak sparks vaccination reminder
-----------------------------------------------------
Parents are being urged to ensure their children are vaccinated
against measles after confirmation of a large outbreak in Northland.
The Northland District Health Board says of 30 patients believed to
have measles in the Hokianga area, 5 have been confirmed.

Measles is a potentially serious, highly infectious disease that can
make children sick for one to 2 weeks with high fever, hacking cough,
red eyes, a running nose and rash.

Medical officer of health Jonathan Jarman says the affected European
community is quite isolated and normally does not have a lot to do
with traditional health services.

"Our immediate concern is that the virus is going to spread into the
wider Hokianga community and to other parts of New Zealand," Dr
Jarman says. He urges caregivers to check their children have been
vaccinated against measles, with 2 injections giving 99 percent
protection from the disease.

Because measles is a severe illness it is also important for
caregivers to get medical advice if their children become sick.

[According to a report in Northern News, the people involved are
reported to be supporters of peace activist Sam Land who was recently
found not guilty of damaging the Waihopai spy base
(<http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/northland/local-news/northern-news/3542120/Measles-jabs-urged>).

Medical officer of health Jonathan Jarman said the outbreak appears
to be confined to the family group and their close associates. "The
affected Pakeha community is quite isolated and normally does not
have a lot to do with traditional health services," says Dr Jarman.

It seems likely that this group because of their philosophic
convictions have declined vaccination and have been at risk of
measles virus infection. The source of their infection, presumably
somewhere in the general community, remains to be established.
Further information would be welcomed.
