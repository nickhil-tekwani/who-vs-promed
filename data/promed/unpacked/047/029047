An outbreak of lumpy skin disease [LSD] in Rajasthan has resulted in the death of more than 1200 bovines, with districts in western Rajasthan being the most affected, said state Animal Husbandry department officials Saturday [30 Jul 2022].

Officials said that the disease, which results in rashes on the skin of bovines and is highly contagious, was first noticed [in Rajasthan] in April this year [2022] but has spread to multiple districts in the past few weeks, affecting 25 000 bovines.

"The outbreak started from Jaisalmer and then spread to Jodhpur, Nagaur, Jalore, Hanumangarh, Bikaner, and Sri Ganganagar. The disease was first noticed sporadically in April, but due to its contagious nature is rapidly spreading. Lumpy skin disease results from a virus. Around 20 000-25 000 bovines have been affected so far, and around 1200 bovines have died," said Arvind Jaitly, deputy director (Disease Control), Animal Husbandry Department.

[India officially reported its 1st outbreaks of LSD in November 2019. The 1st 3 outbreaks were in Orissa, affecting cattle, with an apparent morbidity rate of 7.1% and no mortality. Subsequent newspaper and anecdotal reports suggest that LSD has since swept through several northern and central Indian states, affecting hundreds of thousands of cattle. ProMED's postings have already addressed LSD events in the provinces of Odisha, Kerala, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Assam, and -- most recently -- Gujarat. The above information about the disease in India's state of Rajasthan, reportedly circulating there since April 2022, is not surprising. Rajasthan borders the Pakistani provinces of Punjab to the northwest and Sindh to the west, known to be LSD affected for at least 7 months, as well as 2 LSD-stricken states, namely Madhya Pradesh (affected since August 2020) and Gujarat. Rajasthan is the largest Indian state by area and the 7th largest by population.

Uncontrolled livestock movement in India, combined with the presence of a range of competent arthropod vectors, may have contributed to a wide, yet to be recorded, LSD circulation elsewhere in India. An official update of the LSD situation, including information on the confirmed number of diseased and dead animals in each of the affected states, is expected.

To minimise the number of outbreaks and the heavy losses afflicted upon India's livestock industry, high LSD vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels is required.
