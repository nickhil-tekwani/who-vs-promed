I have a comment about the moderator's comment about the potato rust news.
>[Most fungal rust species have several spore forms which appear in a
definite progression.
This statement seems to me slightly misleading when we look at the most
important rust diseases in major food crops. Of course, the complete life
cycle of black stem rust (_Puccinia graminis_ f.sp. _tritici_) is
classically shown in most pathology textbooks to exemplify the complexity
of the rust life cycle. Moreover, several rusts
attacking timber and fruit trees also have an alternate host.
Anyway, this complex cycle is not a prerequisite for successful epidemics
in several rusts. Black stem rust is a long-lasting problem in Australia,
where the alternating host (_Berberis_ sp.) and therefore sexual
reproduction is not known. Major rusts in groundnut (_P. arachidis_), soya
bean (_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_), beans (_Uromyces
appendiculatus_), wheat (_P.striiformis_, stripe rust), coffee (_Hemileia
vastatrix_), sugarcane (_P. melanocepahala_ & _P. kuehnii_), flax
(_Melampsora lini_) do not have any known sexual reproduction. Others may
have a sexual reproduction, but its importance is unknown (the wheat leaf
rust, _P. recondita_ f.sp. _tritici_)
So it would be misleading to guess that potato rust is a minor pathogen
because it lacks sexual reproduction, or to consider areas where the
alternating host is absent to be protected from the risk of rust
introduction. Such possibilities were not evoked in the referred post, but
readers unaware of the complexity of rusts might think about them.
Especially the botanical term "microcyclic" may induce the false idea of
little influence.
I came to these comments by thinking about my own perception of the animal
and human disease posts in ProMED-mail. I draw very often straightforward
but totally erroneous conclusions and the moderator's basic comments are of
great value to clarify things. I take the opportunity to thank all the
moderators for their great pedagogical job.

[I appreciate Ivan Sache's comments, and his points are well taken. My
comment about microcyclic fungi was not intended to indicate that such
fungal pathogens are of inconsequential pathological significance. I
merely intended to provide a comparison of spore stages. Ivan's examples
of microcyclic rusts are an excellent reminder of the complexity of rust
fungi. Other examples of microcyclic or demicyclic rust fungi can be found
in Australia (_Uromyces alyxia var. australensis_ on _Alyxia ruscifolia_)
and in Hawaii (_U. alyxia_ on _A. oliviformis_ [maile, _Puccinia
rutainsulara_ on _Melicope anisata_ [mokihana, and _Atelocauda koae_ on
_Acacia koa_). - Mod.DH
