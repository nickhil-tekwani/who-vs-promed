Despite rigid biosecurity measures throughout north Queensland banana farms, the dreaded Panama tropical race 4 is spreading within the infested farms. Since the initial detection [in Queensland; ProMED-mail post 20150305.3208525] in 2015, there have been 3 farms with confirmed cases of TR4; however, the number of plants infected within those farms has increased to nearly 60, up from the initial 9 cases. On the infected properties, TR4 has spread more than 12 km [about 7.5 mi] and moved both uphill and upriver.

Dr Rosie Godwin, ABGC [Australian Banana Growers' Council], urges growers to maintain biosecurity. "When the rate of TR4 spread becomes exponential, it will be much more difficult to deal with," [she] said. "Surveillance and early destruction of infested plants is slowing the spread. Keeping inoculum levels low helps to reduce the risk of spread by uncontrollable means such as floods or wildlife. This disease is not going away, but we can continue to do our best."

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostems; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania. In recent years, tropical race 4 (TR4) has been reported in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and, most recently, from the Americas (ProMED-mail post 20190820.6630576). It is of great concern worldwide, and development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries.

In Australia, race 1 and temperate race 4 are present in parts of the country (ProMED-mail posts 20081212.3908 and 20071024.3451). TR4 was reported for the 1st time in 1997 in the Northern Territory. When a new TR4 outbreak occurred there in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120817.1248624), it was concluded that quarantine restrictions had no effect, and they were lifted. This increased the risk posed by TR4 to the eastern growing areas, but a source for the outbreak in Queensland has so far not been clarified.
