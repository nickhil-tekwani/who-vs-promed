President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered the Department of Health
(DOH) to assist local government units (LGUs) in attending to the
anthrax cases in Cagayan as they investigate how the disease spread
after it has already downed 400 persons and killed one victim.

Deputy Presidential Spokesman Gary Olivar said the President also
directed the Department of Agriculture (DA) to assess the extent of
the anthrax problem [and] its effect on animals. Olivar added that,
at present, anthrax is endemic in Lasam in Cagayan and the nearby
areas. He added that initial reports showed that the anthrax was
found in soil "as spores and herbivores like carabaos get sick from it."

He said Lasam had reported that there are at least 405 suspected
cases of anthrax. "The DOH team is now investigating the outbreaks.
Initial reports traced the source from sick and dying carabaos,
possibly from anthrax. Person-to-person transmission is rare.
Quarantine of cases is not required. Treatment is with
ciprofloxacin," Olivar said, quoting a DOH report.

Cagayan provincial health chief Dr. Danilo Alnozo said of the 400
cases they are handling, only 13 remain under observation at the
Cagayan Valley Medical Center, while one person died of a heart
attack which was aggravated by anthrax.

The victims reportedly got the disease after eating the meat of a dead carabao.

[When the president is on your tail, things happen, and folk lose
sleep. It will be interesting to see what comes of this presidential
push. Anthrax has long been a problem on the island of Luzon, and
common sense would suggest that a programme of active veterinary
surveillance and control would be cost effective. Livestock anthrax
control is something with double benefits; effective control can
result in eradication at no extra cost. - Mod MHJ]
