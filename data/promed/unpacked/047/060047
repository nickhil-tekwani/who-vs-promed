2001/058 Particle lengths of whitefly-transmitted criniviruses
-----------------------------------
Improved measurement methods have allowed some particle lengths of the
following whitefly-transmitted criniviruses to be published:
Abutilon yellows crinivirus: 800 to 850 nm
Cucurbit yellow stunting disorder crinivirus (EPPO Alert List): 750 to 800 nm
Lettuce chlorosis crinivirus (EPPO Alert List): 800 to 850 nm
Lettuce infectious chlorosis crinivirus (EPPO A1 quarantine pest): 700 to
750 nm
Tomato chlorosis crinivirus (EPPO Alert List): 800 to 850 nm
Tomato infectious chlorosis crinivirus ( EPPO Alert List): 850 to 900 nm

[The gist of this paper is that by subjecting these viruses to the same
preparation and measuring conditions, better estimates of virion lengths
were obtained. The whitefly-transmitted, bipartite criniviruses are shorter
than the aphid-transmitted, monopartite closteroviruses. Based on the data,
the authors suggest that Abutilon yellows and Lettuce chlorosis might be
members of the genus Crinivirus. Another virus, Beet pseudo-yellows
(600-850 nm), which occurs in low titer in infected plants, may also be a
crinivirus, based on the measurement of a limited number of virions. - Mod.DH
