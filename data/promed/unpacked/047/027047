Vets fear the recent spate of deaths [attributed to] pimelea in the south west may have actually been caused by anthrax and are warning all producers in the affected Maranoa and Balonne area to burn all carcases as a precaution.

Speaking publicly for the first time since three major anthrax incidences at St George and Dirranbandi, local vet Libby Price, who was first on the scene of each case, questioned if some deaths put down to pimelea should have been further investigated. "I've been here 16 years and I wonder now if a lot of the deaths being put down to pimelea over the years, there may be other factors that we haven't picked up," she said. "It's certainly more prevalent than what we are aware."

Ms Price was one of four guest speakers at the AgForce St George Anthrax Workshop aimed at educating producers on the often forgotten bacteria. In March last year, 120 head of cattle died from anthrax on a St George property following soil disturbance caused by grading.

[Plants in the genus _Pimelea_, commonly known as rice flowers, belong to the family Thymelaeaceae. There are about 150 species, including 110 in Australia and 36 in New Zealand https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimelea.

Pimelea poisoning affects cattle, sheep and horses; however it is potentially fatal for cattle. It is commonest in south-west Queensland, north-west New South Wales and northern South Australia. It is also known as St George disease, Marree disease, 'big-head' and flaxseed poisoning.

Pimelea poisoning is caused by ingestion of toxic varieties of the plant _pimelea_ (native rice-flower, poverty week) and in some cases inhalation of plant dust can also cause poisoning.

Conditions when pimelea poisoning in cattle is likely to occur: light red, sandy, less fertile soils, particularly in overgrazed pastures and old cultivation paddocks; pastures with obvious bare areas without vigorous perennial grass; between August and January; in years when a relatively dry summer is followed by early light winter rain and a dry spring; bulls and breeding cows.

Identifying and diagnosing pimelea poisoning:
Pimelea poisoning can be either acute or chronic.
1. Acute poisoning is caused by consumption of green plants, resulting in severe, life-threatening diarrhoea. Cattle, sheep and horses can be affected.
2. Chronic poisoning occurs in cattle. It is cause by on-going consumption or inhalation of dry plant material.

Clinical signs that would lead a producer to suspect pimelea poisoning include the following: chronic diarrhoea; loss of condition; poor appetite; rough coat; depression; prominent jugular veins in the neck; oedema (soft swelling) of the head, brisket and abdomen; increased respiration rate; heart rate can be heard from a distance; reluctance to move; sudden death, commonly during exertion.

Prevention and control of pimelea poisoning requires careful monitoring of cattle during high risk seasons and grazing management strategies to minimise contact between susceptible stock and pimelea plants. Despite extensive research, there is no effective vaccine or antidote for _pimelea_ poisoning.

I am not going to argue with my Australian colleagues who are conversant with both problems. Sudden death is noted with pimelea poisoning, which is the prime characteristic of livestock anthrax cases. And during major outbreaks in herds animals with clinical anthrax will be seen to be sick before they collapse and die. Some recover. In my experience for every cow that dies, 10 will later be found to have raised anthrax titres, at far higher titres than are seen in vaccinated stock. And if this will encourage them to vaccinate their Queensland stock, so much the better. - Mod.MHJ
