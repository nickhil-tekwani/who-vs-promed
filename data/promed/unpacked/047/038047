Russia: HFRS Outbreak in Orenburg Region is Approaching Crisis Point
-----------------------------------------------
The hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) disease situation in
the Orenburg region is approaching a crisis point. Sergey Kajkov, the
Head Physician of the City Infectious Diseases Hospital, stated that
the situation is 10 times worse than in 2004. There has been a marked
increase in the number of patients admitted to the hospital with a
diagnosis of HFRS, and 2 fatalities have been recorded already. There
have been no unusual features in the progression of disease in the
HFRS patients, but in the majority of cases, illness takes a severe
course. As of Wed 9 Nov 2005, 4 patients have been moved to the
resuscitation unit. Since September 2005, 200 persons with HFRS have
received treatment in the infectious diseases department of the
hospital. During that period, there has been only a single vacant bed
for patients with HFRS. As it is unlikely that the flow of patients
will decline in the near future, additional beds are being made
available.
