KINSHASA, Congo
An outbreak of monkeypox has killed 30 people in the eastern Kasai province
of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). According to the World Health
Organization, monkeypox is transmitted to humans by either monkeys or
squirrels.
Commenting on the outbreak, the DRC health minister, Sondji Jean Baptiste,
said the epidemic was less intense than the Ebola haemorrhagic fever that
hit Kikwit, Bandundu
province, in mid 1995. That fever killed 232 of the 296 people infected.
Sonji said his ministry had sent medical teams to the area [in an effort
to prevent it from spreading elsewhere in the country.
Last week, the government created a disaster prevention fund to deal with
such outbreaks and other natural disasters.

[This report also made reference to 500 cases of paralytic disease that
were said to be associated with this outbreak of monkeypox. We are unaware
of an association of paralysis with human monkeypox. Perhaps someone
closer to this outbreak who has more experience with the manifestations of
this disease in humans could enlighten us. -Mod.CHC
