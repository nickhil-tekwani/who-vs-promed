An Oregon prison canceled weekend visiting hours because about a third of
the inmates got sick. Spokeswoman Julie Martin says state health officials
are trying to identify the cause of the disease at Shutter Creek
Correctional Institution at North Bend. This minimum-security prison houses
nearly 250 inmates.

The symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Martin says only a
handful of prison employees are sick. Prison officials also canceled
outside inmate work crews Monday [5 Nov 2007].

[Outbreaks of sudden onset acute gastroenteritis are frequently caused by
norovirus infection. Such outbreaks are self-limiting and of short duration
with no serious sequelae. Closed communities such as prisons, hostels, care
homes, and schools, where the occupants are housed at high density are
particularly vulnerable. Further information and confirmation of the
presumptive diagnosis would be welcomed.
