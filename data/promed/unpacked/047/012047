Anthrax is spreading in southern Kyrgyzstan, where upwards of 24 cases have
been registered over the past few months, health officials said on
Wednesday. Epidemiologists in the south of the former Soviet republic
reported that in September and October 2005 alone some 25 cases of anthrax
were registered in the 2 southern provinces of Osh and Jalal-Abad,
describing recent months as some of the worst over the past few years in
terms of the disease dynamics.
The serious infection was detected in 4 districts of the provinces and in
Osh city, the capital of the province with the same name, while the
condition of one infected patient at the intensive care unit in Osh
remained serious.
Quarantine has been introduced in the 4 districts and cattle markets were
closed down as well, while veterinary control officials were going from
household to household in the villages, where infection was detected in
order to find cattle not vaccinated against infectious diseases and
vaccinate them. "Despite our numerous warnings about the creeping threat
[of anthrax], some residents, particularly cattle owners and butchers,
continued to ignore veterinary control measures," Artykbai Eraliev, deputy
head of the provincial sanitary and epidemiological control department,
said on Wednesday in Osh.
"The source of the [human] disease is the consumption of infected animals'
meat. The cutaneous [skin] form of the disease can easily be treated, while
in other cases it is not easy to save the patient," Jura Umurzakov, a
doctor at the Osh provincial hospital, explained. Anthrax can occur in 3
forms: cutaneous (skin), inhalational, and gastrointestinal.
A butcher in Osh, currently undergoing treatment at the provincial hospital
after contracting the disease, conceded to doctors that before the
beginning of Ramadan -- the traditional season of weddings in the region --
he was slaughtering several bulls and sheep every day. "I don't know how
many infected animals I slaughtered," he said.
Local officials told IRIN that poor veterinary control in cattle markets
was also contributing to the problem. Vet experts point to inadequate
cattle breeding practices and lack of resources, when farmers do not
vaccinate their animals to avoid extra costs. They also urged the local
population to be vigilant and purchase only good-quality meat, staying away
from cheap meat of suspicious quality.
However, experts cite places where infected animals were buried in the past
as the major cause of the problem. There are more than 550 such spots in
southern Kyrgyzstan, while only 350 of them had been detected, registered,
fenced and covered with concrete to prevent infection. [Somewhat different
numbers are quoted in (02), - Mod.MHJ] But the majority of these spots
remained unattended. "There are no warning signs and local people do not
know that those are dangerous areas and continue to graze their cattle
there," Kadyraly Samiev, a farmer from the Kara-Suu district, said casually.
Meanwhile, 4 residents from Kara-Suu district have been charged with
deliberately selling the meat of an animal infected with anthrax. If found
guilty, the unscrupulous sellers would face a hefty fine and are likely to
pay damages to the 11 infected locals as well. The case is the 1st in the
Central Asian state of charging people with propagating anthrax.

[Thanks to Dr. Asankadyr Junushov, D/ Biotechnology Institute of the
National Academy of Sciences of Kyrgyzstan, Bishtek, the regional breakdown
of 2005 human cases is as follows: North Kyrgyzstan (Chui Valley) one;
Southern Kyrgyzstan, Jalalabad oblast (14), Osh oblast (13). Most have been
due to exposure to contaminated beef. That this recent increase in human
cases is ascribed to the extra demand for meat during Ramadan has logic.
However, the livestock disease is more common in the hot summer months, so
what we are apparently seeing is an increased incidence in humans due to
customs and an insistence on butchering sick animals, all riding on the
owners' reluctance to routinely vaccinate their stock. The true background
incidence in livestock is very probably less than that seen during the
summer. - Mod.MHJ]
