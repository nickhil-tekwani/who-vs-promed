As of Mon 2 Apr 2007, the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population

infection. The cases have been confirmed by the Egyptian Central
Public Health Laboratory and by the US Naval Medical Research Unit
No. 3 (NAMRU3).
The 1st case, a 4-year-old boy from Qena Governorate, is the brother
of the 6-year-old girl whose infection was reported on 28 Mar 2007.
He developed symptoms on 26 Mar 2007 and was admitted to hospital on
29 Mar 2007. The 2nd case, a 7-year-old boy from Sohag Governorate,
developed symptoms on 26 Mar 2007 and was hospitalized on 29 Mar
2007. The 3rd case is a 4-year-old girl from Qalubiea Governorate.
She developed symptoms on 29 Mar 2007 and was admitted to hospital
the following day.
All 3 children are receiving treatment and remain in stable

history of contact with dead birds in each case. Contacts of the
children are under surveillance, and all remain healthy.
Of the 32 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 13 have been fatal.
