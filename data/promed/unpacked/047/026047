Pest attack makes aman prospect bleak
-------------------------------------
Aman paddy [rice] fields in 5 northern districts have been affected by
massive pest attack. Agriculture officials apprehend that the
production may fall short of the target by around 5 lakh [500 000]
tonnes in the 5 northern districts.

Fields have been attacked by leaf blight disease and pests including
brown plant hopper. Pesticides available in markets are ineffective
in controlling the disease and pest attack, farmers said, as they are
adulterated. The disease and pest attack, which started about 2 weeks
ago, have by now affected about 192 240 hectares [475 035 acres] in
the districts of Dinajpur, Nilphamari, Joypurhat, Thakurgaon, and
Panchagarh.

Vast areas of aman (lowland rice) fields have been attacked by pest
and diseases also in Gaibandha. The fields are turning yellowish and
the affected areas are increasing day-by-day, farmers and DAE
[Department of Agricultural Extension] officials said. By now, fields
in 17 unions in Gobindaganj Upazila have been affected. Agriculture
Officers said the pest attack increased this year [2008] due to
'untimely rain'.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ and has been reported from Asia, northern
Australia, Africa, and the USA. The pathogen causes yellowing and
drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and reduces yield. Yield
losses of up to 60 percent have been reported in Asia. The bacterium
is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed-borne, and it is
spread mainly by windblown rain and mechanical means. Disease
management includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer
rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural
measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilisers), and use of
resistant crop varieties. For more information on BLB please see
previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.

The types of rice grown in the region are 'aman' (lowland rice grown
June to November), 'boro' (irrigated, cold-tolerant, cultivated
during winter), and 'aus' (rainfed lowland or upland rice, broadcast
and transplanted March to September). BLB affecting boro production
was reported earlier this year (2008). Recent outbreaks of BLB have
also been reported from India.

Brown planthoppers (_Nilaparvata lugens_) are one of the worst pests
of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region. They are also
the vector of _Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV) and _Rice grassy stunt
virus_ (RGSV), which can cause severe crop losses. Epidemics of these
viruses are usually associated with high vector numbers (more
information via ProMED-mail post no. 20080322.1093, see below).
Furthermore, leaf damage by insect activities also increases the risk
of bacterial and fungal crop infections.
