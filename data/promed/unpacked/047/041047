2004/093 1st records of Citrus leprosis virus in Costa Rica and Guatemala,
and development of a PCR detection method
Leprosis, caused by Citrus leprosis virus (CiLV - EPPO A1 list), is
considered as one of the most important citrus diseases in Brazil. So far,
3 mite species have been demonstrated to transmit the disease, _Brevipalpus
phoenicis_, _B. californicus_, and _B. obovatus_ (_Acari: _Tenuipalpidae_).
In addition to Brazil, the disease occurs in other South American countries
and it was recently identified in Central America in Panama, Costa Rica*
and Guatemala*. In Brazil, studies were made on the diagnosis of CiLV. A
specific RT-PCR method using 2 pairs of primers was developed and was found
accurate, rapid and reliable.
* New geographical records according to the EPPO Secretariat.

[CiLV is a rhabdovirus that has not been assigned to a specific genus.
CiLV-infected plants show localized chlorotic lesions with necrotic rings
in leaves, depressed chlorotic or brownish fruits and lesions in the bark
and stems. Fruit drop often occurs and heavy infection can lead to death of
trees. The disease is considered as one of the most important citrus
diseases in Brazil, causing millions of dollar in damage annually to the
citrus industries of Argentina, Brazil, Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela.
CiLV has been moving northward since 1941 and poses a serious threat to the
billion-dollar U.S. citrus industry. The newly developed PCR procedure will
certainly facilitate rapid detection of CiLV. Disease management depends
upon application of miticides and pruning infected branches from trees. The
major production cost with citrus in Brazil is miticide applications.
Current research in Venezuela suggests that CiLV may be pass through
nurseries, with leaf lesions developing after the budlings have been
planted into the field.
