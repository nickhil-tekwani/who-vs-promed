The food at a church potluck that is suspected of killing 1 person and sending 28 others to the hospital is now being described by health officials as the cause of a "botulism outbreak".

The Ohio Department of Health reported 20 confirmed botulism cases and 9 still suspected on Friday afternoon, 24 Apr 2015. The number of suspected cases has risen daily since the outbreak [linked to the potluck event on] Sun, 19 Apr 2015, at the Cross Pointe Free Will Baptist Church. The cases that were confirmed on Fri, 24 Apr 2015, also include the death of Rushville resident.

ODH [Ohio Department of Health] spokeswoman Cassie Bala said investigators are still narrowing down the contaminated food source, but the preliminary lab results point to 3 dishes in particular: "We have 6 food specimens that are preliminary positive," she said. The positive food specimens are 4 potato salad samples, a spaghetti pasta salad sample, and a macaroni and cheese sample. Bala reiterated that the results are preliminary and that there is a chance of cross-contamination because the food items were found and collected from trash bins.

[The total number of now-confirmed and still-suspected cases has again risen slightly, and preliminary positives on certain food samples have been found. With an attack rate of about 50 per cent of those attending, a food diary from the event may be helpful as well.

The product used in the treatment of these patients, heptavalent botulinum antitoxin (HBAT), is derived from "despeciated" equine IgG antibodies, which have had the Fc portion cleaved off, leaving the F(ab')2 portions, which decreases the risk of hypersensitivity to the equine-derived protein. It is active against 7 botulinum toxins, A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Almost all human cases of botulism are types A, B, and E. The type in this outbreak has not yet been stated.

Confirmation of botulism requires identification of toxin in the blood, gastric contents, or feces of the patient. Although isolated cases of botulism can be confused with other neurological syndromes, a cluster such as this one is likely to be nothing but botulism. - Mod.LL
