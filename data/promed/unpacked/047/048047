As many as 81 false killer whales have died after stranding themselves off the South Florida coast. The United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] announced the grim news on [Mon 16 Sep 2017] afternoon.

NOAA initially reported that 95 false killer whales were stranded in South Florida. Then on [Mon 16 Sep 2017] afternoon, NOAA Fish Southeast tweeted that 81 whales had died and also said the whales were at a remote location off of Hog Key in the Everglades. One whale was seen alive and 13 others are unaccounted for, NOAA Fish Southeast said.

The National Park Service has closed the area around the whale stranding location. They are asking that aircraft should not fly over the area and that boats stay away from the area.

NOAA is responding to the massive stranding, which was first discovered on [Sat 14 Jan 2017] afternoon. Many other agencies are helping with the response effort including the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, NOAA Fisheries, Mote Marine Laboratory, the University of Florida, the US Coast Guard and the US Geological Survey.

False killer whales are large members of the dolphin family. They weigh about 1500 pounds [about 680kg] and are 15 to 20 feet [5-6 metres] long, according to NOAA Fisheries. They are usually found in groups of 10 to 20. False killer whales are known to strand in large groups.

False killer whales are found in Hawaii, along the entire west coast of the US and from the Mid-Atlantic coastal states and southward, according to NOAA Fisheries.

[Mass strandings of cetaceans are considered to be due to a complex set of variables in which behavioral factors are probably important. In these phenomena, there are interactions of physical conditions (weather, tides, currents, coastline) and biological conditions (predators, feeding, disturbance of echolocation and disease), and they are also affected by red tide toxins.
