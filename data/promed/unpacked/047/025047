Abstract
--------
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent of the neurodegenerative amyloid diseases and is characterized by accumulation of amyloid-beta and tau. Recent studies have indicated that AD may be a brain infection. Although AD has not been shown to be transmissible, the burning issue is whether the potential infectious causes are the misfolded amyloid proteins themselves, or an unidentified microorganism. The idea of a replicating protein (prion) evolved from research on the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) represented by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [CJD] in humans. Prions are now suspect in all of the amyloid related neurodegenerative diseases. However, the popularized prion theory is controversial since there is convincing evidence that spiroplasma, a wall-less prokaryote, is involved in the pathogenesis of TSE, and may represent the trigger mechanism. Interest in bacterial involvement in AD has surfaced from discovery that most bacteria produce biofilm and that components of the biofilm experimentally induce misfolded amyloid proteins. The recent discovery of _Helicobacter pylori_ in AD has brought this controversy to a head. In this review we will discuss involvement of bacteria as candidate causal agent/s for the neurodegenerative diseases, and relate the evidence to involvement of spiroplasma in the pathogenesis of the TSEs as a model for these neurodegenerative diseases.

[This is a stimulating review, well referenced, and easy to read, though maybe challenging to some. To quote the Conclusion:

"This review presents a major cross-road for research on AD and PD, and care must be taken to avoid the pitfalls of past research efforts on CJD and the animal TSEs. Failure to consider alternate theories in investigations of the TSEs has hindered progress in the TSE field. Our pioneer work shows a role for spiroplasma in the pathogenesis of the TSEs. We propose that spiroplasma acts as a trigger in TSE, while the prion amyloid is the byproduct of the infection. The prion amyloid may be the toxic element that causes the neurodegeneration in TSEs, but is unlikely to be the cause. This controversy is important for the future research direction in other potentially infectious neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Reports of involvement of conventional viruses or bacteria in neurodegenerative diseases must be investigated since such associations may be useful for developing future diagnostic tests and treatment regimens. It is remarkable that curli fibers in bacterial biofilms are capable of misfolding host proteins, and the accumulation of alphasynuclein in tissue cultures infected with spiroplasma is a prime example. These experimental data provide further avenues of investigations in the neurodegenerative diseases. Of practical importance in the spiroplasmosis model is the localization of the infection to the eyes with development of retinal degeneration. It is noteworthy that similar eye involvement is seen in naturally occurring TSEs and in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD suggesting that a thorough eye examination be done on any patient presenting with dementia." - Mod.MHJ

Abstract [edited]
The spiroplasmas are mollicutes characterized by motility and helical morphology. They were discovered through studies on corn stunt and citrus stubborn diseases. The stubborn agent was the first mollicute of plant origin to be obtained in culture and the first cultured mollicute to possess a helical morphology. The citrus pathogen has been known as Spiroplasma citri since 1973. The corn stunt agent was cultured in 1975 and fully characterized as Spiroplasma kunkelii by 1986. The 3rd and only other phytopathogenic spiroplasma is S. phoeniceum, cultured from naturally infected periwinkle plants in Syria and described in 1986. These 3 spiroplasmas are restricted to the phloem sievetubes of the infected plants and are transmitted from plant by various phloem feeding leafhopper vectors in which the spiroplasmas multiply. Following the pioneering work on S. citri and S. kunkelii, close to 50 other spiroplasma species or proposed species have been discovered.

All spiroplasmas have been isolated from insects, ticks and plants. Insects are particularly rich sources of spiroplasmas. Some insect-derived spiroplasmas are entomopathogens. S. melliferum and S. apis are honey bee pathogens. They cross the insect-gut barrier and reach the hemolymph, where they multiply abundantly and kill the bee. S. floricola is the agent of lethargy disease of Melolontha melolontha (cockchafer). S. poulsonii infects the neotropical species of Drosophila, is transmitted transovarially and kills the male progeny of an infected female fly, hence the name "sex ratio spiroplasma".

Of the 3 known tick spiroplasmas, only S. mirum obtained from rabbit ticks is pathogenic to the vertebrate animal (chick embryo, new-born rodents, adult rabbits), but only upon experimental inoculation of the spiroplasma. Strain SMCA induces high incidence of cataracts in new- born rodents. With strain GT-48 no cataracts are observed, but fatal encephalitis occurs. Spiral membranous inclusions resembling spiroplasmas have been seen in brain biopsies taken from patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. However, failure to detect spiroplasmas by serology and culture points to the absence of spiroplasmal involvement in spongiform encephalopathies.
