AVIAN INFLUENZA (156) - SPAIN

A great crested grebe (_Podiceps cristatus_) is not a duck, is not from the
same zoological family as ducks, and is not even from the same zoological
order (_Podicipediforms_ here, while ducks belong to the _anseriforms_ order).
The age class of the bird is also important, as crested grebes are not
migratory. The species is found over a large part of the Old World, but
they are mostly resident. Like many other waterbirds, they will just move
in winter when their pools freeze. Grebes are fish-eating. Most of the
birds of Spain should be considered resident. So, if this one was born this
spring, it could not have acquired the virus anywhere else than locally, so
the virus must have been brought in through a true migratory species
earlier this spring.
In terms of interpretation of the epidemiological consequences of this
finding, when confirmed, it should be understood that finding a virus
strain in an adult duck (_anseriform_) is different from finding a virus
strain in a fledgling grebe, for instance. For that, a correct
identification of both virus strain and host bird species is strongly needed.
We faced the same difficulties here in France earlier in 2006.

[Dr Moutou's refers to the following data, included in EU press release
IP/06/969 of 7 Jul 2006 which was copied in posting 20060710.1894:
"...tests have confirmed the presence of the highly pathogenic avian
influenza virus H5N1 in a wild duck (of the _pociceps_ [sic] species) found
dead in a wetland in the province of Alava in the Basque Country".
Indeed, the bird found infected was, reportedly, neither a duck nor "of the
_pociceps_ [sic] species" but a crested grebe, as apparent from the earlier
posting 20060707.1862.
Dr Moutou's further comments about the possible epidemiological
implications of the identity of the infected bird fall in line with views
laid out in the earlier posting and specifically with Birdlife's views
(item [5]), underlining the need for more detailed information regarding
the age and sub-species of the bird. - Mod.AS]
