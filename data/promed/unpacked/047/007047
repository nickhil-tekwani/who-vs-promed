[The aetiological agent of crayfish plague is _Aphanomyces astaci_, a member of a group of organisms commonly known as the water moulds. Although long regarded to be fungi, this group, the Oomycetida, are now considered protists and are classified with diatoms and brown algae in a group called the Stramenopiles or Chromista.

For the above and additional background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, Chapter 2.2.1 Crayfish plague (_Aphanomyces astaci_), at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.2.01_CRAYFISH_PLAGUE.pdf.

OIE's internationally agreed upon requirements pertaining to crayfish plague (_Aphanomyces astaci_) are spelled out in chapter 9.1 of OIE's Aquatic Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.9.1.htm. According to the information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist, 102 of 178 OIE Member Countries have provided some information related to crayfish plague (this information is based on the most recent 6-monthly report sent by the countries). Of these 102 countries, the disease was reported as "never occurred" in 77, "absent" in 22, "suspected" in one (Denmark), and as "demonstrated clinical disease" in 2 (Finland and Czech Republic).
