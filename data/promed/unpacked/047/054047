Dozens of cattle have been slaughtered, barns have been toppled and burned
and bans have been placed on meat imports. It's reminiscent of the scare in
Europe over mad cow disease (BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), but in
Asia the new fears stem from an older and better-known cattle contagion -
Foot-and-Mouth disease (FMD).
The trouble started last week, when cows on 7 farms 30 miles northeast of
Seoul developed fever and blisters [vesicles in the mouth, the telltale
symptoms of the disease. [Other vesicular diseases have those same clinical
signs. Hence, the importance of determining if this disease is FMD. - Mod.TG
Since then, farmers have killed off herds suspected of the highly
contagious infection, and importers were quickly slapping restrictions on
foreign food. South Korea, the hardest hit country, announced it will
slaughter 350,000 head of cattle within a 12-mile radius of Paju, the focus
of the outbreak. So far, 105 head of cattle there have been slaughtered,
the movement of all cattle and pigs in the area has been prohibited and
barns housing the diseased animals were burned.
"We are taking strong quarantine measures," said South Korean Deputy
Agriculture and Forestry Kim Dong-keun. "The government wants to tell the
people it's safe to consume the meat ... now on the market." Seoul had
earlier said it has successfully contained the spread of the disease.
Meanwhile, 13 head of cattle on 2 farms in southern Japan were slaughtered
after some of them showed symptoms. Officials have not confirmed whether
FMD is the culprit.
The response by importers was swift. Japan and South Korea quickly banned
imports of each other's beef, followed by similar restrictions in
Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Australia.
Unlike BSE, which is believed to cause a brain-wasting ailment in humans,
FMD cannot be passed on to consumers. BSE outbreak in Britain led to a
global ban on exports of British beef, largely over fears a variation of
the disease could be transmitted to humans. But FMD can ruin beef and milk
cow herds. The virus causes fever and blisters on the feet and mouths,
sapping the animals' appetite and causing weight loss and possibly death.
The disease is a major concern for big meat producers like Australia, which
sold $788 million in beef to Japan last year.
"The Australian authorities must take action to ensure Australian
agriculture is not at risk," Australian Agriculture Minister Warren Truss said.
In an effort to reassure the public, Kim and other top Korean government
officials held a public meat-tasting event. "We will declare the region is
clean within the next 6 months," Kim said.
The slaughtering will continue for 2 months, and the government will launch
a massive fumigation and cleanup operation in the region, he said. The
whole project will cost $90 million, Kim said.
The last outbreak of FMD in Asia occurred in Taiwan in 1997, when ranchers
were forced to destroy 3.6 million pigs, or more than 80 percent of the
nation's hog population. It isn't clear when Taiwan will be able to resume
exporting pork, because it takes up to 10 years to get rid of the disease.
Japan's last case of FMD disease was in 1908.
The bans will likely have little effect on either consuming or exporting
countries because Japan's and South Korea's beef exports are small. Japan,
for example, exported just 300 tons of beef in 1999, a fraction of the 1.05
million tons the United States shipped overseas during the year.

South Korea said a vesicular disease detected Tuesday among livestock in a
northern province has been contained. Kim Sung-hoon, minister of the
Agriculture and Forestry Ministry, said there were no further reported
cases within a 20-kilometer radius of Paju, Kyonggi province, where the
epidemic started. The disease, which causes blisters on the mouth and feet
of livestock, has killed dozens of livestock in Paju, which is located very
close to the Demarcation Line.
"All livestock from the area have been quarantined and over 100 pigs from
infected farms have been killed and buried," the minister said.
Some 78,000 heads of cattle, pigs and deer have been quarantined in areas
within a 10-kilometer radius from the place where the first case was
detected. Meanwhile, the government started buying pork on Wednesday to
stabilize the market after Japan and China's Taiwan province suspended
import of livestock and meat from South Korea.
After outbreak of the disease, South Korea established an emergency
headquarters to prevent a further spread of the disease to south of the Han
River.
