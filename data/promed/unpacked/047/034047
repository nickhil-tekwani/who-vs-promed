[The major BTV-4 epizootic on the Greek islands adjacent to Turkey's mainland and in Rodos, is characterised by extreme pathogenicity in sheep (apparent case fatality rate exceeding 90 percent), while the reported apparent morbidity rate, in the susceptible, unvaccinated sheep population, is -- reportedly -- rather low, namely less than 10 percent. It may be assumed that mild or non-fatal clinical cases have not been noticed/reported, contributing to the apparent exceptionally high mortality statistics.

No cases in goats seem to have been reported from the mixed sheep and goat farms. The appearance of clinical cases in goats in a single goat flock on the island of Kos, with more than 90 percent mortality, is rather exceptional. BTV-4 has been seen in the past almost exclusively in sheep; cases in goats and cattle were regarded as exceptional.

The prohibition of vaccination (of sheep) against such a fatal disease deserves to be explained.

It will be surprising if no circulation of the same virus has taken place during the same period on Turkey's adjacent mainland. BTV-4 has recently been reported from other east-Mediterranean territories, namely Israel; this virus may have probably been also behind outbreaks in the West Bank (Palestinian Authority), from where it was officially reported to the OIE with serotyping pending. - Mod.AS
