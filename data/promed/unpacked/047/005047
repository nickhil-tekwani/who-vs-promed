Botulism outbreak in Sarasota County, Sep 1999
----------------------------------------------
On 11 Sep 1999 the Sarasota County Health Department was informed that a
mother and daughter, ages 79 and 52, had been admitted to Sarasota Memorial
Hospital with neurological symptoms suggestive of botulism. Their symptoms
had come on over 13 hours and included nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting,
blurred/double vision, difficulty in swallowing, speaking, and breathing,
muscle weakness, dizziness, tightness in chest, ptosis (drooping of the
upper eyelid), and paralysis.
The patients had shared a meal on 8 Sep 1999 that included roasted chicken,
baked stuffed potato, garden salad (lettuce, tomato, green onions,
mushrooms) with home prepared dressing, home-bottled garlic-infused oil and
soy milk. The daughter's husband, aged 52, had also attended this meal, but
eaten shrimp, potato, salad and oil from the home-bottled garlic as salad
dressing. He developed symptoms on 10 Sep 1999. The emergency room observed
the husband for 18 hours and sent him home with mild symptoms. On 12 Sep
1999, the husband returned to the emergency room and was admitted to the
hospital. His symptoms included blurred/double vision, dysphonia, fatigue,
and ptosis. The 3 patients received botulism antitoxin from Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The Sarasota County Health Department and the Bureau of Environmental
Epidemiology initiated an investigation. The hospital collected serum and
gastric specimens and sent them to the CDC Botulism Laboratory. Case
histories were elicited and recorded. Food samples from the identified
common meal were obtained by the health department and were also shipped to
the CDC Botulism Laboratory for analysis.
On 14 Sep 1999, CDC notified all departments involved that both female
patients had tested positive for type A botulism. The man's test was
negative, which the lab indicated was normal for extremely low dose
exposures. The garlic cloves from the home-bottled garlic-infused oil
tested positive for botulism toxin type A. The lab postulated that only 1
or 2 cloves of garlic were actually contaminated. The women chopped those
cloves and added them to their salads. The daughter's husband may have used
the same fork or other utensil and received a minute dose that way. All
other foods tested were negative for type A botulism. A second bottle of
garlic-infused oil was sent to CDC for testing, but did not contain toxin.
A neighbor prepared the garlic-infused oil, intended as Christmas presents
for friends and relatives. Ingredients included cloves of garlic, rosemary,
thyme, and olive oil. Its preparation consisted of: washing the jars in a
home dishwasher; adding sprigs of rosemary and thyme to the hot jars;
filling the jars with whole cloves of pre-peeled, pre-packaged Christopher
Ranch garlic; adding olive oil to within 1/2 inch (1 cm) of the top of the
jars; placing the jar lids and rings in boiling water, which were removed
with a magnetic tool; placing the lids and rings onto the jars; placing the
entire jar into boiling water for 25 minutes; allowing the jars to cool at
room temperature; removing the rings from the jars to dry while the lids
remained intact; washing the jars and lids with detergent and water; and
placing the dried rings on the jars and set the jars on a shelf at room
temperature for later use. Note that there was no acidification step and
the product was not stored refrigerated.
The Sarasota County Health Department Environmental Health Section
retrieved all jars of the product, 47 pints. They were disposed of by
incineration in a biohazardous waste incinerator. Those jars that had
already been given to friends and neighbors had either already been
consumed with no ill effects or disposed of by the individuals before the
health department could obtain them.
Botulism is an intoxication caused by a neurotoxin produced by an
anaerobic, spore-forming, Gram positive, rod-shaped bacterium, _Clostridium
botulinum_. The spores are heat resistant and can survive in foods that are
improperly processed. Most outbreaks are due to types A, B, and E. The
organism and its spores are widely distributed in nature. They are present
in soil, agricultural products, including honey, marine sediment, and the
intestinal tract of animals, including fish. Symptoms of botulism include
weakness, dizziness, blurred or double vision, difficulty in swallowing and
speaking, paralysis, respiratory failure, and death. A very small amount (a
few nanograms) of toxin can cause illness. Onset of symptoms ranges from 12
hours to 8 days (usually 12 to 36 hours) after eating contaminated food. In
general, the shorter the incubation period, the more severe the disease and
the higher the case fatality rate. The duration of illness ranges from one
day to several months.
Foodborne botulism is acquired by ingestion of food in which the toxin has
been formed, predominantly after inadequate heating during preservation and
without subsequent adequate cooking. Foods associated with botulism are
mostly home-canned foods (vegetables and fruits); commercial processed
foods (tuna, smoked fish, mushrooms, soup, garlic in oil, and cheese
sauce); sauteed onions, and leftover baked potatoes. Conditions that favor
the growth include low-acid foods (pH above 4.6), high moisture content
(water activity above 0.93), low salt, food devoid of oxygen, and
unrefrigerated storage.
Infused oils have previously been implicated in botulism outbreaks in the
USA and worldwide (1-4). An acidification step in the preparation of
garlic-infused oil may be necessary to prevent the potential production of
botulism toxins. As noted above, this acidification step was not utilized
in the home bottling process of the suspected infused oil, and the product
was stored at room temperature and not refrigerated. The pH of one of the
jars of garlic-in-oil was 6.4. The treatment temperatures as described were
inadequate to destroy the spores formed by the organism or its toxin.
As a result of previous outbreaks in Vancouver, BC (Canada) and in the
state of New York, the Food and Drug Administration Food Code now requires
2 barriers in the destruction of spores and in the prevention of toxin
production in a commercial product of this type (reduced oxygen packaging):
1) destruction of the spores by heat (thermal processing) 2) inhibition of
toxin production by altering the food through acidification, controlling aw
(water activity), the use of salt and preservatives or refrigeration. Also,
it is because some single barriers can result in a product unacceptable to
consumers that multiple barriers are used. The common second barrier in
infused oil of this kind is acidification via phosphoric or citric acid,
for example. The pH of the final product should be 4.6 or less.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Hammond, who forwarded details of this previously
reported outbreak, which was not covered on ProMED-mail in 1999 and
contains an excellent discussion on the subject. At this point, the thread
is cut. - Mod.LL]
