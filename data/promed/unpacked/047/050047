White-nose syndrome [WNS] has been confirmed in bats in a cave about
80 miles [129 km] northwest of Nashville in Trigg County Kentucky.

The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources and the US
Fish and Wildlife Service have detected the affliction in a little
brown bat.

White-nose syndrome -- first found in New York state in 2006 -- has
killed more than one million cave dwelling bats in eastern North
America.

Mortality rates of bats have reached almost 100 percent in multi-year
infected caves, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.

A total of 16 states, mostly in the eastern US, and 3 Canadian
Provinces have now been confirmed with the disease. Tennessee is one
of those states.

"This is likely the most significant disease threat to wildlife
Kentucky has ever seen," Kentucky wildlife commissioner Jonathan
Gassett said in an emailed announcement.

"It would be professionally irresponsible to take no action to stop
or slow this disease. Bats are an important part of our natural
environment, acting as pollinators and consuming mosquitoes and other
insect pests across the landscape. We plan to aggressively manage this
threat of WNS as it occurs in Kentucky in order to protect and
conserve our bat populations."

Survey showing a hibernating little brown bat in Pennsylvania, with
white-muzzle typical of white nose syndrome.

It would be beneficially to know how the wildlife commissioner plans
to manage this disease. Most states have closed or limited public
access to caves with bats. While it is not confirmed that human
traffic can transport the fungus to the bats, it is one measure that
has been implemented in other states.

We would appreciate the commissioner sharing his ideas with us when
he has formulated a plan. - Mod.TG]
