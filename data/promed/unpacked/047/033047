Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) - multi-country outbreak -
Update 15: 31 Mar 2003
http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_31/en/

The Hong Kong Department of Health has today issued an unprecedented
isolation order to prevent the further spread of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (SADS). The isolation order requires residents of Block E of Amoy
Garden to remain in their flats until midnight on 9 Apr 2003.
The decision to issue the isolation order was made following a continued
steep rise in the number of SARS cases detected in the building over the
past few days. Concern about a possible outbreak in Amoy Garden mounted on
Saturday [29 Mar 2003], when 22 of Hong Kong's 45 new SAR cases
hospitalized that day were determined to be residents of the estate. On
Sunday [30 Mar 2003], 36 of the 60 new patients admitted to hospital with
probable SARS were Amoy Garden residents.
Hong Kong health authorities today informed the public that a cumulative
total of 213 residents of Amoy Garden had been admitted to hospital with
suspected SARS since reporting on the disease began. Hong Kong's outbreak
began on 12 Mar 2003 when health officials first recognized a cluster of
cases of atypical pneumonia in the Prince of Wales Hospital.
Of the 213 Amoy residents affected in the outbreak, 107 patients resided in
Block E. In addition, most of these 107 patients from Block E lived in flats
that were vertically arranged. This suggests that SARS may be spreading in
Hong Kong according to a different pattern, still involving close
person-to-person contact with bodily secretions from an infected person. WHO
epidemiologists are considering the possibility that bodily secretions
containing the causative virus might somehow enter common systems that link
rooms or flats together. This pattern of spread would be in addition to the
well-documented
face-to-face contact that has been seen in the majority of cases reported so
far.
Earlier this month, Hong Kong epidemiologists detected an unusual pattern
of transmission among guests and visitors at the Metropole Hotel during the
critical period of 15 to 23 Feb 2003. Guests and visitors at a single floor
of the hotel are thought to have spread SARS to Toronto and Singapore and
to have started the outbreak in Hong Kong's Prince of Wales Hospital. No
staff at the hotel developed symptoms.
Amoy Garden is a large housing estate consisting of 10 blocks of 35-storey
buildings, where around 15 000 persons reside. It is located in Kowloon
District. WHO has been informed that environmental samples have been taken
from the affected flats in Block E and that investigations are under way to
determine a possible explanation for this apparent vertical spread of the
disease. Although the investigation is complex, results from testing of the
environmental samples should be available within days and will help
determine the source of infection in Block E and the mechanisms by which the
pathogen has spread.
Hong Kong epidemiologists have identified a possible "index" case in the
Amoy Garden outbreak. This is a patient, now hospitalized in Prince of
Wales Hospital, who visited his brother, a resident of Block E, several
times before hospital admission.
Mainland China
---------------
The WHO expert team spent the day in the Beijing Municipality Center for
Disease Control and Prevention reviewing case records for all 10 cases
reported in Beijing Municipality. Following the cases in Guangdong province
in late January [2003] and early February 2003, Beijing Municipality CDC
officials said an enhanced local surveillance system was established by
adding 11 sentinel hospitals (out of 50 total hospitals) to report cases of
atypical pneumonia.
The laboratory service was also geared up to receive specimens and carry
out tests in secure conditions. Other preparation included stockpiling of
drugs, setting up a public hotline, and holding 2 news conferences. In
addition, CDC and hospital staff were trained in prompt reporting of
atypical pneumonia and infection control. An isolation unit was
established. CDC Beijing said that antibiotics and Ribovirin are being used
routinely as treatment and prophylaxis.
The team were told that contact tracing had begun as soon as the first
cases of atypical pneumonia had been recognized in Beijing and had been
carried out for all subsequent cases. 8 of the cases were imported (from
Hong Kong and Taiyuan city, Shanxi province) and 2 were health care workers
who became infected trying to revive a 72-year-old man believed to have
become ill after visiting a relative with SARS in a Hong Kong hospital.
Besides the 2 health care workers, no other cases have been infected in
Beijing.
Discussions concerning a visit by the expert team to Guangdong Province are
continuing with the Ministry of Health.
Update on cases and countries:
--------------------------
As of today, a cumulative total of 1622 cases, with 58 deaths, have been
reported from 13 countries. This represents an increase of 72 cases and 4
deaths since the last figures were compiled on Saturday [29 Mar 2003].
The greatest increase in cases occurred in Hong Kong SAR. The additional
deaths were reported in Canada (1) and Hong Kong (3). Germany reported its
fifth case, and Switzerland its third.

The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As at 1 PM 31 Mar 2003, a total of 79 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia have recovered and been discharged from public hospitals.
Of them, 19 patients, including 9 healthcare workers, were discharged today.
Meanwhile, an additional 80 patients with symptoms of atypical pneumonia
were admitted to public hospitals. They include 2 healthcare workers and 64
patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 14 were new patients and contacts
of patients with atypical pneumonia.
Currently, 64 patients are receiving treatment in the intensive care unit.
A 79-year-old male patient with a history of heart disease died in Prince
of Wales Hospital yesterday afternoon. Another 62-year-old male patient,
who was very ill when admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, passed away. So
far, a total of 15 patients died with atypical pneumonia in public
hospitals.
The cumulative figure for patients admitted to public hospitals with
atypical pneumonia is 610, starting from 12 Mar 2003.
The breakdown of figures is as follows:
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students 164 (164)
45 of the patients were discharged
Patients, family members & visitors 446 (446)
34 of the patients were discharged
Total admission 610 (610)
79 were discharged
Director of Health issues isolation order 31 Mar 2003
-----------------------------------------
Director of Health, Dr Margaret Chan, has ordered Block E of Amoy Garden in
Ngau Tau Kok, Kowloon Bay, to be isolated for a period of 10 days starting
from 6 AM 31 Mar 2003 to prevent the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome (commonly known as atypical pneumonia), a Government spokesman
said.
The decision was taken because of the continued steep rise in the number of
cases of infection in the building in the past few days.
The order, designed to protect the health of residents and the community as
a whole, was issued under the authority granted under Section 24 of the
Prevention of the Spread of Infectious Diseases Regulations, Cap. 141.
The order requires residents of Block E of Amoy Garden to remain in their
flats until midnight on 9 Apr 2003.
During the isolation period, no one will be allowed to enter or leave the
premises without express permission in writing of a health officer.
Medical personnel from the Department of Health will visit residents' homes
to conduct health inspections for them. Residents will be provided 3 meals
a day free of charge. They will also receive help and advice to conduct
thorough cleansing and disinfection of their flats. Staff of the Home
Affairs Department will be briefing residents on the detailed arrangements
to take care of their daily needs.
"We do understand that the measures that we have now taken will cause
residents great inconvenience. But because of the very special
circumstances that we now face, we have no choice but resort to this
exceptional measure and we sincerely ask for residents' forbearance,
understanding and support in joining the community's fight against this
disease." the spokesman said.

SARS: Situation update 31 Mar 2003
More patients recovering and discharged
--------------------------------
One death due to SARS has been reported today. The patient had travelled to
Sarawak with her family from 15 Mar 2003 to 18 Mar 2003 and had developed
fever when she returned to Singapore on 18 Mar 2003.
She presented at NUH Emergency Department on 24 Mar 2003 with features of
pneumonia. At that time, the medical staff were unable to obtain from the
relatives a history of contact with a patient with SARS and she had also
not travelled to an affected areas. She was too unwell to be transferred to
TTSH. Nevertheless, in line with MOH guidelines, she was treated as a
potentially infectious patient and was warded in an isolation room. NUH
staff took all the necessary infection control precautions after her
admission, and the patient was isolated throughout her admission. She was
also not allowed any visitors. She was transferred to the ICU on 24 Mar
2003, where she was received intensive treatment under isolation.
On 30 Mar 2003, one of her relatives gave the history that the NUH patient
had visited a non-SARS patient in a ward in TTSH on 12 Mar 2003. A patient
in this ward was later found to have SARS. As the NUH patient herself was
very sick, it was not possible to ascertain who she had come into contact
with. Despite intensive treatment, her condition worsened and she passed
away today. As a precautionary measure, this patient is being considered as
a case of SARS. Contact tracing is being carried out.
Apart from this case, there were no new cases of SARS reported. As at 31
Mar 2003, a total of 92 people with SARS have been reported to the Ministry
of Health. The total number of people who have recovered from SARS and have
been discharged from hospital is 41. The remaining 47 patients are
hospitalised.
To date, there have been no SARS cases that are linked to the fourth and
fifth imported cases. The cases in Singapore are still traced to the first
3 people who travelled to Hong Kong and contracted SARS. The number of
infected children still remains at 3. There is no change in the number of
persons on the suspect list.
There are 13 patients who are in serious condition, including the fourth
imported case.
Case of death on board the cargo ship, Kota Hasil from Hong Kong
---------------------------------------------------
MOH was notified of a case of an Indonesian crewman who developed high
fever on 23 Mar 2003 while on board a cargo ship sailing between Taiwan and
Hong Kong, and who passed away on 28 Mar 203 while the ship was enroute to
Singapore. The ship arrived in Singapore on 29 Mar 2003 and was anchored in
a quarantine area. 2 doctors from Singapore boarded the vessel and examined
the crew members. Although the history of the illness was not completely
typical of SARS, the doctors took all the necessary infection control
precautions. All crew members were assessed to be well but have not been
allowed to come ashore. The body has been taken to the Centre for Forensic
Medicine. The ship is scheduled to depart Singapore tonight after it has
completed its cargo operations.

[Today's global update from WHO (see [1] above) mentions an additional 72
cases and 4 deaths since the last global update issued on 29 Mar 2003. The
update from the Hong Kong Department of Health mentions an additional 80
cases reported since 30 Mar 2003. The data for case reports from Hong Kong
contained in the WHO update are for cases reported as of 30 Mar 2003 and do
not reflect the additional 80 cases reported in Hong Kong as of 31 Mar 2003.
The report out of Hong Kong re: the association of cases with a vertical
block of apartments in Kowloon is noteworthy, though it is still very early
in the investigation to draw conclusions re: transmission. We will be
following this closely and will report information as it becomes
available. The decision to implement a quarantine of the residents of this
building may seem severe, but given the many unknowns about SARS, and the
observation that there may be a different form of transmission other than
"close contact" here as seen elsewhere, it is hard to be critical of the
Hong Kong Department of Health at this juncture. Elsewhere transmission
still seems to be following a pattern consistent with a need for close
contact with SARS cases.
Roger Feldman MD <Feldmanmail@aol.com> has raised excellent questions about
more detailed epidemiologic information on this outbreak, such as
age-specific case fatality rates, secondary attack rates, more details on
the clinical course, etc. We have tried to present a synopsis of data
available to us at ProMED-mail, and we too look forward to reports
containing more detailed epidemiologic data on this outbreak that we could
share with our readers. It needs to be highlighted that current
investigations use case definitions that are based on clinical and
epidemiological criteria. Clinical criteria include a disease spectrum
that is shared by many other etiologies, especially at this time of year in
the northern hemisphere, and the current epidemiologic criteria include
contact with previously identified cases or presence in geographic areas
with identified local transmission. More definitive details will be
available once an etiologic agent is definitively identified and laboratory
testing becomes available to permit confirmation of true cases of what is
now being referred to as SARS. We've learned a lot about this new emerging
infectious disease in a very short amount of time, but much more will be
learned as more data become available. - Mod.MPP]
