Stomach viruses tearing through communities from California to the
Carolinas wrecked the December holidays for some, and they are
getting the New Year off to an uncomfortable start for others.
The most likely culprits, experts say, are noroviruses, the most
common cause of contagious [sudden-onset] gastroenteritis, better
known as the "stomach flu" [or winter vomiting disease]. Cases occur
every winter, but health officials say that in recent weeks they have
seen 2-3 times as many cases as usual.
The virus, best known as the cause of cruise ship outbreaks, is easy
to catch, hard to wipe out and seems to be everywhere at once. Last
week, San Quentin State Prison closed to new prisoners and visitors
after nearly 500 inmates and guards fell ill with vomiting, diarrhea,
stomach cramps, headaches and low fever. Similar symptoms have been
plaguing staff and residents of nursing homes in several states.
College and pro athletes have missed games. Hundreds of patients have
sought help in emergency rooms since mid-December [2006].
Norovirus infection usually clears up after 2-3 days, but medical
epidemiologist Marc-Alain Widdowson, a norovirus expert at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says the misery of those
days shouldn't be dismissed. "When you're ill, you're really ill," he
says. "People (can) vomit 20 times a day." Norovirus can be spread
through contaminated food or water, causing large outbreaks. About
half of food-borne diseases are thought to be caused by noroviruses,
the CDC says.
But this winter, it is spreading mainly from person to person through
communities, and experts believe the majority of cases are
unreported. Once it's in the house, experts say, it's tough to wipe
out. It can linger for days on surfaces such as children's toys,
keyboards, telephones and doorknobs, and both vomit and stool are
highly infectious. It is present in the stool up to 3 weeks after the
patient recovers, so health officials stress the importance of hand
washing, especially after using the bathroom and before preparing food.
The virus causes illness year-round, though like many, it is more
common in colder months. Why it's so widespread this winter is not
known, Widdowson says. "Some years, it does seem to be a lot worse
than others, and this is one of those."
[It is present] from the Carolinas to California. For example in
Corpus Christi, Texas, there has been "a true minor epidemic here,"
says William Burgin Jr., health authority for the Corpus
Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. "Dozens of cases at a
time were reported" during the holidays, and hundreds more likely
went unreported. Hospitals saw about 3 times as many cases as usual.
"Even our emergency room folks caught it."
In Asheville, North Carolina, 30 to 40 people have been sick enough
to seek emergency room treatment for norovirus symptoms in the past
2-3 weeks, and up to 10 have been hospitalized, says Buncombe County
Health Center medical director Steve Swearingen. And "there's no way
of knowing how many are out in the community."
Twenty nursing homes in Contra Costa County, California, have
reported outbreaks, twice as many as in a normal year, says
communicable-disease program chief Francie Wise. "In one facility, we
had over 50 patients and 21 health care workers sick," she says.
In Wisconsin the state Division of Public Health put out an alert to
local and tribal health departments last month, says spokeswoman
Stephanie Marquis. "It's hitting a lot of people all at the same
time." She says outbreaks in schools led a few, including 2 in
Oshkosh, to close before the holidays.
In Montana cases began in nursing homes the week before Christmas,
says Yellowstone City-County Health Department spokeswoman Barbara
Schneeman. "That's real typical for noroviruses. It seems they like
nursing homes and cruise ships." Six facilities have confirmed
positive cases. No cases were reported last winter, she says, but
there was an outbreak earlier this year. From late March to early
June, "we had about 1100 to 1200 people reporting norovirus infection
to us, but we estimate for every person who reports, there are 2-3
who don't. That would put our numbers in the 4000 to 5000 range."
Outbreaks in nursing homes are of special concern because of the risk
of dehydration caused by vomiting and diarrhea, health experts warn.
Deaths as a result of norovirus are rare. It may be a factor in
roughly 300 deaths, generally in the elderly, the CDC says. But even
the young and healthy are vulnerable. About 50 University of Missouri
football players, coaches, staff and family members were flattened
days before Christmas while in El Paso for a bowl game. "It spread
pretty fast," says Chad Moller, team spokesman. "When you travel in a
plane in closed quarters and are around each other a solid week in a
hotel," it's easy to see why, he says. The disease, often
characterized by doctors as "mild," is anything but that from the
patient's point of view, Burgin says. "The patient is absolutely
miserable. You don't know which end to put on the pot sometimes, you
get cramps, don't feel like doing anything, don't feel like taking
the fluids you need."
Norovirus strikes every year, but the last time it was notably severe
was the winter of 2002-03, when there were several outbreaks on
cruise ships, mainly caused by a new strain known as the Farmington
Hills strain, the CDC's Widdowson says. There are 30 to 40 major
strains; new variations are often responsible for spikes in the
number of cases. Widdowson says the CDC doesn't yet have information
on strains circulating now. Positive [diagnosis] is expensive. Unlike
many bacteria and other viruses, norovirus doesn't grow in a common
lab culture, so it can only be positively identified through
specialized, expensive tests called PCR [RT-PCR; reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction], which are run on stool,
vomit or swab samples from the environment. Because most people
recover at home with no medical care, most cases are never diagnosed.
Infection is no guarantee against future misery, he says. "You may
develop immunity to one group but get whacked by another," he says,
and any immunity gained is only temporary.
However, some people are naturally immune to norovirus infection.
"You can throw as much virus as you want at them, and they won't get
it," he says.
The number of cases was not available, as stomach flu is not a
reportable disease.

[Norovirus infection is rarely confirmed by laboratory diagnosis for
the reasons stated above. First identified as "small round structured
viruses" by electron microscopy, noroviruses comprise a separate
genus in the family _Caliciviridae_, designated _Norovirus_, the name
derived from that of the type species -- _Norwalk virus_. The
noroviruses exhibit considerable diversity and the ICTV
(International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) currently lists 12
tentative virus species within the genus. - Mod.CP]
[We have also learned from a reliable source that there has been at
least one hospital in Juneau Alaska with interrupted services due to
norovirus infection of patients and staff. And the newswires are
filled with other reports of hospitals around the USA and in the UK
with hospitals that have been affected by norovirus
outbreaks. Either the newswire agency are more sensitive to
reporting on norovirus outbreaks this current "winter season" or
there is a real increase in norovirus activity. - Mod.MPP]
