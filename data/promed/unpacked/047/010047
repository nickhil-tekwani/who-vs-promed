Confirmed pertussis in England and Wales: update to end-April 2012
------------------------------------------------------------------
A national increase in laboratory-confirmed cases of pertussis was observed after the 2nd quarter of 2011, predominantly in adolescents and adults. This increase continued into 2012 and extended into infants under 3 months who are at the highest risk of severe complications, hospitalisation, and death. A level 3 incident was declared in April 2012 to coordinate the response to the ongoing increased pertussis activity (1,2).

Pertussis is a cyclical disease with increases occurring every 3-4 years. The increase in 2011 has previously been reported (3), with the last peak occurring in 2008. During 2011, numbers of confirmed cases were high in age groups under 15 years, but in line with anticipated cyclical increases. The number of confirmed cases in the 15+ age group, however, exceeded expected levels; cases in this age group were nearly 50 per cent higher in 2011 than those in 2008. The data below update current pertussis activity to 30 Apr 2012.

The provisional total of confirmed cases of pertussis in 2012 in England and Wales to the end of April 2012 was 1080, compared with 248 in the same period in 2008 (table 1 [for tables, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]). High numbers of cases continue to be confirmed in individuals aged 15 years or older with 777 cases in this period in 2012, compared with 122 cases in 2008. Activity is also high in infants under 3 months with 100 cases in this period in 2012 compared with 49 cases in 2008. 5 pertussis-related deaths in infants were reported to 30 April 2012 and 3 to 30 Apr 2008.

This increase in reporting may, in part, be due to increased awareness among health professionals improving case ascertainment in older age groups. This is reflected by the increased demand for serology testing, which is the predominant method of confirmation in adolescents and adults who typically present with milder features late in the course of the illness. However, waning immunity following vaccination and/or natural infection is also likely to be an important contributory factor (4). The increase in pertussis activity has been observed across all regions in England with continuing reports of clusters in educational settings and incidents linked to health care settings. The highest numbers of confirmed cases in the first 4 months of 2012 have been in the South East and the South West regions (table 2 [see source URL above. - Mod.LL]).

[The increase in cases in the UK further underscores the research by both Dr Frits R Mooi from the Netherlands (Pertussis - Australia (04): newly emerging clones, discussion 20120322.1078115) and Dr Lyn Gilbert from Australia (Pertussis - Australia (03): newly emerging clones 20120321.1076103), which has been highlighted in ProMED-mail. This phenomenon reflects antigenic changes in circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, which may be causing the increased number of pertussis cases throughout the world. If so, these changes may result in a need for modifications to the currently used acellular pertussis vaccines, and without these modifications, selection and further spread of clones not as protected for by the vaccine will continue to increase.

It would be useful to know if older individuals, immunized with the old, killed, whole cell vaccine, have the same level of "break-through" as those immunized with the acellular toxoid vaccine. - Mod.LL
