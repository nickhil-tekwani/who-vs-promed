There is not enough information for a speculative diagnosis in this
post, but might keep bovine babesiosis in the differential list for
it.

If an unsuspecting vet is called to examine a "dead" cow lying
flat-out in a pen or paddock in a tick-infested area, or a farm worker
is required to move an apparently quite sick cow, and it suddenly
jumps up when disturbed and proceeds to very aggressively attack,
quite often it turns out to be a case of cerebral babesiosis -- a
different kind of "mad cow" to the one affected by the prion disease,
quite often occurring in apparently acute 'outbreaks' and just the
sort of thing that might come across via a language translation.

[The original article was rather sparse on details. While it
mentioned hundreds of animals are affected, it did not indicate over
what period of time. The article implied it was recently and not over
a vast period of time. Nevertheless, it may well have occurred over
the course of several weeks. Otherwise, we might have to suspect a
very rapid moving lethal virus, bacterium, or toxin. These may have
been able to affect hundreds of animals in a rapid fashion.

Cerebral babesiosis is possible and should be kept on a differential
list. Babesiosis in several species of animals is on the rise in
Mexico and southern Texas.

If the situation occurred over several weeks, it makes rabies,
especially from vampire bats more plausible, but if a shorter time
frame is involved, then it may not be as likely.

Listeriosis affects many species of animals, including humans.
Initially, affected animals are anorectic, depressed, and disoriented.
They may propel themselves into corners, lean against stationary
objects, or circle toward the affected side. Facial paralysis with a
drooping ear, deviated muzzle, flaccid lip, and lowered eyelid often
develops on the affected side, as well as lack of a menace response
and profuse, almost continuous, salivation; food material often
becomes impacted in the cheek due to paralysis of the masticatory
muscles. Terminally affected animals fall and, unable to rise, lie on
the same side; involuntary running movements are common.

Toxins may include, plants, other feed related toxicants, salt
intoxication/water deprivation, or chemicals such as insecticides.

We are looking forward to an accurate diagnosis and reporting of the
situation.
