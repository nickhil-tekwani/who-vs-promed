The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 8 Nov 2018:
- A total of 319 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 284 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 284 confirmed, 163 died and 97 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 52 suspected cases under investigation.
- 7 new confirmed cases, including 3 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, 1 in Kyondo, and 1 in Vuhovi.
A new confirmed case has been identified in a new Kyondo health zone, located next to Butembo health zone [North Kivu]. The investigations are in progress.
- 7 new confirmed deaths, including 3 in Beni, 2 in Butembo, 1 in Kyondo, and 1 in Mutwanga.
- 6 new recoveries, including 5 in Beni and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response
Message from His Excellency the Minister of Health
--------------------------------------------------
On Fri 9 Nov 2018, the Ebola virus disease epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri just exceeded that of the 1st epidemic recorded in 1976 in Yambuku, in the province of Equateur. To date, 319 cases and 233 deaths have been recorded.

In view of these figures, my thoughts and prayers go to the hundreds of bereaved families, the hundreds of orphans, and the missing families.

At the heart of this unprecedented response are hundreds of men and women who have been working tirelessly for more than 3 months in a difficult and volatile environment to prevent this epidemic from spreading to other provinces in the Democratic Republic of Congo and to neighboring countries.

No other epidemic in the world has been as complex as the one we are currently experiencing. Since their arrival in the region, the response teams have faced threats, physical assaults, repeated destruction of their equipment, and kidnapping. 2 of our colleagues in the Rapid Response Medical Unit even lost their lives in an attack.

Yet, despite the risks and with the support of a majority of the population, our agents continue to do their job with passion and dedication to protect the Nation and the world.

Among their achievements, we particularly remember the vaccination, including in red areas, of more than 27 000 high-risk contacts, at least half of which could have developed the disease. Without the prompt and effective intervention of national and international experts, it is a drama of considerable magnitude that we would be experiencing at the moment. For this courage, they deserve all our gratitude.

However, this epidemic remains dangerous and unpredictable, and we must not let our guard down. We must continue to pursue a very dynamic response that requires permanent readjustments and real ownership at the community level.

We are writing a new page in history and public health. It is with the cooperation and the commitment of all, the Government, the international community, and especially the population, that we will overcome this epidemic.

Thank you.

[This is the 2nd day in a row we are witnessing further spread of Ebola virus, this time to a new health zone, Kyondo, located next to Butembo health zone in North Kivu province, after having been identified in Mutwanga [also in North Kivu] yesterday (8 Nov 2018). Investigations are underway. This slow spread of Ebola virus is concerning, but apparently there still are no overt cases outside the DRC at this time. The Minister of Health declared "...this epidemic remains dangerous and unpredictable...", yet he remains positive about the status of the outbreak. Certainly vaccination of more than 27 000 high-risk contacts is impressive and appears to be very effective. The implementation of the anti-viral agents discussed below and continuing efforts to gain support of the community members also will make an impact. - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
- Thu 8 Nov 2018. As DRC Ebola cases hit 312, officials see some positive signs
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/drc-ebola-cases-hit-312-officials-see-some-positive-signs

Another 4 Ebola cases were reported today [8 Nov 2018] in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak, one from a newly affected health zone, as a high-level group from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) visiting the region said new steps are having an impact on the response.

Abducted responders found safe
------------------------------
Underscoring ongoing deep concerns about security problems in the area, the DRC's health ministry said Mai Mai rebels in a village between Beni and Butembo -- the outbreak's hot spots -- abducted 4 members of the Ebola response. The responders were later found by police to be safe, according to the health ministry's daily update yesterday [7 Nov 2018].

Following a call to emergency services by the family of a person who died in the community, the responders, who included 3 civil protection agents and an epidemiologist, were at the home of a recently deceased patient to decontaminate the house and remove the body to prepare it for burial. After rebels abducted the responders, security coordinators sent an alert to police, who found the group safe and sound.

Top officials get first-hand look at Beni
-----------------------------------------
Security problems related to armed rebel groups and pockets of community resistance have led to several setbacks in the response to the outbreak. ... Health officials are in the DRC this week [week of 8 Nov 2018] to hear from local officials and groups and see what more can be done.

Yesterday [7 Nov 2018] in Beni, the DRC's Health Minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga, MD; North Kivu province's governor; UN Undersecretary General for Peacekeeping Jean-Pierre Lacroix; and WHO Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, were among a group who visited the emergency operations center and met with local security officials at the local town hall.

In a statement from the WHO and UN today [8 Nov 2018], the groups said new measures to overcome response challenges are having a positive impact, with a decline in the rate of new cases over the past 2 weeks, though the outbreak is still dangerous and unpredictable.

Decades of conflict in North Kivu have led to misinformation and mistrust that had contributed to reluctance among some residents to allow Ebola teams to vaccinate, trace contacts, and perform safe burials.

Heightened community surveillance
---------------------------------
The groups said that, under the leadership of the DRC's health ministry, the WHO and its partners have made greater use of community surveillance, in which community members are trained to do contact tracing in areas that are difficult for outsiders to access.

According to the statement, WHO and UN officials also met with DRC Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala to share their observations and recommendations.

As the team wrapped up its visit today, Lacroix on Twitter today praised the work of colleagues in the DRC and partner groups. But he also said that making the outbreak area safer requires a team effort. "The message delivered today is that improving security in North Kivu is everyone's responsibility: MONUSCO and the DRC armed forces. Communities must also be engaged," he said.

Lacroix said partnerships and sustained long-term efforts will defeat the armed groups.

- Thu 8 Nov 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Disease outbreak news, update; abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/08-november-2018-ebola-drc/en/

As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak enters the 4th month since declaration, and case numbers surpass 300, substantial progress has been achieved in all aspects of the response. Nevertheless, there remains a challenging road ahead to control intense transmission in the city of Beni and emerging hotspots in villages around Beni and Butembo. Security incidents and pockets of community resistance continue to impact civilians and frontline workers, requiring the response to continually adapt to the situation. The UN is committed to staying and supporting the Ministry of Health (MoH), and confident that the outbreak can be contained. This week, the WHO Director-General, UN Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping, and WHO Deputy Director-General (DDG) Emergency Preparedness and Response travelled to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to review how further support can be offered to strengthen the response.

[3] Treatment and point of care testing
Date: Fri 9 Nov 2018
Source: Axios [edited]

Ebola treatment trials may begin, as worries grow over Congo outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
US health officials may soon start trials in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to test the efficacy of different Ebola treatments if they get the necessary approvals, Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tells Axios.

Why it matters: The combination of violence against health care workers and the deadly virus caused the head of the Centers for Disease Control to issue a warning earlier this week that Ebola could become "endemic" to Congo. The only potential bright spot to a such a devastating outbreak would be testing experimental treatments to help indicate which ones actually work best, Fauci says.

Driving the news: 4 treatments -- ZMapp, mAb114, remdesivir (GS-5734), and REGN-EB3 (REGN3470-3471-3479) -- are currently under consideration for trials in the DRC, with the hope of beginning as soon as next week if they get approval, Fauci says.

- US public health officials are in the DRC capital of Kinshasa, training medical personnel to prepare for the trials, which have not been finalized yet.

Details of outbreak: Fauci says the worry is that the outbreak could be long-term until the DRC becomes more secure, and public health officials can successfully conduct the ring vaccination, quarantine and treatment procedures needed to contain and eradicate the disease.

Other developments: The Food and Drug Administration announced [Fri 9 Nov 2018] it issued the emergency use authorization (EUA) of a rapid, single-use test for detection of the Zaire Ebola virus, which is the current strain in DRC.

- The test, called DPP Ebola Antigen System, is the 2nd Ebola rapid antigen fingerstick test available under EUA. But it's the 1st that uses a portable battery-operated reader, which could make it ideal for on-the-ground testing during outbreaks.

[EUA approval of the point of care single use rapid antigen fingerstick test is an important advance allowing cases and contacts to be tested on the spot using a portable battery-operated reader. Suspect specimens will not need to be sent to a testing center, saving time, preventing unnecessary exposure to the virus in the treatment centers, and starting treatment of individuals with confirmed infections faster. However, it would be good to see the results of the assay validation with information on sensitivity and specificity of the new assay, especially in comparison to the real time RT-PCR. - Mod.LK
