The incidence of brucellosis in urban population has tripled. According to Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], the brucellosis epidemic is increasing rapidly. During the 1st 7 months of 2015, 73 cases of brucellosis were registered in Stavropol. There were 29 cases reported during the same period in 2014.

The highest prevalence has been recorded in the following districts: Neftekumsky area (9 cases), Levokumsky (8), Shpakovsky (6), Kursky (5), and Alexandrovsky, Budyonnovsky, Izobilnensky, and Novoselitsky areas (4 cases each).

The main source of the disease are infected large and small ruminants. The increased incidence is caused by uncontrolled, illegal trade of meat and dairy products, non-compliance with sanitary-epidemiological norms, poor quality inspection of cattle, sheep, and goats by veterinarians, as well as the sale of meat and dairy products without prior testing and quality assurance.

[It would be useful to obtain further information on the agent involved: _Brucella abortus_ or _B. melitensis_? The latter, which is the historical etiological cause of Malta fever in humans (and is, most probably, the one widely spread in Stavropol), is a specific pathogen of small ruminants (goats and sheep), but may readily infect in-contact cattle. In contrast to _B. abortus_, which is the specific pathogen of bovine brucellosis and a cause of abortion in this species, _B. melitensis_ is less likely to clinically affect cattle (including abortion), but will be disseminated in cattle milk and dairy products, infecting other animals and humans. Meat (muscle tissue) is significantly less likely to be infectious.

Small ruminants (goats and sheep) readily abort following infection with _B. melitensis_ and remain carriers (in fact, vectors) throughout life, though they may give birth to viable offspring in subsequent gestations. The pathogenicity of _B. melitensis_ for humans is generally regarded to be of a higher rate than the pathogenicity of _B. abortus.

On top of the need for sanitary measures and strict compliance with legal requirements, vaccination of the susceptible animal reservoir, provided it is meticulously applied, combined with pasteurization of milk and dairy products, will significantly reduce the human health hazard.

According to a 2013 paper (ref 1), brucellosis is still reported from all types of farms and domestic livestock in Russia. Between 1999 and 2009, the number of infected sites slightly increased, ranging from 54 in 2001 to 112 in 2009. The number of sites affected with _B. melitensis_ reportedly increased but remained low: 13 in 2004 and 21 in 2009 (see Fig 2 "Ovine brucellosis in the Russian Federation, 2003 to 2009" in ref 1).
