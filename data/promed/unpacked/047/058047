Another new variant of the coronavirus appears to have emerged in Nigeria, Africa's top public health official said [Thu 24 Dec 2020], but he added that further investigation was needed. The discovery could add to new alarm in the pandemic after similar variants were announced in Britain and South Africa, leading to the swift return of international travel restrictions and other measures during a major holiday season.

"It's a separate lineage from the UK and South Africa," the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told reporters. He said the Nigeria CDC and the African Center of Excellence for Genomics of Infectious Diseases would analyze more samples. "Give us some time...it's still very early," he said.

The identification of the apparent new variant was based on 2 or 3 genetic sequences, Nkengasong said, but that and South Africa's alert last week were enough to prompt an emergency meeting of the Africa CDC this week. The variant in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, was found in 2 patient samples collected on [3 Aug 2020] and on [9 Oct 2020] in Osun state, according to a working research paper seen by The Associated Press.

Unlike the variant seen in the UK, "we haven't observed such rapid rise of the lineage in Nigeria and do not have evidence to indicate that the P681H variant is contributing to increased transmission of the virus in Nigeria. However, the relative difference in scale of genomic surveillance in Nigeria vs the UK may imply a reduced power to detect such changes," the paper says.

The news comes as infections surge again in parts of the African continent. The African continent now has more than 2.5 million confirmed cases or 3.3% of global cases. Infections across the continent have risen 10.9% over the past 4 weeks, the Africa CDC director said, including a 52% increase in Nigeria and a 40% increase in South Africa.

For the 1st time since confirming sub-Saharan Africa's 1st virus case in February [2020], Nigeria is in the spotlight as infections surge.

"Over recent weeks, we've had a huge increase in the number of samples to (Nigeria CDC) reference lab," the CDC director-general Chikwe Ihekweazu tweeted on [Thu 24 Dec 2020]. "This has led to an unusual delay with testing, but we're working around the clock," with many colleagues cutting short their holidays and returning to work.

Nigeria now has more than 80 000 confirmed coronavirus cases. It saw a record number of daily cases on [17 Dec 2020] with more than 1100, and there has been a "rapid increase" in infections in the past 2 weeks, the Nigeria CDC said this week, citing increased travel and "minimal compliance with COVID-19 safety measures" as reasons.

The government has again imposed some virus restrictions, including limits on gatherings, and recommended closings of bars, nightclubs, and similar venues.

[Undoubtedly the increasing number of reported confirmed cases of coronavirus disease in Nigeria is not surprising due to the complacency and lack of adherence to protective measures. The 2 samples with the variant found were in Osun state but there are no details other than it has 2 or 3 genetic sequences different from the circulating strain of the virus. The report mentions it is different from the UK and South African variants. With the resumption of restrictions in work, closure of schools, gathering in religious places, and the stepping down of the COVID-19 response to states amidst the increasing numbers of confirmed cases in the country is a resolve to decrease transmission of the disease. - Mod.AA

ref: Lumley SF, O'Donnell DO, Stoesser NE, et al. Antibody status and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers. NEJM, December 23, 2020. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa2034545
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
The relationship between the presence of antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the risk of subsequent reinfection remains unclear.

Methods
We investigated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in seropositive and seronegative health care workers attending testing of asymptomatic and symptomatic staff at Oxford University Hospitals in the United Kingdom. Baseline antibody status was determined by anti-spike (primary analysis) and anti-nucleocapsid IgG assays, and staff members were followed for up to 31 weeks. We estimated the relative incidence of PCR-positive test results and new symptomatic infection according to antibody status, adjusting for age, participant-reported gender, and changes in incidence over time.

Results
A total of 12 541 health care workers participated and had anti-spike IgG measured; 11 364 were followed up after negative antibody results and 1265 after positive results, including 88 in whom seroconversion occurred during follow-up. A total of 223 anti-spike-seronegative health care workers had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10 000 days at risk), 100 during screening while they were asymptomatic, and 123 while symptomatic, whereas 2 anti-spike-seropositive health care workers had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10 000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.44; P=0.002). There were no symptomatic infections in workers with anti-spike antibodies. Rate ratios were similar when the anti-nucleocapsid IgG assay was used alone or in combination with the anti-spike IgG assay to determine baseline status.

Conclusions
The presence of anti-spike or anti-nucleocapsid IgG antibodies was associated with a substantially reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in the ensuing 6 months.

----
SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing of combined nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens for symptomatic staff (those with new persistent cough, temperature of 37.8 deg C or higher [100.04 deg F], or anosmia or ageusia) was offered beginning on [27 Mar 2020]. Asymptomatic health care workers were invited to participate in voluntary nasal and oropharyngeal swab PCR testing every 2 weeks and serologic testing every 2 months (with some participating more frequently for related studies) beginning on [23 Apr 2020], as previously described. Staff were followed until [30 Nov 2020].

... A total of 12 541 health care workers underwent measurement of baseline anti-spike antibodies; 11 364 (90.6%) were seronegative and 1177 (9.4%) seropositive at their first anti-spike IgG assay, and seroconversion occurred in 88 workers during the study... Of 1265 seropositive health care workers, 864 (68%) recalled having had symptoms consistent with those of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), including symptoms that preceded the widespread availability of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; 466 (37%) had had a previous PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, of which 262 were symptomatic. Fewer seronegative health care workers (2860 [25% of the 11 364 who were seronegative]) reported prebaseline symptoms, and 24 (all symptomatic, 0.2%) were previously PCR-positive.

... Positive baseline anti-spike antibody assays were associated with lower rates of PCR-positive tests. Of 11 364 health care workers with a negative anti-spike IgG assay, 223 had a positive PCR test (1.09 per 10 000 days at risk), 100 during asymptomatic screening and 123 while symptomatic. Of 1265 health care workers with a positive anti-spike IgG assay, 2 had a positive PCR test (0.13 per 10 000 days at risk), and both workers were asymptomatic when tested. The incidence rate ratio for positive PCR tests in seropositive workers was 0.12 (95% CI, 0.03 to 0.47; P=0.002). The incidence of PCR-confirmed symptomatic infection in seronegative health care workers was 0.60 per 10 000 days at risk, whereas there were no confirmed symptomatic infections in seropositive health care workers. No PCR-positive results occurred in 24 seronegative, previously PCR-positive health care workers; seroconversion occurred in 5 of these workers during follow-up.

... In this longitudinal cohort study, the presence of anti-spike antibodies was associated with a substantially reduced risk of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection over 31 weeks of follow-up. No symptomatic infections and only 2 PCR-positive results in asymptomatic health care workers were seen in those with anti-spike antibodies, which suggests that previous infection resulting in antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is associated with protection from reinfection for most people for at least 6 months.

... Owing to the low number of reinfections in seropositive health care workers, we cannot say whether past seroconversion or current antibody levels determine protection from infection or define which characteristics are associated with reinfection. Similarly, we cannot say whether protection is conferred through the antibodies we measured or through T-cell immunity, which we did not assess.

[The authors are focused on addressing the question of duration of immunity defined as the presence of antibodies (anti-spike IgG and anti-nucleocapsid) and the occurrence of documented (PCR) infection during the course of the study. There has been a lot of concern (justifiably) about duration of immunity, especially in the face of repeated reports of possible re-infection but more importantly duration of immunity following vaccination. This study did not address the role of T cell immunity, something that may be relevant in protection once the measurable antibodies have waned significantly. That being said, the study seems to support at least 6 months of immunity in those with measurable antibodies, increased from 3 months identified in earlier studies. - Mod.MPP]

- The Americas region reported 45.7% of daily case numbers and 44.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 33.5 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, and Canada. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Chile, and Peru. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Uruguay.

- The European region reported 41.4% of daily case numbers and 43.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 24.6 million. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include UK, Germany, Russia, Turkey, France, Czech Republic, Italy, Poland, Ukraine, and Netherlands. There are 20 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 9 countries reporting more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 3.7% of daily case numbers and 4.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.75 million cases. Iran is dominant with decreasing daily case counts now around 6300, followed by Morocco, Lebanon, Pakistan, Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Tunisia, UAE, and Iraq. Egypt and Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000.

- The African region reported 2.7% of daily case numbers and 3.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.77 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting over 14 000 new cases, followed by Nigeria, Uganda, Algeria, Niger, Namibia, Mozambique, Burkina Faso, Eswatini/Swaziland, DR Congo, and Angola. Ethiopia, Kenya, and Cameroon, among other countries, did not report any new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.0% of daily case numbers and 0.82% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 1.03 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 5.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 4.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.7 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant although with decreasing numbers of cases, followed by Indonesia (at above 7500), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing 87% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases and deaths on a daily basis.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (194 174), Brazil (58 916), and UK (39 036), have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 822 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (23-24 Dec 2020). Noteworthy is that Ukraine has reported more than 1 million cumulative cases, making it the 17th country to have reported more than 1 million cases. 8 countries have reported more than 2 million cases cumulatively.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (17 countries) include the USA, Brazil, UK, Russia (29 935), Germany (26 418), India (23 924), Spain (21 736), France (21 634), Turkey (18 102), Italy (18 039), Colombia (14 940), South Africa (14 305), Czech Republic (14 149), Poland (13 115), Mexico (12 485), Netherlands (11 499), and Ukraine (11 490). A total of 59 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 29 of the 59 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the South East Asia region, and 2 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 1.6%. The 7-day average daily reported new cases is 636 472, and deaths is 11 596. The USA is showing reduced reporting with Michigan, North Carolina, Kentucky, the Military, Rhode Island, Wyoming, and Federal prisons among other usual reporting units, not reporting any cases or deaths in the past 24 hours. Similar comparative averages for the USA show a decrease of 6.5% in reported cases and an increase of 4.9%% in reported deaths. - Mod.MPP]
