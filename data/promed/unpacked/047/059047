Western Cape healthcare workers were baffled when a 7-year-old girl had symptoms of fever, seizures and diarrhoea for nearly 2 months. In its monthly communiqué, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) said the girl first went for a check-up in December [2021] after having 2 seizures at home.

The NICD said: "On examination, she was febrile (38.4°C [101.1°F]) and had mild dehydration, with the rest of the examination being normal. She was admitted to Red Cross Hospital for a CT brain scan, which was normal. Blood work was congruent with the clinical picture of mild dehydration. She was discharged on 28 Dec 2021."

But, about 2 weeks later, she went to the hospital again for diarrhoea and vomiting. Her temperature was 39.8°C [103.6°F], and she was discharged after being given oral rehydration therapy.

Three days later, she was back at the hospital with ongoing vomiting and fever. They performed an electroencephalogram (EEG) on her to check if she might have epilepsy. Her blood work, the NICD said, showed anaemia, thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet count), and the presence of malaria parasites, with a subsequent diagnosis of cerebral malaria.

"She commenced IV artesunate and recovered fully. As she had no recent history of travel to a malaria-endemic area, her illness was termed odyssean malaria."

The NICD said a full environmental investigation was done to try and figure out how she got the disease. It said: "No vector source was found at the patient's usual places of residence, and the only potential link to a source was a neighbour who was confirmed to have travelled from Mozambique in the last week of December [2021]. Thankfully, no additional malaria cases were diagnosed in the area."

According to the NICD, odyssean malaria is also known as airport, suitcase, minibus, or taxi-rank malaria. It is likely that a malaria vector mosquito, accidentally transported from a malaria area, was responsible.

This is not the 1st time someone with no history of travel has been infected with malaria. In 2017, 4 cases of malaria were reported in Kilner Park, Pretoria, affecting people with no recent history of travel. At the time, the NICD said that between 2007 and 2017, over 69 cases of odyssean malaria had been reported in the country, mostly in Gauteng.

The NICD said as a precautionary measure, healthcare facilities in the district were advised to be suspicious of malaria in individuals presenting with "flu-like illnesses."

"This presentation of delayed diagnosis of malaria, as well as complicated malaria, is typical in odyssean malaria cases. Healthcare workers should check for malaria in patients with recurrent unexplained pyrexia even with no history of travel, to prevent delayed diagnosis and subsequent complications."

[Such cases are rare but not unknown. If the climate is suitable and the local _Anopheles_ mosquitoes are able to transmit malaria, it may be an infection from a person with a recent travel history to a malaria-endemic country; as in this case, Mozambique.

Other cases are more obscure like the case ProMED recently reported from Spain (see below) and a case from Italy where genetic analysis found the same strain of _P. falciparum_ in an Italian girl and a patient from Burkina Faso admitted to the same hospital. The route of transmission was never established. An analysis from the ECDC in 2018 listed 6 cases, mostly transfusion related. - Mod.EP
