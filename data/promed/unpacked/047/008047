The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries have declared a Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak today [12 Mar 2018] in Yirol East, Yirol West, and Awerial Counties of Eastern Lakes state.

The declaration was preceded by a joint high-level advocacy mission led by the Minister of Health, Dr Riak Gai Kok. The mission, comprised of representatives from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), visited Yirol East on 6 Mar 2018 to consolidate response efforts and solicit more commitments by all stakeholders to contain the outbreak.

The RVF outbreak was 1st suspected in December 2017 [Information on the human cases and their tests were included in earlier posts. - Mod.AS].

Following the reported cases and deaths, the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, with support from WHO, FAO and other human and animal experts, launched a multi-sectoral response in the context of One Health for in-depth investigations to establish the exact cause of the reported deaths and illnesses in humans and animals.

One of the initial 7 animal samples tested at UVRI (Uganda Virus Research Institute) was positive for RVF. Furthermore, 8 out of 21 samples collected from animals tested positive for RVF at the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reference laboratory in South Africa [Detailed test results of samples from animals, and a respective map, are available at https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/OEW10-39032018.pdf. - Mod.AS].

A joint multi-sectoral contingency plan has been developed, which will be fully rolled out in Eastern Lakes to ensure RVF is contained. This will involve intensified surveillance in both humans and animals, risk communication, and case management.

RVF is a viral zoonotic disease that primarily affects animals, but also has the capacity to infect humans. People are infected with RVF virus through contact with blood, body fluids, or tissues of RVF virus-infected animals, mainly livestock. This direct contact with infected animals can occur during slaughter or veterinary procedures, like assisting an animal giving birth. Less commonly, people can be infected with RVF virus from bites of infected mosquitoes and, rarely, from other biting insects that have the virus on their mouthparts. Spread from person to person has not been documented.

[As indicated above, the main source of human RVF are animals, primarily sheep, goats, cattle, and camels. Early detection of the disease in animals is pre-conditional for the protection of human health. Unfortunately, as in many previous events, humans, instead of animals, have played the role of sentinels during the earlier stages of the current event.

Disease surveillance is the main pillar of early detection and response, which may include preventive vaccination of the susceptible animal population, the potential source of human disease. FAO, which works consistently with countries to improve RVF surveillance capacity, has recently published the manual "Rift Valley Fever Surveillance," tailored to the African conditions (80 pages; available at http://www.fao.org/3/i8475en/I8475EN.pdf).

RVF is reportedly circulating at present also in Senegal (see commentary in archive no. 20180310.5678018). - Mod.AS
