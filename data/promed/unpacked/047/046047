Update to MEDICAL HERPETOLOGY:(*) April, 1998.
According to a new study in the magazine California Agriculture and a recent
article in the Journal of Parasitology there is something in Western Fence
Lizard blood which, while regularly bitten by Lyme disease carrying ticks,
kills the Lyme disease spirochete.
As infected ticks suck blood from the western Fence Lizards something in the
lizard's blood kills the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The bacteria is
destroyed. The ticks and the lizards are unharmed.
"Lizards are doing humanity a greater service in the west," Robert Lane, an
insect biologist at UC Berkeley is quoted in today's NY Times. He is the
author of the recent articles.
The lizard blood contains a substance, probably a heat sensitive protein
(peptide antibiotic) that kills the Lyme Disease spirochete (_Borrelia
burgdorferi_). The bacteria is found both in western and eastern ticks but the
incidence of Lyme disease among people in the western U.S. is much lower
than it is in the eastern regions. By drinking the lizards blood the ticks
are sanitized of the bacteria. Dr. Lane and coworkers noticed that western
black-legged ticks feed primarily on fence lizards whereas in the
northeastern U.S. their primarily host are white-footed mice. Further study
showed that in spite of being the tick's favorite meal, these particular
lizards are free of the bacteria. A typical lizard in the spring may have 30
to 40 juvenile ticks sucking its blood but it remains bacteria-free.
In in-vitro experiments, researchers drew lizard blood and added the Lyme
disease spirochete to it. The bacteria died in less than an hour.
Spirochetes placed in mouse blood lived for days. Lane believes that the
bacteria killing substance in the lizards blood travels to the young tick's
mid gut and kills all the spirochetes. Interestingly about 50% of the
eastern ticks carry the germ whereas about 5% of the western ticks have it.
Clearly the proclivity of feeding on lizards kills the germ in the juvenile
ticks.
The lizard-blood substance has been isolated but it is not been
biochemically identified. And it is too soon to tell if it can be used in
the treatment of the disease in humans and other mammals.
The presence of Lyme disease carrying ticks on lizards and snakes was
pointed out in Medical Herpetology in 1994 along with the observation that
the spirochete has not been found in the blood of some reptiles. This new
study confirms these earlier observations.
