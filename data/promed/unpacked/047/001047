There has been a recent increase in the number of cases of food poisoning
due to a strain of the _Salmonella_ bacterium, according to the Public
Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). The PHLS has so far identified 170 cases
of [disease caused by _Salmonella typhimurium_ DT104 during August. This
is roughly double the number in the same period last year. Cases have
occurred throughout England, Wales and Northern Ireland. One patient died
after developing septicaemia (blood poisoning), a rare but severe
complication of salmonellosis.
Dr Sarah O'Brien, of the PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre
said, "typically, cases of [salmonellosis increase over the summer months.
However, the fact that these 170 strains show resistance to exactly the
same range of drugs does suggest that there may well be links between them.
Ongoing surveillance will help us to establish whether this is a
continuing problem, while our interviewing of the cases will help to shed
light on whether there any common factors."
The PHLS is working with local public health colleagues and the Food
Standards Agency, to investigate the increase in cases and to try to
establish if there is a common source.
