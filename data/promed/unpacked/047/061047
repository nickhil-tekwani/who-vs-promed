Three more people from Melbourne's northern suburbs have contracted
legionnaire's disease, but authorities believe the outbreak may be over.
The number of confirmed cases is now 16 and a further 10 are suspected. Two
cooling towers in the Thomastown area have tested positive to Legionella
and the owners have received decontamination notices. Victoria's chief
health officer Graham Rouch says no more cases of the disease have occurred
since Sunday, which is a positive sign.
"We're looking good for seeing the end of the actual outbreak, but it
doesn't mean there might not be still some cases yet to be found that prove
to be linked to the outbreak," he said.
