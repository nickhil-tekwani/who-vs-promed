A possible new threat to Cape vineyards? Survey of vines affected by
aster yellows under way
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is concern in the wine industry that the occurrence of the
dreaded aster yellows disease in grapevines is being under-stated and
that unless the scale of the problem is urgently gauged and remedial
measures instituted, it may have wider production consequences.

Plant South Africa, which certifies planting material, has issued a
media release about the situation, saying the national department of
agriculture, in collaboration with researchers of Stellenbosch
University and VinPro are continuing with further investigations
after the disease was first spotted in the vineyards 2 years ago. It
seems as if there are financial problems getting funding for the
research. Nico van Rensburg, manager of Plant SA, says: "A survey to
determine the magnitude of the problem in vineyards in the Western
Cape, as well as a study to find the biological vector of the
disease, in collaboration with Winetech, will start in the near future."

Aster yellows is a phytoplasma disease and can harm various
agricultural crops. This phytoplasma occurs on host plants including
weeds, cover, and vegetable crops, as well as flowers. Phytoplasma
diseases of grapevine are found in Europe, and, especially in France,
Italy, and Spain, where losses are suffered if they are not
controlled. Often vines have to be removed.

Nico Van Rensburg says aster yellows is transmitted mainly by
leafhoppers, but can also be transmitted by the distribution of
infected plant material. "Control of the disease therefore relies on
prevention by only planting nursery material from a reliable source,
hot water treatment, as well as the chemical control of the insect
vector and weeds that potentially serve as an alternative host."

[Aster yellows phytoplasma (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma asteris, 16SrI-B
taxonomic group) can infect over 300 host species including a wide
variety of crops such as canola, lucerne, grapevine, flax, sunflower,
echinacea, caraway, coriander, lettuce, carrots, beets, onions, pea,
ornamental plants, weeds and, to a lesser extent, cereals. Symptoms
in grapevine include yellowing, plant weakness, incomplete
lignification, flexible shoots, and drooping. Affected leaves are
thicker than normal, brittle, rolled downward and show veinal
yellowing and necrosis. Grape bunches become dry and shrivelled
before fruit can fully develop and ripen.

The phytoplasma can overwinter in the living crowns of perennial
crops and weeds. It can be transmitted by grafting, but not in soil,
or by seed. The primary vector appears to be the aster leafhopper
(_Macrosteles quadrilineatus_). After acquiring the pathogen, insects
remain infective for life. The pathogen may be present in host
species at very low levels; however, the level can increase under
favourable conditions (for example high rainfall) resulting in an
outbreak with potential crop losses. Disease management in field
crops may include vector control and removal of weed reservoir
species, but most importantly the use of clean planting and grafting material.

The report above also refers to several other phytoplasmas, which are
known to affect grapevine in different regions. These include the
agents of 'flavescence doree' and 'bois noir' in Europe, as well as
other 'grapevine yellows' diseases worldwide. Different strains or
species of aster yellows phytoplasmas have been isolated from
different hosts, and it remains to be clarified whether several
different phytoplasmas of this group can infect grapevine and what
their epidemiology and interactions may be.
