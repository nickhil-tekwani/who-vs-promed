Two of the 17 cases of rubella detected in the past few days in Alcaniz occurred in a local nursery, and this led health care authorities to implement some measures, including bringing forward immunization dates with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) triple vaccine for children older than one year, until their 2 doses are completed.

This occurrence was reported in the most recent epidemiological bulletins issued by the Health and Sanitation Department of Aragon Government, corresponding to the epidemiological week between 26 Mar and 1 Apr 2012, also indicating that within the context of this alert, there are still 3 cases awaiting biological confirmation. 4 additional cases have been detected in Zaragoza.

Since the last days of February, the Epidemiological Surveillance System in Aragon received information regarding 6 confirmed cases and 2 under investigation; including the cases from Alcaniz, and a single confirmed case and another under investigation in Zaragoza.

According to the Aragon Government, all cases occurred in Romani heritage teenagers and young adults, but in none of them was there a history of recently traveling to their motherland [Romania?]. The Public Health authorities have applied control measures such as case isolation, contact identification, and assessment of their immune status, followed by vaccination if indicated, and separating pregnant women from potential contacts. Also, a campaign enforcing the administration of the triple MMR vaccine in the general population was implemented, particularly for persons with Romani heritage.

Also, during this period there were greater than expected numbers of influenza cases, although not reaching alert levels: 626 in Huesca, 558 in Teruel, and 3364 in Zaragoa. The Health Department decided to declare the end of the epidemic wave, since the incidence was below the epidemic threshold for 2 weeks in succession (10.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants), but influenza surveillance will continue for a few more weeks in the Aragon Sentinel Network.

[Aragon is the 4th (of 17) major region of Spain and makes up a 10th of the whole area of Spain. It has a population of some one and quarter million, but at a very low density (24 compared to the national average of 76 a square kilometre). The interactive HealthMap of Aragon can be accessed at: http://healthmap.org/r/2bkL.

Rubella (also known as German measles) is a viral infection that used to be common in children. Rubella is usually a mild infection. Symptoms of rubella include a distinctive red-pink skin rash, swollen glands, cold-like symptoms such as a sore head and runny nose. The only time that rubella becomes a serious concern is if a pregnant woman catches the infection during the 1st 16 weeks of her pregnancy. This is because the rubella virus can disrupt the development of the baby and cause a wide range of health problems, such as: eye cataracts, deafness, heart abnormalities and brain damage. The birth defects caused by rubella virus are known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Since the introduction of the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccine CRS is now rare in most developed communities.

The outbreak in Aragon appears to be affecting mainly members of the Romani community, an ethnic group living mostly in Europe, who trace their origins to the Indian Subcontinent. Romani are widely known in the English-speaking world by the exonym Gypsies. They are known collectively in the Romani language as Romane or Rromane (depending on the dialect concerned) and also as Romany, Romanies, Romanis, Roma or Roms. Romani are widely dispersed, with their largest concentrated populations in Europe, especially the Roma of Central and Eastern Europe and Anatolia, followed by the Kale of Iberia and Southern France. - Mod.CP]
