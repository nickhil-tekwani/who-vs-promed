New Zealand: epidemic of influenza B virus infection
----------------------------------------------------
New Zealand is currently experiencing an epidemic of influenza B virus
infection. Both influenza B Shanghai-like virus and influenza B Hong
Kong-like virus have been isolated. However, influenza B Hong Kong-like
virus is currently the predominant strain. Children and young people are
predominantly affected with absenteeism rates in schools in some areas of
greater than 20 per cent.
Currently, 3 deaths have been identified in association with this epidemic:
1. A child who developed Reye syndrome. This child was on aspirin for
another condition.
2. An otherwise fit and well adolescent who developed _ Staphylococcus
aureus_ pneumonia and septicemia.
3. An otherwise fit and well child who developed _ Staphylococcus aureus_
pneumonia and septicemia.
2 of these deaths are under investigation by New Zealand coroners. The
viral isolates in all 3 cases have been identified as an influenza B Hong
Kong-like strain. (The current Southern Hemisphere vaccine contains an
influenza B Shanghai-like strain).
Viral isolates are going to the WHO collaborating center in Melbourne, and
CDC have also been advised. The New Zealand Ministry of Health has been
advised that Australia is not currently experiencing a similar situation of
outbreak or epidemic, but is unaware of the situation in the Pacific.

New Zealand: MoH warns influenza B can be serious health risk to children
and young people
-----------------------------------------------
A currently circulating strain of influenza [virus] has not been common in
New Zealand since 1987, and children and young people can be at particular
risk of serious illness, the Ministry of Health stated. "Influenza B is
reaching epidemic rates in children and young people in the North Island,
with high rates of absenteeism in some schools. We now know that, in the
last 6 weeks, 3 young people became ill with influenza B and have died from
complications from the virus," Ministry spokesman Dr Pat Tuohy said. "We
are currently asking all hospitals to tell us whether they are treating
children and young people with the same sorts of illnesses."
The Ministry last week advised parents and clinicians to be vigilant and
warned that the current rate of influenza in New Zealand communities was
higher than at the same time last year [2004], with tests confirming
influenza B viruses were dominant. Dr Tuohy, chief advisor child and youth
health, said today [Tue 21 Jun 2005] that information since then had
confirmed that the 3 deaths in young people involved complications from
influenza B. "In New Zealand, we have not seen large numbers of people
infected with this type of influenza (Hong Kong B) since 1987, although a
few people had it in 2002. What that means is that most people born since
1987 will not have natural immunity and are hence more likely to be
susceptible," he said. "There are 2 strains of influenza B circulating at
present, Hong Kong and Shanghai. The 3 young people who died had the Hong
Kong strain."
"We have to remember that as many as 600 children and young people die each
year in New Zealand, and up to 10 per cent of these are from infectious
diseases. However, we are sufficiently concerned by these 3
influenza-related deaths to repeat our messages of last week [3rd week June
2005] and ask parents and health professionals to be extra vigilant."
"All parents, caregivers and clinicians need to be aware that the impact of
influenza B on children and adolescents can be much more severe than has
previously been recognized, and to care for any young person with
influenza-like symptoms with this in mind." Dr Tuohy said it was only now
being recognized internationally that influenza B could lead to serious
illness and death from a secondary infection in children. "It now seems
likely that, around the world, influenza B has been implicated in more
deaths in children and young people than the records show. Although the
cause of death may have been recorded as bacterial pneumonia or some other
infection, in fact it was the influenza B which made them vulnerable to
that infection."
Dr Tuohy said the Ministry of Health was advising all health professionals
of the particular risks influenza B poses to children and young people. It
was recommending to family doctors that, if they suspected a child or young
person could have influenza B, they should assess them and refer them to
specialist care if they had any concerns about possible complications.
Hospital doctors are also being informed.
"For parents, it's really important that we keep a close eye on children
sick with flu-like symptoms. If children are unwell, they should be kept at
home from school with a parent or responsible guardian."
Dr Tuohy said the annual influenza immunization is the best form of defense
against influenza, and he strongly urged people to get immunized,
particularly those who are most vulnerable and in the at-risk groups .
These people are at higher risk of developing complications from an
influenza infection. Of the 2 influenza B strains in circulation, B
Shanghai is included in this year's [2005] vaccine. B Hong Kong is not in
this year's vaccine but was included in last year's vaccine. Influenza
vaccine is recommended and subsidized for children with certain chronic
health conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease or who
are being treated for cancer.

[The influenza B viruses are classified in the genus _Influenzavirus B_ of
the family _Orthomyxoviridae_, and B viruses have circulated in humans
continuously since 1st isolated in 1940, causing recurrent epidemics of
respiratory disease.
Unlike the influenza A viruses, there are no distinct antigenic subtypes of
influenza B viruses, and, in the absence of non-human hosts, abrupt
antigenic shifts do not occur. Antigenic change occurs by antigenic drift,
more slowly than in the case of the influenza A viruses, but epidemics
characterized by high attack rates in children occur every few years. - Mod.CP]
