[Due to concern about the risk of chikungunya virus entering the supply of blood and blood products, the Puerto Rico Department of Health issued an administrative order requiring that all blood donations be quarantined for 72 hours pending follow-up on donor history for acute infectious symptoms. As an alternative safety measure the American Red Cross halted local platelet collections and began supplying Puerto Rico with blood components imported from the continental USA (http://www.pharmiweb.com/pressreleases/pressrel.asp?ROW_ID=109878#.VQiYR46Rd8F#ixzz3UgCc1oEu).

Pacific
---
French Polynesia (national). 20 Mar 2015. The French Polynesian government says the chikungunya outbreak that affected about 2/3 of the population is now over. The outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease, which began in October [2014], has claimed 16 lives and prompted about 70 000 people to seek medical care. The outbreak spread to all archipelagos and while some people are still getting infected, their numbers are fewer than 5 per 10 000.
http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/pacific/269097/french-polynesia-chikungunya-outbreak-over

[It is good to learn that the chikungunya outbreak in French Polynesia is coming to an end. A recent report in Emerging Infectious Diseases 21(4) of April 2015 by Aubry and colleagues indicated that phylogenetic analysis showed that French Polynesia's chikungunya virus strain belongs to the Asian lineage and is more closely related to a strain collected in the British Virgin Islands in 2014 (VG14/99659) and to the French Polynesian strain imported from Guadeloupe in May 2014 (PF14-270514-51impGP), with 99.9 per cent homology, than to the strains that recently circulated in Yap State (FM13/3807), Tonga (TO14-080414-3007 and TO14-080414-3042), and New Caledonia (NC11-568) (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/4/14-1741_article). This is another illustration of long-distance movement of this virus by viremic individuals who introduce the virus into localities where vector mosquitoes are sufficiently abundant to permit ongoing transmission.

[2] Persistent symptoms

Marimoutou C, Ferraro J, Javelle E, Deparis X, Simon F: Chikungunya infection: self-reported rheumatic morbidity and impaired quality of life persist six years later. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2015. pii: S1198-743X(15)00316-X. doi: 10.1016/j.cmi.2015.02.024. [Epub ahead of print]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
This study presents the 6 year follow-up of French gendarmes exposed to the chikungunya (CHIK) [virus] infection in 2006 on Reunion Island. The aim was to see to what extent the subjective health differences observed in 2008 (30 months after infection) between CHIK [virus] infected (CHIK+) and non-infected (CHIK-) gendarmes still persisted in 2012, and to investigate a possible return to a pre-CHIK health status for CHIK+ subjects. Gendarmes were contacted by mail in 2012 and asked to fill-in a self-questionnaire asking for morbidity, healthcare, and medicines consumption since the last follow-up in 2008. Quality of life (QoL) after 6 years was evaluated using the SF-36 scale.

In comparison with CHIK- subjects (n=171), CHIK+ (n=81) presented with higher rheumatic but also non-specific morbidity such as headaches and fatigue associated with a large psychological impact, frequent depressive moods and social disabilities, leading to a significant impairment of the quality of life and higher healthcare consumption. When restricted to CHIK+ subjects, comparing the data with that of 2008, showed persistent but decreasing self-reported rheumatic morbidity, and an increase over time of chronic discomfort (headache, fatigue) and depressive moods, resulting in no overall improvement in QoL. Despite possible cohort attrition bias, the comparability of CHIK+/CHIK- subjects allows the assumption of a long-term impact of CHIK [virus] infection with less chance of returning to a previous health status. Although these results may be specific to the 2006 virus strain, we recommend that public health strategies in the epidemic-prone countries include a response to the consequences of chronic post-CHIK disorders.
