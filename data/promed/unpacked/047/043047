[The morbidity with generalized forms of meningococcal infection during the last 20 years varied within wide limits: from 0.2 to 5.0 per 100 thousand population in the different regions. Epidemics occur in cycles with peaks in incidence every 10-12 to 30 years. Currently in Russia, several polysaccharide vaccines against meningococcus A and C and meningococcal conjugate vaccine (serogroups A, C, Y and W-135) are registered. Vaccines against the meningococcus serogroup B are not available in Russia. Meningococcal vaccine coverage in Russia is, on average, 30-40 percent. - Mod.NP
