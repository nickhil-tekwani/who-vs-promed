Mulago hospital in Uganda confirms their 1st [fatal?] case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The ministry of health has confirmed that the CCHF has claimed the life of one female, aged 27. The deceased was admitted at Mulago Hospital. Dr Jane Ruth Aceng, the Director-General of health services, said the patient was admitted on 16 Aug 2013 with severe anaemia, vomiting, headaches, and inter-menstrual bleeding.

Aceng said the Ministry would intensify its response to the disease. The statement said this is the 1st confirmed death since the outbreak of the disease was announced on 16 Aug 2013 [see ProMED-mail post Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda (02): (AG) conf. case 20130819.1888823].

After confirmation of the disease in Kampala, Mulago Hospital has reopened its isolation facility to admit suspected cases in and around Kampala. "Currently, there are no admissions at the isolation facility. A burial team has been instituted to co-ordinate the burials of suspected and confirmed cases," Aceng said. She said there is only one confirmed case admitted in Agago at Kalongo Hospital. The Ministry of Health has delivered drugs and other health supplies to the hospital.

The ministry has also intensified its surveillance activities in Kampala and Agago districts to trace cases of the disease. The 36 people who [had] contact with the confirmed cases have been listed and are being monitored for signs and symptoms of the disease. Samples have been collected from humans and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute to aid the investigations into the disease.

Working with the Ministry of Agriculture, 50 samples have been collected from sheep, goats, cows, and dogs in Agago district to trace the source of the disease.
