Guidance for Suspected Anthrax Cases
------------------------------------
_Bacillus anthracis_, commonly known as anthrax, has been diagnosed on a Southern Indiana beef cattle farm. A private practitioner collected tissue samples for laboratory testing after the animal died unexpectedly. Only a single, mixed-breed bull died; other animals in the herd have not shown clinical signs. The infected animal was incinerated on-site, and the farm was placed under a 30-day quarantine and observation order by the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH). BOAH has advised vaccination for all remaining animals on the site.

The situation does not pose a public health threat. Only people who had direct contact with the infected animal are at any risk of infection, and that risk is believed to be minimal at this time. All of those individuals have been notified and are being followed up with appropriately by health officials.

While anthrax is not an uncommon finding in livestock in Western states, this is unusual for Indiana. BOAH's historic records do not indicate the last time this disease was found in the state.

[In response to various questions, Denise replied as follows:]

1. The notification date is?
A: The initial lab report came to us late on 29 Nov [2016]; we reported it publicly on 1 Dec [2016].

2. November is way outside the normal anthrax season. What is the working cause/source for this case?
A: Anthrax itself is outside of normal for Indiana! We are trying to look through historical records and consult with older veterinarians to see if anyone knows when we last had a case here in our state. So, the time of year really does not cause a blip on our radar, as we are not accustomed to this organism any time of year. We do not know the cause or source. Our epi team is working on that.

3. How many anthrax outbreaks have you had in 2016?
A: As I said before, none! We do not have any knowledge of the last case in the state.

4. Was this outbreak in a part of the state known to be at risk of anthrax?
A: As you can imagine, we have not considered any part of our state as at risk of anthrax. This is a totally new diagnosis -- at least in recent history.

5. Lastly, when posting such reports I like to give the address for the digital version so our members check themselves check on what has been posted. May I have the link?
A: We have not posted this online. Our general web address is <www.boah.in.gov>. We are trying to determine what/how to provide anthrax info on our website to avoid raising undue stress or negative attention. This is a new one for us and, as you can imagine, we have a lot of concern about public perception on this organism that conjures up thoughts of white powder and envelopes. We are taking an educate-the-producer approach. [Don't bother. The site lacks news releases. - Mod.MHJ]

[In further discussion I suggested that they check whether the farmer had been doing any digging or excavations. If so he might have upturned an old anthrax grave. Or dredged a pond or stream, ditto. The only other obvious check is whether he had bought any hay or silage to feed his cows and it was contaminated. Easy check on the farm of origin and what had happened there.

Denise replied that those are certainly things they are investigating. "We 'picked the brains' of some of our counterparts in the Dakotas, since they have walked this road many times before! They made all those suggestions."

And lastly: It may be too late now but we have seen incidents of "silent" anthrax where the only evidence of anthrax activity is of the presence of antibodies in the sera of healthy animals in the group. This was best seen in Wood Bison up in the Canadian Northwest Territories where they annually dart animals in March looking for animals with any evidence of Brucella reactors. And lo and behold every now and again they find an animal with anthrax antibodies in an area where there had been the usual intense aerial surveillance during the previous summer when looking for dead bison, and none seen.

It may be a mite too late if the herd has been already vaccinated. But go back and rebleed them. Any animal with a previous exposure will have had an anamnesic response to the vaccine and a much higher titre than animals with no prior experience and just vaccinated for the first time. The titre will be much, much higher in the silent cases. And she is going to see what might be possible.

A puzzler.

This retrospective serological search can be done for a number of diseases at the annual spring herd revaccination. We first noticed it when horses were bled before being vaccinated against eastern equine encephalitis. Virus exposed horses had titres greater than 1:600, compared to the unexposed with titres around 1:80. You can even demonstrate an anamnesic response in goats previously fed Sterne vaccine with zero response but a beautiful titre when challenged with injected vaccine. The goats not fed Sterne just had the usual low titre vaccine response. - Mod.MHJ
