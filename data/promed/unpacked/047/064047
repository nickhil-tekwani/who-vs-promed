The Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole, has said the current outbreak of Lassa fever has affected 15 states with 105 laboratory confirmed cases, 3 probable cases, and 31 deaths.

Adewole, who made this known at the Emergency National Council of Health in Abuja on [Mon 5 Feb 2017], said that in 2018 alone, Nigeria recorded 77 cases of Lassa fever.

According to him, the cases were in Bauchi, Plateau, Taraba, Nasarawa, Benue, Kogi, Ebonyi, Rivers, Imo, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Ondo, Osun, and Lagos states.

The minister said 10 health care workers were affected in 4 states; 7 in Ebonyi with one health worker each from Nasarawa , Kogi, and Benue states.

Adewole said of the 31 deaths from Lassa fever outbreak, 4 health workers died as a result of the disease; 3 deaths were recorded in Ebonyi and one in Kogi.

The minister, therefore, said the meeting was summoned to discuss the state of public health challenges in Nigeria with focus on some the challenges that bedevilled the nation in the past few weeks.

Adewole added that Lassa fever has been a current outbreak in the country, stressing that Nigeria has battled with series of outbreaks in the past few months.

According to the minister, Nigeria dealt with Ebola in 2014; the country reacted strongly and the response was acknowledged by the international community. "The success against Ebola created a situation whereby every other public health challenge in Nigeria to be a tea party. "Therefore assume that Lassa fever and other challenges would be likened to malaria, that they were not serious,'' he said.

He said Lassa fever has been persistent in the country over the past 30 years.

The minister, therefore, appealed to the Nigeria Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) and other research institutes to look into the changing dynamics of Lassa fever. "Lassa fever use to occur only during dry season but now we are contending with an all year transmission of Lassa fever.

"NIMR director-general, other research institutes will need to find out whether we are dealing with new strain of Lassa fever virus in the country," Adewole said.

He also urged state governments and other key stakeholders to work closely with Nigeria Centre of Disease Control [NCDC] to address outbreak of diseases.

The meeting was attended by a number of state Commissioners for Health and FCT [Federal Capital Territory] health secretariat. Participants at the meeting renewed their commitments to work with federal government facilities in their states to enhance disease surveillance and disease response programmes.

[In the previous Nigeria CDC information release, they indicated that "since the beginning of 2018, 80 cases have been classified as: 77 confirmed cases, 3 probable cases with 21 deaths." The report above indicating 105 confirmed cases with 31 deaths in 15 states may also include cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in 2017. In any event, Lassa fever continues to be a significant public health problem in Nigeria this year (2018). The deaths of healthcare workers is of special concern.

As noted in the previous posts, cases of Lassa fever in Nigeria continue to increase. In Lassa fever endemic areas of Nigeria, the current 6-month dry season is when most cases occur. One can expect additional cases this year (2018) up through June 2018, and sporadic cases thereafter. Lassa fever remains a problem in Nigeria because the virus is endemic there. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta. Rodent control has to be undertaken at the village level with individual households. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients, as happened with the cases of the 10 healthcare workers mentioned in the 1st report above. Early in the course of Lassa fever, patients present with a general febrile disease with symptoms common to a variety of infections, including malaria, making it more difficult for healthcare workers to know when personal protective equipment should be used.

The Nigeria NCDC and its EOC (Emergency Operations Centre) are actively dealing with the state healthcare personnel in the affected states currently.
