A preliminary report on a cluster of cases with unexplained encephalopathy
in Israel -- association with a lack of thiamine in a soy-based infant formula.
On 6 Nov 2003, a report of a cluster of 4 cases of unexplained
encephalopathy in infants aged 2-10 months was received by the Israel
Ministry of Health from Schneider Children's Medical Center for Children in
the center of Israel. The striking common denominator was that they were
being fed exclusively a soy-based infant formula, manufactured in Germany
by Humana, especially prepared for the Israeli market and distributed by
the company "Remedia" under the name "Remedia Soy Formula". An expert
committee set up by the Ministry of Health debated a number of possible
etiologies including infection, poisoning (heavy metals, etc.), or
micronutrient deficiencies in the infant formula. On 7 Nov 2003, 2 further
cases with unexplained neurological signs and fed the same infant formula
were reported. A tentative diagnosis of vitamin B1-deficiency was
suggested, and administration of B1 preparation to one milder case resulted
in some improvement. On the same day the Ministry of Health issued an alert
to stop using this brand of formula, and the product was withdrawn from
stores and use in hospitals.
On Sun 9 Nov 2003, results of laboratory analyses of 3 batches of the
Remedia Soy Formula showed that vitamin B1 levels were undetectable, thus
strengthening the clinical impression that the cases resulted from severe
vitamin B1 deficiency. According to the company, changes were made in this
infant formula in March 2003, and the product was probably marketed in
Israel from April 2003. A retrospective study of infants hospitalized since
April 2003 due to unexplained encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, metabolic
acidosis, and convulsions -- and who were fed this infant formula -- is
currently under way. The cases thus far identified are aged 2-10 months.
Initial symptoms have included restlessness, vomiting, diarrhea, apathy,
convulsions, and coma. In some cases severe metabolic acidosis was
recorded. According to the initial clinical data available, none of the
patients had meningeal signs, and CSF findings and ammonia levels were
normal. Brain imaging findings were normal on CT, but MRI in some patients
revealed diffuse damage in the white and grey matter and severe damage in
the basal ganglia.
The Ministry of Health has directed that parents of infants who were fed
this infant formula during the past 2 months should report to their
physicians and the infant be given a 2-week supplementary oral dose of
vitamin B1. Thus far 15 cases including 2 deaths have been identified. This
is a very preliminary figure, since data are still being collected from all
hospitals. These findings will be updated as soon as the data collection
and analyses have been completed.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Kaluski and Dr. Green for this
authoritative report on the status of the investigation of this
outbreak. We have changed the title of this thread, as the clinical
syndromes observed in this current incident are not restricted to
encephalopathy but rather include cardiomyopathy and metabolic
acidosis. The expressions of clinical disease seen in this outbreak are
compatible with thiamine deficiency in infants -- the spectrum includes
neurologic and cardiac manifestations.
Concurrent with this investigation is an alert issued by the New York City
Department of Health. This was issued to health care practitioners on 9
Nov 2003, with outreach into communities within New York City where this
product might be in use. There is a general health alert available at the
New York City Department of Health website:
<http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/html/doh/html/public/press03/pr153-1110.html>
Borrowing from the excellent background material on thiamine deficiency
provided in the health care providers alert of the New York City Department
of Health:
"Vitamin B1 deficiency (beri-beri): Primary thiamine (vitamin B1)
deficiency or beri-beri occurs when there is an inadequate dietary intake
of thiamine. Beri-beri causes cardiovascular and neurological
disease. The onset of symptoms is often rapid and the fatality rate can be
high. The neurological form often begins with symptoms that include
apathy, irritability, sleep disturbances, vomiting, and
constipation. Later symptoms include convulsions and loss of
consciousness. There are 8 clinically recognizable syndromes -- 5 in
adults (including Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis) and
3 in children. Often a patient has features of more than one of the
syndromes. The pediatric forms include:
Infantile encephalitic beri-beri (sometimes called "pseudomeningeal"
beri-beri) -- This usually occurs in 6-12 month-old infants and is the
equivalent of Wernicke's encephalopathy in adults. The patient appears to
have meningoencephalitis. There is nystagmus, muscle twitching, a bulging
fontanelle, convulsions, and loss of consciousness. This can be confused
with all forms of encephalitis and meningitis, malaria, and even acute
vitamin A intoxication.
Infantile acute cardiac beri-beri -- The peak prevalence of this form
occurs in breast-fed infants aged 1-3 months. The first signs appear like
colic with screaming bouts, restlessness, anorexia, and vomiting. This
progress to edema, cyanosis, and shortness of breath with signs of heart
failure. Increased pulse rate, enlargement of the heart, systolic murmurs,
pulmonary edema, liver enlargement, and low urine volume. Pneumonia and
septicemia are commonly confused with this form of beri-beri.
Aphonic beri-beri -- The peak prevalence is in 4-6 month-old children. The
child's voice changes so that the cry gets more and more hoarse until no
sound is produced. These children appear to be crying without any noise.
Without treatment they progress over a few days to restlessness, edema,
breathlessness, and then death.
The treatment for beri-beri is thiamine supplementation. Infants may be
safely treated with adult doses (it is not toxic in very large
quantities). For severely ill children, give 50 mg of thiamine
hydrochloride slowly, and watch for response; if no response in several
hours consider a repeat dose. Intravenous treatment should be followed by
a daily oral or intramuscular dose of 10 mg of thiamine for 1-2 weeks. The
response to acute cardiac beri-beri may be rapid, with a diuresis starting
between 4 and 48 hours after the thiamine, with visible resolution of much
of the edema over the next 4 to 8 hours, followed by complete loss over the
next 48 hours. The convulsions and delirium in encephalitic patients
respond rapidly to treatment. However, the cranial nerve lesions can take
months to recover and may be permanent. Aphonia gradually resolves over 2
to 3 weeks.
For children who have been fed this formula without other sources of
vitamin B1, oral supplementation with 10 mg per day should be considered
for 1-2 weeks."
More information on this event is awaited. - Mod.MPP]
