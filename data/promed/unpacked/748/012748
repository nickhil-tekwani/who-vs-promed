A total of 35 farms in Belgium have been affected by a [strain] of avian influenza that is harmless to humans, the country's agriculture department says. Since the beginning of April [2019], several poultry farms, mainly located in West Flanders, have been affected by a bird flu virus.

The Federal Minister for Agriculture Denis Ducarme emphasises that the virus in question is 'completely harmless to human health'. Moreover, the virus in question - bird flu virus of the H3 type - is not on the list of regulated and notifiable diseases.

The virus can cause symptoms in poultry, ranging from a fall in production to death.

[According to OIE's 2018 edition of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (Terrestrial Code), "avian influenza" is defined as an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus with high pathogenicity (HPAI), and by H5 and H7 subtypes with low pathogenicity (H5/H7 LPAI). Serologically, the influenza A viruses include 16 haemagglutinin (H1-16) and 9 neuraminidase (N1-9) subtypes. In previous versions of the Terrestrial manuals, HPAI and H5/H7 LPAI viruses were termed "notifiable avian influenza" viruses, but because of inconsistencies with usage of the term "notifiable" with other diseases in the Terrestrial Code, the terms "notifiable avian influenza", "high pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza" and "low pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza" have been removed from the Terrestrial Code and the Terrestrial Manual. To avoid confusion with the scientific use of "avian influenza", which began in 1955, in the 2018 Terrestrial Manual the terms HPAI, H5/H7 LPAI and influenza A are used. The latter indicates any influenza virus from birds that is H1-H16.

According to the above, it apparently may be concluded that the H3 strain identified in 35 West Flanders poultry farms would currently be termed by OIE as "Influenza A virus", similarly to the terminology which would be applied for other non-H5 and non-H7, low pathogenic influenza A viruses (i.e. H1-4, H6 and H8-16); all are not notifiable. OIE's confirmation of the said, or otherwise, will be helpful.
