Biologists believe a herpes outbreak is killing hundreds of fish in
Echo Park Lake. At least 200 dead fish were recovered from the lake
this week, most of them carp. The fish have been found floating
belly-up in the water. "The water doesn't smell great. The fish don't
look super healthy," Peter Kavanaugh told KTLA while sitting next to the lake.

California Fish and Game officials suspect the Koi herpesvirus is
infecting the carp. The disease spreads from carp to carp but not to
other species. The trout, bass and sunfish are all very healthy. The
exact cause of the deaths remains a mystery.

Carp are an invasive species that damage the environment and cause
overcrowding, so the die-off may not be a bad thing. But biologists
say what's causing the carp to get sick may be concerning. It could
be overcrowding, water temperature changes and possibly pollution
factors that could put other wildlife at risk.

[It appears that it could be Koi herpesvirus, since only carp are
affected, and carp are a type of koi. If some of the dead fish are
submitted to a diagnostic laboratory, then the exact cause of death
of these fish may more likely be found.

Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or
CyHV-3, is a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing
significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_). In many countries, the common carp is a foodfish and also
has been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry, where it
is known as koi. Almost all countries have reported KHV, which was
1st recognized in 1996 in England. However, publications (Pokorova et
al) in 2005 report that Australia does not have the disease.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass
mortality within 1-2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass
mortality, the other common signs are white patches or necrosis of
the gills. Other clinical signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and
secondary bacterial infection or parasite infestation.

There is no treatment for KHV. Prevention is the key. For cultured
fish, inquiring about any mortalities may give a buyer a clue that
some fish may be carriers.
