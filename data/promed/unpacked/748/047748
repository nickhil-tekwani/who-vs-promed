CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Cyclospora_ infections linked to bagged salad mix containing iceberg lettuce, carrots, and red cabbage produced by Fresh Express and purchased at ALDI, Hy-Vee, Jewel-Osco, and Walmart stores in the Midwestern USA.

Since the last update on 23 Jun 2020, 84 new laboratory-confirmed _Cyclospora_ infections have been reported, including 6 from a new state, North Dakota. Health officials in North Dakota interviewed ill people in their state. In interviews, all 6 ill people reported eating a salad purchased from a single restaurant location in North Dakota. Health officials determined that the restaurant used Marketside brand bagged garden salad mix purchased from Walmart.

On 25 Jun 2020, Fresh Express recalled Marketside brand Classic Iceberg Salad sold in 12-ounce and 24-ounce bags at Walmart stores in Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

As of 25 Jun 2020, a total of 206 people with laboratory-confirmed _Cyclospora_ infections associated with this outbreak have been reported from 8 states: Illinois (57), Iowa (74), Kansas (1), Minnesota (25), Missouri (10), Nebraska (20), North Dakota (6), and Wisconsin (13). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 11 May 2020 to 17 Jun 2020. Ill people range in age from 16 to 92 years with a median age of 60, and 57% are female. Of 198 people with available information, 23 people (12%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 4 to 6 weeks. If the number of cases reported by CDC is different from the number reported by state or local health officials, data reported by local jurisdictions should be considered the most up to date. Any differences may be due to the timing of reporting and website updates.

There are typically multiple clusters of _Cyclospora_ infections that occur each summer. CDC is working to determine if other recent cases of _Cyclospora_ infection are linked to contaminated ingredients in these bagged salad mixes. This investigation is ongoing.

[Cyclosporiasis (https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/) is an intestinal illness caused by the microscopic parasite _Cyclospora cayetanensis_. People can become infected with _Cyclospora_ by consuming food or water contaminated with the parasite. People living or traveling in countries where cyclosporiasis is endemic may be at increased risk of infection. Infected people shed unsporulated (non-infective; immature) _C. cayetanensis_ oocysts in their stool; immature oocysts usually require at least 1 to 2 weeks under favorable laboratory conditions to sporulate and become infective.

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis begin an average of 7 days (range, 2 days to 2 weeks or longer) after ingestion of sporulated oocysts (the infective form of the parasite).

Symptoms of cyclosporiasis may include the following:
- Watery diarrhea (most common)
- Loss of appetite
- Weight loss
- Cramping
- Bloating
- Increased gas
- Nausea
- Fatigue

Other symptoms that may occur but are less common include the following:
- Vomiting
- Low-grade fever

If a person ill from cyclosporiasis is not treated, symptoms can persist for several weeks to a month or more. Some symptoms, such as diarrhea, can return; some symptoms, such as fatigue, may continue after the gastrointestinal symptoms have gone away. The infection usually is not life-threatening. Some infected persons do not have any symptoms, particularly persons from areas where cyclosporiasis is endemic, such as tropical and subtropical regions. - Mod.LL
