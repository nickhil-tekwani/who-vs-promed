Maize streak mastrevirus - Kenya (West) 20010414.0743

[A recent ProMED-mail posting contained this quote from the East African
Standard:
"An acute outbreak of maize streak disease has hit Kakamega and
Butere/Mumias districts. The Western Provincial Crops Officer, Mr. Jacob
Odondi, said yesterday the disease was spreading at an alarming rate.
The disease, which started in Kabras division, [poses a food security
threat in the province and [Odondi appealed for assistance in curbing it.
[He said the disease may have been brought into the area by poor quality
seeds supplied by unscrupulous traders."
[Maize streak mastrevirus (MSV) is transmitted only by several leafhopper
species in the genus _Cicadulina_, most commonly _C. mbila_. The
suggestion that "poor quality seeds supplied by unscrupulous traders" may
have brought the disease to the affected areas is unlikely because MSV is
not seed-borne or seed-transmitted. A useful reference on the disease and
its management can be found at the following URL:
<http://www.isaaa.org/publications/briefs/Brief_16.htm> - Mod.DH
The suggestion that contaminated seed was responsible is especially serious
when a Crops Officer makes it; having travelled quite extensively in
Western Kenya with a number of Kenya Agricultural Research Institute
personnel, I can testify that this serious lack of knowledge of the
causation of a common maize disease is not typical! The food shortage is
probably exacerbated by the still-ongoing cassava mosaic disease
epiphytotic which spread out of Uganda a few years ago.
I can also testify that the disease is not seed-transmitted: as yet
unpublished collaborative work done in South Africa by Dr Bradley Flett and
helpers showed that no MSV could be detected by PCR in 100 000 plantlets
derived from seed from heavily-infected maize plants.
More information on the virus disease, as well as pictures of the virus and
symptoms it produces in susceptible maize in Kenya can be found at the

[Ed Rybicki's comments are right to the point. I can add that municipal
authorities make statements which are often unfounded. I appreciate
receiving the information on the absence of detectable MSV in seed from
maize heavily infected with MSV. - Mod.DH
