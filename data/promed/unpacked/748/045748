Health authorities have confirmed the State's latest food poisoning
outbreak. By Wednesday night, tests had confirmed that six people had been
infected by a rare strain of _Salmonella_. Sixty-eight additional cases
have been confirmed to date.
There are normally fewer than two cases of this particular strain,
_Salmonella typhimurium_ phage type 135A, in South Australia each year. The
report was confirmed yesterday by Human Services Department's executive
director, Professor Brendon Kearney.
