An FAO/World Food Program Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission visited
southern Sudan from 10 October to 3 November 1999 and northern Sudan from
24 November to 13 December to estimate the 1999 cereal production and to
make an early forecast of wheat production from areas now being planted.
The Mission was able to visit 24 out of the 26 States in both Government
and rebel-held areas. Based on these production estimates and an estimate
of carryover stocks, the Mission assessed the overall cereal supply
situation, including food aid needs for the 1999/2000 marketing year
(November/October).
Cereals are the main staple crops of Sudan with sorghum providing around 65
percent of the total cereal consumed. Only in the Southern States are other
carbohydrate foodstuffs, particularly cassava and sweet potatoes, used in
significant quantities. Sorghum, millet and maize are grown throughout the
country during the rainy season from April to October. During the winter
months from November to March, wheat is grown in irrigation schemes and
small, but locally significant, areas of maize are grown under traditional
hand-cultivation systems in riverine areas in the south from the residual
moisture left by receding floods.
The Mission noticed serious outbreaks of sorghum smut in the Gash spate
(very high moisture) scheme where seed treatment had apparently failed and
in the traditional hand-cultivated schemes in the southern states where
seed treatment is not available. Also in the southern states, cassava
mosaic disease is universally present wherever cassava is grown, further
exacerbating food insecurity.
In the rain-fed sector most farmers used their own seeds carried over from
the 1998/99 harvest which they "home-treat" against smut, whereas in the
irrigated sectors most farmers used seeds obtained on credit from the
schemes' management. Such seeds are improved, treated against smut and are
twice the price of ordinary sorghum.
Most farmers in the irrigation schemes used certified seeds from seed
multiplication units in Gezira. These improved seeds had been treated for
smut and were supplied under delayed payment schemes along with fertilizers.
Seed treatment against sorghum smut was universally practised in the Region
but its effectiveness was noted as a problem. On-farm seed treatment using
"souq"-purchased chemicals leaves much to be desired from the point of view
of both safety and effectiveness.
With an estimated cereal production of 3.9 million tonnes and forecasted
imports of wheat (680 000 tonnes) and rice (38 000 tonnes), Sudan's cereal
requirement of about 5.2 million tonnes in 1999/2000 is expected to be met
by a withdrawal of nearly 240 000 tonnes from the reserve supply.
For the various interventions in southern Sudan, war-affected and
food-deficit regions in the northern states, it is estimated that 103 500
tonnes of emergency food aid will be required during 2000.
