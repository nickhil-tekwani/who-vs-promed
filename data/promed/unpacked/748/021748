RE: Equine herpesvirus, equine - USA: (NY) Cornell University 20110402.1021
--------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 9 described equine herpesviruses and it is not clear from
this posting which virus has been detected. I presume that this is
EHV-1, but again it is unclear whether this virus has been detected
from a case of respiratory disease, abortion, neurological disease, or
from an asymptomatic horse in the hospital for treatment of a
different complaint. If EHV-1 has been detected it would be of
interest to report whether it is a strain that has the SNP in the
polymerase gene that has been associated with an increased likelihood
of CNS disease.

The ProMed report as it reads now is not helpful to the reader, as
EHV (1,2,4 and 5 especially) are commonly detected, sometimes even in
clinically normal horses.

[Dr. Gilkerson is correct that the press release by Cornell
University was missing important information on the type of equine
herpesvirus involved. I sought vainly and unsuccessfully to find an
answer to this question yesterday. However, ProMED-mail readers are
not the only ones wanting to know what type of virus. Only a Blog post
identifies it as EHV-1. It is indeed dismaying that Cornell's own
press release left this information out. If it was released earlier, I
could not find that information on the Cornell Web site. - Mod.TG]

Equine barns at Cornell University Hospital for Animals quarantined
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In cooperation with the New York State Veterinarian, Cornell
University Hospital for Animals has placed its equine barns under
voluntary quarantine with restricted access and biosecurity protocols
in place.

The quarantine was in response to a confirmed case of equine
herpesvirus, a virus that routinely circulates in the general horse
population. Movement of animals between the equine barns and other
Cornell facilities is not permitted.

The diagnosis of equine herpesvirus does not affect the Companion
Animal or Farm Animal Hospital. These hospitals remain open and
operating under normal conditions, as equine herpesvirus does not
affect dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, or birds. Alpacas and
llamas, which might be affected, also are restricted.

Horses discharged from the Cornell Equine Hospital prior to 18 Mar
2011 were not exposed to the known cases at the hospital.

Cornell University has voluntarily quarantined its equine hospital in
response to a confirmed case of equine herpesvirus type 1 infection.
This virus is widely present in the horse population, although in most
infected horses it lays dormant in the body and they are not
infectious. Horses are usually infected when they are young, and
usually there are no problems, but it can cause a variety of diseases,
including abortion, neurological disease and severe infection in
newborn foals. Diagnosing a case, particularly in a large facility
like a racetrack, causes a lot of angst because of the potential for
outbreaks. Usually, it only causes sporadic disease with cases in
single horses, but outbreaks of various sizes can occur.

Equine hospitals are always at risk of infectious disease outbreaks
because, by their nature, they bring in sick horses. Infection control
measures are designed to reduce the risk of transmission of infections
in a hospital, but you can never eliminate risk.

Little specific information is provided by Cornell's release. It is
apparent that a horse with herpesvirus infection was admitted 18 Mar
2011, since they state that horses that were discharged before that
date were not exposed. The type of disease the infected horse had is
not stated, nor is there information about whether there was potential
widespread exposure of horses in the facility or whether it was
isolated. Presumably, it was not housed in isolation, or I doubt there
would have been this type of response. Ideally, we house infected
horses in isolation, but horses don't always come in with "I have
herpesvirus" written all of them, and it's possible to have a horse in
the hospital before realizing the risk.

At this point, there's no evidence provided that any other horses
were infected. Presumably, tracing of contacts and testing is underway
to determine the scope of the problem. The facility is closing to all
but emergency equine cases and cases that would be housed in
isolation. This makes it easier to contain the problem by facilitating
care, testing and isolation of exposed animals and by reducing the
number of new, susceptible animals (less fuel for the fire). Alpacas
and llamas (and presumably donkeys) are included in the quarantine
since they are also susceptible to the virus. It's business as usual
for other species since they are not at risk.

Hopefully this is just a responsible proactive quarantine in a
situation where an outbreak underway and won't develop. This type of
response is the appropriate and ethical thing to do if there is
reasonable evidence that transmission might have occurred or might be
ongoing. It's a tough decision to make. I've been involved in
discussions about hospital closure both here and with other
facilities, and it's not an easy discussion. Too often, people use the
'maybe it will just go away' approach to infection control, and use
hope rather than infection control as a way to prevent or contain an
outbreak. That's a major reason that we've seen large outbreaks of
disease in equine facilities in the past. (Not all outbreaks as caused
by inadequate response, but it certainly played a role in many).

Not too many years ago, the typical response to an event like this
would be have 'let's see what happens.' Usually, nothing would happen,
which re-enforces the behaviour. But, when things happen, they can be
very bad. People are realizing more and more that an aggressive
infection control response, while accompanied by hassles, economic
costs, complaints and negative publicity, is the right thing to do.

appreciated. - Mods.TG/MPP]
