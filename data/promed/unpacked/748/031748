Two returning Canadian travelers were diagnosed with _Plasmodium vivax_
malaria in January 2000, shortly after returning from a vacation in Cancun,
Mexico.These individuals resided in Cancun City between 24 Dec 1999 and 7
Jan 2000. While one had been in India in 1996, the other had never traveled
to a vivax [endemic area except Cancun in January and March, 1999. Other
than the city of Cancun and the adjacent beach resort area, they did not
travel to any other sites or any rural location. A large group of their
friends and relatives continue to reside in Cancun and have reported rumors
of many other cases in the Cancun resort area. The two travelers have
responded to chloroquine therapy and are initiating terminal treatment with
Primaquine. The individuals still residing in Cancun remain asymptomatic
and have been provided with chloroquine prophylaxis. To our knowledge no
other confirmed cases of malaria have been reported from Cancun.
According to the CDC <http://www.cdc.gov/travel/camerica.htm>, antimalarial
drugs are not recommended for travel to the major resort areas on the
Pacific and Gulf coasts. Prior to our report only rural areas of a number
of states were considered at risk for malaria. As per the WHO
<http://www.who.int/ith/english/mexico.htm>, malaria risk is almost
exclusively of the benign [less severe form (_P. vivax_) and exists
throughout the year in rural areas not often visited by tourists. There is
certainly the possibility that these two cases are autochthonous.
Entomological studies will be necessary to clarify this.It is clear to us
that local transmission is occurring. Based on the diagnosis of _P. vivax_
malaria in our two returning travelers, we now recommend that anyone
traveling to Cancun, Mexico be advised to take chloroquine prophylaxis.
