Update: Preliminary epidemiological data
----------------------------------------
The outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in humans was first confirmed from cases
presenting with fever, headache, myalgia and hemetemis in patients admitted
to Provincial General Hospital, Garissa on 23 Dec 2006. The diagnosis was
confirmed as Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection by specific IgM
[assay] and PCR [amplification]. After the first cases were confirmed the
Ministry of Health (MOH), Centre for Disease Control (CDC) and the World
Health Organization sent a team to investigate and put in place control
measures to stop the spread of the disease.
Preliminary data show that 71 percent of all cases admitted with RVF were
males and 29 percent were females. Patients less then 20 years comprised
less then 3 percent. The age of male patients was 28 years while the mean
age of female patients was 33 years. The attack rate for Garissa district
was 19 per 100 000 people and the highest attack rate was in Shanta Abak at
129 cases per 100 000. The first cases were reported from Shanta Abak.
The commonest presenting features were fever, headache, muscle pains and
joint pains. The patients with severe disease had a bleeding tendency such
as hemetemesis, bleeding from the nose and gums. A total of 86 percent of
the patients interviewed said that they drank raw milk and 71 percent said
that they had drunk milk from a sick animal 2 weeks before onset of
symptoms. Most patients lived near a swampy area. In all, 71 percent of
patients had sick animals in their herds and 60 percent had lost an animal
due to disease 2 weeks prior to onset of symptoms; 53 percent had
slaughtered a sick animal while 53 percent reported they had eaten meat
from either a sick or a dead animal. Fifty-one percent of patients were
using a [mosquito] net.
Cases have now been reported from other parts of North Eastern Province
such as Ijara, Garissa and also in 2 districts of Coast Province (Tana
River and Kilifi District). Cumulative figures as of 5 Jan 2007 are 188
cases with 68 deaths.
The Government has imposed a quarantine for animals in North Eastern
Province and also imposed a ban on slaughtering animals at home. The
Ministry of Health with CDC, WHO, UNICEF and the Red Cross have mounted an
intensive health education program using electronic media, religious
leaders and health workers to tell people to avoid contact with sick
animals, to stop drinking raw milk and to stop eating meat from sick or
dead animals. It has started distributing insecticide treated nets and
indoor residual spraying and larviciding stagnant pools of water.

On [Thu] 4 Jan 2007, 8 new suspected cases of Rift Valley fever were
discovered by Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) teams in the Ijara District in
the North-Eastern Province of Kenya. One of the patients died, taking the
death toll to at least 67 since the outbreak began on 7 Dec 2006. MSF
started battling the outbreak on 22 Dec 2006 when teams began work in the
town of Garissa, setting up facilities to care for patients in the hospital
in which 23 people had been treated for their Rift Valley fever infection.
Today, MSF teams are working in Garissa, Ijara and Tano River providing
information, trying to locate infected people and treating patients.
Rift Valley fever is a rare viral disease of which very little is known.
Transmitted primarily to humans through contact with infected animal
matter, such as blood or other fluids, or organs, it is also spread from
livestock via _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Consumption of raw milk, an important
element in the diet of many nomadic pastoralists of the area, is also
thought to lead to infection.
The epidemic has been triggered by extensive flooding in the region. [A map
of the flooded areas of Kenya, where conditions may be favorable for the
spread of Rift Valley fever, is available at:
<http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/fullMaps_Af.nsf/luFullMap/C1A04D85AE229930852572290055544F/$File/ocha_FL_hoa061116.pdf?OpenElement>.

The infected mosquito eggs are often laid around river banks and can lay
dormant for years until they get submerged. Once covered with water, the
eggs become infected mosquitoes which spread the virus. The last large
outbreak in the same region was in 1997, also following heavy rains. During
that time in Garissa District, around 27 500 were infected and 170 died.
Only about one percent of people contracting Rift Valley fever develop the
disease in a severe form. But of those who do, around half will die.
"The great majority of people infected just suffer from headaches and
influenza-like symptoms reminiscent of malaria," explains MSF emergency
coordinator Dr Ian Vanenglegem, "but the severe form, like other
haemorrhagic diseases, attacks the liver and can cause the patient to bleed
from every orifice. There is no cure, so we are only able to treat the
symptoms."
One of the biggest challenges of dealing with this outbreak is logistical.
"Much of Kenya's North-Eastern Province is not accessible by road because
of the floods, so the only way we can find patients is to travel by
helicopter," continues Dr Vanenglegem. [An interactive map is available at
<http://www.alertnet.org/map/index.htm?ct=2&style=2&ex_iso=ET,KE,SO,SD,TZ,UG&pcode>
- Mod.CP]
"Just to reach the Masalani hospital in Ijara can take up to 3 days by
road. It is estimated that up to 500 000 people are at risk from infection
and this population is scattered over a vast area. We are sure that the
number of cases discovered is only the tip of the iceberg."
Another difficulty is the fear of the outbreak among the population. With
such a high death rate among those contracting the severe form of the
disease, many people will see no benefit in making the often long journey
to a health centre. To counter this, MSF teams are undertaking
awareness-raising activities to increase understanding of what Rift Valley
fever is and what measures people should take themselves. "This is an
important concern because it is likely that, with the flood waters being a
perfect breeding ground for mosquitoes, this outbreak will be followed to
by high numbers of malaria infections. The initial symptoms may be similar
to those of Rift Valley fever. If people are too scared to come to health
centres, or simply don't see the point, then there may be even more
unnecessary deaths," concludes Dr Vanenglegem.

[The outbreak of Rift Valley fever in the North Eastern Province of Kenya
continues to develop. The number of confirmed deaths has risen from the 54
reported on Wed 3 Jan 2007, to 67 reported by MSF on Thu 4 Jan 2007, and
now to the 68 reported by Dr. Sharif in the above report. Dr. Sharif also
reports that the outbreak is now affecting 2 districts of the Coast
Province of Kenya as well as the initial 3 districts of North Eastern
province (see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Kenya-relief-map-towns.jpg>.
Preliminary data suggest that unusually the disease is spreading in the
human population through the consumption of raw milk from sick animals and
that transmission by mosquitoes may not yet be a determining factor. This
circumstance may enable the local authorities to control the outbreak in
the human population by vector control measures. - Mod.CP]
