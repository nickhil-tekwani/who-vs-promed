The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended vaccine strains
for the 2010--11 Northern Hemisphere trivalent influenza vaccine, and
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has made the same
recommendations for influenza vaccine composition for the United
States. Both agencies recommend that vaccines contain
A/California/7/2009-like (2009 H1N1), A/Perth/16/2009-like (H3N2),
and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) viruses.

A seasonal influenza A (H1N1) component is not included in the
2010--11 formulation, and the A (H3N2) component has been changed
from A/Brisbane/59/2007 in the 2009--10 Northern Hemisphere vaccine
formulation. This recommendation was based on surveillance data
related to epidemiology and antigenic characteristics, serologic
responses to 2009--10 trivalent seasonal and 2009 H1N1 monovalent
vaccines, and the availability of candidate strains and reagents (1).

[Vaccination with 2009 H1N1 vaccine remains the key strategy for
prevention of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection. Although national
influenza activity has decreased substantially since peak activity in
October 2009, the persistence of sustained transmission in some areas
(resulting in additional cases, hospitalizations, and deaths)
emphasizes the importance of a continued focus on vaccination of
initial target groups as well as the rest of the susceptible
population.

The FDA statement makes clear that the influenza pandemic A(H1N1)
strain will be included in the 2010/2011 northern hemisphere vaccine
as the seasonal influenza A (H1N1) component. - Mod.CP]
