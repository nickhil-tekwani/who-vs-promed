A Side of Rabies With Your Dog Meat in China
--------------------------------------
People in China and other Asian countries are dying of rabies. But it's not because dogs are biting them -- it's because they are biting dogs, eating 18-80 million a year just in China.

"Rabies is a major problem in China. The country's Ministry of Health says it has the 2nd highest rate in the world after India." And it's getting worse. Human rabies cases appear to be on the rise in China based on the most recent numbers available. "In 2007, there were 3302 confirmed human rabies cases in China, nearly 21 times the number found from the entire period between 1990 and 1996."

It's not just eating the meat that causes rabies. Slaughtering, processing and cooking it may be even more dangerous. After a rabies outbreak led to human fatalities in Viet Nam, government officials "reported that 70 percent of deaths were from dog bites but up to 30 percent were thought to be linked to exposure during slaughter or butchery."

"In a 17 Mar [2009 -- see comment below] study from Hanoi published by the PLoS Medicine journal, researchers pointed to 2 cases of human rabies in Viet Nam where the patients were believed infected while butchering a rabid animal -- in one case a dog, the other a cat."

"In the 1st patient's case, he had prepared and eaten a dog that had been killed in a road traffic accident; rabid dogs were known to inhabit the neighbourhood. The 2nd patient had butchered and eaten a cat that had been sick for a number of days." Other people who ate the same meat did not fall ill.

According to the Welcome Trust rabies is a very serious -- and in nearly all cases fatal -- disease. It is estimated to kill over 30 000 people each year in Asia, and the number of cases in China and Viet Nam is increasing. Symptoms include agitation, severe spasms, fever, fear of water and inability to drink liquids, and eventually death. There is a vaccine for rabies and even a treatment that can [very rarely] cure the disease after infection, but it must be administered very quickly after the patient contracts rabies. "Once a person shows symptoms, the disease is almost invariably fatal."

[This report cites figures in support of an assertion that rabies virus infection is increasing in China and wishes to correlate this with increasing consumption of dog meat in China. In support of this contention the article cites 2 cases [which actually occurred in 2009 - Mod.CP] in Viet Nam where rabies was contracted by an individual slaughtering an accident-injured dog [see: Rabies, via dog/cat butchering - Viet Nam archive number 20090318.1092], and another slaughtering a cat.

Eating dog meat is common in many Asian countries, but research conducted as part of the South East Asia Infectious Diseases Clinical Research Network identified a potentially lethal risk associated with preparing dog meat. In research published on 18 Mar 2009 in the open access journal PLoS Medicine, Heiman Wertheim and colleagues from the National Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases and the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Hanoi, Viet Nam, report on 2 patients admitted to hospital showing signs of rabies infection. Neither patient was thought to have been bitten by a rabid animal in the preceding months see: Wertheim H, et al: Furious Rabies after an Atypical Exposure. PLoS Medicine. 17 Mar 2009 [available at
http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1000044]. It is clearly probable that rabies virus can be transmitted during the course of slaughtering and butchering dogs and cats, if the person involved has exposed abrasions or wounds. However, rabies virus cannot be transmitted through consumption of cooked meat since rabies virus (and related rhabdoviruses) are heat sensitive and rapidly lose infectivity at normal environmental temperature and humidity.

Vaccination and dog licensing are mechanism for controlling rabies virus infection, not banning consumption of dog meat. - Mod.CP
