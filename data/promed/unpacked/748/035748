Newfoundland and Labrador's provincial health department is advising residents of an outbreak of _E. coli_ bacteria. There have been 22 cases of _E. coli_ confirmed in the province this week, according to an advisory issued Friday afternoon [4 Oct 2019]. The statement says provincial public health officials and regional authorities are investigating.

The Department of Health and Community Services advises people experiencing symptoms of _E. coli_, including severe or bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, to seek medical attention. The illness spreads mostly through ingestion of contaminated food or water but can also spread through person-to-person contact.

A provincial medical officer of health says most cases are within the province's eastern health authority, including the capital city of St. John's, but others are in the central and western authorities.

Dr. Janice Fitzgerald said some of the cases are connected to an advisory issued by Memorial University earlier this week, saying Eastern Health was investigating reports of students experiencing gastrointestinal illness.

The university said Wednesday [2 Oct 2019] that test results indicated one student living in residence "may have contracted the _E. coli_ bacteria" and 21 students had reported similar symptoms. Fitzgerald said it's too early in the investigation to determine a cause of the outbreak.

[The news report above alerts people experiencing severe or bloody diarrhea to seek medical care because there have been 22 cases of a "gastrointestinal illness" due to _Escherichia coli_ in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador; most cases are occurring within the province's eastern health authority, including the capital city of St. John's.

Although the report fails to characterize the students' GI illness in any detail, most likely the illness is due to an enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). EHEC is a type of _E. coli_ that produces a toxin called Shiga toxin and causes damage to the lining of the intestinal wall and bloody diarrhea.

The infection is said to have involved one student "living in residence," perhaps a communal home, and 21 other students developed similar symptoms. But the report fails to say if the students lived together or had some other common exposure. Most EHEC is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated food or water, but EHEC can also spread through person-to-person contact or contact with animals and their environment (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/escherichia-coli-diarrheagenic).

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Newfoundland and Labrador, which incorporates the island of Newfoundland and mainland Labrador to the northwest, is the most easterly province of Canada, with a combined population of 526 702 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador). Approximately 92% of the province's population lives on the island of Newfoundland (including its associated smaller islands). Half of the province's population (262 410) lives on Newfoundland's Avalon Peninsula, which includes the city of St. John's, the province's capital and largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Peninsula). - Mod.ML
