Revision of Smallpox Vaccine Recommendations by CDC
---------------------------------------------------
ATLANTA: The question of how a vaccine against smallpox should be used in
the case of a bioterrorist attack is addressed in updated recommendations
for the use of the vaccine released by US government advisors. The new
draft guidelines, formulated by the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) revise recommendations made by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1991. "The biggest change since 1991 is the
inclusion of recommendations for use of the vaccine in bioterrorism
preparedness, or if smallpox were to reoccur in the form of an outbreak,"
said Dr. Lisa Rotz of the CDC.
A global vaccination program officially eliminated naturally occurring
smallpox from the world by 1980, and since then vaccination programs have
been stopped. Currently, only 2 laboratories are known to have smallpox
virus specimens; the CDC in Atlanta and a Russian state laboratory. But
there is speculation that other, secret, stocks of the virus are held in
other countries. Although the restricted availability of smallpox means it
is less likely than some other diseases to be used as a weapon, "its use
would have substantial public health consequences," the CDC experts write.
The new recommendations address use of the vaccine both before and after
release of the virus in a bioterrorist attack. Because the CDC considers
that the chances of a deliberate release of the virus are low, for most
people "the benefits of vaccination do not outweigh the risk of vaccine
complications," the guidelines state. Vaccination before a bioterrorist
attack is currently not recommended for anyone other than laboratory or
medical personnel working with the type of viruses that cause smallpox,
according to the guidelines.
If a smallpox attack did occur, vaccination is recommended for people
exposed to the initial release of smallpox virus, contacts of exposed
people and health care workers and laboratory workers involved with the
treatment of exposed individuals. Smallpox vaccination may decrease the
severity of the disease even when given up to 3 to 4 days after exposure.
The new recommendations also include research priorities for smallpox
prevention and treatment. These include development and evaluation of a new
vaccine to replenish current vaccine stores of Wyeth Laboratories' Dryvax,
the only available smallpox vaccine, whose production was discontinued in
1981.
