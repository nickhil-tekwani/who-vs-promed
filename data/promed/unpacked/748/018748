[The dengue situation in southeast Asia continues to surpass case counts from 2021 in multiple countries. For an interesting synopsis on the 3 key factors (rainfall, temperature, and humidity) driving dengue outbreak dynamics in India, please see https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/climate-change/is-it-climate-change-that-impacts-trajectory-of-dengue-in-india--85930. Bangladesh is also reporting this year (2022) as the 2nd-worst outbreak in 22 years, although the case fatality rate is on track to surpass that seen in 2019 (see graphic at https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/health/second-worst-dengue-outbreak-22-years-520686). The article also references the stark decline in case counts in 2020 during the global COVID-19 wave with only 1400 cases observed vs over 30 000 this year and over 28 000 in 2021. One wonders if this observed decline in case counts was artifact from lack of testing/reduced access to medical care, or truly due to altered human behaviors that somehow impacted mosquitos' collective ability to feed on hosts and/or climatic factors that negatively affected the mosquitos that year? - Mod.JH]
