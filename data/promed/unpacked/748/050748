A bird flu (H5N1) outbreak has occurred in Indonesia's Jambi
province, triggering the deaths of thousands of chickens in Kerinci
regency, Kompas.com online news reported on Wed [2 Feb 2011].

Secretary of Animal Husbandry, Division of Kerinci regency, Igor said
that at least 4164 chickens were killed due to the disease. "To
prevent spreading disease, the Animal Husbandry Division of Kerinci
regency is now working hard to supervise people and to spray
disinfectant," said Igor.

Head of Animal Health, Division of Kerinci regency, Ariyan admitted
that there are still many villagers who do not want to destroy their
chickens. "However, we keep supervising them," she said.

Indonesia and Egypt are the 2 countries where circulation of HPAI
virus H5N1 in animals and humans has been continuing for years. The
disease was officially declared endemic by the Indonesian authorities
in September 2006. It occurs in most parts of the country. Since the
beginning of the N1 outbreak in Indonesia in 2005, 171 human cases
have been reported, of which 141 died. The most recent human case was
reported in early December 2010 in Bandung City, West Java Province.
The most recent previous outbreak in poultry was, according to FAO
data, in November 2010.

To improve surveillance and control, the Indonesian authorities,
supported by international expertise, implemented the "participatory
disease surveillance and response" (PDSR) programme, which targets
village-type poultry production systems (mainly backyard) and reports
evidence of virus circulation in the village environment. According
to PDSR's data, in March 2010, Jambi was one of the provinces
reported infected. The overall HPAI incidence was 1.5 newly found
infected villages per 1000 villages in the coverage area, but
incidence varied widely between provinces. The 4 highest provinces
for incidence were Kepulauan Bangka Belitung (13.3), Yogyakarta
(9.1), Lampung (7.2) and Jambi (4.6) (see
<http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/ak756e/ak756e00.pdf>). - Mod.AS]
