Incessant rainfall has led to spread of basal rot disease in over 50% of shallot crops in Tiruchy and Perambalur districts. According to the respective Horticulture Departments of the 2 districts, in Tiruchy over 1000 hectares out of a total of 2000 hectares and in Perambalur over 40% out of a total 4400 hectares of the crops are, or are likely to be, affected by the disease.

A major part of the current harvest has been destroyed, and old stocks are depleting fast. This has driven up prices in local markets. The next crop is likely to be harvested in January 2022.

[A number of fungi can affect onion (_Allium cepa_; some varieties known as shallots) and related crops such as garlic (_A. sativum_) to cause root and basal rots. The term 'basal rot' is mostly used for species of _Fusarium_, but it is not clear whether an identification has been obtained since an outbreak of an unspecified root rot was reported in the area earlier (ProMED post 20210202.8156911). Species of _Phoma_, _Pythium_, _Rhizoctonia_, as well as some nematodes have also been reported to be associated with root rot symptoms.

Root rot diseases are usually soilborne and also spread with infected plant and other materials, including agricultural implements. They are generally favoured by wet conditions and are difficult to control. Disease management may include deep plowing, phytosanitation, and crop rotations of several years. For fungal rots, appropriate fungicide regimes may be helpful, but agrochemicals are often of limited use for soil-borne pathogens.
