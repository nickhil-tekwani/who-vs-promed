The Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] is advising well owners to check their wells. The Health Service Executive has warned of a growing number of cases of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) infection, which it says can be particularly serious.

Analysis of the cases shows people treated for this infection are 4 times more likely to have consumed untreated water from a private well.

The Environmental Protection Agency said well owners should check their wells to ensure they are not putting the health of their families or visitors at risk.

The introduction of water charges makes the prospect of drilling your own well more tempting, however, if it is not done properly the health consequences could be serious. EHEC can cause severe bloody diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, and sometimes results in life-long kidney problems.

There has been dramatic increase in the rate of infection number with 704 cases in 2013, 2.5 times more than in 2011, and Ireland has the highest incidence of EHEC in Europe.

The EPA has launched a new "Protect Your Well" assessment app on their web page [http://erc.epa.ie/water/wells/] to help well owners reduce their risk of contamination.

[Water for drinking, from wells or even municipal water sources, as well as recreational water for swimming have been sources for enterohemorrhagic _E. coli infections. With wells, especially if they are not well constructed, the water can be contaminated with fecal material from the animal hosts of the zoonotic bacillus. The primary carriers are cattle but can be deer, sheep, goats, and other livestock or wild animals. - Mod.LL
