[The Flutrackers web-site on SBV was launched on 6 Dec 2011, titled "Schmallenbergvirus: new Akabane-like virus in cattle, sheep and goats in Europe". The current update of 24 Feb 2012, is the 98th posting in the thread. This useful web-site is regularly updated.

The current update includes an SBV map of Europe; the map is reportedly based on FAO-Empres data. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the only electronically available map where one can see all 7 affected countries combined. The map can be seen also at
