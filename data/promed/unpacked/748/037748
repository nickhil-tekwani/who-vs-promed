MENINGITIS & INVASIVE MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTION - FLORIDA, USA
============================================================

Neisseria meningitidis disease in Okaloosa County.
Okaloosa County has had at least 5 confirmed cases of invasive meningococcal
disease since Dec 30. All have been in children and all are recovering. Two
of the children were siblings with simultaneous onset. Two others are
unrelated children at Eglin AFB [Air Force Base]. The Okaloosa CPHU [County
Public Health Unit?] is taking vigorous, well-targeted preventive action
with close contacts of cases.
Isolates so far have been of three different serogroups. Aside
from the two siblings, none of the other cases have been epi-linked. The
variety of serogroups is extremely important in confirming that the cases are
not connected. Why cases of several different serogroups would appear
simultaneously is not understood. Co-infection with another agent, such as
influenza virus, is a possible explanation.

[The UK recently reported several cases of invasive meningococcal disease.
Do any subscribers believe they are seeing more cases of invasive
disease than they would normally expect, based on historical data? - Mod.]
