Medical tests have confirmed that 2 physicians are infected with
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a disease carried by certain tick
species. The chief physician of Ankara Numune Hospital, where the 2 doctors
had treated a patient with complaints of a tick bite, verified yesterday
[13 Jun 2008] that the doctors have the disease after results came in from
blood samples. The disease is also known to be transmitted through direct
contact with the blood or secretions of an infected person. The doctors
were most likely infected by direct contact with the patient's blood when
it splashed into the doctors' eyes as they tried to stop the bleeding of
the patient's nose.

Blood samples have also been taken from a nurse and other health personnel
at the hospital and sent to the Refik Saydam Health Center for analysis.
The results will show whether or not the nurse and the other personnel have
CCHF, which has recently sparked fears throughout the country. The doctors
are already displaying symptoms of CCHF. Health staff said currently about
20 people suspected of having CCHF are under observation at Ankara Numune
Hospital.

Meanwhile, another person in the central Anatolian province of Yozgat died
of CCHF. After being bitten by a tick, a resident of the village of
Karakaya had 1st been seen at the city hospital and then was transferred to
Erciyes University Medical Faculty Hospital. The death toll from CCHF in
Yozgat is now 3 following the death of this patient. This year [2008], 500
people in the province [have sought treatment] at area hospitals with
complaints of tick bites. More than 20 people from throughout central
Anatolia have died this year from CCHF.

In addition, a woman from Bursa reportedly has CCHF. The 45 year old woman
was working in the field when she was bitten by a tick. She did not seek
treatment for the bite because the tick was not stuck to her skin. After
being hospitalized with vaginal bleeding twice following the bite, she was
placed in intensive care and diagnosed with CCHF.

Another woman, a resident of Manisa, sought treatment for a tick bite at a
hospital. The tick was removed by doctors from Kirkagac State Hospital.

Experts say people who have come into contact with a tick should be
monitored for 10 days following contact and seek professional medical care
if symptoms of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea present
themselves. Treatment for CCHF is primarily symptomatic and supportive, as
there is no established course of treatment.

[The risk of contracting CCHF in the central Anatolia region of Turkey
remains undiminished despite the increasing awareness of the problem. A map
of the provinces of Turkey is available at
<http://www.mapsofworld.com/turkey/turkey-political-map.html>. Kirkaga and
Yozgat are adjacent provinces in the centre of Turkey. Bursa is in the west.

Unfortunately, hospital-acquired infections are not unknown [see, for
example, Mardani M, Rahnavardi M, Rajaeinejad M, Naini KH, Chinikar S,
Pourmalek F, et al. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever among health care
workers in Iran: a seroprevalence study in two endemic regions. Am J Trop
