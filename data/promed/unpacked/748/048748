All 5 confirmed outbreaks -- Oene (2), Olst, Welsum, Nijbroek -- are
situated very close together (within 5 km). There are additional suspects
(in-contact) farms -- for example, a veal farm in Sprang-Capelle. [In 3
farms around Overberg (30 km east of Utrecht) [animals appear to have been
destroyed unnecessarily. The ministry thought erroneously that the farms
had received calves from France.
Emergency vaccination [was carried out today around Oene on 32 farms with
a total of 2000 animals (they will be killed later when there is enough
destruction capacity). The area where animals will be killed around Oene
has been extended to 2 km; a total of 27 000 animals [are destined for
slaughter so far. Farmers and civilians are protesting against mass
destruction of animals, blocking roads and lighting fires. They want to use
vaccination to protect the animals.

[It is reasonable for the people to want to vaccinate and protect the
animals. However, it seems they do not know [that vaccinated animals will
later be killed. Â­ Mod.TG
