The mass vaccination of cattle implemented in south-eastern Europe successfully contained the outbreaks of lumpy skin disease in the region in 2015-16. This is the main conclusion of an epidemiological analysis carried out by EFSA in cooperation with countries affected by the disease and those at risk.

This report follows EFSA's scientific advice published in August 2016, recommending vaccination to minimise the number of lumpy skin disease outbreaks in regions already affected or at risk.

"Despite the difficult epidemiological situation, all countries involved in the data collection have shown a high level of commitment and cooperation," said Alessandro Broglia, veterinarian at EFSA.

Closeness to affected farms and warm temperatures resulting in a higher presence of the insects that transmit the disease are among the factors responsible for the spread of the disease.

Recommendations
---------------
Experts made recommendations on how to improve data collection and analysis. They also recommended laboratory confirmation of suspected cases in vaccinated animals to differentiate the strains.

[Background information]
------------------------
Lumpy skin disease is an infectious disease of cattle, which causes economic losses and occasionally is fatal. It is characterised by skin nodules.

It was previously limited to southern and eastern Africa. After it was confirmed in Turkey in 2013, the virus spread through south-eastern Europe. As of 2016 the disease was detected in seven European countries -- Greece, Bulgaria, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo.

To produce this report EFSA experts worked with competent authorities of Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Turkey, Romania, Croatia, and Kosovo. Further scientific advice will be provided at the beginning of 2018.

Lumpy skin disease: I. Data collection and analysis; European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).EFSA Journal 2017; 15(4): Scientific report (approved: 27 Mar 2017; doi: 10.2903/j.efsa.2017.4773).

Abstract
--------
"An epidemiological analysis of the temporal and spatial patterns of LSD epidemics and of the risk factors for LSD spread in south-eastern Europe was performed, based on the data collected from affected and at risk countries. Since 2015, the extent of the LSD epidemics in south-eastern Europe was over 7600 LSD outbreaks with 12 800 affected animals, with most outbreaks occurring between May and August. Most LSD spread occurs over a relatively small distance, approximately between 10 and 20 km [6.2-12.4 mi], and the speed of propagation was estimated to be mostly up 2 km [1.2 mi]/day, in agreement with the vector-borne pattern of LSD. Proximity to affected farms, warm temperatures and related vector abundance were among the main risk factors for LSD spread. Within a few months, at least 90 percent of the animal population had been vaccinated with live homologous vaccine against LSD in south-eastern Europe. Where almost total vaccination coverage was achieved, no further outbreaks were reported. The vaccination effectiveness in Albania was estimated to be around 70 percent at farm level and 77 percent at animal level. Possible adverse effects to live homologous vaccine, including fever, decreased milk production and oedema at injection site were reported in Croatia (an LSD-free country) mostly within 2 weeks after vaccination, in 0.09 percent of the vaccinated animals. Unique farm identiﬁers should be always used across all databases, so to allow further analysis especially on improving the mathematical models for more robust estimates of transmission parameters applicable to the region, and for better estimation of vaccination effectiveness. All suspected clinical cases in vaccinated animals should be conﬁrmed by differentiating ﬁeld virus from vaccine strain. Trapping surveys for estimation of vector abundance can be carried out by targeting some sentinel farms, to be followed up during the whole LSD season, while long-term studies can give more accurate information about species composition and seasonality of potential LSD vectors.

ProMED-mail's interested subscribers are encouraged to read the full document at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2903/j.efsa.2017.4773/epdf. On page 10, please see a map showing all recorded LSD outbreaks notiﬁed in Europe in 2014-2016; on page 11, a "Summary table on LSD outbreaks and vaccination until 31 December 2016", providing data from 10 European countries (including Russia and Turkey) where LSD vaccination has been applied. In 9 of them, the disease was present; Croatia, where vaccination was applied, has remained, so far, free of the disease.

The terminology used in the document above, in relation to the vaccine applied in Europe, is "live homologous vaccine"; this means that the capripoxvirus in the vaccine is an attenuated virus derived initially from LSD-infected cattle, and not a capripoxvirus from other species (such as sheep or goats; hence "heterologous vaccine"). This aspect was clarified in detail in a previous EU scientific report (see 20160812.4410864), as follows:

"Only live attenuated vaccines against LSD are currently commercially available, such as the attenuated Neethling strain (LSDV) vaccine. General requirements for LSDV vaccines are described in the European Pharmacopoeia and in the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines (OIE, 2014). It is widely agreed that vaccination using a homologous vaccine is the only effective way to control the spread of LSDV in endemic countries. In some contexts, the sheep pox/goat pox vaccine was used for cattle but cross-protection is poor. Neutralising antibodies to LSDV persist for at least 2-3 years after vaccination. Antibodies appear 10 days after vaccination and reach the highest level 30 days post inoculation. Calves born to immunised cows will have passive immunity that persists for about 6 months."

In this respect, subscribers' attention is drawn to the following comment in the current document:

"Concerning the surveillance and any possible new LSD cases in 2017, given the current situation where most animals have been vaccinated with live LSDV homologous strain without DIVA possibilities, the most feasible option for surveillance seems to be the immediate notiﬁcation of clinical suspected cases, the conﬁrmation of LSDV in those animals by laboratory testing including the differentiation of ﬁeld virus from vaccine strain. Concerning adverse effects of vaccination, these should be collected systematically, where possible, at animal level". The differentiation between the Smithburn vaccine strain and a field LSD virus strain is addressed in ref 1 below.

According to earlier information, an inactivated LSD vaccine was under testing (see 20150929.3676992). An update will be helpful.
