Authorities of the Ministry of Health on Friday [21 Aug 2015] confirmed that there is an outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in Darien province.

The Director General of Health, Itza Barahona, stated in a press conference that there are 2 confirmed cases, one a child of 6 months who is under observation, and one other person who died.

"Of the 8 cases, 6 are less than 15 years old and live in El Real; the other 2 are from Rio Congo," she indicated.

Barahona states that although mortality is low in humans [low incidence], one must take preventive measures such as eliminating mosquito breeding sites, using repellants, wearing clothing that covers most of the body, and keeping areas clean. She stated that they will be carrying out fumigation days in order to avoid more cases.

An unofficial source of information indicated that 2 horses were [EEE] positive, after laboratory tests were done.

Eastern equine encephalitis is an infectious disease produced by an arbovirus of that name in the Togaviridae family, which was [1st] isolated in 1933. The virus is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected mosquitoes. The virus has a wide geographic distribution in the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Central and northern South America.

[The same information contained in the report above was also published on 21 Aug 2015 in another report (http://elsiglo.com/panama/encefalitis-equina-afecta-menor-6-meses/23886878 in Spanish).

There have been occasional cases of EEE in equine animals and humans in Darien province of Panama in the recent past. There were laboratory confirmed equine cases in 2013 and again in 2011. In 2010, there were also 25 suspected human EEE cases, although ProMED never received information that these cases were laboratory confirmed. Although relatively rare, clinical cases of encephalitis from EEE virus infections in humans and equine animals can be very serious, with a high case fatality rate and severe neurological sequelae in survivors. There is a commercially available vaccine for equine animals but not for humans.
