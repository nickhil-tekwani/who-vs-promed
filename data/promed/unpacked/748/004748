Final tests in Britain and Greece showed a turkey suspected of bird flu did
not carry the disease, the semi-official Athens News Agency said on
Saturday [29 Oct 2005].
The agency said the Agriculture Ministry announced that as a result, all
poultry trade restrictions on the islands of Chios and Oinousses, where the
suspected case appeared, were now lifted.
"It is self-evident, that, if and when similar cases appear in the future,
the exact same measures will be taken," the agency quoted the Ministry as
saying.
Greece had banned the export of all live birds and their products from the
area of Chios earlier in the month, when preliminary tests had showed the
turkey on the islet of Oinousses was positive for the H5 avian flu strain.
News of the suspected case caused concern among the public, which reduced
poultry consumption dramatically.
Greece is on the path of migratory birds making their way to warmer
southern climates this time of year. Neighbouring Turkey and Romania, which
have confirmed bird flu cases, have culled thousands of poultry in recent
weeks.

[The suspicion of HPAI in Greece dates back to 17 Oct 2005; see
20051017.3034, 20051021.3075. Some clarifications on the testing procedures
and their respective results, in both laboratories, might be helpful.
The results of tests being conducted on dead wild birds (reportedly wild
geese) found in Germany on 25 Oct 2005 are pending. - Mod.AS]

2 chickens in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq have been found to have a
strain of avian flu but experts said it was not the deadly H5N1 strain, a
regional government official said on Saturday [29 Oct 2005].
Azad Ezzidin, agriculture minister for the Kurdistan region, said 2
suspected cases had been investigated and the dead birds sent to Cairo for
tests by the World Health Organisation.
"They officially said that it was not the deadly strain," Ezzidin said.
Migrating wildfowl can carry the virus and they are believed to be the main
cause of H5N1's spread across Asia and into Europe, although this has not
yet been proven.
Iraq said on Thursday [27 Oct 2005] it was banning imports of poultry and
poultry products from 20 countries as bird flu fears rise after cases were
confirmed in neighbouring Turkey.
