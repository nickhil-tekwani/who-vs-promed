[Since the start of the BTV-4 event in Greece, reportedly on 29 May 2014, a total of 205 (submitted) outbreaks have been reported by the OIE, all in the Peloponnese region. The disease affects, in line with past experience, mainly sheep (a total of 1033 cases). There were also 8 cases in goats (recorded only in mixed sheep/goats flocks) and 9 in cattle (did they show clinical signs? which breeds/ages?).

OIE Outbreak summary, as of 25 Jul 2014:
Total outbreaks: 205 (submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 25 456 / 1033 / 228 / 0 / 0
Goats / 5909 / 8 / 1 / 0 / 0
Cattle / 752 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0
The said and additional data are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000015626_20140725_143544.pdf.

When addressing the cases reported in sheep, as presented in the 5 follow-up reports submitted so far to the OIE, there seems to be a trend of increased morbidity and case fatality rates, as follows (rates are apparent, expressed in percentages):

Report no & date / no outbreaks / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate
1. 18 Jun 2014 / 22 / 4.00 / 0.55 / 13.77
2. 1 Jul 2014 / 15 / 2.28 / 0.40 / 17.65
3. 15 Jul 2014 / 32 / 4.29 / 0.53 / 12.31
4. 16 Jul 2014 / 55 / 2.92 / 0.58 / 19.90
5. 25 Jul 2014 / 80 / 5.16 / 1.44 / 28.02

It will be interesting to check if this trend (in case statistically significant), is related to increased activity/density of the culicoid vector population, to a change in the pathogenicity of the causative agent, or to other factors. In any event, the vaccination prohibition policy deserves a discussion. For background and additional information, including the vector and the vaccination issues, subscribers are referred to the presentation "Recent Bluetongue Emergence in Peloponnisos (Greece) (June - early July 2014)", with maps and graphics, available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/docs/2014070304_bt_greece.pdf. - Mod.AS
