[In response to posts on West Nile virus in Idaho and possible mosquito
transmission involving alligators]
--------------------------------------------
The outbreak of West Nile virus in Idaho (SA) and references to alligators
has generated quite a few interesting posts and references to a
considerable number of sites on the web reporting the idea that mosquitoes
might have transmitted the virus from alligators to humans. Personally I do
not think the exact route of transmission in this case will be proven
unless further field data become available.
However, I imagine quite a few will be surprised that mosquitoes actually
feed on poikilotherms, but many mosquitoes in the genera _Uranotaenia_,
Mimomyia_, and _Deinocerites_ commonly feed on such animals, and a few
mosquito species feed on fish such as mud skippers. But some species in
more familiar genera such as _Aedes_, _Ochlerotatus_, and _Culex_ have been
reported as blood-feeding on reptiles. For example, in North America
_Ochlerotatus canadensis_ (occurs in Idaho) and _Ochlerotatus atlanticus_
have been found to feed on turtles, and W.S. Irby and C.S. Apperson (1)
reported that in the coastal plains of southern North Carolina, 3 _Aedes_
species and 4 _Culex_ species were found to feed on reptiles and/or amphibia.
Usually mosquito species that feed predominantly on birds are more likely
to feed on reptiles than those feeding primarily on mammals -- not
altogether surprising considering the evolution of birds.
Although mosquitoes have been reported as feeding on alligators (e.g., in
Florida), concentrating on soft tissues around the eyes and mouth, I have
not as yet discovered any published reports specifying the species involved.
