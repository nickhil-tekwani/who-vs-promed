UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, FISH - KENYA: (MARA RIVER)

The National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA), Public Health
Ministry, and Kenya Wildlife Service are investigating the deaths of
fish in Mara River.

Conservationists suspect the deaths that started last week [week of 7
Feb 2011] might have been caused by agro-chemicals from farms, which
drain into the river.

Hoteliers in Masai Mara Game Reserve are now expressing fear that the
chemicals might kill animals that depend on the river.

"The deaths could have been caused by agro-chemicals from large scale
farms on the upper side of the river. The chemicals might also kill
hippos, crocodiles, and other animals that drink water from the
river," said Ben Kipeno, a conservationist from the northern side of
the reserve.

Mr Kipeno said on Wednesday [16 Feb 2011] there were unconfirmed
reports that apart from fish, a crocodile and a hippo have already
succumbed to effects of the chemicals.

He urged the Government to rein in farmers along the river who use
potent chemicals and claimed that despite several complaints to NEMA
no action has been taken.

Officials from KWS [Kenya Wildlife Service] who were dispatched from
Nairobi took samples of the fish to the Government chemist for further
tests to ascertain the cause of the deaths. When The Standard visited
the river, dead fish were floating with scavengers, including the
Marabou stork, feeding on them.

The Narok South NEMA officer in charge Gabriel Tambushi said initial
reports had indicated that more than 5 million fish were killed at the
confluence of the seasonal Moyan River in Transmara with the Mara
following a heavy flood.

"The sudden change of weather that resulted in a heavy mist covering
the water surface, inhibiting fish and other animals that depend on
the river from breathing, might have been the cause of the deaths,"
said Tambushi. [Perhaps what this is trying to say, is that there was
less oxygen in the water. I have never known of a fog to cause fish to
die. - Mod.TG]

He did not rule out poisonous agro-chemicals from farms, which
depended on the Mara River for irrigation.

[A heavy flood can wash soil, sediment, and a variety of chemicals,
plant life, animal waste, etc. into a water drainage area, such as the
river. While agricultural chemicals may be involved it seems extremely
early to be making such comments.

Kenya had 2 issues of potential water poisoning last year (2010).
Some areas of Kenya have carbofuran, a very toxic pesticide, in use
and this could be a possible cause. However, flood waters are likely
to dilute most chemicals to the point that they would not cause a
problem.

However, if the river is used for drinking water, then this becomes a
separate issue from that of the dead fish.

Hopefully the samples collected will yield information about what has
happened to the fish. The article does not tell us if one type of fish
or various types of fish were affected. Neither does the article tell
us how many miles or kilometers of the river are affected. Information
such as this would be useful to the readers and to the investigators.
A flood washing chemicals into a river could cover an extensive area
vs. a small area and this article contains no information to give the
reader a picture of the extent of this situation.

A full necropsy of the fish, and appropriate testing should help us
understand what is happening here. However, unless the dead fish are
cleaned up, they will soon be a perfect medium for the growth of
bacteria that can produce botulism. Then when other animals, such as
birds consume the dead fish or the maggots infecting the dead fish,
then they will be poisoned by botulism and we will be hearing about a
host of dead birds in the same area.

We look forward to the results of the investigation and the findings
from the necropsy. - Mod.TG

The Mara River runs through the Masai Mara Game Reserve in south
western Kenya and the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and
eventually flows into Lake Victoria. It can be seen on the map at
