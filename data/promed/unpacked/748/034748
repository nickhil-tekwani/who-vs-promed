Commission adopts control measures to contain possible avian influenza
outbreak in Belgium
--------------------------------------------------
Following a possible outbreak of avian influenza in Belgium on 11 Mar 2003,
the Commission adopted a Decision today to reinforce the control measures
already put in place by the Belgian authorities. Avian influenza is a
highly contagious poultry disease that can cause severe economic damage to
the poultry industry.
Suspicion of an outbreak of avian influenza in the province of Antwerp,
close to the Dutch border, arose on 11 Mar 2003. The Belgian authorities,
in co-operation with the Commission services, immediately put in place
measures foreseen in Directive 92/40/EC. These measures include a
nation-wide standstill for the transport of live poultry and hatching eggs
and a prohibition on dispatching any live poultry or hatching eggs from the
whole territory of Belgium.
The Commission Decision adopted today reinforces these measures by defining
them at the EU level. The Commission Decision specifies that no live
poultry or hatching eggs may be dispatched from Belgium to other Member
States or third countries. They may also not be transported within Belgium.
The Decision is addressed to the Member States, and all Member States must
amend the measures they apply to trade so that they are in compliance with
this decision. In view of the specificity of poultry production, the
Belgian veterinary authority may authorise movements of day-old chicks and
poultry for immediate slaughter within Belgium as of 14 Mar 2003.
The measures contained in the Commission Decision are applicable until 20
Mar 2003 unless the suspicion has been officially ruled out by laboratory
testing. However, the situation will be reviewed at the meeting of the
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health scheduled for 13 Mar
2003. This meeting includes representatives of the Member States and the
Commission. The urgent measures adopted by the Commission could then be
updated to take into account the development of the situation.
The Commission will continue to work closely with the Belgian authorities
to ensure proper coordination within the EU.
