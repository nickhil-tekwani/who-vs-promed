As of Wed 31 Jan 2007, at least 27 persons with dengue fever, who
were admitted in January [2007] alone, remained confined at the Rizal
Medical Center in Pasig City.
Hospital records stated that the latest patient admitted Monday night
[29 Jan 2007] was from Fort Bonifacio in Taguig City, and whom
doctors diagnosed as suffering from Stage-2 dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF].
No casualties have been reported among the patients coming from the
cities of Taguig, Pasig and Makati, and the towns of Taytay and
Cainta in Rizal province.
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said he has ordered
his department to mobilize all available resources to tackle dengue
under an annual program. "Dengue is no longer a seasonal disease. It
is now spreading all year round. This has been the trend in our
neighboring countries," Duque said.
He said other tropical countries in the Southeast Asian region,
including Thailand and Vietnam, have recorded a rise in dengue cases
recently. Even Singapore, which he described as a clean city,
indicated a doubling of dengue cases in 2005 and 2006.
Duque said he has ordered the health department to prepare for a
12-month coverage against the disease, spread by mosquitoes that
breed in stagnant water.
"We have to adjust our campaign against dengue. I have ordered the
DOH to mobilize all resources to stop it," he said.

[The indications of year-around transmission of dengue virus in this
area are not good news. If this proves to be correct, local health
authorities will have to mount a vector control campaign throughout
the year. Public education will become critical to inform people of
the risks of water storage in and immediately around their residences
and places of business.

The Department of Health (DOH <http://www.doh.gov.ph/>) in Dumaguete
City reported a decrease in the number of dengue cases recorded in
Negros Oriental in 2006. Data collected by the DOH shows that dengue
cases in the province dipped to 978 last year [2006] from 1203 cases
recorded in 2005.
The mosquito-borne disease, however, left a more deadly trail in 2006
with 8 deaths recorded compared to 6 victims who died in 2005.
According to Suzy Sayre, Provincial Mosquito-Borne Disease Program
Coordinator of DOH, the casualties in 2006 were from Bacong, Bais
City, Dumaguete City, La Libertad, Mabinay, and Tanjay City. Sayre
said the areas most affected by the killer disease are mostly urban
areas such as the cities of Tanjay, Bais, and Dumaguete. "Dengue is
known as an urban disease," said Sayre.
The DOH surveillance team is now monitoring dengue cases as of
January 2007. Sayre said she is unable to divulge just yet the exact
number of dengue cases for January 2007 as surveillance work is still
being done.
She said the DOH continues to conduct intervention measures such as
regular health information drive, environmental sanitation, and
container management in all areas and Rural Health Units in the province.
DOH National Epidemiology Center Director Dr. Eric Tayag has recently
assured that DOH is at the forefront of the dengue outbreak in
Lagusan and Agusan del Sur.
Local officials of San Pedro, Laguna, have earlier declared a dengue
outbreak in their municipality following the death of a person and
the hospitalization of some 20 persons. The DOH is seriously
monitoring the condition of the victims while the Laguna Health
Office is currently conducting fogging operations to contain the
proliferation of dengue-carrying mosquitoes.
A dengue outbreak has also been declared in Bayugan, Agusan del Sur,
where 3 persons died and 18 persons were hospitalized. DOH said that
the numbers of dengue victims in Bayugan continues to rise but
assures the public that the DOH remains at the forefront in making
sure that all the victims receive immediate medical attention.

[ProMED thanks Joseph Dudley for submitting the same report. In a
previous post concerning dengue in the Philippines (PRO/EDR>
Dengue/DHF Update 2007 (04) 20070127.0364), ProMED requested
information about the "bandillo system" that was activated for local
dengue control. A-Lan Banks provided the following explanation, "From
what I can gather, a "bandillo" is a word in Cuyunon that means 'town
crier.'" Apparently, the role is usually taken by a policeman who
relays the information. I guess that makes sense in the context of
the dengue outbreak." - Mod.TY]

The mosquito-born-disease, dengue fever, has become prevalent in
urban dwellings these past few years not only in the Philippines but
also in the whole Asian region.
Dengue cases have reached alarming highs this January [2007] and the
Government will exhaust all means to combat the disease and contain
the outbreak. Because of this, the Department of Health (DOH) is
embarking on an intensified battle to fight the alarming increase of
dengue cases.
In San Lazaro Hospital alone, 189 dengue cases have so far been
listed. Other areas with dengue cases are Marikina, Rizal, Pasig,
Laguna, Agusan del Sur, Cagayan de Oro, Osamis, and Bukidnon.
Central Visayas recorded its highest number in 2005, with 3306
reported cases. Cebu province reported the most number of cases --
2313 and 75 fatalities. Bohol recorded 299 cases, 10 of which
resulted in death. Negros Oriental had 633 cases with 6 fatalities.
Siquijor has no exact figure, but DOH reported it has the lowest
recorded cases in the region.
Dr. Lakshmi Legaspi, assistant director of the Department of Health
7, said the months of June to August are considered the most
problematic, with persistent rains during these months providing
numerous breeding areas for the mosquito that carries the virus.
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque enjoins the public to maintain a clean
environment to avoid this disease. He asks the public to help the
health department contain the outbreak by means of a cleanup campaign
to destroy mosquito-breeding sites. Destroying of mosquito breeding
sites entails cleaning and removing containers that collect water;
burning, burying disposed containers, and covering water vats, drums,
and buckets.
Water containers should be washed out at least once a week. Per DOH,
it is appropriate to use insecticide or larvicide in ponds and
low-lying areas to kill mosquito larvae.

A total of 4862 dengue fever cases with 75 of them ending in the
patient's death have been recorded in January [2007] alone in
Indonesia, according to the Health Ministry report.
The cases occurred in 14 of the country's 33 provinces with the
special region of Jakarta registering the highest figure, Dr. Erna
Tresnaningsih, the head of the ministry's directorate of animal-borne
disease control, said.
Jakarta has the highest number of dengue fever patients, followed by
West Java, Central Java, and Lampung on Sumatera Island, she said,
and added that in December 2006, a total of 5400 dengue fever cases
were reported in 28 provinces leading to 77 deaths.
In January 2006 [2007? Mod. TY] the number of cases reached 18 941 in
33 provinces and led to 192 deaths, she said.
The health ministry had taken several measures to reduce the rate of
fatalities from the disease that always spreads before and after the
rainy season through the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. "The key to its
prevention is the environment and the people. If the environment is
free of pools of water which can be used by the mosquito to breed and
the people maintain environmental health, the disease is surely more
controllable," Tresnaningsih said as quoted by the Antara news agency
Tuesday [30 Jan 2007]. She admitted that efforts to control the
disease had not yielded the desired results because public
participation was still relatively low.
Meanwhile in West Java, a total of 42 people have died in the
outbreak of dengue fever in the province since early this month
{January 2007]. The province recorded 1889 confirmed cases of dengue
fever between 1 and 29 Jan [2007], said Dr. Yudhi Prayudha, Head of
the Provincial Health Office, adding that the number of deaths rose
sharply from only 27 in the same period last year [1-29 Jan 2006]
mostly because the patients sought medical treatment only at a very late stage.

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness
with rash (although some infants and very young children may develop
shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and
die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
