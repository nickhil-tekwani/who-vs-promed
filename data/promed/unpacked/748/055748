Notes:

Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.

1. Due to differences in the case definitions being used at a national
level, probable cases are reported by all countries except the United
States of America, which is reporting suspected cases under investigation.

2. Includes cases who are "discharged" or "recovered" as reported by the
national public health authorities.

3. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of (See Affected Areas ).

4. One death attributed to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
occurred in a case medically transferred from Viet Nam.

[B] The list of affected areas can be found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsareas/2003_04_16/en/>
and is unchanged from prior report

[C] The epidemic curves can be found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsepicurve/epiindex/en/>
and are current as of 14 Apr 2003.

[D] There is an interesting discussion on the collaborating networks
developed as part of the operational response to SARS that can be found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/goarn2003_4_16/en/>

[E] From a press release/conference 16 Apr 2003 found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/2003_04_16/en/>

2 of the questions that were posed related to the completeness in reporting
of cases from Beijing (and the lack of reporting of cases from the military
hospitals), and the lay press observations of a change in profile of deaths
in Hong Kong, where recently there have been deaths in individuals not
older than 60 with chronic diseases, but rather a younger/healthier group
of people.

Dr. Heymann responded to these questions: ...on the age issue, it's always
useful to understand that this disease starts out in health workers in most
cases, so the first patient infects health workers and they are all of a
certain age; they are not young people, they are middle-aged people or in
their 20s to 40s or 50s, so it's natural that that would be the age that's
first infected. Then as it spreads out from those workers into other
populations, the ages change, so it's very important to understand the
dynamics of this disease.

As far as Beijing goes, last evening they visited the military hospital.
They estimated that there are at least 50 patients in this hospital with
SARS from what they've seen. They also estimate that there are between
100-200 probable cases in Beijing, more than has been reported, and they
feel that there might even be up to 1000 people who are under observation
right now at various stages of infection; some probably are not SARS, in
fact many are probably not SARS, but they are taking precautions in
observing these. It's our impression that China needs to get clear on how
it reports these diseases and they are working very closely with the
Chinese to get better reporting. It's also the team's feeling that Beijing
has many resources that they can put to work on this disease and that SARS
will not be a problem in Beijing if they get these resources working. Their
concern is in the provinces, especially in the western provinces, and they
are afraid that it will not only spread from cities into the communities
but into areas where there may not be health facilities that are very
closely accessible to people. So, the challenge now is for China to not
only report, but to trace infection, to do infection control in the
hospitals, and do everything that the other countries are doing to stop the
spread of this disease.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 16 Apr 2003

The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:

As of 3 PM 16 Apr 2003, there are an additional 36 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 7 healthcare workers (6 from Princess Margaret Hospital and
one from Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital). The remaining 29 were
other patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.

A total of 257 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 14 were discharged
today. 122 patients are receiving treatment in intensive care unit.

5 patients died in hospitals, bringing to 61 the total number of deaths
relating to atypical pneumonia. A 54-year-old female and a 73-year-old
male, both with a history of chronic disease, died in Queen Elizabeth
Hospital. A 44-year-old male and a 62-year-old female died in Princess
Margaret Hospital. Another chronically ill male patient, aged 73, died in
Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital.

The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:

Cumulative no. cases/ no. recovered/ no. deaths
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 298/ 100/ 61
Patients, family members & visitors: 970/ 157/ 0
Total: 1268/ 257 /61

* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late
stage of infection.

SARS Situation Update 16 Apr 2003

As of 16 Apr 2003, 6 additional SARS patients have been discharged,
bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from SARS to 91.
61 SARS patients remain hospitalised.

There are 5 additional SARS cases reported today. They comprise 2 staff
members of National Cancer Centre (NCC), namely a radiographer who had been
admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) since 9 Apr 2003 for observation,
and a porter who was admitted to TTSH on 14 Apr 2003. Both patients
developed lung changes on chest X-ray yesterday and hence were diagnosed to
have SARS. The third SARS case is an inpatient at Singapore General
Hospital (SGH) Ward 58 who has been observed in TTSH since 13 Apr 2003, and
who developed lung changes yesterday. The other 2 cases comprise the son of
a SARS patient, and a doctor at National University Hospital (NUH) who
looked after 2 patients prior to their diagnosis of SARS.

Situation Update at NCC
There are 2 NCC staff members who have been diagnosed as probable SARS.

The radiographer developed a fever (37.8 deg C) on Saturday 5 Apr 2003. He
did not see a doctor. He was well with no fever over the next 3 days (6--8
Apr 2003). He worked in the radiology department of NCC on 7 and 8 Apr
2003. Twice-daily temperature monitoring was performed and he was noted to
have no fever. During these 2 days, he performed CT scans and MRI on a
total of 11 patients.

In the early hours of 9 Apr 2003, he developed fever of 38.4 deg C. He went
to Changi General Hospital (CGH) and was transferred to TTSH on the same
day. On admission he was classified as a low-risk suspect for SARS. CGH
observed all the infection control measures when the patient was there.

Another hospital staff (porter), who handles dispatch work, developed a
low-grade fever (37.5 deg C) on the morning of Thu 10 Apr 2003. He was not
assigned any duties and during that time he only came into contact with the
departmental staff. At noon, his temperature went up to 38.6 deg C. He was
seen at the SGH Staff Clinic and was given 2 days MC [medical leave?] and
asked to return for a review on 12 Apr 2003.

He had no fever on 11 Apr 2003. He did not return to the Staff Clinic on 12
Apr 2003 and instead saw his neighbourhood General Practitioner (GP). He
was given 2 more days MC. He continued to have low-grade [fever]. On 14 Apr
2003, he went directly to the Staff Clinic and was referred to TTSH and
admitted on the same day.

Besides these 2 staff members, the other NCC staff are currently well. As a
precaution, NCC has closed its radiology department until 20 Apr 2003.
Urgent radiological x-rays will be done at SGH A&E Dept. Non-urgent
appointments will be deferred. NCC has contacted 10 of the 11 patients who
had X-ray investigations done by the radiographer and they are well.
Although the radiographer did not go into the waiting room of the X-ray
department, as a precaution, NCC has been contacting the 200 patients who
have had other X-rays done during the period 7--9 Apr 2003. Investigations
are still in progress to trace the source of infection.

Situation Update at NUH
The doctor attended to a patient who was being treated for heart failure.
The patient, who was admitted to NUH on 8 Apr 2003, had been a visitor at
SGH Ward 57 in end March. He had multiple medical conditions and did not
have fever at that time. When he was reviewed in the ward, the possibility
of concurrent pneumonia was recognised as his condition had deteriorated.
The patient was unstable and required transfer to the NUH Intensive Care
Unit where he was intubated. The transfer to TTSH took place later on the
same day when the patient's condition stabilised. The patient passed away
on 12 Apr 2003.

The NUH doctor developed fever on 11 Apr 2003 evening and was sent to TTSH
Emergency Department on the same day. She has been diagnosed as a probable
SARS case on 16 Apr 2003.

Home Quarantine for non-SARS patients with chronic conditions discharged
from SGH and TTSH
Contact tracing at SGH has identified the patients and healthcare workers
who may have been exposed to SARS. These contacts have been quarantined or
are being monitored. There are about 800 inpatients at present in SGH who
have not been exposed. However, as a precaution, patients discharged from
SGH from 17 Apr 2003 onwards who have chronic co-morbid conditions will be
issued Home Quarantine Orders (HQO) for 10 days. At end of 10 days, SGH
will recall them for review, following which they will be on phone
surveillance for a further 10 days. The other discharged patients who do
not have any chronic conditions will not be on HQO but phone surveillance
for 21 days. The same arrangement will be implemented for non-SARS patients
with chronic conditions discharged from TTSH.

Summary of SARS cases
There was a SARS patient in intensive care who died late 15 Apr 2003. She
was the mother of a doctor who contracted SARS while looking after a SARS
patient. The other deceased is the mother of a SARS patient. On 13 Apr
2003, we reported 2 SARS deaths linked to the SGH cluster comprising an
inpatient and the brother of an index patient. The preliminary findings of
both patients were that they died of other medical conditions unrelated to
SARS. We are awaiting results of further investigations.

Below is the summary of the SARS cases to date:

Number Discharged: 85 plus 6
Hospitalised: 61 (including 16 in intensive care)
Deaths: 13 + 2 (pending post mortem findings)

Total: 167

Suspected: 91 (including 8 children below 18)
Under home quarantine orders: 582

Update 32: Severe acute respiratory syndrome -- 16 Apr 2003 4:30 PM

As of 16 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 303 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 13 deaths in Canada. To date, transmission has been limited to
specific transmission settings such as households, hospitals, and specific
community settings. The information contained in this update is based on
the information available to Health Canada at this time.

The details of the cases to date are as follows:

Ontario is reporting 122 probable and 127 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 4 probable and 38 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.

So far, 91 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These
people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.

These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST 16 Apr 2003.

[These data do not mention the newswire reports of transmission within a
religious community related to attendance at a funeral of a probable SARS
case. The newswire reports have been varied, with some mentioning that
most of the cases had been previously reported, but according to this
update there is no mention of community-based close contact, which appeared
to be the mode of transmission in this generation of cases. More
information on this observation from official sources would be appreciated.

[As of today's update there is a cumulative total of 3293 cases of SARS
reported to the WHO, with 58 new cases reported in the preceding 24 hours;
a total of 159 deaths (case fatality rate of 4.8 percent) and 1548 patients
have recovered (47 percent). In the past 24 hours, Hong Kong has reported
36 new cases and 5 deaths; in China there have been 14 new cases
reported. Based on the information provided by Dr. Heymann in today's WHO
press briefing, we expect to see the numbers of cases reported from Beijing
to increase significantly once official reports from the military hospitals
are received. In addition, there has been the suggestion of increased
transmission outside of Beijing and Guangdong. It would be interesting to
see a breakdown of reported cases by province to determine whether new
areas of local transmission have been identified. For example, the lay
press has reported cases in Inner Mongolia, suggesting local transmission,
but this area has not officially been added to the affected areas list --
see ProMED-mail posting SARS - worldwide (45): cases 20030412.0890.

There are now 199 suspected cases from 32 states in the United States. This
represents an increase of 6 cases from the last report on 15 Apr
2003. There has been mention in press releases (CDC press release 14 Apr
2003 (accessible at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030414.htm> and in many lay
press reports) that the USA plans to change reporting practices, separating
suspected and probable cases using the WHO definitions. When that occurs,
we expect to see a marked decrease in the numbers of cases of SARS reported
on a daily basis to WHO. - Mod.MPP]
