Tomato leaf curl geminivirus in Australia: occurrence, detection,
sequence diversity and host range
J Stonor, CSIRO Plant Industry, Adelaide Laboratory, PO Box 350, Glen
Osmond, South Australia 5064; P Hart, CSIRO Entomology, Black
Mountain Laboratory, PO Box 1700, Canberra, Australian Capital
Territory 2601; M Gunther, Department of Primary Industries
Queensland, PO Box 652, Cairns, Queensland 4870; P DeBarro (CSIRO
Entomology, 120 Meiers Road, Indooroopilly, Queensland 4068,
Australia; and M A Rezaian <ali.Rezaian@csiro.au> (as for Stonor).
The occurrence of whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses in Australia was
studied using a mixed DNA probe capable of detecting a range of
distinct geminiviruses. The only geminivirus species detected was
Tomato leaf curl begomovirus (TLCV), which is spread across a vast
geographical region of far-northern coastal Australia, an area
inhabited by the Australasian-Oceania biotype of _Bemisia tabaci_.
The newly introduced silverleaf whitefly, _B. tabaci_ biotype B,
forms high population densities in the eastern coastal region of
Queensland and is currently located approximately 150 km from the
nearest known TLCV-infected area.
The viral host range appeared to be narrow, and of 58 species of crop
plants and weeds inoculated using the B biotype, only 11 became
infected with the virus, including 5 that did not show foliar
symptoms.
A DNA fragment of 694 nt, including the complete C4 open reading
frame (ORF), the overlapping N-terminal part of the C1 ORF, and the
viral iterons involved in replication, was amplified from 11 TLCV
field isolates and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed an overall
sequence variation of up to 14 percent in this region, as well as the
presence of distinct viral iterons (repeats).

[TLCV-Au was first reported in 1971 on tomato. As of 2001, it was
known to occur in NT and WA, where it causes tomato leaf roll
disease. It has been found in the Kimberly area of WA from Kununurra
across coastal NT to Booroloola in the Gulf area of NT. It has also
been detected in Kowanyama, Normanton, and Karumba in the
southwestern Cape York Peninsula area of Queensland but not south of
there. Infected plants are severely stunted, leaflets are smaller
than normal, and fruits are drastically reduced in size and basically
unmarketable. The virus is common in weedy hosts including apple of
Peru (_Nicandra physalodes_) and Jimson weed (_Datura stramonium_)
Do any of our Australian colleagues have more information on the
distribution of this virus in the country? Please let me know.
