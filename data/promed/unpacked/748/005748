Outbreaks of bird flu detected in the past 2 weeks in Germany, the Netherlands and Britain could be linked and may have been spread by migrating wild birds, the head of the World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) said on Monday [17 Nov 2014].

All 3 countries have reported cases of highly pathogenic bird flu, which poses a risk to birds but not human health. The Netherlands detected the outbreak over the weekend and Germany earlier this month [October 2014].

Both said it was the H5N8 strain, which has never been detected in humans but led to the culling of millions of farm birds in Asia, mainly South Korea, earlier this year [2014]. Dutch authorities decided to cull 150 000 chickens at the affected farm.

It was still unclear whether the cases found at a duck farm in England were the same strain. Britain's chief veterinary officer said it was an H5 virus but not H5N1, which has killed hundreds of people [In an immediate notification to the OIE, the UK reported that it has been found to be a highly pathogenic H5 strain. - Mod.AS].

When asked whether the outbreaks were linked, OIE Director General Bernard Vallat said: "Theoretically, it's possible. We will know this; through the genetic characteristics, we can know the ties between the virus, but it takes a bit of time."

As migratory birds could spread the virus over huge distances, he added: "It could appear anywhere at any time. Every time Europe has been contaminated to date, it has been through migrating birds. It is hard to protect farms from wild birds. They are often attracted by food and other birds," Vallat told Reuters in an interview. "If feed is not protected and a wild bird comes to eat it, it's enough to contaminate the feed and then those that eat that feed."

An OIE official added later that the European outbreaks could be linked to the Asian ones.

Vallat said correct inspection procedures could stem the outbreaks. "An early detection including veterinarians can avoid a spread of the disease in farms. It is the secret."

The Netherlands, the world's leading egg exporter, imposed a 72-hour ban on transportation of poultry products, a precautionary measure that Vallat said was extremely strict. "The Germans were right not to do the same," he said.

[According to the Dutch press, citing Gert-Jan Oplaat, chairman of the Dutch Poultry Farmers' Union, the damage caused by the outbreak of bird flu in Hekendorp can reach up to 100 million Euros [USD 125 million]. He said that the whole poultry industry is at standstill since the publication of the transport ban on Sunday [16 Nov 2014] afternoon.

Each day, 2 to 2.5 million chicks are born which now cannot be transported to the rearing farms. "All slaughterhouses and poultry processing plants are still. That means that 8000 employees of the poultry slaughterhouses are inactivated," he said. According to him, the damage to the sector by Monday [17 Nov 2014] has already been 10 to 20 million Euros [USD 12.5-25 million]. He also fears bankruptcies if the European Commission closes the borders for longer than a few days. (See, in Dutch, at http://tinyurl.com/kr2krqw). - Mod.AS]

UK experts said that while the virus is deadly in poultry, the risks to humans are relatively small.

Professor Wendy Barclay, a leading virologist of Imperial College London, said the strain is unlikely to be harmful to humans except for farmers in direct contact infected animals.

Prof Barclay said: "Avian flu viruses have been seen in poultry in mainland Europe; the one in Yorkshire is likely to be the same as that seen in Germany and the Netherlands. It's good at infecting poultry -- including chickens, turkeys and geese -- because it's highly pathogenic. It kills very quickly. An infected bird will not develop symptoms over a period of time. It will just drop dead, often without warning." She added: "Meat can't carry it. Viruses are inert unless inside a living host."

[Dr Vallat's and Prof Barclay's views that the UK virus strain is/may be similar to the German and Dutch HPAI H5N8 strain are plausible; at this point, the full serotyping of the H5 HPAI virus strain on the East Yorkshire duck farm is still pending/not published; final results and genotyping are expected soon.

According to The Telegraph (17 Nov 2014), the affected farm is run by a company which has 2.8 billion ducks in China and farms in Germany (full text at http://tinyurl.com/nqjs8nr).

The following information on HPAI H5N8 in turkeys in Ireland (1983) may be of interest (thanks to Sabine Zentis for drawing attention to this event):

M.S. McNulty, G.M. Allan, R.M. McCracken & P.J. McParland (1985). Isolation of a highly pathogenic influenza virus from Turkeys, Avian Pathology, 14:1, 173-176, DOI: 10.1080/03079458508436216.

"SUMMARY
An influenza virus was isolated from turkeys with an acute disease causing 30 percent mortality. The virus was subtyped as H5N8. The nomenclature A/turkey/Ireland/83 (H5 N8) is proposed for this isolate. The virus had an ICPI of 1.80 to 1.85 for 1-day-old chicks and an IVPI of 2.74 for 6-week-old chickens. Following oronasal inoculation of juvenile and adult turkeys, chickens and ducks with the isolate, 100 percent mortality occurred in turkeys and chickens. No clinical signs were observed in inoculated ducks, but all developed serum antibody titres against the virus."

The authors stated that the source of virus in the outbreak was: "unknown. However, an influenza virus (H5N?) was isolated from a large duck-rearing enterprise very close to the infected turkey farm. As some of these ducks are kept outdoors for part of the year, one possibility is that they were originally infected by migrating feral waterfowl and that infection subsequently spread to the turkeys." - Mod.AS
