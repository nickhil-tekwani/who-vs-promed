Title: Virulent Newcastle disease virus found in double-crested cormorants

Since late July [2010], the USGS [US Geological Survey] National Wildlife
Health Center (NWHC) has confirmed that at least 800 double-crested
cormorants have died in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin from
virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV). Ring-billed gulls and American
white pelicans have also been found dead in these same areas, but vNDV has
not been confirmed as the cause of death. This virus sporadically cycles
through nestling and juvenile cormorants in summer nesting colonies. The
designation of vNDV indicates that this strain has the potential to cause
illness or mortality in poultry, although transmission of wild bird vNDV to
poultry is probably rare based on similar historic events. NWHC has alerted
wildlife management and agricultural authorities in affected states,
including the USDA. According to the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health
Centre, Newcastle disease has also been confirmed in cormorants in
Saskatchewan.

Newcastle Disease (NDV) is caused by infection with an RNA virus within the
avian paramyxovirus-1 (APMV-1) group. Not only is NDV highly contagious,
but also there is great variation in the severity of disease caused by
different strains of NDV. A classification system for the severity of
disease has been established to guide disease control efforts in poultry
because of the economic damage of NDV. Typically, wild bird isolates are
usually classified as non-virulent.

NDV had not been reported as a cause of mortality in free-living native
birds of the US or Canada prior to 1990. In 1992, multiple mortality events
occurred in double-crested cormorant colonies across the Great Lakes, upper
Midwest, and Canada with over 35 000 birds estimated dead. The most recent
large-scale outbreak in the US occurred in 2008 when over 1200
double-crested cormorants from Minnesota colonies died. The virus has seen
little genetic change over time and geographic location since 1990.

Clinical signs of NDV in wild birds have only been observed in sick
nestling or juvenile double-crested cormorants and include twisting of the
head and neck, paralysis of the legs and wings, lack of muscular
coordination, and tremors. The virus can be transmitted by direct contact,
feces, and excretions from infected birds. Segregation of potentially
infected cormorants and poultry is warranted to minimize the possible
introduction of NDV to poultry. Biosecurity, surveillance, and also
vaccination in the case of poultry, are all important in limiting the
spread of NDV. NDV is not a major concern for human health, although it may
cause a mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms.

Further investigations are in progress to assess the extent of the
outbreak. NWHC is working with officials from the Minnesota and Wisconsin
Departments of Natural Resources, biologists from affected wildlife
refuges, USDA APHIS Wildlife and Veterinary Services, USDA National
Veterinary Services Laboratories, the Minnesota, North Dakota, and
Wisconsin State Veterinarian's offices, and the Canadian Cooperative
Wildlife Health Centre to manage the outbreak by reducing possible impacts
to wild birds and preventing spread to domestic poultry.

If you see cormorants or other species displaying field signs described
above, or if you would like more information, please contact a member of
NWHC's Field Investigation Team listed below.
