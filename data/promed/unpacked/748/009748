[2] Defra's epidemiology report, update 21 Sep 2007
Date: Fri 21 Sep 2007
Source: DEFRA web-site, FMD 2007 EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORT [edited]
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/epireport240907.pdf>

Situation at 12:00 Friday 21 September 2007. Day 49: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. There have been 5 confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD)
in Surrey since early August 2007.
2. The main working hypothesis which has emerged from the ongoing
epidemiological investigations is that the 1st case (IP1) originated
from fomite transmission from the Pirbright site that is shared by a
research and diagnostic laboratory, and a commercial vaccine
production plant. The 2nd case (IP2) most likely derived from the 1st case.
3. A total of 3 further cases were confirmed 34 days, 36 days and 40
days respectively, after primary cleansing and disinfection of IP2;
that is, the last date on which live virus was known to be in the
environment of this farm. The location of these cases and their
temporal relationship are shown in Figures 1 and 2 [a map and a
timeline diagram, pages 16 and 17 of the document in the above URL. -
Mod.AS]. In the first 4 cases of disease only beef cattle were
affected; these were kept in small herds on holdings with animals
kept in more than one location. Two of these farms also kept pigs.
The 5th case was a mixed species small holding and FMD was found in
both the beef cattle and the sheep, but not in the pigs. These
holdings are typical of livestock keeping in the area.
4. The age of lesions on IP5 provides a temporal link between the
August [2007] phase of the outbreak and the cases discovered in
September [2007]. That is, IP5 became infected during the period in
August when live virus is known to have been in the environment, and
was itself infectious during the time period when the IPs 3 and 4
became infected.
5. Investigations into the source and method of spread for IP3, IP4
and IP5 are ongoing, including any possible links to IP1 and IP2.
Epidemiological evidence to date suggests IP5 was infected first and
most likely transmitted infection to IP4 -- IP3 may have been
infected by either IP4 or IP5.
6. The most likely explanation for infection of IP5 is fomite
transmission from one of the original sources of virus (the Pirbright
site, IP1 or IP2) while these were still infectious. Less likely but
possible explanations are wind-borne infection from IP1 or IP2 and
undisclosed FMD on a livestock premises in the area. A very remote
possibility is a wildlife vector [Most probably this refers to deer;
see commentary. - Mod.AS].
7. The epidemiological investigations indicate an unusual fomite
transmission over a distance of at least 16km [9.94 miles]. This
questions the accepted international control measures for local
spread which use a 3km [1.86 mile] Protection Zone and a 10km [6.2
mile] Surveillance Zone around each IP, that have been effective in
the past. In addition, in the September [2007] component of the
current outbreak, the number of IPs should have been more limited.
These additional IPs (IP3B, IP3C and IP4B) would have been prevented
by the early detection and notification of suspect FMD on IP5, but
clinical disease was not detected or reported.
8. The findings also suggest a need, in this case, to review the
extent and level of surveillance by animal keepers and more rigorous
structured surveillance by the veterinary authorities. This is being
done through a constant appraisal of the epidemiological assessments,
which form part of the medley of epidemiological studies in
operation, that seek to characterise the areas and farms at risk of infection.

The sender of this report comments that the epidemiological map on
page 16, updated 21 Sep 2007, shows 6 red triangles ("Infected
premises - disease confirmed") as well as 2 orange triangles
("infected premises - evidence of PCR). This means, that the total
number of IP's, on Fri, 21 Sep 2007, was 8; this deviates from the 5
IP's which were officially published. Since Friday, 2 additional IP's
have been officially added, bringing the official current total to 7
IP's while -- according to the map -- their number is 10. It is
possible that the background to this discrepancy is the criteria
applied by the authorities in defining an IP; clarification will help.
As to the (according to the above report, very remote) possibility
that deer could have been involved in the dissemination of the FMD
virus, subscribers are reminded that this issue was subject to a
study at Pirbright during the early 1970's. The study, which
included experimental infection trials, showed that infected red deer
can shed amounts of virus similar to cattle and sheep, and could thus
infect in-contact animals. It was also shown that fallow deer and
sika deer can become carriers. (Gibbs et al., 1975. Foot-and-mouth
disease in British deer: transmission of the virus to cattle, sheep
and deer. Vet. Rec., 96, 558-563). - Mod.AS].

FMD and bluetongue: update to integrated strategy
--------------------------------------------------
[The following animal movements restrictions, modified following the
discovery of a 3rd case of bluetongue in England, are related to the
"Map of Great Britain with Foot and Mouth Risk Areas and Bluetongue
Temporary Area," available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/map-zones250907.pdf>.
- Mod.AS]
1. FMD Surveillance Zone
------------------------
No movements of live animals
2. FMD Risk Area
----------------
The following livestock movements out of this area will be permitted:
- Direct moves to slaughter (both within and outside the risk area);
- Direct moves to slaughter via collection centres and dedicated
slaughter sales (both within and outside the risk area).
The following moves will be permitted within this area only, but no
FMD susceptible livestock may be moved out of this area into the low
risk area (except for slaughter as above):
- Calving cows (up to 50km [31 miles] with a 20 day standstill);
- Pigs moving within established "pyramids" between specific units
(up to 50km or 100km [31 - 62 miles]);
- Welfare moves of up to 3km [1.86 miles] within the same premises
may take place within this county.
3. FMD Low Risk Area
--------------------
- Direct moves to slaughter (both within and outside the risk area);
- Direct moves to slaughter via collection centres and dedicated

Temporary Control Area for purposes other than slaughter;
- Farm to farm movements of ruminants will be permitted under strict
conditions and subject to high levels of biosecurity within the area only.
Pig movements (within established pyramids only) will be permitted to
move within and out of the area to other areas, subject to licence conditions.
5. Norfolk / Suffolk Bluetongue Area
------------------------------------
Pig movements (within established pyramids only) will be permitted to

Farm to farm ruminant movements are prohibited.
Ruminants may not be moved out of this area into any other area, for
any purpose, other than for direct movements to slaughter in Essex.

Direct moves to slaughter may only take place in Norfolk and Suffolk
