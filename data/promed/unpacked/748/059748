A few words and thoughts about the provoking posting of Thu, 30 Jul. 1998
entitled "body piercing, tatooing
& infection".
"All John Doe wanted was a $45 removal of his appendix, but he ended up
with a $125,000 liver transplant." Would ProMED-mail print anything like
this? Most infectious organisms demand a site of entry and even the
slightest insight in microbial and infectious disease tells there is a rise
in the risk of infection when rupture of skin occurs.
Semmelweiss could have said: "dirty hands don't mingle with needles and
skin". Hygienic measures are long time ago acknowledged a major factor in
the prevention of infectious diseases. This also applies for tattooing
organisations and every tattoo artist belonging to a professional laud. A
potential tattoo customer might check out the reputation and skills of the
artist. He also might check the tattooing equipment, find out whether
needles are used twice etc.
ProMED-mail, or the moderators, should keep up the usually good work with
updated epidemic details, possible sources of transmission and world wide
news. Sensational stuff like statements of the "If anybody's thinking of
getting a tattoo, I'd say, 'Don't,'" kind should be reserved magazines and
newspapers I don't pay much attention. An epidemic spreading from a tattoo
shop is good stuff, distribute those stories and not ones describing a
juvenile of poor destiny choosing the tattoo of a wolf standing on a rock
howling at the moon because "it just stuck out", please. The art of tattoo
is an ancient rite of mankind, by far older than modern medicine and open
wound surgery. I assume that the latter causes, in magnitudes of order, far
more severe infections than tattoos.
PS. I assume there are a lot of tattoo parlors in Sherman, Texas. If there,
however, is only one, it would be a shame to indirectly reveal its
identification as long as cruise ships and hotels serving as transient
reservoirs for legionellosis are kept anonymous by ProMED-mail.

I would like to respond to Joe Shea's article on the topic of infection
risk in piercing and tattooing as seen in the American Reporter, Oklahoma
City.
While it is true that there is potential for disease transmission from any
event which breaks the skin, the manner in which it is accomplished is
highly relevant. It is vital to become an educated consumer of body art
services, to ask the right questions and be certain your health and safety
is assured.
A skilled and caring professional piercer uses appropriate precautions to
prevent exposure to disease-causing microorganisms during all procedures.
We adhere to established Universal Precautions Procedures, including the
wearing of disposable latex gloves for all client contact. Instruments are
sterilized in individual packets prior to use in a Pelton-Crane Steam
Autoclave which is spore-tested weekly. (Documentation is on file, and is
available by request).
Our piercing needles are, of course, single use. Along with our
biohazardous paper waste, they are picked up and appropriately disposed of
by BFI, our Biohazardous Waste Disposal company. (Documentation is on file,
and is available by request).
The marking pen used in the piercing procedure (even on unbroken or
non-mucous membrane skin) is single use. We work from a sterile field, and
use only products from single-use disposable packets. Supplies are
handled only with freshly gloved hands, and are wiped down at the beginning
of each day with MadaCide (liquid hospital disinfectant/cleaner) and Super
Sani-cloths (germicidal-impregnated wipes).
Workstations are completely wiped down at the beginning of the day, and
after each client with Super Sani-cloths and MadaCide.
Jewelry is individually packaged and autoclaved prior to use. Because the
jewelry packets are handled at the retail counter, once the contents are
opened onto the sterile field, gloves are changed.
The utmost care is taken with each client to assure an aseptic procedure.
We pierce many medical professionals who routinely comment that we are much
more stringently hygienic than the hospitals and medical offices in which
they work!
There is no more cause for concern of disease transmission to any client of
Rings of Desire as a result of piercing than there would be from donating
blood or plasma.
