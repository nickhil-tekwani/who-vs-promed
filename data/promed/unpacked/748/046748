Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) is actively looking for medical personnel who can assist us with the Ebola crisis in West Africa. We are looking for physicians and nurses who would be able to work in our health structures, and for water and sanitation experts with experience working in health facilities and with isolation wards and infection control.

Due to the risks associated with working in this outbreak we are looking for medical professionals that meet the criteria below:

- Professionals that have worked in an highly contagious ward with PPE (personal protective equipment) and know infection control and safety practices inside isolation areas while caring for patients.
- Those with experience working with viral haemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola, ...) are most needed
- Availability of 6-8 weeks for a field assignment
- Willingness to treat patients in West Africa

If you think you or anyone you know in your professional circles meet this criteria and are interested in working with MSF, please have them apply via our website. We will validate all individuals that apply and fast track those applications that meet the criteria above. Please ensure that you clearly detail your relevant experience in your application.

To apply: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/work-us/work-field/applying-msf.

If you have further inquiries about the requirements or our needs please email us at: <Field.HR@newyork.msf.org>.

Please note that we are responding to a high volume of emails at the moment and while we do our best to respond quickly, we may only be able to respond to the most urgent and relevant emails. If you are not from the US, you may need to apply to another office; contact details are available via the application weblink above.

For more information about our work in the Ebola outbreaks please see: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/medical-issues/ebola.

We look forward to your application. Thank you for your help.
