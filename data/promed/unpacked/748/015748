It was a lavish Dominican wedding with 500 guests, some flying in from
Madrid, Mexico and Boston. But now some guests are saying the lobster
at last Saturday's [22 Jan 2011] wedding at an exclusive resort gave
them cholera.

Dominican Health Minister Bautista Rojas said 37 of the guests have
tested positive for cholera and officials are trying to track down the
rest for testing. Rojas said the lobster was purchased in Pedernales,
a town that borders Haiti, which shares the island of Hispaniola with
the Dominican Republic.

Venezuelans returned from the wedding with cholera-like symptoms,
putting the country in a near panic. The country quickly quarantined
the ill, and tried to reassure its people that they had the situation
under control. "We have suspected and confirmed cases of cholera in
the country," Venezuelan Health Minister Eugenia Sader said during a
press conference. "We can rest easy. We have an excellent water
distribution network and all we are asking is that everyone takes
appropriate precautions. 4 others who were ill returned to Spain,
Mexico and Boston and are "being taken care of at this time," Sader
said.

The ill included a Dominican businessman whose family owns the
exclusive Cap Cana resort [not the resort where the wedding banquet
took place. - Mod.JW].

[It is not stated if any lobster meat was available for testing and,
if so, was found to harbor the cholera bacterium. It has been stated
that the lobster was undercooked, but boiling the crustacean is likely
to have killed the bacteria more rapidly even than adequately cooking
the meat.

No details of the meal overall are available to assess potential other
sources of the infection, but if the lobster was the vehicle of
transmission, it may well be the case that the contamination occurred
following cooking from, for example, contaminated ice.

ProMED posted some details regarding the Bston Massachusetts case, but
it is alleged that additional cases occurred in individuals returning
to Spain and Mexico for which we do not have specific information. -
