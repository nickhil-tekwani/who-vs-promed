Deer from Panola and Tallahatchie counties have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). A total of 2 cases of the debilitating deer disease have been confirmed in Panola and Tallahatchie counties, according to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks (MDWFP).

MDWFP received confirmation that a female white-tailed deer from Panola County and a female white-tailed deer from Tallahatchie County tested positive for CWD. These are the 1st deer to test positive for CWD in both counties.

The Panola County deer was a diseased deer report and the Tallahatchie County deer was hunter-harvested. MDWFP will be assessing management zone changes to include these counties as per the CWD Response Plan.

During the 2018 to 2019 season, MDWFP received more than 7000 samples through hunter-harvested, road-killed, and reported diseased deer. To date, Mississippi has 15 confirmed CWD-positive cases and 4 suspected CWD-positive cases awaiting confirmation.

The contagious and always fatal neurological disease is caused by a contagious fatal prion, or abnormal protein, that affects cervids such as white-tailed deer, elk and mule deer. For some animals, it may be a year or more before signs develop, which can include drastic weight loss, stumbling, listlessness and other neurological symptoms.

Infected animals shed prions through saliva, feces, blood, and urine. [So why is baiting dear with urine still allowed in many areas?] Other animals can become infected through direct contact with an infected animal and through indirect contact from an infected environment. Once the disease occurs in an area, the evidence demonstrates eradication is unlikely. There is no cure and no vaccine for the disease.

There are currently no documented cases of humans contracting CWD, either by interacting with deer or eating deer; however, MDWFP officials have previously said it can't be ruled out as a rare possibility.

[Although no human cases have been documented from consumption of CWD meat, it is advised to have your animal tested and to not consume meat from CWD-positive deer.

This disease continues to spread. As this is the end of many hunting seasons, we may see more positive test results as labs finish testing animals from this season's hunts. - Mod.TG
