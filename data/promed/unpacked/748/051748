Health authorities are urging Victorians to protect themselves
against mosquito bites because of fears the insects are carrying a
life-threatening virus that has not been diagnosed in a Victorian for
37 years. Victoria's chief health officer Dr John Carnie yesterday [22
Feb 2011] said ''sentinel chickens'' in the state's north, which are
designed to alert health authorities to emerging mosquito-borne
diseases, had tested positive for Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE]
virus this week.

It is the 2nd time the virus has been detected in the chickens, which
were strategically placed across the state after an outbreak of the
rare disease hit Victoria in 1974. No human cases have been noted in
Victoria since the 1974 epidemic. Dr Carnie said chickens were
diagnosed with the virus this week in Mildura, Robinvale, Kerang,
Barmah, and Tooleybuc across the border in New South Wales near Swan
Hill.

He said although the virus had not been detected in a human,
Victorians living along the Murray River should avoid being bitten by
mosquitoes. He said when outdoors people should wear long,
loose-fitting clothes, and use insect repellent containing picaridin
or DEET and ensure door and window screens were in good repair.

Dr Carnie said people with symptoms of the virus, which include
severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, tremor, and seizures, should
seek urgent medical attention. While some people with MVE experience
no or few symptoms, a small proportion will develop a severe viral
brain infection that can kill them or result in permanent brain
damage.

[The most recent human cases of Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) in
humans in Australia have occurred in the Western state and Northern
Territories in 2009, far distant from Victoria state. It is remarkable
that the health authorities in Victoria state have maintained an
active sentinel chicken surveillance effort for detection of MVE virus
transmission after a 37 year absence of human cases.

Recent heavy rains and flooding in Victoria, especially along the
Murray River have doubtless created a significant increase in mosquito
breeding habitats. MVE virus is transmitted by the common banded
mosquito (_Culex annulirostris_), which bites after sundown in the 1st
2 hours of the night. It is found throughout Australia. Avoidance of
mosquito bites it the only practical measure for prevention of MVE
virus infection. There is no commercially available vaccine.

An image of the common banded mosquito, the vector of MVE virus can
be viewed at the CSIRO (Australian Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation) website at

As Mod.CP pointed out in ProMED-mail archive number 20100417.1251,
MVE virus is considered to be close to Alfuy virus (together forming
the Murray Valley encephalitis virus species). Both species are
members of the Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses.
