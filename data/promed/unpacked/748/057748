Wildlife chiefs concerned over squirrel pox virus
-------------------------------------------------
A 2nd red squirrel has been struck down by a deadly disease, similar to myxomatosis, in what is the 1st outbreak in [Ireland].

Wildlife chiefs have raised concerns after the red squirrel with the squirrel pox virus was discovered on the lower slopes of the Sugar Loaf, near Kilmacanogue, Co Wicklow.

The virus is carried by [exotic] grey squirrels who do not appear to suffer from it. But they may have transferred it to the native Irish red squirrel. Squirrel pox virus (SQPV) is generally fatal to red squirrels, as they rapidly develop myxomatosis-type symptoms seen in rabbits -- such as swollen runny eyes -- and die within a matter of days.

The 1st death was discovered just before Christmas [2011] in the Hollywood area of Wicklow. The latest victim was found last Friday [13 Jan 2012].

Dr Ferdia Marnell of the National Parks and Wildlife Services confirmed the 2nd death and appealed to members of the public to contact them if they see any squirrels displaying the symptoms. "This is the 1st time we have seen this disease in the Republic," he said. Dr Marnell said that although there are no records of SQPV infecting humans, people are advised not to handle sick or dead squirrels.

[Squirrel pox is a viral disease that only affects squirrels. It is caused by a parapoxvirus that circulates naturally in gray and fox squirrel populations of the eastern part of North America. Infection with this virus results in fatal disease in red squirrels (_Sciurus vulgaris_), and it has resulted in extensive die-offs in the UK after its introduction in the island by grey squirrels (_Sciurus carolinensis_) from North America, which rarely die from the disease. This virus was the main contributor to the red squirrel decline observed in Britain in the last 2 decades.

Dispersal of grey squirrels in Ireland has been slower than that experienced in England and Wales. Until now, the disease was mainly found in England and Wales, sporadically in Scotland, and only recently in Northern Ireland (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110402.1024), and not elsewhere in the red squirrel's European range. Its appearance in Ireland is cause of great concern.
