[Details of the actual species of the affected "birds" (for example, chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese) are not included and would be appreciated.

The previous H5N1 epizootic in China's poultry occurred on 13 May 2013 in Tibet and was declared as resolved on 16 Jun 2013. During January 2014, a new epizootic is emerging: 2 outbreaks have been reported so far to the OIE, both reportedly starting on the same day (27 Dec 2013). Their geographic positions in 2 different, non-neighbouring provinces, Guizhou and Hubei (map at the bottom of OIE's summarising report at http://tinyurl.com/o4xhlrn), may be indicative of wide circulation of the virus.

Recently, a young woman returning from a visit to China (Beijing) has become the 1st case of A(H5N1) infection in North America. The unfortunately fatal infection must have been acquired in China, although the source and conditions under which the virus was acquired are, so far, unknown; no contact with fowl could be traced.

According to a detailed case report (see 20140112.2167282), the sequencing results of the said isolate show that it belongs to A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1. It could be useful to check the genetic relationship between the Canadian human isolate and the virus currently circulating in birds in China. - Mod.AS
