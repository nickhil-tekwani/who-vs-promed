Since the BVD [bovine viral diarrhea] eradication programme became compulsory in March 2016, 677 calves have tested positive for BVD in Northern Ireland, according to Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland (AHWNI).

The BVD eradication scheme in Northern Ireland has seen over 250 000 animals tested for BVD since March 2016, which means 0.68 percent of all the animals tested returned a positive result.

The BVD Eradication programme in Northern Ireland began on 1 Jan 2013 on a voluntary basis. Over 16 647 breeding herds have now joined the programme, with more than 11 000 joining since March [2016]. The tag and test regime is now in its 5th month of operation.

As a result of the scheme, over 684 412 animals have had their BVD status directly assigned since Jan 2013.

There have been 1677 calves identified as being BVD positive since compulsory testing began, with a further 2000 calves testing positive since the scheme began in 2013.

The Ulster Farmers' Union [UFU] Animal Health and Welfare committee recently met with AHWNI [Animal Health and Welfare Northern Ireland] implementation group to discuss current progress of the scheme during its 1st quarter and to raise issues experienced by some farmers with the scheme to date.

At the meeting, the UFU raised members' concerns over the length of time some results are taking to come back to farmers.

In response, AHWNI informed the committee that at this stage over 95 percent of results (204 962 results since March 2016) have been returned to the farmer within 7 days of receipt by the lab.

However, 5 percent taking more than 7 days to return, still means almost 11 000 results took more than a week to get back to the farmer. However, AHWNI assured the UFU that they are working hard to reduce this delay.

The meeting also offered an opportunity for AHWNI to present results of the BVD eradication programme in the Republic of Ireland since 2013.

Since the beginning of the eradication programme in the Republic of Ireland, the number of persistently infected animals has fallen from 13 868 (0.66 percent) to 2728 (0.15 percent).

The number of positive herds has fallen from 9479 (11.27 percent) to 1909 (2.65 percent) and the Republic of Ireland has now registered over 59 500 herds with BVD negative status, according to the AHWNI.

[BVDV is a pestivirus in the _Flaviviridae_ family and is closely related to classical swine fever (CSF) and ovine border disease (BD) viruses. BVDV occurs in 2 forms: noncytopathogenic and cytopathogenic. There are 2 antigenically distinct genotypes (types I and II), and virus isolates within these groups exhibit considerable biological and antigenic diversity.

Persistently viraemic healthy animals resulting from congenital infection can be readily identified by isolation of noncytopathogenic virus in cell cultures from blood or serum. It is necessary to use an immune-labelling method to detect the growth of virus in the cultures. Alternative methods based on direct detection of viral antigen or viral RNA in leukocytes are also available. Persistence of virus should be confirmed by resampling after an interval of at least 3 weeks. These animals will usually have no or low levels of antibodies to BVDV. Viraemia in acute cases is transient and can be difficult to detect. In fatal cases of haemorrhagic disease, virus can be isolated from tissues post-mortem. Confirmation of mucosal disease can be made by isolation of the cytopathogenic biotype of BVDV, particularly from intestinal tissues. Noncytopathogenic virus may also be detected, especially in blood.

The distribution of type I and type II BVDV appears to be worldwide; however, the prevalence of each type of virus varies considerably among regions. The distribution of viral subgenotypes is more restricted, with many viral subgenotypes being found only in certain regions of the world and, in some cases, only certain regions of a country. For further information on BVDV, see OIE's terrestrial manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BVD.pdf.

Currently there are 2 different approaches successfully being used for BVD control in BVD-affected countries: (1) systematic removal of persistently infected cattle from national cattle populations without vaccination and (2) accompanied by vaccination. Strict biosecurity measures have to be an integral part of any successful control program.

There are still deficits in the availability of efficacious live vaccines that are safe for all cattle, irrespective of pregnancy, and that confer effective fetal protection against both genotypes of BVDV.

The Scandinavian countries Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark have already eradicated BVD from their national herds.
