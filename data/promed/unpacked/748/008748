Fluid buildup in brain killed porpoise: Doctor
----------------------------------------------
Fluid buildup in the brain was likely behind the death of a harbour
porpoise rescued by the Vancouver Aquarium, animal rescue staff
announced yesterday [19 May 2011]. Siyay, a 2-year-old male porpoise,
died early Sunday morning [15 May 2011] after being saved 18 days
earlier off Salt Spring Island and receiving round-the-clock care.

A porpoise is a mammal related to dolphins and whales (see photo link
in Comments below).

Veterinarian Martin Haulena said the preliminary necropsy results
were a surprise because it found hydrocephalus -- a condition that may
have been caused by a parasite called protozoal encephalitis -- to be
the primary cause of Siyay's death. He said British Columbia vets
haven't seen this disease before in their examinations of dead sea
creatures.

"Why are marine animals getting infected by a terrestrial parasite?"
Haulena asked. "That is a huge issue. We have fresh tissues, which are
incredibly rare for us to have, so even in death he is going to be a
very important animal."

The sea mammal was also suffering from a lungworm-type disease,
gastric ulcers and parasites, he added. "This animal represents a
bigger loss for us just because it's a slightly rare species and the
close interaction that people had to have with him," Haulena said.

[Unfortunately, there is some confusing information presented by the
article.

Protozoal encephalitis is a pathologic condition, not the causative
organism. The cause of the porpoise's encephalitis, if it is due to a
protozoal organism, could be due to _Toxoplasma gondii_ or
_Sarcocystis neuronai_. Antibodies to _Neospora caninum_ have also
been found in several marine mammal species, so this causative
organism might be added to the list.

Hopefully, J.P. Dubey's laboratory at USDA/ARS or some other expert
laboratory will be able to help unravel which of these causative
organisms is responsible for the encephalitis that killed Siyay, the
2-year-old porpoise in Vancouver. It would be a shame if we didn't get
a definitive laboratory diagnosis as it appears good tissues have been
saved.
