The risk of mycobacterial [infection], [modes of] transmission of
mycobacteria from the environment to susceptible hosts, and cases of
infections in hospitals [can be found in] the references in Chapter 7
of the recently published book "The Ecology of Mycobacteria: Impact
on Animal's and Human's Health" (Eds. J. Kazda, I. Pavlik, J. O.
