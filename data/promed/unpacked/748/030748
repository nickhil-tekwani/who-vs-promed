Disease-Resistant Cassava Released
----------------------------------
Researchers from 3 public universities in [Kenya and other research
institutes under the Biotechnology Trust Africa (BTA) have released 6 new
cassava varieties to increase the production of the crop in the country.
The new varieties released to the farmers are 82/0049, 087/00196/Lipai,
55375, Mygera and senior 7-4 (ss4).
BTA principal researcher, Professor Charles Ochanda, said the new varieties
have been developed after a joint effort by researchers from the
universities of Nairobi, Egerton, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture
and Technology and Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (Kari) Thika and
Kakamega stations.
Ochanda, a lecturer at the University of Nairobi, said the new varieties
will be resistant to diseases like cassava mosaic, green cassava mite and
cassava blight.

[African cassava begomovirus (ACMV) and cassava bacterial blight (CBB) are
major pathogens of cassava in Africa. Cassava is an important subsistence
crop for 200 million people comprising 40 percent of the sub-Saharan
population. Any of 3 begomovirus species (ACMV, East African cassava mosaic
[EAVCMV and South African cassava mosaic virus [SACMV cause African
cassava mosaic disease [ACMD). ACMD is present in East, West, South and
Central Africa and adjacent islands. ACMD is a direct threat to the food
security of millions of Africans, particularly in East Africa.
The 3 viral species are transmitted by the whitefly, _Bemisia tabaci_.
Depending upon cultivar, viral species and environmental factors, ACMD can
reduce crop yields by more than 90 percent. Disease management involves
planting disease-free planting stock and use of resistant cultivars. Removal
of infected plants, late planting and wide spacing may reduce incidence of
infection.
Cassava bacterial blight is caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pathovar
_manihotis_. The bacterium infects cassava via wounds or stomates. Disease
management utilizes crop rotation, disease-free cultivars and resistant
cultivars.
Resistance to ACMV and CBB is highly correlated and when genes for
resistance to ACMV are used in a breeding program, resistance to CBB is
likely to be achieved.
