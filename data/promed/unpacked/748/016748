CALLING ALL VETERINARIANS
*************************
A ProMED post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>
Date: Tue 19 Oct 1999
From: Jack Woodall <woodall@promedmail.org>

Those of you who have been following the saga of the West Nile-like virus
in the Northeastern USA will have read that an alert veterinarian at the
Bronx Zoo realized that her birds were dying of an unusual encephalitis
before human cases appeared in the New York area. It also appears that
crows had been dying all over the Northeast for some weeks, but that this
information & that from the zoo did not reach the ears of public health
officials in time for the important connection to be made between the bird
& human cases, & therefore the human cases were initially misdiagnosed.
ProMED is unique in that it reports on one & the same list outbreaks in
humans, wildlife, captive wildlife, livestock & crop plants, & therefore
its readership includes both public health & veterinary public health
experts, livestock, wildlife & zoo veterinarians. This is a call to
encourage you to:
a) send in reports of wildlife & zoo-related outbreaks of potential public
health importance to: promed@promedmail.org
b) encourage your colleagues in wildlife & zoo practice to subscribe to
ProMED-mail so that future occurrences like this one will not pass
unnoticed for so long -- go to our website:
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html> to subscribe.
The more we are alert to unusual occurrences in zoos & wildlife, the better
protected out health will be.
