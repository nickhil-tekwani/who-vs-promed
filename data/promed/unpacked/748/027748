[These 4 cases were not available on the Saudi MOH page on 15 Dec 2021 when the last update was prepared. It appears as though the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (COVID-19) has affected both the reporting of MERS-CoV cases as well as possibly transmission or diagnosis.

As stated in the previous post (MERS-CoV (04): UAE, Saudi Arabia 20211215.8700274), "It would be interesting to know what proportion of laboratory negative for SARS-CoV-2 suspected COVID cases in Saudi Arabia were tested for MERS-CoV. The proportion of cases with history of camel contact has also increased during 2021. In 2019, 42% of primary cases had a history of contact with camels and 58% did not. In 2020, 26% of primary cases had a history of contact with camels and 74% did not. And in 2021, 59% of primary cases had a history of contact with camels and 41% did not. In 2021, no cases were designated as secondary cases (associated with contact with other confirmed case), while in 2019, 40% of reported cases were classified as secondary cases, and in 2020, 18% of confirmed cases were classified as secondary cases. (Calculations were done on spreadsheets prepared from data at source URL in section [2].)"
