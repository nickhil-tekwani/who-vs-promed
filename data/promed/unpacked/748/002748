Local health officials are warning residents about a stomach bug linked to unwashed produce. In recent months, doctors across Texas have reported 61 cases of cyclosporiasis. 10 of those cases are in Dallas County, 9 are in Tarrant, and 4 are in Collin. "We need to get the message out on washing produce," said Dallas County health director Zach Thompson. "Identifying the source will reduce the number of cases."

The intestinal parasite can cause diarrhea for weeks, fatigue, and weight loss and will begin showing 2 to 14 days after ingestion. It's not normally contagious through human contact, but spreads by the consumption of imported produce that's contaminated with feces. Russell Jones, chief epidemiologist of Tarrant County Public Health, advised consumers to wash raw produce to reduce the risk of infection. "Produce that is cooked is not a concern" he said in a written release. It's the raw produce like cilantro and salads that can be a problem."

The latest spread of cyclospora comes almost a year after cyclospora sickened hundreds across the country, including more than 150 in Texas. It takes a special lab test to detect, according to the medics.

[Cyclospora is usually transmitted to humans by berries contaminated with human waste used as fertilizer. In some previous outbreaks it has been linked to imported berries, but this can not be assumed before a case control study has been performed. The infection is usually self limiting in immunocompetent individuals. - Mod. EP
