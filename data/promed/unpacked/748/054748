Not all illegally smuggled birds are purchased off the street in Mexico,
but [many are actually removed from wild nesting sites in their natural
habitat and then later sold to well organized bird smuggling rings. The
sale of native wild caught birds is illegal in Mexico, but as in many
countries, Mexico lacks enough personnel to enforce such activities. The
increase and awareness of buying and breeding captive raised birds in
Southern California has also discouraged serious and responsible breeders
and pet owners not to purchase these "bargain birds" and has helped in the
control of other potential zoonotic diseases such as psittacosis . During
the 1970's through the 80's 50-100 cases of psittacosis were diagnosed and
investigated in San Diego County each year, this year we have only 3, so far.
