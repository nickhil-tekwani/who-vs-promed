Thailand: 21st Human Case of Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------
Thailand has reported its 21st human case of H5N1 avian influenza,
while an infected flamingo was found in Kuwait and new poultry
outbreaks surfaced in China, according to news reports today [Fri 11
Nov 2005].
An 18-month-old boy in Bangkok was diagnosed with the H5N1 virus
today, but he was already well on the way to recovery, according to
an Agence France-Presse (AFP) report quoting Thawat Sunthrajarn,
Thailand's disease control director. "He is recovering and almost
back to normal," Thawat said.
An Associated Press (AP) report said the boy became ill soon after
the death of 3 fighting cocks and a chicken kept in his household in
the Bangkok suburb of Minburi. According to the AFP report, Thawat
said the boy's 65-year-old grandmother also has symptoms, and test
results on her were awaited.
The boy's case is Thailand's 4th in the past month, according to AFP.
Before mid-October 2005, the country had gone for more than a year
with no human cases. 13 of the 21 cases there have been fatal.
