The most recent rabies outbreak in the Calussinga, Bie community
caused the deaths of 3 people between May and June [2011]. The Chief
of the Calussinga Health Center, Pedro Suende, yesterday [30 Jun 2011]
told the Jornal de Angola that the situation is of concern to the
local health authorities, so they are asking the public to join the
anti-rabies campaign.

"We are working to inform the public so that people will bring dogs
to the vaccination posts to help avoid unusual situations such as
bites from dogs that could be rabid," he said.

The responsible official of the Calussinga Health Center considers
the current situation to be serious and said that recently more than
30 people with dog bites were attended to in the Calussinga Health
Center. The head of the Andulo health section, Francisco Chiquete,
said that to counteract the outbreak of new cases, they are taking
measures, but lamented the lack of cooperation from the people during
the domestic animal vaccination campaign. "The local population does
not collaborate with the sanitary authorities, providing unjustified
arguments for not having their animals vaccinated," he added.

[Previous cases were reported in Cabinda province, an enclave in far
northwestern Angola. The cases above, in Bie province, occurred in the
central part of the country. Rabies cases appear to be more widely
spread than before -- a cause for real concern that illustrates the
need for public education and an aggressive campaign to vaccinate
dogs.
