I am astonished at this claim that the explanation for the Belgian case of
BSE is "The hypothesis of a sporadic case has been confirmed."
This notion of a "sporadic" or "spontaneous" origin for cases of BSE is
without any experimental or epidemiological basis. The hypothesis has been
suggested in the past because of the belief that the majority of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases in humans arise "sporadically" or
"spontaneously". However, there is absolutely no evidence that such occurs
in cattle.
On the other hand, Belgium is a country with a recognised problem of illegal
usage of hormonal growth promoters in cattle. Are we to accept assurances
that while Belgian farmers might commonly use illegal growth promoters they
would never use a feed ration containing illegal meat and bone meal?
