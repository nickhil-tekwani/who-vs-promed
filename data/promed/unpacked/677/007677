Urgent and more information is required from Namibian or other reliable sources to verify the extent of the current measles outbreak in Namibia. Five specimens tested IgM positive for measles. These were sent by general practitioners in Windhoek, Namibia to a private laboratory in Cape Town and were confirmed positive by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) in South Africa. The patients (4 males and one female), ranging in age between 8 and 44 years old, had specimens taken on 3, 4, 6, 9, and 20 Aug 2014, respectively.

More information is required in order to inform health workers and the general public on how they can adequately protect themselves and be on the alert for suspected cases of fever, rash and one of the following: cough, conjunctivitis, and coryza.

A measles outbreak in Viet Nam has caused the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue a travel notice for travelers to the Southeast Asian country. The World Health Organization (WHO) puts the total measles cases at 10 859 suspected cases, including 3688 confirmed cases and 2 measles deaths as of 20 Aug 2014. CDC recommends travelers to Viet Nam protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (one dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine).

According to WHO, measles is a highly contagious viral disease which affects mostly children. It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10-12 days after infection, include high fever, runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards.

There is no specific treatment for measles, and most people recover within 2-3 weeks. However, particularly in malnourished children and people with reduced immunity, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, encephalitis, severe diarrhoea, ear infection, and pneumonia. Measles can be prevented by immunisation.

Measles virus spread initiated at international mass gatherings in Europe, 2011 (By: Santibanez S, Prosenc K, Lohr D, Pfaff G, Jordan O, Mankertz)

Abbreviated extract
-------------------
Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (EUR) has adopted the goal of eliminating endemic measles by 2015. In this region, a vaccine coverage of 95 per cent or higher with 2 doses of a measles containing vaccine (MCV) must be achieved and maintained in order to terminate endemic transmission of measles virus (MV) and reach a low annual incidence (under one case per one million population). However, the current measles situation in EUR is characterised by considerable differences in vaccine coverage and incidence across and within countries. Only a few countries report absence or sporadic occurrence of measles with a low annual incidence, while others observe resurgence of measles after a long period of low incidence (for example, Slovenia) or are still experiencing outbreaks with hundreds or thousands of cases (for example, Germany and Italy). In 2013, the majority of the EUR countries have reported an annual incidence of over one case per one million population (http://data.euro.who.int/cisid/?TabID=335279, data as of 2 Apr 2014), indicating that the elimination target has not yet been met. This situation implies the urgent need to uncover and analyse chains of MV transmission with the objective to identify vulnerable groups in the European population.

Synopsis: Three parallel transmission chains of measles virus (MV) variant D8-Villupuram (D8-V) originated from 2 coinciding international mass gathering (MG) events in Rimini, Italy in June 2011. MV D8-V was independently introduced into Germany by 2 unvaccinated persons and into Slovenia by one unvaccinated person who had attended these events. Secondary spread of D8-V was restricted to 2 generations of transmission in Slovenia as well as in Germany, where the virus was further disseminated at another MG. Serological and epidemiological investigation of the D8-V-associated German and Slovenian cases revealed different antibody responses and age distributions. Primary infected young persons between 11-27 years old were affected in Germany, whereas the group of Slovenian cases comprised adults aged from 28-47 years and a high proportion (9/14; 64 per cent) of patients with secondary vaccine failure (SVF). Our study demonstrates that monitoring of MV transmission chains in an international context and adequate serological investigation of cases with remote vaccination can contribute to identifying susceptibility gaps.

The Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) Maguindanao recorded 519 measles cases from January up to 27 Aug 2014. According to health officer Dr Tahir Sulaik, there were only around 100 cases during the same period last year [2013]. The town of Datu Odin Sinsuat had the most cases at 105. This is followed by Shariff Aguak with 81 cases, Parang with 57 cases, and Sultan Kudarat with 34 cases. Sulaik said some of the residents of these towns believe that measles is merely a part of a child's growth.

These towns are also densely populated, causing the disease to spread faster. IPHO has also recorded 9 deaths due to measles complications since January [2014]. Sulaik added that they did not fail in reminding parents to bring their children to health centers for immunization or to avail themselves of the vaccination given by evaluators in different barangays (districts) in Maguindanao. However, there are still some who refuse to do so.

IPHO-Maguindanao launched its measles and polio vaccination campaign at Datu Salibo town on Wednesday [3 Sep 2014], where all of the 17 barangays were submerged in flooding due to the bad weather prevailing in Mindanao.

[Maguindanao is a province of the Philippines located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Its capital is Shariff Aguak. It borders Lanao del Sur to the north, Cotabato to the east, and Sultan Kudarat to the south. A map showing the location of Maguindanao can be accessed at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maguindanao. Previously, in Measles update (35), a total of 7 fatalities and 1228 cases of measles were reported from Davao City, the largest city in Mindanao. Such figures explain the predominance of the Philippines as a source of many cases of travel-related measles throughout the world. - Mod.CP

The measles outbreak that started in early July [2014] in Honiara, Solomon Islands has grown to at least 550 cases, the Solomon Islands Health Ministry said recently. In a Radio New Zealand report today [1 Sep 2014], the permanent secretary of the ministry, Dr Lester Ross, says it's likely there are thousands more cases that haven't yet been reported. At least 2 children have died from complications of measles. A measles mass vaccination campaign will target all people aged from 6 months to 30 years of age, the report states. The outbreak has spread past Honiara, as cases are now being reported in Malaita, Guadalcanal, Isabel, Western province, Temotu, and Renbel.

Measles or rubeola, is an acute, highly communicable viral disease that is characterized by Koplik spots in the cheek or tongue very early in the disease. A couple of days later, a red blotchy rash appears, 1st on the face, and then spreads, lasting 4-7 days. Other symptoms include fever, cough and red watery eyes. The patient may be contagious from 4 days prior to the rash appearance to 4 days after rash appearance.

The disease is more severe in infants and adults. Complications from measles, which are reported in up to 20 percent of people infected, include seizures, pneumonia, deafness and encephalitis.
