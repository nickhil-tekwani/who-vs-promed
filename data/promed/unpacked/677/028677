A follow-up for the previously reported outbreak of legionnaires' disease
among French travellers to Istanbul, Turkey is now available. Seventeen
people, 3 women and 14 men aged from 49 to 82 years (median 65 years), have
been reported to have developed respiratory symptoms after staying at the
Hotel Festival in Istanbul since September 10, 1997. Four people have died
(69 to 77 years of age), seven people have recovered, and six are still in
hospital.
_Legionella_ infection has been confirmed in 13 people (_Legionella
pneumophila_, serogroup 1 was isolated from five), investigations are
continuing for three, and one of the cases who died had shown clinical
symptoms suggestive of legionellosis but laboratory confirmation could not
be obtained. Three of the four cases who died had a bacteriologically
confirmed diagnosis of legionellosis.
The epidemic curve shows that one case occurred at the beginning of
September, and the remaining cases during the three weeks from October 2 to
October 23, 1997. All but the first case had stayed at the hotel between
September 23 and October 16, 1997. To date, no cases who stayed at the
hotel after October 16 (the date when the hotel was identified as the
probable source of the infection) have been identified.
According to a tour operator, the hotel could have accommodated 3300 people
between the September 1 and October 22, 1997, an average of 470 people each
week. The 12 cases confirmed during a three week exposure period at the
hotel imply an attack rate in the order of 1%. The report indicates that
the attack rate in legionellosis epidemics is usually between 0.1% and 5%.
