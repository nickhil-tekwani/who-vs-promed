Multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheeses
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC is collaborating with public health and regulatory officials in several states and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections (listeriosis). The joint investigation indicates that Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses made by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin are the likely source of this outbreak.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _Listeria_ obtained through testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 5 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_ have been reported from 4 states. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: Illinois (1), Indiana (1), Minnesota (2), and Ohio (1).

Among persons for whom information is available, dates that illness was diagnosed range from 20 May 2013 to 17 Jun 2013. All 5 ill persons were hospitalized. Ill persons range in age from 31 years to 67 years, with a median age of 58 years, and 80 percent are female. One illness in a pregnant woman resulted in a miscarriage. One death was reported in Minnesota.

The outbreak can be visually described with a chart showing the number of persons who were diagnosed each day [http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/cheese-07-13/epi.html]. This chart is called an epidemic curve or epi curve. Clinical specimens that were collected after 22 Jun 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.

About 800 laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis are reported each year in the United States, and typically 3 or 4 outbreaks are identified and reported to CDC annually. Some foods that have been linked to outbreaks in recent years are Mexican-style soft cheeses, imported ricotta salata cheese, whole cantaloupe, raw sprouts, and pre-cut celery.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and trace-back investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses manufactured by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company are the likely source of this outbreak of listeriosis.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures in the month before becoming ill. All 5 ill persons reported consuming a soft cheese. Information about specific cheeses consumed is available for 4 of the ill persons. Of those, 3 either definitely or probably ate Les Freres cheese made by Crave Brothers before getting sick. Investigation of specific types of cheeses consumed by other ill persons is ongoing.

Laboratory tests conducted by the Minnesota Department of Agriculture on samples of Les Freres and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses made by Crave Brothers from 2 retail stores indicate the presence of the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_. Further testing and confirmation of the results are pending.

On 3 Jul 2013, Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin voluntarily recalled its Les Freres, Petit Frere, and Petit Frere with Truffles cheeses with make dates of 1 Jul 2013 or earlier due to possible _L. monocytogenes_ contamination. The recalled cheeses were distributed nationwide through retail and foodservice outlets as well as by mail orders.

The FDA is conducting an inspection at Crave Brothers' processing facility in coordination with the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture. FDA is working closely with CDC, Crave Brothers, and public health authorities in states where illnesses occurred to determine the exact cause of contamination.

[The CDC report above concerns 5 cases of listeriosis in 4 states, with 1 death (in Minnesota) and 1 miscarriage. The report indicates that the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ was identified, presumably on the basis of genotyping, in cheeses made by Crave Brothers Farmstead Cheese Company of Waterloo, Wisconsin. Les Frere and the smaller version Petit Frere sold in wooden boxes are washed rind, semi-soft, soft ripened cheeses; for a picture of them, see http://www.cravecheese.com/cheese-detail.php?Petit-Fr-re-5.

The cheeses are described as being "hand-ladeled [sic, probably ladled by hand], washed regularly with brine, and matured for a minimum of 3 weeks on site" (http://culturecheesemag.com/node/1227).

On 3 Jul 2013, Crave Brothers recalled the 3 implicated cheeses with make dates of 1 Jul 2013 or earlier. The recalled cheeses were distributed nationwide through retail and foodservice outlets and mail order. More cases can be anticipated because of the long incubation period for listeriosis, with symptoms sometimes not showing up until 2 months after people have consumed the tainted food.

Listeriosis is a worldwide zoonosis, caused by _Listeria monocytogenes_, transmitted to humans by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection results in diarrhea and, in some patients, invasive disease that includes bacteremia without an evident focus, meningitis, abscesses in the brain and spinal cord, endocarditis, and intrauterine infection. Infection during pregnancy can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn, or stillbirth. Invasive listeriosis is rare (about 2500 cases occur annually in the USA), but [that type of] the disease has an overall mortality rate of 20 to 30 percent. Newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses (such as, HIV-infected patients) are most susceptible to invasive disease.
