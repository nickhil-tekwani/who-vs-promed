Experts are calling a disease killing finches in Atlantic Canada a "significant outbreak."

The Nova Scotia Bird Society has put out an alert about the disease, which causes lesions in the throat and esophagus of finches.

"At this point 14 finches from the N.S., P.E., N.L. and N.B. [Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick] were submitted to Atlantic Veterinarian College in P.E.I. A necropsy was done on a number of them and the findings, together with the clinical symptoms, indicate trichomonosis," wrote Fiep de Bie, a wildlife technician with the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative, in an email.

He notes the autopsies are not yet complete but the findings so far prompted the society to make a statement.

"Considering the videos, pictures and telephone conversations, plus the preliminary necropsies reports, we believe it is safe to say that this is what we are dealing with," David Currie, president of the Nova Scotia Bird Society, wrote in the post.

"Plus, it is certainly more widespread and therefore a significant outbreak. It started earlier than usual, possibly due to the warm weather we experienced early in the summer." He said it's possible the parasite can be passed on through hummingbird feeders, but it would be low risk.

Currie advised that the practice of continuing with suet -- a combination of animal fat and other ingredients to attract some birds -- is not a good idea. "Summer has no shortage of available protein and fat, so take it down. These suet cakes often have seeds encased that fall to the ground to attract infected and uninfected birds."

He said sprinkling food on the ground is an easy way to spread the parasite, and that birdbaths should also be taken in. "We are asking people to consider removing seed feeders until colder weather is upon us. I fully realize how much people love to see the bird life in their yards but birds do not become dependent on your feeders," he wrote.

"In winter, conservation of energy is important and having regular food sources has a benefit. In summer, there is no biological benefit to feeding birds."

He said parasites have been surfacing in every Nova Scotia county this year [2017], and though the disease can't be given to humans, dogs or cats, it can infect other birds and chickens.

[_Trichomonas gallinae_ is a common protozoan parasite of pigeons (Columbiformes) which principally infects the upper alimentary tract where it can cause necrotic ingluvitis. Epidemic mortality in columbiform species has been previously reported, and the parasite may infect other avian taxa such as birds of prey and songbirds. Trichomoniasis has been postulated to be a factor contributing to the extinction of the passenger pigeon _Ectopistes migratorius_ and has been shown to be a significant cause of nestling mortality in the island-endemic pink pigeon _Nesoenas mayeri_ and in the Iberian Peninsula population of the Bonelli's eagle _Hieraaetus fasciatus_.
