Bubonic plague outbreak hits southern Colorado
Infected Fleas Are Spreading The Plague Through Prairie Dog Colonies
------------------------------
Residents in southern El Paso county are being warned to take immediate
precautions as an outbreak of bubonic plague is spreading through prairie
dog colonies.
The plague has been detected in various parts of the county for years now,
but this outbreak has the El Paso county health department worried and
they're warning people to protect their pets.
Dr. Tom Wood of the El Paso county health department says, "The thing you
worry about with dogs is [when the dog] brings in a sick or dying prairie
dog, and then the fleas are on the owner, who is then exposed to the fleas.
The thing we worry about with cats is they actually contract the infection
and transmit it to people."
Health officials say infected fleas spread the disease, which results in
flu-like symptoms, and that if you have aches and a fever, see your doctor
right away.

[Plague (_Yersinia pestis_) is enzootic in the south and western parts of
the US, including Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. The usual
infected rodent in the USA is the prairie dog, and less often, squirrels.
There are about 10 cases each year in humans in the USA, who usually become
infected when bitten by the flea vector or, less commonly, by direct
contact with the infected rodent. The flea vector of _Y. pestis_
preferentially feeds on its rodent host but will occasionally feed on a
human. Infection in the flea leads to obstruction of its gastrointestinal
tract, causing it to regurgitate the bacilli while attempting to feed. Cats
and other mammals occasionally become infected via the same mechanism as
humans.
Animal owners should be reminded of a number of new and excellent flea
control products available through your veterinarian for cats or dogs. -
