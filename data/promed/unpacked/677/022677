Outbreak of Chickenpox in Guinea Reaches Lofa
----------------------------------------
Health workers assigned to the border town of Yealla Town, Zorzor District, Lofa County have expressed fear for the lives of the residents of the area following the outbreak of chickenpox in towns on the Guinean side of the border.

The second clinical screener at the Yealla Health Post, Tommy G. Flomo, informed our reporter who visited the area that if nothing is done to contain the spread of the disease, residents along the border towns would come in contact with it. The recent outbreak of chickenpox in the neighboring Guinean towns of Kpawu, Walemai, Balogisia, Koyanma, etc. is posing: "a serious health hazard for the communities in Liberia," the health worker said. To confirm Mr. Flomo's assertion, our reporter, who toured some part of Yealla Town was informed by some of the residents that they fear for the lives of their children attending school there. According to them, some of the students have complained that their counterparts from Guinea have also contracted the disease. "People affected by this disease in recent times come in their numbers on a daily basis to the Yealla Clinic alone. We are therefore worried for the health needs and concerns of our residents," a medical practitioner stated. Meanwhile, the clinic has appealed to the government to supply the requisite drugs or vaccines to contain the spread of the disease.

[Chickenpox is a contagious disease caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It causes a blister-like rash, itching, tiredness, and fever. Chickenpox can be serious, especially in babies, adults, and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads easily from infected people to others who have never had chickenpox or never received the chickenpox vaccine. Chickenpox spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. VZV also causes shingles in adults and chickenpox can be contracted from adults with shingles.

A person with chickenpox can spread the disease from 1 to 2 days before they get the rash until all their chickenpox blisters have formed scabs. It takes from 10 to 21 days after exposure to a person with chickenpox or shingles for someone to develop chickenpox.

For most people, getting chickenpox once provides immunity for life. However, for a few people, they can get chickenpox more than once. Chickenpox vaccine is very safe and effective at preventing the disease. Chickenpox vaccine prevents almost all cases of severe disease.

Lofa is a county in the northernmost portion of the West African nation of Liberia. One of 15 counties that comprise the first-level of administrative division in the nation, it has six districts. Voinjama serves as the capital. As of the 2008 Census, it had a population of 270,114, making it the fourth most populous county in Liberia.
