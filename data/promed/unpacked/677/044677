The Trang Public Health Office is urging people to eliminate mosquito breeding sites to prevent dengue outbreaks. Dr. Witoon Leungdilok, Trang Public Health physician, said that dengue fever patients have already been diagnosed frequently between 1 Jan and 17 Feb, this year [2014].

There have been 1433 patients with dengue fever, one of whom died. However, it's expected that the incidence of dengue this year [2014] will not be as severe as in 2013, when 152 768 dengue patients were identified, the highest number in 20 years. Of the sufferers, 132 died. Even so, this year [2014] may see up to 80 000-100 000 patients.

The Ministry of Public Health has instructed the Public Health Office nationwide to encourage people to eliminate mosquito breeding sites around households, especially in the areas where dengue patients were found last year [2013]. Mosquito breeding sites should be eliminated every week.

From analysis of data on the dengue situation in 2013, the highest number of dengue patients occurs in the adolescent group aged 15-24, followed by children aged 10-14, children aged 5-9 years, and adults aged 25-34. This year [2014], teenagers are still the most vulnerable group due a lifestyle that brings risks of being bitten by mosquitoes while enjoying activities outside the classroom, or being outdoors at night for a long time.

[According to the above newswire, 1433 dengue fever cases were reported from 1 Jan to 17 Feb 2014 with one death.
Last year [2013], Thailand experienced one of its worst outbreaks in the last 20 years, with over 135 000 reported cases, including some deaths http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/tmp-pmv/notices-avis/notices-avis-eng.php?id=44.
There is no vaccine to protect against dengue. Developing a vaccine against dengue/severe dengue has been challenging, although there has been recent progress in vaccine development. WHO provides technical advice and guidance to countries and private partners to support vaccine research and evaluation. Several candidate vaccines are in various phases of trials.

Outbreaks of dengue fever have become increasingly frequent over the past 25 years. Background information on dengue in the region is available from the general ProMED-mail list. The postings below can be found at http://www.promedmail.org.
