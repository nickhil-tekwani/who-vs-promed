Ugandan Health Worker Dies Of Marburg Virus, Ebola Relative
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan Ministry of Health is reporting today that a 30-year-old male health care worker died of Marburg hemorrhagic fever on [30 Sep2014].

The gentleman had been a radiographer, or X-ray technician, at the Mpigi Health Centre IV, but was recruited 2 months ago for a similar position at Mengo Hospital, about 20 miles (33 km) away. When he felt ill on [17 Sep 2014], he traveled back to Mpigi for treatment since "he felt more comfortable with a facility that he had worked with for a long time."

Today's [6 Oct 2014] statement from Elioda Tumwesigye, Minister of State for General Duties & Holding the Portfolio of Minister for Health, describes a total of 80 people who were in contact with the man have been identified and isolated to follow for signs and symptoms during the 21-day incubation period, the same incubation period for Ebola.

Most concerning is that 38 of the contacts are health care workers from Mengo Hospital, including the man's brother, and 22 health care workers from Mpigi Health Center IV. The remaining 20 contacts are residents of the Kasese district.

The official reports that the man's brother has already developed signs consistent with Marburg infection. He has been quarantined and isolated for further monitoring while his blood samples are being analyzed at the Uganda Virus Research Institute.
