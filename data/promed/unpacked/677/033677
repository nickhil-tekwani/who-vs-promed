Around 300 cattle, which died on an Indigenous-owned station in the Northern Territory this month [June 2013], are believed to have contracted botulism.

The stock on Warrigundu Station, 300 kilometres [186 mi] south east of Katherine, were reportedly vaccinated for the disease 4 days before the 1st cows started dying.

Garry Cook, from the Indigenous Land Corporation (ILC), says the source of the botulism is still unknown, but it's most likely to have occurred in decaying animal carcasses.

"We're are really perplexed about what's happened because these cattle have been vaccinated every year. They were freshly vaccinated and turned out of the yards into this particular paddock," he said.

"So why these particular animals succumbed to something despite vaccination is something the Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries [DPIF] is still working with us on."

Earlier this year [2013], the station was named as one of the best Indigenous-owned and run businesses in Australia by the Federal Government.

Mr Cook says this is the 1st time the ILC has lost so many cattle under its management of properties in northern Australia.

"The ILC runs 96 000 head of cattle across Australia and this is the 1st time anything like this has happened to us. The management protocols and procedures here on Hodgson Downs (Warrigundu) are the same we apply across all the stations," he said.

"With vaccination against botulism every year, supplementation with phosphorus over every wet season, we are nonplussed to say the least. The NT Department of Primary Industry issued a statement to ABC Rural, which confirms the cattle died from botulism.

"The DPIF understands that the cattle were vaccinated, but even properly vaccinated cattle can succumb if the amount of toxin is high enough to overpower the animal's immune system.

"The investigating veterinarian determined that there were no issues with access to feed and water, and the affected animals were seen to be in good condition," the statement read.

"The circumstances that led to the botulism outbreak are still being examined, to aid in preventing similar episodes in the future."

[Botulism is a toxin produced _Clostridium botulinum_. The bacteria grow in low oxygen (anaerobic) environments. Botulinum toxins are the most potent known. Illness occurs either by ingesting the toxin or the bacteria (which grows and then produces toxin). Botulism affects many species, including humans. The signs of illness are the same in all. The onset is rapid and can be fatal without treatment.

_C. botulinum_ is found worldwide within the intestinal tracts of mammals and fish, and can also be found in soil or sediment. Animals become infected by ingesting vegetation that is contaminated with the botulinum toxin (such as decaying hay or grain) or through direct contact with soil that contains the bacteria. Cattle or sheep that are phosphorus (a mineral) deficient are prone to chew on bones, increasing their chance of ingesting botulinum bacteria or its toxin from the environment.

Botulism causes progressive paralysis, weakness, difficulty swallowing or chewing, and vision problems. Signs of illness can be seen as soon as 2 hours and up to 2 weeks after toxin exposure. Severe complications involve paralysis of the heart and respiratory muscles, leading to death.

In some areas, such as the Northern Territory, vaccination is available. Where it is available it should be used. Additionally the animals should be fed a balanced diet to minimize their desire to chew on old bones.

Botulism may be found in deceased animal bones. When other animals eat, or chew on those bones or other portions of a dead animal they can become infected with botulism. Often cattle are seen to chew on bones when they are phosphorus deficient. Yet these animals were being supplemented with phosphorus.

If these animals are being fed hay, it is possible the hay is the culprit. Small animals that may be deceased and are picked up in the baling process can be a perfect medium for botulism. Then when the animals eat the hay they are exposed to the botulism and die.
