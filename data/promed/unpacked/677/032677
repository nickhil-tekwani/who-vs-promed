From the report, it appears that everyone has jumped to the conclusion that the cause must be a virus. However, there is no information on white blood cell counts and on platelets. Assuming viral causation without clinical/laboratory clues is likely to mislead.

Leptospirosis must be considered as a diagnosis since clinical features are consistent, the season (post-monsoon) is right, the region is leptospirosis-endemic, chikungunya and dengue have been excluded, and, reading between lines, only adults have been involved.

Laboratory testing for leptospirosis requires a competent microbiology lab; viral tests are mostly kit-based.

On the other hand, if this turns out to be a new emerging infectious disease, valuable time (several weeks) has already been lost from appropriate investigations. Unless endemic diseases are under proactive public health surveillance constantly, any signal of a new disease will not be picked up quickly. India must establish case-based disease surveillance spanning public and private sectors and quality assured laboratory service in support of surveillance.

[There have been occasional reports of undiagnosed febrile diseases in India recently. In the report referred to above, chikungunya virus infection apparently was ruled out by an unspecified test, and in another report, malaria, chikungunya and dengue were discarded. In a previous report, scrub typhus was suspected. There is insufficient information about these cases to speculate on which etiological agent or agents might be involved.

Dr. John points out the need for timely field surveillance efforts coupled with laboratory support to determine which etiological agents are responsible for these cases. He also indicates that leptospirosis should be included in the list of rule outs. Additional information including a more complete clinical description of these cases and any laboratory results would be appreciated.
