The new meningococcal vaccine in the UK is a conjugate. I believe it is
Chiron's with meningococcal [group C capsular material conjugated to Tetanus.

AFAIK the new vaccine is licensed only in the UK. But it is likely to be
licensed more widely soon. It is a conjugate vaccine (meningococcal
polysaccharide coat proteins attached to a larger, highly immunogenic
protein), and very similar technically - and presumably clinically - to Hib
vaccine. It is currently being used as fast as it can be produced. See my
web site:
<http://www.fam-english.demon.co.uk/MeningoCampaignSurrey.htm#VaxInfo> for
sparse details,
<http://www.fam-english.demon.co.uk/MenCVaxCampaign.htm> for lots of
detail) for more info.
Talking to colleagues, we seem to have had an enormous surge in
meningococcal disease in UK. We've certainly seen a few, but other
colleagues seem to have seen really large numbers. Presumably the outbreak
of flu-like illness (some of which may even be true influenza) plays a part
in this. Possibly the social mixing over the holiday period also
contributed - we seem to have seen temporal clustering of cases in the
first week of January.

All the public need to know about the meningitis C vaccine recently
incorporated in to the UK immunisation programme is available in a question

Public Health.

The recent posting's mention of, "... a lethal form of meningitis ..."
could be misinterpreted. Although meningococcal meningitis and
meningococcal septicemia [=bacteremia+sickness are both caused by
_Neisseria meningitidis_, they otherwise have little in common.
Meningitis presents with the classic clinical features: stiff neck, fever,
photophobia etc. Septicemia presents as shock, or hemorrhagic purpura, or
other systemic catastrophe. In fact, patients with septicemia usually do
NOT have meningitis, either clinically or pathologically, and most patients
with meningitis do not develop septicemia, at least in the U.S. Adrenal
hemorrhage is often found in
meningococcal septicemia, and also in pneumococcal (_Streptococcus
pneumoniae_) and haemophilus (_Haemophilus influenzae_) septicemia, but
infrequently in meningitis. Septicemia has a much more fulminant course,
poor response to treatment, and much worse prognosis. The confusion spawned
by the organism's name, 'meningitidis', can be lethal, as more than an
occasional diagnosis of meningococcal septicemia is delayed because the
patient has no meningeal signs.
