South Darfur
----------
According to reports received from the area, 3 displaced persons have died and another 6 have been infected with yellow fever in Kalma camp, South Darfur on Saturday, 1 Dec [2012].

Ali Yaqoub, head sheikh of Kalma camp, told Radio Dabanga that residents from different sectors of the camp have been infected with the disease and added that 2 residents passed away after suffering from heavy bleedings. The sheikh said that the 3rd victim died on the way to the hospital.

Yaqoub informed Radio Dabanga that another 6 residents have been infected with yellow fever and pointed out that they demanded health authorities to provide them with vaccinations at an earlier stage, in anticipation of the fear that the disease would spread. He claims that the health authorities have not responded so far.

The sheikh added that after the disease emerged in the camp, they requested the authorities again to provide them with vaccinations but he claims they did not respond.

The sheikh called on the health authorities to vaccinate the displaced as soon as possible, as well as to start the spraying campaigns in the camp to contain the spread of mosquitoes. Additionally, he called for granting access to humanitarian organizations to provide aid.

For his part, South Darfur's Minister of Health, Ahmed al-Tayyeb, acknowledged the emergence of 'suspected cases of yellow fever' in Kalma camp in an interview with Radio Dabanga. The minister stated he could not confirm if those cases are yellow fever until blood samples are analyzed by the federal lab. He revealed that the samples are currently being taken and will be sent to the federal lab for analysis.

At the same time, South Darfur's Ministry of Health stated that the 1st phase of the vaccination campaign in East Jebel Marra has been concluded. The minister noted that the 2nd phase will begin in the coming days, including the localities of Belail and Nyala as well as the state's main camps.

He attributed the delay of the campaign to the late arrival of the vaccines.

Central Darfur
-----------
Sources from Um Dukhan in Central Darfur, informed Radio Dabanga on Saturday [1 Dec 2012] that 3 people died and another 7 were infected with yellow fever.

Central Darfur's Minister of Health, Issa Mohamed Moussa Ahmed, denied the deaths in Um Dukhan and stressed that one new case of the disease has emerged in the locality.

Additionally, the minister disclosed in an interview with Radio Dabanga the emergence of 3 new cases in the localities of Zalingei and another case in Wadi Saleh.

He also revealed an increase in the yellow fever incidence in Central Darfur from 362 to 387 and an increase in the death toll from 78 to 80. The minister explained that on Sunday another person passed away as a result of the disease in Zalingei.

The minister attributed the emergence of new cases in Um Dukhan, Bendessey, Mukjar and Rongo Tass to the failure in expanding the vaccination campaign to those localities in the 1st phase.

Lastly, the minister announced that 4 Dec [2012] is the last day of the vaccination campaign in the 4 localities and called on the residents to visit the vaccination centers as soon as possible.

From its part, the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that the yellow fever death toll in Sudan amounts to 110, a percentage of 4.29 per cent of all cases. The WHO added that 23 localities in Darfur have been affected by the disease.

[The 4.29 per cent case fatality rate cannot be correct. With 110 fatal cases, a 4.29 per cent case fatality rate implies that there have been about 2500 total cases, far above the reported number so far. A more usual case fatality rate range is 15-30 per cent. No mention is made about the surveillance strategy being employed. Case numbers in Central and South Darfur continue to rise. Whether successful vaccination of 80 per cent of susceptible individuals, with a halt in new cases, can be accomplished within the 10-12 day time limit specified when the campaign began is still an open question. Timely surveillance over this wide geographic area is a challenge, especially in the face of ongoing insecurity.

[2] UNAMID support

In an effort to combat the spread of yellow fever in Darfur, the African Union - United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) has leant its critical logistics support to the Sudanese Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO) in their fight to save lives.

The urgency to address the disease, in which the 1st suspected case was registered in September [2012], came in late October following a spike in the number of those cases in Central Darfur and a spread to the region's other states. As a result of the outbreak, 2.4 million doses of the vaccine against yellow fever were made available for Sudan by the International Coordination Group on Vaccines, which controls the global stock of vaccines.

Upon receipt of the vaccines, the 1st batches were airlifted by UNAMID from Khartoum to Darfur on 18 Nov [2012] with additional batches brought shortly thereafter by the Government of Sudan. The Mission was further requested to airlift several hundred tons of injection materials and other items from State capitals to localities.

With the medication in place and facilities ready to administer it, vaccination campaigns began in West Darfur on 20 Nov [2012], in North Darfur on 24 Nov [2012] and in Central and South Darfur on 25 Nov [2012].

The Mission's assistance has also included security escorts, technical services and medical expertise, as well as the use of assets including generators for rural medical facilities and isolation tents.

UNAMID is currently arranging for the transportation of large quantities of insecticide which will be used for vector control in internally displaced person camps and in the Central Darfur town of Zalingei.

"We are here to help the people of Darfur. By working together with our humanitarian partners and the Ministry of Health we are able to save lives," said UNAMID Acting Joint Special Representative and Joint Chief Mediator a.i. AÃ¯chatou Mindaoudou.

[Logistical support in this geographically difficult area is most welcome, as, of course, are the critically important supplies of YF vaccine and equipment. One hopes that larvicides are among the insecticides being provided, and that adequate, trained technical help for insecticide application is available. - Mod.TY]
