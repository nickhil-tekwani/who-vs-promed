Outbreak Of Ebola Fever in Northern Uganda, Update 17 Oct 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: Ebola fever, dormant since an outbreak of the disease at Kikwit in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 1995 which killed 245 people, has
suddenly resurfaced in Gulu, northern Uganda. This is a highly contagious
and deadly disease. The symptoms are high fever, headache, muscular pain,
diarrhoea, failure to pass urine and massive haemorrhage with uncontrollable
bleeding from all body orifices. It is the first time that Ebola fever has
hit Uganda.
First news of the new outbreak came in an announcement by Ugandan Health
Minister Crispus Kiyonga on national radio and television on 14 Oct 2000.
Kiyonga described the symptoms of the disease and called on the public to
report all cases of persons seen to be manifesting them and to exercise
maximum care in handling the patients. He advised that all persons believed
to have died of the disease should be buried immediately and warned against
cultural practices such as the washing of bodies. By Tue 17 Oct 2000, Radio
Uganda was reporting 73 known cases, of whom 37 had died, and more are
continuing to arrive at hospitals in Gulu. Two of those who had died were
from the neighbouring district of Kitgum.
However, the acting Director of Emergency and Humanitarian Action at World
Health Organisation (WHO) headquarters in Geneva, Dr Yohana Larusdotte, told
IRIN on Tuesday that the Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Gulu had
actually started in August, but had only now reached crisis proportions. She
said the disease was now spreading and that officials from her organisation
in Kampala had begun distributing special safety equipment and protective
clothing to those directly dealing with the disease.
An international team of WHO experts has now reached Gulu and is helping the
government contain the disease and also trace the origin of the outbreak.
They were quoted by Monday's 'The East African' newspaper as saying they
suspected that the disease may have been brought in by Ugandan soldiers
returning home after serving in the DRC. This was denied by the Ugandan
Minister of State for Defence, Steven Kavuma, who was quoted as saying: "I
do not know of any soldier who has died of the disease." However, Saturday's
edition of the pro-government 'The New Vision' reported that the authorities
were investigating the recent death of a Congolese woman married to a
Ugandan soldier and brought by him to Gulu after serving with the Ugandan
army in the DRC. Meanwhile, neighbouring Kenya had been placed on an
official high alert, Tuesday's 'Daily Nation' reported. The paper quoted
Health Minister Sam Ongeri as telling a news conference on Monday that a
special team comprising health ministry officials and members of the WHO had
been set up to deal with any possible outbreak in the country. Officials had
already been rushed to key crossing points along the border with Uganda,
including ports on Lake Victoria, and an entire ward at the hospital in the
border town of Busia set aside for potential victims.
A WHO statement issued on Monday confirmed that the disease which had broken
out in northern Uganda was indeed Ebola fever and that the Organisation was
currently in Gulu "coordinating the international response to the crisis".

Concerning the Spread of Ebola hemorrhagic fever to to Kitgum
-------------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: Ministry of Health Officials yesterday said one of three student
nurses who died earlier from the disease in Gulu and was buried in Kitgum
could have carried the disease there. They said 2 new cases of the Ebola
haemorrhagic fever had occurred in Kitgum district bringing the number of
infections to 73 by yesterday. The 2 cases have been reported in St.
Joseph's Hospital.
Speaking at a press conference yesterday at the Ministry of Health
Headquarters in Kampala, Minister Dr. Crispus Kiyonga said the death toll in
Gulu was still at 35. He said health officials and epidemiologists are
trying to contain the disease and that the Ministry has budgeted Shs 500m to
spend on the exercise, but the sum could change. Several NGOs have also
offered to support government in curbing the disease, and had raised US$
400 000 (Shs 732m). They have also provided experts, protective wear and
vehicles. The World Health Organisation (WHO) is offering US$ 60 000 (Shs
110m) and 5 technical experts, 2 of whom are already in Gulu which is
the worst hit. World Vision has provided the ministry with ground staff,
UNICEF has donated a vehicle and US$ 60 000 (Shs 109.8m), MSF from France
has offered 8 technical assistants, protective wear and a vehicle, while
the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC), has donated protective
wear. The Department for International Development (DFID) donated US$
280 000 (Shs 512.4m) and CDC provided technical assistance.
The Minister rejected speculations that the disease could have been brought
by returning UPDF officers from DR Congo. He said the UPDF was in an area
more prone to Marburg, a virus similar to Ebola, but less deadly. "When
Marburg occurred, we checked every soldier who came back from Congo. If a
soldier was the cause, we would have informed you. There is no report of a
soldier who came back and died from the disease," Kiyonga said at the press
conference.

Ebola hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak; Background
---------------------------------------------
Gulu, 225 miles north of Kampala, is home to about 150 000 people, but is
surrounded by small villages with a largely illiterate population. A large
army base nearby defends against attacks by the rebel Lord's Resistance Army
and there is a nighttime curfew. Ebola has never been detected in Uganda
before, so few people recognize the disease or know how it is spread.
Okat Lokach, acting director of health services for Gulu district, said the
outbreak has so far been traced to a housewife who died around 7 Sep 2000.
She was buried according to local tradition, which involves the ritual
cleansing of the dead by family and friends. The next 2 victims were her
daughter and mother. Other mourners returned to their villages, fell ill and
infected their friends and family. It wasn't until 7 Oct 2000 that the first
case was seen in a hospital. But Lokach said the search for who infected the
housewife was still on, and the disease may have surfaced even earlier.
Experts from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control were expected to leave for
Uganda on Tuesday to investigate the outbreak and trace its origins.
Lt. Col. Walter Ochola, the chairman of Gulu district ordered all schools
closed on Tuesday and said funerals had been banned because the ritual
contributed to the spread of the disease. He said the district needs
disinfectant, disposable gloves and garments to help stem the spread of the
disease, as well as body bags so victims can be buried safely.
Ochola rejected speculation that the disease was brought to Uganda by
soldiers who had served in neighboring Congo, where it has been detected
before. He said no soldiers had contracted Ebola and denied earlier reports
that a Congolese woman married to a soldier had been diagnosed with the
disease.

Gulu; the Intersection of War and Disease
-----------------------------------------
GULU: In the remote north of Uganda, where men with guns come at night to
steal children, the Lacor Hospital had come to serve as a refuge. When
darkness approached, area residents gathered inside the hospital's tidy
compound and slept in the corridors to escape the Lord's Resistance Army, a
rebel group that has terrorized this neglected area for a more than a
decade. Thousands of people sought refuge so routinely that the hospital
staff called them "night dwellers." Now that the lethal Ebola fever has
emerged in Lacor, with 3 of the hospital's nurses among 35 known dead,
health officials are worried that the highly contagious virus may have leapt
from infected patients to those who slept in the corridors in the weeks
before doctors knew the disease was in their midst. "The worst-case scenario
is contamination in the last 2 weeks in Lacor among the night dwellers,"
said an aid worker. To date, doctors know of one such case, a local man "who
died across the road," said Matthew Lukwiya, Lacor's chief physician.
Ebola hemorrhagic fever is one of the deadliest human diseases, killing as
many as 90 percent of those infected, and its speed of transmission and
gruesome killing process inspire great fear. It essentially liquefies its
victims from within, breaking down the linings of their blood vessels and
organs and causing some to bleed from every orifice. Ebola, first identified
in 1976 in Congo (formerly Zaire) also has flared in Sudan, Gabon and Ivory
Coast, and killed 244 people in one eruption in Kikwit, Congo, in 1995.
While 71 cases have been counted officially in Gulu thus far, much illness
likely remains hidden in this region of few physicians and poor
communications.
As doctors rush from many countries to contain the disease, they also hope
to find clues to the virus's "reservoir"--the place where it exists when it
is not in the human body--and the way in which it "jumps" into the human
community. In Gulu, they are looking especially closely at Africa's latest
intersection of war and disease."This is the last place on Earth this should
happen, because people have been so traumatized for the last 16 years," said
Lukwiya, who was himself once abducted and held for 6 days by rebels
searching for medicines.
The same lack of order has framed a similar outbreak in neighboring Congo.
When men working an abandoned gold mine in the town of Durba began vomiting
blood and dying by the dozens in late 1998, a doctor named Bonzali Katanga
suspected either [infection by Ebola virus or its cousin, Marburg virus. As
the government's district health officer, Bonzali did his duty, even though
Congolese rebels, rather than any government, controlled his district. For
4 months, Bonzali tried to raise the alarm, in urgent radio reports to
his provincial superiors in Kisangani. But in Congo, where only 2 of 11
provincial health inspectors have even a working vehicle, the health system
has barely existed since the 1980s. Bonzali's superiors responded only when
he died. The investigators who finally arrived found a vial of his blood in
a refrigerator. The sample contained the Marburg virus, which Bonzali had
contracted treating miners on his own. The Marburg outbreak in Durba has
killed 69 of 103 people infected so far.
The ancient link between war and disease is strong in central Africa, where
aid agencies routinely battle cholera, measles and other contagions that
sweep through makeshift camps of families displaced by the region's
half-dozen wars. But Ebola fever brings a special urgency. Many thousands of
Ugandans live in camps around Gulu, driven from their rural homes by the
rebels. An official in Gulu reported 2 cases, and specialists say the
camps' poor sanitation and crowding could make any outbreak catastrophic.
Meanwhile, health officers struggle to determine how widely Ebola has spread
among the town's permanent residents. Relatives bringing patients to the
500-bed Lacor Hospital routinely report several other deaths at home that
have not been counted in the official statistics. Uganda's health ministry
has broadcast warnings on local radio since midweek, urging that the ill be
taken to the two local hospitals. Another was made Friday at a huge prayer
service convened for 12 people killed in rebel attacks on Gulu the previous
weekend. World Health Organization officials worry that efforts to arrest
the outbreak will be impeded by insecurity.
Health workers fear Ebola may be spreading by an unexpected means--funerals.
The first nursing student who died of Ebola is assumed to have caught it
from an unidentified patient. But Lukwiya said the two fellow students might
have been infected at her funeral. By long custom, funerals here are
intimate affairs. Mourners crowd into the small, mud-daubed huts in which
most people live, keeping vigil with the body until burial, usually the
following day. Before food is shared, the mourners eschew the custom of
washing and dip their unwashed hands into a common bowl. Officials said the
high ratio of female victims--more than 2 to 1--might be explained by the
traditional role women play in caring for the sick and preparing bodies for
burial.
Rumors continue here that Ebola arrived from Congo aboard a military
transport plane packed with returning soldiers. Scores of the Ugandan troops
now camp around Gulu arrived from the northeast corner of Congo, which
includes Durba, site of the Marburg outbreak near the gold mine. The rebel
group nominally in control of that area, the Rally for Congolese Democracy,
is supported by Uganda, which has soldiers stationed in Durba. Far from
shutting down the mine, witnesses say, the soldiers and rebels have been
charging admission to local men who want to try their luck.

[Rumour is rife in this region, especially with regard to the role of the
military in the spread of this disease. This report paints a bleak picture
of the appalling conditions which pertain in this region of Uganda and of
the difficulties which will confront those working to contain and eradicate
the outbreak.
A correspondent, Jade Minh Le <Binh-Minh.N.Le@uth.tmc.edu>, a returned Peace
Corps volunteer, who worked in Booue, Gabon, during the Ebola outbreak in
the winter of 1996 and early 1997 has sent some observations on
psychological and cultural factors that may promote spread of disease and
complicate its control. Among these are low levels of literacy, language
difficulties and cultural friction between affected groups and in-coming
helpers. The intervention of the local Nganga, or traditional healer, who
might have had physically contacted some of the victims. In Gabon, one
difficulty was convincing the families of the dead not to wash and clean out
the body as they were used to doing. In Booue, quarantines were regarded
poorly by the villagers, since the medical teams had tried to set up
blockades and cover windows with palm leaves, but the villagers associated
palm leaves with their funeral ceremonies. This information is passed in
the hope that it may have some value to someone. - Mod.CP
