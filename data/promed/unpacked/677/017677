7 people infected with Trichinella in Junin
-------------------------------------------
An "intra-family" outbreak of trichinosis occurred in the neighboring town of Junin de los Andes, which required the intervention of the authorities from Health Zone IV, who immediately strengthened preventive measures.

The Health Area Coordinator of Epidemiology, Fernanda Hada, confirmed this to the newspaper, revealing that the episode took place in a rural zone near to Junin de los Andes and affected 7 people, 4 of whom resided in that locality, and 3 others from elsewhere who shared food and were part of the same family group. It appears as though the boars were killed in the local fields.

Hadad warned of the risks of not conducting the analyses for trichinella by the corresponding animal health authorities, which can lead to situations as seen in Junin de los Andes. "Sometimes people think that cooking is enough to eliminate the parasite, but not enough," he said.

However, the Health official emphasized that "this is called a domestic [intra-family] outbreak, because it is limited to a specific group", and has nothing to do with the other situation that also occurred in Junin de los Andes years ago, when they discovered that a butcher was selling contaminated pork products.

In fact, trichinosis can be contracted not only by eating pork products, but also through other animals that transmit the disease through the consumption of foods made with raw or inadequately cooked meat that is contaminated with trichinella.

The disease presents a clinical picture of fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting, swelling of eyelids and itching. Symptoms can appear up to 45 days after ingestion. Institutions such as Food Science, SENASA or veterinary professionals can analyze a specimen of meat and confirm the presence of the parasite.

Three people from Ticino, near Villa Maria and 206 kms southeast of Cordoba were confirmed to have trichinosis.

According to the statement by the Hospital physician, the 3 affected individuals had eaten pork products locally that had not been kept in cold storage". The provincial Ministry of Health also issued an official statement about these cases mentioning that the municipality would implement hygienic and sanitary measure to avoid a larger outbreak.

Last week, when they had the 1st indications of an outbreak, the mayer of Ticino, Renato Lorenzatti, announced to the press that recommendations had been made to pork vendors that precautions were needed.

The Ministry of Health of Cordoba, through the Department of Epidemiology confirmed the outbreak in Ticino and issued an alert on the dangers of eating pork products of dubious origin and without a corresponding health inspection. According to investigations, at the moment, the only common link established was the consumption of salami or fresh sausages acquired in the same locality.

The investigation and pertinent control measures are being conducted jointly by professionals from the Department of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, the Food And Drug Control Secretariat of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, and SENASA with collaboration with the Municipality of Ticino.

[Infection with _trichinella_ is widespread in South America including Argentina. Pigs exposed to the environment may be infected by feeding kitchen waste or eating infected rodents. Pigs should be tested for _trichinella_ before used in local products either consumed within the family nor sold at markets.
