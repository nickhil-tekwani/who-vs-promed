On 22 Aug 2016 [today], a 16-year old female visited out-patient department of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) with a 2-month history of cough (dry), rash and shortness of breath, and thought that she had just a common cold. [For the past] week, she has been suffering from fever and red eyes. Her mother suspected scrub typhus because of the skin rash (she came to know through social networking) and requested her physician for laboratory confirmation. The patient was tested positive (ELISA method) for scrub typhus.

She was a resident of Hadigaun, Kathmandu, and had no history of traveling outside Kathmandu. Currently, information about scrub typhus is being widely disseminated throughout the country by Nepali media as well as the government of Nepal.

Usually, the illness begins suddenly with shaking chills, fever, red eyes and swelling of the lymph nodes. However, atypical clinical presentation such as late appearance of fever and early development of a skin rash (before fever), as seen in this patient, may lead to misdiagnosis and serious complications. This unique clinical presentation warrants further study to give better understanding of the disease.
