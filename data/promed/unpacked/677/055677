--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We report 2 cases of Ross River virus (RRV) infection in Dutch travellers who visited Australia during February to April 2015. These cases coincided with the largest recorded outbreak of RRV disease in Australia since 1996. This report serves to create awareness among physicians to consider travel-related RRV disease in differential diagnosis of patients with fever, arthralgia and/or rash returning from the South Pacific area, and to promote awareness among professionals advising travellers to this region.

Background
----------
RRV, an alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes, is endemic in Australia and Papua New Guinea, with occasional epidemics in island countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and marsupials, such as kangaroos and wallabies, as primary reservoirs. Rodents, rabbits, fruit bats, possums, horses, cats and dogs have been implicated as well. Human-to-human transmission has been described in epidemic situations, and viraemic travellers from Australia have been linked to epidemics in the Cook Islands, Fiji, New Caledonia and Samoa. Unnoticed circulation of RRV has been described in French Polynesia. Recent evidence supports RRV transmission through blood donation. Mosquitoes belonging to the genera _Aedes_ and _Culex_ are considered the main vector species and vertical transmission has been described as a way for the virus to persist during adverse conditions in desiccation-resistant eggs.

RRV is endemic in tropical and subtropical Australia (Northern Territory and Queensland) with year-round notification of human cases, while in temperate Australia (New South Wales and Victoria) human cases occur seasonally and in epidemics. According to the Australian Department of Health, by 23 Jun 2015, a total of 7552 RRV disease cases had been reported this year [2015], which is the largest number of annual reported cases since 1996. Most cases up to 23 Jun [2015] were reported in Queensland (n = 5075) and New-South Wales (n = 1292) and peak incidences were in February to April.

The incubation period for RRV disease (also called epidemic polyarthritis) is typically 7-9 days, ranging from 3 to 21 days. In 55-75 per cent of infections, the individuals are asymptomatic. Symptomatic disease typically includes arthralgia, myalgia and fatigue.

Low-grade fever (37.5-38.5 deg C) and maculopapular rash on the torso and limbs (sometimes palms, soles and face) occur in 50-60 per cent of clinical cases. Joint pain, stiffness and swelling are usually symmetrical, affecting wrists, hands, fingers, ankles and knees. Additional manifestations may include headache, diarrhoea and nausea. Symptoms most often resolve within 3-6 months; permanent sequelae have not been described.

Discussion
----------
The cases presented here highlight the importance of considering RRV in differential diagnosis for travellers presenting with acute arthritis returning from Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. The 2 cases we describe were related to travel to risk areas in Australia in February/March and March-May 2015.

Although RRV-viraemic travellers have been linked to the spread and epidemics with RRV in the Asia-Pacific region, it is highly unlikely that return of viraemic travellers to Europe will result in autochthonous transmission. As the duration of viraemia is short, the likelihood that a traveller will be viraemic on their return is small. More importantly, the 3 main vectors for RRV transmission based on field isolations and competence studies are either strictly confined to Australia (_Aedes vigilax_ and _Ae. camptorhynchus_, both invasive but not established in New Zealand) or the Asia-Pacific region (_Culex annulirostri_).

[This is yet another example of long-distance movement of pathogens by travelers. It underscores the importance of good travel histories to assist clinicians in arriving at a list of possible pathogens for diagnoses. Fortunately, in the above cases there is little probability of ongoing transmission due to the reasons given in the report. Apparently, the infections were acquired in Australia in northern Queensland and New South Wales states.
