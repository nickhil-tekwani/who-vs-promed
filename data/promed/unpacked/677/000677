Swedish scientists say they're puzzled by a mysterious illness plaguing an elk population in Sweden that has left many animals dead or dying. 14 adult elk around Blekinge in southern Sweden have recently been found in the woods in severe states of paralysis, emaciation, and blindness, TT/TheLocal.se reported on Friday [10 Aug 2012].

The blindness has resulted in some elk being killed in traffic accidents, but experts say they have no clue as to what is causing the signs.

"There is no scientific explanation," Lennart Balk of Stockholm University told the Aftonbladet newspaper. Balk pointed to the tens of thousands of wild birds that have also died in the area from a lack of thiamine, or vitamin B1, as a possible link. "We see that the elk are affected with the same clinical signs, but it is too early to say whether it's the same disease," he said.

Viral and parasitic infections and possible contaminants in the environment have been ruled out, scientists said. "It's a mystery. These are animals that are in good condition," Torsten Morner of the National Veterinary Institute said. "They are confused, and the one bull we had in was emaciated. We don't know what's causing it." It's strange that something would stop an elk from eating over the summer, he said.

[In the text, there is a contradiction about the condition of the diseased elk. It is stated that the animals are in good condition in one paragraph, but they also say that elk are emaciated twice elsewhere.

Parasites that may cause neurological signs and/or blindness are _Elaphostrongylus cervi_ and _Elaeophora schneideri_, nematodes that invade the central nervous system of a variety of cervids. Malignant catarrhal fever is a viral disease of many wild ruminant species that may result in blindness. Vitamin A deficiency causes night blindness; B12 deficiency is associated with neurological disorders, but here the case seems to be something else.
