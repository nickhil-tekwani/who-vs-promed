According to the Department of the Federal Service on Supervision of Protection of Consumer Rights and Human Well-Being in St. Petersburg, 102 cases of psittacosis in humans have been registered within the past year.

Over the past 10 years, [the incidence of this disease] has increased 6 times, primarily among personnel of pet stores in the city. The city veterinary service reports that pet birds purchased by citizens may have been carriers in 29 such cases identified in 2012.

Check-ups on the conditions in which animals and birds are being kept have been carried out, and it has been established that birds were obtained without accompanying documents at the Polustrovsky market. Investigation is being carried out to identify violations.

An unscheduled audit of the Biosfera pet store network revealed cases among birds carrying psittacosis, which had been sold. The violators have been charged, and it is planned to hold an extraordinary joint session of the Emergency Sanitary-Epidemiological Commission and Anti-Epizootic Commission of the Government of St. Petersburg to prevent the spread of psittacosis.

[_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians.

Historically (http://animal-health.library4farming.org/Animal-Swine-Rabbits/diseases-and-parasites-affecting-poultry/Ornithosis-and-Psittacosis.html), the 1st description of a disease marked by an atypical pneumonia was reported in 1879 among persons having contact with sick parrots. A severe and sometimes fatal atypical pneumonia was observed in various European countries and the USA in later years. An unusually severe epidemic occurred in Paris in 1892. The name psittacosis was suggested for the disease in 1895.

An epidemic involving more than 100 cases of atypical pneumonia, diagnosed as psittacosis, occurred in Argentina in 1929. A year later, outbreaks in Europe and the USA were traced to parrots newly imported from South America. - Mod.LL
