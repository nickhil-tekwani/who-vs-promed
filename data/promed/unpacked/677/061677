The specialists of Dagestan Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Sanitary
Service] report that 28 cases of botulism have been registered in the
region since January 2008. During the last 5 years, about 100
botulism cases have been registered, with 166 people involved and 3 fatalities.

canned goods, smoked fish and products in hermetic wrapping of
unknown origin with no certificate of quality.

rather because the rural population heavily relies on this kind of
food, especially during the wintertime. - Mod.NP]
