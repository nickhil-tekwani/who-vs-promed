Cane smut crosses Queensland border
-----------------------------------
Experts say Clarence Valley [near Grafton] sugarcane farmers should
not panic over the discovery of sugarcane smut spores in northern New
South Wales. NSW Canegrowers Association president and 3rd generation
Palmers Island grower Vince Castle said most farmers in the area were
prepared for the news. "We've known for at least 2 years it would
come here," he said. "We had hoped to get 2 to 3 years beyond this,
but we have preparations in place."

Sugarcane smut is an infectious fungal disease, which can reduce
sugar yields by 30 to 100 percent. The disease can be identified by a
black, whip-like structure that forms from the growing point of the
sugarcane plant and contains tiny spores that spread in the air to
infect other plants.

Earlier this month [April 2008], NSW Sugar and industry research
agency BSES [Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations] confirmed smut
spores were found in an air sampling trap near Tweed Heads in
December [2007]. NSW Sugar chief executive officer Greg Messiter said
although the spores were not causing disease [at present], the
discovery showed spores were moving south in wind currents.

Woodford Island grower Alan Munro said local farmers were lucky a
smut-resistant type of cane BN1394 was already widely used in the
Clarence Valley. "There are also a couple of medium resistant
varieties, and 4 [more] varieties of resistant seed [cane] were
released commercially last year [2007]," he said. Because of the
varieties available in NSW, Mr Castle said if smut struck in the
Valley, it was unlikely to have the same devastating impact
experienced in Queensland. "We're confident 50 percent of the cane in
NSW is safe, the risk is the other 50 percent ... now the spores have
been found, we have less leeway than we thought." He said that any
farmer who didn't heed the warning 2 years ago would be looking at a
costly replanting operation.

NSW Sugar CEO Greg Messiter has urged farmers to be on the lookout
for smut symptoms.

[Sugarcane smut is caused by the fungus _Sporisorium scitamineum_. It
is highly contagious and can be spread by wind or carried on clothing
and machinery. Symptoms are a black whip-like structure emerging from
the central core of meristematic tissues. The whip contains spores
covered with a thin membrane, which ruptures easily to release the
spores. Smut spores survive for long periods in soil or plant debris.
Disease management may include removal of inoculum, burning of
infected cane fields, fungicides, and use of clean planting material.
However, smut control is best achieved by using resistant cane
cultivars available for different regions.

Australia was the last cane growing country worldwide considered to
be free of smut until the disease was found in 1998 in Western
Australia, a minor cane growing area, and in June 2006 in Queensland.
In less than 2 years it had spread to all the main sugar growing
regions of Queensland, despite efforts to contain the disease, and
has now entered NSW. Management and monitoring programmes have been
implemented, and a programme of replacing susceptible with smut
resistant varieties is in progress.

Smut monitoring is done by spore traps and indicator plots of
susceptible varieties. A spore trap is essentially a sticky slide
that is transported past an orifice through which air is drawn. The
slide passes by the orifice via a transport device and so spores,
which hit the slide as the air changes direction, are attached to the
slide. Spores are identified by morphology to genus and sometimes
species. Spore traps are used for determining identity and time of
dispersal of fungi. Spores found in traps can indicate the presence
of a fungal pathogen before disease is discovered in the field
because symptoms need time to develop and may initially be difficult
to detect.
