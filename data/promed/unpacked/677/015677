Tunisia's Criminal Court on terrorism cases in the capital's Court of Appeal has sentenced 31 people to death over the 2014 terrorist attack on the house of former Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou. Among the 31 suspects are Seifallah Ben Hassine, known as Abu Ayyad, an associate of late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden and founder of the militant group Ansar al-Sharia. He is also the main suspect in a series of terrorist acts, including the assassination of Tunisian leftist Chokri Belaid and MP Mohamed el-Brahmi. The 31 suspects, who include Algerians as well as Tunisians, were sentenced in absentia. Some of them are reportedly dead.

Algerian Khalid al-Shayeb, known as Luqman Abu Sakhr, was among them. He was allegedly killed in 2015 during armed clashes in the Gafsa region of southwestern Tunisia.

The court also sentenced one defendant to 3 years in prison and 7 others to 10 years, while a number of other suspects received 20-year or life sentences. In addition, the Tunisian judiciary acquitted 7 defendants of terrorism charges.

In May 2014, a terrorist group attacked Ben Jeddou's house in Kasserine, killing 4 Tunisian security agents and injuring several others.

In other news, 19 letters [sic, 20] containing potentially deadly toxins addressed to prominent journalists, politicians, and trade unionists have been intercepted by police at the central post office in Tunis and taken for testing. The National Unit of Investigation for Terrorist Affairs and Organized Crime revealed that the toxic substance was made in Tunisia inside a laboratory.

The Ministry of Interior indicated that it is monitoring the movements of the terrorist cells that plotted the attack, especially [given] that the deadly poison was made with local Tunisian expertise and required huge financial support.

[Tunisia is a small country, and any laboratory is probably government funded and staffed. Also, the basic microbiologic culturing of _B. anthracis_ is not that complicated, whatever the Tunisian claims. Without wanting to go into details of what might or might not be involved in these letter contents, the coincident timing of the letter mailings with the public sentencing of the 31 terrorists and other suspects would rally public support of their government, both in the present situation and down the road. - Mod.MHJ
