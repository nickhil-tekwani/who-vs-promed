Mango production in Rajshahi and Chapainawabganj districts [of Rajshahi division] may be hampered by unfavourable weather this year [2015]. This follows the earlier attack by leaf hoppers which had caused many green mangoes to fall before ripening properly.

"Mango production will not be satisfactory in my area as almost 70 per cent of the fruits fell from the trees before ripening," said a farmer. "We are cursed with Moha this year [2015]," he said.

Horticulturists explained that Moha is a kind of disease that appears in the form of mould on leaves. It happens especially when the mist shrouds the nature during summer nights. They said adequate rainfall could save mango trees from this kind of diseases. The mango growers are worried as the number of trees bearing fruits is inadequate.

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide. A number of fungal diseases affecting the crop have been reported in the region, including anthracnose, mildews, leaf and stem blights, diebacks, and root rots.

From the symptoms of "mould on leaves" described above, the problem may be due to powdery mildew (_Oidium mangiferae_). An outbreak of mango powdery mildew was reported from Rajshahi in 2009 (ProMED-mail post 20090614.2207). However, reliable pathogen diagnosis is required before effective management strategies can be devised to combat the problem.

Powdery mildew is one of the most serious diseases of the crop, affecting almost all varieties to varying degrees with yield losses of up to 80 per cent on individual trees. Symptoms may include white "powdery" growth mostly on inflorescences, but also on young leaves, leading to premature drop of flowers, leaves, and young fruit. The disease is favoured by cool, dry weather. Spores are dispersed by wind, water, or mechanical means. Between seasons, the pathogen survives on infected plant parts and debris such as fallen leaves. Disease management includes fungicides and cultural practices.
