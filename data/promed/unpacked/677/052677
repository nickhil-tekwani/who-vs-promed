On [23, 20 and 17 Apr 2014], the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 6 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

Details of the cases reported on [23 Apr 2014] are as follows:
- A 35-year-old health-care worker from Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. She became ill on [10 Apr 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [14 Apr 2014] and is currently in a critical condition.
- A 50-year-old man from Yongzhou City, Hunan province. He became ill on [10 Apr 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [19 Apr 2014] and is currently in a critical condition.

Details of the cases as reported on [21 Apr 2014] are as follows:
- A 34-year-old man from Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province. He became ill on [10 Apr 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [16 Apr 2014], and is currently in a critical condition.
- A 55-year-old woman from Shantou City, Guangdong Province. She became ill on [6 Apr 2014], was admitted to a local hospital on [17 Apr 2014], and is currently in a critical condition.

Details of the cases notified on [17 Apr 2014] are as follows:
- A 60-year-old man from Changzhou City, Jiangsu Province. He became ill on [8 Apr 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [13 Apr 2014], and is currently in a severe condition. He had a history of contact with poultry before he became ill.
- A 70-year-old man from Tongling City, Anhui Province. He became ill on [21 Mar 2014], was admitted to a hospital on [25 Mar 2014], and died on [14 Apr 2014].

The Chinese Government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment; and
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information.

The overall risk assessment has not changed (see WHO Risk Assessment under "Related links").

The previous report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus detection in live poultry exported from mainland China to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through movement of live poultry; at this time, there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred. However, as the virus infection does not cause signs of disease in poultry, continued surveillance is needed.

Further sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas.

Should human cases from affected areas travel internationally, their infection may be detected in another country during or after arrival. If this were to occur, community level spread is unlikely as the virus does not have the ability to transmit easily among humans. Until the virus adapts itself for efficient human-to-human transmission, the risk of ongoing international spread of H7N9 virus by travellers is low.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms, or contact with animals in live bird markets, or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns, in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005), and continue national health preparedness actions.

[Additional information from a media report on this case (Focus Taiwan: http://focustaiwan.tw/news/asoc/201404220045.aspx):
"The patient, a 44-year-old woman from China's Jiangsu Province, entered Taiwan on [17 Apr 2014] as part of a tour group. She is currently in serious condition in a hospital intensive care unit. The woman had a dry cough and muscle soreness when she arrived in Taiwan and went to a clinic in New Taipei for treatment that day [17 Apr 2014]. On [18 Apr 2014], she developed nausea and fever and sought treatment at a hospital the following day, where an X-ray showed that she had pneumonia and pleural effusion. On [20 Apr 2014], she was taken to a medical center accompanied by her tour group leader and was given Tamiflu. The medical center then notified the CDC of a suspected H7N9 avian flu case. The CDC has informed the World Health Organization of the latest case that is being treated in Taiwan.

"Chuang Jen-hsiang, deputy CDC director-general, said that the patient had purchased chicken slaughtered at a traditional market in Nanjing before coming to Taiwan.

"Family members of the woman, who has a history of diabetes, have traveled to Taiwan to take care of her. Chuang said that 61 people are known to have had contact with the woman, including the 34-member tour group. None of them have so far developed symptoms. Other members of the group have continued their planned itinerary in Taiwan and are scheduled to depart on [24 Apr 2014]."

Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Friday [25 Apr 2014] the island's 4th imported case of H7N9 avian flu since April last year [2013].

The patient, a 39-year-old Taiwanese businessman, developed symptoms similar to that of H7N9 when he entered Taiwan on [19 Apr 2014], after traveling to Beijing and Kunshan in eastern China. X-ray test results on [23 Apr 2014] showed that he had pulmonary infiltration. He was then sent to a hospital for intensive care, the CDC said. The case was confirmed to be H7N9 at 6 p.m. Friday [25 Apr 2014]

Initial investigation found that the patient had neither contact with birds nor had visited markets where live poultry was sold when he was in China, according to the CDC.

People who have had close contact with the patient, including 3 family members and one colleague, did not develop suspicious symptoms, the CDC said. CDC officials said they are also keeping track of a total of 57 medical personnel who have come in contact with the patient, as well as 8 passengers who were on the same flight with him.

The CDC is currently in the process of reporting the case to the World Health Organization.

Friday's [25 Apr 2014] case was the 2nd H7N9 patient identified in Taiwan this week. A 44-year-old tourist from China's Jiangsu Province was found to be infected with the disease on Tuesday [22 Apr 2014].

Taiwan confirmed its 1st and 2nd imported H7N9 cases from China on [24 Apr 2013 and 31 Dec 2013], respectively.

Since [3 Apr 2013], a total of 581 suspected H7N9 cases have been reported in Taiwan, but only 4 have been confirmed, with the December [2013] case proving fatal. All the other cases tested negative.

[Since the last ProMED update on the avian influenza A(H7N9) situation in China, there have been a total of 9 newly diagnosed cases of infection related to exposure on mainland China. Noteworthy is that of the 7 new cases reported by WHO, only one mentions that there was a prior history of exposure to live poultry (note that a media report on another case did mention that the case had purchased and slaughtered a live chicken in Jiangsu prior to onset of symptoms). Are these new cases from person-to-person contact, or was there live poultry exposure that wasn't mentioned by the patient or family members upon questioning or not reported to official channels?

Overall, it appears as though transmission may be slowing down. It also appears as though transmission has significantly slowed down in Zhejiang and Guangdong, the 2 provinces with previously the highest numbers of cases, but it may be picking up in Jiangsu (5 of the 9 newly reported cases had exposure in Jiangsu.
