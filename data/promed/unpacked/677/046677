A farmer raising livestock in Huaraz, Ancash (north-central Peru, a main agricultural center) is in serious condition after an outbreak of anthrax. This is the 2nd case reported in the area and was confirmed by the Head of Epidemiology, Regional Health Authority, Jaime Salazar.

This case involves a rancher (livestock breeder) in Huaraz who is in critical condition at the Hospital Guard Victor Ramos, said the authorities. The 60-year-old man presented himself a few days ago with a wound on his right leg that gradually began to spread to other parts of the body; he also had a high fever. Currently, he has been admitted to an isolation room and is being attended to by medical staff who have undergone biosecurity measures [These people do not understand that anthrax is not infectious; the staff looking after this patient are in no danger. - Mods.SB/MHJ].

The doctor, Ricardo Natividad, in charge of Epidemiology at Huaraz, said that an investigation is underway as to the mode of transmission, but it is likely to have been by contact with infected animals.

Reliable sources in the Huaracino hospital last June [2013?] reported an anthrax fatality whose case was kept in reserve. [Not quite sure what they mean by this; was it not reported? - Mod.MHJ], so it is suspected that there may be other cases.

[The disease has long been a problem, mainly in the coastal provinces such as Callao, Lambayeque, Moquegua, Tumbes, La Libertad, Ancash, Lima, Ica, and Cajamarca, Huanuco, and Cerro de Pasco. Anthrax is infrequently reported in Peruvian sheep and goats and not at all in llamas and alpacas. However, Huaraz is well inland, tucked into the Andes; see: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PE/02/Huaraz.html.

Human cutaneous lesions are most commonly on the hands and forearms, reflecting occupational exposure. How one's leg might develop a lesion is not immediately obvious, but the pathogen's entry is always via a break or cut in the skin. It is not unknown for a cutaneous lesion to follow upon scratching an itch with bloody fingers.

At this point, the source of this man's infection has yet to be revealed. The problem with anthrax in sheep and goats is that their deaths are not usually a cause for concern. I have known of an ovine outbreak in South Africa that only got reported when some 50 ewes had died. It is not unusual for shepherds to automatically skin any dead sheep so that the hide and fleece can be later sold; you will see these hides slung over a fence to dry out and be recovered when they are dry and he has the time to pick them up. - Mod.MHJ
