13 alpacas were culled and destroyed by the Beijing Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau [CIQ] after being diagnosed with Elisa-type Q fever. This is the 1st time that China has ever identified Q fever from imported alpacas.

Alpacas have become popular among people in China in recent years. These 13 alpacas from Chile were diagnosed with Q fever after taking blood in a routine examination during isolation.

There have been some reports about a booming business of alpaca purchased overseas. The CIQ has stressed that all imported alpacas should be isolated for 30 to 45 days and quarantined at the port-of-entry.

According to medical information, Q fever is a disease caused by infection with _Coxiella burnetii_, a bacterium that infects humans and other animals. Zhang Shaoping, an official at CIQ, said humans as well as cattle, sheep, goats and other domestic mammals, including cats and dogs, are generally susceptible to Q fever. The infection results from inhalation of infectious aerosols, polluted dirt, and drinking contaminated milk or polluted water. Q fever has a high rate of infection among animals.

[Query (Q) fever (or coxiellosis), one of OIE's listed diseases, is a zoonosis that occurs in most countries. Humans generally acquire infection through airborne transmission from animal reservoirs, especially from domestic ruminants, but other domestic and wildlife animals (pets, rabbits, birds, etc.) can be involved. It is included among OIE's list of "New World camelids" diseases within "Group II", namely "Diseases for which camelids are potential pathogen carriers".

The causal agent is the obligate intracellular bacterium, _Coxiella burnetii_, which displays different morphological forms in its developmental cycle. Some forms can survive extracellularly and even accumulate in the environment. Because this microorganism is classified as a Group 3 pathogen, handling viable _C. burnetii_ must be done in biosafety level 3 facilities.

China reported to the OIE in its annual reports (the last one covering 2013) that Q fever is one of the diseases "for which no information has been provided." The disease seems not to be notifiable in China (confirmation requested). According to a recent paper, "serological investigations indicate that Q fever is present nationwide in China." See at http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0002231.

In Chile, Q fever is a notifiable animal disease. According to the 2013 annual report to the OIE, the disease in Chile was last recorded in animals in 2007.

It would be interesting to note whether the veterinary certificate issued by China to permit the import of the alpacas from Chile included a requirement for Q fever testing prior to their export and to exclude the possibility of a later time of infection. Q fever in the alpacas could have had a subclinical course. - Mod.AS
