[The location of the outbreak is indicated in the appended map (at the source URL above). A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Belarus can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/7ozo.

The immediate OIE notification above on the 1st ASF outbreak in Belarus, reaffirming the information from external sources (Russia, Ukraine) included in ProMED-mail posting 20130623.1787833, presents 2 epidemiological data which deserve attention:

1. The size of the affected population: 16 susceptible animals -- a relatively small unit. A backyard holding?
2. The source of infection: reportedly, "feed". Does this refer to a sporadic incident (such as a local kitchen's leftover/sandwich from abroad) or rather commercially imported swill, which may have been shared by other holdings? In both cases, where did it come from?

Details on the said points will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
