Britain's Veterinary Laboratories Agency have confirmed that a cow in
Chiba Prefecture in Japan was the first such animal in Asia to have
been struck by the disease, Japanese government officials said Sat 22
Sep 2001.
"We have concluded that the cow was indeed infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy." Dr Shigeo Miyajima, Director of Animal
Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.
The news conference was called after neuropathologists at Britain's
Veterinary Laboratories Agency, who had studied brain samples removed
from the Chiba cow, delivered their conclusion late Friday night. The
same brain sample had been already sent to the National Institute of
Animal Health (NIAH, Japan) on 6 Sep 2001 for histopathological
examination with the same result, and also subjected to
immuno-histochemical examination with a positive result on 10 Sep 200.

[The question now is how this relatively young animal became
"infected" with these prions. Considering the international
implications this investigation will require skills of a high order. -
