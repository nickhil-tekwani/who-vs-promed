Health authorities in the Northern Region have confirmed a new case of
yellow fever [YF] in the region. This follows laboratory findings that
attributed the death of a 16-year-old-boy from Dikatami in the
Sawla-Tuna-Kalba District to yellow fever [virus] infection.
Consequently, district and regional health facilities in the region
have been put on high alert to identify and manage effectively any
case of yellow fever.

Briefing the Daily Graphic, the Deputy Regional Director in Charge of
Public Health, Dr Jacob Mahama, said on 20 Aug 2011, the boy reported
at a clinic in the Sawla District with complaints of fever, chills,
vomiting and abdominal pains. He said after examinations, he was
referred to the Wa Hospital in the Upper West Region, where he died
the next day. "However, the blood sample of the patient was sent to
Accra and later to Dakar, Senegal, in September 2011, where it was
found to be positive for yellow fever," he noted.

Dr Mahama said following the confirmation of the yellow fever case, a
team from the Regional Health Directorate was dispatched to Sawla. The
team, he said, undertook a search for other cases, by reviewing the
records in all the facilities. He said the team found no other cases,
but sensitised the health staff in the district and the community
people on yellow fever, its symptoms and causes.

Dr Mahama said the World Health Organisation (WHO) had recommended
that there should be a reactive vaccination in various parts of the
country to prevent the spread of the disease. He said, in the Northern
Region, the vaccination would take place in 6 districts that have been
considered as high risk due to their proximity to Wa and Cote
d'Ivoire, where there has been an outbreak of yellow fever. The
districts are the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba, Bole, Central Gonja, West Gonja,
East Gonja and West Mamprusi. He said already the region had received
the vaccines and had distributed them to the districts, pending the
commencement of the vaccination exercise from 22 - 28 Nov 2011.

Yellow fever, as explained by Dr Mahama, is an acute viral fever with
symptoms that include fever, chills, vomiting and jaundice.

It is a disease prevalent in tropical Africa and South America,
because the _Aedes_ mosquito which transmits this virus breeds in the
tropics.

Of patients who suffer from severe yellow fever, 20-30 per cent lose
their lives.

The best ways to avoid yellow fever is through vaccination and by
avoiding the bite of a mosquito.

[Unfortunately, it has taken 3 months to make the YF diagnosis, with
the risk of additional cases occurring during that time that could
have led to an outbreak. Fortunately, apparently no new cases have
occurred. It seems unusual that this report does not mention the 3
cases that occurred this year (2011) in the in Wa Municipality, Jirapa
and Wa East Districts of the Upper West Region (see ProMED-mail
archive number 20111112.3357). These isolated cases are probably due
to spill-over transmission from the sylvan (jungle or forest) YF virus
transmission cycle that involves wild primates.

The 17 Nov 2011 edition of Spy Ghana
(http://www.spyghana.com/health/health-news/30000-die-from-yellow-fever/)
quoted the Deputy Director in charge of surveillance at the Ashanti
Regional Health Services Directorate, Dr Asiedu Bekoe, who said a mass
YF vaccination exercise scheduled to kick start in 57 districts from
22-28 Nov 2011 was vital because 3 yellow fever cases [probably those
reported in ProMED-mail archive number 20111112.3357] have been
confirmed in some districts this year. Dr. Bekoe revealed that 17
districts in the Ashanti region would be covered for the exercise but
for the 1st phase, 3 districts namely Kumasi, Adansi South and Atwima
Mponua would be covered. Noting that the other 14 districts would have
their turn somewhere July next year [2012], Dr Bekoe said his unit was
targeting 1 325 201 in the 3 districts selected for the 1st phase.

The Ashanti Region is located in the south-central part of Ghana,
relatively far away from the locations where this year's (2011) YF
cases occurred. A map showing the administrative regions of Ghana can

The Sawla-Tuna-Kalba District is one of the 18 districts in the
Northern Region of Ghana. Its capital is Sawla. A
