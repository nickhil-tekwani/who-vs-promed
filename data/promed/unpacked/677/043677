In the wake of the death of a 20-year-old resident of a rural community south of this city [San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora state], health officials are waiting for test results to determine if she was the victim of a bacterium borne by ticks.

In the meantime, 35 homes in and around Estacion Riito have been sprayed for ticks, and authorities have launched information in the community of a little more than 1000 residents in hopes of avoiding an outbreak of disease stemming from the _Rickettsia_ bacterium.

[The woman], 20, died [19 Aug 2013], and authorities are concerned that her death could be an indication the tick-borne bacterium could be spreading from nearby Mexicali, Baja California, where more than 20 people have been victimized by rickettsial diseases over the past 2 years.

_Rickettsia_ can be transmitted to humans through a bite from a tick, and disease specialists at the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) believe that might have been a factor in the death of the woman at a public health clinic in Mexicali, where she had been under care after her condition worsened earlier this month [August 2013].

Abel Sanchez, municipal medical services director for the city of San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, said Mexico's Secretariat of Health is examining blood and other samples from the victim to corroborate the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, and to determine if ticks were the cause.

"You can't question the diagnosis of UABC," said Sanchez, "because they have the most important research center for _Rickettsia_ in northwest Mexico. They are looking into the conditions under which the person became ill, and whether a tick transmitted it."

Spraying began last week in Riito, a rural community about 10 miles south of San Luis Rio Colorado, and some of the ticks found in homes there were sent to Mexicali to determine if they carried the bacterium, Sanchez said.

"In lots of areas there are problems with ticks, and this is the time when they come out," said Sanchez. He added that the spraying is independent of any other measures that may be ordered by the Secretariat of Health in the event tests done in Mexicali determine that _Rickettsia_ was the cause of the woman's death or that ticks sent from Riito carried the bacterium.

Part of the reason authorities suspect _Rickettsia_ in [the woman's] death is Riito's proximity to the Mexicali Valley, where more than 100 people have been infected by the bacterium over the past 2 years, many of them in the impoverished rural areas outside the city. [The woman] commuted daily to the Mexicali Valley for her studies, according to Sonora health officials, and in February [2013] a Mexicali resident died from rickettsial disease in Luis B. Sanchez, a community a few miles west of Riito.

Sanchez said the problem can easily be prevented by residents. "The problem is there, in part, because we don't do what is everyone's responsibility, cleanliness of pets and cleanliness in the home," he said. "It's the government's responsibility to keep the streets and other public places clean. But what happens inside one's property is the obligation of the individual. Having a clean yard, a clean pet, a sprayed and disinfected house is part of the obligation of the resident."

[The woman's] parents told news media in San Luis Rio Colorado that their daughter had told them prior to her death that she had been bitten by a tick, but that the family did not realize that her worsening condition could be related to the bite.

Sanchez said symptoms from _Rickettsia_ are similar to those of other illnesses. "The good thing is that the illness is curable if it is dealt with in time, but the bad thing is that the symptoms can be confused with other diseases."

[Because of the known problem with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico, the news report above is likely referring to RMSF, a tick-borne disease caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_.

The incubation period for RMSF is about a week after the tick exposure, days after the tick has detached. Frequently the patient is unaware of a preceding tick bite and the presenting illness is nonspecific, often leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. The case fatality ratio for RMSF approaches 25 per cent if untreated. Typical symptoms include: fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, and muscle pain. A rash, which may also develop in more than 50 per cent of cases after the onset of fever, is small, flat, pink, non-itchy macules on the wrists, forearms, and ankles and spreads to include the trunk and sometimes the palms and soles (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html#rash); but is often absent in the 1st few days, and in some patients, never develops ("spotless fever"). Pictures of the rash of this disease can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/symptoms/index.html#rash.

The red to purple, spotted (petechial) rash of RMSF is usually not seen until the 6th day or later after onset of symptoms and occurs in 35-60 per cent of patients with the infection. This is a sign of progression to severe disease, and every attempt should be made to begin treatment before petechiae develop. Thus empiric treatment should be started in patients with a compatible illness who have a history of possible tick exposure, even if there is no knowledge of a preceding tick bite. Doxycycline is the 1st line treatment for adults and children of all ages, and is most effective if started before the 5th day of symptoms.

The primary ticks that transmit _R. rickettsii_ in the United States include the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_), Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_), and brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/). A female _Dermacentor variabilis_ (the American dog tick) can be seen at http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5504a1.htm#fig1. _R. rickettsii_ is passed transovarially from adult females to their progeny (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0014489463900195).

In 2003, investigators in Mexicali, Mexico were reported to have conducted an entomologic survey to determine the prevalence of the brown dog tick _R. sanguineus_ among 94 stray and privately owned dogs in the city and determined that 60 per cent of these animals were infested with _R. sanguineus_, a prevalence far greater than reported in other areas of Mexico and other parts of the world (Paddock CD, Telford SR III. Through a glass, darkly: The global incidence of tick-borne diseases. Available at: http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Disease/TickBorne/01-Global-Incidence-of-Tick-borne-disease.pdf).

Subsequently, a large urban outbreak of RMSF that involved over 1000 cases occurred in Mexicali, Mexico in 2009. The Mexicali outbreak was linked to transmission by the brown dog tick, and spread through infected ticks by stray and free-roaming dogs. In 2009, surveys for _R. sanguineus_ identified these ticks in all 14 districts of Mexicali, where 96 per cent of the cases occurred (http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Disease/TickBorne/01-Global-Incidence-of-Tick-borne-disease.pdf).

RMSF has also been reported along the US side of the border. During 2010, Arizona reported 41 cases associated with tribal lands, transmitted by the brown dog tick _R. sanguineus_ and also involved roaming dogs and heavy infestations of brown dog ticks that resulted in peri-domestic transmission and clustering of cases (Buelow ML. The epidemiology of rickettsial diseases on the US Mexico border: An analysis of incidence rates, clinical presentation and risk factors associated with _Rickettsia rickettsii_, _Rickettsia typhi_ and _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ infection. Available at: https://etd.library.emory.edu/view/record/pid/emory:92fnd).

The Mexican _R. rickettsii_ have been reported to differ genetically from isolates in other endemic regions of northern, central, and southern Americas; _Rhipicephalus_ ticks in Mexicali are also said to differ genetically from _R. sanguineus_ found in the United States (Eremeeva ME, Zambrano ML Anaya L, et al. Circulation of a unique genetic type of _Rickettsia rickettsii_ in ticks of the _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_ complex was detected in Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico. 1 Mar 2011. Abstract available at: http://worldwidescience.org/topicpages/r/rickettsia+rickettsii+identification.html.

San Luis Rio Colorado, with a population of 159 089 in 2005, is a city in the northwestern corner of the Mexican state of Sonora on the border with the Mexican state of Baja California; San Luis Rio Colorado is 75 km (about 47 miles) from the city of Mexicali in Baja California and immediately south of the city of San Luis in Yuma County, Arizona (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_R%C3%ADo_Colorado).

Mexicali, with a population of 689 775 in 2010, is capital of the Mexican state of Baja California (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicali). The city of Mexicali is located in the Mexicali Valley on the US-Mexico border adjacent to its sister city Calexico, California, which is located in the adjacent Imperial Valley of California (http://earthshots.usgs.gov/earthshots/node/43#ad-image-0). Mexicali is an important industrial, as well as agricultural, center. - Mod.ML
