Pictures, medical reports and autopsy data are being gathered by members of the Medical Association of Aragua state, central north Venezuela, where 9 people have died in the last few days reportedly from a hemorrhagic fever syndrome [see Undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever - Venezuela: (AR) fatal, RFI 20140912.2767248 for more details]. Another person died in Caracas on Sunday [14 Sep 2014] from the same condition.

To date, doctors do not know whether the disease is caused by a virus or bacteria. This will be determined by the test results of the samples sent last week to the National Institute of Hygiene (INH) in Caracas, the only place in Venezuela that has the adequate reagents.

"3 to 5 days are enough for running the tests, but they (health authorities) have not said anything. This is an emergency; we do not know what we are facing, and we need to know the causes in order to provide appropriate treatment to prevent the collapse of the patient's organs, and also to set up epidemiological surveillance. This is a very aggressive disease that causes deterioration of patients within 72 hours and causes death," said a doctor who attended a meeting convened on Tuesday [16 Sep 2014] night at the headquarters of the Medical Association of Aragua state and who requested anonymity.

The doctors attending the meeting insisted that government authorities must declare a health emergency in Aragua state. They reported on 10 deaths from hemorrhagic fever syndrome, including one patient who died in Caracas on Sunday [14 Sep 2014]. Sources said that some culture samples were sent to a private laboratory to determine the causes of the disease.

For professional ethics, doctors would not disclose the names of the patients involved, but they provided details of the autopsy of one of the deceased that reveal the aggressiveness of the disease.

The autopsy report shows hepatomegaly, strong steatosis, congestive spleen, pale kidneys, hemorrhagic enterocolitis, erosive pleuritis and petechiae in the upper limbs.

Representatives of the Medical Association of Aragua state remarked that all the deceased had the same symptoms (high fever, skin rashes and bleeding).

[The results of an autopsy on one individual does not fully help to define the etiology of these deaths, but suggests an enteric involvement with a hemorrhagic colitis as one of the pathologies seen. Interestingly, when using GIDEON (http://www.gideononline.com) with the combination of clinical symptoms and autopsy findings, the leading diagnosis proposed is Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, followed by yellow fever.

A reliable source in the region has mentioned that severe chikungunya infection has been speculated as one of the possible pathologies. Clearly, we await results of laboratory testing for the possible organisms that might explain what is going on.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate more information on this from reliable sources, especially from sources that are apolitical.

For a map of Venezuela showing the states, see http://www.ephotopix.com/image/south_america/venezuela_political_map.gif. The state of Aragua is located to the west of Caracas and borders with the state of Carabobo to its immediate west. They are both in the north, to the northeast of Portuguesa and Barinas, where the cases of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever have previously been identified. - Mod.MPP]
