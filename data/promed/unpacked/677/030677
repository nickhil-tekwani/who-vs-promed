"Research in context - Evidence before this study
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to infect the respiratory tract and affect several other major organs. However, on a cellular level, the localization of SARS-CoV-2 and its targets ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have not been described comprehensively.

"Added value of this study
We have analyzed tissue SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR and visualized its localization together with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 using in situ hybridization (ISH) in 25 different autopsy tissues. SARS-CoV-2 sense and antisense RNA were detected in 16 tissues/organs, mainly in epithelial cells and, to a lesser extent, in endothelial or stromal cells. Detection of viral protein using immunohistochemistry or viral particles using transmission electron microscopy did not yield specific results. Interestingly, apart from the respiratory tract and specifically the lungs, we have not found a specific pathology that would be associated with extrapulmonary viral spread.

"Implications of all the available evidence
We provide a recommendation on using these methods in autopsy diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2. Our data extend the current hypothesis of severe COVID-19 being multisystemic diseases. Our data also provide clear evidence of infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in the endothelial cell across all organs, extending the hypothesis on the (micro)vascular involvement in COVID-19.

"Abstract
Background: Multiorgan tropism of SARS-CoV-2 has previously been shown for several major organs.

"Methods: We have comprehensively analyzed 25 different formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues/organs from autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases (n=8), using detailed histopathological assessment, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using polymerase chain reaction and RNA in situ hybridization, viral protein using immunohistochemistry, and virus particles using transmission electron microscopy. Finally, we confirmed these findings in an independent external autopsy cohort (n=9).

"Findings: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was mainly localized in epithelial cells, endothelial and mesenchymal cells across all organs. Next to lung, trachea, kidney, heart, or liver, viral RNA was also found in tonsils, salivary glands, oropharynx, thyroid, adrenal gland, testicles, prostate, ovaries, small bowel, lymph nodes, skin and skeletal muscle. Viral RNA was predominantly found in cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, or both. The SARS-CoV-2 replicating RNA was also detected in these organs. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy were not suitable for reliable and specific SARS-CoV-2 detection in autopsies. The findings were validated using in situ hybridization on external COVID-19 autopsy samples. Finally, apart from the lung, correlation of virus detection and histopathological assessment did not reveal any specific alterations that could be attributed to SARS-CoV-2.

"Interpretation: SARS-CoV-2 could be observed in virtually all organs, colocalizing with ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mainly in epithelial but also in mesenchymal and endothelial cells, and viral replication was found across all organ systems. Apart from the respiratory tract, no specific (histo)morphologic alterations could be assigned to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"Conclusion: In conclusion, our present study suggests that RT-PCR and FISH performed on FFPE tissues are reliable methods allowing tissue and cellular localization in autopsies. We provide a "cellular and whole body tissue atlas" of organ tropism profile of SARS-CoV-2 in severe COVID-19 patients, suggesting a multisystemic spread in virtually all cell types of infected organs."

[2] Mucormycosis
Date: Sat 5 Jun 2021
Source: BBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57252077


About 12 000 cases of a condition known as "black fungus" have been reported in India, mostly in patients recovering from Covid-19. This severe infection is normally very rare and has a mortality rate of about 50%.

Some medical experts have suggested India has seen cases growing because of the high prevalence of diabetes. But are other factors at work, and what is happening in other countries?

Prior to the Covid pandemic, at least 38 countries around the world had reported cases of mucormycosis, more commonly known as black fungus.

India and Pakistan had the highest rates with around 140 cases per million annually, according to Leading International Fungal Education.

Dr David Denning at the University of Manchester, an expert on fungal infections, says reported cases of black fungus in India were "masses more than any other part of the world" well before the pandemic.

"Mucormycosis is strongly linked with poorly controlled diabetes, and there's a lot of it [diabetes] in India."

In patients recovering from Covid-19, according to a recent research paper looking at cases globally, 94% of those who had the fungal infection also suffered from diabetes. And the majority (71%) of the reported cases of black fungus were from India.

Of the top countries with a high per-capita prevalence of diabetes, others (apart from India) have reported cases of mucormycosis.

India's neighbours, Pakistan and Bangladesh, both have a high prevalence of diabetes in their populations and have had mucormycosis cases, but not in especially large numbers.

In Bangladesh, doctors have been treating one confirmed case of mucormycosis and are awaiting test results for another suspected case. Doctors told the BBC that both patients also had diabetes.

Pakistan has also reported 5 cases of mucormycosis in recent weeks, and 4 had died as of 12 May 2021, according to media reports.

Brazil has reported 29 cases so far, but it's not yet clear how many of these had Covid and/or were diabetic.

Russia has also reported "isolated" cases of mucormycosis in Covid patients recently, but it is unclear how many have been detected so far.

The US has a very high prevalence of diabetes; 9.3% of the population is estimated to have the condition. It also has the highest number of Covid cases globally. But mucormycosis is very rare; diabetes cases there are largely managed with only 3% going undiagnosed, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.

Experts say it's not so much recorded cases of diabetes as the levels of undiagnosed diabetes that are the issue. The IDF estimates that about 57% of those with diabetes in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka are undiagnosed cases, and nearly all of these are found in India. Pakistan is also estimated to have a high proportion of undiagnosed diabetes.

"There's a lot of uncontrolled diabetes in India, because people don't do regular health check-ups," says Dr Hariprasath Prakash at the International School of Medicine in Kyrgyzstan. He says a large majority of diabetes cases are "discovered through other health complications" and remain untreated. Poorly controlled diabetes puts you at higher risk of certain infections, including some fungal ones.

The Africa region also has a high proportion of undiagnosed diabetes, at nearly 60%, but estimates show the incidence of mucormycosis there is low, only 3%.

Dr Denning points out that "it could be because [mucormycosis] cases might be going undiagnosed. It is not the easiest thing to diagnose."

Studies have suggested that cases of black fungus go undiagnosed because of the difficulty in tissue sample collection and the lack of sensitivity of the diagnostic tests.

Experts also suggest that the indiscriminate use of steroids for some Covid treatments could be linked to mucormycosis or other fungal infections. Two widely prescribed steroids -- dexamethasone and methylprednisolone -- are used for Covid patients in India to reduce the inflammation caused by the body's immune response. However, with hospitals and doctors overwhelmed by a growing numbers of cases, there's evidence that these steroids are being taken without medical supervision.

The Indian authorities have recently warned against such self-medication, which can have seriously harmful consequences including, says Dr Denning, increased the risk of developing mucormycosis.

A UK-based trial conducted on around 2000 Covid patients showed that dexamethasone helped reduce mortality in those with a moderate or severe infection but could potentially be harmful for those with a mild infection.

That study showed the efficacy of steroids when used in a hospital setting. However, some states in India are reported to have distributed dexamethasone to the public along with home isolation kits.

"It is very clear (through studies) that more steroids are not better," said Dr Denning.

[3] Europe: Variant Spread in 2020
Date: 7 Jun 2021

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03677-y


Spread of a SARS-CoV-2 variant through Europe in the summer of 2020. (This is an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for publication. Nature Research are providing this early version of the manuscript as a service to our authors and readers. The manuscript will undergo copyediting, typesetting and a proof review before it is published in its final form. Please note that during the production process, errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal disclaimers apply.)

"Abstract
Following its emergence in late 2019, the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been tracked via phylogenetic analysis of viral genome sequences in unprecedented detail. While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020. Here we report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20E (EU1), that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread across Europe. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant's success. Despite travel restrictions, we estimate 20E (EU1) was introduced hundreds of times to European countries by summertime travelers, likely undermining local efforts to keep SARS-CoV-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how a variant can rapidly become dominant even in absence of a substantial transmission advantage in favorable epidemiological settings. Genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes."

The authors highlight: "When a new variant is observed, policy makers need a rapid assessment of whether the new variant increases the transmissibility of the virus, evades pre-existing immunity or has different clinical properties."

"Finally, our analysis highlights that countries should carefully consider their approach to travel when large-scale inter-country movement resumes across Europe. Travel precautions such as quarantine should in principle have prevented spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired abroad, but in practice failed to have the desired effect. While long-term travel restrictions and border closures are not tenable or desirable, identifying better ways to reduce the risk of introducing variants, and ensuring that those which are introduced do not go on to spread widely, will help countries maintain often hard-won low levels of SARS-CoV-2 transmission."

The article has supplementary information about the 1st sequences identified for selected countries across Europe, as well as information about travel restrictions and quarantine requirements over the summer of 2020. - Mod.UBA]
