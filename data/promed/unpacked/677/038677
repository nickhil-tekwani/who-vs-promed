Abstract
--------
We report a case of acute, vectorborne Chagas disease, acquired locally in central Texas, USA, manifesting as Romana's sign, which was initially mistaken for orbital cellulitis. After the infection failed to respond to antibiotics, DNA-based next generation sequencing on plasma yielded high levels of Trypanasoma cruzi; results were confirmed by PCR.

Background
Infection with _Trypanosoma cruzi_, or Chagas disease, is endemic in Latin America. An estimated > 300 000 cases of chronic Chagas disease exist in the United States, predominantly in immigrants who acquired it through vectorborne transmission from triatomine insects in their countries of origin. Multiple triatomine species also exist in the southern United States, and enzootic transmission to dogs or small rodents is common.

However, local cases of vectorborne _T. cruzi_ transmission to humans is rare. In a 2009 review, the number of acute, autochthonous, vectorborne infections acquired in the United States since 1955 was only 7; of these, 4 occurred in Texas. During 2013-2018, a total of 26 locally acquired Chagas cases were reported in Texas, but only 1 was an acute case. Most persons with acute Chagas are asymptomatic, but some have nonspecific constitutional symptoms or Romana's sign, a painless periorbital and conjunctival injection attributed to triatomine feces deposited or inadvertently rubbed into the eye.

Acute Chagas disease may be overlooked in areas outside of Latin America, despite the existence of _T. cruzi_-infected triatomine reservoirs. We describe a case of locally acquired, vectorborne, acute Chagas disease in a patient who manifested Romana's sign; the infection was initially mistaken for orbital cellulitis. We also describe the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) as a helpful diagnostic tool and review potential vector transmission risk in the southern United States.

The Patient
A previously healthy 41-year-old man from central Texas with no medical or travel history described an ocular foreign-body sensation after working outdoors at his ranch. Over the next 2 days he experienced mild conjunctival injection with periorbital erythema and edema (Figure 1) [refer to source URL for figure]. He described mildly blurry vision but no fever, chills, or constitutional symptoms.

On the 8th day of illness, the patient had onset a palpable, left preauricular lymph node. Given the suspicion for oculoglandular syndrome, the patient was switched to intravenous rifampin and doxycycline for possible Bartonella infection. However, results of Bartonella serologic testing and blood cultures were negative.

On day 11 of illness, the patient had onset of fever. His periorbital edema and lymphadenopathy persisted. He remained febrile, and on day 15 he was transferred to a tertiary care center for evaluation. A magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated persistent enhancement of left medial and inferior rectus muscles, compatible with orbital myositis.

On day 16, the patient was started on steroids for possible noninfectious etiologies, including IgG4-related disease, sarcoidosis, or vasculitis. His fever subsequently abated, and the periorbital edema and erythema slightly improved. After discharge, next-generation sequencing were positive for _T. cruzi_ at a high level of 505 DNA molecules/microliter. Additional testing through the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention yielded a positive _T. cruzi_ PCR test, confirming acute infection. The patient received benznidazole (200 mg 2x/d for 60 d), and steroids were discontinued.

He reported some initial general malaise during the 1st week of therapy but thereafter had only mild generalized itchiness but no rash. He had complete resolution of clinical disease by the 5th week of treatment.

[A recent study of a high-risk population in Texas did not find any persons infected (Gunter SM, et al. Chagas disease infection prevalence and vector exposure in a high-risk population of Texas hunters. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 2020;102:294-7. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31872798/).

A CDC review of Chagas surveillance activities in the USA in 2017 (Carolyne Bennett, et al. Chagas disease surveillance activities -- seven states, 2017. MMWR 2018;67;738-41; https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6726a2.htm?s_cid=mm6726a2_w#T2_down) concluded: "In 2017, Chagas disease was reportable in 6 states. Most cases identified, including among blood donors, are chronic cases and are not the result of local vector borne transmission."

Thus, it seems that autochthonous transmission to humans is rare. It seems fair to conclude that even with an increasing number of triatome bugs, the actual health risks to humans are probably low and need further studies. - Mod.EP]
