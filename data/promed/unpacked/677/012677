_Botrytis porri_ in onion seed crops and onion seed. LJ du Toit, ML Derie,
Washington State University, Mount Vernon Research and Extension Unit,
16650 State Route 536, Mount Vernon 98273; T Hsiang, Department of
Environmental Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario, Canada N1G
2W1; GQ Pelter, Washington State University Cooperative Extension,
Courthouse, PO Box 37, Ephrata 98823. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 1178, published
online as D-2002-0801-02N, 2002. Accepted for publication 15 Jul 2002.
During spring and summer 2001, 9 fields direct-seeded with onion (_Allium
cepa_ L.) were surveyed in central Washington for _Botrytis_ species
associated with onion seed crops produced in this semiarid region.
In April 2002 40 plants were sampled from each field in a 'W' pattern, and
20 plants were similarly sampled from each field in June and July. Each
plant was placed in a separate plastic bag, stored at 4 degrees Celsius
(+/- 2 degrees C) for 3 to 5 weeks, sliced lengthwise using a sterilized
knife, incubated in a moist chamber for 5 days, and examined by microscopy.
Fungal growth resembling _Botrytis_ spp. was transferred to acidified PDA
for species identification based on colony morphology, rate of growth, and
spore and sclerotium characteristics (3). Cultures were incubated on a
laboratory bench at 24 degrees C (+/- 4 degrees C) with 8 to 16 h of daylight.
A species resembling _B. porri_ [Bp] (3) was detected in 3 fields in April
2002 at an incidence ranging from 3 to 28 per cent, and in 2 of the same 3
fields during June and July at incidences ranging from 5 to 10 per cent.
Infected plants were asymptomatic at the time of sampling. The isolates
formed brown, cerebriform sclerotia and sporulated sparsely.
Subsamples of seed harvested from each field were assayed for _Botrytis_
spp. To detect internal infection, 400 seeds from each of the 9 fields were
soaked in 0.525 per cent NaOCl for 60 s, triple-rinsed in sterile deionized
water, air dried, placed on a selective agar medium (2) and incubated at 24
degrees C (12 h day/night) for 14 days. Seeds were examined 5, 10, and 14
days after plating, and fungi resembling _Botrytis_ spp. were transferred
to acidified PDA for species determination. Isolates resembling Bp were
detected in 0.75 per cent of seed from 2 of the 3 fields in which this
species was isolated from plant samples.
The internal transcribed spacer 1 region of ribosomal DNA of 4 isolates of
the putative Bp (2 from plant samples and 2 from seed) were sequenced, and
all 4 sequences matched that of Bp registered in GenBank (Accession No.
Z99666) most closely. Bp is a pathogen of garlic (_A. sativum_ L.), leek
(_A. porrum_ L.), and wild garlic (_A. vineale_ L.), but can infect onion
and shallot (_A. ascalonicum_ L.) when inoculated on these hosts (1).
To our knowledge, this is the first report of natural infection of onion by
Bp, and the first report of seedborne Bp on onion.

[In addition to Bp, there are several other species (_B. aclada_, _B.
byssoidea_, _B. cinerea_, and _B. squamosa_) that are pathogens of onion.
_B. squamosa_ causes leaf blight, one of the major pathogens of onion in
cool climates. _B. aclada, _B. byssioidea_, and _B. squamosa_ can cause
rotting of onions during commercial storage rot. Disease incidence can
exceed 50 per cent. Red-skinned onion cultivars are more resistant to neck
diseases than white cultivars. - Mod.DH]
