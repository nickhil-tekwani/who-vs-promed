Cholera in the Americas - situation summary
-------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of 2015 up to epidemiological week (EW) 22 of 2015 [week ending 5 Jun 2015], a total of 16 961 cases have been reported in 3 countries in the Region of the Americas: Haiti (16 687 cases), the Dominican Republic (273 cases), and Cuba (1 case).

The last confirmed case of cholera in Cuba was reported in January 2015, and was reported by the Canada International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point. The case was an individual with history of travel to Cuba.

In the Dominican Republic, in 2014 there were 597 suspected cholera cases recorded, including 10 deaths, which represents a 70 percent reduction in the number of cases and 76 percent reduction in the number of deaths in comparison to 2013. Between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 20 of 2015 [3 Jan-22 May 2015], there were 273 suspected cholera cases registered, including 10 deaths. This represents an increase of 76 percent of the cases recorded for the same period of 2014. This situation in the Dominican Republic is linked to the cholera trends registered in Haiti during the same period. Since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) to EW 20 of 2015, a total of 32 358 suspected cholera cases, including 488 deaths, have been recorded in the Dominican Republic.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) through 31 Mar 2015, there were 738 528 cholera cases, of which 421 013 were hospitalized (57 percent cumulative hospitalization rate), and 8925 deaths. The cumulative case fatality rate remains at 1.2 percent. From EW 1 to EW 22 of 2015 [3 Jan-5 Jun 2015], there were 16 696 cholera cases, including 13 304 hospitalizations (80 percent hospitalization rate), and 140 deaths (case fatality rate of 0.8 percent). The number of cases and deaths reported by epidemiological week in 2015 are showing an increase in comparison to the number recorded in the same period of 2014. In addition, in some weeks of 2015 the number of cases recorded is greater than what was recorded in 2012 as demonstrated in Figure 1 [for figures, see source URL above. - Mod.LL]. Between the months of May and June [2015], the Haiti Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP) has reported outbreak alerts in 4 out of 10 departments in the country.

Cholera is closely related to adequate access to sanitation and drinking water, and for this reason, controlling the disease remains a challenge in countries where there is poor access to sanitation and drinking water. The Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) encourages Member States to remain vigilant and continue implementing the activities PAHO/WHO has recommended since November 2012.

[2] Cholera - UK ex Cuba
Date: Wed 1 Jul 2015
From: Nicholas Beeching <Nicholas.beeching@rlbuht.nhs.uk> [edited]


We write to alert colleagues to the continued presence of cholera in Cuba and to the need to consider this in the differential diagnosis of travellers returning with diarrhoea from that area.

We are treating a 60 year old UK resident who recently returned from a 14 day all inclusive holiday in one of the quality tourist hotels in Varadero, Cuba. He had short lived diarrhea about 6 days after arriving in Cuba in early June 2015, but this disappeared rapidly. On the day of his return to the UK he felt generally unwell and developed profuse diarrhea, but managed to catch the plane home. He continued to have watery diarrhea up to 50 times in a 24 hour period and after 5 days he developed postural dizziness, his blood pressure was reduced to 77/54 and his urine output was greatly reduced. He was admitted to our unit with hypotension and acute kidney injury, which have responded well to IV and oral rehydration. Culture of feces revealed _Aeromonas veronii_, _Vibrio cholerae_ (sensitive to ciprofloxacin and doxycycline), and another _Vibrio_ sp, full identities to be confirmed. He is being treated with oral ciprofloxacin to cover all these organisms, with excellent response.

He had been on a day trip to Havana 2 days before he became ill. His wife, who accompanied him throughout his holiday, remains well but several other people staying in his hotel (not necessarily in the same tour group) had reported severe gastroenteritis symptoms with a similar period of onset. We have notified his case to the GeoSentinel network as a reporting centre and to Public Health England, who will presumably pass details on to the Cuban authorities. We have omitted from this public report the precise details of his travel dates and the resort hotel to allow the relevant authorities to carry out any investigations without prejudice. A 2nd traveler from the same tour group has just been admitted to our unit with prolonged diarrhea, the aetiology of which is being investigated.

After decades with no cases of cholera, the infection reached Cuba again in 2012 [see ProMED-mail archive 20120702.1187070]. By the middle of 2014 over 700 cases had been reported, including travellers returning to North America and to Europe [1,2], but with few local cases after 2013 [see ProMED-mail archive 20130911.1936068]. We have not seen cholera from Cuba before, but our case follows recent reports of a traveler returning to Canada with cholera [3]. This suggests that there is still cholera transmission in Cuba and that this should be considered in travelers returning from Cuba as well as from neighboring countries in the Caribbean, including Mexico [4].

Varadero is a resort town in Cuba's province of Matanzas, and one of the largest resort areas in the Caribbean. It is unclear where the __V. cholerae_ infection was acquired but others ill at the hotel suggest it may be from the hotel in Matanzas rather than from Havana, 70 miles (113 km) away.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Beeching for this report. This is the second report of cholera acquired in Cuba, neither was reported by Cuba but rather from the country that the tourist returned to. Cholera has been likely occurring in the island nation since re-introduced probably by Cuban physicians travelling back from Haiti in June 2012. - Mod.LL]

[3] Cholera - Mexico (Sonora State)

Sanitary District number 5 in the municipality of Navojoa reported the 1st case of cholera [in Sonora state] so far in 2015. The head of the Sanitary District, Martin Ruy Sanchez Toledo, said the patient is a 46-year-old man from the community of Pozo Dulce, in the municipality of Huatabampo, in the south of the state.

The sample was taken on 2 Jun 2015 and tested positive by results. Surveillance in the community revealed no other cases.

It is unclear what is known about the Sonoran isolate regarding whether it is a O1 (or O139). Non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ does occur along the coasts of USA and Mexico, generally (but not always) causing milder illness without the epidemic potential. - Mod.LL
