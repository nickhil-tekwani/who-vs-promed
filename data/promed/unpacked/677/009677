The Bono Region has recorded confirmed cases of yellow fever in 3 districts with one death, Dr Prince Quarshie, the deputy director, public health, at the regional directorate of Ghana Health Service (GHS), has said. Of the cases, 3 were reported in the Wenchi Municipality as well as one each in Tain and Banda districts of the region, he said.

In an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in Sunyani, Dr Quarshie said 2 of the cases, including the dead, a Fulani nomad, were referred from Tinga in the Bole District of the Savannah Region to the Wenchi Government Hospital. He explained the directorate started vaccinating to protect health officials in the Wenchi Government Hospital, saying it was over 10 years that yellow fever vaccination was conducted in the Wenchi Municipality.

Dr Quarshie explained the directorate had intensified surveillance, public sensitization, and awareness creation and appealed to particularly the populace in the 5 districts to report to the nearest health facilities whenever they experienced abnormal headache, general body pains, and weaknesses. He called for effective collaboration between health officials and key stakeholders including district assemblies, traditional authorities, and opinion leaders in the local communities to facilitate earlier detection of cases and prevent an outbreak.

Dr Quarshie said that although there had not been a reported case in the Sunyani Municipality, the directorate conducted mass yellow fever vaccination in the municipality in 2020, and there was the need for residents to be alerted and report any suspected signs to health officials. He added that the health directorate was understudying the situation at the 5 districts where cases were reported, saying if there was the need for mass vaccination, it would be conducted to protect residents, and prevent the possible outbreak of the disease.

"The directorate has put in place all the required measures, but it is imperative for people to go for medical check-ups at the nearest health facilities if they show signs of unusual headache, fever, body pains, and weakness," Dr Quarshie advised.

[Another new region, Bono, with 5 different affected districts, reports cases of yellow fever (YF), bringing the number of affected regions in Ghana to 3. Bono region is located on the far west-central part of the country, relatively distant from the other 2 affected regions [Upper West and Savannah]. Although vaccination in the reporting districts in Bono is being considered, no immediate campaign is reported, nor is the proportion of the population that has already been vaccinated against YF mentioned. One hopes that intensified surveillance will quickly detect new cases should they occur. - Mod.TY
