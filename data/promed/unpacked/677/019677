OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (PUBLIC AFFAIRS)
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20301
No. 255-98 (703)695-0192(media)
IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 22, 1998
(703)697-5737(public/industry)
TOTAL FORCE ANTHRAX VACCINATION DECISION ANNOUNCED
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen has directed the military to proceed
with the previously publicized plan to vaccinate all active duty personnel
and Selected Reserves with the FDA-licensed Anthrax vaccine. Total Force
vaccinations for about 2.4 million military Service members are expected to
begin this summer.
Cohen explained that, "I have approved implementation of the Anthrax
Vaccination Program for the total force. This is an efficient, effective and
safe way to protect our forces against an emerging threat. "On December 15,
1997, I made implementation of the program contingent on the successful
completion of four conditions: supplemental testing of the vaccine; assured
tracking of immunizations; approved operational and communications plans;
and review of the health and medical aspects of the program by an
independent expert," Cohen said. "All conditions for implementing the
anthrax vaccination program for the total force have now been met.
Vaccinations of the active components and Selected Reserve shall proceed
consistent with all specifications of the Food and Drug Administration
approved product labeling."
Today, during his commencement address at the U.S. Naval Academy, President
Clinton emphasized the importance of this initiative. Clinton said, "Because
our troops serve on the front line of freedom we must take special care to
protect them. So we have been working on vaccinating them against biological
threats and now we will inoculate all our armed forces, active duty and
reserves against deadly anthrax bacteria."
The Secretary of the Army will be the Executive Agent for the Department's
Anthrax Vaccination Program. The Army, on behalf of the Executive Agent,
will manage and administer the overall program and monitor the Services'
progress of their respective implementation plans.
After a three-year review, Cohen concluded that the vaccination is the
safest way to protect highly mobile U.S. military forces against a potential
threat that is 99 percent lethal to unprotected individuals. "This is a
force protection issue that was recommended by the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff," Cohen said. "To be effective, force health protection must
be comprehensive, well-documented and consistent. I have instructed the
military to put such a program in place." Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have both started taking the anthrax
vaccinations.
Immunization for our troops is a prudent action. The immunization program
will consist of a series of six inoculations per Service member over an
18-month period, followed by an annual booster. Although protection levels
increase as shots in the primary series are given; the entire six-shot
series is required for full protection, as determined by the FDA. The total
force anthrax vaccination plans were first announced in December 1997. In
March 1998, the vaccination program was accelerated for troops assigned or
deploying to Southwest Asia after all four conditions for implementation had
been successfully met in theater. The estimated cost to vaccinate the total
force over a six to seven-year period is approximately $130 million. This
includes associated costs for transportation, storage, and administration of
the program.
The phased vaccination program will take six to seven years to complete.
Next in priority after those in Southwest Asia and Northeast Asia are early
deploying forces. The remainder of the force, including the reserves and
National Guard, and new recruits will follow. Annual booster vaccinations
for all Service members will become a routine part of force health protection.
