Noroviruses implicated as major cause of traveler's diarrhea
----------------------------------------------
The kind of diarrhea that can send U.S. travelers running from the beach to
the bathroom is most likely caused by one of a family of pathogens called
noroviruses, at least in Mexico, the Caribbean island of Antigua, and the
Central American country of Guatemala, researchers report. Noroviruses were
implicated in 65 percent of cases of traveler's diarrhea among tourists
visiting those countries, according to a new study. And the researchers
added that, the longer [i.e. duration of stay - Mod.CP] the traveler's trip
south, the more likely it becomes norovirus infection will catch up with
them. The finding should spur new research into preventing this
all-too-common problem, researcher Kellogg J. Schwab, an assistant
professor in the department of environmental health sciences at Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said in a prepared statement.
"Noroviruses are known to be a major cause of food and waterborne
gastroenteritis outbreaks in domestic and unique settings, such as cruise
ships, and also have been documented among military groups during
deployment overseas," he said. "However, few studies have investigated the
prevalence of norovirus infection among civilians traveling from
industrialized to developing countries." Reporting in the March issue of
the Journal of Clinical Microbiology [see below], Schwab's team analyzed
stool samples from 34 people who suffered traveler's diarrhea during trips
to Antigua, Guatemala or Cuernavaca, Mexico. Nearly 2/3 of them had at
least one stool sample that tested positive for the presence of
noroviruses, the researchers found. The finding is relatively new, since
molecular detection methods for these viruses have only recently been
introduced into labs in the United States or other countries.
The 1st author, Amy R. Chapin -- a doctoral candidate in the department of
environmental health sciences at Bloomberg -- noted that 11 of the
norovirus-positive stool samples also tested positive for _Escherichia
coli_ bacteria. This suggests that dual infections among people with
traveler's diarrhea may also be more common than previously thought. The
researchers said their findings indicate a need for further research into
the role of noroviruses in traveler's diarrhea.

[The publication referred to above is published in the Journal of Clinical
Microbiology, March 2005, p. 1112-1117, Vol. 43, No. 3. The paper is
entitled: "Prevalence of Norovirus among Visitors from the United States to
Mexico and Guatemala Who Experience Traveler's Diarrhea." There are 14
authors with Amy R. Chapin listed 1st. The abstract of the paper reads:
"Traveler's diarrhea (TD) is the most common infectious illness acquired by
visitors to developing nations. The purpose of this study was to utilize
molecular diagnostic techniques to determine the prevalence of norovirus
(NoV) in TD occurring among visitors from the United States to Guatemala
and Mexico. Stool samples (n = 54) were collected from 34 TD cases and
analyzed for NoV by reverse transcription-PCR and oligoprobe confirmation.
The overall prevalence of NoV was 65 percent. Interestingly, all
NoV-positive stool samples were identified as genogroup I NoVs, and time
spent at travel destinations was found to be an important factor in
determining the frequency of infection (P = 0.003). 11 NoV-positive stool
samples also tested positive for enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli_,
indicating that dual infections with this leading bacterial cause of TD
were very common. Results of this study suggest that NoV infection is a
frequent occurrence among travelers to Mexico and Guatemala who experience
episodes of TD. In addition, the simple molecular detection method utilized
here will serve to facilitate more in-depth epidemiological studies of this
emergent viral pathogen in travelers and other at-risk populations." - Mod.CP]

[2] Rotavirus, hospital - USA (Pennsylvania)

USA: Pittsburgh hospital patients contract rotavirus infection
-----------------------------------------------
A local hospital was forced to take precautions, after several children
contracted rotavirus infection. Patients at Children's Hospital contracted
the virus, which leads to vomiting and diarrhea. Hospital officials say 10
to 12 children caught the virus. 4 of those came down with it while at the
hospital.
One newborn had the virus 3 days after having surgery at Children's
Hospital. He then passed it on to his mother. His mother said: "They
explained to me that's what I had. And there's no antibiotic for it. It
just has to work its course."
Rotavirus infection generally lasts anywhere from 3 to 8 days. Doctors said
the best way to prevent getting the virus is to wash your hands often. The
Centers for Disease Control said that rotavirus is the most common cause of
diarrhea in children and infants. It is transmitted from fecal matter
through contaminated water, food or contact. It can be treated by re-hydration.
