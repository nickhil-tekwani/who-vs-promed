LEGIONELLOSIS, REQUEST FOR EXPERTISE
====================================
From: MattFreije@aol.com
Date: Tue, 20 May 1997 17:23:09 -0400 (EDT)
I need the help of several Legionella experts in answering questions that
are e-mailed from www.hcinfo.com/legionella, a Web site of HC Information
Resources Inc. that has information on Legionella and offers free technical
help by e-mail. Several experts within the U.S. have volunteered to help
when I get questions I can't answer, or too many questions to handle. I also
have two contacts in Australia. But I would like to have help from
individuals in several other countries in order to provide better and faster
answers to questions that relate to specific areas. If you have experience
with Legionella and are willing to help, please send a brief note with your
e-mail address to mf@hcinfo.com. Don't hesitate to name conditions under
which you will help (e.g., that you want no more than one question every
three or four weeks). Also, volunteering does not obligate you to anything.
When I send you a question, you can send it back to me with either an
answer, or a note stating that you choose not to answer it. Any help I can
get, particularly from outside the U.S., will be appreciated.
