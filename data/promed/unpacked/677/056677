The Food Safety Authority is confident that a _Salmonella_ outbreak in the
north-east and west of Ireland has been contained. The symptoms of 36
confirmed cases and five unconfirmed cases were all first experienced
before the public recall on Friday of cooked ham produced by Augherskea
Meats Ltd, Navan, Co Meath. Although laboratory results were still awaited
on three of the unconfirmed reports, no new suspect cases were reported
yesterday.
All confirmed cases have been in the Louth, Meath and Cavan areas. Three of
the five unconfirmed cases are in Co Mayo. The unconfirmed cases include
those of a 17-year-old youth who was hospitalised for three days and a
two-year-old girl in the Westport area of Co Mayo. Both became ill after
eating cooked ham which was purchased from the same premises. Meanwhile,
the Food Safety Authority is continuing its environmental investigation at
Augherskea Meats. The cooked meat unit at the plant remains closed.
