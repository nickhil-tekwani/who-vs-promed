Charlotte County issued a rabies warning Wednesday [1 Sep 2010] after
a pit bull attacked and killed a rabid raccoon. The attack happened
north of Bermont Road and just west of Swaying Palm Drive. The
Charlotte county man and his dog Chance had an unfortunate run-in
with a raccoon on their Punta Gorda farm.

"I went and got a piece of PVC pipe because I was going to whack it.
Chance came out of nowhere and he just jumped on that thing, flipped
it in the air, and shook it and broke its back," said the Charlotte
County resident. Animal Control says the raccoon tested positive for
rabies. It issued a rabies alert to all residents living in east Punta Gorda.

Juergensen says there are several signs [in animals] residents should
be on the lookout for. "You have something called the dumb rabies
where the animal appears to be intoxicated. It staggers, falls over,
things like that. Then you have aggressive rabies where the animal is
full on aggressive. Juergensen says if you suspect an animal is
rabid, avoid it and call animal control immediately.

"It is a deadly disease if you were to contract it and not know it
and not go through the treatment," said Juergensen.

Luckily Chance had his rabies vaccination, but he's not out of the
woods yet. He has to remain in quarantine for the next 6 months.

Public health officials say 3 more people in the Wood River Valley
are undergoing rabies vaccines after encounters with aggressive bats
during the past week.

The Idaho Mountain Express reports one person that was bitten and 2
more that may have been bitten were being vaccinated as a precaution.
The encounters happened in Bellevue, Hailey, and Ketchum.

The rabies virus infects the central nervous system and is almost
always fatal once symptoms appear.

New Hanover County Animal Control Services [ACS] authorities have
confirmed the 8th case of rabies so far this year [2010]. On Wed 1
Sep 2010, a Canterbury Road resident reported she had been attacked
and bitten by a fox as she was getting into her car. Later in the
evening, neighbors found a deceased fox and notified ACS. The animal
was taken to the state lab, which confirmed the wild animal was
rabid. The victim was notified of the results.

Animals that have a current rabies vaccination at the time of
exposure should be re-boostered within 5 days (new Centers for
Disease Control guidelines) of exposure. The CDC recommends
unvaccinated pets be destroyed. There are 3 primary routes of
transmission of the rabies virus, which is carried in the saliva of
the infected animal: 1) the primary route of transmission is through
a bite which breaks the skin of the victim, 2) salivary contact to an
open, fresh wound, or, 3) salivary contact to the mucous membranes of
a potential victim.

When dealing with primary rabies vectors (raccoons, foxes, skunks,
and bats) or unknown animals, such as wildlife, it is recommended
that the animal be handled with protective gloves to prevent viral
transmission. Personal pets should not be handled without protection
directly after being exposed to wildlife, due to the potential for
carrying residual saliva from the infected animal. People should stay
away from any animal that they have not been cleared to hold or pet,
including owned dogs or cats, and especially wildlife.

<http://www.kens5.com/news/Rabid-bat-discovered-at-an-East-Central-middle-school-102119914.html>


An East Central middle-schooler is being treated for rabies after
doctors say he came into contact with a rabid bat. Stevie Gonzales, a
spokesperson for East Central School District says the 7th grader at
Legacy Middle School [in San Antonio], found the bat and brought it
inside the school. Gonzales says once a teacher discovered it, the
bat was taken away and given to animal control where the bat was later tested.

According to Dr Fernando Guerra with Metro Health, the bat tested
positive for rabies. "As a result, the student had to receive
vaccinations and treatments to limit the exposure," Said Guerra.

"If a bite from a rabid animal goes untreated and an infection
develops" Dr Guerra said, "it is almost always fatal." Dr Guerra
warns that anyone exposed to a rabid animal must go to the emergency
room immediately. Guerra says even if the person is not bitten, there
is a chance he or she may still be infected.

Meanwhile Gonzales says the school district has notified all teachers
and parents. "We ask parents to please talk to your children, please
ask them if they have been in contact with a bat, and we have talked
to Legacy Middle School. They are continuing to monitor the school to
make sure there are no more sightings of bats," Said Gonzales.

Since rabies is not [usually] contagious [between humans], Gonzales
says the student has returned to school but is still undergoing treatments.

[Imperial] Fair livestock exhibitors and superintendents got a little
unnerved early last week [week of 23 Aug 2010] when it was learned a
sheep that was intended to be shown at the fair had contracted
rabies. While the rabid sheep had been put down before the fair, 4
pen-mates had already been brought into the livestock barns.

As soon as the owners found out the market lamb tested positive for
rabies, the other 4 sheep were removed from the grounds. Tests later
showed that all 4 animals brought to the fair tested negative for rabies.

The sheep were 4-H [youth organization administered by the USDA] and
FFA [youth organization that promotes and supports agricultural
education] projects of the 3 older children of a couple that are
residents of rural Imperial. The daughter noticed the affected lamb
wasn't eating well during the week before the fair. They tried some
treatments but the animal didn't respond. The animal started becoming
aggressive in the pen and with the other pen-mates. This behavior,
along with the eating behavior of the sheep, prompted them to call
local veterinarian, Dr Dave Johnsen Sunday night, 15 Aug 2010.

Together, they determined there was something wrong with the animal
and decided not to take it to the fair. The sheep was put down that
evening and Johnsen decided to send the sheep's brain to the lab at
Kansas State, where rabies testing is done. Surprisingly, the test
came back positive on Tue 17 Aug 2010.

Johnsen realized something wasn't right with the sheep but said he
never really suspected rabies. He could only speculate on how the
sheep contracted rabies. He said the residents told him they had shot
a strange acting skunk about 4 to 6 weeks prior. Dr Johnsen said it's
possible the skunk could have bitten the sheep but the real cause
will likely never be known.

After the positive test, he notified the resident, who had already
checked in the 4 other pen-mates at the fair that morning. The sheep
were removed from the grounds Tuesday afternoon [17 Aug 2010]. Dr
Johnsen kept the sheep at his clinic, before putting them down for
further testing. Johnsen said the brains of the 4 other sheep tested
normal with no rabies conditions present.

The resident said they would have never brought their other sheep to
the fair had they known the one was positive for rabies. Dr Johnsen
said rabies doesn't pass from animal to animal [unless they bite or
scratch] so the likelihood the other 4 animals were infected was very slim.

While the information the other 4 tested negative proved to be good
news, it didn't offset the fact that all 7 members of the family had
to have rabies shots.

The owner said she panicked when she first heard the lamb had rabies.
There wasn't a sufficient supply of rabies vaccine in area hospitals
so they drove to Denver [Colorado], where an ample supply existed.
While it was ample for the family, she said their shots took half of
the rabies vaccine supply in Denver.

A young neighbor who had played with the sheep also received the
vaccine series.

This is a wake-up call to the 4-H council and the fair board as to
what procedures are in place if an animal is found to be infected
and/or contagious. While there was some immediate panic about the
situation, Dr Johnsen said the proper precautions were taken by
removing the animals from the grounds and having them tested.

[The theme of many of the rabies updates is vaccination could have
prevented tragedy. Some states or areas within states that hare
having an increase in wild animal rabies should perhaps consider the
oral rabies vaccine baits. Of course, such a course is dependent upon
many factors including which animal is the primary problem.

This last story illustrates that any animal can be susceptible to
rabies. This moderator has long advocated that if you are working
with that animal in a capacity that brings you into frequent contact,
then rabies vaccination should be part of your protocol, and at the
very least a discussion with your veterinarian.

There is one other interesting fact pointed out in the last article
and that is the amount of PEP (post exposure prophylaxis) available
in any given area. Perhaps that is a discussion for county medical
planners or other responsible medical officials within an area. - Mod.TG]
