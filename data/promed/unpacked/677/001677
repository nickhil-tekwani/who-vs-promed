Carla M. Barbosa, Nicholas Di Paola, Marielton P. Cunha, Manica J. Rodrigues-Jesus, Danielle B. Araujo, et al. Yellow Fever Virus in Urine and Semen of Convalescent Patient, Brazil.

Abstract
Yellow fever virus RNA is usually detected in blood of infected humans. We detected virus RNA in urine and semen samples from a convalescent patient. A complete virus genome was sequenced for an isolate from a urine sample. This virus had a South American I genotype and unique synapomorphic changes.

The patient had traveled to Januria, Minas Gerais, Brazil, on 28 Dec 2016, and to a rural area north of Sao Paulo on 3 Jan 2017. On 6 Jan [2017], he had fever, chills, body pain, and nausea. During days 1-3 after symptom onset, more severe symptoms developed: persistent fever (temperature 39.5 C-40 C [103-104 F), headache, body pain, prostration, vomiting, dizziness, anorexia, dark stools, dark yellow urine, and bitterness in the mouth.

On 13 Jan [2017], the patient returned to Sao Paulo and was admitted to a public hospital. Another ELISA for dengue virus NS1 was performed and showed a negative result. His platelet count decreased to 57 000/mm3. On 16 Jan [2017], the patient was admitted to a reference hospital for infectious diseases in Sao Paulo. He showed a moderate clinical presentation: anicteric form and mild spontaneous hemorrhage (ecchymosis in the right eye). High fever, gastrointestinal symptoms (vomiting and diarrhea), weakness, adynamia [lack of strength], and generalized myalgia were also observed. The patient had a weight loss of 4 kg [9 lbs.] over 8 days. Serum and urine samples were obtained

We extracted virus RNA by using the NucliSENS EasyMag Kit (bioMrieux, Marcy l'toile, France). We tested samples for YFV by using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) and primers specific for YFV and a conventional PCR and pan flavivirus primers. Serum samples showed negative results for both PCRs. However, a urine sample obtained 10 days after initial symptoms was positive for YFV (cycle threshold [Ct] 17.42, 9.3-106 RNA copies/mL) by qRT-PCR. We also performed a qualitative IgM-capture ELISA with a specific virus antigen and obtained positive results (optical density 1.19).

For the urine sample that was positive for YFV RNA by qRT-PCR, we directly characterized viral diversity by using next-generation sequencing (Technical Appendix). In South America, phylogenetic studies have inferred 2 circulating YFV genotypes. The isolate from our patient (BRMG-2017) clustered with South America I isolates, including 2 viruses isolated in 2017 in Esprito Santo, a state bordering Minas Gerais, and other viruses isolated previously in Brazil (Figure, panel B).

We did not observe any insertions or deletions in BRMG-2017 nucleotide sequences when compared with sequences of other South America I strains. However, several synapomorphic changes were detected (V108I [capsid], E1572D [NS3], R1605K [NS3], K2608R [NS5], V2645I [NS5], G2680S [NS5], N2804S [NS5], V3150A [NS5], and N3216S [NS5]). Most of these changes were located in the NS5 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) gene, which plays a major role in virus replication. Changes in the NS5 gene have been associated with differences in viral replication, immune response, and protein-protein interactions during virus replication.

Our results suggest that semen can be a useful clinical material for diagnosis of yellow fever and indicate the need for testing urine and semen samples from patients with advanced disease. Such testing could improve diagnostics, reduce false-negative results, and strengthen the reliability of epidemiologic data during ongoing and future outbreaks.

The epidemiological significance of finding viable YF virus in urine and evidence of the virus in both urine and semen is unknown but may be of diagnostic value when there is no evidence of YF virus in blood. The date is not given when semen was taken that had evidence of YF virus presence but, presumably, was the same as that for YF positive urine, 10 days after onset of disease. It is not clear whether semen was tested for the presence of viable virus when it was present in urine, or speculation on whether YF virus in urine might have contaminated the semen upon collection. Follow up studies are needed to determine how frequently YF virus can be found in urine or semen from infected individuals or whether virus persists in testicular tissue with risk of sexual transmission and effects on sperm numbers and morphology as occurs with Zika virus infections. - Mod.TY
