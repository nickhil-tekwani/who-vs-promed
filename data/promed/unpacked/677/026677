The Nagpur [district] orange crop has taken a major hit. Almost 72 000 hectares have been hit by disease. More worryingly, the disease is spreading. The Orange Growers' Association of India (OGAI) said the supply of oranges has dipped by over 30% to 40% due to citrus greening [which] has rendered a large volume of citrus fruit non-marketable.

OGAI has requested research institutes like ICAR [Indian Council of Agricultural Research] and agricultural universities, to conduct research and suggest [an] integrated management plan, so that the problem could be minimised during the next crop cycle.

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both, pathogens and vectors, can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and chemical or biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause similar symptoms in citrus and coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been reported (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20180214.5629251). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

In India, CaLas was shown to be widespread in all commercial citrus species and hybrids, and present in most states including Maharashtra (ProMED-mail post 20150409.3285806). While molecular diagnosis has apparently not been obtained for the outbreak reported above, CaLas seems to be the most likely pathogen involved.
