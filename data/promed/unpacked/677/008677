In December 2012 a 53-year-old female traveller developed fever with headache, arthralgia, and exanthema in combination with lymphadenopathy and mild hepatitis 3 days after returning from an 18 day trip to Bali. Laboratory diagnostics of the blood sample, taken one day after onset of symptoms, showed leucocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and mildly elevated transaminases.

Whereas serological investigation revealed negative results for chikungunya and dengue virus, the PCR-result for chikungunya virus was positive. The virus strain could successfully be isolated by cell culture; molecular characterization of the isolated chikungunya virus is in progress.

A serological follow up specimen 47 days after the 1st examination showed seroconversion for chikungunya virus with high titres for IgM- and IgG-antibodies while no serological evidence for a coinfection with dengue virus was found.

The patient had direct flights from Germany to Bali and back without a stay in any other chikungunya virus-endemic area. She predominantly stayed in the coastal region around Semenyak with excursions in the regions around Ubud. She reported several mosquito bites during her holidays but no clinical symptoms in Bali. Currently the patient still complains of headaches and arthralgia.

While chikungunya fever cases in Indonesia seem to be frequent in Central and Western Java, there have been only sporadic reports from Bali so far (see ProMED-mail posting 20080720.2198). Healthcare authorities should be aware of the ongoing occurrence of chikungunya fever in Bali. Travellers should be advised to apply preventive measures (such as, protection from mosquito bites).

[This case points out the need to take a good travel history in order to include tropical diseases in rule outs for a definitive diagnosis when patients fall ill on return to their temperate zone homes. Although there is no possibility of ongoing transmission of chikungunya virus in Germany, this case should serve as an alert for health care providers who advise travelers going to chikungunya virus endemic areas to avoid mosquito bites. Since Bali is a major tourist destination, any outbreak could have a negative impact on tourism.

ProMED-mail thanks Drs Wolfel, Vollmar, and Poluda for this first-hand report.
