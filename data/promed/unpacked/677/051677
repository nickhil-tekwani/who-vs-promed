Germany has entered a "nationwide state of emergency" because of surging coronavirus infections, the head of the country's disease control agency said Friday [19 Nov 2021]. Lothar Wieler, the head of the Robert Koch Institute, said regular medical care cannot be guaranteed anymore in some parts of the country because hospitals and intensive care wards are overstretched.

The German air force confirmed a report by daily Bild that it was preparing to help transfer patients to clinics with free beds. "All of Germany is one big outbreak," Wieler told reporters in Berlin. "This is a nationwide state of emergency. We need to pull the emergency brake."

He called for urgent additional measures to tackle the rise in COVID-19 cases, which topped 50 000 for the 3rd day running. The Robert Koch Institute also reported 201 further deaths, taking the toll to 98 739 since the start of the outbreak.

Wieler's comments came as the upper house of parliament on Friday [19 Nov 2021] approved new measures to control the outbreak proposed by the center-left alliance that emerged after the 26 Sep 2021 national election. The measures, which come into force Wednesday [17 Nov 2021], include requirements for people to prove they are vaccinated, recently recovered from COVID-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access shared workplaces or public transport. Employees will also have to work from home, whenever possible.

Separately, outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed with the governors of Germany's 16 states to introduce a new threshold linked to the number of hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients per 100 000 people over a 7-day period. Some states are also considering mandatory vaccinations for some professional groups such as medical staff and nursing home employees.

Neighboring Austria, which has also been hit by a surge in new cases, announced it would extend a nationwide lockdown to vaccinated people from Monday [22 Nov 2021] and introduce compulsory vaccinations from February [2022]. Such measures are not currently being discussed in Germany, where the outgoing Merkel government and the 3-party alliance hoping to replace it are at odds over how to respond to the pandemic.

Germany's current health minister, Jens Spahn, called Friday [19 Nov 2021] for a "national common effort" to respond to the rising case numbers. "In the short term we won't manage to break the wave (of infections) with vaccinations and booster shots alone," he said at a joint news conference with Wieler, who called on Germans to help limit the spread of the virus by reducing their social contacts.

The southern state of Bavaria announced Friday [19 Nov 2021] that it is cancelling all Christmas markets this year and closing bars and clubs for 3 weeks. Bavarian governor Markus Soeder said regions with more than 1000 new weekly cases per 100 000 inhabitants would face even tougher restrictions, including the closure of all restaurants, sports and cultural venues.

German lawmakers have approved new measures to rein in record coronavirus infections after the head of Germany's disease control agency warned the country could face a "really terrible Christmas." The measures passed in the Bundestag on Thursday [18 Nov 2021] include requirements for employees to prove they are vaccinated, recovered from COVID-19 or have tested negative for the virus in order to access communal workplaces.

[2] Plant-derived antiviral drug
Date: Fri 19 Nov 2021

A plant-based antiviral treatment for COVID-19, recently discovered by scientists at the University of Nottingham, has been found to be just as effective at treating all variants of the virus SARS-CoV-2, even the highly infectious delta variant. The struggle to control the COVID-19 pandemic is made more difficult by the continual emergence of virulent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are either more infectious, cause more severe infection, or both.

In a new study published in Virulence, a group of scientists, led by Professor Kin-Chow Chang from the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science at the University, found that the delta variant, compared with other recent variants, showed the highest ability to multiply in cells and was most able to directly spread to neighbouring cells (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21505594.2021.2006960). In co-infections with 2 different SARS-CoV-2 variants, the delta variant also boosted the multiplication of its co-infected partners.

The study also showed that a novel natural antiviral drug called thapsigargin (TG), recently discovered by the same group of scientists to block other viruses, including the original SARS-CoV-2, was just as effective at treating all the newer SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the delta variant. In their previous studies (1,2), the team showed that the plant-derived antiviral, at small doses, triggers a highly effective broad-spectrum host-centered antiviral innate immune response against 3 major types of human respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

In this latest study, the team set out to find out how well the emergent alpha, beta and delta variants of SARS-CoV-2 are able to multiply in cells relative to each other as single-variant infections and in co-infections -- when cells are infected with 2 variants at the same time. The team also wanted to know just how effective TG was at blocking these emergent variants.

Of the 3, the delta variant showed the highest ability to multiply in cells and was most able to spread directly to neighbouring cells; its amplification rate at 24 hours of infection was over 4 times that of the alpha variant and 9 times more than the beta variant.

In co-infections, the delta variant boosted the multiplication of its co-infected partners. Furthermore, co-infection with alpha and delta or alpha and beta conferred multiplication synergy, where total new virus output was greater than the sum of corresponding single-variant infections.

Notably, all SARS-CoV-2 variants were highly susceptible to TG treatment. A single pre-infection priming dose of TG effectively blocked all single-variant infections and every co-infection at greater than 95% relative to controls. Likewise, TG was effective in inhibiting each variant during active infection.

Professor Kin Chow Chang, lead author of the study, said: "Our new study has given us better insights into the dominance of the delta variant. Even though we have shown that this variant is clearly the most infectious and promotes production of other variants in co-infections, we are pleased to have shown that TG is just as effective against all of them.

"Together, these results point to the antiviral potential of TG as a post-exposure prophylactic and an active therapeutic agent."

[3] CDC: booster dose
Date: Sat 20 Nov 2021

Faced with rising infections and an anticipated surge in holiday travel, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday [19 Nov 2021] endorsed booster shots of the coronavirus vaccines for all Americans over 18. The recommendation fulfills President Biden's pledge in August [2021] to make the extra doses available to all adults, and caps months of scientific debate over whether most people really needed boosters. The shots are already available at many drugstores, doctors' offices and vaccination centers.

The CDC said that Americans over age 50, as well as those 18 and older living in long-term care facilities, "should" get booster shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. All other adults over age 18 "may" get booster doses, the agency decided. Recipients of Johnson & Johnson's one-dose vaccine already were cleared to get a booster at least 2 months after the initial shot.

Earlier on Friday [19 Nov 2021], the Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots for all Americans over age 18. But the CDC usually sets the clinical guidelines adopted by the medical profession. A panel of scientific advisers approved the expansion of eligibility earlier on Friday, and the agency's director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, endorsed the recommendation early in the evening.

Many experts worried that extra doses were not needed by most adults to prevent serious illness and death, and that a push for boosters could constrain global vaccine supplies even as people in many poor countries have not received their 1st doses. But infection rates are rising again in the United States and soaring in much of Europe. After recording more than 14 000 new infections on Thursday [18 Nov 2021], Austria will go into a nationwide lockdown on Monday [22 Nov 2021] and impose a coronavirus vaccination mandate in February [2022], the first such mandate in a Western democracy.

Health officials in many of these countries, and now in the United States, see booster shots as a way of shoring up defenses against a tenacious enemy and gaining the upper hand in the pandemic. France, for example, has mandated booster shots for those over age 65 who wish to get a health pass permitting access to public venues.

"Look what other countries are doing now about adopting a booster campaign virtually for everybody," Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration's top COVID adviser, said on Tuesday [16 Nov 2021] at a conference sponsored by Stat, the medical news publication. "I think if we do that, and we do it in earnest, I think by the spring [2022] we can have pretty good control of this."

In the United States, infections have increased by 33% on average over the past 2 weeks, to 94 000 a day. The CDC's decision landed just as Americans prepare to spend the holidays with family and friends, gatherings likely to accelerate the trend.

The shots may help forestall at least some infections, particularly in older adults and those with certain health conditions. But many experts, including some who advise federal agencies, are skeptical that boosters alone can turn the tide.

The extra shots are unlikely to offer much benefit to adults under 65, who remain protected from severe illness and hospitalization by the initial immunization, the experts said. "Overall protection remains high for severe disease and hospitalization," said Dr. Sara Oliver, an epidemiologist at the CDC, told the scientific advisers meeting on Friday [19 Nov 2021].

Moreover, tens of millions of Americans have not received even the 1st dose of a coronavirus vaccine. In the United States, as in Europe, deep pockets of vaccine-resistant adults are likely to prolong the pandemic, however well protected their neighbors may be.

Many Americans seem unmoved by the sudden push for boosters. More than 85% of the adult population became eligible when the CDC added depression and other mental illnesses to the list of conditions that qualify people for an extra vaccine dose. But only about 18% of those ages 18 and older have chosen to get one. And those may not be the people most in need of extra protection.

The most effective strategy for the administration would be to rush booster doses to residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities, said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center. These are the adults mostly likely to benefit. At the moment, fully vaccinated white people are more likely to have obtained booster shots, compared with other racial and ethnic groups, according to data compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

[4] India: breakthrough infections
Date: Wed 17 Nov 2021 07:10 IST
Source: The Times of India [edited]
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/over-half-of-covid-cases-in-oct-were-breakthrough-infections/articleshow/87746000.cms


[SK] (age 50), a resident of Sector 30, felt relief in July [2021] after a nervous year and a half of manoeuvring through the pandemic when he got his 2nd dose of Covishield and was "fully vaccinated." On 15 Oct 2021, [SK], who has a coronary artery disease, tested positive for COVID-19. The infection took him by surprise and shook his confidence. Although there was no need for hospitalisation and he was treated at home, his family members are now terrified and also worried about post-COVID syndrome and other complications.

Like [SK], there have been several other cases of breakthrough infections -- a term used to denote cases wherein people get infected despite being fully vaccinated. Most of these patients, according to doctors, were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms like cold, cough and fever, but did not require hospitalisation, which shows that the vaccine offers some degree of protection.

[AS] (age 62), a resident of Sector 48, got COVID on 1 Nov 2021, 4 months after receiving his 2nd shot. "I got the infection from my son who was going out for work every day. I was admitted to hospital for 2 days as a precautionary measure because I have been suffering from diabetes for the past 20 years. I have recovered but because of the pollution, the effects of COVID linger and I still feel ill most of the days," [AS] said.

Similarly, 65-year-old [GS], who lives in Sector 65, got infected on 29 Oct 2021. A chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patient, she got her 2nd dose of Covishield on 26 Jun 2021.

"I was shocked that I got infected, as I had never stepped out of the house for fear of COVID. Relatives came to visit us during the festival season, and it is not possible to maintain social distancing at home and wear a mask. Luckily, I was not hospitalised. I am still on medication, as my lungs are compromised," she said.

The percentage of breakthrough infections in the total case share has been increasing in the past couple of months, revealed government data. From 26% in August [2021] (43 out of 163 cases), it rose to 41% in September (62 out of 150 cases) and 56% in October (157 out of 206 cases).

Doctors said breakthrough infections are expected to occur, as no vaccine promises 100% protection. "They are common. It is important that such cases are detected timely in order to start treatment at the earliest," said Gurgaon chief medical officer Virender Yadav.

He added that vaccination may have given people a false sense of confidence, prompting many to flout COVID protocols. The infections, he said, showed why even the fully vaccinated can't let their guard down and should continue to follow COVID norms like social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing a mask.

Dr. Manoj Goel, director, pulmonology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said less than 1% of the breakthrough infection patients required ICU admission or oxygen beds, as vaccination reduced the severity of the symptoms. Deaths in such cases were rare, he added. "In cases where fully vaccinated people succumbed, the victims were either very old or had severe comorbid conditions," said Dr. Goel.

Dr. Ankita Baidya, consultant (infectious diseases), Manipal Hospital, said while the breakthrough infections have been of the delta variant, they were yet to see a case where a patient who had recovered from it during the 2nd wave got re-infected.

[This should not be overly concerning because "less than 1% of the breakthrough infection patients required ICU admission or oxygen beds, as vaccination reduced the severity of the symptoms. Deaths in such cases were rare...the victims were either very old or had severe comorbid conditions." One can conclude that although reinfection was higher than one would like to see after vaccination, the reinfected individuals were still protected from severe illness, which would not have been the case had they not been vaccinated. - Mod.LK]
