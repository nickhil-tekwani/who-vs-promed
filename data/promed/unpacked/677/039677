I agree with your comments re. avian influenza (AI) in ProMED post
20060518.1396. It is common practice in Southeast Asia (Thailand 2004) to
dump chicken and duck intestinal tracts from processing plants into
commercial fish ponds. This practice continued even after the disease was
diagnosed in Thailand when I visited operations there. It is presumed that
in China, where nothing is wasted, similar activities contribute to
dissemination of AI virus in lakes and waterways (see Dave Stallknecht's
work in Cameron Parish).

[Simon and I were once fellow faculty members in the old LSU Epidemiology
and Community Health Department. He has extensive consultancy outreach in
Africa and Asia. Apropos virus-contaminated water, there is an interesting
WHO Review: "Review of latest available evidence on risks to human health
through potential transmission of avian influenza (H5N1) through water and
sewage," available through the WHO report
<http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/emerging/h5n1background.pdf>
on the possibility of spread to humans through exposure to contaminated
water. It is well worth reading. Though it is equivocal on the risks, it
lays out the data very well for the reader to make his or her own
conclusions. It also raises the specter of risks from human sewage and the
need for improved safety procedures for sewage workers. - Mod.MHJ]

Bird lovers in denial over bird flu
-------------------------------------
Most of us, at some time in our lives, have refused to believe something we
don't want to believe despite considerable evidence that it is true. Such
denial is understandable; the truth can be painful. But there are times
when denial can also be dangerous. The reluctance of some ornithologists,
conservationists and other members of the birding community to accept the
role of wild birds in spreading H5N1 bird flu is a striking example.
The H5N1 virus emerged and acquired its nastiness in poultry; there's no
dispute about that. The trade in poultry is also overwhelmingly responsible
for H5N1's spread in east Asia. It was a different story, however, when the
virus, having killed wild geese at Qinghai Lake in China, spread across
Russia and into Turkey, Ukraine and Romania. The strain found in all these
places is identical to the one 1st seen at Qinghai, never in east Asian
poultry, which strongly suggests that it was not carried west by poultry.
Maps of the outbreaks look a lot like the migration maps of dabbling ducks,
long-distance migrating birds that tolerate the virus.
Since then, the evidence has become even clearer. There have been outbreaks
in western Europe almost exclusively in wild birds, and in all cases of
bird flu west of Qinghai, the virus is identical, suggesting it has found a
carrier in which it is more stable than in chickens. Yet the critics refuse
to listen. They tend to start with the conclusion that wild birds must
never be blamed, and then marshal "evidence" to support their case,
ignoring any that doesn't. Wild birds are being made scapegoats for a
disease that evolved on battery farms, they say; they're the victims, not
the vector, ignoring the fact that they can be both. Or they invoke
alternative explanations and demand they be disproved: the virus found in
birds in a German nature reserve could have gotten there in Turkish chicken
waste used as fertilizer rather than from ducks migrating from Siberia.
Some have come round to the idea that the virus is being carried by wild
birds, but others are still in denial. This month [May 2006], we heard
hopeful claims that because the spring migration across the northern
hemisphere has not been accompanied by an explosion of bird flu, no wild
birds are carrying the virus. Yet everything scientists know about bird flu
epidemiology indicates that this is not surprising: it's likely that a few
infected birds have arrived at their summer locations, that over the coming
months they will infect others, and that prevalence will peak in the autumn.
I am not the only one concerned about all this. "The ornithology community
has been slow to acknowledge that wild birds might be playing some role,"
says one senior European virologist. A top American virologist who himself
resisted the evidence about wild birds admitted: "It's a political debate,
not science." A UN official told me: "They aren't speaking from evidence."
Their attitude could have consequences for how we tackle the spread of
H5N1. We need birding experts to predict where the virus might migrate next
rather than deny that it will. The influence of birders is said to underlie
the British government's decision not to force poultry farmers to keep
their birds inside. If nothing else, wild birds are indeed victims of this
virus, and their advocates should be fighting to protect them from it, not
denying it is there.
Ask birders why they are scared of implicating wild birds, and they'll say
it encourages people to cull them and undermines conservation efforts. It's
true that some people worried about bird flu have threatened to shoot birds
or destroy wetlands, but as far as I have been able to discover, nothing
much has materialized.
I'm skeptical that this worry is the real reason. A clue as to what this
might be emerged in April 2006 at the 1st, hastily arranged World Migratory
Bird Day in Nairobi, Kenya, which was described by its conservationist
organizers as happening "at a time when migratory birds are being unfairly
portrayed solely as the harbingers of death and disease," an absurdly
exaggerated claim. Another critic said: "The real question is not, are wild
birds to blame, but why are wild birds being blamed?" In other words, this
isn't about evaluating evidence, it's about building conspiracies. The only
reason I can think of for all this is that we are dealing with a community
acting more on faith and emotion than reason. For them, birds are, by
definition, innately pure and transcendent, too pure to carry anything as
mundane or dirty as a virus. Given this attitude you can understand their
denial, but they are doing neither wild birds nor humans any favors.

[I don't think that anyone can deny that there are crossing wild bird
cycles of pathogenic AI infection and infection cycles and transmission in
commercial and backyard poultry. The bigger questions are where in the
avian ecology will the changes occur that will facilitate the H5N1 virus
(and other AI viruses) becoming demonstrably pathogenic for humans, if it
persists and why, and the economic impacts of the industrial and domestic
costs of AI. Neither are simple. One might argue that any AI virus that had
successfully mutated to chronic infectivity in birds and suddenly acquired
the ability to infect significant numbers of humans, might find the latter
of negative advantage if there were no humans to infect. Put another way,
if a mutation does not provide a competitive advantage or benefit, the new
organism disappears. - Mod.MHJ]
