[This is follow up information for last month's (June 2010) report on
H5N1 in Tibet; see reference below. For further descriptions of the
particular wild birds involved, please see the links below.
Unfortunately, we don't have any new or follow up information on the
types of birds involved in the Russian outbreak reported around the
same time in June 2010.

It is worth remembering that this year (2010), there have been more
H5N1 outbreaks recorded than last year (see FAO/EMPRESS H5N1 HPAI
Global Overview Issue No. 22, April 2010 for detailed data on recent
trends of the increasing number of outbreaks). Outbreaks in this part
of the world are of epidemiologic interest because the broad, general
area of western Asia, where the recent outbreaks have occurred, was
one of the jumping off points for the original spread of the disease
outside of Asia. - Mod.PC]
