(H5N1) in migratory birds. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet].

-----------------------------------------------
Abstract
"The claim that migratory birds are responsible for the long-distance
spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtype H5N1
rests on the assumption that infected wild birds can remain
asymptomatic and migrate long distances unhampered. We critically
assess this claim from the perspective of ecologic immunology, a
research field that analyzes immune function in an ecologic,
physiologic, and evolutionary context. Long-distance migration is one
of the most demanding activities in the animal world. We show that
several studies demonstrate that such prolonged, intense exercise
leads to immunosuppression and that migratory performance is
negatively affected by infections. These findings make it unlikely
that wild birds can spread the virus along established long-distance
migration pathways. However, infected, symptomatic wild birds may act
as vectors over shorter distances, as appears to have occurred in
Europe in early 2006."
[Last paragraph of the Results:]
"Sparse findings on immunocompetence and exercise in migratory birds
do not decisively rule out the possibility that HPAI (H5N1) may be
transported relatively short distances by wild birds. That birds are
leaving areas with cold weather does not necessarily imply stressful
long flights and the physiologic adjustments that accompany
long-distance migration. Even birds incapacitated by an infection may
therefore manage to escape harsh weather. However, causes and
consequences of cold weather movements have not been investigated in
sufficient detail. An analysis by Feare supported the view that
long-distance spread of virus by migratory birds is unlikely but
short-distance spread is possible. Feare examined all known major
outbreaks in wild birds and concluded that most occurrences reflect
local acquisition from a contaminated source, followed by rapid death
nearby. Outbreaks in Europe in 2006 indicate that infected wild birds
can travel a limited distance before dying of influenza and can pass
the virus to other wild or domestic birds."

investigation, the possibility that wild birds may play a part in
short distance transfer is still on the table. - Mod.MHJ]
