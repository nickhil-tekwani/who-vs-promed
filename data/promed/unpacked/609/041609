More than 30 people who ate at a Thai restaurant in Las Vegas this year [2022] have reported getting sick, the Southern Nevada Health District said Friday [18 Feb 2022].

Health officials are investigating what led up to what they called "unusual" illnesses. Patrons of the Secret of Siam restaurant located on Centennial Center Boulevard reported increased heart rates, blurred vision, disorientation, loss of consciousness, and numbness or tingling within hours of being at the restaurant.

The Health District is asking anyone who ate there in January or February [2022] to take a survey on its website. Las Vegas police also have fielded some reports of illness.

The restaurant opened in 2019 and consistently passed inspection reports, KTNV-TV in Las Vegas has reported.

Some customers have told local news outlets they suspect their food was tainted with THC -- the compound in cannabis producing the high sensation -- after seeking medical attention and testing positive for it.

[Raw cannabis contains tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), compounds that must be exposed to heat, such as in cooking, smoking or baking, to turn into the active forms, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The content of each varies depending upon the variety of cannabis and the amount of the plant used in the food preparation.

Consumption of cannabis products is different than smoking the product. Effects from consumption often may be felt approximately 30-90 minutes after ingestion. Effects will also vary with the weight of the consumer, the amount consumed and, of course, the specific variety consumed.

This article provides us a few symptoms of the ill individuals. Additional signs may include delusions, hallucinations, sleepiness, blurred vision or vision abnormalities, sleepiness and confusion. Those named in the beginning of the article are consistent with cannabis ingestion. - Mod.TG
