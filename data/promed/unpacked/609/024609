A mumps outbreak that began on the Ohio State University [OSU] campus in January [2014] has now infected 447 people, the largest outbreak the state has seen since 1979, when there were 930 cases of the disease, according to Columbus Public Health (CPH). A total of 155 students, 31 OSU staff members and 54 community members with an OSU link have fallen ill. The campus outbreak has also spread to Indiana and North Carolina, where one OSU student from each state became sick shortly after returning home for the summer, CPH spokesman Jose Rodriguez said.

The most recent Ohio mumps case was reported on [23 Jun 2014], according to the Ohio Department of Health, and the people affected have ranged in age from 6 months to 80 years old. CPH is reporting that among those who have fallen ill there have been cases of hearing loss, and inflammation of the testes and ovaries, which are rare complications of the disease. There have also been 14 hospitalizations.

Mumps is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. Fortunately, most people with mumps recover completely after a few weeks. The most common symptoms are similar to those of the flu: high fever, aches and fatigue. The virus can also cause a tell-tale swelling of the parotid glands in the jaw, called parotitis, which can be painful and make swallowing and eating difficult.

[When ProMED-mail last posted almost a month ago, there was a total of 361 cases of months in Ohio (Mumps - USA (06): (OH) update 20140606.2524005). Most cases were in Franklin County (208 cases, 58 percent) and linked to the Ohio State University (OSU) campus in the city of Columbus, Ohio. The city of Columbus and OSU are located in Franklin County. The outbreak subsequently spread into the surrounding counties (Delaware, Fairfield, Licking, and Union) in central Ohio. Now there are 447 cases, and most cases continue to be linked to OSU (240 cases, 54 percent), with spread to the US states of Indiana and North Carolina, as students return home for summer break.

The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before college enrollment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). However, OSU does not mandate immunization against mumps before matriculation.

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students, where the intensity of exposure among students presumably overcomes vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm). Perhaps waning post-vaccination immunity and antigenic differences between outbreak strains and the vaccine virus are additional explanations for mumps outbreaks in highly vaccinated populations (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/47/11/1458.full). - Mod.ML
