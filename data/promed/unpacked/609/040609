A roadkill white-tailed deer collected by Texas Parks and Wildlife Department personnel on U.S. Highway 87 between Dalhart and Hartley has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD). This marks the 1st discovery of CWD in a Texas roadkill and the 1st case in a Texas Panhandle whitetail.

"The roadkill was found along the border between the current CWD Containment Zone and Surveillance Zone, and as a result will likely necessitate a precautionary expansion of the Containment Zone," said Dr. Bob Dittmar, State Wildlife Veterinarian with TPWD. "We do not believe there's a need to expand the Surveillance Zone at this time."

TPWD staff will present a proposal detailing the expansion of the Containment Zone during the TPW Commission's [Wed 24 Jan 2018] public hearing. The proposed expansion of the Containment Zone will not result in any new requirements for hunters or landowners unless they are engaged in a permitted activity such as moving live deer.

The disease was 1st detected in the Panhandle in 2015 when a mule deer buck tested positive during routine CWD surveillance. Additional information about CWD is available on the TPWD website.

[The 1st case of CWD in Texas was discovered in 2012 in free-ranging mule deer in an isolated area of far West Texas. The disease has since been detected in a total of 13 mule deer in that West Texas population located in the Hueco Mountains, and 3 mule deer and one elk in Dallam and Hartley counties, located in the northwest Panhandle.

The 1st case of CWD in Texas white-tailed deer was found in a deer-breeding facility in 2015 as a result of routine disease monitoring. Increased testing requirements resulted in the detection of CWD in 4 additional deer breeding facilities and 2 release sites adjacent to the CWD-positive deer breeding facilities. CWD was detected in a free-ranging white-tailed deer in Medina County in 2017.

A total of 50 CWD positive deer and elk have been discovered in Texas to date, 32 of those from white-tailed deer either in, or originating from captive deer breeding facilities, 16 from free-ranging mule deer, one free-ranging elk, and one free-ranging white-tailed deer. See CWD Positives in Texas for details and chronology of CWD detections in Texas.

With the discovery of CWD in a captive deer breeding facility in south-central Texas, the Texas Parks and Wildlife (TPW) Commission adopted comprehensive CWD Management Rules on June 20, 2016. These rules address CWD management associated with permitting programs that authorize intensive deer management activities, and were developed through a collaborative process that involved substantial stakeholder input. A copy of the rules is available to download as a PDF. Additional rules regarding CWD monitoring zones and carcass movement restrictions were adopted by the TPW Commission on August 25, 2016. As new cases of CWD were discovered in additional captive deer breeding facilities, as well as free-ranging deer and elk in 2016 / 2017, the TPW Commission adopted modifications to the rules pertaining to live-deer movements into, within, and out of CWD Containment Zones and Surveillance Zones. Both sets of rules are intended to reduce the chances of spreading CWD and increasing the chances of detecting and containing CWD in areas where it might be present.
