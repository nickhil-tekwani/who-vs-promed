PLUM POX VIRUS, STONE FRUIT - CANADA: (ONTARIO) UPDATE

A concentrated growing area is complicating efforts to eliminate plum
pox virus from Canada's main peach producing region in Ontario. The
virus was expected to be eliminated by now. But Eric Wierenga,
Canadian Food Inspection Agency, said that won't happen, because of a
number of factors, including the tight concentration of at-risk
orchards in Ontario's Niagara Peninsula. The high concentration of
trees in the area facilitates spread of the disease and has resulted
in a greater incidence of the virus in some parts.

The Niagara Peninsula is the sole growing region left to achieve
eradication while other regions in Nova Scotia and Ontario have
already eliminated the virus. The disease was first identified in
Ontario and in Pennsylvania in the USA in 2000. Pennsylvania
announced itself free of the disease last year [2009], but recent
testing in Ontario identified the virus in 108 orchard blocks as well
as 4 residential properties.

One element of the elimination strategy is the establishment of
buffer zones around infected trees, within which all trees will be
removed. Pennsylvania established a buffer of 500 meters [0.3 mi],
but the breadth of that buffer would decimate the close-packed
Ontario industry.

While buffer zones work for transmission by aphids, blocks where the
disease was introduced by infected plant material will be removed
altogether. To date, 354 798 trees have been removed. The Canadian
government will have spent approximately CAD 180 million [approx. USD
179.9 million] on the eradication by the end of March 2011.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus)
is widely distributed in Europe and also present in parts of Asia,
northern Africa, and the Americas, but absent from Australia and New
Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to
100 percent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Symptoms can occur on
leaves and fruit and may include ring or line patterns, mottling and
distortion, as well as premature fruit drop and shoot dieback.
Infection may be symptomless in some host species or cultivars. Some
hosts in other genera are also susceptible including hops, pea,
tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants. PPV isolates have been
grouped into several strains according to their serological and
molecular properties, and some strains do not infect certain _Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical
inoculation, grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not
known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The
importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still
being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk
of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is
difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of
virus reservoirs, and use of certified planting and grafting
material. Resistant stone fruit cultivars are available.

Eradication attempts of PPV (and other plant pathogens) once
established in an area have often been unsuccessful in the past.
Associated high costs and practical difficulties are illustrated above.
