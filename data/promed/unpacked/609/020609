DENGUE/DENGUE HEMORRHAGIC FEVER - MALAYSIA
==========================================

From: "Lam Sai Kit, Kenneth" <lamsk@medicine.med.um.edu.my>

The dengue season in Malaysia has started in earnest, and cases notified
to the Ministry of Health have doubled those of the corresponding period
last year in at least eight states. The WHO Collaborating Centre has
processed almost two thousand specimens, an increase of 122.7%, and
51.4% were confirmed to be dengue serologically. What is worrying is not
so much the increase in cases over the previous year but the increase in
severe cases.
Thirty-eight DHF/DSS cases have been confirmed by the
Centre compared with 11 for the same period last year. Of these 38
cases, 16 were Malays, 14 Chinese and 8 Indians. The increasing
tendency of severe dengue to appear in older children and adults is
again evident. At least 3 cases had evidence of central nervous system
involvement.
>From the virological surveillance, dengue 1 is the predominant strain,
followed closely by dengue 2. Dengue 1 virus was last reported as a
major cause of the disease in 1987 and 1988, and its return after almost
10 years will undoubtedly give rise to many cases in children born after
1988. Dengue 2 was implicated in the severe outbreaks between 1989 to
1991, and was associated with the more severe form of the disease. The
current combination of dengue 1 and dengue 2 will likely lead to high
morbidity and mortality this year.

year's DEN-1 strain was probably imported from? - Mod.JW]
