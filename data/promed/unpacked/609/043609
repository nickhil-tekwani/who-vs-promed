DRANCUNCULIASIS, IMPORTED - USA EX SUDAN

Imported Dracunculiasis Â— United States, 1995 and 1997
Dracunculiasis is a parasitic infection caused by a filarial worm
(_Dracunculus medinensis_ [i.e., Guinea worm]) that is transmitted through
contaminated drinking water. Approximately 1 year after a person is
infected, one or more meter-long adult female worms begin to emerge through
the skin, often incapacitating the patient for more than 2 months. Despite a
dramatic decrease in cases worldwide, dracunculiasis is still occasionally
imported into the United States. Since 1995, two cases of dracunculiasis
have been reported in the United States, both imported from Sudan. This
report summarizes the investigation of these cases...
MMWR Editorial Note: No case of dracunculiasis transmitted in the United
States has ever been reported, and importations of dracunculiasis to the
United States are infrequent. Although both cases in this report involved
refugees from Sudan, they differ in clinical manifestations and
epidemiologic significance.
The detection and investigation of every active case brought to the United
States enables identification of places where dracunculiasis may still be
present and prevents establishment of a focus of transmission in the United
States. CDC requests that medical practitioners report any cases of
dracunculiasis in the United States since 1990. A brief description of the
case, including where the patient may have acquired dracunculiasis, location
of treatment, approximate date of worm emergence, and clinical outcome
should be reported to Guinea Worm Cases, Division of Parasitic Diseases,
National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC, Atlanta, GA 30333; telephone
(770) 488-4531; or by e-mail: kdk1@cdc.gov.
