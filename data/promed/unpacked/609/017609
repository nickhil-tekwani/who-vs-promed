The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has found that _Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus_ (SRBSDV) is the cause of the stunting of rice observed in Punjab and its adjoining states [ProMED post 20220825.8705229].

Infected plants were reported to be stunted with narrow, erect leaves; both roots and shoots were affected. In severely infected fields, withering of plants was also reported. Disease incidence was more pronounced in early sown crops, irrespective of variety.

Analysis of soil and plant samples from affected fields showed no relationship of stunting with nutritional deficiencies. Further analysis of plant samples for the presence of other rice pathogens, including 9 viruses and one phytoplasma, were negative.

[_Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus_ (SRBSDV; genus _Fijivirus_) has been identified recently and is now considered an emerging pathogen in Asia. Symptoms may include darkening and distortion of leaves, tumours with black streaks along leaf veins, as well as severe stunting of plants. It is transmitted by the white backed planthopper (WBPH; _Sogatella furcifera_). SRBSDV can also affect maize, sorghum, and several grasses as additional crop or reservoir hosts.

Black streaked dwarf disease (BSDD) of rice due to the related _Rice black streaked dwarf virus_ (RBSDV; same genus _Fijivirus_) had previously been known to cause serious crop losses in South East Asia. It also affects some other graminaceous hosts but is spread by different planthoppers including the small brown planthopper (_Laodelphax striatellus_) which cannot spread SRBSDV (and vice versa).

Disease management for rice viruses may include cultural practices, vector control, and use of cultivars with resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. Since no crop varieties resistant to SRBSDV have been identified yet, insecticide sprays against the vectors currently appear the best option.

The new SRBSDV and an increase in WBPH numbers are a major concern in
the region where the rice crop is already frequently affected by other viruses and their insect vectors.
