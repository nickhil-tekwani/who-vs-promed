The Food Standards Agency [FSA] of the UK is warning people not to eat certain batches of vacuum packed cold smoked trout from Inverawe Smokehouses in Taynuilt, Argyll after Argyll and Bute [Scotland] local authority identified concerns over the procedures in place at the company to control a bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_.

No trace presence of _Clostridium botulinum_ has been found in product tested, however the batches of smoked trout are being recalled as a precaution.

The affected batches will no longer be on sale as the use by dates are between 30 May 2014 and 1 Sep 2014. Waitrose has been confirmed as one of the outlets that sells Inverawe Smoked Trout 100g in a number of its shops and is communicating to its customers. The FSA is in the process of investigating wider distribution. The mail order products are not affected.

Although none of these products will be on sale, there is a possibility that some consumers may have frozen the product at home and still have it in their freezers. The instructions for home freezing on the product labelling allow for storage of up to 3 months. Consumers are advised not to consume these products. Instead, the product should be returned to the store where it was purchased from or disposed of.

[ProMED-mail thanks Tony Elam for this contribution.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_. - Mod.LL
