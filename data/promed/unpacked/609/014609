There's another case of measles reported in New Jersey, the 17th this year [2019]. And it comes from an area where cases have been reported before.

Officials reported a dozen cases in and near Ocean County earlier this year [2019] and thought they were nipped in the bud back in May 2019. "We have had an outbreak in Ocean County in measles cases earlier this spring," state epidemiologist Tina Tan told KYW Newsradio. "So we are seeing clusters of measles cases pop up in certain vulnerable populations."

That's particularly true where people frown on getting vaccinated.

The latest confirmed case involves someone who visited a Lakewood synagogue, Congregation Belz.

The county executive says even though the crisis is over, the measles outbreak is still active. However, the number of cases per month has decreased.

More than 25 000 people were vaccinated since the outbreak started in October 2019. That's more than double the normal amount in a year.

The week ending 18 Jul 2019 brought an increase in the number of measles cases, the number of outbreaks, and the number of states with cases in 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The total number of confirmed cases of measles in the United States is now up to 1148 for the year, which is 25 more than the previous week, the CDC said on 22 Jul 2019. The highest 1-week total for the year was the 90 cases reported during the week of 11 Apr 2019.

The number of outbreaks is back up to 5 as California returned to the list after a 1-week absence, and El Paso, Texas made its 1st appearance of the year [2019]. The current outbreak in California -- the state's 5th -- is occurring in Los Angeles, which is now up to 16 total cases in 2019. El Paso just reported its 4th case on 17 Jul 2019, and the city's health department noted that "it had been more than 25 years since El Paso saw its last case of measles before these 4 recent cases." Outbreaks also are ongoing in Rockland County, N.Y.; New York City; and 3 counties in Washington State.

States that joined the ranks of the measles-infected during this most recent reporting week were Alaska and Ohio, which brings the total number to 30 for the year, the CDC said.

Aragonese health authorities have confirmed a measles outbreak in the province of Huesca, more specifically, by a contagion that occurred in the emergency department of the Barbastro Hospital, which in turn had its origin in a patient who returned from Romania with measles.

So far, 3 cases have been confirmed, including the patient considered to be the "index case," the traveler who, after returning from Romania, "coincided in the observation room of the emergency department of the Hospital of Barbastro with the other 2 cases."

The same sources have indicated that none of these 3 patients had a history of vaccination.

When you scroll through social media feeds in Turkey today, you'll likely come across posts sowing doubt and confusion about vaccines: "They're injecting children with the genes of pigs and monkeys with vaccines! The vaccines that America and other governments sell to Turkey are not the same as the ones they use themselves. The children that get vaccinated have autism."

The Facebook group "We are Not Obligated to Vaccinate," for example, has 12 000 followers.

The Turkish Medical Association -- Turkey's largest professional organization for doctors -- warned in April 2019 that the country is at risk for outbreaks of preventable diseases that have already been eradicated in Turkey due to the increase in anti-vaccine messaging and vaccine rejection by parents.

Last year [2018], measles cases increased 8-fold in Turkey with 716 reported cases in 2018, according to the World Health Organization. As of 10 Jul 2019, the number of confirmed cases for 2019 spiked to 1468, according to monthly data reported by the Turkish government.

Two main groups reject vaccines in Turkey, according to Dr. Nilay Etiler, a public health expert and member of the Turkish Medical Association working group on vaccines: A growing number of Muslims believe that vaccines contain pork, which is forbidden in Islam. The other group is secular and typically well-educated, who often believe that vaccines contain harmful substances like aluminum or mercury.

While Turkey's Health Ministry advises a slate of childhood immunizations against 13 diseases, no law exists to mandate the ministry's vaccination program. The General Health Act, passed in 1930, requires the smallpox vaccine, but health officials no longer administer it because the disease was eradicated worldwide in 1980.

In a 2016 decision, Turkey's top Constitutional Court reaffirmed a lack of legal basis for mandatory vaccinations when it ruled in favor of parents who refused all vaccinations for their children. Citing the constitution's protection of individual rights, the court ruled that vaccinations cannot be given without parental consent.

The number of vaccine refusals reached 23 000 for 2017 -- up from 11 000 in 2016 -- according to the Health Ministry immunization advisory board's latest government figures. Parents in Turkey may opt out of scheduled vaccinations for their children by signing an official rejection form.

A Turkish member of parliament, Murat Erdemir, of the opposition Republican People's Party, or CHP, has called for updated data, but the Health Ministry has not yet released vaccine refusal numbers in 2018.

Etiler says that this lack of data means that Turkey's level of herd immunity -- or the rate of vaccination at which low-immunity individuals are protected -- is unclear: "We don't have an estimation for possible outbreaks, because we don't know the vaccination rates."

According to Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs, a government body in charge of mosques and Islamic institutions, Muslims may use medicine that contains materials forbidden in Islam if a halal option does not exist or is not available and if a qualified doctor recommends it.

"The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm or death is extremely small," according to the Mayo Clinic, a medical nonprofit and research organization. The National Health Service for the UK states that anaphylaxis, which can lead to breathing difficulties or collapse, is a possible but ultimately rare side effect affecting less than one in one million people.

The Singapore Ministry of Health has noted an increase in the number of measles cases in Singapore in recent weeks. In the past week, there were 17 confirmed cases of measles infection at a residential home for persons with intellectual disability, and a foreign worker dormitory.

Officials say there is no evidence of community spread from these cases.

As of 22 Jul 2019, 116 measles cases have been notified to MOH in 2019. 88 of these cases were local, and 28 were imported from Bangladesh, Dubai, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. No deaths were reported in 2019 arising from the notified cases of measles.

Peak dengue season in Singapore: 8000 cases, 5 times last year's [2019] number.

Measles vaccination is compulsory by law for all children residing in Singapore, as children are at high risk of developing complications.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has confirmed a new measles case in Taiwan but said it is still searching for the source of the infection because the patient works at Taoyuan International Airport and had not traveled abroad in the past month.

A man in his 20s was confirmed to be infected with measles Sun [28 Jul 2019], CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said, noting that the patient developed a fever on 21 Jul 2019 but did not see a doctor until a rash broke out on his face, chest and hands on 24 Jul 2019.

The case was reported to health authorities that day, and tissue samples were sent for laboratory testing. Two days later, the test results came back positive for measles, which led to Sunday's [28 Jul 2019] confirmation, according to the CDC.

Also, in the light of the man's workplace and the fact that he made no overseas travel over the past month, the patient may have been infected himself by a traveler from a measles-stricken area who contracted the disease but had yet to develop symptoms, he said.

The origin of the infection still needs to be clarified, Chuang said.

Taiwan has recorded 108 measles cases so far this year [2019], with 67 indigenous cases and 41 imported cases, according to CDC data. Of the 41 imported cases, 36 involved Taiwanese nationals.

Measles outbreaks have been seen in neighboring countries, the CDC said, noting that as of 19 Jul 2019, there had been 3800 cases reported in Thailand this year [2019] and 349 cases in New Zealand, while Viet Nam had reported 4700 confirmed cases as of the end of June 2019.

An inmate at Mt Eden remand prison has been isolated after contracting measles on Sat 27 Jul 2019. The man and his cellmate are in isolation, and only staff who are immune from the contagious disease are working with them.

The sick prisoner did not leave the prison or have any visitors during the exposure period.

The prison has almost 1000 inmates, and about 500 staff. Corrections are taking particular measures to monitor the 120 other prisoners who were in same 2 units as the man last week.

Nationwide, 54 people contracted measles last week -- the largest number so far this year [2019] -- with 50 in Auckland, mostly in the Counties Manukau area.

From last month [Jun 2019], health authorities in Auckland started giving out the measles vaccine at one year instead of 15 months in an effort to curb the region's outbreak of the disease.

There was one case each in Waikato, Hawke's Bay, Capital and Coast and Canterbury.

About 1/3rd of all cases are children under 9 years old, and the next most common group are people in their 20s.

About 85 percent of those infected are people who have not been vaccinated.

In total, 407 people have been confirmed to have had measles in New Zealand this year [2019].

The disease has been on the rise across the world in recent years, with cases tripling worldwide.
