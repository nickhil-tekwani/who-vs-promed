New cases spark farm disease fears
------------------------------
In Northumberland 3 more cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been
confirmed, sparking fears [that the infection has spread to other farms.
The new cases, which bring the total number in the area to 6, were within
the zone where the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
(DEFRA) has now imposed tight controls. A government vet warned [that up
to 8000 livestock may have to be slaughtered, after the cases started to
emerge within a 5 mile area around Hexham on Thursday.
Officials have described the latest outbreak as "a major setback" in the
fight against FMD. An investigation is continuing into how many other farms
could be facing culls as dangerous or contiguous contacts. Footpaths in the
area have been closed and the army is on standby to deal with any further
cases. "Draconian" restrictions have now been imposed around 550 farms in
Northumberland.
The controls come as a huge blow to farmers who hoped restrictions would
soon be lifted in the area, which had been disease-free for 3 months. The
National Farmers Union North East director Richard Ellison said: "We fear
there are going to be more, it's showing that sort of pattern. It is not
looking good. They have suspicions it has already reached other farms." Mr
Ellison said it was still not known how the virus spread.
It was reported that 2 farmers involved in the cases confirmed earlier this
weekend have bought animals from the same market, which could mean [that
infection has been transferred to more farms.
"Blue box" regulations are to be introduced around Stone Hall Farm near
Catton, Taylor Burn Farm at Ninebanks near Allendale, and Nettle Hill Farm
at Allendale. The restrictions, used to control the outbreak in Thirsk,
North Yorkshire, earlier this year, designate an area in which all animal
movements are banned, apart from those licensed to be sent directly to
slaughter. The box is about 7 square km, roughly from Slaley in the east,
Blanchland in the south, to Haltwhistle in the west, and Hexham and Haydon
Bridge in the north.
There are now 9 operational disinfecting stations with police patrols.
Officials have been meeting with police to discuss the idea of 24 hour
patrols on the roads to enforce the security zone. Within a 10 km radius of
the premises, 20 extra vets have been drafted in to inspect an estimated
130 additional farms to which the disease may have spread.
Disease facts
Total: 1977
New cases on Sunday: 4
Slaughtered: 3 780 000
Awaiting slaughter: 12 000
Awaiting disposal: 3000
Another new case [was reported in Cumbria on Sunday, bringing the total
cases in the UK to 1974. In the past few weeks Cumbria, one of the areas
hit worst by the disease, has averaged 2 new cases a day. Divisional
veterinary manager Arthur Griffiths said 2 of the 3 new cases in
Northumberland were contiguous to the previous outbreaks and the third was
on the edge of 2 of the 3 km zones.

[The continuing occurrence of new cases of FMD this close to autumn and
winter is disturbing. The virus survives longer in cold weather. - Mod.TG
