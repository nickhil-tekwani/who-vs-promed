The number of deaths from a listeriosis outbreak that have been linked
to contaminated meat products has reached 20, Canadian health
officials said Wednesday [1 Oct 2008]. The latest death occurred in
Ontario, where 15 of the deaths have been reported, the Public Health
Agency of Canada said in a news release. 2 deaths occurred in the
western province of British Columbia, with one each in Alberta, Quebec
and New Brunswick. The health agency said 6 other deaths under
investigation may also have resulted from the outbreak.

The disease originated from the Toronto deli-meat processing branch
of Maple Leaf Foods plant, Canada's biggest food company. The
_Listeria_ bacterium was found deep inside slicing equipment,
according to company officials. The plant reopened 4 weeks after
being closed on 20 Aug 2008.

Several class-action suits are being planned as a result of the
outbreak, which has led to one of the most serious food crises in
recent Canadian history.

[The above news release reports 20 deaths but does not state the
total number of confirmed and suspected cases linked to the strain
discovered at the Maple Leaf Foods plant. A news release on 2 Sep 2008
<http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&sid=aHQGyjTAgrKA&refer=canada>
reported that there were 12 deaths among 38 confirmed cases of
listeriosis across Canada, with another 21 under investigation. When
last posted by ProMED (Listeriosis, fatal, meat product - Canada (03)
20080828.2701), there were 12 fatalities among 26 cases of the
disease from the same strain of listeria that was identified at a
Toronto plant run by Maple Leaf Foods Inc., with an additional 29
cases under investigation.

The incriminated Maple Leaf Foods products were recalled in late
August 2008. With an incubation period for listeriosis of up to 70
days, more cases related to the outbreak can be expected. A detailed
discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail posting no.
