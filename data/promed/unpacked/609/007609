A severe outbreak of hepatitis A has reportedly struck a region of eastern Uzbekistan, sickening hundreds, according to Uznews.net. The news agency called the situation an "epidemic." According to news reports, at least one hospital in the Fergana Valley is overflowing with more than 100 patients, all with hepatitis A infections. One source said that every household in the region has 2 or more people sick with the virus.

The head of the country's sanitary and epidemic board at the Ministry of Health told reporters he did not see a reason for concern, as a hepatitis A outbreak happens every year. But because hepatitis A outbreaks rely on food as a point source, seasonal outbreaks would only conceivably occur from a seasonal food -- or a seasonally contaminated food. Speaking on anonymity, a doctor in the country said the health officials were "covering up" the situation, and that it was against regulations to cite the actual number of victims falling ill.

While newborns in Uzbekistan are vaccinated for hepatitis B, hepatitis A vaccines are rare and difficult to afford in the impacted region. Symptoms of hepatitis A infection include fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, jaundice, and dark urine. The illness can persist for months if untreated, and often comes from eating food or drinking water contaminated via contact with infected fecal material.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is primarily spread when an uninfected (and unvaccinated) person ingests food or water that is contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associated with a lack of safe water, inadequate sanitation, and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality.

Hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection. Epidemics related to contaminated food or water can erupt explosively. Hepatitis A viruses persist in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens.

Hepatitis A virus is transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. The virus can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and may take several weeks or months. Several hepatitis A vaccines are available internationally. All are similar in terms of their side effects and how well they protect people from the virus. No vaccine is licensed for children younger than one year of age. Nearly 100 percent of people develop protective levels of antibodies to the virus within one month after a single dose of the vaccine. Even after exposure to the virus, a single dose of the vaccine within 2 weeks of contact with the virus has protective effects.
