[The 3 recent, yet unresolved, outbreaks of which one is in the north
(Ramat Magshimim) and 2 in the south (border Gaza strip and the
Bedouin township of Rahat) are already marked (as red circles) in
OIE's interactive map on the Israeli epizootic, available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529.
Resolved outbreaks are marked by the blue circles.

The following list includes all outbreaks in Israel during the 2011
epizootic:
Location / District / Starting date / species
1. Bet Zera / North / 1 Mar 2011 / cattle (Location in map
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345).
2. Yavneel / North / 21 Apr 2011 / cattle
3. Tuba-Zangariyya / North / 6 May 2011 / cattle, sheep, goats
4. Senir / North / 8 May 2011 / cattle
5. Sharona / North / 11 May 2011 / cattle, sheep
6. Majdal Shams / North / 15 May 2011 / cattle *
7. Kefar Szold / North / 17 May 2011 / cattle
8. Gaza-strip-border / South / 25 May 2011 / sheep, goats
9. Ramat Magshimim / North / 31 May 2011 / cattle
10. Rahat / South / 2 Jun 2011 / sheep, goats *
* Not yet serotyped (as of 12 Jun 2011).

It will be surprising if the FMDV strain from Majdal Shams (North
province, Golan district) is not found to be similar to the serotype O
strain circulating in the north. Similarly, it may be assumed that the
strain from Rahat will be found closely related if not identical to
the FMDV serotype O identified recently in the other southern
outbreak, on the border with the Gaza strip. However, since serotypes
A and Asia 1 are reportedly circulating as well in the Middle East,
preferably sampling and lab identification be performed in all
outbreaks. Genotyping is anticipated as well; Israel has persistently
submitted FMDV isolates for confirmation and genotyping to the WRLFMD
at Pirbright (WRLFMD Israel page at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm).
