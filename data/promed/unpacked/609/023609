With one more polio case reported from Beed district, the number of
polio cases in Maharashtra has gone up to 5 in the last 10 months,
health officials said [in Mumbai] today [6 Oct 2010].

An 11-month-old child from a ''banjara (migrant)'' family in Beed was
reported to be suffering from polio, state Health Directorate
additional director CM Kulkarni said.

The child had received 3 doses of oral polio in June, July, and
September [2010]. However, he developed paralysis on [16 Sep 2010]
and was admitted to a hospital at Umargaon in Osmanabad, he said.

"Although Uttar Pradesh and Bihar were reported for the last few
years as the breeding ground for poliovirus, this year [2010], out of
the total 16 cases of P-1 type (more harmful and spreads faster)
polio [also known as wild poliovirus type 1 or WPV1], 5 are from
Maharashtra, 7 from Mushirabad in West Bengal, one from Jammu and
Kashmir, and 3 from Bihar," director of the Enterovirus Research
Institute of ICMR [India Council of Medical Research] JM Deshpande said.

From January to September [2010], a total of 38 polio cases were
reported from across the country, Deshpande said.

[According to the most recent data available on the polio eradication
website presented above, as of 5 Oct 2010 there have been 39
confirmed cases of polio attributable to wild poliovirus infection
(WPV) in India since January 2010 -- representing one tenth of the
number of confirmed cases as of the same date in 2009. It is a major
achievement for the global polio eradication effort and for India if
this can be sustained. More information available at the polio
eradication website mentions that there were 2 new cases reported in
the past week, one a WPV type 1 in Maharashtra (the case mentioned in
the newswire above) and the other, a WPV type 3 in Jharkhand.

On a more sobering note, there were 10 new cases (all WPV1) reported
in Pakistan in the past week. The polio eradication website points
out that Pakistan is the only endemic country to have seen more cases
this year [2010] than at this point in 2009. - Mod.MPP]
