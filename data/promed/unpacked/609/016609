The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) is investigating a cluster of Legionnaires' disease cases in Union County. The Department is aware of 14 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease, including one death, among individuals who live in or spend time in the county.

The cases were reported to the Department between [3 Feb and 26 Feb 2021]. The Department is working with the local health departments in Union County to investigate this cluster. The individual who died was a male resident of Union County in his late 60s.

"This is a continuing investigation. The risk to anyone who lives in Union County is very small," said New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli. "Out of an abundance of caution, the Department recommends that individuals who live in Union County who become ill with pneumonia-like/respiratory symptoms, such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, and headache visit their healthcare provider."

The risk of Legionnaires' disease among residents or recent visitors to Union County is low. Most healthy people exposed to _Legionella_ do not develop Legionnaires' disease. People over the age of 50, especially those who smoke cigarettes, or those with certain medical conditions, including weakened immune systems, chronic lung disease or other chronic health conditions, are at increased risk for Legionnaires' disease.

As part of the continuing investigation, the Department is conducting epidemiologic and environmental investigations to identify possible sources of exposures to the bacteria, conducting environmental sampling for _Legionella_, and recommending environmental remediation strategies to prevent further transmission of _Legionella_. Some potential sources have been identified and remediation has begun at those sites, but other sources may be identified as part of the ongoing investigation.

[The above news article reports a "cluster" of 14 confirmed cases of Legionnaires' disease in individuals who live in or spend time in Union County, New Jersey in Feb 2021. A cluster usually refers to multiple cases in space and time that are possibly linked. An outbreak of Legionnaires' disease would imply that a common source is suspected (https://legionnaires.ecdc.europa.eu/?pid=205). Genotyping the clinical isolates will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. We will await further findings from the investigation of this cluster.

Possible sources include aerosols generated from a _Legionella_-contaminated plumbing system by showerheads, sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, and hot tubs/spas. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 C [77-104 F] in plumbing systems support the highest concentrations of the organism.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment; the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/).

_Legionella pneumophila_, the usual _Legionella_ species causing legionellosis in the USA, has been shown to persist for long periods in the biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems is usually done by culture, which would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Union County, with about half a million residents, is located in the northern part of the US state of New Jersey; it is part of the New York City metropolitan area, immediately west of Staten Island (Richmond County), one of the 5 boroughs of New York City (U.S. state of New York); its county seat is the city of Elizabeth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_County,_New_Jersey).
