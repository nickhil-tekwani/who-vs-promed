Kala-Azar hits Southern Nepal
-------------------------
[A Kala-azar epidemic has hit four districts in Terai plain of southern
Nepal since the start of the monsoon season in mid-June.
According to statistics released Thursday by Advance Medicare Hospital in
Birgunj, an industrial city bordering India, out of 1000 people on whom [a
bone marrow test was performed, 148 showed the symptoms [signs of
Kala-azar. At least one person has died of the disease so far, the
hospital [spokesperson said. "It is an alarming situation as 15 percent
of those tested are shown to be affected by the disease," lab chief at the
hospital, Amar Thakur, told the press. "If treatment is not done in time,
thousands of people may die of Kala-azar," he added.
The Administration in the four affected districts -- Parsa, Bara, Rautahat
and Sarlahi -- have not yet taken any measures to combat the disease, a
local report said. District hospitals cannot accommodate the increasing
number of patients due to limited facilities and resources, the report
said.
Kala-azar, a virulent infectious malarial [protozoal but not malaria
disease of oriental tropics, is one of the common diseases in Nepal that
takes a toll of at least several hundred people every year.

[An infection rate of 15% of febrile hospital patients is certainly
alarming. The diagnosis is based on microscopy of bone marrow samples, and
it would be prudent to ask for confirmation of the diagnosis. In any case,
the reports show that leishmaniasis is a diagnosis to be considered in
febrile patients in Nepal and coming from Nepal. - Mod.EP
