Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Volume 94, Number 26. A
new study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, may
help provide insight into how infectious proteins called prions from cattle
infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) can cause a fatal
neurodegenerative disease, a variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in humans.
These cases may be due to the consumption of prion-tainted beef products
from infected cattle. It is generally thought that these cattle developed
BSE after ingesting prions contained in meat and bone meal made from the
remains of butchered sheep and cattle. Understanding how prions are
transmitted between species is essential for assessing the impact of Great
Britain's BSE epidemic on human health. But no reliable, specific test for
BSE prions in live animals is currently available.
The article beginning on page 14,279 is the first report of genetically
engineered mice that are highly susceptible to BSE prions and consistently
demonstrate symptoms of the disease in less than 250 days following
exposure. Symptoms can sometimes take years to appear in humans. The
researchers note that these genetically engineered mice now make possible an
accurate determination of BSE prion concentrations in brain and other
tissues, as well as the evaluation of drugs and other medicinal products
derived from cattle-such as collagen and gelatin-for prion contamination.
