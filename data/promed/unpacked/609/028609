Scientists who investigated blood-feeding bat flies found no evidence that the insects have a primary role in spreading Australia's dangerous Hendra virus. Researchers, in a short communication in the journal Zoonoses and Public Health [see item [2] below], noted that while Australian native fruit bats have been identified as reservoir hosts, the precise way in which the virus is spread had yet to be explained.

Miranda Vidgen and her colleagues said there had been limited investigation of the role of blood-feeding insects as vectors of the virus. Such research, they said, was particularly relevant because of the blood-feeding parasite known as bat flies. The researchers, using molecular detection methods, screened for Hendra virus RNA in 183 bat flies collected from flying-foxes in a Queensland roost.

It was later shown that, during the study period, bats in the colony had a Hendra virus RNA prevalence of between 2 percent and 15 percent.

The scientists found no evidence of Hendra virus in any of the bat flies tested, including 10 collected from bats in which they had detected Hendra virus RNA. "Our negative findings are consistent with previous findings and provide additional evidence that bat flies do not play a primary role in Hendra virus transmission," the study team reported.

The researchers were affiliated with the Queensland Centre for Emerging Infectious Diseases and the state government's Department of Health.

Summary
-------
Hendra virus (HeV) causes potentially fatal respiratory and/or neurological disease in both horses and humans. Although Australian flying-foxes of the genus _Pteropus_ have been identified as reservoir hosts, the precise mechanism of HeV transmission has yet to be elucidated. To date, there has been limited investigation into the role of haematophagous insects as vectors of HeV. This mode of transmission is particularly relevant because Australian flying-foxes host the bat-specific blood-feeding ectoparasites of the genus _Cyclopodia_ (Diptera: Nycteribiidae), also known as bat flies.

Using molecular detection methods, we screened for HeV RNA in 183 bat flies collected from flying-foxes inhabiting a roost in Boonah, Queensland, Australia. It was subsequently demonstrated that during the study period, _Pteropus alecto_ in this roost had a HeV RNA prevalence between 2 and 15 percent (95 percent CI [1, 6] to [8, 26], respectively). We found no evidence of HeV in any bat flies tested, including 10 bat flies collected from _P. alecto_ in which we detected HeV RNA. Our negative findings are consistent with previous findings and provide additional evidence that bat flies do not play a primary role in HeV transmission.
