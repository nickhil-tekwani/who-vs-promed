Health officials and doctors are holding a series of meetings to discuss
the issue of the yaws infection of people in New Ireland [Papua New
Guinea. The outbreak, believed to have affected more than 1,000 people,
was reported last week in this paper.
According to Peter Bale, the New Ireland provincial disease controller, the
epidemic had spread from Taskul and Djaul Island to the mainland in the
Lemakot and Kaut villages in northern New Ireland and to the southern tip
of the province.
Dr. Joachim Taulo from the Kavieng health division said he disputed the
term epidemic in relation to the outbreak of yaws as there were no
statistics to prove it. "The sources are not painting the true picture.
They are false reports and the severity will only be known when dispatched
officers return with the information," he said. Dr. Taulo confirmed funding
was a factor that contributed to slowness and they had taken the hospital's
degree of severity higher than that of last month [?.
All doctors in the province have been alerted in case it becomes an
epidemic.
New Ireland Administrator Lima Dotaona disputed the reported numbers of
those infected and said more information would be given when the numbers
had been verified.
