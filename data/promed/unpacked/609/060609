[1] WHO update
Date: Mon 11 Aug 2014

Ebola virus disease update -- West Africa
--------------------------
Between 7-9 Aug 2014, 69 new cases (laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases) of EVD and 52 deaths were reported from the 4 countries as follows: Guinea, 11 new cases and 6 deaths; Liberia, 45 new cases and 29 deaths; Nigeria, 0 new cases and 0 deaths; and Sierra Leone, 13 new cases and 17 deaths.

[The table in the source gives confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths from Ebola virus disease in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone, as of 9 Aug 2014, and shows Total Cases 1848, Deaths 1013. On 10 Aug 2014, Nigeria reported one more death; see [2] below. - Mod.JW]

The recent treatment of 2 health workers, who were infected with EVD, with an experimental medicine has raised important questions about whether medicines or treatments that have never been tested or shown to be safe in humans should be used in this outbreak. Currently, quantities of the medicine are limited, which also raises questions about who should receive the treatment.

On 11 Aug 2014, WHO convened a panel of medical ethicists, scientific experts, and lay people from the affected countries to assess the role of experimental therapies in the Ebola outbreak response; 2 issues were considered:

1) Is it ethical to use unregistered interventions with unknown adverse effects for possible treatment or prophylaxis? If it is, what criteria and conditions need to be satisfied before they can be used?

2) If it is ethical to use these unregistered interventions in the current circumstances, then what criteria should guide the choice of an intervention and who should receive priority for treatment or prevention?

[The findings of this panel have been posted on WHO's website http://www.who.int on Tue 12 Aug 2014 -- see Summary on ProMED archive 20140812.2682604. - Mod.JW]

The total number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and availability of laboratory results. Data reported in the Disease Outbreak News are based on official information reported by the Ministries of Health.

[3] Nigeria: 10th case
Date: Mon 11 Aug 2014
Source: Agence France-Presse in Lagos [edited]


Nigeria has confirmed a new case of EVD in the financial capital, Lagos, bringing the total number of people in the country with the virus to 10.

The health minister, Onyebuchi Chukwu, said the latest confirmed case was a female nurse who came into contact with a Liberian-American man, PS, who died of EVD in a Lagos hospital on 25 Jul 2014. Another nurse who had contact with him died last week, while 7 other people have been confirmed to have the virus in the city, he added.

The 10th case actually was one of the nurses who also had primary contact with the index case. When he [PS] got ill, we then brought her into isolation," the minister told a news conference in Abuja. "We just tested her over the weekend. So, that's what made it 10. So, between Friday and today [8-11 Aug 2014], we had one additional case. That brings it to 10, and the 10 include the index case." Chukwu said the nurse was undergoing treatment and her husband was under surveillance.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday [8 Aug 2014] there were 13 probable and suspected cases of Ebola, including 2 deaths, in Nigeria. The minister did not comment on the discrepancy in the figures.

[4] USA: Ebola virus disease paranoia
Date: Sun 10 Aug 2014
Source: Avian Flu Diary [edited]
http://afludiary.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/a-look-down-ebola-rabbit-hole.html


[At the end of a long debunking of YouTube videos forecasting the end of the world with the eruption of the Yellowstone "supervolcano" in the USA is the following comment]:

[M]any of those [EVD videos] on the paranoid end of the scale were receiving extensive views, some as many as 10 000 a day. ... These are the same internet scare tactics that have been successfully used by some activists to demonize childhood and flu vaccines. For their core audiences, their messages strongly resonate, and their impact shouldn't be underestimated. It is against this background of distrust that any public health campaign against future disease outbreaks must be waged. For every CDC statement rationally explaining why EVD is unlikely to spread efficiently in the Western world, there are a hundred videos screaming "cover up." ... The bad news is that 35 percent of those polled still ranked [CDC] as "only fair" or "poor," leaving more than a little confidence gap.

Just as fear, distrust, and superstition have greatly interfered in the identification, isolation, and treatment of EVD cases in West Africa, one has to seriously wonder just how much differently things would play out in [the USA] should EVD, MERS, or avian flu ever seriously threaten. Here's hoping we never find out.

Cote d'Ivoire travel ban
-------------------------
Ivory Coast has not reported any cases of Ebola, and government spokesman Bruno Kone said they want to keep it that way. The government said in addition to the ban on flights, authorities at the Abidjan airport will be screening all arriving passengers for fever, using infrared thermometers. Ivory Coast's defense minister said in recent days that border authorities have already repatriated "nearly 100 people" who have tried to cross illegally from Guinea or Liberia. The Ivory Coast government said it continues to train health workers and will be holding a simulation drill later this week for 1st responders.

Cyprus prepared
------------------
10 Aug 2014: Health Ministry: Cyprus has taken all measures against Ebola virus disease. Furthermore, instructions have been given to ports and airports on how to recognise symptoms and deal with such cases. Cyprus has fully complied with World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations concerning the ebolavirus, and its action plan to address the disease is ready to be activated if necessary. ... Regarding the Turkish occupied areas of the Republic, the Ministry of Health says there appears to be no danger from travellers, who are mainly Turkish Cypriots crossing the ceasefire line, and that no suspicious cases of disease have emerged. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health is in close contact with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding measures that must be taken on both sides, and the government's action plan has been conveyed to the Turkish Cypriot side.

Rwanda: suspected case improving
----------------------------
Following Sunday's report [10 Aug 2014] of a patient who was identified in Rwanda with EVD-like symptoms, the ministry of health has announced that the patient's condition is improving. The patient, a European medical student who has recently been in West Africa, was put in isolation while at King Faisal hospital with malaria when he developed EVD-like symptoms. He is currently in the isolation facility in Kanombe while doctors wait for the results of medical tests to determine whether the man is actually infected with the hemorrhagic fever. On Monday [11 Aug 2014], however, Minisante [Ministry of Health] reported that the patient's temperature had significantly gone down and that he is recovering well from the malaria and other symptoms.

The red to brownish color of urine due to hemoglobinuria can be misinterpreted as blood in the urine (hematuria). - Mod.ML]

South Africa: thermal scanners
---------------
10 Aug 2014: South Africa announced on Thu [7 Aug 2014] that it was in the process of outfitting airports with thermal scanners to detect feverish passengers. In many ways, it's a repeat of 2009, when airports around the world brought in thermal scanners to look for passengers who were presenting with fever and suspected bird flu.

Twitter Analytics Project HealthMap Outperforming WHO in EVD Tracking
--------------------------------------
10 Aug 2014: HealthMap, a collaborative data analytics project launched in 2006 between Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital, has been quietly tracking the recent EVD outbreak in Western Africa with notable accuracy, beating the World Health Organization's own tracking efforts by 2 weeks in some instances. HealthMap aggregates information from a variety of online sources to plot real-time disease outbreaks. Currently, the platform analyzes data from the World Health Organization, Google News, and GeoSentinel, a global disease tracking platform that tracks major geography changes in diseases carried through travelers, foreign visitors, and immigrants. The analytics project also got a new source of feeder-data this February [2014] when Twitter announced that the HealthMap project had been selected as a Twitter Data Grant recipient, which gives the 45 epidemiologists working on the project access to the "fire hose" of unfiltered data generated from Twitter's 500 million daily tweets. ...

Suspected imported cases
--------------------
Many locations are testing people who have travelled to countries with EVD and return with a fever and other symptoms. So far, none of these have proven to be EVD. International SOS is monitoring these closely.

Bangladesh: Media sources have reported that an alert has been issued in the country as a response to the EVD situation in West Africa. Officials plan to enhance monitoring for 90 days at the airports in Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet and at the seaport at Chhittagong. A medical facility has been identified for isolation and treatment of suspected EVD patients in the outskirts of Dhaka.

Benin: 7 August 2 cases, one in Cotonou, who travelled from Nigeria and the other in Porto-Novo - tests sent to Senegal.

China (Hong Kong): A traveller arriving from Lagos, Nigeria on 9 August, has tested negative for EVD on 10 August.

Germany: A traveller from Sierra Leone who was quarantined has tested negative for Ebola.

Ghana: 4 suspected cases reported, in isolation at Nsawam Government hospital in the Eastern region. Test results from all 4 suspected cases are negative. Ghanian Ministry of Health has issued a red alert in the country over EVD. Health officials have urged citizens to avoid using public swimming pools, practise and maintain strict hygiene.

[When I worked for the New York State Health Dept., I personally observed that after a child vomited in a public swimming pool it was closed, emptied and cleaned before refilling. - Mod.JW]

India: 9 August A traveller from Guinea, kept under observation at a government hospital in Chennai, found healthy. Officials will monitor his health.

Iran: The Ministry of Health has issued a travel warning for its citizens against travelling to EVD affected countries.

Liberia: News sources are reporting that the Liberian army has put a 3rd province, Lofa county, under quarantine. According to the President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf "we want to protect areas that have not been yet affected." Boma and Grand Cape Mount counties, the most northern affected counties, were quarantined earlier.

Mexico: 7 August The Ministry of Health advises that there are NO EVD cases, and news reports of a suspected case are false.

Nigeria: News sources have reported that officials have banned the transport of corpses within the country. Other sources mention that wildlife hunting and other recreational activities have also been banned [in some areas]. They have also reported another case in Lagos, a nurse who was involved in caring for the 1st case [the man from Liberia].

Romania: A traveller who returned to the country from Nigeria on 25 July [2014] is in isolation at a hospital in Bucharest. The man's wife and son have placed themselves under voluntary quarantine at home but do not have any symptoms. Results are awaited.

Saudi Arabia: One suspected case detected 5 August, proved to be negative on 9 August. Over 7000 visa requests for Hajj from Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia have been turned down in a bid to contain EVD spread, as per media sources. Saudi embassy officials are awaiting communication from the WHO on the pilgrims from affected countries travelling for Hajj.

Senegal: A traveller from Liberia, hospitalised in Dakar 9 August, tested negative for EVD on 10 August.

Spain: 12 Aug 2014: "Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, who was infected with ebolavirus, has died from the virus, hospital in Madrid says." -- CNN <www.cnn.com>.

[It is not clear whether the serum actually did the 2 Americans any good. One patient started recovering within an hour, too soon to be true, and the other showed no effect - see ProMED archive 20140807.2669718, and was given a 2nd dose. - Mod.JW]

Sudan: Authorities have started implementing precautionary measures at Khartoum airport for passengers arriving from EVD affected countries. New sources report that health care workers have been placed at border areas and have initiated awareness campaigns by distributing health materials.

USA: Missionaries returning home to North Carolina after working with infected cases of EVD in West Africa will be placed under quarantine. Media source reported that the cases will be quarantined for 3 weeks from the last exposure to an infected case. This is been done out of an abundance of caution. Currently, the 2 positive cases of Ebola under treatment in the country are from North Carolina based aid groups.

Zimbabwe: Unverified sources are reporting that all travellers arriving at the Harare International Airport from the EVD affected countries are being monitored, probably for a 21-day period.
