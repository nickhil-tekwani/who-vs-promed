Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 2 Dec 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On [1 Dec 2013] WHO was informed of an additional 3 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the United Arab Emirates.

The 3 cases belong to a family in Abu Dhabi -- a mother (32 years old) who died 2 Dec 2013*, father (38 years old), and son (8 years old). The earliest onset of illness was [15 Nov 2013]. The father is in critical condition in hospital. The mother and father had no travel history, no contact with a known confirmed case, and no history of contact with animals. While hospitalized, the mother gave birth to a newborn child. The 8-year-old son, who has mild respiratory symptoms, was detected from epidemiological investigation of family contacts, and is being kept in hospital isolation. Further investigations into close contacts of the family, the newborn baby, and healthcare workers are on-going.

Additionally, 2 previously laboratory-confirmed cases from Qatar died on [15 and 21 Nov 2013]**.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 163 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 71 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers, and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.

[2] UAE: media report

A man, his pregnant wife, and their 8-year-old son have tested positive for [MERS-CoV] in the United Arab Emirates, the World Health Organization announced Monday [2 Dec 2013].

The woman, who was 8 months pregnant when she contracted the virus, gave birth by emergency [Caesarean] section to a healthy baby boy. But later Monday [2 Dec 2013], the National, an English-language newspaper in Abu Dhabi, reported that the woman had succumbed to her illness.

This is the 1st known case of a pregnant woman contracting MERS-CoV.

The man remains in critical condition in hospital. The older son had a milder illness; he was only spotted as a MERS patient when health officials screened the relatives of the couple for additional cases. The boy is reportedly being kept in isolation.

The latest cases are members of a large extended family from Jordan who were residents of the UAE. News reports from Abu Dhabi said the couple had recently travelled to Saudi Arabia and noted UAE health officials have speculated they may have been infected there.

But the WHO said it was not informed of any recent travel by the couple. As well, it said the family had no recent contact with animals.

The Geneva-based global health agency also announced Monday that the experts who advise it on MERS, the so-called emergency committee, will meet again this Wednesday [4 Dec 2013].

Dr Theresa Tam of the Public Health Agency of Canada is a member of the emergency committee. Tam is the agency's director general of the centre for emergency preparedness and response.

The emergency committee, which has met 3 times previously, notified the WHO after its last meeting that it wanted to reconvene after the annual Hajj to assess the state of the outbreak. This year's Hajj was in mid-October [2013].

The Hajj draws several million religious tourists to the holy sites of Saudi Arabia, which has had more cases than any of the other MERS-affected countries. There had been serious concerns mass pilgrimage might result in spread of the virus to other parts of the world.

But so far only 2 Hajj pilgrims -- women from Spain who travelled together -- have tested positive for the virus. And at the moment both those cases are designated probable, because tests done by Spanish laboratories have only met part of the WHO's criteria for a confirmed case.

The WHO says with the new cases in the UAE there have now been 163 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS infection. If this latest death is confirmed, the number of fatal cases will rise to 71.

[According to the revised WHO statement, there have now been a global total of 163 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 71 deaths. The 2 additional probable cases returning to Spain following pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia that were announced in the media have still not been confirmed according to WHO criteria.

Of note, while there is mention of no evidence of infection in the infant delivered through Caesarean section, repeated testing will be necessary to fully rule out the possibility of transplacental infection.

In the media report above, there is mention of the conflicting reports on possible travel of the affected family prior to onset of illness. According to official reports, there was no history of travel during the presumed incubation period, whereas the media report, and prior media reports on these cases there was mention of a history of travel to Saudi Arabia during the incubation period. There have been other cases occurring in the UAE without a history of travel during the incubation period, so it does appear as though whatever the means of transmission of the MERS-CoV was in this instance, the risk of transmission most likely does exist in Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, and the UAE, and possibly Kuwait (there were 2 reported cases from Kuwait but travel histories are not mentioned in the report).
