Today [30 Aug 2015], local newspapers gave some details of a possible intoxication due to tuna fish consumption for all members of a family of 5.

All members of the family developed nausea, vomiting, and rash after eating tuna fish. All recovered after being treated at the local hospital.

Data provided are scarce, and I hope to gather more information as the head of the only food hygiene university laboratory in central Italy. Unfortunately, the actual system in Italy no longer involves close collaboration between local health services and the university but only with the local state veterinary laboratories (the so called IZS) http://www.bastiaoggi.it/cronaca/famiglia-intossicata-da-tonno-a-bastia-umbra-tutti-in-ospedale-19739/.

[ProMED-mail thanks Prof. Beniamino Cenci-Goga for this firsthand report, a report from someone close to the situation, and we are currently hoping for further lab testing confirmation or more information. In the meantime, this timely report is suggestive of scromboid toxicity.

"What is scombroid fish poisoning?
Scombroid fish poisoning is a syndrome resembling an allergic reaction that occurs within a few hours of eating fish contaminated with histamine. There are no specific diagnostic tests for scombroid fish poisoning in humans, and diagnosis is generally made based on symptoms and recent dietary history.

What are the symptoms of scombroid fish poisoning?
Illness typically begins minutes to hours after ingestion of the toxic fish and resembles a histamine reaction. Associated symptoms include tingling and burning sensations around the mouth, facial flushing and sweating, nausea and vomiting, headache, palpitations, dizziness and rash. Some patients report that the implicated fish has a peppery or a metallic taste.

How do people get scombroid fish poisoning?
Fish in the Scombridae family (tuna, mackerel, skipjack and bonito) are the most common vehicles for scombroid fish poisoning. Other fish, however, have been implicated in scombroid fish poisoning, and include mahi mahi, bluefish, marlin, and escolar. When susceptible fish are not promptly and continuously refrigerated, bacteria can metabolize naturally occurring histamine to produce scombrotoxin, which consists of histamine and other amines. The presence of 50 parts per million (ppm) or more histamine in fish is indicative of decomposition whether or not there is gross evidence of spoilage, such as bad odor. When illness results from consumption, histamine levels in implicated fish have commonly been at least 200 ppm and often greater than 500 ppm. Histamine is heat resistant and can, therefore, cause illness even when fish is properly canned or cooked thoroughly. While some contaminated fish will not show any outward signs of spoilage, others will show such signs as a bad odor. Cooked fish that has spoiled may have a "honey combed" appearance.

How is scombroid fish poisoning treated?
Scombroid fish poisoning is usually mild and duration is short, making treatment unnecessary. For more severe cases or inpatients with underlying medical conditions, oral antihistamines may be beneficial.

How common is scombroid fish poisoning?
The occurrence of scombroid fish poisoning is worldwide. In California, scombroid fish poisoning is reportable; in 1999 and 2000, there were 17 and 26 cases of scombroid fish poisoning reported in California, respectively."
