5000 hectares, about 15 percent, of Catanduanes' abaca plantations are either dead or drying from the incurable Abaca Bunchy Top Disease (ABTD), raising fears that it could wipe out the industry in a few years' time if not eradicated.

The Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA) reported that anywhere from 1% to 40% of the total abaca area in all towns are affected by the disease. The disease incidence is adversely undermining abaca productivity and sustainability.

In Caramoran area around 50% of the plantations are already affected, in San Miguel [area] 70% of the abaca area is diseased, with the industry facing destruction in three years' time if not acted upon by concerned agencies. "We cannot afford to let this menace destroy our number one agricultural product," [a provincial board member] stressed. "This is not good for the entire abaca industry and for the local economy."

PhilFIDA clarified that an effective Abaca Disease Management Program, conducted alongside local government units, has been in place. [They] said there is no cure for the bunchy top disease, and the only way to manage it is to kill the diseased plant.

[Bunchy top disease (BTD) of abaca (_Musa textilis_) can be caused by _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) or _Abaca bunchy top virus_ (ABTV). The related viruses (genus _Babuvirus_, Nanoviridae) only affect species and hybrids of genus _Musa_ which represents wild and cultivated bananas, including eating bananas, plantains, cooking bananas and the fibre crop abaca. BTD is one of the most serious diseases of cultivated _Musa_ with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting and death of the host plant.

The viruses are both transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on plant material or by air currents. The viruses are also spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools). Disease management is extremely difficult and may include vector control, removal of inoculum, use of clean planting material and frequent scouting for new outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV or ABTV from a planting or natural cluster of plants is considered impossible, and the only option is to kill off all plants in the group. Tolerant varieties, used to enable some banana production in infected areas, may still support virus replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

In the Philippines, transporting abaca planting material off Catanduanes island has been decreed a crime punishable with imprisonment and heavy fines, due to the risk posed by BTD and other banana viruses (ProMED-mail post 20091113.3926). However, BTD is also present in other parts of the country (e.g. see ProMED-mail post 20170718.5185031).

Grateful thanks are due to Dr. J. Thomas, University of Queensland, for the following additional information:
ABTV and BBTV both cause the same disease symptoms in both hosts (banana and abaca). It appears that BBTV is the more common virus in both hosts, although specific surveying for ABTV is only just now being done in the Philippines. The vast majority of reports on the disease from the Philippines just refer to the host and do not actually identify the virus involved. Thus, most reports of bunchy top disease on abaca will be said to be abaca bunchy top virus (regardless of whether ABTV or BBTV is the cause). Similarly for banana where it will be described as banana bunchy top virus (regardless of whether ABTV or BBTV is present).
