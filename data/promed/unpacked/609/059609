Russia battles fresh foot-and-mouth disease outbreak
----------------------------------------------------
More than 10 000 pigs are to be culled after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in one of Russia's main pig production regions.

Vets decided to cull all livestock on a farm in [Primorsky krai (Primorye)], in the far east of Russia, after more than 4000 animals showed signs of the disease and more than 2500 died.

Officials said they were culling all the animals because the disease had spread so quickly among livestock since being confirmed last week (21 May 2014). Sergei Sidorenki, the region's vice-governor, said the infected animals were initially going to be treated, but more extreme measures were needed to contain the disease.
"When the virus first hit the complex there were 13 448 pigs of different ages," he said. "More than 2500 animals have died and we are continuing to see new signs of pig mortality. We previously considered a treatment option [see comment], but it increases the possibility that infection could get beyond the farm's territory," he added. [That is why] we decided to destroy all the livestock."

Officials said the farm would be put under quarantine for 3 weeks before being disinfected. The unit could then be restocked after 2 months.

A large-scale vaccination of other livestock in the region will be carried out over the next few days in a bid to contain the disease, they added.

Primorye is one of Russia's most significant pig-producing areas, with plans for a 500 000-head pig production "cluster" unveiled earlier this year [2014]. The USD 1 billion project, which aims to increase pork production by 80 percent, increase exports to Asia, and increase self-sufficiency in the region, includes 6 pig farms, a feed mill, and a genetics centre. The development also includes 7000 ha [1730 acres] of arable land to produce more than 185 000 tons of soya bean and corn for animal feed.

[Russia's immediate notification to the OIE on this event was included in ProMED-mail's posting 20140521.2488506.

According to the OIE report, the affected farm included 6780 susceptible pigs, among which there were 4070 "cases"; no mortality or culling were reported.

An OIE report of the previous FMDV serotype O outbreak in Primorye, March 2012, (ProMED-mail posting 20120312.1068385), included the following epidemiological commentary:

"Russian Far East Federal District [Primorsky Krai/Primorye]. Foot and mouth disease virus was detected on a private farm in the village of Usachevka in a remote south-east corner of the country. The outbreak affected 7 cows from 240 cattle heads and 22 small ruminants. The source of the outbreak is currently unknown. The village of Usachevka is located at 45 km [30 mi] from the border between Russia and China. Primorsky krai is part of the buffer zone where cattle and small livestock are vaccinated against foot and mouth disease on an annual basis. All necessary measures to curb the outbreak and prevent the spread of the disease are being taken. According to nucleotide sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis, the isolate belongs to type O PanAsia genetic lineage and is genetically close to the isolates involved in the FMD outbreaks in China and Eastern Kazakhstan in 2011."

For an updated genotyping report addressing Russian FMDV strains, and a map, please go to page 10 of "WRLFMD Quarterly Report January-March 2014" available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/ref_labs/ref_lab_reports/OIE-FAO%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Report%20Jan-Mar%202014.pdf.

Genotyping results of the current O strain in Primorye are expected.
