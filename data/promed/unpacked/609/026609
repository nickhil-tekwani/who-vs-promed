Officials say another case of bovine tuberculosis (TB) has been detected in Michigan's northeastern Lower Peninsula.

The disease recently turned up in a medium-sized beef cattle herd in Alpena County.

Assistant State Veterinarian Dr. Rick Smith says was the latest of 3 herds in Michigan that tested positive in 2015. It's also the 63rd cattle herd found to carry the illness since 1998. Of those, 28 have been in Alpena County.

The infections were found during routine testing by the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).

A meeting for area cattle producers is scheduled for [21 Jan 2016] in Lachine.

Bovine TB is an infectious disease that primarily affects cattle but can be spread between different mammals. Many whitetail deer in northeastern Michigan are carriers.

[Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease of both animals and humans. It is caused by 3 specific types of bacteria that are part of the _Mycobacterium_ group: _M. bovis_, _M. avium_, and _M. tuberculosis_. Bovine TB, caused by _M. bovis_, can be transmitted from livestock to humans and other animals.

TB can be passed to a herd by infected cattle, cervids, swine, and humans. It is spread through the inhalation of TB bacteria aerosols, through feed or watering sites contaminated with saliva and other discharges, or by drinking raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals. The risk of exposure is greatest in enclosed areas, such as barns with poor ventilation.

TB is difficult to diagnose with clinical signs alone. In the early stages of TB, clinical signs are not visible. In later stages, clinical signs may include: emaciation, lethargy, weakness, anorexia, low-grade fever, and pneumonia with a chronic, moist cough. Lymphnode enlargement may also be present.

There is also a nationwide surveillance program in slaughter plants. If lesions consistent with TB appear on a carcass, a sample is sent to APHIS [Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service] National Veterinary Services Laboratories [NVSL] for confirmation. The state officials will likely be tracing the movements of animals into and out of this herd in an effort to find the originating herd or herds.
