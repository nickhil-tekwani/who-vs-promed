To answer your questions first, I'm not really familiar with rabies strains
in the Far East, but Smith, Yager and Orciari (1993) (Ondestepoort Journal
of Veterinary Research, 60. 4. 307-314) found that samples from Indonesia
were closely related to others from Thailand; Henry Wilde
<fmedhwl@chulkn.car.chula.ac.th> is very active in dog rabies in Thailand
and would no doubt be an excellent source for comment.
>From the messages, it seems most probable that this is straight canine
rabies and wildlife species play little part, even if there is a wildlife
reservoir. The policy of mass dog-destruction is now questioned in many
quarters - it creates a vacuum which is quickly filled by susceptibles;
when properly costed (either bullet or poison, disposal of carcases etc) it
is often more expensive than vaccination; and probably most importantly, it
is usually totally unacceptable to the public and meets with resistance
rather than the essential co-operation during campaigns.
So much is missing from these articles. Is the (170,000) dog population
correct (human: dog ratio 23:1). Is canine vaccine available? Is
post-exposure treatment available or given? How are the dogs to be destroyed?
Regarding the human survival time, Fishbein (1991) analysed the incubation
periods of 1555 cases which includes all U.S. cases with known incubation
periods between 1960 and 1987 and none died in less than 10 days, 29.8% in
10-30 days, 54.4% in 31-90 days, 14.6% in 91-365 days and 1.2% >365
days.(Fishbein D. B. (1991). In: Natural History of Rabies, 2nd edition.
pp519-549). This does not tie up at all well with Salean quoted "rabies
victims normally die one week after being bitten".

Arthur gave you the current view regarding mass dog killing with which we
here agree. Our patients with encephalitic rabies rarely survive more than
one week unless in the ICU, on a respirator etc. Patients (humans) with GBS
type rabies may live as long as one month with good nursing care. I would
suspect that your survival reports count from the date of the bite. We have
had one documented child with multiple facial bites develop encephalitic
rabies 4-5 days later. Usual is as stated by Fishbein and most of ours
develop disease within one month. In Thailand human deaths have come down
from about 400 per year two decades ago to less than 70 last year. This was
done mostly by provision of good PET [post-exposure treatment with tissue
culture vaccines and RIG and not by dog control. Only way to control dogs is
by mass vaccination. They [in the current financial problems in Indonesia
will probably need help from abroad.
If [the Indonesians can send us some frozen dog and/or human brain tissue,
we can do monoclonal strain analysis. Other places that do this are Henri
Tsiang at Pasteur-Paris and US-CDC Dr. Rupprecht in Atlanta. I suspect
[they have the standard Asian dog strain, which has several sub-variants.
In case ProMED-mail missed it, [we did Dr. Omala Wimalaratne from the Sri
Lanka
Med Research Institute, Colombo reported a rabies FAT positive elephant a
few months ago. We did strain identification here and found it to be the
Asian dog strain. Our local elephant experts suggested that the animal must
have been bitten on its trunk as the skin elsewhere would be too thick for
inflicting a transdermal wound.

[Thanks to Arthur & Henry for their informed comments. In the original
posting some 51 people were reported as hospitalised and three others had
died. With five more deaths, that leaves some 46. It would be of value to
know their outcomes, whether they received PET, and how successful it has
been. - Mod.MHJ
