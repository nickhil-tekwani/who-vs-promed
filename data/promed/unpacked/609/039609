Young man dies of Yellow Fever in the north of Mato Grosso
--------------------------------------------------
The first death due to YF in the last 3 years in
the western Brazilian state of Mato Grosso was
confirmed yesterday [6 Jul 2006]. The death was
in Nova Ubirata, a town 80 km from Sorriso. The
patient�s identity was not disclosed. He worked
as a logger for a logging company and died on 25
Mar 2006, 3 days after seeking medical assistance.
In the last 13 years there have been 20 confirmed
YF cases and 12 deaths in Mato Grosso. According
to the State Department of Health, the patient�s
initial symptoms were mild, with fever and
headache, a case of flu was suspected and the
patient was medicated and sent home.
As his condition deteriorated, he was sent to
Sorriso, as he was bleeding from the gums and
nose. As he was icteric [jaundiced], hepatitis
was suspected; 1 month later yellow fever was
confirmed post-mortem by serology.
After the confirmation, more than 3000 people
over 6 months old were vaccinated against YF in the region.
Mato Grosso is within the endemic area for YF and
cannot let vaccination lag behind. Last year
[2005] 52 500 doses were used in the state.

[Brazil is divided into 3 large areas concerning YF:
- the so-called endemic area, with 12 states,
mostly in the Northern (Amazon) and West-Central regions;
- the so-called transition or epizootic area, a
buffer zone between the endemic area, where YF transmission occurs, and
- the non-endemic area, where there is no YF transmission.
The buffer zone is prone to epizootics and
extends from North to South. YF vaccination is
routine in the endemic and epizootic areas,
offered at 9 months of age with a booster every
10 years. Periodic campaigns are undertaken. As
there is no routine vaccination in the
non-endemic area, travelers or migrants to
high-risk areas sometimes escape vaccination.
In 2003 there were 64 cases and 23 deaths; in
2004, 5 cases and 3 deaths; in 2005, 3 cases and
3 deaths. In 2006, there were only 2 cases up to
now. All cases were of sylvatic yellow fever,
there is no urban transmission and the disease is
cyclic, with increasing number of cases every 5 years � ljs]
