First Australian Thoroughbred Tests Positive for Horse Flu
-----------------------------------------------------
A thoroughbred horse tested positive to an initial test for equine
flu in Australia, the first race horse to be afflicted by the disease
that's brought the nation's horseracing industry to a standstill.
Sydney's Royal Randwick Racecourse was closed to the public and
trackwork canceled after tests showed the thoroughbred may have the
H3N8 equine influenza virus, the Australian Jockey Club said in a
statement today. A second test is being conducted to confirm or
disprove the initial results, the club said in the statement.
The Australian government banned the movement of horses and canceled
races to control the nation's 1st outbreak of the virus, which isn't
usually fatal for animals or dangerous to people. The measures have
paralyzed an industry that generates Aus Dollars 15 billion (USD 12
billion) a year in betting revenue.
90 horses have tested positive for the virus on 19 properties in New
South Wales, the country's most populous state, Ian Macdonald, the
state's minister for primary industries, said yesterday. Test results
are pending on more than 760 horses in quarantine, including at least
5 thoroughbreds, he said.

[The Australians are finding themselves in a most difficult dilemma:
continue their traditional, & until now successful, policy of
non-vaccination, or join the rest of the world and vaccinate their
horses against equine influenza?! In a global-village situation,
keeping an unvaccinated population free of infection -- while almost
all others (except New Zealand) vaccinate -- is a complex
undertaking, to say the least. - Mod. AS].
