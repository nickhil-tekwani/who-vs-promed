The Department of Human Services has been investigating the outbreak of
salmonellosis linked to 2 Turkish restaurants in Brunswick, Victoria,
Australia.
The Department has been advised of over 700 people who believe they have
become ill after eating at the restaurant. To date over 200 people have
been interviewed, with over 173 people confirmed as ill. Interviews are
being carried out using a structured menu-based questionnaire.
_Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium [DT - definitive phage type] 197
has been isolated from dips sampled from the restaurant (egg plant dip and
hummus) and from one fecal specimen collected from a case. Other foods
sampled are still undergoing testing. Further typing is expected back for
other positive salmonellosis cases today, 27 Jan 2005.
The source of the bacterium has not yet been determined, although it is
believed that cross-contamination has played a role in this outbreak.
Both restaurants are subject to a closing order under the Food Act (1984)
and will not reopen until food preparation processes have been demonstrated
to be safe.
