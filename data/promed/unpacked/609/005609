Measles spread in Darfur and eastern Sudan, says Health Ministry
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Federal Ministry of Health has revealed a rise in the number of measles cases to 1472 in Sudan. 25 people have died while 3000 patients are still suspected of carrying the disease.

Dr Nada Ga'far, the director of the Immunisation Administration in the Ministry, warned in a press conference that the measles in 6 states have reached the epidemiological stage: North, West and East Darfur, and Sennar, Red Sea, and Kassala.

At the beginning of this month [April 2015], the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) reported that 1120 measles cases had been confirmed in the country. During the past 3 months, measles has spread across 29 localities in 16 of Sudan's 18 states. The most affected state was Kassala (353 cases, 2 deaths), followed by Red Sea (205 cases, 3 deaths) and North Darfur (140 cases, 12 deaths).

Nearly 8 million children in Sudan to be vaccinated against measles
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sudanese Ministry of Health, in cooperation with UNICEF and national partners, today [23 Apr 2015] launched a massive campaign to immunise 7.9 million children, aged 6 months to 15 years, against the life-threatening disease.

In one of the worst measles outbreaks in Sudan's recent history, which began in the end of 2014, there have been 1730 confirmed cases, 3175 suspected cases and 22 fatalities, UNICEF stated in a news note today.

Of the total number of reported measles cases, 69 per cent are below 15 years of age, including 52 per cent under the age of 5. West Darfur remains the worst affected state, with 441 confirmed cases and 5 deaths. Kassala has had 365 confirmed cases and 5 deaths, while in Red Sea state there have been 263 cases and 4 deaths.

"Measles is a life threatening disease, but one that can easily be prevented with timely immunisation," UNICEF representative in Sudan Geert Cappelaere said. Sudan has one of the highest levels of malnutrition in Africa. 36 per cent of the children are stunted, which is a primary manifestation of undernutrition. For malnourished children, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, ear infections, pneumonia, and severe diarrhoea. "Every girl and boy must be reached, no matter where they live. There are no excuses and no child can be left out."

The campaign will initially target 28 affected localities in 6 of the highest risk states, before expanding to other areas identified as being at risk of an outbreak. In total 96 localities in 16 affected and "at risk" states will be targeted. There are children in conflict zones in South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur who have not received routine immunisation since 2011. UNICEF has called on the warring parties to facilitate humanitarian access, so that these children can be reached.

The campaign is expected to cost approximately USD 13.9 million. UNICEF is appealing to all donors to make funding available to fight the outbreak, which is having a detrimental effect on the lives of children across Sudan and threatens neighbouring countries. UNICEF, the World Health Organization (WHO), and partners are coordinating with surrounding countries to stop this outbreak from crossing the borders.

Florida: 4th measles case confirmed in Treasure Coast
-----------------------------------------------------
The Florida Department of Health today [22 Apr 2015] confirmed a case of measles in an unvaccinated adolescent in Indian River County. The case has recovered. This brings the total cases of measles between Indian River and St Lucie counties to 4. Measles is a serious respiratory disease caused by a virus of the same name. The disease is highly contagious and can spread to others who are unvaccinated.

"Vaccination continues to be the best prevention against measles," said state surgeon general and secretary of health Dr John Armstrong. "Vaccination remains so important for children, adults and families across our state to protect themselves and their communities from this serious and preventable infection."

The department is working with community health care partners and encourages all residents and visitors who have not been immunized to get vaccinated immediately. Vaccinations are available year round through health departments in Florida's 67 counties or your local doctor's office.

People who are particularly susceptible are pregnant woman, infants under the age of 12 months and people who are immunocompromised. Measles is spread through the air by breathing, coughing or sneezing and is highly contagious. When a person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air. The virus can live on surfaces or in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted from 4 days before the rash becomes visible to 4 days after the rash appears. A typical case of measles begins with flu-like symptoms. The symptoms of measles generally begin approximately 7 to 14 days after a person is exposed to someone with measles.

Health District confirms case of measles in Spokane
---------------------------------------------------
Health officials report a confirmed case of measles in Spokane [Washington state]. The last confirmed case of measles in Spokane was in 1994.

Kim Papich of the Spokane Regional Health District tells KHQ that there is a confirmed case of measles in Spokane. The patient went to Franklin Park Urgent Care on [15 Apr 2015], but didn't show symptoms and was not tested for measles. A staff member at Franklin Park Urgent Care told KHQ they closed at 5 pm Tuesday [21 Apr 2015] so they could contact all the patients that were in the office the same day as the patient who tested positive for measles. They also tested all staff and plan on being back open Wednesday morning [22 Apr 2015].

The patient then made 2 trips to Holy Family and was tested a 2nd time. The results were confirmed Tuesday [21 Apr 2015].

Officials are working to identify how the unvaccinated adult was exposed, but there is no indication of recent travel or contact with a known case. The measles is not related to the large national outbreak linked to an amusement park in California.

Before receiving the measles diagnosis, the person was at the Qdoba at 901 S Grand in Spokane from 3 pm to 11 pm on Sunday [12 Apr 2015]. and at North Park Racquet and Athletic Club at 8121 N Division.

A measles case has been reported in Manitoba
--------------------------------------------
A 2nd case of measles has been reported in Manitoba [province]. A Winnipeg woman in her 30s is recovering at home after contracting the virus while travelling in South Africa.

People who were at 3 locations -- Dakota Walk-In Clinic on Saturday, 12 [11] Apr 2015, at 9 am; Victoria General Hospital emergency room on Sunday, 13 [12] Apr 2015, from 6:40 to 11:40 am; and the Victoria emergency room waiting room on Monday, 14 [13] Apr 2015, from 4:19 to 4:41 pm -- could be at risk.

Public health officials have been contacting people who may have come into contact with the woman at those times. Measles symptoms appear 7 to 21 days after exposure, and may include fever, runny nose, drowsiness, irritability and red eyes, as well as small white spots on the inside of the mouth or throat. Public health officials say they will continue to monitor the situation. Where appropriate, people will be offered immunization and asked to restrict their contact with others to reduce the possible spread of measles.

Adults urged to make sure they get anti-measles jabs as cases rise
------------------------------------------------------------------
Cases of measles in the city [Hong Kong] have risen 6-fold since 2012, with around 1/3rd of them infants who had not yet been vaccinated, new government figures show.

While incidence of the disease dropped dramatically after the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1967, reported cases jumped from 8 in 2012 to 38 in 2013, rising again to 50 last year [2014].

Currently children receive the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months, followed by a 2nd dose in Primary One, under the government's childhood immunisation programme. However, pre-vaccination infants younger than one appeared to be vulnerable. Among 123 cases between 2010 and 2015, about 30 per cent were infants.

The government is advising adults, including foreign domestic helpers, to be vaccinated if they have not had any measles jabs before, while parents of children younger than one who travel frequently to the mainland should take extra precautions.

"The mainland offers the 1st dose of measles vaccine at 8 months old and then at 1.5 years. We advise parents to follow the mainland's schedule to receive earlier protection," said Dr Chuang Shuk-kwan, a consultant in community medicine at the Centre for Health Protection. These children would receive a 3rd dose when they entered Primary One in the city.

Another 33 per cent of measles cases over the past 5 years were adults aged 20 or above. More than half of those patients were born outside Hong Kong. Centre for Health Protection controller Dr Leung Ting-hung urged any adult who had not previously been vaccinated to receive the MMR jabs. "Foreign domestic helpers, for example, might not have had high enough doses. We can encourage them [to have extra vaccinations]," said Leung. He said the single-dose measles vaccine in the 1980s might not provide enough protection. Double-dose MMR vaccines were not introduced until 1996.
