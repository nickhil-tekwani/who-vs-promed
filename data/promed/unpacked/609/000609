73-year-old Staten Island woman tests positive for West Nile virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Targeted Ground Spraying to Take Place in Northern Staten Island
- West Nile Virus Also Confirmed in 8 Mosquito Pools on Staten Island and 6
Birds in Staten Island, Brooklyn, and Manhattan
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the Director of the Mayor's Office of
Emergency Management Richard Sheirer joined New York City Health
Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., to announce that a 73-year old woman from
Staten Island has preliminarily tested positive for the West Nile virus.
The State Department of Health will provide additional confirmation over
the next 2 weeks. The individual became ill with symptoms of encephalitis
(muscle weakness, fever, chills, headache, difficultly walking) on 26 Jul
2001 and was admitted to a local hospital on 31 Jul. This is the first
human case of West Nile virus in New York City this year.
Additionally, the detection of West Nile virus in 8 mosquito pools and 2
dead birds in nearby areas will trigger focused ground-based spraying on
Sunday evening, 12 Aug from 10:00 PM to 5:00 AM and Monday 13 Aug from
10:00 PM to 5:00 AM in northern Staten Island. The Health Department will
issue more detailed information about spraying locations imminently.
Dr. Cohen said, "While 2 human cases were detected in Florida earlier this
year, this is the first human case of West Nile virus in New York City.
This case was detected and diagnosed by the Department's active
laboratory-based surveillance program. With this news of the City's first
human case of West Nile virus, all New Yorkers especially the elderly,
should continue to take precautions against mosquitoes. I urge all New
Yorkers to take personal precautions against mosquitoes and to eliminate
areas of standing water around the home where mosquitoes may breed."
Dr. Cohen also announced evidence of West Nile virus in 2 dead crows in
Staten Island, one each in Fort Wadsworth and Mariners Harbor; one dead
crow and one live northern mockingbird in the Dyker Beach and Bushwick
sections of Brooklyn, respectively; and two dead crows in Central Park. The
City Health Department also confirmed West Nile virus in 8 mosquito pools
in Staten Island. Because the density of West Nile viral findings in Staten
Island spraying is planned throughout
northern Staten Island on August 12th and 13th. Spraying will not take
place in other parts of the city at this time.
Dr. Cohen said, "These findings confirm that West Nile virus has now
appeared in all 5 boroughs, and that all New Yorkers, regardless of where
they reside, should take appropriate precautions against mosquitoes. Our
surveillance indicators suggest an amplification of West Nile viral
activity in green areas, such as parks and cemeteries, in northern Staten
Island. In accordance with New York City's Comprehensive Arthropod-borne
Surveillance and Control Plan, the City will use selective ground-based
spraying for adult mosquitoes in northern Staten Island in an effort to
prevent further transmission of the disease to humans."
New York City residents can learn more by calling the West Nile Virus
Information Line at 1-877-WNV-4NYC and by visiting the Health Department
Web site at nyc.gov/health.
For this spraying effort, the City will use Anvil, a pyrethroid-based
pesticide effective for controlling mosquitoes. Anvil is registered for use
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC).
