Brazil: Dengue Fever Outbreak Waning
------------------------------------
The dengue fever epidemic that has killed 50 in the state of Rio de
Janeiro since the beginning of the year is waning, said health
officials on Thu 25 Apr 2002. In April 2684 cases of dengue were
counted, dramatically fewer than the 37 000 tallied in March, Health
Secretary for the state of Rio de Janeiro Mauro Marzochi told
reporters. The February figure hit 41 000. "I would like to say that
we have no epidemic but I want to be sure. I prefer to say that the
epidemic is at an end," he said. He reminded everyone to be alert to
any signs of the disease's return and to continue to eliminate
mosquito breeding grounds. "If we don't the epidemic will return," he
said.
The epidemic affected a total of 149 387 persons in the state, 1365
of whom contracted the hemorrhagic variety, which is the more serious
and sometimes fatal form of the disease. The situation has been
particularly serious in the city of Rio de Janeiro and the
surrounding metropolitan area where 130 000 cases were reported, 1282
of those the hemorrhagic form. At least 43 died.
Last month around 500 000 people [were involved in a campaign to
destroy the breeding grounds of dengue-carrying mosquitos such as
water storage areas and garbage dumps, also targeting cemeteries and
derelict land. The figure included 40 000 health workers, soldiers
and fire fighters and some 460 000 volunteers.

Brazil: Dengue Epidemic Under Control, but Threat Remains
---------------------------------------------------------
RIO DE JANEIRO: The dengue epidemic that claimed 56 lives in Rio de
Janeiro state so far this year is under control, says Brazil's Health
Minister Barjas Negri, but experts and the population fear a new
outbreak. Of 190 634 dengue cases recorded from 1 Jan to 24 Apr 2002,
official figures indicate that 1645 involved the hemorrhagic type,
the most serious [form of the disease. The largest previous dengue
epidemic in Rio de Janeiro was in 1991, with 85 891 cases. The
mortality rate attributed to dengue could rise because investigations
of some deaths have not yet concluded. The number of ill [in Rio in
the first 24 days of Apr 2002 was a relatively low 2684, compared to
37 417 in Mar 2002, reported the Municipal Health Secretariat.
Negri, a federal-level minister, announced late last week the
demobilization of 1300 army and air force troops who participated in
the campaign throughout Rio de Janeiro state to eradicate the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, which transmits dengue. Furthermore, some 1000
members of the Health Ministry staff will return home. They have been
in the Rio area since February to take part in the anti-dengue and
anti-dengue vector offensives. The health campaign also included the
work of volunteers. Some 730 000 people were mobilized for the war
against the disease-spreading mosquito on 9 Mar 2002, a decisive day
for the statewide action.
The sharp reduction in contagion is evident in the smaller numbers of
patients in the hospitals, but is due in large[r part to help from
nature. The months of March and April, usually the rainy season for
Rio de Janeiro, were the driest in recent years. The _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito requires warm weather and stagnant water to reproduce.
Dengue epidemics tend to erupt during rainy summers in tropical
countries, and the number of infected persons naturally diminishes as
the temperature cools and there are fewer mosquitoes.
The high incidence of the disease has left a large portion of the
state's population immunized against dengue virus type 3, cause of
the latest epidemic. The epidemic this year was of predictable
magnitude, said Sergio Arouca, a doctor specializing in public health
and municipal secretary of health for Rio de Janeiro, who earlier
this year warned that there was a lack of preventive measures for
confronting dengue. A year earlier, in Dec 2000, type 3 dengue virus
had been identified in the city, for the first time in all Brazil.
Dengue virus types 1 and 2 had caused the previous major epidemics
[in Brazil. Now there is fear that the same problem will be recur
with dengue virus type 4, which is already present in neighboring
Colombia and Venezuela, and in Ecuador.

Singapore: Habitat Competition, A Potential New Weapon Against Dengue
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: The Environment Ministry is considering breeding
[propagating one of the 2 types of _Aedes_ mosquito that transmit
dengue virus here and to use it as an ally to kill the other. This is
one of the projects that will be carried out by the new Environmental
Health Institute at Science Park 2 in Pasir Panjang Road, that was
launched yesterday (Thu 25 Apr 2002) by Environment Minister Lim Swee
Say. The Institute, which will start off with 24 researchers, 7 of
whom are PhD holders, also hopes to become a reference centre for
research on the disease, with its 5 laboratories each focusing on a
different aspect of the virus. After the launch, the Institute's
deputy head, Dr Ooi Eng Eong, explained why it may resort to the
age-old method of using fire to fight fire. He said: "If one [species
of mosquito is the major transmitter of the disease, then our
control measures should be specifically targeted at the other, so
that it can act as our ally by competing for the same habitat as the
other."
To find out which mosquito should be bred [as the competitor?, the
Institute will test several hundred children entering Primary 1 next
January [i.e. Jan 2003 for dengue-fever antibody and, if present, to
identify the strain [serotype? of the infecting virus. The project
will deal with Primary 1 children because nearly 7 per cent of those
aged between 6 and 10 have been exposed to the virus, compared to 0.8
per cent of those under 5 years old. This difference could indicate
that the children were exposed to the virus when they started going
to school. [The logic of this proposal escapes me. - Mod.CP
Besides this project, the institute will also increase the amount of
research done on dengue and mosquitoes in general, both in the
laboratory and in the field. There are over 50 types of mosquito
here, of which 7 can transmit viruses. [A high containment facility
is available for virus research.
Commissioner for Public Health Wang Nan Chee said that one of the
reasons for the low rates of infectious diseases here is the speed at
which they are tackled. Singapore was declared free of malaria in
1982 and has the lowest dengue rates in the region. The average
number of cases here last year was 46 per week. Mr Wang noted that
dengue rates reach pandemic proportions during an El Nino year, which
brings warmer weather with it. During the last one in 1997, the
number of cases of the disease peaked at more than 100 per week.
Worldwide, up to 100 million people were affected.

Australia: Cases of Dengue Fever in Townsville, Queensland
----------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials have confirmed an outbreak of dengue fever in
Townsville, with 2 cases of the disease reported at Railway Estate.
The Tropical Public Health Unit said yesterday these were the first
locally acquired cases reported in Townsville since April 2001, when
a small outbreak occurred in Mysterton and North Ward.
Public health physician Dr Susan Hills said the cases involved a man
and a woman. The 2 cases were discovered within the last week," Dr
Hills said. "This is considered an outbreak because both patients
have no travel history and the last locally acquired cases were in
April 2001." Dr Hills said neither of the patients had travelled
overseas recently and so it was likely they had acquired the disease
in the Townsville area. She said the outbreak was probably initiated
when an infected person brought in the virus from overseas.
"Unfortunately it appears that there were also dengue mosquitoes
present in Railway Estate at the time," she said. "Having bitten this
infected person, these mosquitoes were then able to carry the virus
to others, triggering a local outbreak." Dr Hills said the cases were
of concern because additional cases were likely with many perhaps
going unreported. She said health officials were "very anxious" to
prevent another outbreak similar to the one that occurred in Railway
Estate in 1992-93, when more than 900 cases of dengue fever occurred.
Queensland Health inspectors and Townsville City Council health
officials yesterday conducted a sweep of houses within a 250m radius
of where the dengue patients lived. Fogging [was carried out also in
the immediate area in the late afternoon. Acting Mayor Ann Bunnell
said 5 Railway Estate premises inspected yesterday morning were found
to have _Aedes aegypti_ breeding sites.
The 2 cases followed confirmation of another case in West End last
week, thought to have been contracted overseas. Townsville's first
recorded case of the season occurred last month, although that was
also believed to have been contracted overseas.

Australia: Dengue Cases in Townsville Not locally Acquired
---------------------------------------------------------
TOWNSVILLE (Queensland): Townsville health authorities are urging
residents to clean up around their homes to prevent the spread of
dengue fever. In Railway Estate 2 cases have been reported, the first
since April 2001; but the last major outbreak, involving over 900
cases, also began in Railway Estate in 1992. Dr Susan Hills, from the
Tropical Public Health Unit, says it is thought the cases stem from a
person who got the disease overseas. "We haven't had any locally
acquired dengue in Townsville for over 12 months, it must have been
somebody that picked up the disease overseas, came back and was
bitten by the mosquitos here that subsequently spread the disease."
