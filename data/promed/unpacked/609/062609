Guangdong woman ill with avian flu
----------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection is investigating an imported case of H9
influenza A infection involving a 47 year old Guangdong woman. She came
down with breathlessness and a cough 26 Oct 2009. She came to Hong Kong for
medical treatment and was admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on 28 Oct 2009.
She is stable and remains in isolation. She had an underlying medical
condition requiring regular medication.

Her family members have been put under medical surveillance. As she was in
Guangdong during the incubation period, the centre has informed health
authorities there and the World Health Organization, the Ministry of
Health, and Macau's health authorities of the development.

H9 influenza A is a mild form of avian influenza. Infection in humans is
rare. This is the 6th time H9 viruses have been found in humans in Hong
Kong. A total of 4 girls and one boy were confirmed to have suffered from
H9 infection in 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2008.

People should avoid contact with live poultry to minimise the chance of
being infected with avian flu.

[Avian influenza H9 virus infection in humans is rare and generally takes a
mild course, except as in the present case where there are underlying
health problems. Furthermore H9 strains are generally classified as LPAI
(low pathogenic avian influenza) agents. Two cases of avian H9 influenza
virus infection in humans have been recoded previously in ProMED-mail, in
1999 and 2008 (see below). In both instances the infecting virus was an
H9N2 strain.
