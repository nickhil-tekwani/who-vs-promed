Another anthrax case in Goulburn Valley
----------------------------------------------------------
A second case of anthrax has been detected in a herd of beef and dairy
cattle at Tatura in Victoria's north, and authorities say it's possible
there'll be more. An 18-month-old steer died 2 weeks ago from the
soil-borne disease in the same area, but Victoria's Department of
Environment says the 2 deaths are unrelated.
George Miller, senior vet with the DNRE, says dry weather similar to the
last outbreak years ago, may have caused the cases.
"Well in a lot of ways now, except for the temperature, is similar to '97,
except for the weather Â­ it was a very dry period. We think then the
animals were around the water looking for a green pick and we think that's
why they picked up the spores then. But we've got no proof of that."

Anthrax scare hits farm
-------------------------------------
A property in northern Victoria has been quarantined after the second case
of anthrax to hit the state in the last 4 weeks.
Victorian Agricultural Minister Keith Hamilton said anthrax was identified
as the cause of death of a 2-year-old heifer on a property near Shepparton.
Mr Hamilton said the property had been quarantined by the Department of
Natural Resource and Environment (NRE) with the infected carcass
incinerated and the remaining cattle on the property vaccinated.
"Those swift actions taken by NRE so far means that there are no
implications to public health or food safety of meat and dairy products
from the area," Mr Hamilton said.
This is the second case of anthrax in the last 4 weeks, and the second in
Victoria for 4 years.
A property in nearby Tatura was quarantined late last month following the
death of an 18-month-old steer.
As a preventative measure, vaccination will be undertaken on all properties
where anthrax was confirmed in a previous outbreak in 1997 and on any
properties adjacent to this latest case, he said.
Mr Hamilton said early detection was the key to any disease outbreak and
urged farmers to report any cases of sudden unexplained cattle deaths to
their private veterinarian or NRE Animal Health staff.

[A constant meteorological observation is that anthrax cases follow upon
hot, dry weather. While the reasons are obscure they are believed to
reflect pasture grazing being restricted to low-lying sites at higher risk
for soil contamination (spores get washed into these areas from elsewhere
in the field), the dry weather increases the opportunities for
scarification of the throat of the grazing/ browsing animals through eating
dry sharp-edged plant feed, and the negative effect of hot weather on
animal "resistance" to infection. Logically, if more cases are expected,
now is the time to initiate area herd vaccination. - Mod.MHJ]
