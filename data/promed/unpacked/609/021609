In Tomsk, there is a significant incidence of enteroviral meningitis. The infectious diseases departments of urban hospitals do not have enough beds.

According to TB2[?], on Wednesday [29 Wed 2015?] 28 patients with suspected meningitis were seen at a clinic in Tomsk. In the 2nd medical unit, 54 patient beds (45 in the clinic of Simbirtseva), 80 patients, and a 3rd city hospital with 76 patients were crowded, being treated for the infection, despite the fact that the latter is designed for 70. Doctors have had to organize extra beds.

It is reported that among the many sick children, meningitis is recorded in children who go to kindergartens number 28 and 51.

Parents and relatives of the patients also reported on overcrowding of those sick with enteroviral meningitis. Doctors have confirmed, however, that they were afraid to talk openly about the outbreak.

Rospotrebnadzor (the Russian federal service responsible for supervision of consumer rights protection and human well-being) could not comment immediately on what is happening and promised to provide information throughout the day.

[There are possibly more than 240 cases of suspected meningitis in this outbreak. Unfortunately, no other data are available on case numbers.

There are many references that tell about an outbreak of meningitis in Tomsk without giving specific figures. Rospotrebnadzor today [28 Aug 2015] put a message on its website:

"Rospotrebnadzor of the Tomsk region reports that, according to the preliminary diagnosis from August [2015], there continued a seasonal rise in the incidence of enterovirus infection, including acute viral meningitis. The beginning of the epidemic in the Tomsk region was caused by warm weather and the premature opening of the bathing season. Also, the main risk factors for the infection are consumption of fruits and vegetables not subjected to careful handling and non-observance of measures of personal hygiene."

[The term "meningitis" means an inflammation of the meninges, which are the tissues that surround the brain and spinal cord. Normally, there are 0 to 5 white cells (all mononuclear cells) per cmm [per cubic millimeter] in the CSF. CSF becomes cloudy when there are more than 500 white cells per cmm. When the CSF is visibly clear, but on laboratory examination the CSF white cell count is 6 to 500 cells per cmm, usually with lymphocytes predominating, the term aseptic meningitis is used.

The most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection, and enteroviruses are common causes of viral meningitis, especially in children during the summer months. However, aseptic meningitis may be caused by other viruses, such as arboviruses, HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, some bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Non-infectious causes include certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and systemic diseases, such as lupus, sarcoidosis, and metastatic cancer.

Most people who get infected with enteroviruses are asymptomatic or have only a non-specific febrile illness. Enteroviruses are most often spread via the fecal-oral route from person to person, through fecal contamination of water or food, or contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Enteroviruses can also be spread through the respiratory secretions (saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an infected person.

Tomsk is a city and the administrative center of Tomsk Oblast, Russia, located on the Tom River in Siberia, with a population of 524 669 in 2010 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomsk). - Mod.ML
