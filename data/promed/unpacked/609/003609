A rare viral disease attacked several municipal traffic police in
Ciudad Juarez, killing one, while 3 have the same symptoms.

The commander of the Eastern sector, Guadalupe Gutierrez Palma, was
reported in critical condition, and 2 more agents are under
observation and have the same disease.

At a press conference, authorities of the municipality, headed by Dr.
Ariel Diaz de Leon, stated that they were puzzled by the unknown
origin and characteristics of the illness.

The disease [illness] was classified by doctors as an atypical
pneumonia. Agents of the City Transit Department and the Health
Department announced that [investigations are in progress] to
determine the cause of the illness responsible for the deaths of the
agents.

The Municipal Secretary of Health said that the [Commander] of
Traffic who died became ill over the weekend and consulted a private
doctor before being transferred to the General Hospital, where he died
despite intensive treatment.

This case was diagnosed as an atypical pneumonia, and the cause of
death is being investigated, he said. Local authority doctors advised
other agents [to seek medical treatment] immediately if they are cold,
experience bone pain, fever or breathing problems.

[Atypical pneumonia is a pneumonia that does not respond to the usual
antibiotic treatment. It can be caused by bacteria, in particular
_Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, _Chlamydia pneumoniae_, _Legionella
pneumophila_ and _Bordatella pertussis_, or viruses, including
influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens.

The description of the illness and the circumstances surrounding this
incident are too ill-defined to suggest a possible etiology for these
4 cases, one with fatal outcome. No information is provided to
substantiate the diagnosis of atypical pneumonia or the involvement of
a viral pathogen or any other infectious agent. Further information is
requested.

Ciudad Juarez is in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It can be located
