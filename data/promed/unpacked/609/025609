HSE warns of measles outbreak in South, Southwest and West
----------------------------------------------------------
The HSE (Health Service Executive) Health Protection Surveillance
Centre (HPSC) is urging parents to make sure that their children are
protected against measles. The call comes following an outbreak of
the disease in 3 HSE regions; the South, Southwest and West. Young
children and teenagers from the Traveller Community are the worst affected.

The HPSC says that measles can be a serious and potentially fatal
illness and children who have not been vaccinated are particularly at risk.

Since January [2009], over 60 cases of measles have been notified
nationally, 12 of whom were hospitalised. This compares with a total
of 55 for all of 2008.

[Traveling communities are always at risk of childhood diseases
because their itinerant way of life excludes them from the normal
pattern of routine vaccinations.
