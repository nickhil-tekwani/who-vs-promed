[1] Cholera - Malawi (Blantyre district)

A cholera outbreak in Malawi's commercial capital, Blantyre, has killed 11 people in the last few months as an acute economic crisis has hit clean water supplies and hospitals have been unable to buy medicines, a health official said on Thu 5 Apr 2012.

Blantyre city health officer Chrissie Banda told Reuters a lack of water and proper sanitation were to blame for 80 percent of more than 200 cholera cases reported since December 2011. "Eleven people have died from cholera in the last 17 weeks, mainly because of persistent water shortages in the city, which has forced many people to drink water from streams and shallow wells," he said.

Nearly 1000 people died from a cholera outbreak in Malawi in 2001/02, the worst recorded outbreak of the disease.

[2] Cholera - Ghana (Accra)

The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has confirmed 11 deaths from cholera in 2 weeks and called for strict adherence to basic hygiene practices to curb spread of the disease in the metropolis. At a press conference in Accra, the AMA Health Director, Dr. Simpson Anim Boateng, said 5 of the deaths were recorded at Maamobi Polyclinic, 2 at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, and one each at 37 Military Hospital, at La Hospital, at Ridge Hospital, and at a private facility.

There have been over 200 reported cases of cholera within the last 3 months in Accra. The press conference comes in the wake of a cholera alert issued by health officials a few weeks ago. The AMA has admitted that poor sanitation in the metropolis was likely to trigger an outbreak of cholera and other water borne diseases.

[3] Cholera - Congo DR

The number of cholera cases this year [2012] in the Democratic Republic of Congo could far surpass the total for 2011. UN officials are calling for an increase in prevention programs in a country where the disease has become endemic.

UN humanitarian spokesman Yvon Edoumou described the cholera situation in the DRC as bleak. "In 2011, we had about 22 000 cases of cholera throughout the country. So far, for the 1st 3 months of 2012, we have just about 8000 cases. So we're looking at already 40 percent of the total caseload that was reported in 2011. At the current rate that we're going, by the end of 2012, we'll be well above the caseload for last year [2011]," he said.

The cholera problem is especially bad in the Eastern DRC. South Kivu is the most affected province with more than 2200 cases. "So far, the numbers are quite high. Just an example: for the whole of last year [2011] in Eastern DRC, we had 150 deaths. So far for this year, we have 77 deaths. I'm talking about Eastern DRC. So we're already at 50 percent of the total number of deaths last year," he said.

For all of DRC, 120 cholera deaths have been reported from January to March 2012.

[4] Cholera - Republic of Congo (Brazzaville)

A cholera outbreak is adding to the woes of thousands of people displaced by a huge munitions blast in the Congolese capital Brazzaville about a month ago, say officials. "We have 10 confirmed cases of cholera," Youssouf Gamatie, the UN World Health Organization's representative in Congo, told IRIN.

Poor hygiene and sanitation conditions in the sites for the displaced as well as ongoing rains have helped spread the disease, which is affecting all age groups, added Gamatie.

The covered market in Nkombo, north Brazzaville and the downtown Sacred Heart Cathedral sites are the worst affected. Together, these places are providing refuge for 11 000 of the 14 000 people who were displaced by the explosions, according to official estimates.

Alexis Elira Dokekias, director-general of health, told IRIN there were 13 suspected cases of cholera with one confirmed case; one person had died.

[5] Cholera - Uganda (Nebbi district)

Two weeks ago, 2 children died of cholera in Panyimur Sub-county, Nebbi District. Now the death toll has risen to 10, while 255 are fighting for their lives.

At Dei Health Centre III, treatment centres have been erected, but the shortage of medical personnel and equipment has made the situation dire.

Due to inadequate room at the facility, pale-looking children and their attendants have been huddled under trees, where bottles of intravenous fluids, fixed on tree branches, are being administered.

Dr Godfred Bwire, an official from Control Diarrhea Disease Department, said the cholera had spread from DR Congo to Nebbi. He said poor waste disposal and lack of pit-latrines are the main reasons behind the outbreak.

"The latrine coverage is very poor. Only 5 out of every 20 households have pit-latrines. The rest of the population defecates in the lake, and others use polythene bags to dispose of waste near water sources," he said.

If you are planning to visit Mysore, ensure that you carry safe drinking water and stick to eating homemade food. The city has reported 34 cases of cholera, said Mysore City Corporation officials on Wed 4 Apr 2012. The Epidemic Hospital is treating the patients.

Health officer Dr Nagaraj said cases have been reported from Metagalli, Kumbarakoppal to Kuvempunagar to Gangotri Layout. He attributed the outbreak of cholera to the poor quality of water supplied in hotels.
