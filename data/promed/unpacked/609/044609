Dr. M. Nagalo, Director of veterinary Service in Burkina Faso has notified
the OIE of 4 outbreaks of sheep pox in the villages of Solenzo, Gama, Bena
and Balave, all in Banwa province.
The outbreaks are thought to be the result of introducing into an existing
flock sheep bought at a subregional week market at Bena.
Agricultural officials have imposed restrictions on animal movements and
contacts. Samples have been forwarded to a laboratory at Bingerville, Cote
d'Ivoire. Vaccines have been ordered.
Morbidity in the outbreaks is 80 percent; mortality is 20 percent. The
diagnosis was made based on clinical signs.
