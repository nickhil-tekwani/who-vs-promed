There seems to be no conflict. The influenza season may have been deadlier,
i.e., a high case-fatality rate,. At the same time, vaccine strains where
coincidental to circulating strains, i.e., vaccinated persons where
protected, and non-vaccinated persons where exposed to a more lethal strain.

There is no real conflict between these statements. The good match between
circulating viral strains and vaccine composition is a perfectly reasonable
observation that says nothing about the virulence of the circulating
strains, the immunogenicity of the vaccine, the extent of vaccine use in a
population, or any other factors that bear on the fatality rate due to
influenza.
One factor is that influenza vaccine coverage is never universal. Aside
from passive noncompliance, there are a variety of reasons people may
decide to not receive the vaccine including hypersensitivity to eggs and
religious conviction. Furthermore, even if the vaccine is given, it may
not be effective in immunodeficiency states such as AIDS.
Another factor is that influenza vaccination is not 100% protective against
disease, although it certainly prevents disease in many individuals, and
there is good reason to believe that it mitigates disease in individuals
who might otherwise suffer a more severe course.
Finally, it should be noted that the data reported by the CDC is "mortality
as a percentage of all deaths", and by this measure it is clear that the
influenza season was deadlier than usual not only this year, but also in
the past several years (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4818a2.htm>). However,
this statistic does not address the case-fatality rate among vaccinated
persons. If this were higher than usual, it would raise doubts about the
quality of the match between circulating strains and vaccine composition.
But I know of no data even suggesting that this years vaccine is
significantly less effective than expected.

Virulence and immunization effectiveness are unrelated issues, so the
reports are not necessarily conflicting. We have no doubt that virulence
felt greater this year than last years. Two other considerations for our
large number of cases: We weren't able to get as many vaccinations out this
year as last, despite intense marketting. Our flu season a year ago was
pretty mild, so I think many of our patients just incorrectly assumed that
they were naturally immune and skipped vaccination. Second our flu season
was later than usual, so levels of protection may have been lower in those
immunized early. However, few of our cases had been immunized, supporting
evidence that the vaccine was effective.

[As seems to be the case for many influenza issues, the cup is either half
full or half empty depending on where you sit. Although many countries have
carefully worked out public health policies to prevent and control
influenza, it is still a leading cause of death in most or all of them.
Because of clinical and epidemiologic difficulties, we do not really know
how many influenza deaths occur annually. In the U.S. we look for
excess P & I mortality trends (excess deaths due to either pneumonia,
influenza, or both) based on death certificates filed in major cities.
Since influenza epidemics often occur during incidence peaks of other
respiratory organisms, and since precise microbial diagnosis is rarely
obtained, let alone entered onto death certificates correctly and in timely
fashion, it is not possible to say how much of the excess mortality is "P"
and how much is "I". [Added: Moreover, as readers astutely note, neither
virulence (nor pathogenicity) are necessarily related to vaccine efficacy,
let alone vaccine use in a population setting. Influenza mortality may be
high even when the best vaccines are available. Under the best of
circumstances, with the optimum usage of the best licensed vaccines, and
optimally matched circulating influenza A and B strains, high excess
mortality occurs every year. This is hardly news in the journalistic sense
of the word. On the other hand, would we tolerate this extraordinarily
high mortality from any other disease? Think of the public and public
health concern over Lyme disease, legionellosis, hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome, or an imported-Ebola scare, none of which have killed, over the
long term, even a fraction as
many people.
As several observers noted, the AP story was essentially hyped. It said
"The U.S. flu season was... deadlier than usual this year..." when it
should have said "every year the U.S. has a flu season, and every year this
flu season is deadlier than usual". Expect the same hype next year too.
