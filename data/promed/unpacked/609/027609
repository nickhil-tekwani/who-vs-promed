An antibacterial-defying strain of the bacterium that causes typhoid fever is gaining a foothold in Pakistan, leading some researchers to warn that it could turn the clock back 70 years, when surviving the disease was more a matter of luck than treatment. In the past 6 months, more than 2000 people in Pakistan have been infected with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhi, according to the National Institute of Health in Islamabad. Only 1 oral antibacterial, azithromycin, works against the XDR strain, and the other options -- expensive intravenous (IV) drugs -- are impractical for widespread use in Pakistan and other low-income nations. _S._ Typhi experts worry that the outbreak could soon spill into other countries.

"This is indeed a really alarming situation," says pediatrician Zulfiqar Bhutta of The Aga Khan University in Karachi, Pakistan. "I'm not sure what can be done, as the horse has bolted. This will jump boundaries before long."

Spread through contaminated water and food, _S._ Typhi causes up to 22 million cases of typhoid fever a year. Early symptoms include high fever, headaches, and stomach pain. Left untreated, typhoid fever can lead to intestinal hemorrhage and perforation of the bowel, and kill up to 15 per cent of infected people. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, about 200 000 people die annually.

Early in 2018, researchers warned that Pakistan was experiencing the world's first outbreak of XDR _S._ Typhi strain, reporting 339 cases that were mainly in Hyderabad, east of Karachi. The strain can't be stopped by the 3 antibacterials most commonly used to treat typhoid fever, or 2 additional classes of drugs used to treat strains resistant to those antimicrobials , they reported on 20 Feb 2018 in mBio. The XDR strain, which has now made significant headway in Karachi and other locales, is "really quite frightening," says Myron Levine, an _S._ Typhi vaccine developer at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore who was not involved in the mBio study. It is only a matter of time, he notes, before it develops resistance to azithromycin, too. If that happens, the remaining effective drugs, carbapenems, require hospitalization and an IV drip; treatment can cost thousands of dollars per patient.

Pakistan began a vaccination campaign in February 2018 using a recently approved formulation that, for the 1st time, works in young children and triggers longer-lasting immunity than older versions. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, is funding the campaign, which aims to administer 200000 doses of the new vaccine. And earlier this month [July 2018], Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a nonprofit based in Geneva, Switzerland, agreed to purchase 10 million additional doses for Pakistan.

Inappropriate use of antibacterials is probably only an indirect cause of _S._ Typhi's acquisition of extensive drug resistance, says Elizabeth Klemm, an infectious disease geneticist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Hinxton, UK, and the first author of the mBio study. Rather, she says, it appears the XDR strain emerged because an existing strain that was resistant to multiple drugs -- probably because of antibacterial overuse -- obtained an additional resistance gene from a plasmid (a circular piece of DNA) likely transferred from _Escherichia coli_, a bacterium common in human waste and polluted waterways.

Pediatrician Anita Zaidi, who heads the Gates Foundation vaccine program and is from Pakistan, says the country's municipal and provincial governments have had difficulty working together to solve sanitation problems. She expects the situation to worsen because "we're now getting into monsoon season, so there's even more mixing of drinking water and sewage."

Rumina Hasan, a microbiologist at The Aga Khan University who was the senior author of the mBio study, says her lab already finds the XDR strain in about one in three blood samples from typhoid fever patients it tests.

Travelers to Pakistan, including 2 from the USA, have already returned home with the XDR strain. This poses little threat of spread in developed countries such as the USA, says Eric Mintz, head of the Global Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Epidemiology team at the US CDC in Atlanta. But in countries that have a weak water and sewage infrastructure, an imported case could trigger an outbreak. "This is a very serious problem," Zaidi says. "If it can happen in one country, it can happen in others."

Klemm EJ, Shakoor S, Page AJ, et al. Emergence of an extensively drug-resistant _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi clone harboring a promiscuous plasmid encoding resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins. mBio. 2018; 9(1): e00105-18. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00105-18; available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5821095/

Abstract
--------
Antibiotic resistance is a major problem in _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates are prevalent in parts of Asia and Africa and are often associated with the dominant H58 haplotype. Reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones is also widespread, and sporadic cases of resistance to 3rd-generation cephalosporins or azithromycin have also been reported. Here, we report the 1st large-scale emergence and spread of a novel _S._ Typhi clone harboring resistance to 3 1st-line drugs (chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) as well as fluoroquinolones and 3rd-generation cephalosporins in Sindh, Pakistan, which we classify as extensively drug-resistant (XDR). Over 300 XDR typhoid cases have emerged in Sindh, Pakistan, since November 2016. Additionally, a single case of travel-associated XDR typhoid has recently been identified in the United Kingdom. Whole-genome sequencing of over 80 of the XDR isolates revealed remarkable genetic clonality and sequence conservation, identified a large number of resistance determinants, and showed that these isolates were of haplotype H58. The XDR _S._ Typhi clone encodes a chromosomally located resistance region and harbors a plasmid encoding additional resistance elements, including the blaCTX-M-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and carrying the _qnr_S fluoroquinolone resistance gene. This antibiotic resistance-associated IncY plasmid exhibited high sequence identity to plasmids found in other enteric bacteria isolated from widely distributed geographic locations. This study highlights 3 concerning problems: the receding antibiotic arsenal for typhoid treatment; the ability of _S._ Typhi to transform from MDR to XDR in a single step by acquisition of a plasmid; and the ability of XDR clones to spread globally.

Importance
----------
Typhoid fever is a severe disease caused by the Gram negative bacterium _Salmonella enterica_ serovar Typhi. Antibiotic-resistant _S._ Typhi strains have become increasingly common. Here, we report the 1st large-scale emergence and spread of a novel extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _S._ Typhi clone in Sindh, Pakistan. The XDR _S._ Typhi is resistant to the majority of drugs available for the treatment of typhoid fever. This study highlights the evolving threat of antibiotic resistance in _S._ Typhi and the value of antibiotic susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing in understanding emerging infectious diseases. We genetically characterized the XDR _S._ Typhi to investigate the phylogenetic relationship between these isolates and a global collection of _S._ Typhi isolates and to identify multiple genes linked to antibiotic resistance. This _S._ Typhi clone harbored a promiscuous antibiotic resistance plasmid previously identified in other enteric bacteria. The increasing antibiotic resistance in _S._ Typhi observed here adds urgency to the need for typhoid prevention measures.
