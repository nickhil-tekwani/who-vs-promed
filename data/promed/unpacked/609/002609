1. Situation update
-------------------
The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Over 1 month into the response, further spread of EVD has largely been contained. However, in spite of the progress made, there should be no room for laxity and complacency until the outbreak is controlled. The focus of the response remains on intensive surveillance, including active case finding, investigation of suspected cases and alerts and contact tracing.

On 20 Jun 2018, 4 new suspected EVD cases were reported in Iboko (2) and Bikoro (2) health zones. 4 laboratory specimens (from suspected cases reported previously) tested negative. Since 17 May 2018, no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case in Iboko Health Zone developed symptoms on 2 Jun 2018, was confirmed on 6 Jun 2018, and died on 9 Jun 2018.

Since the beginning of the outbreak (on 4 Apr 2018), a total of 61 EVD cases and 28 deaths have been reported, as of 20 Jun 2018. Of the 61 cases, 38 have been laboratory confirmed, 14 were probable cases (deaths for which it was not possible to collect laboratory specimens for testing), and 9 were suspected cases. Of the 52 confirmed and probable cases, 28 died -- giving a case fatality rate of 54 percent. 27 (52 percent) confirmed and probable cases were from Iboko, followed by 21 (40 percent) from Bikoro, and 4 (8 percent) from Wangata health zones. 5 healthcare workers have been affected, with 4 confirmed cases and 2 deaths.

The number of contacts requiring follow-up is progressively decreasing, with a total of 1527 contacts having completed the mandatory 21-day follow-up period. As of 20 Jun 2018, 179 contacts were under follow up and all (100 percent) were reached on the reporting date.

2. Actions to date
------------------
Surveillance.
The Ministry of Health, with the support of WHO, CDC, Epicentre, and other partners, continue to maintain an up-to-date EVD outbreak database, including line lists, contact lists, etc.

Operational partnership.
- GOARN Operational Support Team and the AFRO operational partnerships team continue to engage partners in the preparation and response to the EVD outbreak.
- A joint partnership project was initiated by WHO, IOM, IFRC, UNHCR, and other partners to reinforce cross border coordination activities between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo and the Central African Republic.

Laboratory.
- A full mobile laboratory was deployed to Bikoro Reference Hospital on 12 May 2018 and was fully operational by 16 May 2018. A 2nd mobile laboratory is active in Mbandaka and a 3rd one in Itipo has been functional since 30 May 2018.
- A National Laboratory Strategy has been developed, focusing on GeneXpert for confirmatory testing in key sites such as Ebola Treatment Centres (ETC). GeneXpert is now fully functional in Bikoro Health Zone and Mbandaka. Additional GeneXpert machines are being sent to the affected areas. As of 20 Jun 2018, 216 samples have been tested in the different sites, leading to confirmation of 38 EVD cases.

3. Conclusion
-------------
The Ministry of Health and other national authorities, WHO, partners, and the global community continue to closely monitor the EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The situation in Bikoro and Wangata (Mbandaka city) health zones remains stable, with the last confirmed EVD cases reported in mid-May 2018. The situation in Iboko Health Zone, especially remote communities in Itipo health area, is being closely observed while intense response interventions, including active surveillance, continue.

- 22 Jun 2018. More Ebola cases suspected in remote DRC health zones
[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) News, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/06/news-scan-jun-22-2018

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) yesterday [21 Jun 2018] noted 4 new suspected cases of Ebola virus, 2 each in Bikoro and Iboko health zones, yet the number of cases overall remained steady. 4 previously suspected cases tested negative for the virus, so the current total now stands at 61 cases, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 9 suspected.

The death toll remains at 28, and the number of cured patients holds at 24.

Bikoro and Iboko are both remote health zones in the DRC, accessible only by motorcycle in some parts. Officials from the DRC and the World Health Organization (WHO) have said it may take several more weeks to track all known contacts of Ebola cases in these areas.

Also yesterday [21 Jun 2018], the WHO released information concerning a 26 May 2018 panel of experts who met to discuss clinical trial design for testing Ebola therapeutics in an outbreak setting. To meet standards of both safety and efficacy, the experts recommended "a three-arm, open-label, randomized trial to evaluate simultaneously 2 candidate therapeutics."

[2] Searching for contacts
- 21 Jun 2018. On the hunt for Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo
[WHO Regional Office for Africa, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/hunt-ebola-democratic-republic-congo

Marie-Roseline Darnycka BÃ©lizaire is on the front-lines of the battle against Ebola.

She's leading the hunt for the virus in the Itipo area in the northwest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The communities at risk are spread out over a wide area and the roads are bad. Her team of more than 20 field epidemiologists is using mostly motorcycles to get around.
Marie-Roseline Belizaire said "We have to go sometimes as far as 80 km from the coordination base, so in a day we can do 160 km [about 100 mi]."

Today [21 Jun 2018], in the company of one of her field supervisors, Marie-Roseline is looking for a person who is the contact of a confirmed case of Ebola. The person has left his home and has gone to visit relatives in a remote corner of the Itipo area. The ride is dusty and hot.

"The roads are not good so we have to be very careful. We go so slowly so it is as if we are walking, but walking with a motorcycle," said Marie-Roseline. At some point the road is so bad, Marie-Roseline and the field supervisor have to get off the motorcycle and start hacking their way through thick brush.

Marie-Roseline said, "This road is not very well defined. But this is what the supervisor, who knows very well the road, told me to take to reach the contact that we are looking for."

In the end she learns the person she is trying to track down has returned home and she catches up with him in his village closer to central Itipo. She supervises a community agent as he takes the contact's temperature and then double checks if he did it correctly. The contact is grateful for the surveillance team's persistence. Franck (pseudonym) Contact of Confirmed Ebola Case (Lingala) said, "I went away for 4 days. They found me and took my temperature and it was normal."

Marie-Roseline and her team also regularly visit health clinics to check and see if they are getting any suspicious cases of people who have symptoms resembling Ebola.

Tracing and then following all the contacts of confirmed and probable cases of Ebola is vital to controlling the outbreak.

"To end the Ebola outbreak you have to stop the chain of transmission and contact tracing is the only way to stop the chain of transmission," said Pierre Rollin, Ebola Expert, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

WHO along with the Ministry of Health and other partners have managed to rapidly set up an effective surveillance system. When the team arrived on 30 May there were 153 contacts listed for following. 2 weeks later there were 400 contacts listed with 94 percent being regularly monitored.

"I know at the end of the road, I will see somebody and I will keep him safe from Ebola," said Marie-Roseline. "So I have to keep going, whatever the difficulty, I'm facing on the road."
