Large number of goats infected due to the use of an untested vaccine
--------------------------------------------------------------------
According to information provided to "Dnevni Avaz" by a major goat breeder from Mostar, the application of an imported vaccine against _Brucella melitensis_ had resulted in mass illness of an unknown type of goat brucellosis. He said that following the vaccination, he had to euthanize about 1000 goats. He claimed that the vaccine had not been properly tested, that in many herds abortions occurred following the vaccination, and that Croatian colleagues had warned earlier against the use of the vaccine.

[According to B & H's last annual OIE report, during 2011 there have been 35 outbreaks of _B. melitensis_ in the country in small ruminants (sheep and goats). The number of "routine" vaccinations against _B. melitensis_ carried out in sheep and goats during 2010 was, reportedly, 1 184 836.

Informed, professional sources are kindly requested to update us about the validity -- or otherwise -- of the above allegations and, if factual, to add relevant data. - Mod.AS
