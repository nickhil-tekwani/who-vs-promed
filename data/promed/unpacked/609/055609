days. They only found out that their son had contracted bird flu
virus after the hospital [refused to] allow the boy's coffin to be
opened.

Two-year-old boy becomes Egypt's 56th bird flu case
----------------------------
A two-year-old Egyptian boy has contracted the bird flu virus and is
in critical condition, the state-run news agency quoted the Health
Ministry as saying on Sunday, becoming the 56th case in the Arab
country.

The Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted Assistant Health Minister
Nasr el-Sayyed as saying the boy, Youssef Abdel-Azim from the
province of el-Fayoum in central Egypt, showed symptoms on Wednesday
after coming into contact with dead birds.

He was administered the antiviral drug Tamiflu and remains in
critical condition on an artificial ventilator at a hospital in
Cairo, Sayyed said, according to the agency.

Egypt is one of the only countries affected by bird flu that does not
offer compensation for farmers when poultry is destroyed, which many
experts say is the best way to ensure rapid detection of new
outbreaks.

Some 5 million Egyptian households depend on poultry as a main source
of food and income.

Since 2003, the H5N1 avian influenza virus has infected 408 people in
15 countries and killed 254 of them. It has killed or forced the
culling of more than 300 million birds as it spread to 61 countries
in Asia, the Middle East, Europe and Africa.

While H5N1 rarely infects people, experts fear it could mutate into a
form that people could easily pass to one another, sparking a
pandemic that could kill tens of millions and topple the global
economy.
