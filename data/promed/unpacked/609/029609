Nigeria's cocoa harvest is threatened by floods and an outbreak of fungal disease as heavy rains fall in the West African country's main growing regions, the Cocoa Association said. "Just as flooding is threatening the survival of the cocoa trees, excessive rain is boosting the spread of black pod disease." The worst-affected southeastern cocoa belt could lose as much as 40 per cent of its estimated output of 72 000 metric tons of cocoa beans.

Above-average rainfall across Ivory Coast's cocoa growing regions could impact the health of the October-to-March main crop just days before harvests are expected to begin. Farmers said they were satisfied with the number of pods on trees, but worried too much rain would trigger black pod disease by preventing the first cocoa beans from fully drying.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal disease affecting cocoa worldwide. In Africa, the fungus-like pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated with it, but 2 additional species are found in the Americas. _P. palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses as high as 95 per cent in very humid climates, with every pod affected. Pods progressively turn dark brown. Losses are most severe when pods are infected during the 2 months prior to ripening. The disease also causes stem cankers which are estimated to kill up to 10 per cent of trees annually.

Black pod is spread by insect activity, mechanical means, plant debris, water and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations, with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci simultaneously. Genetic resistance is generally low in commercial cocoa cultivars. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach including cultural techniques, phytosanitary measures and targeted fungicide use.

To prevent problems with rain wash-off of foliar fungicides, trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be an effective alternative. However, like chemical sprays, they need to be repeated whenever protection is required. Similar methods are being used in the control of _P. cinnamomi_ diseases in some tree species, for example jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in Australia. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
