As a follow-up to the recent salmonella outbreak linked to peanut
butter, FDA is informing consumers that ConAgra has extended their
recall of all Peter Pan peanut butter and all Great Value peanut
butter beginning with product code "2111", including peanut butter
toppings, back to October 2004. This information was obtained
recently as part of the ongoing investigation being conducted by FDA.
Consumers who have purchased any of the products since October 2004
should discard them. FDA's advice to consumers continues to be not to
eat any Peter Pan peanut butter or any Great Value peanut butter
beginning with the "2111" product code.

[The date this recall went back to has changed twice, from May 2006
to Dec 2005 and now to Oct 2004. The earliest date of onset has
continued to be 1 Aug 2006. The change suggests that the
investigation has found some of the peanut butter or subsequent
products made from it (such as toppings) were produced earlier than
first suspected. - Mod.LL]
