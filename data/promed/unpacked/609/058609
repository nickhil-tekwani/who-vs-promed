[In December 2014, Cyprus reported an outbreak of bluetongue serotype 16 located in Lefkosia [Nicosia]. The event was reported as resolved on 4 Dec 2014. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16699.

Recently, BTV-4 was officially reported in southern Europe (Italy, Montenegro). Also, in a territory closer to Cyprus, namely northern Israel, BTV has reportedly resumed its activity during the past 2 weeks, affecting both sheep and cattle. According to unofficial information, and pending official confirmation, in some of the tested samples BTV-8 has been identified.

For a general overview of the BTV situation in the area, please refer to the "disease outbreak maps" for the dates 1 Jan 2014 to 23 Sep 2016 at http://tinyurl.com/zrgnefq. - Mods.AS/CRD
