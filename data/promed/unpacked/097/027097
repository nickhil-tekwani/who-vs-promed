[1] 5 Ebola cases to date
Date: Sun 17 Oct 2021
Source: Noticias SIN, Agencia EFE report [in Spanish, machine trans., edited]

Among the 3 new cases detected are a 32-year-old woman -- who began to have symptoms on 15 Oct 2021 -- and a 41-year-old man, who was a contact of the 3rd case confirmed today, and a 3-year-old girl who began to experience fever last 12 Oct 2021 and passed away at dawn this Saturday (16 Oct 2021).

The man and the woman remain admitted to the Ebola treatment center in the Butsili area, in Beni, in the northeastern province of North Kivu, where a new case was confirmed on 8 Oct 2021 that marked the outbreak of this disease in the country, after the end of the last epidemic was declared last May [2021].

According to the Congolese Minister of Health, Jean-Jacques Mbungani, the 1st case involved "a 3-year-old male hospitalized and died on 6 Oct 2021."

Likewise, according to the WHO, at least 3 relatives of the minor who also resided in Butsili, died during September 2021 with symptoms typical of Ebola.

On 14 Oct 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a 2nd case, also from a deceased patient, without offering further details.

The DRC launched the immunization campaign last Wednesday [13 Oct 2021] and 14 people were vaccinated during the 1st day, while, until that date, at least 220 contacts whose health status is being monitored had already been identified, according to the WHO reported last Thursday [14 Oct 2021].

"The initial genomic sequencing indicates that the new cases probably represent a new outbreak of the Ebola epidemic of 2018-2020, most likely transmitted by a persistently infected survivor or by a survivor who experienced a relapse," the organization's regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, stressed at a virtual press conference.

Ebola cases in DR Congo rise to 5. I haven't been able to find the story in any of the Congolese media that usually cover Ebola. Excerpt from the Google translation:

With the confirmation today [17 Oct 2021] of 3 new cases of Ebola, there are already 5 people detected with the new outbreak that has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo), 3 of whom died, confirmed today to EFE the national coordinator of the response to the epidemic, Steve Ahuka.

"We confirmed the existence of these 3 cases in the health area of the Beni (territory), which brings the number of registered cases to a total of 5," Ahuka revealed this Sunday in a telephone conversation.

Among the 3 new cases detected are a 32-year-old woman -- who began to have symptoms on 15 Oct 2021 -- and a 41-year-old man, who was a contact of the 3rd case confirmed today, and a 3-year-old girl who began to experience fever last 12 Oct 2021 and passed away at dawn this Saturday (16 Oct 2021).

[The case numbers are inching up, but with the measures being taken -- see UNICEF report below -- one hopes the outbreak will not get out of hand and spread widely.

ProMED also would like to thank Vicki-Hansen Landis for pointing out the 2nd confirmed case was fatal as reported by WHO/AFRO (https://twitter.com/WHOAFRO/status/1448694482979991561?s=20), in response to the question posed on 15 Oct 2021 in ProMED Ebola update (48): Congo DR (NK) 2nd case, origin, aid 20211015.8699049. - Mod.LK]

Situation overview
------------------
- On [8 Oct 2021], the Ministry of Health confirmed that, on [6 Oct 2021], a 3-year-old boy died of Ebola in a health center in the Butsili Health Area (Beni Health Zone), North Kivu Province. Ebola was confirmed after a GeneXpert test was performed by the Laboratoire Rodolphe Merieux -- INRB (National Institute of Biomedical Research) in Goma.
- The swab sample was sequenced, and initial findings indicate that "this outbreak likely represents a new flare-up of the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu/Ituri EVD outbreak, initiated by transmission from a persistently infected survivor or a survivor who experienced a relapse. Epidemiologic investigations are ongoing to determine the source." [See https://virological.org/t/oct-2021-evd-case-in-drc-linked-to-2018-2020-nord-kivu-evd-outbreak/762].
- A new case was confirmed on [13 Oct 2021] in the Health Area of Butsili (Beni Health Zone): a 42-year-old woman who was linked to 3 probable Ebola-related deaths in September 2021. The woman died on [13 Oct 2021].
- As of [15 Oct 2021], 256 contacts have been identified, of whom, 46.7% have reported being vaccinated.
- The Beni Ebola Treatment Center which was operational in 2018-20 remains non-operational at this time. However, 7 temporary isolation units have been set up in different health centers in the Beni Health Zone and at the General Reference Hospital in Beni with a 41-bed capacity for suspected cases

UNICEF's response
-----------------
- Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)/Water, Hygiene and Sanitation (WASH)
UNICEF and partners:
-- Supported the decontamination of 4 households of both the suspected and confirmed cases, this included the replacement of 6 mattresses.
-- Supported the decontamination of a traditional healthcare facility (HCF) where the last confirmed case was being treated in Butsili (Beni Health Zone).
-- Distributed Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) and WASH supplies to 3 HF [health facilities] where the confirmed and probable cases had transited.
-- Trained 72 healthcare workers (HCW) providers on IPC in 15 HCF in the Beni Health Zone

- Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE)
-- UNICEF supported the broadcasting of messages on Ebola prevention measures across 10 local radio stations and distributed 25 posters with alert numbers in the Butsili Health Area.
-- Across the 19 health areas of Beni, 24 Community Action Cells (CACs) supervisors were briefed on the current epidemiological situation and on Community Based Surveillance mechanisms.
-- In support of Community Based Surveillance, 20 CACs' members visited 148 households (578 people including 311 women) and raised 20 alerts for investigation.
-- 10 community dialogue sessions were conducted in the Butsili Health Area on the importance of early treatment seeking for Ebola;
-- 89 one-on-one talks were conducted with patients in health centers on Ebola prevention mechanisms.
-- U-Report: on [10 Oct 2021], an SMS alert was sent to 74 616 U-Reporters in the Beni Health Zone to seek more information on Ebola. This resulted in 27 035 questions submitted to users. In the 1st 3 days, 2565 questions have been responded to.
-- UNICEF's network of 150 youth bloggers has been supported to identify and address fake news circulating online about Ebola and to share reliable information.

- Health and nutrition

[The measures that have been implemented as quickly as they have been are impressive and one hopes will succeed in stomping out this latest flare-up of Ebola. With virus persisting from the 2018-2020 Nord Kivu/Ituri EVD outbreak, it adds to the difficulty of ending an outbreak. When can one really feel certain an Ebola outbreak is over? - Mod.LK
