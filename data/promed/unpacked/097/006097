INFECTED AREA, DEFINITION

I don't have my copy of the International Health Regulations at hand, but I
think the concept of infected area is rather passe. With modern
transportation, migration, etc., it is epidemiologically difficult to
designate an area as infected.
In defense of WHO on waiting for a country to report its own cases, how often
have you seen country X blame its problem on country Y? Of course, the UK
would not stoop to such nefarious acts, but many of its [ex]colonies in the
past have done so.
Several years ago, Turkey informed WHO that there were cases of cholera in
the country (as there had been for years). Bulgaria and Romania immediately
closed those borders and the Turkish lemon crop rotted in trucks at the
border.

[I was assuming there are no endemic cases of cholera in the UK. As I
mentioned, the Thai-Burmese border area is neither an export crop production
area (if you exclude opium) nor a tourist area. So it would make good sense
for Thailand to declare the border a cholera-infected area {Myanmar (Burma)
declared Yangon (Rangoon) division infected at least as far back as 1994},
and ask WHO to state, along with the notification, that this is of no
significance for food exports or tourism. There is precedent: in WER No.37
of 13 September 1996, p.280, the notification of a case of plague in Arizona,
USA, is footnoted by WHO "This case of plague is of no significance for
international travel." -- Mod. JW]
