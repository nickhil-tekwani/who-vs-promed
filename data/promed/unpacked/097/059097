A white spot shrimp disease outbreak in Brazil has led to a price hike of 50 per cent since the beginning of the year as local production has fallen nearly 30 per cent, officials say. According to the Brazilian newspaper Folha de Sao Paolo, the disease outbreak has hit the production centers of Rio Grande do Norte and Ceara. While last year's [2015] countrywide production topped 76 000 metric tons, in 2016, the total is unlikely to surpass 60 000 tons.

According to the Brazilian Association of Shrimp Farmers, known by its Portuguese acronym ABCC, prices have risen from BNR 14.50 per kilogram (USD 4.56) to BNR 21.00/kg since the beginning of the year [2016].

The lack of local production has caused issues for restaurants. "The lack of shrimp is a serious problem in Brazil. It was aggravated by disease but it is a historical issue," Paul Solmucci, president of the Brazilian Association of Bars and Restaurants said.

[White spot viral disease (WSVD) has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. The virus was 1st detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries. The 1st diagnosed case of WSVD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, while the most recent outbreak in an area with free status according to OIE criteria, occurred in Brazil in 2005.

Acutely affected shrimps are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "white spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace. The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
