A new strain of wheat rust has led to a change in disease resistance ratings for some common wheat varieties.

Plant pathologist Grant Hollaway said a new strain of rust was detected in 2013 [ProMED-mail post 20131003.1981154], and last year [2014] it became widespread in New South Wales and Victoria. "This enabled us to get some good data on its effect on varieties," he said.

Dr Hollaway said that despite being widespread, the new strain of rust caused very little damage last season [2014] because of the dry finish, but growers needed to be vigilant about the impact of the disease as seasonal conditions were more conducive to rust this year [2015].

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_ (synonym _P. triticina_). Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 per cent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems and later on heads. Infection of the host can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" suddenly during favourable weather.

Spores are produced as the crop ripens and are spread by wind and mechanical means. The fungus needs living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, and control of volunteer crop plants. Crop monitoring is important for early discovery of infection so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of leaf rust with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring programmes have been established in different countries for early detection of new rust strains. They are often linked to regional resistance breeding programmes to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.

In Australia, a leaf rust strain able to overcome both the Lr13 and Lr24 wheat resistance genes was reported for the 1st time in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131003.1981154) and appears to have spread considerably since then.
