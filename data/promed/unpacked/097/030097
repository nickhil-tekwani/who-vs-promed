Chillies in parts of Tiruchirapalli district [of Tamil Nadu] have withered away due to powdery mildew disease. The Department [of Agriculture] has been closely monitoring the impact on various crops, including chillies.

In a couple of days, the growth is fast affected, resulting in the withering of the plant itself. Farmers said that they have to incur additional expenditure to save the crop.

[Powdery mildew of chilli and other capsicum variants is caused by _Leveillula taurica_ (previously _Oidiopsis_ spp.).

Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a range of host plants. The group includes many species in a number of genera. Generally, each fungal species is confined to a number of host species it can affect. Leaves are covered with white mycelium, and heavy infection leads to reduced photosynthetic ability and thus decreased plant vigour. The pathogens can cause serious losses in many important crops including vegetables, cereals, grapevine, hops, oilseed rape and sugar beet.

Spores are spread mainly by splashing rain, wind or mechanical means. The fungi overwinter in infected leaves on the ground. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures and the absence of rain. Powdery mildews are usually controlled with fungicides.
