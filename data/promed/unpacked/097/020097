The Ugandan Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries
has said that quarantine restrictions have been imposed on Bududa
County following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Shirobi
village in eastern part of the country.
A press release from the ministry was quoted on Friday by the Uganda
Broadcasting Corporation as saying that movement of livestock,
livestock products and by-products from, to and within Bududa county
is prohibited with immediate effect until further notice.
"Consequently, all livestock markets in Bududa county have been
closed with immediate effect," said the press release signed by J.B.
Kasirye, commissioner of livestock health and entomology.
The release called on veterinary staff, local councils, chiefs,
enforcement personnel and the general public to enforce quarantine
restrictions so that the disease is brought under control.

[OIE has no recent reports of FMD in adjoining countries, so
presumably it is an ongoing problem in Uganda. About this time in
2005 FMD was reported in Sironko, also in eastern Uganda; see ProMED
reports below. - Mod.MHJ]
