One point I may clarify: tularemia was diagnosed in 4 animals sampled out
of the actual shipment. The shipment was released before the sampled
animals were found to be infected.
The rest must be inferred from the short press release. My educated guess
is that the area was considered to be tularemia-free; that hares had to be
imported [by hunters' organizations for replenishing the local population;
that the finding of dead hares in the area was considered to be the
consequence of the recent introduction of infected animals into the area.
I am confident that the vet service is tackling the problem, and I am eager
to learn how it is moving, and the information it is gathering.
I am at loss in identifying the 'epidemiological decision' to which the
moderator refers when wondering on which basis it was taken. If he refers
to the letter alerting the local family doctors about the risk of tularemia
in humans, I may inform that [human tularemia is a nationally notifiable
disease in Italy. I gather from
<http://www.sanita.interbusiness.it/malinf/BollEpid/1996/tula.htm> that in
1996 there were 0 cases in the province of Pavia (much larger that the
Voghera district), 10 cases in the whole of Italy. My opinion is that it
is well to alert physicians when the risk of a rare disease becomes more
than remote.
If I were a family doctor in the USA. I would welcome an alert from an
agency which has spotted the importation of potential sources of tularemia
in my area.
Note: I am almost sure that the newspaper referred to the common European
hare, _Lepus timidus_; I would not think of them as domestic animals.

[Thanks to Pasquale we now know some of the background to the initial
identification of (4) infected hares. One wonders why the animals were
released before the laboratory results were available.
As to "the rest" which our member has inferred, can we have a more
authoritative statement from someone with specific knowledge, which was the
intent of my original comment. Inference and reality are two very separate
things, especially in epidemiology.
It is important to know whether the "dead hares ... in the area" were from
[A the positive released shipment or whether [B they were from the
pre-existing local population in Voghara (= "domestic Italian hares" of my
original note) ... my mistake, I forget that British English and Global
English are two different languages) reflecting either [B.1 a pre-existing
but only now realised local condition or [B.2 that the infection had
spread from the recently imported Hungarian hares into a previously
infection-free local Voghara hare population. Three importantly different
situations. The suggestion from the original news report was Hypothesis
B.2, which may be true but I still question if only to get reliable
information. That the imported shipment of hares was infected is not in
doubt. Has anyone "fingerprinted" these various isolates?
It was obviously wise to warn the local physicians, and with which I have
and had no quibbles. - Mod.MHJ
