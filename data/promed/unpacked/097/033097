A new outbreak of anthrax is beginning to worry health authorities in La Guajira, following the report of 60 dead animals and 3 people with cutaneous lesions in a rural zone of Manaure.

The Secretary of Health of La Guajira confirmed that the affected humans are out of danger and have been discharged to [outpatient care] at the Hospitals of Maicao and Manaure after having presented with lesions on their hands and necks.

[Cutaneous] anthrax lesions present as skin rashes in humans that go on to ulceration; they are painless, with raised edges with a dark center. Infection occurs when the bacteria enter through a skin cut or abrasion after contact with infected animals [or infected material from animals].

The new incident took place in the Wayuu community of Chochoshirra, where, as of today [23 May 2012], 60 animals have died (31 ovine [sheep], 26 caprine [goats], 3 porcine [pigs]).

The 1st case was reported on [15 May 2012] when a sheep died suddenly, and the community consumed the animal, resulting in 3 affected individuals. After the report from the community, officials from the ICA [Colombian Agricultural Institute] and from the Ministry of Health conducted a field visit, collecting specimens from animals whose [signs, animals do not have symptoms. - Mod.MHJ] were compatible with anthrax. Laboratory results from the National ICA lab are expected during this week.

According to a report from Maria de los Santos Benjumea, the director of the ICA, epidemiologic surveillance has been established in 8 nearby communities [so far without a positive report], while in the area with the outbreak, vaccination of 870 animals is ongoing to prevent further spread.

[It could well get worse. In 2010, they had 120 human cases with 2 deaths in similar sheep and goat outbreaks; for 2011, there is an absence of human case reports. This could have been purposeful under the circumstances.

To find La Guajira, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/txu-oclc-192062534-columbia_rel_2008.jpg. It is the small province in the north, poking out into the Caribbean. It is one of the poorest provinces in Colombia, with commensurate social and health problems. In these circumstances, the pig deaths will have been from them feeding on the sheep and goat carcasses or the tossed viscera from butchered infected animals. - Mod.MHJ]
