Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Transmission Risk in Canadian Hospital
----------------------------------------------------------------
WINDSOR: On 11 Mar 2001 surgeons at the Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital operated
on a woman who later tested positive for possible infection with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). CJD is extremely rare and usually fatal,
hospital neurosurgeon Dr. Srinivas Chakravarthi said on Thursday. CJD
occurs worldwide, typically in those over the age of 50, with about one
case per million people each year.
A variant of the disease has been linked directly [circumstantially - Mod.
to eating meat from cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
also known as mad cow disease. Nearly 100 people in Europe have died of new
variant CJD (vCJD) since 1995. Chakravarthi said he learned of the test
result, which is about 85 percent accurate, on Mon 7 May 2001. As a
precaution, the hospital halted all surgery and began disinfecting its
operating rooms and surgical equipment on Tue 8 May 2001.
Patients who have had neurosurgery at the hospital since March were being
contacted, said chief executive Frank Bagatto. However, "the odds of anyone
getting CJD is almost close to zero," Chakravarthi said at a news
conference. One good sign is that the woman who tested positive seems to be
doing well, which could indicate the test is a false positive, the surgeon
said. Meanwhile, Ontario's Health Minister warned on Thu 10 May 2001 that
patients may have been exposed to the disease at Windsor Regional Hospital
because of shared medical instruments. Hotel-Dieu frequently shares medical
equipment with other hospitals but seldom shares neurological equipment,
Chakravarthi said. He did not say if there had been any such sharing since
11 Mar 2001.

[The same report was forwarded also by Dr.Stefan Brockmann from the
Baden-Wuerttemberg State Health Office, Stuttgart, Germany. Essential
details are lacking in this report, such as the nature of the operation,
the age of the patient, and the reason for testing for CJD. Since variant
CJD has not been reported previously in North America, the patient is
likely to be a case of sporadic (classical) CJD, if the test is confirmed
positive. The sharing of medical [surgical? equipment between hospitals is
clearly an unsatisfactory situation and an appalling lapse in disease
security. The vCJD outbreak in the UK has focused attention on the
development of single use surgical instruments to avoid transmission of
prion-associated encephalopathies. Indeed, the re-use of surgical
instruments in tonsillectomy is already prohibited. - Mod.CP
