Influenza found in turkey flock in Sampson County, North Carolina
-------------------------------------------------
A turkey breeder flock in Sampson County has been confirmed to have
H3N2 influenza, according to Cooperative Extension Poultry Agent
James Cochran. The most likely source of the virus is a swine herd in
the area, he said.
The flock was late in its laying cycle when one house experienced a
drop in egg production. The flock processed shortly thereafter.
On 14 Jan 2005, the National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed
that the virus isolated from the flock at Rollins laboratory was a
subtype H3N2 influenza virus. This diagnosis has significance for
those that export to the Russian Federation, said state veterinary
officials. The export agreements made with Russia include the
requirement to report all subtypes of influenza diagnosed in
commercial poultry.
The isolation of H3N2 influenza from North Carolina poultry will be
reported by USDA to Russia. This will change North Carolina's Avian
Influenza status as it relates to Russian exports from A to B for the
next 30 days. After 30 days has passed the status will change to C.
It will be an additional 5 months before the status returns to A.
While in status B, processing plants located in the index county and
adjacent counties will not be able to export to Russia. The counties
affected include Sampson, Harnett, Johnston, Wayne, Duplin, Pender,
Bladen and Cumberland.
All other processing plants in the state exporting to Russia will
need to test 15 birds per flock for the virus at slaughter during the
30-day period if they wish to export to Russia. If the plant has no
intention of exporting product produced during the 30-day period they
do not need to test.
While in status C, processing plants located in the noted counties
can resume exports to Russia if they test 15 birds per flock at
slaughter. Processing plants located outside of the index county and
adjacent counties can discontinue testing for avian influenza.

[H3N2 is considered a low-pathogenicity variety. It also appears that
this outbreak will be managed without entire flock depopulation,
except for the flock of origin. - Mod.TG]
