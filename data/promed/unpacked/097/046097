Florida: West Nile Virus Lingers in Palm Beach County
-------------------------------------------------
Cool weather has cut into mosquito populations across Palm Beach County, but
those [mosquitoes] that remain still carry West Nile virus, county health
officials said on Fri 22 Nov 2002. New tests showed that 2 chickens in
"sentinel" flocks kept by the county came back positive for the virus,
meaning they were bitten by infected mosquitoes, the county health
department said. Last week 2 men living west of West Palm Beach came down
with the virus, in the county's first human cases of the year.
For the first time, one of the infected chickens was in a flock in Boca
Raton, confirming what officials have said all along, that the virus is
present everywhere and not just in the rural areas toward Lake Okeechobee.
The second affected chicken was in Belle Glade. "These findings prove there
are still mosquitoes in our area that are carrying this virus," said Dr.
Jean Malecki, director of the department. "It is very important that
individuals take precautions to avoid mosquito bites." Health officials urge
people to stay indoors during peak mosquito activity, at dusk and dawn.
