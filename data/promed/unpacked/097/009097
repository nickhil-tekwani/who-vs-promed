CJD SURVEILLANCE - CANADA

A nation-wide surveillance program for CJD will be launched this month from
Ottawa. Dr. Maura Ricketts, epidemiologist at the Laboratory Centre for
Disease Control, was cited as saying that by the end of the month, letters
will be sent to all doctors in Canada who treat brain disorders asking for
their co-operation in referring cases they suspect could be Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
The story says that Ricketts would like to see the "index of suspicion" for
the disease, which occurs naturally in about one in a million cases and is
invariably fatal, to be much higher.
The story adds that in Britain, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, with its
own distinctive pattern of brain lesions, has been linked to a strain
causing mad cow disease, which has resulted in the slaughter of some 2
million animals. According to the World Health Organization, 24 Europeans
(23 British and one French) have died so far of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob.
Ricketts was cited as saying that so far, the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
related to mad cow disease has not been found in North America - and she
devoutly hopes it never will be. But if cases emerge, she wants the unit to
be in a position to sound an alarm quickly.
Ricketts' co-investigator, neurologist and neurobiologist Neil Cashman of
the Montreal Neurological Institute, was cited as saying that in Canada,
about 25 to 30 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob a year come to light.
The story says that much of the diagnostic work for the surveillance program
will be done from a special neuropathology laboratory in the University of
Toronto's Centre for Research in Neurodegenerative Diseases.
Neuropathologist Catherine Bergeron and molecular biologist David Westaway,
a specialist in prion diseases who worked with Prusiner for 10 years, are
now analyzing brain samples to either confirm or rule out Creutzfeldt-Jakob
diagnoses.
The danger of handling infected tissue samples is considered so great that
not even cleaners are permitted through the doors, and all lab workers must
wear protective gear. Bergeron was cited as saying the lab is now nearly
"fully functional" and slide tissue samples have been coming in from all
over the country.
