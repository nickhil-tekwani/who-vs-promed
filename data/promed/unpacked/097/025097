Abstract
--------
Diarrhea remains one of the most common causes of death in children. Although many studies have investigated the prevalence of enteric pathogens around the globe some diarrheal episodes remain unexplained. It is possible that some yet-unidentified viral agents could be related to these cases of gastroenteritis.

By using viral metagenomics techniques, we screened 251 fecal samples of children between 0.5 to 2.5-year-old with acute diarrhea not associated with common pathogens. These children live in rural areas and have different levels of contact with animals such as pigs, cows, and bats. Here we report a complete genome of one mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) type 3, denoted TO-151/BR, detected in a female child in the state of Tocantins (north of Brazil). Brazilian TO-151/BR strain was classified as MRV-3 based on S1 phylogeny and was closely related to porcine Asian strains. Phylogenetic analyses showed that other segments were more similar to MRV-3s of different geographic locations and hosts, including humans and bats, highlighting genome reassortment and lack of host-specific barriers.

This is the 1st report of MRV-3 in South America and a hypothesis of a silent long-term circulation of this virus in Brazil has been raised.

[ProMED thanks Greg Folkers for this important submission on the 1st MRV case from Brazil, South America.

Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) is a non-enveloped, double stranded RNA virus. It is a part of the family Reoviridae. Mammalian orthoreovirus infects numerous mammalian species and vertebrates which serve as natural hosts.

From the article referenced above:
"MRVs are associated with gastrointestinal and respiratory illness and have been isolated from a wide variety of mammalian species including bats, minks, pigs, and humans.

In humans, MRV infections usually cause mild respiratory and enteric infections, displaying high fever, diarrhea, and vomiting symptoms. However, recently, reports associating MRV to more severe illnesses, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and respiratory distress syndrome, have been increasing [Chua KB et al. Identification and characterization of a new orthoreovirus from patients with acute respiratory infections. PLoS One 2008; 3, e3803; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0003803].

The authors conclude, "Contradicting reports fail to establish the pathogen role of MRV-3 unequivocally. MRV-3 infection may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Further, complexity is compounded by MRV-3 infection in association with other pathogens in human and animals. Pertaining to our study, gastroenteritis symptoms was observed in patient TO-151/BR, and may be associated with one (or more) of the enteric viruses (that is, Rotavirus A, Adenovirus and Norovirus), which was detected in the fecal sample. Alternatively, the presence of MRV-3 in feces may be due to dietary consumption of infected porcine meat."
