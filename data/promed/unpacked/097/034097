On 3 Dec 2017, a 56-year-old female from Panauti municipality, (Kavrepalanchok district) visited our hospital (out-patient department, Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital) presenting with a 3-day history of fever (over 101 F [38 C]), body ache, itching, pain and swelling in her right thumb near the wound, and pain and swollen right axilla lymph node. She developed these signs and symptoms 16 days after the rat bite on her right thumb. She was started on amoxicillin/clavulanic acid as an oral antimicrobial.

Every month, many people with rat/mouse bites visit our outpatient department of Sukraraj Tropical & Infectious Disease Hospital to find appropriate information about associated possible health consequences.

Rat bite fever (RBF) is mainly caused by 2 different bacteria known as Streptobacillary (_Streptobacillus moniliformis_) and Spirillary (_Spirillum minus_). Spirillary RBF is commonly known to occur in Asia, and, based on clinical presentations, our patient is more likely to have become infected with this bacterium. However, we do not perform laboratory testing to identify bacteria in patients with RBF in Nepal.

This is the 1st ever reported case of RBF in Nepal. RBF is a vastly overlooked zoonotic disease by healthcare workers in Nepal.

[This organism is part of the normal oral flora of the rat, just as other potential human pathogens such as _Pasteurella multocida_ and _Capnocytophaga canimorsus_ are part of the normal oral flora of cats and dogs, respectively. Zoonoses from pets are a fact of life, whether from a rat, an iguana, a turtle, or a dog or cat.

The following is extracted from MMWR 2005; 53(51 & 52): 1198-202 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5351a2.htm) regarding fatalities with rat bite fever (RBF) in adults:

"Although rapidly fatal pediatric cases of RBF have been described previously (2,3), similar mortality among adults has not been reported. Mortality attributed to severe systemic complications (such as, endocarditis, myocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, or multiple organ failure) has been documented in certain adult patients (1,4). Both patients described in this report [MMWR report above] died within 12 hours of presentation, allowing little opportunity for assessment and treatment. These case reports demonstrate that infection with _S. moniliformis_ can cause fulminant sepsis and death in previously healthy adults. As a result, prevention of severe disease might depend on increasing the awareness of appropriate risk-reduction activities and possible symptoms of RBF among persons who have exposure to rats. Intravenous penicillin is the treatment of choice, and prompt therapy can prevent severe complications (1). Because rapid laboratory confirmation of infection with _S. moniliformis_ might not be possible, clinicians should consider initiating empiric therapy for patients with a compatible clinical presentation and exposure history.

Clinicians should consider RBF in the differential diagnosis for unexplained febrile illness or sepsis in patients reporting rat exposure. Initial symptoms might be nonspecific, but a maculopapular rash and septic arthritis commonly develop (1,5). However, as demonstrated by the cases in this report, patients can have severe disease before the onset of typical symptoms. Despite its name, approximately 30 percent of patients with RBF do not report having been bitten or scratched by a rat (1,5). Risk factors for RBF include handling rats at home and in the workplace (such as, laboratories or pet stores). RBF is rare in the USA, with only a few cases documented each year (1,6,7). However, because RBF is not a nationally notifiable disease, its actual incidence has not been well described.

In the cases described here [MMWR report above], diagnosis of RBF was delayed in part because of the inability to rapidly isolate or identify _Streptobacillus moniliformis_. If infection with _S. moniliformis_ is suspected, specific media and incubation conditions should be used (8) (See Box at source URL above). In the absence of a positive culture, identification of pleomorphic Gram negative bacilli in appropriate specimens might support a preliminary diagnosis (1). In the event of an unexplained death in a person with rat exposure, performing an autopsy might also be critical to identifying an etiology.

Because of the high prevalence of colonization and asymptomatic infection with _S. moniliformis_ among rodents, testing and treatment of rats is not practical. Disease prevention should center on risk reduction among persons with frequent rat exposure. Adherence to simple precautions while handling rats can reduce the risk for RBF and other potential rodent-borne zoonotic infections, wound infections, and injuries. Persons should wear gloves, practice regular hand washing, and avoid hand-to-mouth contact when handling rats or cleaning rat cages (1,9). If bitten by a rat, persons should promptly clean and disinfect the wound, seek medical attention, and report their exposure history. A tetanus toxoid booster should be administered if more than 10 years have lapsed since the last dose (9,10).
