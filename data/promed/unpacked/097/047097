SALMONELLA LIVINGSTONE - W. EUROPE

An international outbreak of _Salmonella livingstone_
_Salmonella livingstone_ is a relatively rare serotype in Western Europe.

Reference laboratories in 11 countries reported 161 isolates in 1995 and
150 in 1996. The number of isolates identified during the first eight
months of 1997 were comparable with previous years, ranging from eight
(January) to 19 (August). In early December, however, the algorithm that is
applied to the European database to detect clusters highlighted an unusual
increase in this serotype, in six European countries. During September and
October over 50 cases occurred each month with a total of 208 cases
reported between January and October.
An alert that was sent to all participants as a result of recognising the
cluster prompted further investigations. Twenty-nine of the 128 cases in
August, September, and October were associated with travel, 26 of them with
Tunisia. None of the 80 cases reported to the end of July was associated
with travel abroad.
Further investigations will be conducted to describe the risk factors
associated with recent _S. livingstone_ infection.
