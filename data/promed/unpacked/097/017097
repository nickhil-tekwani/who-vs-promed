Over 20 children suffering from thalassemia [a genetic recessive
autosomal disorder that is manifested by decreased and defective
production of hemoglobin - Mod.CP] have tested positive for HIV
[human immunodeficiency virus] and hepatitis C virus infections,
allegedly after transfusion of infected blood at a hospital here, 2
years after a similar incident had prompted an inquiry by the
Rajasthan government.

While 3 children were found infected with HIV in May [2010] after
they were tested at S N Medical College [The Dr Sampurnanand Medical
College, Jodhpur], another 17 tested positive for hepatitis C virus,
the Marwar Thalassaemia Society claimed. Hospital officials said that
a 3-member committee had been formed by the hospital to enquire into
the matter.

At least 5 children were infected with HIV and 29 with hepatitis [C
virus] at the same hospital in December 2008 following transfusion of
infected blood, after which the state government had constituted a
committee headed by RND Purohit, the Director of the State AIDS
Control Society, who had suggested the need for adopting more
advanced techniques of [screening] blood donations.

The secretary of Thalassaemia Society, Vipin Gupta, claimed that no
action [had been] taken on the report. "Had the step been taken on
the recommendation of that committee, we would not have had these new
HIV infections," he said. However, RK Aseri, Principal of the SN
Medical College, said that a proposal for introducing the advanced
nucleic acid test (NAT) technique has already been sent to the state
government. According to Gupta, the present technique being used in
testing the blood during donation is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA), which has a window period -- the period of time
between HIV infection and the production of antibodies -- of 2-8
weeks. During the window [i.e. blind] period, an antibody test may
give a false negative result. "When we have the technology called NAT
[available], which has a window [i.e. blind] period of 3-7 days, how
can we allow the children to become infected with HIV and hepatitis,"
he [asked]. Gupta demanded early introduction of the NAT technique
and the setting-up of a fully equipped and staffed Thalassemia ward.

[Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized by abnormal
synthesis of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin consists of 2 main protein chains
called alpha and beta. Alpha-thalassemia involves defects in one or
more of the 4 genes required to make each protein chain. The main
symptom is anemia, the severity of which can vary amongst patients
depending on how many defective genes are involved. In
alpha-thalassemia, there is reduced or no alpha-globin production,
whereas in beta-thalassemia there is reduced or no beta-globin production.

Alpha-thalassemia predominates in Southeast Asia and Africa, and in
African Americans, whereas beta-thalassemia predominates in
Mediterranean countries, India, Pakistan, the Middle East, and China.
Life expectancy for patients with beta-thalassemia has improved over
the years because of regular transfusions and chelation therapy.
Consequently, maintenance of proper procedures in monitoring blood
donations is an essential component in the treatment of thalassemia.
