Researchers who discovered the toxic one-celled marine creature
_Pfiesteria_ said Friday they had confirmed it can cause memory loss in
animals. _Pfiesteria_ outbreaks killed thousands of fish earlier this year
-- millions over several outbreaks -- and frightened some consumers and
fishermen along the East coast. JoAnn Burkholder, who discovered and
named _Pfiesteria_, and colleagues at North Carolina State University said
tests showed that it could affect memory in rats. "The rats exposed to
_Pfiesteria_ toxin were significantly retarded in their learning," said
lead investigator Edward Levin. "No effect was seen in the recall of a
previously-learned task, but when the rats were called upon to learn a new
task, _Pfiesteria_-treated animals showed a significant learning deficit,"
the researchers wrote in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives.
People who have been exposed to _Pfiesteria_ in water have complained of
burning, rashes and memory loss. Burkholder said she herself experienced
such problems. Scientists however say there is no evidence that
_Pfiesteria_ can make seafood harmful to either people or animals. But they
say the appearance of new forms of previously harmless organisms like
_Pfiesteria_ point to growing environmental problems.
[This is a significant result as documentation of memory impairment and
other behavior symptoms in rats raises unfavorable possibilities. The
rats did not appear to have changes in blood profiles, and pathologies of
brain, liver etc. were absent. However, important information will be
obtained from observation of field exposures. The follow up work on the
people who showed symptoms in this summer's outbreak in Maryland is
critical. How are their memories now and how have they been since a
documented exposure? - Mod.PC
