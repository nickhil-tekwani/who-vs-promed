According to official sources some 18 cases were suspected to be Japanese encephalitis [JE] in Dimapur district [of Nagaland] and after laboratory tests, 9 cases were JE positive and the patients are undergoing treatment in various hospitals in Dimapur town.

Although there was a report of one death due to JE infection in a private nursing home in Dimapur, it could not be officially confirmed.

Of the patients who tested positive, 3 were said to be from towns in Assam bordering Dimapur, 5 were from Dimapur, and one from a village in Mokokchung district. The positive cases from Dimapur were mostly from the municipal area.

The Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus has claimed the life of a woman in Dimapur, according to a late report from the Health department on [Fri 19 Jul 2019].

The information was given by the programme officer of the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) Dr I Talitemsula Jamir.

While talking to Eastern Mirror she said, "Till date, out of 30 suspected cases, 9 were detected positive." One of them died in a hospital in Guwahati after being initially admitted to Eden Medical Centre in Dimapur.

According to her, the condition of some of the patients was not very good.

Quite interestingly, the chief medical officer of Dimapur had told this newspaper on [18 Jul 2019] that there were no reports of JE fatalities in district.

According to Jamir, initial tests were conducted at the Sentinel Surveillance Site Lab, District Hospital Dimapur in July [2019]. The confirmatory result was received in the evening on [17 Jul 2019], she said. "As soon as the result was out, investigation started in all the hospitals where the patients were admitted," she said

An entomological team has been on the move since [18 Jul 2019] to detect prevalence of the JE virus. Fogging operations have already started in Dimapur at Supply colony, Forest colony, Nepali Basti, 7th Mile, Industrial Estate, and Chumoukedima area.

It was informed that there is no cure for the virus so preventive measures remain the only option. The JE virus attacks the central nervous system, which makes it more severe than dengue. She urged the public to prevent mosquitoes from breeding.

Signs and symptoms:
- headache, fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, paralysis, and loss of coordination;
- it is associated with neurological complications leading to death.

Transmission of JE:
- JE [virus] is transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes;
- JE virus remains in the water birds like pond herons and cattle egrets in nature;
- pigs play an important role in JE, as JE virus multiplies in pigs without them suffering from the disease and [carry] the virus for a long time;
- mosquitoes while biting pigs pick up the infection easily and pass it on to humans when they bite again;
- JE is not transmitted from human to human like malaria and other vector borne diseases.

Is there a vaccine for JE?
- Yes, vaccine is available for JE;
- government provides this vaccine for children in JE affected areas.

How do we prevent JE?
- The best way to prevent JE is through control of mosquito vectors;
- stagnant water bodies should be drained or filled up, and surroundings kept clean and dry;
- rice fields can cover wide areas and chemical control may not be feasible. In such situations, water management measures like alternate wetting and drying may be applied to reduce vector population;
- during pre-monsoon when water bodies are confined to small ponds and tanks, vector control measures can be planned;
- personal protection through use of repellents and mosquito nets are effective control measures;
- introduce larvivorous fish in the paddy fields and other stagnant water bodies to eat up the mosquito larvae;
- larvivorous fish are available at Urban Malaria Scheme at Chief Medical Officer office, Dimapur;
- it is discouraged to rear pigs near human dwellings as the virus gets multiplied and amplified in the pigs, and can then be transmitted to humans;
- spread of awareness is important for prevention and also to detect and treat patients early to increase chance of survival and reduce long term deficits after recovery.

In case of any illness [with symptoms which resemble those] of JE, visit your nearest health centre/district hospital for investigation and treatment of cases.

[It is not surprising that JE cases are occurring in Nagaland. It is adjacent to Assam state, where a JE outbreak with additional cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) are occurring. In these Nagaland reports, however, no AES cases are mentioned. Since this is still the JE virus transmission season it is likely that there will be more cases over the next 2 months. Although the 2nd report above does mention that the JE vaccine is available, it does not say if there have been recent JE vaccination campaigns in the affected areas, or if any are planned. - Mod.TY
