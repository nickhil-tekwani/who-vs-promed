[1] Diarrhea - Iraq (Al-Najaf governorate)

The Executive Committee for the Prevention of Cholera in Al-Najaf governorate in Iraq confirmed on [Thu 13 Apr 2017] that no cases of cholera have been recorded in the governorate despite the increased cases of acute diarrhea, which is due to lack of chlorine in the drinking water.

A statement by the Director General of Al-Najaf Health Department, Ali Abdul Zahra, mentioned that an important meeting was held in the department on [Thu 13 Apr 2017] to discuss the causes of recording a number of cases of acute diarrhea in some areas of the governorate. He stressed that the reason is due to the lack of chlorine in the drinking water.

The Director of the Gastroenterology Unit in the Department of Public Health, Abdul Amir Al-Musawi, said in the same statement that laboratory tests confirm that no cases of cholera have been recorded. He indicated that some cases of acute diarrhea have occurred in some areas of the governorate due to the low level of chlorine in the water in these areas. He added that "in summer season, we need to increase the health awareness of the people, with the commitment to add adequate rates of chlorine according to what is determined by the health authorities."

A number of residents of districts and sub-districts in the outskirts of Al-Najaf complained of the poor quality and bad smell of the drinking water in addition to the increased salinity, with the occurrence of many cases of acute diarrhea.

[3] Gastroenteritis - Nepal (Kathmandu)
Date: Sat 8 Apr 2017
From: Dr. Sher Pun <drsherbdr@yahoo.com> [edited]


Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) has seen a sharp increase in the number of acute gastroenteritis cases (approximately 4 cases per day) over the past 2 weeks (since 20 Mar 2017). Some were in a state of shock due to severe diarrhea and vomiting during hospitalization. Nevertheless, so far, no definitive causative organism (including cholera) or toxin or chemical has been identified.

According to duty medical officers, most patients had watery diarrhea (some had rice water stool). In Nepal, testing for a causative agent of diarrhea is rarely done by physicians. STIDH routinely performs stool culture but usually restricted to cholera, shigella, and salmonella testing (not of viral origin). Early identification of other possible causative organisms or toxins or chemicals can help prevent/reduce further spread of acute gastroenteritis in the future in Nepal.

[The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J. Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015; oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
