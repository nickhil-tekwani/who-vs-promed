[As mentioned in the announcement, this is now the 6th laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection reported by Oman, with the most recent prior confirmed case occurring in January 2015 (see MERS-CoV (08): Oman, Saudi Arabia, WHO 20150117.3097488, MERS-CoV (06): Oman, new case, RFI 20150111.3085228, MERS-CoV (04): Oman, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20150108.3079584). It should be noted that the 2 most recent reported asymptomatic MERS-CoV infections in humans from the UAE involved individuals transporting MERS-CoV infected camels from Oman to the UAE (see MERS-CoV (47): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, WHO 20150526.3383778). More information on possible high-risk exposures of this individual would be greatly appreciated.

[4] South Korea, 15 total cases - media report
Date: 31 May 2015

http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20150531000439


Seoul authorities on Sunday [31 May 2015] scrambled to block the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome by establishing a new task force consisting of government authorities as well as civil medical experts and facilities.

As of Sunday [31 May 2015] afternoon, 15 cases had been confirmed in Korea, surpassing Qatar as the country with the 4th most MERS cases in the world. The hospital where more than 10 people are believed to have been infected by the 1st confirmed patient prior to his official diagnosis was temporarily shut down.

Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo offered an apology Sunday [31 May 2015] for the government's poor handling of the potential MERS patients and announced that the new task force would put forth its best efforts to combat the spread of the disease. With the establishment of the team, potential MERS patients who are considered the most vulnerable -- those who are aged 50 or older and those with chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease -- will be quarantined with extra medical attention and care.

"We are considering this coming week as a crucial turning point in which the situation can either get worse or better," the minister said during a press meeting in Seoul.

"We believe all of the 14 cases, except the very 1st case, are secondary infection cases. The government is doing its best to prevent tertiary infection. And in order to do this, we need cooperation from all health care workers and citizens."

The 1st confirmed patient, quarantined as of [20 May 2015], had visited 4 medical clinics and hospitals over the course of 10 days prior to his diagnosis, from [11-20 May 2015].

The incubation period of MERS is 2 to 14 days, and all of the confirmed patients contacted the 1st patient, who is believed to be the sole spreader of MERS in Korea, from [15-17 May 2015]. As the 1st patient stayed at another clinic -- the last of the 4 -- prior to his diagnosis from [17-20 May 2015], more people may be diagnosed this week, as the incubation period of those who may have been infected at the medical facility lasts until Thursday [4 Jun 2015].

Among the 14 patients who are believed to be infected by him, 12 worked or stayed at the same facility as the 68-year-old who was being treated there as an inpatient from [15-17 May 2015]. The facility is the 2nd of the 4 clinics he visited or stayed at before being quarantined.

The remaining 2 patients are health care workers who treated the 1st patient prior to his diagnosis, at 2 different medical clinics, on [15 and 17 May 2015], respectively. The average age of all 15 patients is 53.1 years old.

As the number of confirmed patients rose from 1 to 15 within only 11 days, there has been a growing public demand for the government to identify the now-temporarily closed hospital where 12 people were infected. Rumors claiming certain hospitals to be avoided have been going viral since last week, especially via social media and KakaoTalk.

The government said hospitals that are related to any infectious diseases cannot be identified according to its protocol, as such facilities and those who stay there can easily be targets of social stigmatization. The Health Ministry and the police also announced that those who spread such rumors online can face punishment.

The Health Ministry has been under fire for its handling of the spread of MERS, especially after the diagnosis of the 4th patient whose earlier request to be quarantined had been rejected by the authorities.

The government also failed to prevent the 10th patient, who is the son of the 3rd patient and the younger brother of the 4th, from going overseas on [26 May 2015]. Although he was not diagnosed with MERS prior to leaving the country for China, he had already been showing symptoms including a fever.

He was eventually diagnosed with MERS in China on Friday [29 May 2015]. Seoul's failure to prevent him from leaving the country left 165 passengers and crew members on board with him at potential risk of infection. Once arriving in Hong Kong by plane, the man traveled to [mainland] China by taking 2 buses. According to Chinese news outlets, it is not known how many passengers were on the buses.

To prevent tertiary infection cases, Health Minister Moon asked the public to report to the authorities if they are experiencing MERS symptoms -- a high fever and coughing -- after visiting the Middle East, as well as to wash their hands properly and to wear masks in public places. He also urged all health care workers to be alert to the situation and file a report immediately if they come across a patient who may have MERS.

On top of the 2 newly confirmed cases, an enlisted soldier, as well as 30 of his colleagues, were isolated on Sunday [31 May 2015] as he reported that he spent time with his mother, who was later diagnosed with MERS, during his recent break on [12 May 2015]. Although quarantined, the soldier and his colleagues were not showing any symptoms.

MERS is known to be caused by coronaviruses, a large family of viruses that cause a range of illnesses in humans from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome.

There is no known cure or vaccine for MERS, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 percent.

More than 95 percent of the confirmed cases worldwide were in the Middle East, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. The 2 countries have the highest number of MERS patients: 996 and 74, respectively, followed by Jordan and Korea [the total number of confirmed cases reported by Saudi Arabia is now 1014; see section [2] above. - Mod.MPP].

[From another media report, the 2 most recently confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in South Korea involved a 35-year-old male who was hospitalized in the same ward as the index case, and another 35-year-old female who visited her mother who was admitted to the same ward as the index case (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-05/31/c_134284713.htm).

Reflecting on the above media report and other reports that are blaming health authorities for the spread of the disease in South Korea, it appears that the occurrence of the outbreak is also related to the absence of knowledge on the part of healthcare professionals to seek travel histories on patients presenting to health facilities, and to keep current with information on diseases that are occurring outside of their country, city and state/province. This seems to be a repetitive phenomenon observed. Within the recent past, reports on ProMED have been consistent with this observation: The index case of MERS in South Korea; the 1st imported case of Ebola in the USA; the most recent imported case of Lassa fever in the USA. Healthcare personnel at the front lines do not seem to be uniformly aware of the need for travel histories, nor are they necessarily aware of outbreaks occurring outside of their catchment areas.

On checking the Korean MOH announcement of the index case, the following additional information was available: the individual developed symptoms of (fever and cough) on 11 May 2015 (7 days after arrival back in South Korea). He sought medical care at Hospital A on 11 May 2015 on an outpatient basis. Was admitted to Hospital B on 12 May 2015 and discharged on 14 May 2015. He visited the emergency department of Hospital C on 17 May 2015, was admitted to Hospital C on 18 May 2015, and discharged on 20 May 2015. A sputum sample was sent for test on 19 May 2015, and the sample tested positive for MERS-CoV on 20 May 2015 (done by the Korea National Institute of Health). The patient was transferred to the nationally designated treatment facility for isolation. In addition, he was in the Middle East for agricultural products business and while there was not in contact with animals like camels or patients with similar respiratory symptoms during his stay in Bahrain or while returning to Korea (http://english.mw.go.kr/front_eng/al/sal0201vw.jsp?PAR_MENU_ID=1002&MENU_ID=100203&page=1&CONT_SEQ=322606). - Mod.MPP]

[5] Hong Kong, quarantines 18 - media report
Date: 31 May 2015
Source: Xinhua Net [edited]
http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-05/31/content_20868919.htm


18 people having close contact with a South Korean man infected with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been sent to a quarantine camp, including 2 South Korean women who had earlier refused to be quarantined, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has said.

With the city on high alert over Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on Saturday [30 May 2015], the 2 Korean women among 18 plane passengers who sat close to the MERS patient have been tracked down in the Causeway Bay shopping district and quarantined, according to the HKSAR government news website on Saturday.

Secretary for Food and Health of HKSAR government Ko Wing-man said that with assistance from the diplomatic personnel of South Korea in Hong Kong, the 2 women finally accepted to be quarantined.

"This is very important, because once they are in the quarantine camp, our medical personnel from the Center for Health Protection will be able to chip in and conduct medical assessment," Ko said.

Hong Kong's health authorities have made plans for the 18 plane passengers to be quarantined for weeks at the Lady MacLehose Holiday Village in Sai Kung.

The 44-year-old South Korean MERS patient flew from Seoul to Hong Kong on Tuesday [26 May 2015] before heading to China's mainland by bus. He is thought to have contracted the deadly virus from his father and traveled against the advice of doctors. He is confirmed as China' s 1st imported MERS case and is currently being held in isolation at a hospital in Huizhou in China's southern province of Guangdong.

MERS was 1st identified in humans in 2012. The virus is similar to that which causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.

The number of South Koreans infected with MERS has risen to 15 after 2 new cases were detected, according to the South Korean health ministry on Sunday [31 May 2015].

The World Health Organization has reported more than 1000 cases of MERS globally and more than 400 deaths.

China has isolated 82 people who came in close contact with the country's 1st MERS patient amid concerns over the spread of the deadly virus in China.

A 44-year-old man who flew from Korea to Hong Kong was tested positive for the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Guangdong on Friday [29 May 2015].

He is receiving medical treatment in Huizhou City, but his condition has worsened, the provincial health and family planning commission said today [31 May 2015].

Meanwhile, the number of people who had been in close contact with the patient rose to 77 in Guangdong, the commission said.

Among them, 64 have been quarantined, while 13 others, including 11 passengers on a bus boarded by the man, have remained out of contact, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. None of the quarantined has showed any abnormality.

The commission said more medical specialists were sent to Huizhou today [31 May 2015] to help with the treatment.

Also, 18 people having close contact with a South Korean man infected with MERS have been sent to a quarantine camp, including 2 South Korean women who had earlier refused to be quarantined, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has said.

With the city on high alert over MERS on Saturday [30 May 2015], the 2 Korean women among 18 plane passengers who sat close to the MERS patient have been tracked down in the Causeway Bay shopping district and quarantined, the report said. He had close contact with MERS patients at home and expressed discomfort as early as [21 May 2015].

The patient is the son of the 3rd confirmed MERS case in the Republic of Korea [ROK] and the brother of the ROK's 4th confirmed case.

MERS is a respiratory illness caused by a new type of coronavirus. The 1st case was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease, which has a fatality rate of 40.7 per cent.

Epidemiologic update: MERS-CoV 30 May 2015
------------------------------------
Recent developments:

South Korea
On 20 May 2015, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in a 68-year-old man with recent travel history to the Middle East. According to WHO, the man had the following travel history:

[18-29 Apr 2015], Bahrain;
[29-30 Apr 2015], United Arab Emirates;
[30 Apr 2015 to 1 May 2015], Bahrain;
1-2 May [2015], the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia;
2 May [2015], Bahrain; and
2-3 May [2015], Qatar.

The case arrived at Korea's Incheon International airport via Qatar on 4 May [2015] while being asymptomatic. On 11 May [2015], he developed cough and fever and sought medical care at an outpatient clinic between 12 and 15 May [2015]. He was hospitalised on 15 May [2015], discharged on 17 May [2015] and readmitted the same evening in another hospital after presenting to the emergency department. On 20 May [2015], he tested positive for MERS-CoV and was transferred to the nationally designated treatment facility for isolation. The patient has no history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to detection. Investigation of the source of infection is ongoing. [1]

As of 30 May [2015], the index case has resulted in 11 secondary cases:

One patient sharing his room and 4 patients admitted in the same ward;
Three healthcare workers having cared for the index case;
Three among close family members: the wife of the index case, and the son and daughter of a patient admitted in the same ward.
Onset dates range from 11 May [2015] for the index case until 28 May [2015] for the 2 most recent nosocomial cases, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.

The son of the patient admitted in the same ward travelled to Hong Kong, Guangdong province, China on 26 May 2015. He was admitted and isolated in a hospital in Hong Kong on 27 May 2015. This patient was confirmed positive for MERS-CoV infection on 29 May [2015]. [2]

United Arab Emirates
The United Arab Emirates have reported in May 2015 2 asymptomatic cases found through enhanced surveillance. According to WHO, both cases had a history of contact with MERS-CoV infected camels imported from Oman. The United Arab Emirates have reported 76 cases of MERS-CoV since 13 July 2013. 29 of the 76 cases were healthcare workers.

Qatar
Since the last rapid risk assessment on [7 Mar 2015], Qatar has reported 3 additional cases. All cases were male. One of the cases had frequent contact with camels.

Saudi Arabia
Since the last rapid risk assessment on [7 Mar 2015], Saudi Arabia has reported 72 additional cases and 40 deaths. Of the 72 cases, 78 percent (n=56) were male. The average age for 72 cases was 53 years, ranging from 20 to 93 years. 21 of the 72 cases were classified as having contact with a confirmed case either in the community or hospital. Five of the 72 cases were healthcare workers. Eight of the 72 cases reported animal contact, and 7 reported having drunk camel's milk.

Worldwide situation
Since April 2012 and as of 30 May 2015, 1172 cases (including 479 deaths) from MERS-CoV have been reported by health authorities worldwide [Figure 1. Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV by month and probable place of infection, March 2012 - 30 May 2015 (n=1172) available at source URL.]

Geographical distribution
Most of the cases have occurred in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Jordan, Oman, Kuwait, Egypt, Yemen, Lebanon and Iran) (Table 2).

People's Republic of China: 1 / 0

Cumulative number: 1172 / 479

All cases reported from outside the Middle East have a recent travel history to the Middle East or contact with a case who has a travel history to the Middle East [Figure 2. Geographical distribution of confirmed MERS-CoV cases and place of probable infection as of 29 May 2015 (n=1172) available at source URL].

Conclusion
The importation of a case of MERS-CoV to a 3rd country is not unexpected and has happened in the past. On several occasions, notably in France and in the UK, it has resulted in secondary transmission among patients and healthcare workers in contact with the imported cases, as well as among close relatives of cases. However, clusters of this size have not been observed so far outside of the Arabian Peninsula. WHO indicates that there is currently no indication that the virus behaves differently than in other instances in the past and that there is no indication of sustained transmission from person to person. It is the 1st time that an imported case has resulted in a secondary transmission affecting another country.

ECDC's conclusion continues to be that the MERS-CoV outbreak poses a low risk to the EU. Because of the continued risk of case importation to Europe after exposure in the Middle East, international surveillance for MERS-CoV cases remains essential.

Although sustained human-to-human transmission is unlikely, secondary transmission in unprotected close contacts, including healthcare settings, remains possible, as currently seen in South Korea.

An overview of MERS-CoV infection is presented in an ECDC fact sheet [3], which also provides a detailed overview of measures to be taken by health professionals for case management and treatment.
