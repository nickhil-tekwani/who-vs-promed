There has been an increase nationwide in a painful childhood disease called hand-foot-mouth disease [HFMD].

Symptoms usually include a fever, painful blisters on the mouth, hands, and feet. KXAN checked in with a local doctor to find out if the cases are still on the rise. Dr Michael Ginnrich with the Austin Regional Clinic says the illness usually impacts kids under the age of 5 but says it can spread to older kids and adults in a less severe form.

"For adults usually they just have a sore throat -- that's the best clue," he says.

The pediatrician says the virus is highly contagious for up to a week and says the biggest sign for parents to watch for is when the child isn't eating and has a fever. "A lot of times if you're looking you'll see a little red spot around the hands, feet, or diaper area and sometimes even a little blister which is really a giveaway for this disease," Ginnrich says.

The doctor says kids should stay home from school and child care facilities as long as they have a fever, "I think most kids have a pretty tough time for about 3 days and maybe for a week they are not feeling perfect and after that they are doing OK," he says.

Since the illness is a virus, pediatricians suggest hand washing is the best defense. The Austin Regional Clinic says the cases of hand-foot-mouth disease appear to be on the decline just in time for flu season.

Hand-foot-mouth disease, notorious for closing down kindergartens and making small children cranky, is hitting college campuses.

College students across the East are hunkered down in dorm rooms, waiting for the unsightly blisters that characterize the infection to clear from the faces and hands, university spokespeople said.

Health officials say the unusual outbreaks are marked by a particularly nasty set of symptoms that include the usual blisters in the mouth and on the hands and feet, but also on the genitals.

Health officials in several states are testing samples to determine which virus is responsible. Several different viruses, including coxsackie viruses and enteroviruses, can cause the symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease.

"I have never seen this before," said Dr Roanna Kessler, medical director of the wellness center at Johns Hopkins University's Homewood campus, which has been hit hard by the outbreak. So far, 129 students at the north Baltimore campus have been diagnosed with the illness.

"In previous years we have usually seen it in only a handful of people." Outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease are common in the fall, winter, and spring, especially at elementary schools and daycare centers. Small children are especially susceptible because they have never been exposed before to the viruses that cause it.

Teens and young adults can also develop hand-foot-mouth disease but it usually doesn't cause widespread outbreaks like it does among young kids.

But so far this year [2018], Johns Hopkins, Princeton, Dartmouth, West Virginia University, Lehigh University, Wesleyan University in Connecticut and Mars Hill University in North Carolina have all reported outbreaks. Florida State University battled an outbreak in 2016.

It's not clear why so many older teens and young adults are being affected, Kessler said.

"We are wondering if it is a strain that people were not exposed to when they were younger," she said. Medical journals have carried reports of a mutated strain of coxsackievirus A6 causing severe outbreaks in Asia and Europe.

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults. Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. However, it can sometimes occur in older children and adults.

Kessler also wonders if the unusually warm fall weather experienced across the eastern United States has helped the virus stay around and spread more than it normally would.

But college campuses -- where students share bathrooms, desks, equipment, and where they frequently share food and drink, embrace, and kiss -- are perfect grounds for spreading infectious diseases of all kinds.

Usually, freshmen are prone to "mono," [infectious mononucleosis] Kessler said. Mononucleosis is usually caused by Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. This year [2018], it may be hand-foot-mouth disease, she said.

Most people with hand-foot-mouth disease recover after a few days. There's no specific treatment for it and the universities are telling students to stay in their dorms or at home if they have symptoms. That's not difficult to get them to do, Kessler said.

"It is very upsetting for them, especially if they develop lesions around the face," she said. "They usually self-isolate in that situation because they don't want to be seen out and about."

Severe rashes on the hands can also make nails fall out, she said. Students have complained that lesions in the mouth make it uncomfortable to eat and drink, and this strain is causing genital rashes as well, adding to the embarrassment.

"It's bad enough when little toddlers get it," Kessler said. Johns Hopkins has put up signs and distributed information about the virus.

"Facilities has been doing extra cleaning in affected areas," a spokesman added. "We are giving out disinfectant wipes at the health center to any student with symptoms of hand-foot-mouth disease, so they can wipe down areas that they may have touched."

[The occurrence of numerous cases of hand-foot-mouth disease in young adults across the United States as documented by the report above is a cause for concern, since the HFMD epidemiology is different from the conventional, much younger (infant/toddler) age group.

"Recently, severe worldwide outbreaks of HFMD have occurred, caused by a strain of coxsackievirus that is less common than EV (enterovirus) 71 or CV (coxsackievirus) A16. This newly recognized strain, CV A6, affects both children and adults. The CV A6 strain was first identified in Finland in 2008 during a major outbreak of HFMD. Later outbreaks were detected across Asia and Europe." (https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/features/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease-in-adults/article/681170/)

"Diagnosis of HFMD can often be made by analyzing stool samples or by taking swab samples of the oropharynx for the virus. Typically, the virus that causes HFMD features an incubation period of 4 to 6 days, which is quickly followed by symptoms such as a sore throat with vesicles, fever, malaise, and hand vesicles. During the 1st week, patients are most contagious; however, many patients remain infectious for 4 to 8 weeks following symptom onset due to residual stool shedding. Although complications (such as viral meningitis and encephalitis) associated with the disease are not common, temporary fingernail and toenail loss sometimes occurs."

Due to the high prevalence of HFMD in infants and children, most clinicians are well-versed in managing the disease in the pediatric population. However, with more adults being affected by HFMD, many clinicians may not be fully aware of how to identify and/or manage these patients due to the lack of information regarding adult approaches. Fortunately, many of the diagnosis and treatment strategies for pediatric HFMD generalize to adult patients. Symptom management may be the most optimal treatment strategy, particularly in the majority of mild HFMD cases, to help manage ulcer pain and fever."

First of all , it would be helpful to identify the responsible pathogen (most likely viral), and characterize any genetic changes that may have resulted in improving its capacity to infect or re-infect across age groups. Investigation into individual outbreaks for common or otherwise epidemiological features, including risk factors or behaviors, can also help provide better messages for prevention. - Mod.UBA
