A rabid wolf has bitten 6 persons on the premises of the Chernobyl
atomic power plant, 4 of them employees of SSE Chernobyl and 2
employees of the contractor organization UAB. They did not manage to
get away, all were injured and hospitalized. The patients are being
treated in the specialized health care facilities of Slavutich and
Ivankov cities. The conditions of all are satisfactory. The police
patrol shot the rabid wolf the same night. Rabies was confirmed in the
animal by the laboratory.

Alexandr Gardetskiy, the attorney of Kievskiy oblast, stated that
policing in the Chernobyl zone is not being conducted properly due to
staff shortages. He also said that taking radiation contaminated
animals, lumber and metal scrap off the Chernobyl zone is common and
only 2 policemen patrol the territory daily.

Recently, a rabid stray cat has attacked 5 people in one of the
townships in Crimea [Ukraine]. The cat occupied a path and attacked
everyone who tried to pass his territory; 5 people were attacked in
one day. The cat has been killed and the tests confirmed rabies. The
bitten people are on outpatient treatment now. 3 stray dogs and 3
domestic cats suspected of having contact with the sick cat have been
exterminated; 62 dogs and 50 cats have been immunized and vaccination
continues. Quarantine limitations have been imposed in a 10km
[6.2-mile] radius around this Crimean township.

[Laboratory diagnosis of rabies in animals is conducted on central
nervous system (CNS) tissue removed from the cranium. A composite of
CNS samples should be tested and the brain stem is the most important
component of the sample.

The deteriorating rabies situation in Ukraine is a cause for concern,
as also apparent from a previous posting (see 20090814.2890). We
repeat the following request for information, included in the said
posting:

"The reportedly increased rabies incidence in Ukraine is somewhat
puzzling in view of the statement that oral vaccination of wildlife is
being applied. It will help to obtain information on the oral
vaccination's date of inauguration, number of distributions per year,
mode of application, number of baits per square kilometer,
geographical coverage, the baiting material used and the vaccine
strain." - Mod.AS]
