Officials from the Department of Agriculture have been dispatched to a banana plantation in Chiang Rai province after a report of an alleged outbreak of Panama disease. They cannot yet confirm whether it is Panama disease, and the disease has never occurred in Thailand before.

The official said that that the Chinese company allegedly imported cuttings illegally to be planted," adding that the alleged disease is presently limited to this one plantation. Biochemists have taken samples from the infected banana plants for testing and the analysis will be completed within a week and officials are destroying the infected banana trees in a bid to contain the disease.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But in recent years, Tropical Race 4 (TR4) has also been reported outside that area in the Middle East, Africa and Asia (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). TR4 is of great concern worldwide.

In 2017, PD was reported for the 1st time from Thailand's neighbour Laos (ProMED-mail post 20171108.5432554) which borders Chiang Rai province. Other than illegal cuttings suspected as a source of the incursion above, spread from Laos via other means may also be a possibility.
