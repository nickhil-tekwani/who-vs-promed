In regards to the moderator's comment "how one stays away from rodents is
unclear", I can offer an excerpt from "Hantavirus in the Americas.
Guidelines for prevention, diagnosis, treatment and control":
=====================
These guidelines can be readily followed with minimal investment in
expensive or hard-to-use equipment or materials. They also can be applied
generally to help reduce encounters with rodents and their excreta, and
they do not require specialized skills in rodent species identification.
General precautions for residents of affected areas.
* Reduce the availability of food sources and nesting sites used by rodents
inside the home.
* Eliminate rodents inside the home
* Discourage children from playing with rodents or their nests, and advise
them to tell their parents if they see rodents or their nests.
* Keep food (including pet food) and water covered and stored in
rodent-proof metal or plastic containers with tight fitting lids.
* Wash dishes and cooking utensils immediately after use and reomove all
spilled food.
* Dispose of trash and clutter.
* Use spring-loaded rodent traps in the home continuously.
* As an adjunct to traps, use rodenticide with bait under a plywood or
plastic shelter (a covered bait station) on an ongoing basis inside the house.
======================
This publication also offers guidelines for preventing rodent infestation,
eliminating rodents inside the home and clean up of rodent-contaminated
areas. Other chapters focus on the epidemiology, surveillance, clinical
manifestations, treatment and control of the hantavirus. Please contact me
if interested in aquiring this guide.

[These are excellent recommendations and we are grateful to Ms Cooke for
providing them. I did not mean to indicate that one could not reduce one's
degree of contact with rodents. It is, however, impossible to eliminate
the possibility that one is inhaling, touching, stepping in and otherwise
contacting rodents where they live because where they live is where we
live. All we can do is to follow the guidelines above and hope to minimize
contact. The original message indicated that the state health department
was warning people to stay away from rodents, a good idea but not one that
can be attained with perfection. I am convinced that acquisition of
infection with a hantavirus is often a matter of bad luck. However, that
in no way suggests we should not all do our best to keep the little buggers
(the rodents and, therefore, the viruses) out of our lives as much as we
can. - Mod.CHC ....................................chc/es
