Sheep Pox Makes a Comeback
-----------------------------------
Sheep pox [SP] has returned to Mongolia. For the 1st time since the
1970s, there has been an outbreak of this highly contagious viral
disease in 5 different soums [districts] of 4 eastern and central
aimags [provinces].
Veterinary laboratory tests confirmed last week that sheep there had
died of this dreaded disease. No human case has been reported as of
yet. [SP is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS]
The State Professional Inspection Agency has urged citizens of
Ulaanbaatar to check the source of the meat they buy. Checkpoints on
the major motor roads to Ulaanbaatar are ensuring that no raw meat
enters Ulaanbaatar, and officials are destroying any suspicious meat,
skins, internal organs and wool they find [See commentary]. Checks on
all vehicles have resulted in delays in routes to Sukhbaatar aimag
and also in postal services.
The outbreak was 1st reported on 17 Dec 2006 by 2 herders in Asgat
soum, Sukhbaatar aimag. They had watched 29 sheep die before they
realized something was seriously amiss and called in local veterinary
experts. At that time, around 30 more of the animals in their barns
showed symptoms of the disease. Strict quarantine of livestock was
imposed all over the aimag and also in Galshar soum of Khentii aimag,
where 33 sheep were reported to be infected.
By 2 Jan 2007, 29 more sheep had died in Asgat soum, 2 each in
Galshar soum and in Bayan soum of Tov aimag, and 4 in Gobisumber
aimag. On that day, 365 sheep from all over Mongolia were reported as
showing symptoms of the disease.
A joint working group from the National Emergency Management Agency,
the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the State Veterinary Agency,
and the State Professional Inspection Agency is working at the
disease outbreak points. These now include the Sumber soum of
Gobisumber aimag, where 2 animals have died, and Bayan soum of Tov
aimag. Ikh Bulag Khar Tolgoi area, which is located 28 km northeast
from the center of Bayan soum, has reported 19 infected sheep.
Tuvshinjargal, a herder of Tov aimag, bought 60 sheep from Sukhbaatar
aimag in September 2006, and these are being suspected of carrying
the virus to the central aimags. [Sukhbaatar is situated in eastern
Mongolia, bordering China's Inner Mongolia; see administrative map at
<http://www.legendtour.ru/foto/m/map02.jpg>. - Mod.AS]
The government has shipped 40 000 doses of the sheep pox vaccine to
the affected aimags, except to Gobisumber and Tov. Altogether,
between 1.5 and 2 million sheep will require vaccination. Mongolia
produces the vaccine, but at the moment, there is a shortage of raw
materials, so the government may have to go for imports.
According to emergency regulations governing outbreak of any
livestock epidemic, if more than 4 aimags are affected, the
government must declare a state of high alert before the lambing
season in spring.

[The highest losses caused by infection of sheep with the SP virus
are ascribed to the extreme high mortality in offspring. In contrast,
mortality in adult animals might be moderate even though infectivity
is high, clinical symptoms generally severe and economical losses
significant. Terminating the outbreak before the lambing season will
indeed avoid the main potential damage. - Mod.AS]
