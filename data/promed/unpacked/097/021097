Reston ebolavirus (RESTV) should be considered a livestock pathogen with potential to affect other mammals, including people, according to National Institutes of Health scientists. The caution comes from a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in which the scientists found that experimental piglets infected with RESTV developed severe respiratory disease and shed the virus from the upper respiratory tract. RESTV can infect humans but is not known to cause disease. Now the scientists express concern that pigs could serve as an "interim or amplifying host for ebolaviruses."

"The emergence of RESTV in pigs is a wake-up call as transmission into humans through direct contact with pigs or the food chain is a possibility," they state in their study report. Scientists from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) conducted the work at Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana.

Scientists 1st identified RESTV in 1989 in research monkeys shipped from the Philippines to Reston, Virginia. The virus also gained attention in 2008 when an outbreak swept through pigs in the Philippines. That outbreak led to the 1st association of pig-to-human RESTV transmission, prompting the World Health Organization to issue a global alert in February 2009. RESTV sequences also have been identified in pigs in China, and the scientists suggest officials monitor pigs for disease throughout the Philippines and Southeast Asia.

The NIAID scientists conducted their study to answer 2 key questions: could they cause disease in young pigs -- mimicking natural infection with RESTV isolated from the 2008 swine outbreak? -- and if so, would those pigs shed virus through their respiratory tract?

Their work confirmed that in fact the pigs developed severe pneumonia with virus shedding from the upper respiratory tract. They also determined that the age of the piglets at the time of infection (they used animals between 3 and 7 weeks old) did not change the course of disease. Their work involved Yorkshire cross-bred pigs, which frequently are used in commercial pig production systems. RESTV has not been found in commercial pigs in the United States.

Continued studies in this project will examine whether co-infection with other swine viruses affects the ability of RESTV to cause severe disease in pigs and whether pigs have a broad role in hosting ebolaviruses.

[The paper's abstract follows:

"Reston virus (RESTV), an ebolavirus, causes clinical disease in macaques but has yet only been associated with rare asymptomatic infections in humans. Its 2008 emergence in pigs in the Philippines raised concerns about food safety, pathogenicity, and zoonotic potential, questions that are still unanswered. Until today [23 Nov 2020], the virulence of RESTV for pigs has remained elusive, with unclear pathogenicity in naturally infected animals and only one experimental study demonstrating susceptibility and evidence for shedding but no disease. Here we show that combined oropharyngeal and nasal infection of young (3- to 7-wk-old) Yorkshire cross pigs with RESTV resulted in severe respiratory disease, with most animals reaching humane endpoint within a week. RESTV-infected pigs developed severe cyanosis, tachypnea, and acute interstitial pneumonia, with RESTV shedding from oronasal mucosal membranes. Our studies indicate that RESTV should be considered a livestock pathogen with zoonotic potential."

The involvement of pigs in the epidemiology of Reston-Ebola virus (REBOV) was initially raised in 2008, when pig tissue and serum samples obtained from pigs, clinically suspected to suffer a PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak, were submitted from the Philippines to the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) of the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in Greenport, New York, USA for analysis. PRRS virus (arterivirus) that was isolated from these samples was found as close to the North American strain and 96-98% identical to the Chinese atypical strain. REBOV was coincidentally detected in 9 tissue samples using PCR. The samples were traced to 2 commercial farms in the Philippines. Samples were also submitted to the CDC and were confirmed by PCR and virus isolation. The event triggered continuing epidemiologic investigations among Philippine health and veterinary agencies in collaboration with international filovirus experts.

Parts of the above and additional details are covered in Ref 1.

The epidemiological information obtained by the recent NIH research demonstrates once more the importance and need of animal experimental infection trials.
