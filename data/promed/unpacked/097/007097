Today [12 Oct 2014], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed test results reported late last night by the Texas Department of State Health Services' public health laboratory showing that a healthcare worker at Texas Presbyterian Hospital is positive for Ebola. The healthcare worker, who provided care for the Dallas index patient, was isolated soon after symptoms started and remains so now. On Fri 10 Oct 2014, the healthcare worker reported a low-grade fever overnight and was referred for testing. The healthcare worker had been self-monitoring for fever and symptoms. As a precaution, after identification of fever, the healthcare worker was isolated, and CDC staff interviewed the patient to determine additional contacts or potential exposures. At this time, one close contact has been identified and is being monitored. The hospital and patient were notified of the preliminary and confirmatory test results. Treatment decisions will be made by the patient and hospital.

This development is understandably disturbing news for the patient, the patient's family and colleagues and the greater Dallas community. The CDC and the Texas Department of State Health Services remain confident that wider spread in the community can be prevented with proper public health measures, including ongoing contact tracing, health monitoring among those known to have been in contact with the index patient, and immediate isolations if symptoms develop.

Careful monitoring of all healthcare workers who had interaction with the index patient and this 2nd patient is warranted, including those who cared for the index patient between the time he was isolated in the hospital on 28 Sep 2014 through the time of his death on 8 Oct 2014, and they will now be considered patient contacts for follow-up monitoring.

Ebola is spread through direct contact with body fluids of a sick person or the remains of someone who has died of Ebola, or exposure to objects such as needles that have been contaminated. The illness has an average 8-10 day incubation period (although it could be from 2 to 21 days), and, therefore, CDC recommends monitoring exposed people for symptoms a complete 21 days. People are not contagious before symptoms such as fever develop.

[2] USA: Every health care facility must be able to handle a case

"Every U.S. health care facility needs to have the capability to initially handle a case," Abbigail Tumpey, a spokeswoman for the CDC, said. "Even if the patient is going to be transferred to another facility, they need to be able to handle the 1st moments of interacting with a patient."

Ms. Tumpey said the CDC would issue more specific instructions and explanations for how health care workers should properly put on and take off protective equipment. Among other things, the agency will urge nurses and doctors to enlist a co-worker or buddy to watch them handle protective clothing in a safe way. Proper handling of the equipment is crucial, Dr. Frieden said, because if the gear is contaminated, workers can infect themselves by touching it with bare hands.

Two other areas being examined, he said, were kidney dialysis and respiratory intubation of Ebola patients. Both procedures are considered high risk and may spread contaminated material...

[3] Fever not reliable as indicator of infection

For public health workers screening more than 1000 air travelers who arrive each week in the United States from Ebola-stricken West Africa, one symptom above all others is supposed to signal danger: fever. So long as an individual's temperature does not exceed 101.5 F [38.6 C] and there are no visible symptoms of Ebola [infection], health authorities say it should be assumed the person is not infectious...

[This is a discussion of Ebola outbreaks in Africa where up to 15 percent of confirmed cases were afebrile (without fever). But the amount of virus excreted increases in proportion to a fever, so at less than 101.5 degrees F, transmission is probably not very efficient. - Mod.JW]

[4] Spain: 3 more placed in quarantine, Madrid

Three more people who helped treat a nurse struck down with Ebola at a hospital in Spain have been placed in quarantine. The government confirmed that 16 people are now under observation at the hospital in Madrid after showing possible signs of the deadly virus.

The nurse, who is the 1st person to have contracted the disease outside of West Africa, is currently in a stable condition at Carlos III hospital. She had been part of the team treating 69-year-old Spanish priest MGV, who died of Ebola on 25 Sep 2014. Health officials believe the 16 people in isolation may have been in close contact with the nurse and could be infected too.

The 3 people placed in quarantine today [12 Oct 2014] are one of the nurses of the 1st infected nurse, a hairdresser who served her [before she was hospitalized], and a hospital cleaner.

[There has been interchangeable use of the terms quarantine and isolation in many of the reports available on the internet. As a reminder:
"Isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick.
Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick."
http://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/.

According to this media report it is not clear whether they are asymptomatic in quarantine or showing symptoms, in which case they should be in isolation. - Mod.MPP]
