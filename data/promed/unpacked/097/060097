The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (13 Mar 2015) received notification from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of a human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) affecting a man aged 46 in Sichuan.

According to the information provided by NHFPC, the patient is a poultry worker who lived in Suining. He developed a cough and chest discomfort on 18 Feb 2015. He attended a local hospital on 21 Feb 2015 and passed away on 27 Feb 2015. His specimen, which was tested by the relevant authority, was positive for avian influenza A(H5N1).

"Locally, we will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," a spokesman for the DH said.

Health surveillance measures have been implemented at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers and the DH also conducts temperature checks by handheld devices. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

Regarding health education for travellers, the display of posters and broadcasting of health messages in departure and arrival halls, environmental health inspection and provision of regular updates to the travel industry and other stakeholders are ongoing.

[From 2003 through 3 Mar 2015, 784 laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been officially reported to WHO from 16 countries. Of these cases, 429 have died.

Since the last WHO Influenza update on 26 Jan 2015, 66 new laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection, including 13 fatal cases, were reported to WHO from Egypt (65) and China (1).

Of the 65 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported from Egypt, 29 had onset of disease in January [2015] and the rest had onset of disease in February [2015]. The cases were reported from 18 different governorates of Egypt (see table 1 in URL below). The age range of the 65 cases is from 1 to 75 years, with a median of 26 years, and 23 per cent of the cases are under 10 years of age. All cases had exposure to poultry or poultry markets, were hospitalized and all but one reportedly received treatment with antiviral medication. Of the newly reported cases, there was 1 cluster which included 2 confirmed cases in a mother and daughter from Fayoum governorate. The mother had an onset of illness 2 days prior to the daughter's onset of illness and both had exposure to backyard poultry.

Currently, there are reports of an increased number of outbreaks and detections of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry in Egypt compared to previous months and compared to this month in previous years.

The number of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in Egypt with onsets of illness in the months of December 2014, January and February 2015 are the highest numbers reported by any country in a single month. Although all influenza viruses evolve over time, preliminary laboratory investigation has not detected major genetic changes in the viruses isolated from the patients or animals compared to previously circulating isolates, but further in-depth analysis is ongoing. A new candidate vaccine virus was proposed to better protect against the current circulating H5 clade 2.2.1. viruses (a group which all the recent influenza A( H5N1) virus isolates from Egypt belong to; see http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201502_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf?ua=1).

The increase in the number of human cases is likely attributable to a mixture of factors, including increased circulation of influenza A(H5N1) viruses in poultry, lower public health awareness of risks in middle and upper Egypt and seasonal factors such as closer proximity to poultry because of cold weather and possible longer survival of the viruses in the environment. A high-level joint WHO/FAO/OIE mission to Egypt to assess the risks associated with the influenza A(H5N1) viruses and to recommend control measures is planned for early March 2015.

China reported a human infection with an avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in a 37-year-old woman from Jiangsu province. She developed symptoms on 14 Jan 2015, was admitted to hospital on 20 Jan [2015]. The patient had a history of exposure to poultry. No further cases among contacts were reported. [This was the 1st report of human infection with A(H5N1) in China in 2015.]

China reported a human infection with an avian influenza A(H5N6) virus in a 44-year-old man from Yunnan province. He developed symptoms on 27 Jan 2015, was admitted to hospital on 3 Feb [2015], and passed away on 6 Feb [2015]. The patient had a history of exposure to dead wild birds. No further cases among contacts were reported. This is the 3rd human case of influenza A(H5N6) reported from China.

Various influenza A(H5) subtypes, such as influenza A(H5N1), A(H5N2), A(H5N3), A(H5N6) and A(H5N8), have recently been detected in birds in Europe, North America, and Asia, according to reports received by OIE. Although these influenza A(H5) viruses might have the potential to cause disease in humans, so far no human cases of infection have been reported, with exception of the human infections with influenza A(H5N1) viruses and the 3 human infections with influenza A(H5N6) virus detected in China since 2014.

Overall public health risk assessment for avian influenza A(H5) viruses
---------------------------

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, sporadic infections and small clusters of human cases are possible in people exposed to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Although an increased number of animal-to-human infections have been reported by Egypt over the past few months, these influenza A(H5) viruses do not currently appear to transmit easily among people. As such, the risk of community-level spread of these viruses remains to be low.

See Figure 1 in url below: Epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset.

From: WHO: Influenza at the human-animal interface, summary and assessment as of 3 Mar 2015 [edited]
http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/HAI_Risk_Assessment/en/

Despite being the probable birthplace of H5N1, and having both the world's largest population and the greatest number of poultry -- for reasons that are less than clear -- China remains only 5th on the list of countries with the most reported human H5N1 cases, trailing well behind Egypt, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia.

This disparity is even greater when you factor in the differences in population, making the incidence of H5N1 in Egypt more than 90 times higher (per capita) than reported in China.

Why this should be so isn't known, although some of the theories offered include:
- Differences in H5N1 clades in circulation (China is predominantly 2.3.2 & 2.3.4 while Egypt is 2.2.1)
- Differences in how poultry are kept and raised between the 2 countries
- Suspected weaknesses or deficits in surveillance and reporting from within China

Whatever the reason, over the past 5 years China has only reported an average of 2 human H5N1 cases a year.
