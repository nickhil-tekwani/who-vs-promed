Measles might be preparing for a comeback tour. Unlike Ebola, measles easily leaps between people. Virus-filled droplets linger, floating in the air or coating a coffee table for up to 2 hours after a contagious person coughs or sneezes. If you're susceptible to the disease and you breath that air or touch a contaminated surface and then rub your eyes, you'll come down with measles.

Measles infects 90 percent of those who are not immune. And it's not just a week of misery that results. Before a vaccine was developed in the 1960s, measles caused more than 2 million deaths per year, typically when the virus severely infects the lungs or brain. That's why the globe has tried so hard since 2000 to eliminate the disease. Since 2000, vaccination initiatives have prevented 15.6 million deaths, mostly of children under age 5. So measles had been on a steady decline.

But since 2007, the numbers have stayed about the same. Last year [2013], the global death tally jumped to 145 000 deaths versus 122 000 in 2012, according to a new report published by the World Health Organization. That means nearly 400 kids die from measles each day. In 2013, more than 70 percent of measles deaths were confined to 6 countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan. Even survivors can pay a price, with long-term consequences like blindness, brain damage and hearing loss.

The West Pacific is losing ground, too, says the report. For instance, The Philippines has recorded a tremendous outbreak in 2014 with over 50 000 cases. One reason for this trend is the global recession. Even though a measles vaccine costs only USD 1.00 per child in developing countries, the economic downturn has taken a toll. Rather than hold a measles vaccination campaign every 2 to 3 years, some countries stretch that to every 5 years, says James Goodson, a measles epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who coauthored last week's report. The result is a greater pool of susceptible children and more cases. We've seen a large outbreak in the DRC, for example, that started in 2010 and continued through 2012 as a result of a delayed campaign," says Goodson. Europe is now reporting measles cases in older children and young adults. To quell future outbreaks in teens, a nationwide vaccination campaign was launched, which cut cases by 80 percent the following year.

The U.S. is also breaking measles records. This year [2014] has seen 603 cases so far, more than in any single year in the past 2 decades. William Moss, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, says some parents won't vaccinate their children no matter what is said, but others may have forgotten the risks of measles and so are swayed by anti-vaccine hokum.

WHO's plan had been to eliminate measles altogether by 2020. That goal is now in peril. "For example, the African region, Eastern Mediterranean region, and the European region are not on track to achieve their measles elimination targets by 2020," says Goodson. Moss doesn't expect measles to rebound to pre-2000 levels but warns: "Unless we make further investments into vaccine campaigns, we'll continue to see large outbreaks."

As of 31 Oct 2014, there were 20 outbreaks and 603 individual cases of measles in 22 states, including Minnesota, which has had 2 reported cases so far this year [2014].

The United States has experienced a record number of measles cases this year [2014], the highest number since 2000. All outbreaks of measles since 2000 have occurred after people traveling to other countries became infected with the virus and then brought it back to the United States. The average person with measles would be capable of infecting 12 to 18 other people if all of his or her contacts were unvaccinated or hadn't developed immunity by already having had the disease, experts say.

In the United States, an estimated 0.1 to 0.3 percent of people who develop measles die from its complications. In the developing world, the death rate from the disease can be as high as 15 percent. A single dose of the measles vaccine, if given before the 2nd year of life, is 94 percent effective at preventing the disease. Two doses administered on or after a child's 1st birthday and spaced at least a month apart protect almost everybody against measles for life.

The CDC, in conjunction with the World Health Organization, also issued an international report last week that had mixed news about measles. Between 2000 and 2013, vaccination programs have led to a 72 percent decline in the global incidence rate for measles and a 75 percent drop in the disease's death rate. During that 13-year period, an estimated 15.6 million measles-related deaths were prevented, a stunning accomplishment. But that progress has stalled. What happens overseas has a direct effect on measles outbreaks in the United States. For as 2 health experts note in a commentary published on 30 Oct 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the contraction of the disease by susceptible U.S. residents travelling overseas is one of the major reasons behind the rising number of cases that are occurring here. The other reason: the increasing number of U.S. parents who refuse or delay having their children vaccinated.

Measles in Minnesota: The MDH [Minnesota Department of Health] is alarmed by the reported national jump this year [2014] in measles cases. With the exception of 2011, in which Minnesota had a measles outbreak of 21 cases, we have had an average of about one case per year since 2000. When there are more and more cases in the United States, there is a higher chance that Minnesota will also have cases as a result of people spreading measles to others during domestic travel.

In Minnesota, we have had 2 reported cases of confirmed measles in 2014. Measles is not a disease that is endemic in Minnesota, meaning it is not currently spreading among the population. MDH investigates suspect rash illness cases, and laboratories and health-care providers are required by law to report suspect cases of measles immediately to MDH so that we can collect the proper lab specimens and take immediate public health action if it turns into a case.

The 1st case contracted measles while traveling overseas and then transmitted measles to the 2nd case (an adult business traveler) in passing at a U.S. airport gate. Both cases were confirmed by laboratory testing and had illnesses that were clinically compatible with measles, including high fever and maculopapular rash.

The 1st case was an age-appropriately vaccinated child with one dose of MMR, and represents the 2-5 percent of individuals who do not respond to the 1st dose (primary vaccine failure, which is why a 2nd dose of MMR is routinely recommended). The 2nd case had unknown vaccination status and is part of a large group of Americans born between 1963 and 1978 who may have received a far less effective version of the MMR vaccine.

More than 90 percent of Minnesota kindergarteners were vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, hepatitis B and chickenpox for the 2013-14 school year. MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rates are steady from previous years; they have hovered at around 90 percent.

For the most part, we see level immunization rates, but, of course, we would like to see them inching upward. Most parents vaccinate their children. Parents who delay some vaccinations put their child at risk for serious diseases that can be prevented. Once those diseases are in your community, it may be too late for their child to get vaccinated. MDH does keep an eye out for areas where vaccine refusal is higher. This is done through the Annual Immunization School Report (AISR). Schools are a place where diseases can spread quickly among children who are unvaccinated.

Vaccination is one of the most amazing public health accomplishments that have happened in the past century. In years past, parents dreaded the diseases we no longer see. Measles is no exception.

Two children died after suffering from measles in the Uthal area of Lasbela, the medical superintendent of Uthal Hospital told The Express Tribune newspaper.

Ten other children are also affected by the disease in the area. The preventable disease has so far killed 16 children and affected more than 400 children in Balochistan since April 2014. At least 12 children were brought to the hospital after suffering from measles. Two children died, and 10 are admitted in the hospital. The suffering children are in a separate ward of Uthal Hospital and out of danger, the superintendent said.

The affected children are residents of a remote village, Kangra in Uthal, which is home for around 25 families. The outbreak is in this village only, and other villages are safe but vulnerable, sources said. The people who live there are very poor and have mud houses where vaccination against the preventable disease could not be launched due to a lack of funding.

The parents of the suffering children did not know about the disease until it badly affected their children. According to the Health Department, measles killed 43 people and affected more than 700 children in 2013. There have been no campaigns against measles in Balochistan for the past 2 years, as the government has yet to allocate its due share of money in order to launch the anti-measles campaign in the province.

The Balochistan Health Minister claimed that the health department has finalised its plan regarding an anti-measles campaign which would be started during the month of November [2014] on an emergency basis.

Two infants have died as a result of a measles outbreak here in Pasede Khel, the remote and bordering area of tehsil Landi Kotal of the Khyber Agency, the affected family sources reported on Sunday [16 Nov 2014]. The sources said that 2 children, aged one and 3, died of measles within 2 days of onset of their illnesses.

The uncle of one of the boys said that every 3rd child in every house in Pasede Khel is suffering from measles, and the disease has turned into an epidemic. Morga, Madi Khel, Ghbargi Khel and Shegi Khel are the worst effected villages of the area, he disclosed. Routine vaccination has not been done properly, and only selective immunization has been undertaken.

According to a local parent, responsibility for treatment has been relocated to hospitals in Landi Kotal and Peshawar. Dr. Feroz Shah said: "Lack of health awareness in the community, especially among women, is the main cause of spread of the disease. When Dr. Rehman, Surgeon for the Khyber Agency, was contacted on the issue, he confirmed the occurrence of the outbreak and the 2 deaths. He stated that emergency vaccination teams had been dispatched to the area a week ago and had been carrying out vaccination in the affected area.

State health officials [in Hawaii] say the count of cases in this latest measles outbreak is now up to a dozen. The latest case turned up here in Honolulu. It's the 2nd adult case on Oahu this month [November 2014].

Health department [DOH] officials only learned of the cases after the test came back positive. DOH says it can't stress enough the importance of early reporting. "You need to engage us because the time is ticking to then talk to these individuals to find out who they might have been around that were infected," said Dr. Sarah Park of the state DOH.

This 2nd case also had no history of travel, so right now, it can't be linked to the cases on the neighboring islands. Park says one of the Oahu cases may have been in contact with more than 90 people. She advises people to make sure they have been vaccinated and that some may need 2 shots.

The Sunshine Coast Public Health Unit has been notified of a confirmed case of measles of someone attending a church service at Nambour last Sunday. The person attended St Joseph's Catholic Church 9 am Mass, Nambour on Sun 16 Nov 2014. "People sitting near the front of the church are most likely to have been exposed," the health service said in a statement.

Those people who were born after 1965 and who are sure they have not been vaccinated with a measles vaccine or had measles have been advised to obtain an injection of immunoglobulin from Nambour Clinic Family Medicine on Sydney St, Nambour this afternoon or tomorrow [21-22 Nov 2014] morning before 10 am.

"This is particularly important for children too young to be immunised, pregnant women and people with medical conditions or treatment that have suppressed the immune system," The Sunshine Coast Public Health Unit said in a statement. The immunoglobulin is derived from human serum and is intended to provide protection against this exposure to measles. If people wish to have measles, mumps, rubella or chickenpox vaccination in future, they will have to wait for at least 5 months after receiving the immunoglobulin.
