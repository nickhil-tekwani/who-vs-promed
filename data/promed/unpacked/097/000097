[In response to the query of Debora MacKenzie on 19 May, 2004 posted in
ProMED-mail post Exotic disease risk, travelling pets (02) - UK
20040524.1386 on 24 May 2004, as to whether there are phlebotomine
sandflies in the UK - Mod.MS]

Absence of phlebotomine sandflies from England
---------------------------------------------
When I was running a light-trap on Brownsea island, Poole harbour, Dorset,
UK, in the early 1960s to catch mosquitoes and _Culicoides_ midges, the
late Dr David J. Lewis (an expert on sandflies) asked me to check whether
there were any phlebotomine sandflies in the catches. Because, he said,
that in 1923 a sandfly had been recorded on Jersey island, in the English
Channel. I have as yet been unable to discover what the species was, who
caught it (or them), or whether this record was published. But I never
found any sandflies in my collections on Brownsea island.
As far as mainland Britain is concerned, there are no records of sandflies.
The other query from Debora MacKenzie concerned the risk of "kennel-ticks"
becoming enzootic in the UK. I am unsure what "kennel-ticks" are. Some
call the dog tick _Ixodes canisuga_ the kennel-tick, but this is not
regarded as an important vector species. However, I imagine that what is
meant in this context is probably _Rhipicephalus sanguineus_, a widely
distributed species and an important vector.
In Europe the 3 subspecies/subtypes of _Babesia canis_ are transmitted by
_Dermacentor_ and _Rhipicephalus_ tick species, mainly _D. reticulatus_ and
_R. sanguineus_ (the common or brown dog tick). I understand that _R.
sanguineus_ has been recorded as becoming established in quarantine kennels
in southern England, and I believe wild specimens have been caught outside
the kennels. Dogs travelling on a "pet passport" need to have an officially
recognised certificate to say they have been treated with an approved
acaricide before they are allowed to return to the UK, otherwise on arrival
they go into quarantine.
