A police officer is fighting for his life, Scotland Yard have revealed, as they confirmed that the "substance" used against Russian spy Colonel Sergei Skripal and his daughter was a nerve agent.

Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley made the announcement, hours after the Home Secretary suggested investigators were close to a breakthrough.

Mr Rowley said the poisoning was being treated as attempted murder and said the pair had been "targeted specifically". Mr Rowley said: "In summary, this is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder by administration of a nerve agent. "As you know, these 2 people remain critically ill in hospital.

"Sadly, in addition, a police officer who was one of the first to attend the scene and respond to the incident is now also in a serious condition in hospital. "Wiltshire Police are, of course, providing every support to his family.

"Whilst we are now in a position to confirm their symptoms are as a result of exposure to a nerve agent, I will not be providing further information at this stage about the exact substance which has been identified."

Following the meeting, Amber Rudd said Scotland Yard would be revealing more details on the Salisbury investigation later on [Wed 7 Mar 2018].

She had been chairing a meeting of Cobra [emergency briefings] in Whitehall to discuss the crisis as Col Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, continue to fight for their lives in hospital.

Ms Rudd said: "This is likely to be a lengthy and ongoing process. We need to make sure that the police and the other services have the space to continue that investigation.

"We need to keep a cool head and make sure that we collect all the evidence we can and we need to make sure that we respond not to rumour but to all the evidence that they collect and then we will need to decide what action to take."

The Home Secretary added: "We do know more about the substance and the police will be making a further statement this afternoon in order to share some of that.

"We must let the police carry on their work. They will share what they can this afternoon [8 Mar 2018], but I am sure there will be more updates as the investigation continues."

Scotland Yard counter-terror officers further extended cordons in the city overnight, while scientists at Porton Down, the UK's military research facility, continue their investigation.

Earlier, emergency services had to be called to an office in central Salisbury on [Wed 7 Mar 2018] lunchtime following reports that a person had been taken seriously ill.

Three fire engines and at least 2 ambulance incident response arrived at offices close to Zizzi's restaurant on Castle Street, Salisbury.

That the substance could be a nerve agent was one theory being explored. The deadly nerve agent, VX, was used last year [2017] in the murder of Kim Jong-nam [North Korean leader's half-brother].

The high-profile investigation is entering its 4th day after Col Skripal and [his daughter] were found unconscious shortly after 4 pm on [Sun 4 Mar 2018].

They are thought to have been exposed to the substance as they sat on a bench outside a shopping centre. [Since they believe they were targeted and it can be aerosolized, then hopefully security cameras will find someone passing near them who may be the culprit or culprits. - Mod.TG]

In an update on Wednesday morning [7 Mar 2018], detectives urged anybody who visited Salisbury town centre on Sunday afternoon [4 Mar 2018] or who visited a Zizzi restaurant or the Bishop's Mill pub to come forward.

A bridge in Salisbury, Wiltshire, was shut on Tuesday evening [6 Mar 2018], while police were on Wednesday morning seen at Zizzi restaurant, where the pair are said to have eaten on Sunday.

Colonel Sergei Skripal was given refuge in the UK as part of a spy swap Scotland Yard had said detectives were "keeping an open mind as to what happened", and that the incident had not been declared a terrorist incident -- adding that it would not "provide a running commentary" on the investigation.

The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in nearby Porton Down, which has state-of-the-art equipment to look for trace amounts of substances, is believed to have been involved in examining what could have caused Mr Skripal and his daughter to fall ill.

Mr Skripal was convicted in 2006 of passing state secrets to MI6 before being given refuge in the UK as part of a spy swap.

[When I read in some accounts of the medical responders contacting the victims and having itching, reddening skin and eyes, and tearing, I thought one of the several known nerve agents may be involved. Most of the nerve agents block acetylcholinesterase of the nerves causing them to continue to fire. Atropine is one treatment. There will surely be more about this in the coming days.

VX is a nerve agent and was involved in the killing of the half-brother of North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un in 2017. It is a very rapid acting agent and the victim was unable to be treated in a timely fashion and died.

Hopefully these current victims are getting appropriate treatment and will recover. - Mod.TG
