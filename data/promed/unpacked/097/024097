I am writing in response to the ProMED-mail post from David Stevenson
regarding the treatment of donovanosis with streptomycin.
Our experience with donovanosis in the Northern Territory, Australia until
1995 relied on erythromycin 800 mg bd for 28 days or doxycyline 200 mg
daily for 28 days, with the response limited by patient compliance.
Since 1995, the standard treatment has been azithromycin 500 mg daily for 7
days or 1 gram once a week for 4 weeks. Either regime is equally effective
in cure to the point where virtually normal anatomy can be restored (albeit
with some residual scarring), without the need for plastic surgery. While I
appreciate the difficulty of primary treatment with a relatively expensive
drug, in the long term this could prove to be a cheaper option.
