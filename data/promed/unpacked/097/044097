Requirements for serological confirmation of a viral infection
--------------------------------------------------------------
The 30 July posting on Nipah virus [Nipah virus, rationale for culling pigs
2000.3036 from Dr. Ken Lam contained supporting comments from former Viral
Diseases Moderator C.H. Calisher, who was and is strongly insistent that
serological confirmation of a viral infection cannot be made with a single
serum sample... not for any virus infection". This statement is correct,
important, and needs to be more widely appreciated by ProMED readers.
In this modern era of proliferating serologic testing for viral antibody,
often performed by private laboratories or based on mass-produced kits and
reagents, it is important to remind ourselves periodically that serologic
tests for anti-viral antibody are, at best, imperfect and subject to many
potential errors that can only be adequately dealt with by cautious
informed interpretation. Drs. Calisher and Lam have mentioned some of the
things that can go wrong with IgM testing, but there are others. That's
just the state of the art in IgM and whole serum serology: the problem is
not so much poor tests as the reality that in serology almost anything that
could possibly go wrong eventually will. To put it in the context of
American football, there is the old injunction [referring to incompletions
and interceptions, that anytime you pass the ball three things can happen,
and two of them are bad. So it is with serologies, which too often produce
false negatives and false positives, may sometimes do so at a high rate,
and may do so in a setting where "gold standard" or "brass standard"
confirmation (e.g., by viral isolation or PCR) is not always easy to get.
One of the common problems seen nowadays in public health and commercial
settings, and of great importance for public health surveillance and
epidemic detection, is false positivity in IgM antibody detection. One
could probably fairly say that in almost all tests for IgM antibody to
virtually all viruses, if enough samples are tested -- and "enough" might
only be 20 or so for certain tests -- some of them will turn up as false
positives. While it may be important to err on the side of
over-interpretation in a clinical setting which demands a prompt decision
to start or withhold therapy, in public health contexts there are
consequences to a trigger-happy approach. There have been, in recent years,
any number of epidemic false alarms based on single IgM positive tests for
epidemic viruses. Some of these have caused anxiety, confusion, and wasted
action. False alarms also destroy public confidence.
There can be no single equation for how to deal with IgM positive results
in surveillance settings when confirmatory serologic, virologic, and
epidemiologic information are lacking. I would suggest, however, that they
should always be interpreted with caution and that, where possible,
consequent public health decisions be delayed until more information can be
assembled.
