Fusarium detected in wheat at central region and southern coast
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Agricultural Planning Institute warned producers about the
presence of fusarium fungus in wheat crops in the central region and
southern coast of the country. The prevailing climatic situation,
humidity, and temperature are very favourable for the multiplication
of the pathogen and infection of wheat heads. The disease causes loss
of yield and milling quality, the statement said.

It notes that contaminated grain creates problems for its use in food
and feedstuffs because of the possible production of mycotoxins (DON,
T1, T2, etc). The institute recommends that wheat producers closely
monitor their development each week. Since these crops may also be
destined for storage, it is considered necessary to perform analyses
for mycotoxins. It also suggests consulting technical experts so that
the appropriate decisions can be taken.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also called scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Current names of the
fungi are _Gibberella zeae_, _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_
var. _nivalis_, and _Microdochium majus_. FHB causes yield losses of
up to 45 percent in small grain crops (such as wheat, barley, oats,
maize) and reduces the grade of harvested grain.

Depending on the fungal species or strains involved, as well as on
environmental factors during plant growth and grain storage, scab
infection may also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins. The
produced mycotoxins include for example DON (also called vomitoxin)
which can affect stock and may lead to reduced feed consumption or
feed refusal. The total crop may be lost if grain is rejected because
of toxin levels. Disease management includes timely fungicide
applications and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.
