Farmers in the districts of Kibuku and Budaka (eastern region) are counting losses following the outbreak of a disease that is ravaging orange crops. It is spreading at an alarming rate and is suspected to be citrus canker.

Some farmers have suffered total crop loss. Extension workers are visiting farms to carry out assessments. In some areas, 70% of orange farmers have been affected so far. Agricultural officials said samples of the affected trees had been taken to various research centres, but they were yet to get a response.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacteria _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (Xac; synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_) or _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ (Xaa), depending on the region. The disease is now present in most citrus-growing areas worldwide.

CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family Rutaceae. Different Xac strains can vary in host specificity, for example lime-specific strains that do not affect orange or grapefruit (ProMED post 20170920.5330396). CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves, and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacteria can be transmitted by mechanical means, water, or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bacteriocidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves, which can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry, may also be used to reduce CC incidence. Research on developing biocontrol methods is being carried out (for example, see link below).

Antibiotic sprays are used occasionally for CC management but are subject to strict regulations in most countries due to their associated risks of facilitating the emergence of antibiotic resistances in other crop, animal, and human pathogens. Furthermore, beneficial soil microbes may be killed off as collateral damage, making the plants weaker and more susceptible to other diseases. Residues of antibiotics may also lead to rejection of exported produce by some countries.

In neighbouring Sudan, a number of strains of Xac have been reported on different citrus varieties (see ProMED post 20170920.5330396). Further research is needed to characterise these strains. A potential connection between outbreaks in the 2 countries and the region overall should be considered.

Other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
