Montana: first probable human cases of West Nile virus infection
----------------------------------------------------------------
HELENA: Four Montanans have tested positive for West Nile virus, marking
the first probable human cases contracted in the state, a state official
said on Thursday. Dr Michael Spence, the state's chief medical officer,
said the state health laboratory detected the positive cases on Thu 14 Aug
2003. They are 2 men and 2 women from Blaine, Custer, Fallon and Stillwater
counties, he said. The ages of the patients range from 12 to 61, he added.
Spence said at least 3 of them were in hospital and state health officials
would monitor their condition. The state technically will not count the
instances as official cases of West Nile virus infection until confirmed by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 7 to 10 days, but Spence
said health officials presume them to be cases of West Nile virus infection.
Spence said the first human case of the virus in Montana was expected, as
the number of cases nationwide continue to explode and move westward. Last
week alone, 400 new cases were diagnosed, a threefold increase over the
week before, he said. Spence said more Montanans may have been infected,
but never displayed any symptoms. Over 90 per cent of those who get the
disease never know they have it, he said.
Last year, 2 human cases of West Nile were confirmed in the state, but they
were believed to have contracted the virus elsewhere. Montana's first case
of West Nile virus infection was confirmed in August 2002 in a Yellowstone
County horse. Last year, 134 horses in 26 counties were diagnosed with the
disease. Of those, 38 died or were euthanized.
