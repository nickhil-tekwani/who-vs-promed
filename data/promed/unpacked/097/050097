[In 2014 and 2016, outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N8 were observed among wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide.

A novel HPAI H5N6 was detected in wild birds and commercial poultry in the Netherlands in December 2017, and since then it continues to occur across Europe. It has so far showed up in the UK, Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, Slovakia, and Finland.

In Denmark, the virus was confirmed infecting several different wild birds, in August and September 2018. This continued occurrence of outbreaks reveals the potential for HPAI virus A(H5N6) to remain present in free-living wild birds for several months after the peak of outbreaks and emphasizes the need for continued surveillance. - Mod.PMB
