A total of 7 people, including a child and 2 women, acquired paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) after eating sunset shell or "sulib" contaminated by red tide toxin gathered at the Manila Bay area in this town [Samal, Bataan] early this week.

Danilo Abrera, fisheries division chief of the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist, said his office disseminated the information on the shellfish ban on 4 Nov 2013 to all mayors, municipal and city fisheries councils, and other government agencies. "We did everything. We did not miss in disseminating the information about the shellfish ban. That's why we were surprised that this incident happened. May this serve as lesson to all and hopefully, there will be no more to follow," he said.

Two men gathered the sulib and prepared it in a drinking session with 2 others, all from Barangay Sapa [in Samal]. All 4 victims complained of numbness of body and lips and were rushed to the district hospital in Orani town. An 11 year old girl and 2 adult women also ate "adobong sulib" bought from the men and were also confined at the Orani district hospital.

"I ate adobong sulib at around 7:30 pm Monday [11 Nov 2013] and at around 2 am Tuesday [12 Nov 2013], I felt numbness on my feet and arms," one said. "I felt dizzy as if there was an earthquake," another added. The victims said they ate from 2 to 6 spoonfuls of the shellfish Monday afternoon and felt pains the next morning.

Dr Rosalie Manubay, assistant chief of the Orani District Hospital, said the symptoms registered were those of shellfish poisoning. She said the victims were all given medication and placed under observation.

The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources issued an advisory during the previous week banning the gathering, selling, transporting, and eating of shellfish in the whole of Bataan after samples of shellfish gathered showed high toxicity level beyond the tolerable limit. The affected towns are Orani, Samal, Abucay, Pilar, Orion, Limay, and Mariveles, and the city of Balanga -- all coastal areas facing Manila Bay in Bataan.

[Sulib or sunset shell is a West Indian marine bivalve having a smooth shell marked with radiating bands of varied colors resembling those seen at sunset or before sunrise and is also called rising sun; see photo at http://www.interaksyon.com/assets/images/articles/interphoto_1330825930.jpg.

Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) (http://aquaticpath.umd.edu/toxalg/psp.html) is a significant problem on both the east and west coasts of the USA and many other coastal areas of the world. Caused by several closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in filter feeding shellfish, but they also move through the food chain, affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and marine mammals. Overall, PSP affects more coastline than any other harmful algal bloom problem.

It is likely that seasonally recurring outbreaks of PSP are linked to the existence of a dormant cyst stage in the _Alexandrium_ life history. This strategy allows the species to deposit dormant cells in sediments where they survive through harsh winter conditions and then germinate to initiate new outbreaks in subsequent years. Prior to 1972, for example, PSP was restricted to the far eastern sections of Maine ("down east") near the Canadian border. That year, however, a massive red tide causing high levels of toxicity in those areas for the 1st time recorded in history. Virtually every year since that event, this region has experienced PSP outbreaks, a result of the successful colonization of the area by _Alexandrium_ spp. A similar expansion, with subsequent recurring outbreaks of _Alexandrium_, occurred in the Puget Sound region of Washington in the late 1970s an area with no prior history of shellfish poisoning. Long-term climatic variability, which affects temperature, upwelling, and currents or allows cysts to survive in areas where they did not before, may be factors in such range extensions.

Shellfish that have caused this disease include mussels, cockles, clams, scallops, oysters, crabs, and lobsters. Symptoms begin anywhere from 15 minutes to 10 hours after eating the contaminated shellfish, although usually within 2 hours. Symptoms are generally mild, and begin with numbness or tingling of the face, arms, and legs. This is followed by headache, dizziness, nausea, and muscular incoordination. Patients sometimes describe a floating sensation. In cases of severe poisoning, muscle paralysis and respiratory failure occur, and in these cases death may occur in 2 to 25 hours. - Mod.LL
