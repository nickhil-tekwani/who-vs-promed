Plant disease ravages Isabela rice farms
-----------------------------------------
Agricultural workers in Isabela have doubled their efforts to
disseminate information among farmers on how to battle a rice plant
disease that has now plagued more than 3000 hectares [approx 7400
acres] of the province. Based on initial reports, bacterial leaf
streak has affected the towns of Burgos, San Mateo, and Ramon.
Occasional instances have been recorded in other towns and in Cauayan City.

"The rice farms are still in a recoverable stage. We hope that the
farmers can immediately spray bacteriocides," said agriculturist
Danilo Tumamao. Andrew Villacorta, agriculture regional director,
said the office has been distributing bacteriocides [to affected
farmers]. Technicians have already been deployed throughout the
province to record and validate data.

Similar to the bacterial leaf blight, bacterial leaf streak has also
wreaked havoc in neighboring provinces such as Cagayan, Quirino, and
Nueva Vizcaya.

[Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_. It occurs in Asia and West Africa and yield
losses of up to 30 percent have been recorded. Symptoms include
translucent interveinal streaks extending to become orange lesions
which may kill the leaf. Yellowish bacterial exudates may be seen.
Bacteria may enter through small wounds on the leaf surface,
including insect damage. Plants are susceptible at all stages, but
infection is most damaging at the tillering stage. BLS is more
prevalent in the rainy season.

The pathogen survives between seasons on volunteer rice and leaf
debris. It is seed borne and can also be spread with infected plant
and other materials, by water (rain, irrigation), and mechanical
means (including insect activity). Disease management is difficult
and may include phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice
reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural
measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers), bacteriocides (such
as copper compounds), and use of resistant crop varieties.

Another strain of the pathogen, _X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_, causes
bacterial leaf blight (BLB). Symptoms are similar but BLB is
generally considered more invasive.
