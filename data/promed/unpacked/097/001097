Between 20 and 30 cases of _Salmonella brandenburg_ in sheep flocks have
been confirmed in Canterbury over recent weeks, but the number of cases may
be higher. Lincoln veterinary pathologist Jim Hutton said the confirmed
cases being sent to the lab had tailed off but that did not mean there were
not any more cases arising.
He said as veterinarians became more familiar with the disease there was
less need to confirm it using the lab's services. It was likely the real
numbers were closer to 40.The number of confirmed cases involved a mixture
of new cases as well as re-occurring ones. Some of these were in flocks
that had been vaccinated.
_Salmonella brandenburg_ causes ewes to abort their lambs, and often the
ewes also died. It can be passed on to humans.
Outbreaks have been suspected of being spread to flocks by black-backed
gulls. Ewes that survived the disease sometimes became carriers without
showing any clinical signs themselves. These animals can pass the bacteria
in their faeces and spread it to other animals.
Culverden vet John Turner said he was pleased he had not seen any positive
signs of the disease. "We have been keeping an eye out for it because
there had been confirmed cases as far north as Darfield and Oxford. A
normal number of cases involving ewes aborting had occurred but none were
related to _Salmonella brandenburg_," he said.
