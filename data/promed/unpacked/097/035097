Outbreak of typhoid fever in Shakhtyorsk, Donetsk Region
---------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of typhoid fever has been recorded in Shakhtyorsk, a district
center in [the] Donetsk Region. Seven people, among them a ten-year-old
child, have been brought to the local hospital with symptoms of the
disease, an official in the press service of the Ukrainian Ministry for
Emergencies told Itar-Tass on Thursday. According to a preliminary version,
the pollution [contamination] of potable water which the victims used for
cooking could become the most likely cause of the disease. The situation is
being studied by epidemiologists who urgently came to Shakhtyorsk.
