Afghanistan has asked the World Health Organization for help dealing with an
epidemic that is killing dozens of people a day near the Tajik border in
Afghanistan, an official said Friday [19 Feb 1999.
A U.N. spokesman in New York said the WHO would send two epidemiologists to
the affected region.
The illness, thought perhaps to be plague or cholera, has spread during the
past week through several improverished villages in the Badakhshan mountains
of Afghanistan.
A lack of qualified medical personnel and diagnostic equipment have
complicated efforts to identify the disease, said Ibrahim Khikmat, an Afghan
Embassy spokesman in Tajikistan, according to the Interfax news agency.
Dozens of people are dying every day, he was quoted as saying.
U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters in New York that the WHO would
send the epidemiologists Saturday to Dushanbe, Tajikistan. From there they
will travel by helicopter to as many of the four affected villages as they
can reach.
Local authorities in Faisalabad, Pakistan, have also arranged for a
helicopter and were to fly to the affected areas Friday with a WHO staffer
from Faisalabad.
Khikmat said Afghanistan has a tentative agreement with Russian border
guards to bring doctors and medicine by helicopter to the affected regions.
Aaccording to Eckhard, the first reports of the epidemic were received a
week ago from local authorities in the village of Darwaz who reported 2000
cases and 150 deaths. Symptoms of the epidemic are fever, cough, pain
vomiting and diarrhea, with elderly women and children the worst affected,
he said.
