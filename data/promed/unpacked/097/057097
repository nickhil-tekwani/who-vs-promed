Antigenic and genetic characteristics of zoonotic influenza A viruses and development of candidate vaccine viruses for pandemic preparedness -- February 2020
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Influenza A(H9N2) activity from 24 Sep 2019 to 24 Feb 2020
----------------------------------------------------------
Five human cases of A(H9N2) virus infections were reported in this period. 2 cases, one each from India and Senegal, had illness onset dates from the previous reporting period. These were the 1st reports of human infections with A(H9N2) viruses from these countries. The 3 other new cases were reported by China (2) and Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, China (1) and were from the Y280/G9 lineage. All cases recovered.

H9N2 viruses are avian influenza of low pathogenicity (LPAIV, "low pathogenic avian influenza virus"), a subtype found worldwide in wild birds while becoming endemic in poultry in many areas of Eurasia and Africa. Compared to H5 and H7 viruses, of which many are of high pathogenicity in poultry (HPAIV), they are somewhat neglected. This is partially the outcome of LPAIV strains, such as H9N2, being -- in difference with HPAIV viruses -- pathogens which are not OIE notifiable, causing relatively few overt human infections though significant economic losses.

In many resource-limited regions surveillance is performed sporadically, or not at all. It is likely that H9N2 viruses are present, or endemic, in more countries, particularly in low- and middle-income countries in Africa and Asia; Senegal seems to be a recent example. A map presenting the distribution of the virus in Eurasia and Africa, as of June 2019, is available in ref 1 below.

H9N2 viruses are fairly regularly isolated from humans. The 1st reported human cases involved 2 children, in Hong Kong in 1999, who exhibited flu-like symptoms. Retrospectively, several H9N2 infections had occurred in mainland China during 1998. Subsequent human infections have been reported from Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Oman, now followed by India and Senegal.

Human H9N2 infections are generally mild and there has only been a single reported death due to the virus (a 57-year-old woman with underlying conditions, Sichuan, China, 2016; https://tinyurl.com/wj3cmqc). Human H9N2 cases are more often isolated during periods where other HPAI viruses are being surveyed for, such as H7N9 in China and H5N1 in Egypt and Bangladesh. As of June 2019, there have been a total of 59 laboratory-confirmed human H9N2 infections with over half of those being recorded since 2015 (see Table 2, Figure 2a in ref 1 below). The majority of those with confirmed infections were young children and the median age of infection was 4-years-old.

Recent evidence, summarised in ref 1 below, suggests LPAI H9N2 could potentially have a major role in the emergence of the next influenza pandemic, either directly as an H9N2 subtype virus, or through the donation of internal genes to a pandemic virus.

Due to the economic damage caused by enzootic H9N2, many countries including China, Israel, South Korea, Morocco, Pakistan, Egypt, Iran, and UAE have adopted vaccination at either a national or local level as a key approach for preventing H9N2 disease in poultry. The most common vaccines in use are traditional inactivated vaccines, similar to those used in human seasonal vaccines.

The human case in Senegal, a country in which hitherto H9N2 in poultry has not been reported, is an important development and further information on the epidemiological situation of the case, specifically about outbreaks in poultry in the region, would be highly appreciated.
