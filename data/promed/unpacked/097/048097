According to local media, a 14 year old has died of plague in Tsetserleg
County of Mongolia's Hovsgol Province. On 2 Aug 2007, the child went for
treatment at the county hospital due to fever and died that night. Sources
say that the deceased contracted plague through contact with a dog on 31
Jul 2007.
The Hovsgol Province Infection Prevention and Control Center sent a work
team to the area. The area has been closed and 27 individuals with primary
contact and 52 with secondary contact have been isolated for observation.
Up to now none has developed fever.
Mongolia is a high plague incidence region and plague has occurred in
almost all provinces. To prevent plague, the Mongolian Government has
issued prohibitions on marmot hunting. But illicit hunting incidents still
occur despite repeated prohibitions.

[The clinical manifestations of plague in the adolescent are not stated,
especially if pneumonic plague was present. It is also not clear what
relationship the dog had in the transmission of _Yersinia pestis_ in this case.
An American Veterinary Medical Association reference
(<http://www.avma.org/reference/zoonosis/znbuboni.asp>), with the citation
numbers changed to begin at 1, states:
"Generally, the canine family is believed to be more resistant to plague
than the feline family and if they develop the disease at all, the disease
usually is subclinical, that is, not easily recognizable. Wild carnivores
in the dog family, such as coyotes and foxes, can develop blood titers
against _Y. pestis_ (1,2) Experimentally, dogs inoculated with _Y. pestis_
develop bacteremia and have had _Y. pestis_ isolated for 10 days from the
oropharynx (1). Subclinically and clinically affected dogs can develop
antibodies against _Y. pestis_ (1), and people have contracted plague after
skinning infected coyotes and foxes (1,3).

Plague is endemic in Mongolia. Marmots such as the Tarvaga, the Tarbagan or
Mongolian Marmot _Marmota sibirica_, a large rodent related to the American
woodchuck (_M. monax_), are thought to be significant zoonotic reservoirs
for _Y. pestis_ in Eastern Asia. The name marmot
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot>) comes from French marmotte, from
Latin mures monti "mountain mouse."

province of Hovsgol is in the north-central part of the country. - Mod.LL]
