INFECTIOUS DISEASE LONG-TERM TRENDS: REQUEST FOR INFO
=====================================================
I am a research assistant for Anne Platt, a researcher at Worldwatch
Institute, who is currently working on a paper on infectious diseases. She
is looking for data on long-time trends in incidence and mortality of the
main diseases internationally and nationally, (TB, diarrhoea, respiratory
diseases, cholera, malaria, etc.) especially in relation to immunisation
developments. Finding time series data back to the 50's on a global or
regional basis has proven to be difficult. Any information you might have
on such statistics would be greatly appreciated.
There might be researchers out there who have "played" with the
WHO or other data to produce such numbers, hence this request on the
ProMED list.
If you have any questions about this request, do not hesitate to contact me
by telephone: (202) 452)1992 x.530, fax: (202) 297)7365, or e-mail:
worldwatch@worldwatch.org.
Thank you for your time and attention to this request. I am looking forward
to hearing from you soon,
Sincerely,
--
