Kakapo vet contracts disease
-----------------------------
A Palmerston North vet, who handled the 3 kakapo that died in Fiordland,
has now come down with the disease that killed them. This is proof of just
how virulent the bug is. [Concerning the transmission of this bacterium,
_Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae_, to humans, the infection is a well-known
zoonosis, and, this transmission does not necessary reflect virulence in
humans. - Mod.LL] The vet is on antibiotics like the surviving birds on
Chalky Island. Every possible precaution is being taken to prevent more
cases of the parrot disease.
"It started off as a small scratch. Within 48 hours, it became very red and
swollen, but, now [that] I've had my antibiotics, it's come back to normal
very quickly," says the affected man.
Meanwhile, more hardware arrived in Fiordland, on Fri 16 Jul 2004, to
further the treatment of the sick birds. Every effort is being made,
because, with only 83 kakapo in existence, they are some of the rarest
birds in the world.
More birds to be treated were captured on 16 Jul 2004, and Department of
Conservation staff hope the disease doesn't follow the pattern it has in
other species.
"You get a few [that] die off at the beginning, and then you get a few
random ones [that] die off in the next 2 to 3 weeks, and that's what we're
trying to protect these birds against," says Kate McInnes of DoC.

[The human zoonosis caused by _E. rhusiopathiae_ is called erysipeloid.
Erysipeloid, usually, is an acute, self-limited infection of the skin that
resolves without consequences (also known as erysipeloid of Rosenbach).
Erysipeloid most commonly affects the hands, mainly the webs of the
fingers. However, any exposed area of the body may be affected.
Lesions consist of well-demarcated, bright red-to-purple plaques with a
smooth shiny surface. Lesions are warm and tender. They leave a brownish
discoloration on the skin when resolving. Sometimes vesicles may be
present. Fever, malaise, and other constitutional symptoms may or may not
be present.
Rarely, individuals present with a systemic form, in which the skin is not
generally involved, which may present as a primary bacteremia,
endocarditis, or, septic arthritis, among other manifestations. It can be
treated with penicillin, or erythromycin, but is resistant to vancomycin.
For non-vets, I have provided a bit more information on this very rare
species that I first learned about from Douglas Adams' (the author of The
Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy and The Restaurant at the End of the
Universe) book, Last Chance to See, a nonfiction book about nearly extinct
species.
The kakapo's scientific name, _Strigops habroptilus_, means "owl-like',
referring to its nocturnal nature, unusual soft plumage, and facial disc of
bristle-like feathers. Its Maori name, "kakapo", means "night parrot". The
kakapo is the world's heaviest and only flightless parrot. They are up to
60 cm long and weigh up to 8 lbs. It has a virtually keel-less sternum
which makes it incapable of flying in the true sense. It can only
"parachute" from trees, using its wings for balance and braking, and, is
nocturnal, solitary, and secretive. It lives mainly on the ground, but, can
climb trees.
The birds live in New Zealand, an island country that had virtually no
mammals living on it for millions of years. It was a place inhabited by
birds and reptiles. The only types of mammal were 2 species of bats. The
kakapo did not learn the defense mechanisms to combat or escape mammalian
predators. This made the parrot very vulnerable, when new animals were
introduced by man. - Mod.LL]
[Veterinarians are to be reminded that many diseases of animals may be
zoonotic, and, when breaks in the glove, or other accidents occur,
re-gloving, and assuring that other precautions are taken, is essential. -
Mod. TG]
