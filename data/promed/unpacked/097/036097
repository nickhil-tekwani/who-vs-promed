PLOS [Public Library of Science] would like to introduce its new venue for the rapid publication of research in all aspects of infectious disease outbreaks, PLOS Currents: Outbreaks: http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/.

PLOS Currents: Outbreaks follows on the steps of PLOS Currents: Influenza, which launched in 2009 as a publication channel that would meet the need for swift publication of research during the influenza pandemic. We have now expanded the scope of this publication to cover all infectious disease outbreaks with impact or potential impact on human health.

PLOS Currents: Outbreaks considers research in all aspects of infectious disease outbreaks and particularly encourages submissions that report ongoing and first-cut analysis of emerging outbreaks. Work published by PLOS Current: Outbreaks undergoes formal peer-review, either by members of its Reviewer Board or by external reviewers. PLOS Currents: Outbreaks aims for a swift peer review turnaround in order to provide a channel for the publication of breaking research when it is most needed.

As an Open Access publication channel, PLOS Currents: Outbreaks makes research data immediately available to all upon publication, facilitating the prompt and efficient communication of data that is vital during an ongoing outbreak. Articles published at PLOS Currents: Outbreaks are publicly archived at PubMed Central and indexed in PubMed and SCOPUS.

You can read more about the goals, scope and mission of PLOS Currents: Outbreaks in the introduction from its Editors "PLOS Currents: Outbreaks -- For findings that the world just can't wait to see":
http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/plos-currents-outbreaks-for-findings-that-the-world-just-cant-wait-to-see/.

If you have any questions about PLOS Currents: Outbreaks or if you are interested in submitting work to PLOS Currents: Outbreaks or in supporting this initiative, please contact us on <currents@plos.org>.

[We believe this newest member of the PLOS family will be of interest to ProMED-mail members. This looks like a good venue to rapidly publish analysis and research based on the kinds of early outbreak reports often disseminated through ProMED -- we've been assured that reporting an outbreak on ProMED won't interfere with publication in PLOS Currents: Outbreaks. - Mod.LM]
