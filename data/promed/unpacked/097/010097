Abstract
--------
Background: Stalled progress in controlling _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria highlights the need for an effective and deployable vaccine. RTS,S/AS01, the most effective malaria vaccine candidate to date, demonstrated 55.8% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 51-60) efficacy over 12 months in African children.

Methods: We conducted a double-blind, randomised, controlled trial of a low-dose circumsporozoite protein-based vaccine, R21, with 2 different doses of adjuvant, Matrix-M(TM) (MM), in children aged 5-17 months in Nanoro, Burkina Faso, a highly seasonal malaria transmission setting. Three vaccinations were administered at 4-week intervals prior to the malaria season with a 4th dose one year later. Vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy were evaluated over one year.

Findings: 450 children were randomised to receive the R21/MM vaccine or a control rabies vaccine. R21/MM had a 43 favourable safety profile and was well-tolerated. At 6 months, 43 of 146 (29.5%) who received R21/MM with low-dose adjuvant, 38 of 146 (26%) who received R21/MM with high-dose adjuvant, and 105 of 147 (71.4%) who received the rabies vaccine developed clinical malaria. Vaccine efficacy (VE) was 74% (95% CI, 63-82) and 77% (95% CI, 67-84) in the low- and high-dose adjuvant groups, respectively. At one year, VE remained high at 77% (95% CI, 67-84) in the high-dose adjuvant group. Participants vaccinated with R21/MM showed high titres of malaria-specific anti-NANP antibodies 28 days after the 3rd vaccination, which were almost doubled with the higher adjuvant dose. Titres waned but were boosted to levels similar to peak titres following the primary series of vaccinations after a 4th dose administered one year later.

Interpretation: R21/MM appears safe and very immunogenic in African children, and demonstrates promising high-level efficacy.

[The randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial showed 77% vaccine efficacy in the high-dose adjuvant group after one year measured by the number of children developing malaria after immunization compared with those receiving rabies vaccination. The vaccine is a protein vaccine based on the circumsporozoite protein, CSP, that is also the malaria antigen included in the 1st approved malaria vaccine, the RTS,S/AS01 (Mosquirix(TM), GlaxoSmithKline). The results will without doubt be followed by larger trials. Even though the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine has a protection of approximately 55% against malaria over 12 months, its effect on mortality from malaria has never been proven. Therefore, for the new R21/MM vaccine mortality from malaria should be an endpoint in future studies.

It is important for comparison that properly used insecticide-treated nets have the same protective efficacy as the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine and properly used chemoprophylaxis in travellers shows more than 90% protection. - Mod.EP]
