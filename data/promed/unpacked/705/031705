The Government [of Zambia] has imposed a ban on the movement of cattle and other clove-hoofed animals in and out of Mbala and Mpulungu districts because of an outbreak of a disease suspected to be foot and mouth disease.

Northern Province Livestock and Fisheries officer Joseph Chiti said there is need to contain the disease that has broken out in the 2 districts. "There is a suspension of the movement of cattle in Mbala and Mpulungu districts because of the disease," he said.

[The current (suspected) outbreak is located in the Northern Province of Zambia, bordering Tanzania and the Tanganyika Lake. Confirmation (or otherwise) and information on the FMDV serotype involved would be appreciated.

The previous FMD outbreak in Zambia, affecting cattle, occurred in January 2015 in the other far end of the country, namely the Western province, bordering Angola. It was caused by FMDV serotype SAT-3 and remained, reportedly, solitary. This outbreak was controlled by sanitary measures, primarily animal movement control, and by ring vaccination carried out around the affected areas of Shangombo, Kalabo and Sikongo districts (about 110 000 cattle vaccinated). Its source was attributed to "contact with wild species".
