I'm not sure if this is the experience of other Veterinarians in other
countries but since graduating 10 years ago (and most of my colleagues whom
I have kept in contact with) have never seen a clinical case of distemper. I
have seen it while working in Northern England though.
Are there any comparisons of Paget's disease incidence between countries
with differing prevalence of distemper?
Distemper is definitely a disease of declining incidence in this country
[Australia] and has been for 20 years would we expect (if the hypothesis is
correct) that we should be seeing a decline of Paget's as well and is this
the case?
