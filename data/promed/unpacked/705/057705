[The Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme (GREP) had a remarkable
progress, limiting this List A disease to a single ill-defined focus in
southern Somalia, which is currently the only ecosystem in the world where
rinderpest is suspected to still exist. In October 2001, 2 cases were
recorded in African buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) in adjacent north-eastern
Kenya; in its annual report to the OIE, Kenya indicated that 250 000 heads
of cattle were vaccinated during 2001. If rinderpest has now indeed
infected domestic Kenyan cattle -- this is alarming news. - Mod.AS]
