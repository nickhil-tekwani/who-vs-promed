Health authorities in Thailand are racing to contain a measles outbreak in the country's southern provinces, where 14 deaths and more than 1500 cases have been reported since September [2018]. Officials blame the comeback of the disease on low vaccination rates in the south caused by misconceptions among the Muslim population about the nature of the vaccine.

Islam prohibits the consumption of pork, and vaccine makers sometimes use gelatin derived from pork products as a stabilizing agent. However, health official Vicharn Pawan said Thailand imports measles vaccine products that do not contain porcine gelatin.

The recent cases in Buddhist-dominated Thailand's Muslim-majority southern provinces represent half the total for the whole country since the beginning of the year [2018].

Measles cases nationwide have increased in recent years, Thailand's Health Ministry said. Last year [2017], nearly 3000 cases -- with no deaths -- were reported, compared to just over 1000 in 2012. According to the UN's World Health Organization, this year [2018] Japan and Brazil have also reported measles outbreaks, while Europe experienced a surge in 2017 with more than 20 000 cases and 35 deaths. Increasingly, there is a lot of misunderstanding about vaccinations that spread around Muslim communities here. Some said it is against their religion to receive vaccine shots, while others think it's not safe," said Anchanee Heemmina, a rights activist who lives in an affected area in the south.

The Indonesian Ulema Council, the religious body governing the world's largest Muslim population, had to deal with the same problem earlier this year [2018] when some local Muslim groups declared their opposition to the vaccine. It ruled that Muslims were allowed to use such vaccines out of necessity until other options were available. Its statement came after a measles outbreak in Indonesia's eastern province of Papua was believed responsible for the deaths of as many as 100 children. The Indonesian controversy may be responsible for the concerns among Muslims in Thailand and other countries.

According to the Thai Health Ministry's Prevention and Control office, the misunderstandings about vaccinations have resulted in some areas in which only 60 per cent of the population receives immunizations.

[The Muslim community is expressing their objection to the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine because of the mistaken idea that gelatin derived from pork products is being used as a stabilizing agent. This is not correct but, nonetheless, Muslims are avoiding protective vaccine even when the Council ruled in Indonesia it is permitted for now.

Thailand's Department of Health Service Support "has instructed the Primary Health Care Division, the Institute for Health Service System Innovation Development of Yala and the Office of Health Service Support Region 12 to implement measures to prevent the spread of measles in Yala, Pattani, Narathiwat, and Songkhla provinces", where the outbreak is occurring.

In September 2018, the Thailand Ministry of Public Health's epidemiology bureau reported 2149 measles cases, to which officials responded by accelerating the measles vaccination programme. "The measles virus has continued to spread, especially in the areas where fewer children were vaccinated," said Dr Songkran Maichum.

Dr Maichum said that there have been 341 people infected with measles from [1 Sep-9 Oct 2018] and that the main reasons for the fatalities were that patients had not been brought to a hospital early enough, and not been vaccinated at an early age. Most of the measles cases in Thailand were reported in Prachuap Khiri Khan, Samut Sakhon, Chiang Mai, and Amnat Charoen provinces.

Jerusalem remains Israel's measles hotspot with 838 confirmed cases during 2018. The Health Ministry of the State of Israel announced on 6 Nov 2018, that 735 measles cases [had been] confirmed during the month of October [2018]. The total number of measles cases confirmed by the Health Ministry for 2018 is 1401; Jerusalem has reported 838 measles cases during 2018.

During the 6 Nov 2018 meeting, Mrs Ilana Cohen, chairperson of the Israel Nurses Association, and Mr Avi Nissankorn, the Histadrut chairman, decided that "all nurses in all health bureaus and family healthcare centers will continue to vaccinate against measles, including all necessary activities to diagnose and prevent the spread of the disease." Moreover, deputy health minister Rabbi Yaakov Litzman added "that the ministry has allocated all of the financial resources needed to stop the disease from spreading further."

Specifically, the Ministry of Health decided on the following measures:
- To extend the vaccination campaign for the prevention of measles in Jerusalem which includes keeping Tipat Halav family care centers open in the evenings as well.
- The campaign is coordinated with the HMOs [health maintenance organisations] and municipal bodies. So far, the percentage of vaccination in unvaccinated "pockets" has risen from 55 per cent to more than 80 per cent.
- A mobile unit designated for the vaccination of communities. The mobile unit patrols the target neighborhoods in order to vaccinate on site.
- Coordinating with relevant elements within the communities with relatively low vaccination coverage rates.
- Hiring new nurses and adding new nurse positions in the Jerusalem district and helping nurses with additional manpower and male/female healthcare students.
- Restricting unvaccinated visitors' from entering sensitive departments in hospitals, such as the ward for premature babies, intensive care, oncology, and hematology-oncology.
- Considering the issue of restricting entry to schools to unvaccinated individuals who could put the public at risk.
- Because of the limited efficiency of the vaccine at an early age, and the necessity to repeat the vaccination at 12 months of age, it was decided to keep the age of the first vaccination as is, except in specific outbreak centers, which will be under the sole discretion of the district doctor of the Ministry of Health.

In the USA, measles outbreaks have been reported in Brooklyn and Rockland county NY. New York's health department said the initial measles cases reported in New York were acquired by children on a recent visit to Israel. As of 6 Oct 2018, 142 individual cases of measles have been confirmed [in the USA] in 25 states and the District of Columbia. The majority of people who got measles during 2018 were unvaccinated, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

http://efectococuyo.com/salud/seis-muertos-y-1-088-casos-ha-dejado-epidemia-de-sarampion-en-hospital-j-m-de-los-rios/


Measles arrived at the JM de los Rios children's hospital [in Caracas] less than a year ago but its consequences have been devastating. From the 1st case that arrived at the pediatric center in December 2017 until October 2018, the epidemiological records indicate 6 deaths and more than 1000 infections.

The last child to die of the vaccine-preventable disease was a 2 year old boy, who died on 7 Jul 2018 in Miranda state.

Internal sources of the hospital confirmed to Efecto Cocuyo that the last case of measles entered the JM de los Ríos on 4 Oct 2018. Since then, no new [cases have] been recorded. They also said that the National Institute of Hygiene Rafael Rangel, the body in charge of making laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, has been delayed in delivering the results, so that most cases are diagnosed on the basis of patients' clinical features (symptoms and signs).

However, doctors do not rule out the possibility that the total of 1088 cases will continue to increase over the next months. The figure is alarming, especially when compared with the numbers revealed by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/OPS) in its latest epidemiological bulletin, dated 24 Oct 2018.

From 1 Jan to 23 Oct 2018, the regional body processed 5525 cases of measles throughout the country and 75 deaths, according to the regional body data. That is to say, the deaths of children in JM de los Ríos represent 8 per cent of the total deaths due to measles. In addition, the hospital accumulated more than 19 per cent of the cases registered in the country during 2018.

PAHO specifies that of the total of 73 deaths, 37 occurred in Delta Amacuro, 27 in Amazonas, 6 in Miranda, and 3 in the Capital District. However, civil associations with presence in the 1st 2 entities have warned that the death figures are higher.

The National Institute of Health of Colombia reported that 158 cases of measles have been confirmed throughout the country so far in 2018. The increase is dramatic compared with the 1st quarter of the year, when the 1st case of imported measles was registered, a situation that has been driven by the immigration of Venezuelans to Colombia, according to the country's health authorities.

Of the 4863 cases reported until 2 Nov 2018, 4327 were discarded, the INS of Colombia reported. In 2014, this country had been declared a territory free of autochthonous measles.

The dramatic increase in cases of measles in Colombia has occurred since March 2018 when the 1st case was registered, in Medellin [Antioquia], in a 14 month old child from Caracas, Venezuela. Since then the cases of "imported" measles -- that is, people from other countries that carry the disease to Colombia -- have increased markedly. This is due to the migratory flow of Venezuelans in Colombia, which by 30 Oct 2018 had reached almost 800 000 citizens, according to Migracion Colombia.

"They are all from this year [2018]. They started in March, it was the 1st case we have," Diego Garcia Londono, national coordinator of the Vaccination Program of the Ministry of Health of Colombia, told CNN en Español. "We did not have cases reported last year [2017]. The 1st cases that were presented from the country were cases imported into the Venezuelan population that came from that country," said Garcia Londono. "There have been some cases associated with these and right now in Cartagena we already have a circulation of the virus ... with cases already in the Colombian population."

Figures from the Ministry of Health show that of the 158 cases of measles, 29 per cent correspond to imported cases; 58 per cent are related to these imports, and 13 per cent are from an unknown source. So far, says Garcia Londono, Colombia has not presented autochthonous cases of measles or rubella, another of the diseases that has increased in the country in recent months.

Places like Cartagena (65), Norte de Santander (26), and Barranquilla (14) are some of the most affected by the outbreak, says the Ministry. They are all from this year [2018]. Cartagena is one of the largest health care centers for health authorities, with 30 cases in children under 1 year of age, according to Garcia Londono. In this city the outbreak of measles began in mid-July [2018], according to the Ministry of Health.

Although measles cases have increased dramatically since March 2018, Colombia's figures are minimal compared to other countries such as Brazil and Venezuela, a country that reestablished "the endemic transmission of the virus," according to PAHO. As of 23 Oct 2018, 5525 cases of measles had been reported in Venezuela, including 73 deaths; in Brazil, 2192 cases, including 12 deaths; United States, 142; and Ecuador, 19 cases, among others. In general, up to that date, 8991 confirmed cases of measles, including 85 deaths, have been recorded in 11 countries in the Americas, according to PAHO.

But Colombia's authorities say 95 per cent of the year-old population is vaccinated against measles, and said the country bought 250 000 additional doses to vaccinate minors in the highest-risk regions such as border areas, where there is a high flow of Venezuelans. "Our population is vaccinated, adequately protected with the vaccination campaigns we have done," said the director of vaccination of the Ministry of Health of Colombia.

Over the past 2 weeks, 6 cases of measles have been identified in Spartanburg county, according to a statement from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control [DHEC]. The 1st case was reported on 30 Oct 2018, with 2 more cases reported on 2 Nov 2018. On [Thu 8 Nov 2018], DHEC reported 3 more measles cases in the county. The measles virus is highly contagious and spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

DHEC has notified healthcare providers to be on alert for patients with signs or symptoms of measles. DHEC is also notifying people who may have been exposed to measles in specific settings. People who had measles visited local urgent care facilities while they were infected.

The release said the patient is recovering at home, and was immediately isolated at the health center to "mitigate exposure". This is an unusual circumstance where we are trying to be as safe as possible," infectious disease doctor Catherine Yu said. "We know when this exposure was."

The Lowell Community Health Center said they communicated with the Lowell Health Department and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to try and identify people who might have been exposed.

One of the largest outbreaks of measles in New York state in modern times is getting worse in Rockland county, and new rules are being implemented for schools and students in the affected areas. Another 9 schools are now under a vaccination order implemented by the county Health Department, bringing the total to 34.

What that means is that all schools in the Village of New Square and any other in the county with less than 80 per cent of their students vaccinated will be required to keep those students home until 3 weeks have passed without a new measles case. The previous threshold was 70 per cent of students, so a greater number of schools are now affected.

At last count, there were 55 cases of measles in Rockland county, along with 9 more suspected cases that are being investigated by the Health Department.

The outbreak is thought to have started with a tourist from Europe.

https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/charedi-leaders-in-uk-urge-families-to-get-the-jab-amid-measles-outbreak/


Charedi [Orthodox Jewish] leaders in Stamford Hill [London Borough of Hackney] have urged religious Jews to get immunised against measles and for them not to send any of their children to school if one family member has it, after an outbreak in Israel found its way to Hackney. Local health authority practitioners have been producing literature in Yiddish and Hebrew encouraging those not already inoculated to get a jab, amidst warnings from rabbis that those opposed to it are risking the lives of others. It comes amid warning from nurses that families are still sending their other children to school even if a sibling has measles, instead urging all family members to get vaccinated or seek medical advice until they return to the classroom.

"People have to have responsibility to themselves and others," said Rabbi Avroham Pinter, the principal of Yesodeh HaTorah Senior Girls' School in Stamford Hill, who was responding after an 18 month old girl died from measles in Israel last week [week of 29 Oct 2018]. "There are some people who are opposed, but they must be mindful of the Halachic [Jewish religious laws ] responsibility [to themselves and others] and remember that measles can be life-threatening for the vulnerable, such as the very young or very old."

Pinter said he had written to all parents and added that the latest measles cases in Hackney were "only those with a connection with Israel," where an outbreak that began earlier this year [2018] has now reached more than 1000 cases. It is understood the outbreak has spread to "all" large Charedi communities around the world.

In London, the campaign to get Orthodox Jews inoculated was being led by Public Health England, with the London branch of emergency medical services charity Hatzola also taking out adverts in local newspapers. A Hatzola spokeswoman said the charity was not urging religious Jews to get inoculated against their will, but that the advert was "an awareness notice... warning of the severity of complications that can arise for those infected by measles."

[The measles outbreaks occurring throughout the world are entirely preventable. The MMR vaccine is effective and safe. There should be a requirement for a child to be vaccinated to enter school, with the exception of children with medical issues. The emotional cost to a family when a child is seriously ill cannot be measured, but the economic cost can be evaluated. A study was recently published that describes the epidemiology and public health burden in terms of resources and cost of the 2013 measles outbreak in New York City (USA). (Schwartz JL. Costs, consequences, and policy responses of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks. JAMA Pediatr. 2018; 172(9): 805-7. doi:10.1001/jamapediatrics.2018.2238; https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2688776). Excerpts follow:

"Importance: Internationally imported cases of measles into the United States can lead to outbreaks requiring extensive and rapid control measures. Importation of measles from an unvaccinated adolescent in 2013 led to what has been the largest outbreak of measles in New York City, New York, since 1992.

"Objective: To describe the epidemiology and public health burden in terms of resources and cost of the 2013 measles outbreak in New York City.

"Results: Between [13 Mar 2013], and [9 Jun 2013], 58 persons in New York City with a median age of 3 years (range, 0-32 years) were identified as having measles. Among these individuals, 45 (78 per cent) were at least 12 months old and were unvaccinated owing to parental refusal or intentional delay ... In total, 3351 exposed contacts were identified. Total direct costs to the New York City DOHMH [Department of Health and Mental Hygiene] were USD 394 448, and a total of 10 054 hours were consumed responding to and controlling the outbreak.

"Conclusions and relevance: Vaccine refusals and delays appeared to have propagated a large outbreak following importation of measles into the United States. Prompt recognition of measles along with rapid implementation of airborne isolation of individuals suspected of measles infection in health care facilities and timely reporting to public health agencies may avoid large numbers of exposures. The response and containment of measles outbreaks are resource intensive."

It is clear that because of the speed and frequency of travel, measles is not a disease confined to any one country. All countries must maintain at least 90-95 per cent vaccine coverage, with some estimates of 100 per cent immunization, to stop outbreaks. - Mod.LK]
