Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - update 8, 4 Jul 2005
-----------------------------------------------
On 4 Jul 2005, 13 new polio cases were confirmed in Indonesia,
bringing the total number of cases to 79. The new cases are from the
provinces of Banten and West Java.

The recently confirmed cases in Sumatra and Central Java occurred
outside the area where an emergency "mop-up" campaign was held from
31 May to 2 Jun [2005], and again on 29 Jun [2005]. Sumatra and
Central Java will be included in the next phase of the large-scale
immunization campaigns, which will start from August [2005]. A large
outbreak response immunization targeting 78 000 children aged less
than 5 years was held from 26 Jun [2005] around the case in Central
Java.

Prior to this outbreak, following an importation, Indonesia has not
had a wild poliovirus case since 1995.

[The comforting news in the update above is that the newly confirmed
cases come from areas that are already known to have poliovirus
transmission and were outside of the area where emergency "mop-up"
campaigns (vaccination activities) were held. The discomforting news
is the spread in each of the newly infected areas. Thus far, spread
has been to geographically contiguous areas (although calling the
single case in Lampung on the island of Sumatra as in a
geographically contiguous area is a bit of a stretch, as Sumatra is a
separate island from Java, where the other cases are, but Lampung is
the 1st Province as one moves westward from Banten and Jakarta
Provinces on Java to Sumatra). - Mod.MPP]
