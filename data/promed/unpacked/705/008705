The outbreak of chikungunya in St. Paul, La Reunion, contained
--------------------------------------------------------------
The ARS [Agence Regional de Sante; Regional Health Agency] announced
that as of 21 Jul 2010, 136 indigenous [locally acquired] cases of
chikungunya [virus infection] have been identified including 103
confirmed and 33 probable [cases]. In March 2010, an indigenous
outbreak of chikungunya on Reunion Island has been demonstrated to be
mainly in the commune of Saint-Paul. A warning on the risk of
epidemics and an overview of recommendations (including biological
[laboratory] confirmation) were conducted with health care
professionals (biologists, emergency physicians, infectious disease
[specialists]...) and other public health personnel.

Epidemiological surveillance has been strengthened, particularly in
the various municipalities in which a spatio-temporal clustering was
confirmed. The aim of this strengthening is to take the actions by
the vector control services of the ARS as early as possible.

Initial analysis of the strains showed a very strong homogeneity
between the strains identified in August 2009 in
Saint-Gilles-les-Bains and the Plateau-Caillou [viruses] isolated in
March 2010 and also with those circulating in Madagascar since 2006.

The epidemic came from Madagascar
---------------------------------
These results are in favor of reintroduction of chikungunya [virus]
in 2010, from Madagascar to Reunion. The most probable hypothesis is
the initiation of a transmission cycle involving one or more
indigenous [local] people who returned viremic from Madagascar.

The occurrence of indigenous cases are continuing over time,
confirming a local and persistent viral transmission of the virus on
the island. Currently the austral winter and the arrival of weather
conditions, less conducive to vector activity, helps to reduce (but
not necessarily stop) the [virus] transmission. In addition, the
chikungunya virus has been circulating since the 2005-2006 epidemic
in Madagascar, and also in Southeast Asia. The risk of reintroduction
is ongoing, requiring constant vigilance.

The transmission of chikungunya virus having been greatly reduced
(transmission at a sporadic, low level), the next epidemiological
report will be released in late August 2010 unless there are major
changes.

[The cumulative 2010 chikungunya confirmed case count has increased
from 52 as of 5 May 2010 to 103 in this report, and the number of
suspected cases from 16 to 33. One hopes that the outbreak will slow
down with the arrival of cooler weather.
