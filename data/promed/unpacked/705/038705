Observed association between the HA1 mutation D222G in the 2009
pandemic influenza (H1N1) virus and severe clinical outcome, Norway 2009-2010

Summary
-------
Infection with the recently emerged pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009
virus causes mild disease in the vast majority of cases, but
sporadically also very severe disease. A specific mutation in the
viral haemagglutinin (D222G) was found with considerable frequency in
fatal and severe cases in Norway, but was virtually absent among
clinically mild cases. This difference was statistically significant
and our data are consistent with a possible causal relationship
between this mutation and the clinical outcome.

The 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic has been characterised by mild
and self-limiting disease in the overwhelming majority of cases.
However, severe and fatal cases, many of them with primary viral
pneumonia, have been occurring in age groups where such clinical
outcomes are very rarely seen in seasonal influenza (1,2). It is
important to better understand what viral and host-related factors
determine this dichotomy.

Genetic characterisation of clinical specimens
----------------------------------------------
As part of the intensified surveillance carried out during the
current influenza pandemic, the national reference laboratory for
human influenza at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health collected
a large number of respiratory specimens from verified and possible
cases of pandemic influenza. In the present study we analysed 61
respiratory specimens from severe and fatal cases that occurred
between July and December 2009, as well as from 205 cases with mild
clinical outcomes collected between May 2009 and January 2010.
Genetic characterisation was performed using conventional sequencing,
or with a pyrosequencing assay subsequently developed to detect the
particular mutations described below and which facilitated
investigation of a large number of specimens.

Here we report the occurrence of an amino acid substitution, aspartic
acid to glycine in position 222 (D222G) in the HA1 subunit of the
viral haemagglutinin, in clinical specimens from 11 out of 61 cases
analysed in Norway with severe outcome. Such mutants were not
observed in any of 205 mild cases investigated (data tabulated in the
original text), thus the frequency of this mutation was significantly
higher in severe (including fatal) cases (p less than 0.001, Fisher's
exact test, 2-sided) than in mild cases. D222G mutants were detected
throughout the sampling period, from the 1st recorded severe cases in
July [2009] until early December [2009]. The frequency of another
substitution in the same position, D222E, did not differ
significantly between mild and severe cases (p=0.772). Yet another
substitution, D222N, was observed in a very few cases (n=4), and at a
higher rate than expected among severe cases (3 of 4 cases, p=0.039).
The wild type 222D was, not surprisingly, significantly less frequent
in severe than in mild cases (p less than 0.001).

In several of the patients where D222G mutant viruses were found,
they coexisted with wildtype 222D viruses. Further analysis of this
phenomenon is ongoing. The cases infected with the D222G-mutated
virus were not epidemiologically related to each other, and the
mutated viruses do not cluster together in phylogenetic analysis
(data not shown).

Validity and limitations of the analysis
----------------------------------------
Cases with severe clinical outcomes were much more likely to be
included in our study for several reasons: they are more likely to
seek healthcare, they are more likely to be prioritised for
virological testing, and their specimens are more likely to be
forwarded to the national reference laboratory where they have a
higher chance of being selected for detailed analysis than viruses
from mild cases. Because of this, we chose to record the frequency of
a given genotype in each severity group and compare it with the
corresponding frequency in other severity groups. This approach is
not expected to have a selection bias.

Cases were classified as mild, severe non-fatal, and fatal based on
the patient information that was available to us. Some seemingly mild
cases may later have exacerbated to severe outcomes without our
knowledge, or the presented patient information may have been
incomplete, but we think these cases must be few. On the other hand,
all severe and fatal cases were confirmed as non-mild. Thus, the fact
remains that only cases confirmed as severe outcomes exhibited the
D222G mutation in our investigation.

The sampling period for the cases analysed spans from the initial
detections of the pandemic H1N1 virus in early May 2009 until early
January 2010. The 1st severe and fatal cases occurred in July [2009].
By the end of December [2009], the epidemic in Norway had largely
passed, and a large proportion of cases in our data set is from the
peak period in October and November [2009]. At all times an effort
was made to include a reasonable number of non-severe cases in our
analyses, and such cases were well represented throughout the
pandemic. The fractions of severe/fatal cases among all analysed
cases during the 2-month periods July/August [2009] (n=21),
September/October [2009] (n=84), and November/December [2009]
(n=149), were within the range of 23 percent to 26 percent. Severe
outcomes were not recorded among the few cases in May and June [2009]
(n=11) and in January (n=1). We thus do not see a trend over time in
the composition of severe versus mild cases in our dataset that could
lead to an artificial difference in the frequency of the D222G
substitution. Furthermore, the D222G substitution was represented
also among the earliest fatal and severe cases in July and August [2009].

Specimens from both the lower and upper respiratory tract were
analysed. Lower respiratory tract specimens were available from
severe/fatal cases only, and in some cases they were the only
materials available. However, in all cases where we had paired upper
and lower airway specimens (5 cases with 222D and 4 cases with 222G),
the wildtype-versus-D222G pattern was matching between the locations.
We have therefore no reason to believe that this difference in
proportion of lower airway specimens distorted the analysis.

Discussion
----------
Amino acid position 222 resides in the receptor binding site of the
HA protein and may possibly influence the binding specificity and
thus the cellular tropism of the virus. The corresponding difference
between 2 viruses from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic correlates
to a shift in receptor preference (3), which conceivably could make
the virus prone to infect a wider range of cells in the lower
respiratory tract (4,5). However, the effect of a mutation depends on
the molecular context and it is unclear whether the binding
properties are affected likewise in the present pandemic virus as
they were in the 1918 influenza virus.

Our observations are consistent with an epidemiological pattern where
the D222G substitution is absent or infrequent in circulating
viruses, with the mutation arising sporadically in single cases where
it may have contributed to severity of infection. This may aid in
filling some knowledge gaps identified in a recent preliminary review
of this and other mutations in the pandemic virus (6). The
correlation between presence of the D222G substitution and a severe
clinical outcome may reflect an increase in pathogenicity caused by
the mutation, possibly related to a change in cellular tropism
rendering the virus more pneumotropic. Conversely, it is possible
that the likelihood of such mutations arising is higher in patients
who fail to fight off the virus rapidly and have virus already
colonising the lower respiratory tract. These 2 possibilities are not
mutually exclusive. A large proportion of the fatal and severe cases
had underlying risk conditions. However, some of the D222G cases
manifested themselves as a rapid unexpected deterioration after a
period of mild symptoms in previously healthy subjects, and we
consider it likely that there is a causal relationship between the
occurrence of the D222G mutation in this virus and severe disease.

It should be borne in mind, however, that the majority of severe and
fatal cases investigated did not carry the D222G substitution and,
clearly, this mutation is not required for a severe outcome.

Conclusions
-----------
To our knowledge, this is the 1st identification of a change in the
pandemic virus that correlates with a severe clinical outcome.
However, whereas our data lend statistically significant support to
an association between the D222G mutation and severity, the number of
mild cases would need to be larger to determine whether mutant
viruses are indeed circulating at a very low frequency also in
non-severe cases. Provided that D222G mutant viruses are not
circulating, that is, that they are less transmissible, the immediate
public health impact of this finding is limited. However, it may have
implications for the management of severe cases where the virus, if
transmitted through massive exposure, may be more virulent than the
commonly circulating variant. Furthermore, it may serve as a reminder
that the generally very low virulence of the current pandemic virus
is not a fixed characteristic, and that there is no reason for
complacency in carrying out measures that limit infection with this
virus at individual and population level.

Further virological, clinical, and epidemiological investigations are
needed to ascertain the role of this and other mutations that may
alter the virulence and transmissibility of the pandemic influenza A
(H1N1) virus.

Alternatively, it is possible that the likelihood of such mutations

However, overall the majority of severe and fatal cases investigated
did not carry the D222G substitution and this mutation is not
uniquely associated with a severe outcome. Nevertheless this is an
important observation and it will be important to determine if the
D222G substitution is present in other populations. - Mod.CP]
