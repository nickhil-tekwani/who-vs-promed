Sleeping sickness hit Mayuge
----------------------------
A total of 12 people were diagnosed with sleeping
sickness at Mayuge Grade Three health centre last
month [November 2007], the LC5 vice-chairman,
Peter Tasibula, has said. He warned that
residents were prone to the disease because the
Farming in Tsetse Controlled Areas project
stopped operating in the area. Sleeping sickness
is a vector-borne parasitic disease. The
parasites are transmitted to humans by tsetse
flies which acquire the virus from human beings or animals harbouring it.

[Mayuge District is located in the Southeastern
part of Uganda, and was already several years ago
classified as in a "pre-endemic" state regarding
sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis) (see:
Berrang-Ford L et al. Spatial Analysis of
Sleeping Sickness, Southeastern Uganda,
1970Â­2003. Emerg Infect Dis 2006;12:813-20
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no05/05-1284.htm>).
The cases reported here are therefore not a
surprise, and just confirm that trypanosomiasis
continues to be a problem in this part of Uganda.
General information on African trypanosomiasis
can be found at the WHO website
(<http://www.who.int/topics/trypanosomiasis_african/en/>). - Mod.EP]

[Background on the strategy for human African
Trypanosomiasis control in the African region can
be found at
<http://www.who.int/trypanosomiasis_african/resources/afro_tryps_strategy.pdf>.
The most recent update on the epidemiologic
situation related to trypanosomiasis in Africa
can be found in the WHO Weekly Epidemiologic
Record (WER), 24 Feb 2006, 81: 71-80. This
review article gives data on the number of
reported cases by country for the period 1990
through 2004 for _Trypanosoma brucei gambiense_
(_T.b. gambiense_) cases and _Trypanosoma brucei
rhodesiense_ (_T.b. rhodesiense_) cases (see
tables 2 and 3 at
<http://www.who.int/wer/2006/wer8108.pdf>). This
document mentions that transmission of _T.b.
gambiense_ is occurring in the northwestern part
of Uganda, primarily in Adjumani, Arua, Moyo and
Yumbe, whereas the foci of _T.b. rhodesiense_ are
located in the southeastern part of Uganda,
primarily in 10 districts (Busia, Busiri, Iganga,
Jinja, Kamule, Kamuli, Mayuge, Mukono, Soroti and
Tororo). There are concerns that _T.b.
rhodesiense_ has been expanding northward as a
result of cattle movement during periods of civil
unrest. Presumably the above newswire is
referring to _T.b. rhodesiense_
activity. Information on the current situation
of trypanosomiasis in Uganda from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.
