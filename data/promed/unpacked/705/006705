Progress toward poliomyelitis eradication -- Nigeria, Jan 2003 -- Mar 2004
-----------------------------------------
Since the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis
(1), 3 World Health Organization (WHO) regions (Americas, Western Pacific,
and European) have been certified polio-free, and the number of countries
where polio is endemic has decreased from 125 in 1988 to 6 in 2003
(Afghanistan, Egypt, India, Niger, Nigeria, and Pakistan). In 2003,
Nigeria, the most populous country of the African continent (2003
population projected from 1991 census report: 125 million), reported 355
wild poliovirus (WPV) cases, accounting for 45 per cent of cases reported
globally and >80 per cent of cases reported from the African Region (AFR).
This report summarizes progress toward polio eradication in Nigeria during
Jan 2003 to Mar 2004. The findings indicate the urgent need to implement
high-quality supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in Nigeria to
interrupt ongoing WPV transmission.
Routine vaccination
-------------------
To date, routine coverage estimates vary considerably from state to state.
Because administrative data for 2003 are still being evaluated, national
estimates of coverage are not available.
Supplemental Immunisation Activities (SIAs)
-------------------------------------------
Since 1996, SIAs targeting children aged <5 years have been conducted
annually in Nigeria (2). National Immunization Days (NIDs)* were conducted
annually through 2002 (3). In February and March 2004, 2 NID rounds were
conducted, targeting all 37 states (36 states plus one Federal Capital
Territory [FCT]). All states except Kano and Zamfara took part in the
February round, and all except Kano took part in the March round.
In 2003, 9 rounds of Subnational Immunization Days (SNIDs)** were
conducted, targeting northern states where polio is endemic. The number of
participating states and target population varied in each SNID, with the
number of children vaccinated ranging from 3.6 to 15.0 million. 12 states
with endemic disease (Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina,
Kebbi, Niger, Sokoto, Yobe, and Zamfara) and FCT took part in at least 2
rounds of SNIDs during 2003. Reported coverage at the state level during
these SNIDs ranged from 56-100 per cent. In addition, during 2003, 4 rounds
of mop-up vaccination activities were conducted in Nasawara state and 2
rounds each in Benue and Kogi, sites that had been re-infected with WPV
after being polio-free for >12 months. Reported coverage in these states
during these mop-up activities ranged from 86 to 100 per cent.
National polio eradication programs analyze the oral polio vaccine (OPV)
vaccination status (routine and supplemental doses) of children aged <5
years, with nonpolio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) as a proxy for OPV
coverage in the general population. As the OPV coverage of population
increases, the percentage of nonpolio AFP cases with >3 doses of OPV also
should increase. During 2003, the proportion of nonpolio AFP cases in
children aged <5 years who had received >3 doses of OPV was <60 per cent in
12 of 13 states (median: 33 percent; range: 9 per cent--75 per cent) where
polio is endemic. The proportion of nonpolio AFP cases in children aged <5
years who had received >3 doses of OPV was <60 per cent in 5 of 8
re-infected states, but in only one of the 14 states without endemic disease.
Acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance
------------------------------------------
Surveillance for AFP, initiated in 1997, is conducted at 4035 reporting
sites in the 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Nigeria. AFP surveillance
quality is evaluated by 2 key indicators: 1) annual reporting rate (target:
nonpolio AFP rate of >1 case per 100 000 children aged <15 years) and 2)
completeness of stool specimen collection (target: 2 adequate specimens
from >80 per cent of all people with AFP). In 2003, Nigeria attained a
national nonpolio AFP rate of 5.5; all 37 states attained rates of >1.0.
The adequate stool specimen collection rate nationally for 2003 was 91 per
cent; all 37 states the target rate of >80 per cent. Surveillance
performance at the LGA level varied; 123 (16 per cent) of 774 LGAs were
below the target levels for one or both surveillance indicators.
When surveillance quality is high, previous genetic analyses of WPV from
all regions with endemic disease have indicated that nearly all isolates
are >99 per cent identical to some other previous isolate in the viral VP1
coding region. In 2003, about 17.5 per cent of the isolates in Nigeria
(type 1 [PV1], n = 43; type 3 [PV3], n = 19) were <98.5 per cent identical
to any other previous isolate, indicating that some of the closely related
polioviruses were not detected because of gaps in surveillance quality
(viruses missed in the chain of transmission for >1 year).
Stool samples collected from people with AFP in Nigeria are tested at 2
WHO-accredited national polio laboratories, one in Ibadan (Oyo state) and
one in Maiduguri (Borno state). In 2003, the Ibadan and Maiduguri
laboratories processed 6549 stool specimens. The proportion of specimens
with nonpolio enterovirus (NPEV) isolated is used as a combined indicator
of quality of specimen transport and sensitivity of laboratory processing;
a rate of >10 per cent is considered acceptable. The NPEV isolation rate
during 2003 was 11.9 per cent for Ibadan and 9.5 per cent for Maiduguri.
Median times for reporting primary isolation and intratypic differentiation
results were 17 days (75 per cent within 20 days) and 16 days (75 per cent
within 22 days), respectively.
Wild poliovirus (WPV) incidence
-------------------------------
During 2002--2003, the number of confirmed WPV in Nigeria increased from
202 to 355 [see table at above URL]. Of these, 192 were PV1, and 163 were
PV3. In 2003, a total of 23 of 37 states reported at least one WPV,
representing a wider area of circulation than in 2002, when 15 states
reported WPV [see figure at above URL link]. Of these 23 states, 13 are
considered to have endemic transmission, whereas 10 were re-infected after
being polio-free for >12 months. Early in 2004, PV1 was reported from
Anambra state, one of 14 southern states that had remained polio-free in 2003.
In 2003, the outbreaks in Nigeria centered in Kano. Of 89 WPV cases in
Kano, 57 (64 per cent) were associated with PV3 and 32 (36 per cent) with
PV1. Virus sequence data indicated that the PV3 virus radiated outward
along multiple independent chains of transmission. This outbreak started in
March. The PV1 outbreak started in May, at the onset of high transmission
season. A second peak of PV3 cases occurred in August, when numbers of PV1
and PV3 cases were equal. Of 355 polio cases reported in 2003, a total of
81 (23 per cent) occurred in children aged >3 years, of which 69 (85 per
cent) were either never or incompletely vaccinated.
Of the 18 genetic clusters (corresponding to groups of related chains of
transmission) observed in Nigeria in 2002 (14 PV1 and 4 PV3), 7 were not
observed in 2003 (6 PV1 and one PV3). However, the large outbreaks in 2003
have increased the genetic diversity of several clusters such that some
previous PV1 clusters have expanded into at least 4 new genetic clusters,
indicating intense transmission.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
After gains toward polio eradication during 1996-2002, Nigeria suffered a
resurgence of WPV transmission attributable to the suspension of
vaccination campaigns in fall 2003 in several northern states, particularly
Kano. This resurgence resulted in the reintroduction of WPV into previously
polio-free Nigerian states and exportation of WPV to 8 polio-free countries
in West and Central Africa (Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic,
Chad, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, and Togo).
The increased intensity of WPV transmission in the states with endemic
polio in northern Nigeria in 2003 occurred despite an increased number of
targeted SIAs. 7 of the 13 states with endemic disease were involved in 4
or more SNID rounds in 2003; all 13 states have continued to confirm WPV.
Continued WPV transmission with expansion of genetic diversity, the
occurrence of polio in older children, and OPV data from nonpolio AFP cases
demonstrate the failure to reach a substantial proportion of children
during the vaccination campaigns.
False rumors about OPV safety adversely affected SNIDs, with the greatest
impact in Kano, where 25 per cent of all Nigerian WPV cases occurred in
2003. Citing vaccine safety concerns, state authorities in Kano (which last
conducted a SNID in Apr 2003) decided in August 2003 to suspend all SIAs
(4). Statewide suspension of SIAs at different times during 2003-2004 also
occurred in Kaduna, Zamfara, and (to a limited extent) in Niger state. As a
result of these rumors, public health managers and frontline health care
workers found it increasingly difficult to improve microplanning, training,
and implementation of SIAs.
On 15 Jan 2004, the federal minister of health signed the Geneva
Declaration on Polio Eradication together with the ministers from the other
5 countries with endemic disease. To address OPV safety concerns, the
president of Nigeria established a safety verification committee, which
included religious and traditional leaders, state officials, and federal
government scientists. The committee undertook testing of OPV in India and
South Africa and, in March 2004, presented its report, which indicated that
OPV is safe. As a result, the northern states, except Kano, fully endorsed
their participation in SIAs, with the president of Nigeria personally
launching the campaign in Zamfara.
Nigeria and its polio partner agencies have endorsed a strategic plan that
proposes 6 SIA rounds in all states with endemic disease by December 2004.
The plan focuses on improving the quality of microplanning, vaccination
team selection, training, and social mobilization. In addition, a new
mechanism for rapidly disbursing funds to vaccinators is being planned for
2004. Restoring public confidence in the safety of OPV will be critical to
the success of SIAs.
In 2003, Nigeria maintained certification-quality AFP surveillance at the
national and state levels. Remaining gaps at the LGA level will be
addressed through greater scrutiny of the timeliness and completeness of
surveillance reports and prioritized supervision of low-performing LGAs.
The opportunity to achieve polio eradication globally has never been
greater. The government of Nigeria and its partners must ensure that every
child is administered OPV, so that Nigeria, the rest of Africa, and the
world can achieve polio eradication.
