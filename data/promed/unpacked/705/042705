[1] Ebola financial costs could be 3 billion euros [USD 3.6 billion] in 2015

The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has devastated lives in 3 of the continent's poorest countries [Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia]. The World Bank says the cost of the outbreak to Sub-Saharan Africa's economy could reach the equivalent of 3 billion euros [USD 3.6 billion] in 2015.

Daniel Richards, Senior Africa Analyst at Business Monitor, said: "The worst affected sector we believe is the mining sector. This was a sector that was expected to power growth in these 3 countries over the coming years with a massive ramp up in investment in iron ore exports. The combination of the Ebola crisis and a drop in global iron ore prices has meant that this sector has really been hit. Mines have closed in Sierra Leone. Two major mines have closed there. It's the restrictions on movement, markets being closed, borders being closed."

The World Bank has pledged USD 200 million to fight the crisis. The virus claimed more than 6300 lives during 2014 [latest WHO update, 7879 deaths. - Mod.LK].

In October 2014, the World Health Organisation [WHO] officially declared Nigeria Ebola-free. But many people are avoiding the region. "People don't want to travel to West Africa for meetings, for conferences, so while it is not a major catastrophe as it might have been had the virus spread in Nigeria, it has really hurt the region," explained Business Week's Daniel Richards. Meanwhile, the number of children whose parents succumbed to Ebola is growing.

[2] Ebola wrecks years of aid work in worst-hit countries
Date: Tues 30 Dec 2014

Ebola is wrecking years of health and education work in Sierra Leone and Liberia following their civil wars, forcing many charity groups to suspend operations or re-direct them to fighting the epidemic. More than a decade of peace and quickening economic growth had raised hopes that the nations could finally reduce their dependency on foreign aid and budgetary support; now Ebola has undermined those achievements, charity workers and officials say.

"The impact of Ebola will take us completely back to it being a basket case," said Rocco Falconer, CEO of educational charity Planting Promise in Sierra Leone. "The impact on some activities have been simply catastrophic." The 2 countries worst hit by Ebola have struggled to recover from the wars that raged through the 1990s until early in the 21st century, killing and maiming 10s of 1000s and devastating already poor infrastructure.

In Sierra Leone, aid made up 1/5th of economic output in 2010, according to officials, though this had been shrinking as growth accelerated thanks to a boom in the country's commodities exports. Britain and the European Union are the main donors, with funds directed to health, education and social assistance. But Planting Promise's experience typifies the problems of non-government organisations (NGOs) since Ebola hit West Africa. It had spent 6 years in Sierra Leone developing farms and using the profits to fund local schools. The project had just become self-financing for the 1st time when the outbreak was detected in March 2014. After that, things fell apart. Planting Promise was forced to withdraw its expatriate staff in June 2014, and the following month, it closed its 5 primary schools, where nearly 1000 pupils had studied. It has also shut down its food processing factory.

Though sales have dived, it continues to pay about 120 staff, eating into its reserves. This has forced the group to return "cap in hand" to donors to ask for more money, Falconer said. The highly contagious disease has brought normal activity to a near halt in the 2 countries. Governments have issued strict quarantine orders on communities, restricted people's movement and closed schools. They have also banned gatherings, communal work and markets.

Paul Saquee, the chairman of the council of chiefs in Sierra Leone's eastern Kono region, said disruption to the long-term agricultural development projects of one NGO would have knock-on effects. "It means the work they were doing before suffers, and next year we will have less food supply," he told Reuters.

In Liberia, the epidemic dashed President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's hopes of shifting the focus of aid to investment. "Now Ebola is here, and all of those efforts have been brought to a standstill. We could be starting from scratch again," said Jennah Scott, director of the Liberia Philanthropy Secretariat, a government agency. "That is very heartbreaking."

The World Bank and other donors have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in aid. But Scott is concerned that money will go mostly to United Nations agencies and large NGOs, rather than local organizations.

"We need to get more support to local NGOs, because they are the ones who stay in Liberia," said Scott, whose organization channels around USD 20 million in aid a year into Liberia.

The WaterAid organization, which works to improve access to safe water, hygiene and sanitation services in developing countries, had to suspend plans to drill 100 boreholes in Sierra Leone and provide services to 4 villages in Liberia... - more

[3] IMF focus on cutting debt over health spending worsened Ebola in Africa: study
Date: Tues 30 Dec 2014

http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/30/us-ebola-africa-imf-idUSKBN0K80VA20141230


The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was partially responsible for the scale of the Ebola crisis as its policies hampered healthcare spending in these post-conflict states, according to a new study [A Kentikelenis et al. The International Monetary Fund and the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet Global Health. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(14)70377-8].

Conditions on IMF loans to Guinea, Sierra Leona and Liberia over the past 2 decades prioritized debt repayments and building foreign exchange reserves over healthcare spending, said research by professors from 3 leading UK universities.

The study comes amid mounting criticism about the slow response to the world's worst outbreak of Ebola and increasing scrutiny on how organizations could have acted differently to prevent this. "Policies advocated by the IMF have contributed to under-funded, insufficiently staffed, and poorly prepared health systems in the countries with Ebola outbreaks," said Alexander Kentikelenis, a Cambridge University sociology professor and an author of the study published in the Lancet Global Health journal.

Heavily indebted to foreign lenders after emerging from conflicts, the 3 countries rely partially on loans to run government services, including health centers. As a condition for financing, the IMF imposes public sector reorganization on debtor countries and promotes privatization and decentralization of services.

"The IMF is working on mechanisms to allow us to move rapidly to provide more debt relief to these countries, which would free up more resources that could be used for health care spending," wrote Sanjeev Gupta, an official with the Washington-based financial institution.

The study did not say how many deaths could have been avoided had the IMF not imposed changes to health spending. Other countries in the region, including Nigeria and Senegal -- who also faced cases of Ebola -- had stronger healthcare systems, which were able to stop mass contagion of the epidemic, Kentikelenis said.

Gupta denied that IMF policies had caused a drop in spending on health services, saying healthcare funding increased 1.6 percent in Liberia as a percentage of GDP, 0.7 percent in Guinea and 0.2 percent in Sierra Leone between 2010 and 2013 [But how much of this was actually disbursed to the health sector? There have been reports of non-payment of salaries and deviation of funds. - Mod.JW].

He said mortality rates, child nutrition and sanitation had all improved in the 3 Ebola-hit nations in the past decade. Kentikelenis, who conducted the research with other academics from Cambridge University, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oxford University, said that bump in funding since 2010 came from factors beyond IMF controls, including "increased aid flows."

The IMF has pledged USD 430 million to fight Ebola in the 3 worst affected countries, the study said.

[Iraq: This brief report does not state whether or how the Ebola cases have been confirmed, and whether they are being treated at a hospital in Iraq. We await further news on confirmation of the etiology and the condition of the individuals, and information on their country of origin prior to entering Iraq. It is more likely that these Ebola "cases" are malaria relapses.

In an earlier report (http://www.iraqinews.com/features/concerns-spread-ebola-basra-department-health-confirms-casualties/) from 16 Oct 2014, an Iraqi worker in a foreign oil company in Basra informed IraqiNews.com that there are foreign employees who come from countries where the disease Ebola is spreading; they are currently working in the oil companies and may be infected by the disease.
