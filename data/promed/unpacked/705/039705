A dead crow discovered in Fresno is the 1st bird to test positive for
West Nile virus in Fresno county this year (2009), the Fresno County
Health Department said Friday [3 Apr 2009].

Fresno County joins Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego counties as
sites where the virus, which can be fatal to humans [and unvaccinated
horses. - Mod.TY], has been discovered in birds this year [2009].
