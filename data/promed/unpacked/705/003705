Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: illegal movement of animals; contact with infected animal(s) at grazing watering
Epidemiological comments: Infection was first detected during routine farm inspections at Weldene farm in Figtree areas of Matobo district [Matabeleland South]. Weldene farm, a self-contained commercial farm, had, 2 weeks earlier, received animals from an auction sale in Bulawayo city. Trace-back inspections of all properties that had sent animals to this sale were done and revealed infection at one of the source farms in the Bulawayo peri-urban area. Infection was also detected at two neighbouring properties, one of which is Mbokodo feedlot. Mbokodo feedlot also has an abattoir on the same property. Inspection of records revealed cattle originating from Mwenezi district [Masvingo province] in the infected zone that were meant for direct slaughter at Mbokodo abattoir and were illegally diverted into the feedlot and are suspected to have introduced infection into the herd. No other property that had sent cattle to the Bulawayo auction sale had infection. Trace-forward inspections of all properties that received cattle from the auction sale revealed infection at four different sites. All the four infected sites had moved animals out after the date they received cattle from the auction.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
