Ebola Fears Recede Following Preliminary Diagnosis of Typhoid Fever
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: Preliminary test reports carried out on blood samples from a
patient currently receiving treatment for a disease whose symptoms
resembled those of Ebola hemorrhagic fever have shown that the patient was
suffering from typhoid fever. The results, according to Kenyan Public
Health Minister Sam Ongeri confirmed that there was no outbreak of the
deadly disease at the Police Academy in Nyeri, Central Kenya, where a
female recruit died on Monday [actually Mon 2 Apr 2001 - Mod. The Minister
told parliament on Wednesday evening that reports from the Kenya Medical
Research Institute revealed that the second [presumptive hemorrhagic fever
victim had typhoid fever.
The Minister added that he was still awaiting final results and would issue
a further statement later. But he assured Kenyans that the country was not
dealing with a case of the deadly Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The minister
also stated that the deceased patient had a family history of bleeding, and
that one of her siblings had died from some bleeding 3 years ago. Ongeri
said she could therefore have been affected by either an inherited bleeding
disorder associated with malaria known as disseminated intravascular
cougulopathy, or hemorrhagic fever. He said that male patient, who is being
cared for at the Mathari Catholic Hospital, was responding well to treatment.
The government has meanwhile instructed that the body of first victim must
remain at the hospital where she died until results from specimens sent to
South Africa are received. Fears of an Ebola outbreak scared the country
at the beginning of the week when the woman died within hours of admission
to hospital. She had initially been treated for malaria at the Police
Academy clinic before being transferred to the mission hospital after her
condition deteriorated.

[A similar report was published in the East African Standard on Thu 12 Apr
2001 <http://www.eastandard.net/eahome/story120420010010.htm>. There seems
little in common between the 2 patients, other than that they attended the
same police training college. The basis for the diagnosis of typhoid fever
in the second case is unclear. The issue will remain unresolved until the
results of laboratory tests become available. - Mod.CP
