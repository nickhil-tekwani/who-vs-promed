Uttarakhand's health department is alarmed after the death of a girl
due to high fever and severe lung infection. Another girl has
reported similar symptoms.

The officials are suspecting the spread of the deadly hantavirus and
these to be the 1st cases of the disease in India. Authorities at
Mahant Indresh Hospital here said 2 girls, one from Dehradun and
another from Tehri, were admitted some days ago with very high fever
and severe infection in their lungs, both symptoms of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS).

The patients were later shifted to Himalayan Institute Hospital at
Jollygrant for better treatment after they complained of stomach
problems and difficulty in breathing. One of the girls later died,
and the other is still battling for her life.

Dr Ved Prakash, director of Mahant Indresh Hospital, told media
persons that symptoms in both the girls indicated hantavirus
infection, a deadly disease that spreads through rats and lizards and
could lead to bubonic plague [sic., see Mod. comment below]. Taking
note of the death, the health department sent a team of doctors to
Mahant Indresh Hospital and the Himalayan Institute Hospital on
Sunday [3 Aug 2008] to investigate and take blood samples from the
surviving patient.

"The blood samples would be sent to the National Institute of
Virology, Pune and the National Institute for Communicable Diseases
in New Delhi for confirmation. We can say whether the death was due
to HPS only after we get the reports," said Dr G.C. Baunthiyal, CMO, Dehradun.

Appealing to the public not to panic, health department officials
have asked them to refrain from coming in close contact with rodents
like rats and lizards [sic., see below] in their homes and work
places as a safety measure. Health Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank
stated that the department is keeping a close watch on the situation
and has directed chief medical officers in all districts to keep
track of any similar symptoms in their areas and notify the higher
authorities immediately.

According to doctors, HPS is a rare but serious and often deadly lung
infection caused by a type of virus called a hantavirus that is
carried by rodents like rats and lizards [sic.]. To date, there has
been no known case of the disease in India.

People get HPS when they breathe in dust contaminated with saliva,
urine, or droppings from infected rodents. No anti-virus drug is
effective against HPS, and there is no vaccine.

To prevent it one, should avoid contact with rodents and avoid
inhaling contaminated dust.

[The symptoms reported for these 2 cases are too general to suggest
agents that might be responsible for the illnesses. The hantaviruses
that cause HPS have never been found in South or Southeast Asia. The
hantaviruses found in these regions cause hemorrhagic fevers with
renal complications. That does not rule out the possibility that
HPS-causing hantaviruses are present in northern India, but it is
unlikely based on current information. It is likely that the health
authorities were misquoted by the reporter of this article. Lizards
are not rodents, and no hantaviruses have been associated with
lizards to date. Similarly, hantavirus infections do not turn into
bubonic plague. There are several possible etiological agents that
might be involved in these cases. ProMED requests further information
as the laboratory results become available. - Mod.TY]

[As Mod. TY states above, a symptom complex of fever and lower
respiratory infection is too non-specific to narrow down the possible
differential diagnosis of the etiology. In India, there was an
outbreak of pneumonic plague with 16 cases and 4 deaths attributable
to the disease in 2002 in Himachal Pradesh, a bordering state to
Uttarakhand (see prior ProMED mail postings referenced below). In
1994 there was a large multistate outbreak of plague, both bubonic
and pneumonic in India (Maharashtra {488 cases}, Gujarat {77 cases},
Karnataka {46 cases}, Uttar Pradesh {10 cases}, and Madhya Pradesh {4
cases) and from the federal district of New Delhi (68 cases) (see
reference below). Other possibilities would include bacterial
pneumonia or a primary viral pneumonia. It would be helpful if there
was information on the veterinary health situation in the areas where
these girls lived. It is also quite possible that these are simply 2
case reports of complicated lower respiratory infection without any
common denominators to suspect there is something more sinister to be
concerned about. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more
information from knowledgeable sources.

Uttarakhand (also known as Uttar Anchal) is located in the north of
India sharing a border with China to the north, with Nepal to the
east, Uttar Pradesh to the south, and Himachal Pradesh to the west. A
