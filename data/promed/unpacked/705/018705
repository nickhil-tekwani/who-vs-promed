Health experts yesterday [23 Oct 2012] in Abuja [the capital] expressed fears of possible outbreak of yellow fever in the country.

They said 30 years after the last yellow fever epidemic outbreak in the country, no nationwide vaccination had been conducted since, stating that over 101 million Nigerians are at risk of being infected with the disease.

The warning is coming amidst recent outbreak of yellow fever in 6 districts of Cameroon bordering Cross River State [but see moderator comments below], which places Nigeria at risk because it is the only country among 13 in West Africa yet to conduct mass vaccination.

Speaking at a stakeholders' meeting yesterday [23 Oct 2012] in Abuja on the Preparation for Mass Vaccination against yellow fever in high risk states in Nigeria, the Chairman, Expert Review Committee (ERC) on Polio Immunisation, Prof Oyewole Tomori, disclosed that about 377 local government areas in 25 states in the country had been marked out as high risk states [areas].

He warned, "We're a large population and if we don't conduct this mass vaccination, we cannot predict what will happen. We need to put the money where it is important. We don't want a situation where we cure, so let's put the money on prevention."

Tomori also bemoaned Nigeria's reliance on other countries in the world for its vaccine needs. According to him, "There's no reason why Nigeria should be depending on other countries for its vaccine. We had a vaccine-manufacturing firm in Yaba, Lagos in 1994, which has gone under. We need to resuscitate it. Is it not lamentable that a country like Senegal is also one of the countries producing vaccine for us?"

Mathematical models used in assessing Nigeria's situation suggest an urban area like Lagos could see up to 4.5 million cases along with 128 000 deaths, requiring millions of vaccine doses, which take considerable time to produce.

In his presentation, the chief consultant epidemiologist, Federal Ministry of Health, Dr Akin Oyemakinde, said that an outbreak of yellow fever at this level would have enormous consequence on the economy and on the health system. He added that there would be potential of Nigeria exporting yellow fever to other countries, if there's an outbreak. According to him, Nigeria's last vaccination against yellow fever was in 1995 after an outbreak that lasted 8 years resulted in 20 000 cases and killed more than 5000 people. He noted, "Millions currently have no protection against yellow fever virus, leaving herd immunity low around the country."

The mass vaccination programme is planned to start in 2013 and take up to 5 years to complete because of the country's size. The World Health Organisation has called it "one of the biggest campaigns ever" for which Nigeria has to be ready.

[The statement that, "The warning came amidst a recent outbreak of yellow fever in 6 districts of Cameroon bordering Cross River state..." is not correct because the only yellow fever (YF) cases in Cameroon known to ProMED-mail and WHO were those in the North, miles away from Cross River state. - Mod.JW

However, YF cases in Cameroon did occur in the Northern Region bordering the Nigerian states of Borno, Adamawa, and Taraba, so the warning about the risk of a massive YF outbreak in the country is real. One hopes that the warnings by Profs. Babalobi and Tomori will be heeded. Prevention through vaccination is more humane and cost effective than dealing with an ongoing YF outbreak.
