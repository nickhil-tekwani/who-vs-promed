Report date: 19 Oct 2018
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2015
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: prion (classical C-type BSE)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Auchindoir and Kearn, Scotland
Date of start of the outbreak: 2 Oct 2018
Outbreak status: resolved on 18 Oct 2018
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 1 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: isolated case of classical bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been confirmed in a 5-year-old indigenous cow in Aberdeenshire. The animal died on farm and the case was detected during routine surveillance of fallen stock cattle. The animal was not presented for slaughter and did not enter the food chain. There is no threat to food safety or human health. 4 other bovines from the herd will be destroyed as a precaution.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 100 / 100 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: [no information provided]
Epidemiological comments: a full epidemiological investigation is being carried out to identify evidence of routes of infection. This will be made available on https://www.gov.uk in due course. UK remains vigilant to the threat posed by BSE and the following key controls that protect public and animal health remain in force:
- the ban on feeding animal protein to farmed animals, which prevents the spread of BSE to animals through feed;
- removing specified risk material (SRM) at slaughter to protect consumers; and
- surveillance to monitor the level of BSE over time and thereby check on the continued effectiveness of BSE controls.

Control measures
Measures applied: traceability, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Animal & Plant Health Agency laboratory Weybridge (OIE reference laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Western blot / 18 Oct 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This current event of BSE in UK was covered in ProMED-mail posting 20181019.6099295.

"Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a fatal neurological disease of adult cattle that was first recognised in Great Britain (GB) and that has been identified in classical (C-type BSE) and atypical forms. Both C-type BSE and atypical forms have been detected in cattle indigenous to most European countries, the Americas, and Asia and the Pacific. BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease.

"The C-type BSE epizootic resulted from oral exposure to prions in the ruminant-derived protein of meat-and-bone meal and milk replacers included in animal feedstuffs. As a result of control measures, C-type BSE epizootics are in decline.

"Experimental transmissibility of all forms of BSE to cattle has been demonstrated. The C-type BSE agent is also believed to be the common source, via dietary routes, of TSEs in other ruminant species and felidae. There is evidence of a causal link between the C-type BSE agent and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans. Recommendations for handling BSE-infected material assume that BSE is a zoonosis and manipulations with potentially contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by biorisk analysis.

"Identification of the agent: Clinical C-type BSE had a peak incidence in cattle aged between 4 and 5 years during the height of the epizootic. The clinical course is variable but can extend to several months. Overt clinical signs are distinctive, if differential diagnoses can be eliminated. Early clinical signs may be subtle and mostly behavioral, and may lead to disposal of affected animals before suspicion of BSE is triggered. In countries with a statutory policy toward the disease, clinically suspect cases must be killed, the brain examined and the carcass destroyed. Now, in most countries involved, active surveillance at abattoirs and the screening of fallen stock identifies preclinical cases and cases in which there may have been unrecognized clinical signs. No diagnostic test is currently available for live animals." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.05_BSE.pdf)
