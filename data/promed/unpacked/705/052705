Poisonous poppy seeds have sent a number of people around Australia to hospital with severe symptoms -- from muscle cramping and spasms to seizures and cardiac arrests -- prompting a nationwide recall of certain batches and brands of this common pantry item.

We [the article coauthors] work for 2 major poisons information services (New South Wales and Queensland), where we have been advising and caring for people with poppy seed poisoning. There have also been cases in Victoria, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Western Australia.

To date [16 Nov 2022], there have been around 32 cases of poppy seed toxicity reported in Australia over the past month, all in adults.

This is what we know about what's behind these cases and what you need to do if you've consumed poppy seeds recently, or have poppy seeds in your kitchen cupboards.

The poppy seeds involved in the latest national recall are non-food-grade seeds not intended for human consumption and are not safe to consume. Investigations are underway to determine how non-food-grade seeds ended up in the shops. Food-grade poppy seeds -- the type you'd usually see sprinkled on cake or bread -- are not dangerous.

Poppy seeds come from the poppy plant _Papaver somniferum_. This plant produces a number of chemicals called alkaloids. Some, like morphine and codeine, have been used medicinally for thousands of years to treat pain and other conditions. Other naturally occurring poppy alkaloids -- such as thebaine, noscapine, laudanosine and papaverine -- are less well described in terms of their effects on humans, but they can have a wide range of toxic effects.

Different varieties of poppy plants contain different amounts of these alkaloids. Some have very low amounts, which tend to be used to produce food-grade poppy seeds. Varieties with higher amounts are used to produce medicines, such as morphine and codeine.

The non-food-grade poppy seeds that incorrectly entered the human food supply contain high amounts of the alkaloid thebaine. Thebaine has very different effects to morphine. In large doses, it causes severe and prolonged muscle cramps, spasms, seizures and cardiac arrests, as seen in the recent cluster of poisonings. High concentrations of thebaine have been identified in the blood of affected people in this latest cluster.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st time that thebaine has entered the food chain in Australia. However, there are a couple of reports of people who have had severe toxicity after consuming non-food-grade poppies in recent decades.

All reported cases in the current cluster at the time of the recall occurred after people consumed poppy seeds as part of a drink -- similar to a brewed tea. Most people had consumed more than 100 g of poppy seeds (about 11 tablespoons), although 50 g (5-6 tablespoons) may be sufficient to cause poisoning. Thebaine can build up in the body if you ingest it several times over the same day.

There have been no reports to date of people being poisoned after eating poppy seeds in baked goods. However, the investigation is ongoing. Owing to the nature of the contamination, we'd recommend avoiding poppy seeds from affected brands in any form.

The non-food-grade poppy seeds we're currently concerned about likely entered the food supply in the past 2 months. So, if you bought poppy seeds before 22 Sep 2022, these are likely to be safe (http://www.health.vic.gov.au/health-alerts/health-warning-on-poppy-seeds).

If you've bought poppy seeds in the past 2 months and these are listed as part of the national recall, you may be at risk (http://www.Foodstandards.gov.au/industry/foodrecalls/recalls/pages/default.aspx?k=poppy). You can throw them in the bin or return them to where you bought them for a refund.

If you or someone you know develops the following symptoms after consuming poppy seeds, seek urgent medical assistance by calling triple zero:

- Severe muscle cramping, muscle spasms and abnormal movements
- Seizures
- Collapses or is unresponsive

If symptoms are mild, or you're not sure if these are because of consuming poppy seeds, call the Poisons Information Centre for advice (details below).

If you've consumed poppy seeds more than 4 hours ago and you feel fine, you can be reassured. That's because these poisoning symptoms typically happen quickly, within 4 hours.

If you've consumed a large number of poppy seeds as a drink, especially from an affected batch of seeds, in the past 4 hours, go to the emergency department regardless of symptoms.

If this article raises health concerns for you or for someone you know about consuming poppy seeds, call the Poisons Information Centre (https://www.poisonsinfo.nsw.gov.au/) from anywhere in Australia on 131 126. This evidence-base advice is available 24 hours a day. For life-threatening symptoms, call 000.

A number of poppy seed products have been recalled after a series of poisonings around the country. Consumers are also being urged to check their pantries for seeds linked to the incidents after at least 12 people who developed unusual and severe symptoms and fell ill in NSW required urgent medical attention. Additional cases have been reported across Australia.

The poppy seeds are not food grade, a joint investigation by state and territory governments has found. "Ongoing investigations indicate the presence of unusually high levels of a naturally occurring chemical, thebaine, in the poppy seeds is likely causing this toxicity," NSW Health said in a statement on Tuesday [15 Nov 2022].

Thebaine is found in poppy varieties and is used in the production of prescription medications including opiates. Poppy seeds grown for food production generally have no detectable amounts of thebaine. Symptoms of thebaine poisoning include spasms, seizures and difficulty breathing.

The products being recalled include Hoyt's Poppy Seeds and Gaganis Premium Australian Poppy Seeds, and new information gathered during the investigation means no amounts of the poppy seeds should be eaten.

[Poppy seeds are tasty as a food-grade treat. However, the issue of these non-food-grade poppy seeds having gotten into the food chain is unfortunate and scary. If you have consumed poppy seeds in food, tea or other preparations and feel unwell, seek medical attention immediately. This may be a case of needing an emergency room. If you feel fine more than 4 hours after consumption, then likely your unwell feeling is from some other cause. You may still need medical attention, but the cause may not be from poppy seeds. - Mod.TG
