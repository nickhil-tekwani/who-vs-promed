Genetic resistance bred into wheat crops 40 years ago has begun to break
down, resurrecting the threat of crop plagues not seen since the last major
outbreak in the United States in the 1950s, a non-profit, international
wheat research group said yesterday.
According to scientists at the Mexico City-based International Wheat and
Maize Improvement Center, a new, mutated form of the stem-rust fungus --
that virtually disappeared after destroying as much as half of wheat yields
decades ago -- reappeared several weeks ago at an experimental farm in the
rainy highlands of Uganda. Infection of wheat by the mutated pathogen,
which is spread by wind-borne spores and causes formation of reddish
blisters, principally on stems and occasionally on leaves, threatens a
genetic fix introduced during the Green Revolution in the late 1950s and
early 1960s, the scientists said.

"The resurgence of stem rust in Uganda is alarming because it signals the
breakdown of a resistance gene that protects wheat in many countries," said
Timothy Reeves, the center's director.
Most affected would be eastern and southern Africa, where many crops
depend solely on the sr-31 resistance gene.
But the sr-2 gene complex, used throughout much of the rest of the world
and which is still able to inhibit infection, may not work as effectively
against the mutant.
The last major outbreak, which occurred in the United States in the
mid-1950s, destroyed up to 50 percent of wheat crops on many U.S. farms.
Reeves said research is needed using new biotechnology methods, like
molecular marking, to understand the sr-2 resistance and possibly develop
more defenses against crop diseases like stem rust, leaf rust and yellow rust.
One thing is sure: The spores won't stay on the African savanna where they
first appeared. "It'll move," Reeves said. "It will travel."

[These reports may be somewhat alarmist, but they do point out the
necessity for plant pathologists and geneticists to continue monitoring the
appearance of unusual fungal isolates. There are two basic issues at hand.
Firstly, the reappearing isolate is virulent on wheat cultivars containing
the sr31 gene. Other resistance genes are available that might provide
protection, but the range of virulence to these genes in unknown.
Reappearance of the mutant provides a wake-up call that stem rust continues
to be a threat, and that one cannot rely on single-gene sources for
resistance.
Secondly, the risks of spread can be estimated. East Africa is vulnerable
because of environmental conditions and prevalence of susceptible hosts.
Spread to northern and southern Africa would be much slower because of
large intervening areas where there are few susceptible hosts. Natural
introduction into North America is very unlikely but
introduction via humans carrying infected plant material is always a
danger. - Mod.DH]
