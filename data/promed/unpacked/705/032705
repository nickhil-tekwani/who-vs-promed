Belgian authorities found the H5N8 bird flu virus at a farm north of Brussels on [Wed 1 Feb 2017] and imposed measures to contain the spread of the highly contagious virus, the Belgian agriculture ministry said on its website on [Thu 2 Feb 2017].

The virus was found at a site belonging to a bird enthusiast in the area of Lebbeke [East Flanders].

"The highly pathogenic character of this virus strain has yet to be confirmed," it said, adding the authorities established a 3 km sanitary perimeter around the site. It said there were no poultry farms in that area.

"The virus that has been severely affecting neighboring countries for several months has now reached Belgium. At this stage, the professional sector is not affected, but we must remain very vigilant," Belgian Agriculture Minister Willy Borsus said in the statement.

"A strict application of bio-security measures is essential for this case to remain isolated," he said. The ministry added Belgian consumers were facing no risks.

Various strains of the bird flu virus have been found in recent months in Germany, France, Italy, Greece and Portugal, as well as elsewhere around the world.

[This 1st HPAI H5N8 in Belgium was duly reported to the OIE on [Fri 3 Feb 2017]; see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=22703. The notification specified 6 species of ornamental birds on the holding:
species/susceptible/deaths/destroyed
Common pheasant:_Phasianus colchicus_(Phasianidae)/ 1 / 0 / 1
Greylag Goose:_Anser anser_(Anatidae)/ 13/ 1 / 12
Muscovy Duck: _Cairina moschata_(Anatidae)/ 7 / 0 / 7
Common Guineafowl:_Numida meleagris_(Numididae)/ 3 / 2 / 1
Indian Peafowl:_Pavo cristatus_(Phasianidae)/ 7 / 0 / 7
Phasianidae (unidentified):_Phasianidae (incognita)_(Phasianidae)/ 36 / 9 / 27

Belgium becomes Europe's 27th country affected by the HPAI H5N8 virus in poultry and/or wildfowl. This virus strain has been reported from Belgium's neighbors Netherlands, Germany and France since late 2016; Luxembourg remains currently Belgium's only neighbor from where the virus has not yet been reported.

Detected in early June 2016 in wild birds in Tyva (Russian Federation), H5N8 HPAI has been spreading globally, probably along wild birds' migratory routes. Since mid-October [2016], H5N8 was reported in several species of wild or domestic birds in India, in 27 countries in Europe (Hungary, Poland, Croatia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Russian Federation, Finland, Romania, France, Serbia, Ukraine, UK, Bulgaria, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Italy, Ireland, Spain, FYROM, Portugal and now Belgium), in 4 countries in Africa (Egypt, Tunisia, Nigeria and Uganda), and in Iran, Israel, Kuwait and China. - Mod.AS
