A highly infectious and contagious animal disease that wasn't known to be present in Singapore has been reported in local rabbits.

The Animal & Veterinary Service (AVS) of the National Parks Board (NParks) has confirmed the 1st detection of rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in local pet rabbits on 16 Sep [2020]. The virus that causes RHD was detected in samples from pet rabbits submitted by a veterinary clinic, said AVS:

"Based on investigations so far, there may be up to 11 affected rabbits in the cluster, and 8 have died. None of the cases are known to have a travel history. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing."

The agency has advised stakeholders to put in place "strict biosecurity protocols to minimise risk of disease transmission between rabbits from different households." This includes setting up sanitation, disinfection, and isolation areas and to report suspect cases to AVS.

Typically, rabbits that are housed indoors and have minimal exposure to rabbits from other households face low risk of contacting RHD.

According to veterinary clinic "The Animal Doctors," the particular strain of RHD virus detected in the local cases is caused by the virus RHDV2.

RHDV2 emerged around 2010 in Europe and caused outbreaks in animals that had immunity to an earlier strain (RHDV). RHDV2 is currently widespread in the UK, US, and Australia.

The disease is highly infectious. Rabbits can be infected with the virus through inhalation, ingestion, or by absorption through scrapes and wounds.

The virus replicates in the affected rabbit's liver, causing cell death and liver failure. This, in turn, leads to multiple blood clots forming throughout its bloodstream (known as disseminated intravascular coagulation). The increased clotting depletes the rabbit's supply of platelets, leading to excessive bleeding, especially in its lungs, heart, and kidneys.

Symptoms of the disease include fever, loss of appetite, lethargy, muscle spasms, breathing difficulties, blue lips, or bleeding from the mouth and nose. The symptoms typically appear 1-5 days after a rabbit is exposed to the virus.

The disease is also highly contagious. It can be transmitted by direct contact with an infected rabbit, its carcass, or any item, equipment, or even person who had contact with another infected rabbit.

Surviving rabbits can continue to shed the virus for at least a month after they recover. On the bright side, the disease is not zoonotic and does not affect humans or other animal species.

'The Animal Doctors' added that RHD has a mortality rate of nearly 100% in some populations.

"The disease process can also be very rapid, with some rabbits appearing perfectly normal the night before and owners discovering a dead body the next morning."

There is no treatment for RHD, but vaccines that can provide immunity against RHDV2 are available.

AVS will be working with veterinary clinics and distributors on importing and registering vaccines for RHD.

[RHD is notifiable to the OIE. In Singapore's last (2019) report to the OIE, RHD is included among the animal diseases "never reported."

The causative agent is rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), family Caliciviridae, genus _Lagovirus_.

OIE's Technical Disease Card for RHD (updated January 2019), addressing aetiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and control, and references, is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Animal_Health_in_the_World/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/RHD.pdf. From the disease card, we present an abridged text of the section "aetiology":

"RHDV was identified in 1984 as the agent of a highly contagious, acute, and fatal disease of rabbits (RHD).

Rabbit lagoviruses consist of pathogenic viruses (RHDVs) and non-pathogenic viruses (RCVs), related but genetically divergent. Phylogenetic analyses of pathogenic RHDV strains indicate the existence of 3 distinct groups: the "classic RHDV" with the genogroups G1-G5 isolated from 1984 onwards, the antigenic variant RHDVa/G6 identified in 1996, and RHDV2 identified in 2010. The RHDV and RHDVa are phylogenetically related, and their capsid protein (VP60) differs in nucleotide diversity from RHDV2 by more than 15%.

RHDV2 was first identified in France in 2010, and since then has spread throughout Europe, replacing the circulating RHDV/RHDVa strains in most European countries. The available data suggest that RHDV2 is a newly emerged virus of unknown origin. Its antigenic profile is quite different from that of RHDV, to such an extent that it could be considered a distinct serotype. The provisional name RHDV2, therefore, seems more appropriate than RHDVb, which is used by some authors. In addition to RHDV, RCVs have been identified, both in commercial and wild rabbits, that are genetically related to RHDV to varying degrees. Among these RCVs, those most closely genetically related to RHDV (identified in several European rabbit farms) induce a good level of cross-protection towards RHD. Other RCVs genetically less related to RHDV have been identified in Australian wild rabbit populations, and infected rabbits showed a very limited degree of protection, if any, when challenged with RHDV." - Mod.AS
