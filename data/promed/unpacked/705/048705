Egypt has reported another human case of avian flu on Tue 12 Jun
2007. A girl from Qena, south of Cairo, has been reported transferred
to a hospital after she was diagnosed with the deadly bird flu, Abdel
Rahman Shahin, spokesman for the Egyptian Ministry of Health, said in
a press release.
The girl, 4, is the 36th person infected with the H5N1 virus in
Egypt. 16 of those infected have died from the disease.
At the same hospital, another man is being treated for symptoms that
may be due to the virus. The hospital in Qena is currently running
tests to determine whether another infection has been discovered.
Egypt is the worst hit nation outside East Asia, where the deadly
disease was 1st discovered in humans. That the country is on a major
migratory route for birds is the main reason that Egypt has been hit
with the disease.
Many of the victims have come into contact with infected dead birds,
which occurs mostly in the near vicinity of their homes.

[The WHO reports 36 cases of human H5N1 avian influenza virus
infections, with 15 deaths (one less than the 16 reported above). It
is true that Egypt is located on a major bird migration route, but
one must not automatically assume that migratory birds, and not
movement of domestic poultry, are responsible for the introduction of
the virus into the country. Establishing indemnity payment for culled
poultry is not a simple matter: if the payments are less than current
market value, outbreaks are likely to go unreported and especially
valuable birds hidden or moved to avoid their sacrifice. Education is
critical to insure proper disposal of culled or other dead infected
birds to avoid exposure of other poultry populations or of humans to
the virus.
