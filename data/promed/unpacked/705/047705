Since [1 Jan 2017], Utah public health has identified 152 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

[2] Utah Foodhandler Infections

Thousands of people may have been exposed to hepatitis A in Utah amid a widening outbreak that originally spread from a large epidemic in San Diego, health officials said on [Wed 9 Jan 2018]. Infected workers may have exposed customers at 2 Salt Lake City area restaurants and a convenience store, authorities said. All 3 locations were linked to a Utah outbreak that began in August 2017 among Salt Lake City's homeless population and illicit drug users.

Tests connected it to an outbreak in San Diego that killed 20 people and sickened hundreds more, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp. It was the worst epidemic of its kind in the USA in 20 years. California officials have said the San Diego epidemic has eased but is not over yet.

Utah officials believe the disease spread as people moved between homeless centers in the 2 states, Rupp said. Utah has confirmed 152 cases so far [as above, only 133 of the 152 cases are linked to the southern California outbreak - Mod.LL] and no deaths have been reported.

Homeless people are especially vulnerable because they often don't have easy access to sanitation, Rupp said. Outbreaks in Arizona and Colorado have also been linked to San Diego, he said.

People can also spread it long before they know they've been infected because it has a long incubation time of up to 7 weeks. Anyone who might have been exposed is urged to contact health officials, and possibly get vaccinated.

A Sonic Drive-In and an Olive Garden in the Salt Lake City suburb of Spanish Fork each had an infected employee working in late December 2017, possibly exposing hundreds and possibly thousands of people, said Utah County Health Department spokeswoman Aislynn Tolman-Hill.

As many as 2000 more people could have been exposed by an employee at a 7-Eleven store in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan. No confirmed cases have been linked to any of the 3 locations yet. The time period where people might show symptoms in the West Jordan case is only just beginning, Rupp said.

Representatives from Olive Garden and 7-Eleven said in separate statements they have thoroughly sanitized their facilities in coordination with health officials and won't allow infected employees back to work until cleared by a doctor. Both restaurants said they're also vaccinating all their workers as a precaution. Sonic said their employee wasn't aware of being infected, and has since left the drive-in. They say the location has a good inspection history and is working with the health department.

Frequent hand-washing helps prevent infection. The hepatitis A vaccine is typically given to babies starting at age 1, and has been a requirement for kindergarten entry in Utah since 2002.

Regarding hepatitis A infection occurring among food handlers in the USA, the CDC publication (1) comes to the conclusion that there had been a decrease in food handler infections with HAV probably related to the use of universal childhood immunization in the USA and that mandatory vaccination of food handlers for HAV is unlikely to be cost-effective. A more recent publication (2), also from the CDC, tries to quantify the financial burden of the public health responses to such episodes.

Both of these papers derived their data from a time prior to the onset of the 3 significant foci of acute hepatitis A currently ongoing, San Diego County, southeast Michigan and Utah. These clusters reflect a different epidemiology of HAV transmission; that of poor sanitation in high risk individuals, rather than foodborne outbreaks and certainly change the numbers of cases in the USA during the current time period. While the USA workforce is becoming immune to HAV by universal childhood immunization, clearly a substantial percentage of the population is still susceptible to HAV infection. Especially during such outbreaks, which are spilling over into food handlers, a policy to vaccinate food handlers in commercial establishments seems to merit more serious consideration to protect the public as a whole. Just as we do not expect to get influenza or measles from infected healthcare workers while hospitalized, we should not expect to get hepatitis A from an infected food handler while eating in a restaurant.

Abstract
--------
"We reviewed news reports of hepatitis A virus (HAV)-infected food handlers in the USA from 1993 to 2011 using the LexisNexis® search engine. Using USA news reports, we identified 192 HAV-infected food handlers who worked while infectious; of these HAV-infected individuals, 34 (18 percent) transmitted HAV to restaurant patrons. News reports of HAV-infected food handlers declined from 1993 to 2011. This analysis suggests that universal childhood vaccination contributed to the decrease in reports of HAV-infected food handlers, but mandatory vaccination of this group is unlikely to be cost-effective."

Abstract
--------
"When food handlers become ill with hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection, state and local health departments must assess the risk of HAV transmission through prepared food and recommend or provide postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for those at risk for HAV infection. Providing PEP (eg, hepatitis A [HepA] vaccine or immunoglobulin), however, is costly. To describe the burden of these responses on state and local health departments, we determined the number of public health responses to HAV infections among food handlers by reviewing public internet sources of media articles. We then contacted each health department to collect data on whether PEP was recommended to food handlers or restaurant patrons, the number of PEP doses given, the number of HepA vaccine or immunoglobulin doses given as PEP, and the mean number of health department person-hours required for the response. Of 32 public health responses identified from Twitter, HealthMap, and Google alerts from [1 Jan 2012], to [31 Dec 2014], a total of 27 (84 percent) recommended PEP for other food handlers or restaurant patrons or both. Per public health response, the mean cost per dose of the HepA vaccine or immunoglobulin was USD 34 139; the mean personnel cost per response was $USD 7329; and the total mean cost of each response was USD 41 468. PEP is expensive. Less aggressive approaches to PEP, such as limiting PEP to fellow food handlers in nonoutbreak situations, should be considered in the postvaccination era. HepA vaccine for PEP provides long-term immunity and can be used when immunoglobulin is unavailable or cannot be administered within 14 days of exposure to HAV."
