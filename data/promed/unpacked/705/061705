VICTORIA's biggest outbreak of Legionnaire's disease has struck 10 people -
and health authorities fear more victims. Late yesterday 10 people from
the Thomastown-Reservoir area had tested positive to the potentially fatal
illness. And a further five people in hospital with pneumonia are
suspected but not yet confirmed. Of the positive cases, nine remain in
hospital, including two men who are in a critical but stable condition in
intensive care. Seven of the others are stable and one has been
discharged.
The Department of Human Services believes the source is a cooling tower in
an industrial estate in Thomastown, north of Mahoneys Rd. Officers have
tested, disinfected or closed about 12 of more than 25 cooling towers in
the area and should know the source this week.
"It's the most number of cases we've had from a Legionnaire's outbreak,"
Victoria's chief health officer, Dr Graham Rouch, said yesterday. "There
still could be cases to be diagnosed in people incubating the disease, as
the incubation period is up to 10 days."
Those infected either worked in the area north of Mahoneys Rd, or lived in
residential areas just to the south, bordering on Reservoir. All patients,
except one who is at St Vincent's Hospital, are in the Northern Hospital at
Epping.
