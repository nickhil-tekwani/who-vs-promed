The Metro Health Department reported today [31 Mar 2014] that syphilis is on the increase, and refers to the venereal disease as an "epidemic gripping San Antonio," 1200 WOAI news reports.

The rate of congenital syphilis in Bexar County [the county in which the city of San Antonio is located, in Texas] is 8 times higher than the 2012 national average and is the highest rate among the large urban counties in Texas. Congenital syphilis passes from a mother to baby, and causes lifelong incurable disabilities, such as blindness, seizures, and severe learning disabilities, and is frequently fatal.

The total number of syphilis cases in Bexar County in 2[0]12 jumped 15.2 percent, to 1070.

The rate of primary and secondary syphilis infections in men is 6 times that of women.

"San Antonio's syphilis epidemic is now in its 9th year of continuous growth," Metro Health Director Dr. Thomas Schlenker said. "The 17 babies born with congenital syphilis in 2013 are exceeded only by the 18 babies born in 2012. Only a deeply committed collaboration between Metro Health and local health care practitioners can halt this terrible plague."

[The incidence rate of primary and secondary syphilis for the US as a whole was 5.0 per 100 000 population (15 667 cases) in 2012 and the incidence rate for the US state of Texas was 6.3 per 100 000 population (1627 cases), the 6th highest of the 50 states, in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/26.htm). The incidence rate of primary and secondary syphilis for the city of San Antonio, Texas fluctuated from 9.6 in 2008, to 10.4 in 2009, 8.5 in 2010 and 8.6 in 2011, but rose to 15.0 in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/30.htm).

According to the news report above, the total number of syphilis cases in Bexar County, the county in which San Antonio is located, in 2012 was 1070. However, the CDC reports that Bexar County had only 321 cases of primary and secondary syphilis (and an incidence rate of 18.3) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/33.htm). Perhaps the news report above is referring to the number of cases of all stages of syphilis in Bexar County; the CDC reports that the number of cases of all stages of syphilis in San Antonio in 2012 is 983 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/25.htm).

In Texas, the incidence rate among males rose from a low of about 4.5 in 2003 to a high of 10.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012 compared to the US male rate of 9.3 in 2012; the rate among females has been relatively flat, but was 2.1 compared to the US female rate of 0.9 in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2012/TX12.pdf).

The CDC reports the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in males in Bexar County was 30.8 (265 cases) in 2012, almost double what it was in 2011, with a male-to-female rate ratio of 4.9 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/34.htm), not a rate ratio of 6 as reported in the news release above.

The increased incidence of syphilis in the US is occurring mainly among young men, and is associated in particular with men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/STD-Trends-508.pdf), as has been reported in many parts of the world (see previous ProMED-mail postings listed below). In the US in 2012, 75 percent of the reported primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis cases were among MSM (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/). However, outbreaks among men who have sex with women only (MSW) and women continue to occur in certain jurisdictions (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/syphilis.htm and ProMED-mail post Syphilis & gonococcal disease - USA (02): (ND) increased incidence 20140227.2303196.)

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. Grindr allows users to meet other men using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue" -- that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex.

Although Texas ranked 3rd among 30 states reporting at least one case of congenital syphilis in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2012/TX12.pdf), the number of cases of congenital syphilis in Texas was highest in 2008 (127 cases) and 2009 (128 cases) and progressively fell in the subsequent 3 years to 78 cases in 2012, with falling incidence rates (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/tables/42.htm). The CDC reported Texas had a congenital syphilis rate of 19.4 cases per 100 000 live births compared to the US rate of 7.8 in 2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2012/TX12.pdf), and according to the news report above, Bexar County had a congenital syphilis rate that was 8 times higher than the 2012 national average. For a discussion of congenital syphilis, see ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA (03): (TX) congenital, rising incidence 20130818.1886533.

San Antonio, with a population of 1.3 million, is the 7th most populous city in the US and the 2nd most populous city in Texas; San Antonio is located in the south-central part of the state and serves as the seat of Bexar County (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio). - Mod.ML
