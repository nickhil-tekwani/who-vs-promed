A foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak near the Russian border with China has been reported by the Russian Ministry of Agriculture.

[The report informs about] 83 cases of FMD from 118 susceptible cattle in the Ivanovskiy region at the Village of Cheremkhovo. This outbreak stems from outbreaks in Russia dating back to June 2013.

Measures have been put in place to stop the spread of FMD including quarantines, movement restrictions, and disinfection of infected premises.

This disease outbreak is continuing to be monitored by Dr Evgeny Nepoklonov, Deputy Head at the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, in the Russian Ministry of Agriculture.

[The above information is based upon Russia's follow-up report No 9 since the start of this epizootic in June 2013. This report, addressing the 10th outbreak, is available -- with a map -- at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14006.

In fact, the epizootic is composed of 2 distinct epizootics, separated by thousands of kilometers and caused by FMDV serotype A of 2 genetically different genotypes. One started on 3 Jun 2013 in southwest Russia, northeast of the Black Sea, bordering northern Georgia. It is caused by FMDV A Iran-05 lineage. So far, 6 outbreaks have been recorded, in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, Krasnodar, and Kabardino-Balkar.

The other epizootic started on 24 Jun 2013 in Amur (Siberia), on the border with China, caused by the FMDV A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97, which is the same strain as the one reportedly circulating in China since the end of 2012. So far, 4 outbreaks have been recorded in Russia's Amur, the most recent one being the subject of this posting.

For an OIE summary of all 10 outbreaks combined, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014006_20130902_154102.pdf. The map included will demonstrate the distance between the 2 FMD serotype A epizootics in Russia. - Mod.AS
