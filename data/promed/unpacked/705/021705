Outbreak detection
------------------
On [8 Jan 2019], the Parasitology section of the Microbiology Unit, University Hospital of Bologna, Bologna, Italy (ParaLab-Bo) identified 10 cases of _Giardia_ infection. Considering the extraordinary number of cases diagnosed within one day, the medical parasitologist decided to inform the local public health office (LPHO). The ParaLab-Bo serves as the public laboratory for the identification of intestinal parasites in the Bologna province [Emilia-Romagna region]. All samples were from the 'Pianura Ovest' health district and all were from residents of a municipality of 7387 inhabitants (Municipality A) within the metropolitan city of Bologna, north-eastern Italy. General practitioners (GPs) reported 3 additional cases from the same municipality between [27 Dec 2018] and [2 Jan 2019]. In comparison, only one case was reported in the entire 'Pianura Ovest' health district from January to October 2018.

The 1st case interviews indicated consumption of tap water as the most likely source of infection, while involvement of a common food item was excluded. No history of recent travel abroad was reported by any cases. Therefore, in agreement with the definition by the European Food Safety Authority [6], an outbreak of giardiasis was declared in Municipality A on [8 Jan 2019]. A task force, including representatives from the authorities of Municipality A, the Public Health Department of Bologna (PHD-Bo), ParaLab-Bo, and the Unit of Food-borne and Neglected Parasites at the Istituto Superiore di Sanita of Rome (UFNP-Rome), was established to investigate the source of the outbreak and to apply control and preventive measures. Here, we report on the investigation of this outbreak.

Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical presentation
-------------------------------------------------------
The 1st case of giardiasis was, notified on [27 Dec 2018] (week 52); symptom onset was estimated to be around [11 Dec 2018] (week 50). 2 additional cases were reported by GPs within week 1 in 2019 [week ending 5 Jan 2019] in individuals living in the same municipality. Between week 51 in 2018 and week 2 in 2019 [16 Nov 2018-12 Jan 2019], 10 additional cases were diagnosed by ParaLab-Bo, but were either notified to the LPHO only after the identification of the outbreak (7 cases) or were not reported to the LPHO (3 cases). The 1st 4 cases diagnosed by ParaLab-Bo had a clinical onset between [20-23 Nov 2018 (week 47), with a rapid increase in the following weeks; up to 80% of cases fell ill between [28 Nov 2018] (week 48) and [25 Dec 2018] (week 52). The outbreak reached its peak in week 50, then gradually declined. The last case, likely due to secondary transmission, was reported on [8 May 2019] (week 19). Based on the epidemic curve (Figure 2 -- available at the source URL above]), the likely period of exposure for most cases spanned weeks 46 to 48 in 2018 [11 Nov-1 Dec 2018].

Results from the case-control study
-----------------------------------
The response rate to the structured questionnaire was 98.3% for cases (59/60) and 100% for controls (60/60), therefore the overall response rate was 99.2%. Multivariate analysis indicated that drinking tap water was independently associated with _Giardia_ infection and that infection was strongly correlated with the number of glasses consumed daily.

Conclusions
-----------
Our investigation indicates that passive surveillance of laboratory-confirmed cases did not allow for timely detection of an outbreak caused by a neglected pathogen, such as _G. duodenalis_. In turn, this highlights the need to increase awareness of giardiasis among GPs and paediatricians and to encourage routine diagnosis of the parasite in patients with persistent diarrhoea. A better appreciation of the health impact of giardiasis in Italy, as well as an improvement in the recording and reporting of cases, would contribute to progress in surveillance, including more timely recognition and management of outbreaks.

_Giardia_ transmitted by piped drinking water is unusual. It happens when open-air water reservoirs are contaminated with feces from animals excreting _Giardia_. The source of the contamination was not identified in this outbreak. - Mod.EP
