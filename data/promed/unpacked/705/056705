Bhutan: Conjunctivitis outbreak in Phuentsholing
------------------------------------------------
Students are the worst affected by the conjunctivitis or 'red eye'
infection which broke out in Phuentsholing a few weeks ago Phuentsholing
hospital doctors say. Since the outbreak, the Phuentsholing Hospital has
treated more than 800 infections of which 50 percent were students. The
infection is highly contagious and spreads easily from close contact. Many
others are being treated in private clinics in the neighbouring Indian town
of Jaigaon.
"About 10 percent of the patients coming to the hospital everyday are
suffering from conjunctivitis," stated Dr. A. Mukherjee of the
Phuentsholing General Hospital. Dr. Mukherjee added that [such] viral or
bacterial infection was seasonal and mostly surfaced during the monsoon
season. "But this year we have seen the largest number of infections."
While the infection was self-limiting and usually cured within a week Dr
Mukherjee said that proper preventive measures should be taken to prevent
the infection from getting worse [and developing into] corneal ulceration
or chronic conjunctivitis. He added that the infection in Phuentsholing was
bacterial.
Conjunctivitis may be transmitted to the eye by contaminated hands,
washcloths or towels, cosmetics (particularly eye makeup), improper usage
of contact lenses and close contact with infected people. Little children
are more vulnerable to conjunctivitis because of their poor hygiene. The
conjunctiva is a clear membrane that is the tough, leathery outer coat of
the eye with many small blood vessels that lubricate and protect the eye
while it moves in its socket. When the conjunctiva becomes inflamed due to
infection by bacteria, viruses, chemicals and allergies, it is called
conjunctivitis. The symptoms of conjunctivitis are itchy, watery and red
eyes, which are sometime swollen. The skin around the eyes also becomes red
and scaly.

[The identity of the infectious agent is unclear from this report. The
primary cause of the infection may be viral, with a secondary bacterial
infection which may respond to antibiotic treatment. Adenovirus type 11,
coxsackievirus type A24, and enterovirus type 70 are regularly associated
with acute conjunctivitis, and adenoviruses types 8, 19, and 37 with
epidemic keratoconjunctivitis. Further information would be welcomed. -

[Major causes of bacterial conjunctivitis in the normal host
are_Staphylococcus aureus_, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, _Neisseria
gonorrhoeae_, and _Haemophilus influenzae_. Care most be taken to avoid
misdiagnosing cases due to the gonococcus as well as trachoma chlamydial
disease. -Mod. LL]
