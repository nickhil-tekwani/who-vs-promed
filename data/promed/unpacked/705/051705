BARLEY YELLOW MOSAIC - SPAIN: 1ST REPORT: CORRECTION

There is an error in the 1st sentence of my comment on this piece. The
sentence should read as follows: "BaYMV and Barley mild mosaic virus
(BaMMV) are transmitted by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa graminis_."
This is not a bacillus.
ProMED-mail regrets the error.
