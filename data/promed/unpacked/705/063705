Researchers in Brazil have identified the emergence of a new lineage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Brazil that has spread across multiple states in the country.

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the agent responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that continues to pose a threat to global public health and the worldwide economy.

Marilda Siqueira from the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (Fiocruz) in Rio de Janeiro and colleagues say this new variant of interest (VOI) probably emerged in August 2020 and is already widely distributed in Brazil. Designated as N.9, the variant emerged in the B.1.1.33 lineage and comprised 35% of all B.1.1.33 sequences detected between November 2020 and February 2021.

The VOI N.9 harbors the E484K mutation in a surface structure called the spike protein, which the virus uses to bind to and infect host cells. The E484K mutation in spike (S: E484K) is considered one of the most critical mutations since it may contribute to immune evasion. Studies have shown that it confers resistance to some monoclonal antibodies and reduces the neutralization potency of sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals.

The researchers predict that the COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil during 2021 will be dominated by a complex array of 484K variants that will completely replace the parental 484E lineages that drove the epidemic during 2020. The team advises that efficient mitigation measures will be crucial to reducing community transmission across Brazil and preventing the recurrence of more transmissible variants that could further exacerbate the epidemic.

A pre-print version of the research paper is available on the bioRxiv server while the article undergoes peer review [see reference below].

More about the epidemic in Brazil
---------------------------------
The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was mainly driven by the B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 lineages that likely emerged in February 2020 before becoming the dominant variants in most regions by October 2020.

Since then, genomic studies revealed the emergence of 2 rapidly spreading variants (P.1 and P.2) within the B.1.1.28 lineage that harbor mutations in the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein.

Lineage P.1, which was first described in January 2020, is considered a variant of concern (VOC), as it harbors an unusually high number of spike mutations (including K417T, E484K, N501Y) and was associated with a 2nd epidemic wave in the state of Amazonas.

The P.2 lineage, which was 1st described in October 2020, only harbors E484K in the spike and 4 mutations that lie outside of the spike. This lineage, which is considered a variant of interest (VOI) was the most prevalent variant detected in several states during late 2020 and early 2021.

Several variants also emerged in the B.1.1.33 lineage, including the N.1 lineage detected in the US, N.2 detected in Suriname and France, N.3 circulating in Argentina, and lineages N.4 and B.1.1.314 circulating in Chile. However, none of the mutations identified in these new lineages harbored mutations of concern in the spike protein.

What did the current study involve?
-----------------------------------
Siqueira and colleagues conducted a genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2-positive samples sequenced by the Fiocruz COVID-19 Genomic Surveillance Network between [12 Mar 2020 and 27 Jan 2021]. They identified 422 sequences within the B.1.1.33 lineage that were then combined with B.1.1.33 Brazilian genomes that were available in the GISAID database EpiCoV by [1 Mar 2021].

Mutational profiling revealed that the S:E484K mutation was present in 34 of the B.1.1.33-derived sequences.

Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences identified a potential new VOI designated as lineage N.9 that contained the S:E484K mutation and was detected in different states across Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. The VOI N.9 was detected in 10 Brazilian states, suggesting that this lineage is already widely distributed across the country.

The variant was first detected in Sao Paulo on 11 Nov 2020, and then identified later in the South (Santa Catarina), North (Amazonas and Para), and Northeast (Bahia, Maranhao, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui, and Sergipe) regions.

"A major global shift in the SARS-CoV-2 fitness landscape"
----------------------------------------------------------
Further analysis suggested that the N.9 lineage probably emerged in Sao Paulo, Bahia, or Maranhao around [15 Aug 2020]. "The onset date of the VOI N.9 here estimated around mid-August [2020] roughly coincides with the estimated timing of emergence of the VOI P.2 in late-July [2020] and shortly precedes the detection of a major global shift in the SARS-CoV-2 fitness landscape after October 2020," write the researchers.

The team says the VOI N.9 is already widely distributed in the country and made up 35% of the B.1.1.33 sequences detected between November 2020 and February 2021.

Siqueira and colleagues say the S:E484K mutation has emerged independently in various different VOCs and VOIs that are spreading rapidly around the world. "It is probably an example of convergent evolution and ongoing adaptation of the virus to the human host," they write.

Efficient mitigation measures will be "crucial"
-----------------------------------------------
The researchers say they expect that the epidemic in Brazil during 2021 will be dominated by a complex array of B.1.1.28(484K) and B.1.1.33(484K) variants that will completely replace the parental 484E lineages that drove the epidemic in 2020. "Implementation of efficient mitigation measures in Brazil is crucial to reduce community transmission and prevent the recurrent emergence of more transmissible variants that could further exacerbate the epidemic in the country," concludes the team.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Summary
--------
"The SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Brazil was dominated by 2 lineages designated as B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33. 2 SARS-CoV-2 variants harboring mutations at the receptor-binding domain of the spike (S) protein, designated as lineages P.1 and P.2, evolved within lineage B.1.1.28 and are rapidly spreading in Brazil. Lineage P.1 is considered a variant of concern (VOC) because of the presence of multiple mutations in the S protein (including K417T, E484K, N501Y), while lineage P.2 only harbors mutation S:E484K and is considered a variant of interest (VOI). Here we report the identification of a new SARS-CoV-2 VOI within lineage B.1.1.33 that also harbors mutation S:E484K and was detected in Brazil between November 2020 and February 2021. This VOI displayed 4 non-synonymous lineage-defining mutations (NSP3:A1711V, NSP6:F36L, S:E484K, and NS7b:E33A) and was designated as lineage N.9. The VOI N.9 probably emerged in August 2020 and has spread across different Brazilian states from the Southeast, South, North, and Northeast regions."

"Conclusions
------------
"In this study, we identified the emergence of a new VOI (S:E484K) within lineage B.1.1.33 circulating in Brazil. The VOI N.9 displayed a low prevalence (~3%) among all Brazilian SARSCoV-2 samples analyzed between November 2020 and February 2021, but it is already widely dispersed in the country and comprises a high fraction (35%) of the B.1.1.33 sequences detected in that period. Mutation S:E484K has been identified as one of the most important substitutions that could contribute to immune evasion as confers resistance to several monoclonal antibodies and also reduces the neutralization potency of some polyclonal sera from convalescent and vaccinated individuals. Mutation S:E484K has emerged independently in multiple VOCs (P.1, B.1.351 and B.1.1.7) and VOIs (P.2 and B.1.526) 14 spreading around the world, and it is probably an example of convergent evolution and ongoing adaptation of the virus to the human host. The onset date of the VOI N.9 here estimated around mid-August roughly coincides with the estimated timing of emergence of the VOI P.2 in late-July [2020] and shortly precede the detection of a major global shift in the SARS-CoV-2 fitness landscape after October 2020. These findings indicate that 484K variants probably arose simultaneously in the 2 most prevalent viral lineages circulating in Brazil around July-August, but may have only acquired some fitness advantages which accelerated its dissemination after October 2020. We predict that the Brazilian COVID-19 epidemic during 2021 will be dominated by a complex array of B.1.1.28(484K), including P.1 and P.2, and B.1.1.33(484K) variants that will completely replace the parental 484E lineages that drove the epidemic in 2020. Implementation of efficient mitigation measures in Brazil is crucial to reduce community transmission and prevent the recurrent emergence of more transmissible variants that could further exacerbate the epidemic in the country."

[B] Massachusetts: 1st detected case of Brazil COVID-19 variant
Date: Tue 16 Mar 2021
Source: Boston.com [edited]
https://www.boston.com/news/coronavirus/2021/03/16/massachusetts-brazil-coronavirus-variant


Massachusetts officials announced the news Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] of the state's 1st known case of the [P.1] variant of COVID-19. According to the state's Department of Public Health [DPH], a woman in her 30s who lives in Barnstable County tested positive for COVID-19 in late February [2021], and subsequent genetic sequencing found that she has the P.1 variant of the virus, which was first discovered in Brazil last December [2020].

DPH officials, who were notified of the sequencing results through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's national surveillance system, said Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] that there is no information available on the woman's illness or whether she has recently traveled.

Researchers are still learning about the [P.1] variant, which has fueled a record-breaking surge in cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in the South American country since its discovery. Preliminary studies have found that -- similar to the other 2 well-known COVID-19 variants [first identified in] the United Kingdom and South Africa -- the mutated strain may be up to twice as contagious as the original version of the virus.

Researchers have also found that the [P.1] variant has gained the ability to reinfect individuals who already had COVID-19 and may weaken the protective effects of a Chinese vaccine being used in Brazil, as the New York Times recently reported [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/health/covid-19-coronavirus-brazil-variant.html].

However, the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine appears to remain highly effective against the P.1. variant, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week [see reference below]. And while vaccine manufacturers are working on boosters to protect against emerging variants, researchers have found that the shots from Pfizer and Moderna still offer strong, if slightly lower, protection against the new strains.

DPH officials said Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] that there have also been a total of 213 known cases of the United Kingdom variant, known as B.1.1.7, and 6 cases of the South Africa variants, known as B.1.351, reported in Massachusetts.

Officials noted that the more prevalent United Kingdom variant also caused a rapid surge of cases in the United Kingdom, several other countries, and parts of the United States. However, some experts are optimistic that the combination of declining cases and increasing vaccine coverage in the United States will prevent the same type of variant-fueled spike.

DPH noted Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] that the "best defense against variants of concern is to prevent the spread of COVID. This includes wearing a mask, social distancing, avoiding groups, staying home when you are sick, getting tested if you have symptoms or are identified as a close contact of someone with COVID, and getting vaccinated when it is your turn," officials said.

This correspondence analyses "effects on neutralization elicited by BNT162b2" which is a "nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine expressing the full-length prefusion spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving approximately 44 000 participants, immunization conferred 95% efficacy against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."

"As compared with neutralization of USA-WA1/2020, neutralization of B.1.1.7-spike and P.1-spike viruses was roughly equivalent, and neutralization of B.1.351-spike virus was robust but lower. Our data are also consistent with lower neutralization titers against the virus with the full set of B.1.351-spike mutations than against the virus with either subset of mutations. Our findings also suggest that mutations that result in amino acid substitutions K417N, E484K, and N501Y in the receptor-binding site have a greater effect on neutralization than the 242-244 deletion affecting the N-terminal domain of the spike protein."

Health officials in Brazil's most populous state, Sao Paulo, have called on the new health minister to consider imposing a national lockdown as coronavirus deaths continue to rise. On Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] Brazil recorded 2841 COVID-related deaths -- its highest ever daily total. Sao Paulo registered 679 deaths, also a record for the state.

Brazil has the 2nd highest number of infections and deaths in the world, behind the US. Brazil has registered more than 11.6 million infections and 282 000 deaths since the pandemic began. The latest surge in cases has been attributed to the spread of highly contagious variants of the virus [as discussed above in this post].

Health minister Marcelo Queiroga -- who will be formally appointed on Wednesday [17 Mar 2021] -- is the 4th person to hold the office since the pandemic began. In remarks to the media on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021], Mr Queiroga urged Brazilians to wear masks and wash their hands but stopped short of endorsing a lockdown or even social distancing measures. The cardiologist told CNN Brasil that while "lockdowns were used in extreme situations, they could not be government policy".

In total, the country has registered more than 11.6 million infections and 282 000 deaths since the pandemic began. The latest surge in cases has been attributed to the spread of highly contagious variants of the virus. Regional health systems are reported to be close to collapse with intensive care units almost at full capacity in 15 state capitals.

The government has also faced criticism for the slow rollout of vaccines. It is currently distributing the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Chinese-developed CoronaVac jabs and has placed orders for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson, and Russian Sputnik V vaccines. So far about 4.6% of the population has received at least one dose.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/17/covid-has-reached-my-hospital-in-papua-new-guinea-people-could-soon-be-dying-in-the-parking-lot


Port Moresby General Hospital is one of the few safe places for women to give birth, but 30% of our workforce has COVID-19 and we may have to shut our doors. At Port Moresby General Hospital, about 20% of women presenting in labour have symptoms of COVID-19. Of these, about 1/3 (4 to 5 women a day) test positive.

We get the test results back about 2 to 3 hours after we take the swabs, so often by the time the woman is delivering her baby it is too late to transfer her to the COVID isolation ward for the birth, and staff have attended to her and been exposed to the virus, without being able to don the appropriate level of PPE and practice other precautionary measures to protect themselves.

Since mid-February [2021], the rise in COVID cases in PNG [Papua New Guinea] has been exponential. Even with our low rates of testing our total numbers have gone from 1000 to 2300 in the past month and deaths from 10 to 25 in the same period.

We now see that about 10 of our nursing and medical staff are becoming COVID-19 positive every week, and the number is rising along with the community numbers. Positive staff are put off work until they test negative some weeks later. To date, we have lost 30% of our maternity department workforce.

Our midwifery protocols stipulate that one midwife should not have more than 4 women in labour to care for; however, now we find that we sometimes only have 2 midwives on duty for our labor ward of 30 beds -- all of which are typically full at any one time. Doctors are now filling in to provide a significant part of the midwifery care, especially on the night shift, but 3 of our 20 doctors have also tested positive this month [March 2021].

My concern is that we will reach a point in the near future where we will have insufficient staff to keep the doors open. If we get to this point, what will happen to the more than 50 women who present for pregnancy care every day? Some may make it home again with their severe pre-eclampsia or life-threatening bleeding or to give birth, while others may end up dying in the hospital car park.

The Port Moresby General Hospital (PMGH) is the only hospital in the capital of PNG that offers maternity care for public patients. The service is basically free, and most of the time we are able to provide basic care for the 20 000 women who are admitted to our service each year without any additional cost to them.

Over the past 50 years, in the 92-93% of women who are booked for pregnancy care in our city's antenatal clinics, we have managed to achieve the lowest level of perinatal (babies) death of any public maternity in the low-to-middle-income world (18-19/1000) while having possibly the lowest caesarean section rate of any large public maternity in the world (5-6%).

In the rest of PNG, only about 50% of the country's (mainly rural) pregnant women are able to access pregnancy and birthing care. This results in PNG having some of the highest national maternal and perinatal death statistics in the world. Port Moresby General Hospital has a track record to be proud of, but it is all possibly about to end -- because the COVID-19 epidemic has finally reached PNG.

The same scenario is playing out in the general part of Port Moresby General Hospital. The COVID-19 isolation ward has been full for the past week; now we have taken over one of the medical wards to be an additional COVID-19 ward. In addition, each part of the hospital has a small isolation area for COVID-19 positive cases that are admitted with other problems and then found to be positive in the course of their admission. All of these are mostly full as well.

When the general hospital staff reach levels where the emergency department is unable to maintain the service, then its doors will close as well. Then we will have people who have car accidents, knife wounds, TB, typhoid, etc., dying in the main car park, or being sent home to their fate.

We need a vaccine urgently, but by the time it reaches us, it could be too late to save the health service of Port Moresby.

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/mar/16/covid-vaccine-fast-tracked-in-torres-strait-as-fears-of-papua-new-guinea-outbreak-grow


As Papua New Guinea teeters on the brink of a catastrophic outbreak of COVID-19, there are fears that complacency with border security could result in the virus reaching the Torres Strait and then mainland Australia.

COVID-19 cases in Papua New Guinea have jumped alarmingly over the last fortnight. The Pacific nation has reported a total of 2269 cases and 26 deaths over the course of the pandemic but there are fears that the true rate of community transmission is much higher and is masked by low testing rates.

Fears about the spread of COVID-19 have led to the fast-tracking of the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the Torres Strait this week, including on the island of Saibai which is only a short dinghy ride south of PNG's Western province. A Queensland Health spokesperson said this week 40 people on Saibai had been vaccinated, with plans to start vaccinating people on Boigu and Dauan islands next week [week of 22 Mar 2021].

"While I am really happy the vaccine is being rolled out in the community, especially with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in PNG, we cannot be complacent," the Torres Strait Island regional council mayor, Phillemon Mosby, told the Guardian. "Our communities are small and with overcrowded living conditions. Just one case in the community would spread rapidly, our people are vulnerable, and an outbreak would be catastrophic.

"Our people move around between islands and with the conflicting news stories about the safety of the vaccines, many people are not sure if it is safe, so who can say that 100% of people on Saibai are being vaccinated this week or Boigu next week?"

There is normally a porous border between PNG and the Torres Strait, and movements of traditional inhabitants can reach up to 50 000 a year under the Torres Strait treaty. But since March last year [2020], all cross-border movements have been suspended. An Australian Border Force [ABF] spokesperson said the ban on all cross-border travel would remain "until further notice" and ABF was "closely monitoring the situation in close cooperation with Australian and Papua New Guinea (PNG) counterparts."

Over the past year the ABF has committed significant air, sea, and land-based resources, the ABF spokesperson said, including ships, fast-response boats, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and personnel deployments. This approach had resulted in a significant reduction in cross-border incursions, which had helped protect the Torres Strait region from COVID-19.

Mosby urged the government to keep the borders closed until widespread vaccination had occurred and Australia had a better sense of how widespread community transmission was in PNG. "I am aware the Australian Government are having talks with the PNG government in terms of us helping roll out the vaccine there but given what is happening across the rest of the world right now, we do not want the border opened prematurely," he said. "We need our people vaccinated and the border kept shut until we can get such information of how many people have been screened in PNG, how many have been vaccinated, and allow time for that process to take its course.

"It may be that it is under-resourced, and it could be the window of opportunity for the virus to come into our country."

Australia will immediately provide 8000 COVID-19 vaccine doses and critical health equipment to Papua New Guinea (PNG) due to the spike in new coronavirus infections in the country, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday [17 Mar 2021]. Australia will also request AstraZeneca PLC and European authorities to grant access to one million doses of the country's contracted vaccines for PNG, Morrison said.

Australia will also suspend all charter flights for 2 weeks from Wednesday midnight and outbound travel to the country, the prime minister said.

The Pacific island nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG) is facing a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections around the capital Port Moresby, which neighbouring Australia and aid groups fear could overwhelm the country's small and overstretched health system. The Pacific Friends of Global Health warned if health services are overwhelmed by COVID-19 the treatment of malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis would also collapse.

Half the COVID-19 tests from PNG processed by Australia have been positive, prompting calls for faster vaccine delivery. "Out of the 500 tests that our health authorities have done for PNG, 250 have come back positive," Australia's Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told reporters on Monday [15 Mar 2021]. PNG's Western Province lies within a few kilometres of Australia's northern border, and Queensland laboratories are assisting to investigate the worsening outbreak.

Palaszczuk said Papua New Guinea was "on the doorstep" and she held real concern about the rising infection rate there. 97 new cases were recorded on Sunday [15 Mar 2021], bringing the total to 2269 and 26 deaths, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said on Monday [15 Mar 2021]. Almost a quarter of those cases were recorded in the past week, a WHO tally shows. COVID-19 infections have been recorded in 19 provinces.

The latest outbreak is centred on the National Capital District in Port Moresby, where more than 1000 cases have been recorded, and comes after the nation mourned the death of its 1st prime minister, Sir Michael Somare. "We were already at this absolute crisis point for the country," Brendan Crabb, chairman of the Pacific Friends of Global Health, told Reuters in a telephone interview. "Added to that is the Grand Chief Michael Somare's commemorations over the past week, which if ever there was a super-spreading event in the middle of an already big epidemic, clearly that's it." Somare will be buried on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021]. Marape told reporters an isolation strategy would be announced on Wednesday [17 Mar 2021].

The national and supreme courts shut on Monday [15 Mar 2021] for 2 weeks after 4 court staff including 2 judges tested positive, the court registrar said in a website statement.

The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is not planned to be rolled out until late April [2021], through the COVAX initiative which has allocated one million doses to the Pacific. "We need Papua New Guinea's 5000 or so healthcare workers vaccinated in the next week or two," said Crabb.

Australia has pledged to spend AUD 407 million [about USD 314 million] for regional vaccine access covering 9 Pacific Island countries.

[Papua New Guinea has a population approaching 9 million inhabitants. The series of media reports above paint a very serious situation as the virus has taken hold and the limited resources available are approaching an overwhelmed state - mirroring situations seen in many other countries around the world. As my colleague Mod.LXL commented, this may be "a harbinger of what may happen to other under-resourced countries who will be among the last to receive adequate vaccine supplies". - Mod.MPP]

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of [14 Mar 2021], 10 am CET

Global overview
---------------
New cases continue to rise globally, increasing by 10% in the past week to over 3 million new reported cases (Table 1). The number of new cases peaked in early January 2021 when there were just under 5 million cases reported in one week. New cases then declined to just under 2.5 million cases by the week commencing [15 Feb 2021]. However, for the past 3 weeks, new cases have increased. This week, the Americas and Europe continue to account for over 80% of new cases and new deaths, with rises in new cases seen in all regions apart from Africa, where incidence rates remained similar to the previous week. New deaths on the other hand continue to decline and are now under 60 000, since peaking in the week commencing [18 Jan 2021] (when there were over 95 000 new deaths in the week). The last time when there were fewer than 60 000 new weekly deaths was four months ago, in the week commencing [9 Nov 2021]. This week, although new deaths declined globally, they rose in two WHO regions; the Eastern Mediterranean (by 7%) and the Western Pacific (by 14%).

The highest numbers of new cases were reported from Brazil (494 153 new cases; 20% increase), the United States of America (461 190 new cases; 8% increase), France (161 159 new cases; 12% increase), Italy (155 076 new cases; 12% increase), and India (148 249 new cases; 30% increase).

Special focus: building and maintaining trust -- what countries should do to prepare communities for a COVID-19 vaccine, treatment, or a new test
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we move to the next critical phase of the response, when vaccines and other biomedical tools become more widely available, building trust and engaging communities remains essential. We have learned from previous epidemic responses that when communities fully engage and actively participate in the full cycle of planning, delivery, and assessment for new biomedical tools, demand for these tools increases, leading to widespread and effective uptake and use.

Addressing community concerns
Social-behavioral data tell us that we have much to do in order to build and sustain trust in communities around the world.

People have concerns over the safety of vaccines and other biomedical tools made with unprecedented speed and with new technologies. These concerns must be acknowledged and addressed by providing individuals and communities with actionable, timely, and credible health information from trusted sources and by providing the space and follow-up necessary to work through these concerns with trusted health or community leaders. Past epidemics have shown us just how quickly and widely individual or community fears can spread if not dealt with in a timely and comprehensive way.

Recent studies suggest that around 65% of global populations surveyed are willing to be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine./1 But this has fluctuated over time. The proportion of those likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine varies significantly between regions and countries and within countries. The barriers to vaccine uptake are likely to be influenced by a large range of factors./2 These include exposure to misinformation and rumours, which can negatively impact vaccine confidence, as well as the role local health care professionals play in promoting vaccine uptake among their patients and communities./3

As the pandemic becomes protracted, pandemic fatigue is increasing. The growing fatigue, the stress caused by uncertainty, lower risk perceptions, and reduced trust in government responses, are taking a toll on the fabric of our communities. This has already led to stigma and discrimination in some settings as well as protests against public health and social measures in many countries.

This is why since the beginning of the pandemic, WHO has promoted and provided guidance on implementing a whole-of-society approach to ensure the widest array of stakeholders are actively involved in the introduction of new biomedical tools, while also supporting communities' broader trust in their health systems.

One of the ways WHO is supporting countries to strengthen their engagement and empowerment strategies is through the publication of the 10 Steps to Community Readiness [Figure 3.] -- What countries should do to prepare communities for a COVID-19 vaccine, treatment, or new test [https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/who-2019-nCoV-Community_Readiness-2021.1].

This is a new tool, developed by WHO, UNICEF, IFRC, and the Global Outbreak and Alert Response Network (GOARN) through the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Collective Service (a new partnership launched in June 2020), to strengthen coordination and quality of practice for the COVID-19 pandemic response.

3. PERC (2020) Responding to COVID-19 in Africa: using data to find a balance Part II; https://preventepidemics.org/covid19/perc/.

The tool is built around the recognition that the empowerment of people and communities is not an abstract idea, and there are concrete and measurable steps that can be taken to ensure citizens are engaged and ready to support new biomedical tools.

Though communication needs may be slightly different for each step, the principles that promote their safe and successful introduction remain the same.

The steps build on well-established RCCE principles that put communities at the heart of the roll-out of new vaccines, treatments, and tests and promote trust -- the critical ingredient for all community action.

With the imminent arrival of new biomedical tools, investments in coordinated and proactive community engagement approaches, such as the 10 Steps to Community Readiness, are now needed more than ever. These approaches not only support the widest possible uptake of new tools but also support the continued maintenance of protective behaviours, such as mask wearing and physical distancing.

Special focus: update on SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions, and researchers, continues to monitor the public the variants of concern (VOCs) is available in previously published editions of the Weekly Epidemiological Update [https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports].

Here we provide an update on the geographical distribution of the 3 VOCs, considered as such by WHO and as reported by countries, territories, and areas (hereafter countries) as of [16 Mar 2021]; and emerging variants of interest (VOIs).

As surveillance activities, including systematic genomic sequencing, are strengthened at local and national levels to detect cases infected with SARS-CoV-2 variants, the number of countries reporting VOCs has continued to increase (Table 2, Figures 4-6, Annex 2). This information should be interpreted with due consideration of limitations of ongoing surveillance, including but not limited to differences between countries in sequencing capacity and which samples are prioritized for sequencing. WHO continues to advocate for strengthening surveillance and sequencing capacity, and a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants; based on the local epidemiological situation and capacity, and the detection of unusual events.

Emerging variants of interest (VOIs)
------------------------------------
All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, change over time resulting in the emergence of new variants, most without a direct benefit to the virus or other public health impacts. WHO, in collaboration with national authorities, institutions, and researchers, routinely assesses if variants of SARS-CoV-2 result in changes in transmissibility, clinical presentation, and severity, or if they impact public health and social measures (PHSM). Systems have been established to detect "signals" of potential variants of interest or concern, as well as unusual events potentially associated with a variant, and assess these based on the risk posed to global public health (see also working definitions). Such signals are currently under assessment, and as new variants of interest VOIs or VOCs are determined, WHO is committed to highlighting these to support prioritization for further monitoring and assessment.

A SARS-CoV-2 variant, labelled CAL.20C/L452R (based upon the NextStrain subclade and key mutation), spanning PANGO lineages B.1.427 and B.1.429, has been designated as a VOI by WHO based on recent assessments and emerging evidence. This variant is characterized by a combination of 3 mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD), namely S13I, W152C, L452R, of which the focus is on the L452R mutation. It was first detected during a local increase in COVID-19 cases in California, United States of America in June 2020. Surveillance has shown that it has since contributed to a substantive proportion of local COVID-19 cases in California, and has been detected in all US states and at least 26 other countries to date/1-4. Outside of the US, reported detections of this VOI are currently limited to a relatively low number of sequences, suggesting it has not yet resulted in widespread disease in other countries.

The assessment as a VOI follows preliminary, emerging evidence that this variant may be associated with phenotypic impacts which may pose an increased public health risk and COVID-19 control measures compared to other variants. This includes a possible increase in transmissibility,/1 mixed findings on potentially higher infectivity (based on PCR cycle thresholds as a proxy),/1,5,6, and a slight reduction in neutralization for sera from recovered patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 and in vaccine recipients./1,7 The L452R mutation has been associated with a reduction in neutralization of monoclonal antibodies but further investigations are ongoing/8,9. The impact of this variant on disease severity is under investigation. These are preliminary findings, include non-peer review studies, and require further investigations. WHO is working with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the WHO Virus Evolution Working Group to further assess this VOI.

WHO recommendations and working definitions of VOI and VOC
----------------------------------------------------------
The potential for virus mutation increases with the frequency of human and animal infections. Therefore, reducing transmission of all circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses and variants by using established disease control methods, are critical aspects of the global strategy to reduce the occurrence of mutations that have negative public health implications. PHSM and infection prevention and control measures inside and outside of health facilities remain critically important to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including newly reported variants.

Evidence from multiple countries with extensive transmission of VOCs has indicated that the implementation of physical distancing and other PHSM, as well as infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in health facilities, has been effective in reducing COVID-19 case incidence, which has led to a reduction in hospitalizations and deaths among COVID-19 patients. Findings from new studies evaluating transmission, severity, and impact on medical countermeasures will continue to help inform PHSM and IPC measures employed by Member States. National and local authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening existing PHSM, IPC, and disease control activities, including epidemiological surveillance, strategic testing, and systematic sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 where feasible.

On [25 Feb 2021], proposed working definitions of SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern were published. As SARS-CoV-2 is continuously evolving, and new signals of potential VOIs and VOCs are frequently detected, WHO aims to assess potential VOCs based on the risk posed to global public health. National authorities may choose to designate other variants of local interest/concern as every local situation is unique, with different variants circulating, requiring surveillance and response systems to adapt to their local epidemiological situation.

If potential VOIs or VOCs are detected, Member States are requested to inform WHO through established WHO Country or Regional Office reporting channels, submit genome sequences to publicly available databases (such as GISAID), and perform field and laboratory investigations (where appropriate) to improve understanding of potential impacts.
