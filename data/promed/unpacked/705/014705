Kaohsiung's Department of Health announced on Tuesday [7 Jul 2015] this year's [2015] 1st case of Japanese encephalitis [JE] in the city. The patient, a 49 year old woman, is unable to speak and is in a semi-conscious state and undergoing treatment, the department said.

Japanese encephalitis usually becomes prevalent between May and July, during which period people should take extra care to avoid being bitten by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ or _Culex annulus_ species of mosquitoes, the Department of Health said.

The patient is a resident of Renwu District, Kaohsiung City. She first saw a doctor complaining of weakness and muscle aches on 11 Jun [2015]. Her condition soon deteriorated as she checked into the emergency room, and 4 days later, she was transferred to an intensive care ward for fever and impaired consciousness. On 2 Jul [2015], Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control confirmed that the result of her test for Japanese encephalitis [virus infection] was positive. No other cases of the disease have been found after the Department of Health investigated the potential for an epidemic.

As the patient lived in a high-risk environment near a pigeon house, Kaohsiung's Department of Health will investigate the surrounding area and carry out prevention, strengthen educational guidance to the public, and urge children to get a Japanese encephalitis vaccination. The Department of Health appealed to the public to stay alert and take preventative measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes outdoors. It warned those who experience telltale symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, vomiting or seizures to see a doctor immediately.

[The occurrence of a JE case in Taiwan is not surprising. Taiwan is well within the endemic region of Japanese encephalitis virus, which has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. Culex mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease, but there is no indication of whether the affected individual above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites.
