Sierra Leone: Outbreak of Lassa Fever in Kenema District
--------------------------------------------------------
WHO has received reports of an outbreak of Lassa fever in Kenema district.
Exact numbers of cases and deaths are not currently available. Preliminary
laboratory testing performed by the WHO Collaborating Centers, the National
Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa has confirmed Lassa fever
infection. A team from WHO headquarters and the WHO Country Office is
assessing the situation and the need to conduct further investigations,
assisting patient management in the isolation units of Kenema hospital, and
identifying measures to control the outbreak.

[Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic fever caused by Lassa virus, a
negative-strand RNA virus with a bipartite genome belonging to the family
_Arenaviridae_, that is endemic in parts of West Africa. Lassa virus
belongs to the old world group of arenaviruses. Like all arenaviruses these
viruses cause persistent infections of rodents (_Mastomys_ sp. in the case
of Lassa virus) usually without obvious signs of disease. Humans and other
animals are infected through contact with rodent excreta, particularly
urine. Cases of Lassa fever are limited to West Africa and have been
reported most frequently from Sierra Leone, and to a lesser extent from
Nigeria, Liberia, and Guinea. In endemic areas of rural West Africa
subclinical infection is common, but occasional outbreaks with high
mortality rates have been recorded. There is also risk of transmission of
disease when unrecognized Lassa fever cases are imported into non-endemic
regions for treatment of haemorrhagic disease. Kenema district is located
in the south of Sierra Leone close to the border with Liberia. Further
information on this outbreak in Kenema is awaited.- Mod.CP]
