The 1st recorded death from [a] hantavirus [infection] may have occurred in Bavaria. The suspected case has not yet been confirmed.

The bank vole is the main carrier of [Puumala] hantavirus.

The deceased man had been infected with the virus. Whether the hantavirus was the cause of death is still to be clarified, according to the reports of the Bayerischer Rundfunk, the State Office of Health and Food Safety.

In Bavaria in 2019, 224 cases of hantavirus infection have so far been reported, 107 of which were in Lower Bavaria. Last year [2018], there were 31 cases in Bavaria.

The bank vole is the main carrier of the virus. Its spread in 2019 is due to a particularly large food supply. Virus transmission to humans occurs through inhalation or through contact of injured skin with virus-contaminated dust, and through bites.

According information from the State Office of Health and Food Safety (LGL), special caution is recommended for activities in sheds, cellars, attics, and garden sheds, where mice live. In case of visible mouse infestation, gloves and masks should be worn.

Information is available from the State Office for Health and Food Securities Unit (LGL) for Hantaviruses.

[This has been an active year (2019) for hantavirus transmission and, in the recent past, in other parts of Germany as well. This year (2019), there were more than 200 registered cases in Baden-Wurttemberg (see ProMED-mail Hantavirus - Europe: Germany 20190523.6482626).

Although not stated in the report above, the hantavirus most likely involved in these cases is Puumala virus [PUUV], with the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) as the rodent reservoir host. Puumala virus is endemic to southwestern and western Germany and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS).

The above report and the earlier one comment on the abundant food supplies (beech tree mast and acorns) as contributory to abundant bank voles. In a recent comment on the Baden-Wurttemberg cases, Dr. Jan Clement comments that the illness caused by PUUV is the so-called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), with extremely variable fatality rates, depending not only on the infecting hantavirus species, but also largely on the immune response itself of the infected patient. He further commented that more PUUV-infected voles equals more human PUUV infections. PUUV prevalence in bank vole populations depends on several changing factors, resulting sometimes in denser vole populations, but with lower PUUV prevalence, hence the recent Belgian study cited below, titled: "Why hantavirus prevalence does not always increase with host density: modelling the role of host spatial behaviour and maternal antibodies."
