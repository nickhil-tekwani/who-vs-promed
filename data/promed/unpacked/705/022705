Measles cases tick up again. 30 states have seen measles cases so far this year [2019]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been 1172 measles cases in the US this year as of 1 Aug 2019, according to the latest update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The new total -- an increase of 8 cases since the tally reported last week -- represents the greatest number of measles cases in the US in a single year since 1992. Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, but public health experts have warned the country could lose its elimination status if the number of cases continues to creep up.

As of 1 Aug 2019, there had been 124 hospitalizations for measles, while 64 people reported complications like pneumonia and encephalitis, brain inflammation that can be fatal.

The Philippine health authorities have launched a massive vaccination campaign aimed at vaccinating some 2000 children against measles every day. The country suffers from a serious outbreak of this disease.

"Measles can cause serious complications," the CDC says. The agency says that out of 1000 people with measles, between 1 and 3 will die.

So far, 30 states have seen measles cases this year [2019], while Washington state; El Paso County, Texas; Los Angeles County, California; Rockland County, New York; and New York City are currently experiencing outbreaks of the highly contagious viral infection.

"More than 75% of the cases this year [2019] are linked to outbreaks in New York and New York City," the CDC says. "Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in US communities where groups of people are unvaccinated."

Multiple outbreaks in recent months are tied to international travelers who brought the virus back to the US from countries like Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, the CDC says. The New York outbreaks, meanwhile, have been concentrated largely among Orthodox Jewish communities and have prompted officials to declare public emergencies, require vaccinations in some neighborhoods and implement a ban on unvaccinated minors in Orthodox Jewish schools known as yeshivas.

Lawmakers in New York and Washington have tightened exemptions to their vaccine laws in wake of the outbreaks, while other states have weighed similar measures.

The 1st case of measles this year [2019] in San Diego County has been confirmed in an 11-month-old child who recently traveled to the Philippines. The child might have exposed others to the disease at 2 Kaiser Permanente medical facilities in recent days, the county's Health and Human Services Agency [HHSA] announced [Wed 7 Aug 2019].

The infant, who was not immunized, is in the hospital, according to the HHSA.

The HHSA is working with Kaiser Permanente to identify and follow up with patients and staff who might have been exposed at those locations to determine if they've been vaccinated and assess their potential for developing measles.

[The child was just below the age when children generally receive their 1st vaccination, that is, children should get 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, starting with the 1st dose at 12-15 months of age, and the 2nd dose at 4-6 years of age. But since the child traveled to the Philippines where measles incidence is high, it would have been wise to vaccinate prior to travel. All people traveling to countries with a high incidence of measles should check their vaccination status. - Mod.LK]

Rockland County Health officials put the total of measles cases reported since the local outbreak began in October [2018] at 290 as of 2 Aug 2019. That's an additional 7 cases in the 7 days since officials let the State of Emergency expire 25 Jul 2019, without renewing it.

At the time, County Executive Ed Day said the health department would still conduct its inspections at all schools to ensure strict compliance with vaccination requirements.

Rockland County is still on the Centers for Disease Control's active outbreak list.

The CDC reported [Mon 5 Aug 2019] that as of 1 Aug 2019, 1172 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 30 states. That represents an increase of 8 cases over the previous week. The CDC said this is the greatest number of cases reported in the US since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000.

Three-quarters of those national cases are in New York. According to the state Health Department, as of 2 Aug 2019 there had been since the outbreak started 379 confirmed cases of measles in New York state outside of New York City (290 in Rockland County, 55 in Orange County, 18 in Westchester County, 14 in Sullivan County, 1 in Suffolk County and 1 in Greene County.) As of 29 Jul 2019, there had been 642 confirmed cases in NYC since September [2018].

Rockland health officials, doctors, and clinicians have administered about 21 000 measles, mumps, and rubella vaccinations since the outbreak began. That's almost 20 times the typical number given out per year.

In 2017 and 2018 Uzbekistan received WHO certificate of measles and rubella elimination, which speaks of absence of endemic transmission of local measles cases.

An additional 100 000 doses of measles vaccines were received for vaccination of contact persons and this way to stop spread, the Ministry of Health said.

Since our last report [http://outbreaknewstoday.com/drc-measles-outbreak-surpasses-120k-cases-2000-deaths-76098/] on the measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the end of June [2019], the outbreak total has increased by some 17 000 cases.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), from 1 Jan to 21 Jul 2019, a total of 137 154 suspected measles cases including 2581 deaths (case fatality ratio 1.9%) have been reported from 455 (88%) out of 519 health zones across all 26 provinces of the DRC.

Measles vaccination coverage remains low across the DRC, contributing to the high number of susceptible individuals and fueling protracted outbreaks of measles. According to the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the estimated coverage for measles-containing vaccine 1 (MCV1) was 57% in 2018. The routine immunization program offers only a single dose of measles-containing vaccine to children at the age of 9 months.

Two of the provinces, North-Kivu and Ituri, are concomitantly affected by the ongoing Ebola outbreak. These provinces reported 1832 cases (CFR 0.5%) and 6 193 cases (CFR 1.0%) respectively since the beginning of 2019.

This outbreak is occurring in the context of a protracted humanitarian crisis, characterized by high levels of malnutrition, multiple outbreaks of epidemic-prone diseases, including the ongoing Ebola outbreak, mass displacement of populations in conflict-affected areas, and a weak health system.

[There are of 137 154 suspected measles cases reported in the DR Congo this year (2019) and we have more than 4 months to go to the end of the year. This is a consequence of so many problems in the country, including Ebola and all the other issues this population faces, as listed above. It is truly a horrific situation and definitely a humanitarian crisis that the world should rally around to do what they can to relieve the suffering of the Congolese people. - Mod.LK
