The Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine Is Said to Be Powerfully Protective in Adolescents
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is extremely effective in young adolescents, perhaps even more so than in adults, the companies reported on Wednesday -- a finding that could ease the return to normalcy for millions of American families.

No symptomatic infections were found among children aged 12 to 15 who received the vaccine in a recent clinical trial, the drug makers said; the children produced strong antibody responses and experienced no serious side effects.

Depending on regulatory approval, vaccinations could begin before the start of the next academic year for middle school and high school students, and for elementary school children not long after.

The companies announced the results in a statement that did not include detailed data from the trial, which has not yet been peer-reviewed nor published in a scientific journal. Still, the news drew praise and excitement from experts.

"Oh my god, I'm so happy to see this -- this is amazing," said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. If the vaccines's performance in adults was A-plus, the results in children were "A-plus-plus."

Vaccination efforts are accelerating throughout the nation. As of Tuesday, 29 percent of Americans had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 16 percent had been fully inoculated, according to the C.D.C.

But the country cannot hope to reach herd immunity -- the point at which immunity becomes so widespread that the coronavirus slows its crawl through the population -- without also inoculating the youngest Americans, some experts say. Children under 18 account for about 23 percent of the population in the United States.

"The sooner that we can get vaccines into as many people as possible, regardless of their age, the sooner we will be able to really feel like we're ending this pandemic for good," said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist affiliated with Georgetown University in Washington.

Data from Israel suggest that vaccinating adults alone can significantly decrease the number of cases, but "long term, to hit the herd immunity threshold, we will have to vaccinate children," she said.

The trial included 2,260 adolescents ages 12 to 15. The children received two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart -- the same amounts and schedule used for adults -- or a placebo of saltwater.

The researchers recorded 18 cases of symptomatic coronavirus infection in the placebo group, and none among the children who received the vaccine. Still, the low number of infections makes it difficult to be too specific about the vaccine's efficacy in the population at large, Dr. Rasmussen said.

"But obviously, it looks good for the vaccine if there were zero Covid cases among the vaccinated people," she added.

The adolescents who got the vaccine produced much higher levels of antibodies on average, compared with participants 16 to 25 years of age in an earlier trial. The children experienced the same minor side effects as older participants, although the companies declined to be more specific.

Dr. Iwasaki said she had expected antibody levels in adolescents to be comparable to those in young adults. "But they're getting even better levels from the vaccines," she said. "That's really incredible."

She and other experts cautioned that the vaccine might be less effective in children, and adults, against some of the variants that have begun circulating in the United States.

Pfizer and BioNTech have begun a clinical trial of the vaccine in children under 12 and started inoculations of children ages 5 to 11 just last week. Company scientists plan to start testing the vaccine next week in even younger children, ages 2 to 5, followed by trials in children ages 6 months to 2 years.

Results from that three-phase trial are expected in the second half of the year, and the companies hope to make the vaccine available for children under 12 early next year.

"We share the urgency to expand the use of our vaccine to additional populations and are encouraged by the clinical trial data from adolescents between the ages of 12 and 15," Albert Bourla, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.

Moderna has also been testing its vaccine in children. Results from a trial in adolescents ages 12 to 17 are expected in the next few weeks and in children 6 months to 12 years old in the second half of this year.

AstraZeneca started testing its vaccine in children 6 months and older last month, and Johnson & Johnson has said it will wait for results from trials in older children before testing its vaccine in children under 12.

Some parents have said they are reluctant to immunize their children because the risk posed by the virus is low. Children make up fewer than 1 percent of deaths from Covid-19, but about 2 percent of children who get the illness require hospital care.

The new results may not sway all of those parents, but they may reassure parents who have been wary of the vaccines, said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.

"While I don't think we have to wait until children are vaccinated to fully reopen schools, being able to vaccinate children may help some families feel safer about returning to school," she said.

[Once again we are receiving vaccine efficacy data by press release, and full data are not available. The small number of cases in placebo recipients limits the confidence in the data, but nonetheless suggests at least as robust a response in these older children as in adults. ProMED awaits more complete data in the form of publication or regulatory submissions.

Children clearly can become infected, frequently with minimal or no symptoms, and they can transmit SARS-CoV2, though the extent of spread and the contribution to overall community transmission has been hotly debated. With other pathogens the role of pediatric infection is clearer. For example, widespread immunization of children against pneumococcal disease led to dramatic reductions in older adults even when the adults weren't immunized. It is likely that reduction or elimination of transmission of SARS-CoV2 in children would contribute to herd immunity. Moreover, childhood immunization programs reliably achieve high rates of immunization. -Mod.LM]

[2] Brazil situation

Brazil faces health system collapse as covid-19 cases skyrocket
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Brazil is facing the biggest health system collapse in its history, according to researchers at Brazilian health institute Fiocruz, as the country records its highest number of weekly deaths since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, Chile has been forced to impose strict new lockdowns to cope with a severe second wave of infections, despite having mounted one of the world's fastest vaccine roll-outs.

Brazil recorded 18,164 deaths last week, bringing its total to more than 300,000, a higher toll than any other country except the US. Many of the country's intensive care units have reached capacity. "The lack of medication, materials and intensive care beds are turning the situation into chaos," says Renata Pieratti Bueno, a doctor who works across three hospitals in São Paulo. The shortages and a lack of trained personnel are causing unnecessary deaths, she says.

Brazil's mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2 is already high: 8 out of 10 Brazilians intubated as a result of the virus have died compared with a global average of 5 out of 10, says Fernando Bozza at Fiocruz, which
is based in Rio de Janeiro.

Information from hospital admissions suggests the virus is hitting more younger people, says Raphael Guimarães at Fiocruz. He says there has been a surprising increase in the number of 30 to 59-year-olds needing hospitalisation. "It means that the pandemic in Brazil is reaching the younger population," he says.

The P.1 variant of the virus may be to blame for the high case numbers in Brazil. Studies suggest the variant has mutations that help it evade antibodies from previous infections or from vaccination, and thus may be able to reinfect people who have already been infected.

Despite a lack of viral genetic sequencing in Brazil, the samples that have been analysed show the variant is now dominant in some regions. "We have to strongly consider that P.1 is causing the increase in the number of cases right now," says Nuno Faria at Imperial College London.

Researchers at Fiocruz have called for stricter measures, including lockdowns to reduce non-essential activity, increased use of face masks and social distancing.

However, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has consistently criticised lockdowns, saying they will hurt the poor, and has publicly referred to regional leaders who impose them as "tyrants". The president told supporters at an event in Goias on 5 March that the government regretted the deaths, but there had been "enough fussing and whining".

"The lack of medication, materials and intensive care beds are turning the situation into chaos"
The government has been slow to purchase vaccines and so far only 6.4 per cent of the population has received one dose.

Infections appear to be stabilising at a high level due to increasing interventions from states that are imposing their own strict measures, says Jesem Orellana at Fiocruz, but the delay between infection and illness means the next two to three weeks will be critical.

Meanwhile, Chile has rolled out 50.46 doses of vaccine per 100 people. Nevertheless, on 25 March, the country recorded 6196 new daily cases, and has reached almost 1 million cases in total. Around 95 per cent of intensive care beds are taken in the country.

Strict lockdown measures have been put in place from 25 March for almost all of the country. These include an evening curfew and set times for exercise. Each person is only allowed to go outside for essential activities twice a week, and must request permits to do so.

The P.1 variant and the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant, which was first seen in England, together with lots of travel during Chile's summer season have been blamed for the increase in cases.

Brazil just reached a grim COVID-19 milestone, and a reporter based in Sao Paulo doesn't see the situation improving in the near future.

"We have people dying because of lack of oxygen, people are literally suffocating," Patricia Campos Mello, a reporter for Folha de Sao Paulo, told CNBC's "The News with Shepard Smith" on Tuesday [30 Mar 2021]. "There are no medications for intubation, there are no ICU beds. It's a combination of lack of planning and just denialism of the seriousness of the disease."

"The situation is completely out of control," Campos Mello added.

Campos Mello comments came after Brazil registered on Tuesday a daily record tally of COVID deaths, recording more than 3,700 deaths, according to data from Brazil's health ministry. Brazil has the second-most COVID deaths in the world with [over 322 000], trailing only the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. On top of that, less than 2% of Brazil's population has received at least one vaccine dose.

Campos Mello noted the world can learn from the mistakes in Brazil.

[The toll of COVID in Brazil has been truly staggering, trailing only the US in overall numbers of cases and deaths. It is clear from multiple reports that the healthcare system has become overwhelmed in many parts of the country, with rationing and waiting lists for ICU beds. Not coincidentally, Brazil has largely not adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions for outbreak control or mitigation. While vaccination has begun, it appears unlikely to achieve adequate levels to reduce transmission in the near or even medium term. - Mod.LM]
