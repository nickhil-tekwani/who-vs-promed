An outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Majorca [Balearic Islands], which claimed the life of a British tourist and affected 19 other British holidaymakers has been traced to a hotel jacuzzi. Health officials on the island revealed they had identified the source in a statement in which they said they were closing their investigation.

They revealed in mid-October [2017] that a 70-year-old British man had died in hospital in the island capital Palma after going down with the illness. Regional health authority boss Maria Ramos said at the time, that they were working on trying to locate the source of the outbreak in the Brit-popular resort of Palmanova - next to the brash party resort of Magaluf - with the help of a specialist lab in Madrid. Positive samples were detected at an unnamed hotel in Palmanova where several of those affected were staying.

The hotel closed before news of the legionnaires' disease outbreak became public after its water supply was shut down. It was not immediately clear today if the Jacuzzi, part of an outdoors hotel installation, belonged to the hotel that closed down or not as officials did not name the establishment.

The regional health authority said in a statement: "From [4 Oct 2017] to [16 Nov 2017] we were informed of 27 cases of legionnaires' disease linked to a particular area of Palmanova. The people affected included 26 foreign tourists who had stayed in hotels in the resort, 20 of whom were from the UK." A spokesman added: "The tourists affected stayed in Palmanova between [13 Aug 2017] and [13 Oct 2017]. "They have all recovered, apart from the gentleman aged 70 who suffered different illnesses including diabetes, chronic leukemia and coronary heart disease. He died in hospital on [11 Oct 2017]. The investigation has concluded that the source of infection is an exterior Jacuzzi tub in one of the hotels in the Palmanova area."

Mrs. Ramos said in October [2017] the holidaymakers diagnosed with legionnaires' disease had been staying at a total of 7 hotels in the resort, making it unlikely the hotel with the most number of people affected was the source of the outbreak - or the sole source if it ended up being linked to the killer bug scare.

Since being informed of the first case on [5 Oct 2017], regional health authorities acting in conjunction with local police reacted by closing beach showers and a water fountain in Palmanova as well as water sprinklers and checking to make sure restaurants were not using the same water mist systems some were employing last in September [2017].

Although _Legionella_ bacteria was detected during the investigation at different places in Palmanova, the ones found in samples taken from people affected with the illness only coincided with those located in the unnamed hotel's jacuzzi.

A total of 15 of the people affected in the latest outbreak were men and 12 women, all aged between 46 and 87.

[The news report above says that, after having identified the source, local authorities in Mallorca have closed their investigation of an outbreak of legionnaires' disease. The outbreak involved a total of 27 people, including 26 foreign tourists who had stayed in 7 different hotels in the Palmanova resort (20 of whom were from the UK) and 1 local hotel employee. One of the British tourists died.

We are told _Legionella_ found in samples taken from people with Legionnaires' disease "coincided" with _Legionella_ isolated from an unnamed hotel's outdoor jacuzzi. We are not told how the isolates "coincided", perhaps on the basis of genotyping, or if all the cases were possibly exposed this jacuzzi. The 1st case was reported on 4 Oct 2017 and, although the exact date that this jacuzzi closed is not given, there have been no new cases reported to authorities since 16 Nov 2017.

Palmanova is a major holiday destination for Europeans, especially from Germany and the UK, on the Balearic island of Mallorca (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_Nova). A HealthMap/ProMED-mail map can be accessed at: https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=5513616,8735. - Mod.ML
