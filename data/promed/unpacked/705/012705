Two neonatal ICUs [NICU] in Porto Alegre [Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil] hospitals are closed because of a bacterium resistant to antibiotics. High-risk pregnant women are not being admitted to the Crianca da Conceicao Hospital because the NICU is contaminated by a superbug called _Klebsiella_ [ESBL? KPC? - Mod.RNA]. 3 newborns have been isolated. The delivery room, however, caters to those who have no factors that place a pregnancy at risk for complications.

About a month ago [April 2015], the same bacterium caused the closing of the NICU of the Femina Hospital, which is also part of the same hospital group as is Crianca da Conceicao; 4 patients are still infected and are being treated. The municipal health department dismisses any link between the contamination of the NICUs at the 2 hospitals. There is no provision for reopening the ICU, since the control of bacterium can take up to 2 months [? - Mod.RNA].

[The above news report fails to tell us the species of _Klebsiella_ causing the NICU outbreak, the antibiotics that the organism is resistant to, and what the resistance mechanisms are. Genotyping isolates of the _Klebsiella_ from the 2 hospitals in Porto Alegre (Crianca da Conceicao Hospital and Femina Hospital) in which nosocomial multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella_ outbreaks have occurred will help establish if any linkage is present. ProMED-mail would appreciate further details from knowledgeable sources.

_Klebsiella_ is a type of Gram-negative bacillus. _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and _Klebsiella oxytoca_ are the 2 species of this genus responsible for most human infections. _K. oxytoca_ has been implicated in neonatal bacteremia, especially among premature infants and in neonatal intensive care units. _Klebsiella_ may colonize the skin, pharynx, or gastrointestinal tract. The principal pathogenic reservoirs of infection are the gastrointestinal tract of patients, the hands of hospital personnel, and the healthcare environment. Organisms can spread rapidly, often leading to outbreaks of nosocomial infections, including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, and meningitis.

Factors that place patients at risk for _Klebsiella_ infection include prolonged hospitalization (especially in an intensive care unit), severe illness, including major surgery, compromised states (e.g., diabetes, alcoholism), antimicrobial therapy, prolonged use of invasive medical devices, and inadequate infection control practices.

_Klebsiella_ have developed multiple antimicrobial drug resistance, commonly due to production of an enzyme (carbapenemase) that destroys the class of antibiotics known as carbapenems. These _Klebsiella_ are referred to as KPC-producing organisms. Some multidrug-resistant strains have also been found to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL).

Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multi-drug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee. Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006. Atlanta, GA: US Department of Health and Human Services, CDC, Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee; 2007. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and patients (i.e., segregating colonized or infected patients and the healthcare personnel who care for them from those without multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella_ and the healthcare personnel who care for them) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0305a1_w). Additional important infection-control practices include antimicrobial stewardship and limited use of invasive devices.

Hospital da Crianca Conceicao is a pediatric hospital with 217 beds in Porto Alegre (http://www.ghc.com.br/default.asp?idMenu=unidades_hcc). Porto Alegre, with a population of 1 509 939 in 2010, is the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul in the southern region of Brazil (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre). - Mod.ML
