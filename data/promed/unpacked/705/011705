The public and doctors are being urged to remain vigilant for signs of
meningitis, following a surge in the number of deaths from the disease.
Public health officials are concerned that people may have a false sense of
security after the vaccination campaign against meningococcal meningitis
type C. This has been hugely successful, but the B strain remains a serious
threat. Health Protection Scotland (HPS) says the B strain has claimed most
of the 16 deaths so far this year [2004]. This compares to 4 deaths last year.
Health chiefs revealed that 2 of the deaths, a child under 5 and an adult,
occurred last week [3rd week of Nov 2004]. The latest figures published by
Health Protection Scotland show there have been 131 cases of meningitis in
2004 so far, compared with 159 last year. Investigations have identified no
link between any of the cases, which have included a wide range of
unrelated strains.
There has been an increase in the number of cases of meningitis due to
meningococcus type B over the past months, for which there is, so far, no
vaccine available in the UK. In 2000, 2001, and 2002, the total number of
deaths from the disease were 26, 13, and 13, respectively.
A vaccine is undergoing clinical trials in New Zealand, and HPS is
monitoring the results with a view to its introduction as soon as possible.
HPS has already written to doctors pointing out the importance of
identifying the strains they find, so the most effective antimicrobial
therapy can be swiftly administered.

2 lethal cases of meningitis in Russia (Tambov)
-----------------------------------------------
2 adolescents died from a generalized form of meningitis in the central
rayon hospital of Jerdevka (Tambov region). Officials are conducting
necessary quarantine measures to prevent the spread of infection. The
health condition of relations and classmates of victims is under the
constant observation of health professionals. The regional epidemiological
surveillance center is going to send vaccine to Jerdevka for the purposes
of prophylactic vaccination.
[Tambovskaya Oblast is situated in the central part of the Oka-Don plain.
The main rivers are of the Volga and Don basins. There is no information
about the source of infection or the type of the causal agent, but it is
probably meningococcal. - Mod.NR]

Philippine health official says meningitis-like disease not an outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
A health official in the Philippines said, on Mon 22 Nov 2004, that a
meningitis-like disease that killed 8 people is not an outbreak, despite 18
new cases recorded in Nov 2004.
Health authorities in the northern mountain resort city of Baguio, on Fri
19 Nov 2004, declared an outbreak of meningococcemia, an airborne bacterial
infection of the blood that can be spread by coughing, kissing, or other
exchanges of respiratory and throat secretions. But Dr Luningning Villa,
head of the Philippine health department's infectious disease unit, denied
that it was an outbreak and said there was no need to worry.
"We call it an unusual increase of cases," Villa said. "There's no cause
for alarm. The situation in Baguio is manageable." Villa said the "sporadic
cases come from incidental transmission." Baguio has recorded 12
meningococcemia cases, including 5 deaths, since the start of November
2004. 6 cases have been reported in Manila, including 3 deaths.

HK investigates reports of unusual occurrence of meningococcemia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection is investigating reports of an
unusual occurrence of meningococcemia, a government press release said on
Tue 23 Nov 2004.
Travelers to Baguio, the Philippines, and Filipinos returning to their
homeland, are reminded to observe good personal hygiene to avoid the
illness. Returning travelers should seek medical advice if they become ill,
and, disclose their recent travel history to their doctor, advised the
press release.
The WHO and Philippine health authorities are investigating the Baguio City
outbreak, however, no travel advice has been issued. In Hong Kong, between
3 and 14 cases of meningococcal infection were reported yearly from 2000 to
2003.

Burundi: meningitis reportedly hits southern province
-----------------------------------------------------
Since the beginning of the month of November 2004, over 10 people have
already died in Makamba Province, in southern Burundi, as a result of
meningitis. However, the numbers are provisional, because many others are
reported to have died in their homes before being able to get to the hospital.
Gilbert Njendahabona [phonetic], in Makamba, reported that the community
worst hit by meningitis is Kayogoro. There, a vaccination campaign against
the illness was organized in Oct 2004. Since the beginning of Sep 2004, the
Makamba Hospital has treated 21 cases of meningitis, but the number of
deaths caused by the disease is not yet known, because there are many
people who are dying in their homes before being able to get to hospital.
In Mabanda, 7 children and 3 adults have been reported dead since the
beginning of November 2004.
