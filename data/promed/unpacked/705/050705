The first fatal case since the surveillance system on hand-foot-mouth
disease was set up in mid-June [has occurred.
An eight-year-old girl was admitted to the Prince of Wales Hospital
shortly before midnight on Wednesday suffering from fever and vomiting.
Her condition was stable when first admitted but deteriorated rapidly and
she died seven hours later, said acting Director of Health Dr Saw
Thian-aun, who was alerted by the Hospital Authority on Thursday.
It was the first case in which the victim had shown serious complications
but was not suffering from hand- foot-mouth disease.
But this was the second case related to the Coxsackie virus, not the EV-71
virus that has swept Taiwan and killed more than 50 people. A 34-year-old
Hong Kong man who has developed severe brain and heart infections after
contracting hand-foot-mouth disease from his daughter was also believed to
have suffered from the Coxsackie virus.
Yesterday, six more children were confirmed to have been infected with the
virus, with another two new suspected cases, bringing the total numbers to
30 and three, respectively.
[It is not clear from the context whether "the virus" is a Cocksackie or
EV-71; see below - Mod.JW
A medical expert who was studying the outbreak in Malaysia and Taiwan said
the local authorities were spending too much effort on EV-71. "No one knows
[if the real culprit of the Taiwan outbreak is EV-71." Autopsies on six
children who died during the outbreak show only one death was caused by
EV-71 while the causes of the other deaths remained unknown.
