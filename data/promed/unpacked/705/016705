CHLAMYDIA LINKED TO HEART DISEASE
=================================

Cardiac contagion: is a germ to blame for America's leading cause of death?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Geoffrey Cowley writes that recent research has strengthened the case for
Chlamydia pneumoniae being involved in some cases of atherosclerosis. This
microbe is known as a cause of respiratory disease and pneumonia.
C.pneumoniae antibodies were found at a higher than expected rate in
coronary-artery disease and heart-attack patients in Finland by Pakka
Saikku & Maija Leinonen, at that time of Helsinki Center Hospital, who
published their results in 1988. They were subsequently confirmed by Dr
Thomas Grayston of the University of Washington, Seattle, USA, and research
groups in several other countries.
In 1995, Dr James Summersgill of the University of Louisville, Kentucky,
USA, isolated C.pneumoniae from the coronary arteries of a heart-transplant
patient with no history of recent respiratory illness. Animal experiments
at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada, and by the Finnish
researchers, have recently shown that infection with C.pneumoniae can
produce arterial plaques. If the microbe can be definitely linked to at
least a proportion of human heart disease, it would open the way for
antibiotic prevention and treatment. In fact, deaths from coronary heart
disease in the USA have declined since 1980, at the same time as the rise
in the use of tetracyclin & erythromycin. Is there a connection?
Moderator's note: a WHO study published in last Friday's Lancet shows that
heart disease has become the leading cause of death in the developing world,
and is projected to increase greatly in coming decades. Part of this
emerging disease may now turn out to have an infectious origin. [Mod - JW]
