Health officials say an Oklahoma resident has been diagnosed with a rare tick-borne disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that a Payne County resident tested positive for Bourbon virus. This case is the first detected in Oklahoma and only the 2nd case in the United States.

Officials with the Oklahoma State Department of Health say that since the disease is so new, more research is needed to understand the severity of Bourbon virus.

"We really don't know how significant it will be because with only 2 cases known in the United States, there are a lot of unanswered questions," said Kristie Bradley, Oklahoma epidemiologist.

Symptoms include fever, severe muscle, joint pain, fatigue, disorientation, diarrhea and a rash.

Tests ruled out all the usual suspected viruses and the CDC eventually confirmed it was Bourbon virus. At this time, there is no treatment for Bourbon virus infections since it doesn't respond the same way other viruses do to antibiotics [N.B. Viruses do not respond to antibiotics; bacteria do. - Mod.LK].

Doctors say the Oklahoma patient was given plenty of fluids and had to wait for the virus to run its course.

"Among the 2 cases of Bourbon virus, the Kansas case did die and our Oklahoma patient recovered fully," said Kristie Bradford, Oklahoma epidemiologist.

Tick-borne diseases, like Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis and tularemia, are relatively common in Oklahoma. Symptoms of those illnesses include fever, chills, headache, vomiting, rash or painful swelling of lymph nodes near the tick bite. Most of the common tick-borne diseases can be treated with antibiotics [e.g., those cited above, as well as Lyme disease].

Experts say it is important to seek medical attention if signs of illness are noticed within 14 days of a tick bite or being in an area where ticks are prevalent.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health is encouraging anyone who is hiking, camping or participating in outdoor activities to use the following tips to prevent tick bites:
- Wear light-colored clothing to make ticks easier to see and remove before attachment.
- Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants tucked into socks to deprive ticks of attachment sites.
- Wear closed-toe shoes, not sandals.
- Hikers and cyclists should stay in the center of trails to avoid grass and brush.
- Check for ticks at least once per day, particularly along waistbands, hairline and back of neck, in the armpits and groin area. Remove attached ticks as soon as possible using tweezers or fingers covered with a tissue.
- Use an insect repellent containing DEET on skin and clothing.
- Check with a veterinarian about tick control for pets.

[Bourbon virus is a newly discovered virus in the United States (genus _Thogotovirus, family _Orthomyxoviridae_). The viral genome is single-stranded, negative-sense RNA, consisting of at least 6 segments.

Bourbon virus was 1st identified in 2014 in a fatal case of a man from Bourbon County (after which it was named), Kansas, United States. The current case is the 9th report of human disease associated with a Thogotovirus globally, and the 2nd in the Western hemisphere. It
is thought to be tick-borne; while that has not yet been proven, the 1st case reported multiple tick bites prior to onset of symptoms.

Excerpted from Kosoy OI, Lambert AJ, Hawkinson DJ, Pastula DM, Goldsmith CS, Hunt DC, et al. Novel Thogotovirus species associated with febrile illness and death, United States, 2014. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015 May http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2105.150150):
The genus _Thogotovirus_ (family _Orthomyxoviridae_) contains at least 6 distinct viruses, including Araguari, Aransas Bay, Dhori, Jos, Thogoto, and Upolu viruses. These viruses have been primarily associated with either hard or soft ticks and have a wide geographic distribution. The only virus in this genus known to occur in the United States [before identification of Bourbon virus] is Aransas Bay virus, which was isolated from soft ticks (Ornithodoros spp.) collected from a seabird nest off the coast of Texas.

2 viruses in the genus _Thogotovirus_ (Thogoto and Dhori viruses) are currently known to cause human infection and disease. Antibodies against Thogoto virus have been identified in humans living in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. [see published paper for references.]

Another tick-borne virus that emerged recently in the U.S. is Heartland virus, and in China, South Korea, Japan, and Nepal, Severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus (_Bunyaviridae:Phlebovirus_). Other tick-borne viruses such as Deer tick virus / Powassan virus (_Flaviviridae: Flavivirus_) appear to be increasing in incidence in regions of the US. There is currently no specific treatment or vaccine for these viruses; supportive therapy is recommended. - Mod.LK
