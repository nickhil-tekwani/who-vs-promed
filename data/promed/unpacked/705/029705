The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a study [1] about a trichinellosis outbreak in California last year that [2017] was linked to consumption of privately raised raw boar meat. The study was published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for the week of 2 Mar 2018.

In January 2017, 12 cases of trichinellosis were reported among people who attended an event in December 2017. Larb, a traditional Loatian raw pork dish, was served. The pork came from a domesticated wild boar which was raised and slaughtered on private farm in Northern California. Leftover samples of the food revealed _Trichinella spiralis_. 9 of those patients were hospitalized with sepsis. 7 had acute kidney injury.

Trichinellosis is a parasitic infection. It used to be linked to pork in this country, back when pigs were fed garbage and scraps. Strict food standards have reduced the prevalence of trichinellosis in this country, but people who consume raw or undercooked wild game meat and pork from private sources are still at risk.

A doctor notified the Alameda County Public Health Department on 15 Jan 2017, about a patient with suspected trichinellosis. At least 3 other family members and friends were also sick with symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, myalgia, diarrhea, and vomiting. More reports of suspected trichinellosis started coming in.

Of the 29 potentially exposed people 20 were interviewed. Clinical and exposure information from all interviewees was collected and medical records for patients with a suspected diagnosis of trichinellosis were requested from hospitals and outpatient providers.

Of the 9 patients who were hospitalized, 9 had sepsis, a blood infection; 7 had acute kidney injury; and 2 had gastrointestinal bleeding. 8 patients were suspected of having skeletal muscle damage. 6 had elevated peak troponin levels, which indicate damage to the myocardium.

Investigators found larvae in an unstained touch preparation from the raw pork; they were identified as _Trichinella_. Samples were sent to the CDC and were identified as _T. spiralis_.

The event host who owns the farm where the pig was raised said that swine are only given commercial feed and never cooked meat, uncooked meat, offal, or garbage. But small animals such as chicks did get into the fenced pen and were eaten by the pigs. Small mammals infected with _Trichinella_ could have entered the pen and been consumed.

The host was educated about reducing the risk for trichinellosis by freezing raw meat for 30 days, and by cooking meat to a minimum internal temperature of 160 deg F [71 deg C] to kill the larvae. He said he would not serve raw pork from pigs from his farm in the future.

The study's authors say that while trichinellosis is rare in the United States, it is a public health threat, especially among populations that consume raw or undercooked wild game meats or pork from noncommercial sources. Home-raised and home-slaughtered swine are not subject to the same safety and inspection standards as commercially produced swine are. And home-raised swine with access to the outdoors can acquire zoonotic parasites, including toxoplasmosis and _Ascaris suum_, which is large roundworm. Educating people who raise swine for personal consumption may mitigate these risks.

[As discussed in the text pigs or wild boars exposed to the environment can become infected with _Trichinella_ spp and pass the infection to the consumer. In a situation where veterinary control of the slaughtered animal is not mandatory, health education is the only method to prevent infection with _Trichinella_ spp, in animals raised outdoors as in this case. _Trichinella_ is found in small rodents and pigs and wild boar eat dead rodents. - Mod.EP
