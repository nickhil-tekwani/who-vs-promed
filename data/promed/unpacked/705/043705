The press center of the Rostov regional office for combating animal diseases reported that brucellosis was diagnosed in 8 head of cattle in the farm Naumovski of the Budennovsky rural settlement in the Proletarian district of the Rostov region. Out of 91 sampled and tested animals, 8 samples were found positive for brucellosis.

In order to prevent the spread and to eradicate this disease, quarantine restrictions on cattle have been implemented on the territory of the farm. The removal of the restrictions and rehabilitation of livestock premises will be possible only after 2 consecutive tests of all animals, with an interval of 30 days and with negative results.

There are currently 7 locations with suspected brucellosis within the territory of the Rostov region. Earlier, it was reported that veterinary specialists of the Zavetinskiy district in the Rostov region diagnosed brucellosis in 10 head of cattle in the village of Ciccino.

[Though this is not specifically in the text of the translated report, it may be assumed that the 8 positive animals have been culled (or slaughtered?).

An earlier media report mentioned that small ruminants, held on the same farm, were suspected as being the carriers of the agent. It would be useful to obtain further information on the agent involved: _Brucella abortus_ or _B. melitensis_? The latter, which is the historical etiological cause of Malta fever in humans, is a specific pathogen of small ruminants (goats and sheep), but may readily infect in-contact cattle. In contrast to _B. abortus_, which is the specific pathogen of bovine brucellosis and a cause of abortion in this species, _B. melitensis_ is less likely to clinically affect cattle (including abortion) but will be disseminated in cattle milk and dairy products, infecting other animals and humans.

The pathogenicity of _B. melitensis_ for humans is generally regarded to be of a higher rate than the pathogenicity of _B. abortus_. - Mod.AS
