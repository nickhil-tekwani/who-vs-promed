Health authorities on both sides of the state line [Missouri and Kansas] are investigating infections among 14 Kansas City area infants with a virus that can cause meningitis, as well as widespread inflammation, serious enough to require intensive care. The condition of the infants was not immediately available, but many have had to be hospitalised. Cases began in June [2014] and were 1st reported to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) by Shawnee Mission Medical Center. Additional cases have been reported by Children's Mercy Hospital. KDHE spokeswoman Aimee Rosenow on Monday [11 Aug 2014] called the cases "a possible cluster of infections" that may, or may not, be related. "It's still pretty early on," she said. "We don't know if there's a common factor linking the cases."

Of the Kansas City area cases, 9 have been among infants who are Kansas residents, and 5 have been among Missouri residents.

The infections have been caused by HPeV3. It's one of a group of viruses, called human parechoviruses, that have emerged in recent years as an important cause of a variety of ailments in very young children. Although many human parechovirus infections are mild and have few or no symptoms, they can cause diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory illnesses. The infections are most common during the summer.

HPeV3, in particular, has been associated with central nervous infections resulting in meningitis in newborns. The virus also can cause a severe inflammatory response by the body's immune system, leading to fever, irritability, seizures and rash. None of the Kansas infants has died, but all have required hospitalization, Rosenow said. Information about the Missouri infants was not immediately available from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. Rosenow said KDHE is trying to determine whether there have been HPeV3 infections at other health care facilities. KDHE is working with the Missouri health department, Shawnee Mission Medical Center, Children's Mercy Hospital and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[The parechoviruses are a distinct genus of human and animal enteric viruses, classified in the family _Picornaviridae_. Their protein components share no more than 30 percent sequence identity with other members of the family. Human parechoviruses are occasionally associated with mild respiratory or gastrointestinal illness. Some strains can cause more severe illness, particularly in young children (see: http://www.picornaviridae.com/parechovirus/hpev/hpev.htm). Good hygiene is vital to protect against parechovirus infection. Human parechoviruses were 1st identified in 1956 and previously known as echoviruses 22 and 23. Some human parechovirus strains have been associated with more severe infections such as encephalitis and flaccid paralysis. However, human parechoviruses usually cause no symptoms at all. Children under 3 months of age are most likely to develop severe disease -- and babies can become unwell very quickly -- but most recover after a few days with supportive treatment. There is no specific treatment for parechovirus infection in general; treatment is supportive only. Since the reclassification, the number of known human parechoviruses increased and now totals at least 16 genotypes. Type 1 is known to be associated with asymptomatic infection, whereas type 3 seems to be more virulent and has been reported to be associated with sepsis-like syndrome, meningitis, encephalitis, and hepatitis in neonates and young infants. Human parechovirus infection is considered to show a seasonal pattern in temperate climates.

The role of parechoviruses as human pathogens remains uncertain. Earlier in 2010 ProMED-mail reported that human parechoviruses had been identified antigenically in isolates from 18 decedents (all human parechovirus type 1) and by RT-PCR in isolates and multiple autopsy specimens from 4 decedents with untypeable virus isolates. Sequencing of the VP1 identified these 4 human parechoviruses as type 3 and type 6. Despite the detection of human parechoviruses in decedents 3 and 4, death was considered to be from non-infectious causes (see: Parechovirus, infant deaths - USA (WI) background 20100206.0403). Further clinical and laboratory analysis will help to establish the clinical importance of the human parechoviruses. - Mod.CP
