PAU warns of fungal infection in wheat
--------------------------------------
Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has issued an advisory to farmers to keep the wheat crop safe from Karnal bunt (KB), a fungal disease known to transform wheat grains into a black mass of spores.

Dr Balwinder Singh, PAU, said samples collected from Jalandhar, Moga, Kapurthala, Mohali, and Pathankot had a high prevalence (3 to 5 per cent). Disease-inflicted seeds were more common in the samples collected in the past 2-3 years.

He said the disease was also found in seeds collected from Amritsar, Barnala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Gurdaspur, Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana, Mansa, Nawanshahar, Patiala, Tarn Taran, Sangrur, and Ropar, but the prevalence was 1-3 per cent. In southwestern districts of the state, the disease was not as prevalent.

He said wheat sown during the 2nd week of November [2015] was at present most vulnerable to infection. Dr Singh cautioned the famers to adopted suitable control measure for KB management [and said] there was urgent need to spray crops meant for seed production.

[Karnal bunt (also called Indian or partial bunt, named after the Indian city of Karnal) is caused by the fungus _Tilletia indica_. It is a serious disease of bread wheat (_Triticum aestivum_), durum wheat (_T. turgidum_), and triticale. Disease development is favoured by cool, humid conditions at time of heading. Symptoms vary with environment and are difficult to detect in the field because of the irregular distribution of infected kernels. They may include reduction in the length of ears and number of spikelets, brown blotches on kernels, premature grain drop, and stunting of plants. All or part of the grain is replaced with a powdery mass of dark spores that emits a strong, fishy odour. Grain containing more than 3 per cent bunted kernels is generally considered unfit for human consumption.

Harvesting shatters infected grains releasing the spores and leaving behind a broken, hollow shell. Spores can spread over long distances by wind and survive in the soil, on stored seed, or on contaminated equipment for up to 5 years. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread, use of clean seed, preventative foliar fungicides, and change to alternative crops not susceptible to karnal bunt (such as barley).

Economic losses are mainly due to lower grain quality, costs of quarantine measures, and loss of international trade. Consequently, most countries regulate karnal bunt as a quarantine pest. The resulting restrictions cover import of grain, agricultural machinery, feed meals, seeds, and agrochemicals that may have been handled in the same transportation system as infected wheat.

Related species cause common bunt (_T. tritici_) and dwarf bunt (_T. contraversa_) of cereals, as well as black smut of rice (_T. barclayana_).
