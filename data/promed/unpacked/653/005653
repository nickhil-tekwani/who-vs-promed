Scombroid fish poisoning is an acute illness that occurs after eating
fish containing high levels of histamine or other biogenic amines.
Symptoms typically include facial flushing, sweating, rash, a burning
or peppery taste in the mouth, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps and
usually resolve within several hours without medical intervention.
More severe symptoms (such as respiratory distress, swelling of the
tongue and throat, and blurred vision) can occur and require medical
treatment with antihistamines.
In late 2006, 2 outbreaks of scombroid fish poisoning occurred, one
in Louisiana and one in Tennessee. To determine the source of the
outbreaks and to implement control measures, CDC (US Centers for
Disease Control & Prevention) and the state health departments in
Louisiana and Tennessee conducted epidemiologic investigations, and
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted traceback
investigations of the product.
This report describes the results of those investigations, which
indicated that the outbreaks in Louisiana and Tennessee were
associated with tuna steaks from Indonesia and Viet Nam,
respectively. The majority of seafood eaten in the USA is imported.
FDA programs to identify and prevent seafood hazards such as
scombroid fish poisoning have made substantial progress but are able
to inspect only a small proportion of seafood entering the United
States. The only effective method for prevention of scombroid fish
poisoning is consistent temperature control of fish at less than 40
deg F (less than 4.4 deg C) at all times between catching and consumption.
Louisiana
---------
On 14 Dec 2006, 6 employees of an oil refinery ate at the company
cafeteria and became ill with symptoms resembling an allergic
reaction within 2 hours of eating tuna steaks. The refinery nurse
notified the Louisiana Office of Public Health, and an epidemiologic
investigation was initiated to identify the source of the outbreak
and implement control measures. [Initially,] 4 refinery employees
went to the infirmary with facial flushing and pruritic rashes on the
face, neck, and trunk, and reported heart palpitations and diarrhea
after eating tuna steak in the cafeteria. Median time from eating to
onset of symptoms was one hour (range: 15 minutes to 2 hours).
On the basis of clinical symptoms and seafood exposure, scombroid
fish poisoning was suspected, and the remaining tuna steaks were
immediately removed from the cafeteria line. A facility-wide
announcement resulted in identification of 2 additional cases. Of the
6 patients, 5 were treated with diphenhydramine and loperamide at the
refinery infirmary, and one was treated with diphenhydramine at a
local hospital emergency department.
The epidemiologic investigation indicated that 6 (26 percent) of 23
persons served tuna steaks became ill. Symptoms included diarrhea (6
persons), facial flushing (5), rapid heartbeat (5), headache (4),
rash (3), and shortness of breath (3). Other symptoms included
nausea, vomiting, sweating, burning throat, pharyngeal constriction,
peppery taste, and abdominal cramps. All symptoms resolved within 24
hours of onset.
Parish sanitarians inspected the cafeteria and found no critical
violations. Laboratory testing of tuna steaks from the cafeteria did
not detect elevated histamine levels (greater than 50 mg/100 g) (1).
The fish had been imported from Indonesia through Boston and shipped
frozen to the Louisiana distributor. During the traceback
investigation by FDA, histamine levels greater 50 mg/100 g were
detected in tuna steaks from a shipment that a local distributor had
used to supply the refinery cafeteria. Fish in the implicated
shipment had not been distributed to any other facilities, and all
remaining product was destroyed voluntarily. FDA's traceback
investigation of the tuna shipment did not detect any breaches in
temperature control, indicating that any temperature breaches likely
occurred between the time the fish was caught and the time it arrived
in Boston. Additional preventive measures included a product recall
by the distributor in Boston and an FDA import alert regarding the
Indonesian firm that supplied the tuna steaks.
Tennessee
---------
On 25 Nov 2006, 5 persons became ill after eating tuna steaks at a
restaurant. Symptoms included skin rash (2 persons), headache (2),
diarrhea (3), and abdominal cramping (3), with onset occurring 35 to
150 minutes after tuna consumption. The index patient experienced
skin rash and headache 35 minutes after eating tuna. This patient was
treated at a local emergency department with antihistamine
intravenously, which led to rapid resolution of symptoms. Illness in
the other 5 persons resolved without medical intervention. The
physician treating the index patient notified public health officials
and the restaurant, and the restaurant immediately stopped serving
the implicated fish.
County and state health officials and an FDA investigator inspected
the restaurant and determined that appropriate procedures were in
place for safe handling of fish. Credit card receipts and reservation
histories enabled identification of 14 restaurant patrons who had
ordered tuna, including the index patient; 4 additional cases of
scombroid poisoning were reported among these persons. During an FDA
traceback investigation, none of the tuna samples from the
restaurant, the restaurant distributor in Tennessee, or the wholesale
distributor in Florida contained elevated histamine levels. No
additional cases were identified by the managers of the 15 other
Tennessee restaurants that received fish with the same lot number
from the same regional distributor. The tuna implicated in this
outbreak had been part of a 23 448 pound (about 10 640 kg) shipment
from 2 processors in Viet Nam, but the traceback investigation did
not detect any breaches in temperature control for these shipments,
and no alerts were issued.

Editorial note
--------------
Scombroid fish poisoning occurs after eating fish with high levels of
accumulated histamine or other biogenic amines. Histamine is produced
and can accumulate when bacterial enzymes metabolize naturally
occurring histidine in fish. This most often occurs when fish is held
at ambient or high temperatures (such as, 70 to 90 deg F or 21.1 to
32.2 deg C) for several hours, but can occur at more moderate
temperatures (such as, greater than 45 deg F or greater than 7.2 deg
C) (2). Rapid chilling of fish immediately after catch is the most
effective measure to prevent scombroid fish poisoning. Fish from the
family _Scombridae_ (such as tuna and mackerel) contain high levels
of free histidine in muscle tissue and are the most common sources of
scombroid fish poisoning; however, other fish (such as mahi mahi,
amberjack, bluefish, abalone, and sardines) also have been implicated.
Scombroid fish poisoning accounts for less than 0.5 percent of
foodborne illnesses reported in the USA. During 1998-2002, a total of
118 scombroid fish-poisoning outbreaks involving 463 persons were
reported to CDC from state health departments (3). More cases likely
are unreported because symptoms can be short, mild, and difficult to
distinguish from symptoms of other illnesses; additionally, reporting
of individual cases is not mandatory under state or federal law.
Although elevated histamine levels have been identified in the urine
of patients in hospital settings (4), routine diagnosis is based on
clinical signs and a history of fish consumption.
The most effective prevention for scombroid fish poisoning is proper
refrigeration of fish at less than 40 deg F or less than 4.4 deg C)
at all times between catching and consumption. Sensory examination
(that is, by smell and taste) is not sufficient to detect the absence
or presence of histamine; chemical testing is required (2). Unlike
many bacterial pathogens, histamine is not destroyed when fish are
frozen or cooked, making adherence to temperature requirements along
all stages of the food supply chain essential. In these
investigations and in previously reported outbreaks (5-8), the
precise breach in refrigeration along the fish supply chain was not
identified. However, one investigation identified a potential risk
for lengthy exposure to high temperatures when using long-line
fishing methods in which caught fish might be held in the water for
up to 20 hours before being removed from the line (8).
The majority of seafood eaten in the USA is imported. In 1995, FDA
established the Seafood Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point
(HACCP) program to identify and prevent seafood-processing hazards
that can lead to foodborne illness (9). HACCP regulations extend to
importers and foreign suppliers, and FDA reports substantial progress
in implementing HACCP standards for imported seafood in the USA (9).
However, of approximately 8500 firms importing seafood into the
United States during 2002 and 2003, only 5 to 7 percent were
inspected by regulators, and FDA reports that firms handling fish
that can cause scombroid fish poisoning have particularly low rates
of compliance with HACCP regulations (9). Finally, most fishing
boats, both foreign and domestic, are not expressly covered by HACCP
regulations; instead, processors are expected to ensure that proper
procedures for handling of catch are followed onboard fishing vessels.
These 2 investigations highlight the importance of timely
communication among health-care providers, state and local health
departments, and FDA in preventing or limiting scombroid fish
poisoning outbreaks. In both of these outbreaks, health care
personnel considered scombroid fish poisoning in their initial
differential diagnoses on the basis of symptoms and exposure to
seafood. The restaurants in which the implicated seafood was served
were notified and responded by removing the implicated seafood from
the menu to prevent additional exposure and potential illness. FDA
testing detected elevated histamine levels in the Louisiana outbreak
and facilitated additional food-safety preventive measures in their
traceback responses to both outbreaks. These investigations
underscore the importance of proper temperature regulation at all
points of the fish supply chain to reduce the incidence of scombroid
fish poisoning.

[This CDC report illustrates once again the global marketplace of
food as well as the inherent difficulties in maintaining a cold chain.
It should be noted that those taking isoniazid (INH) might have more
significant reactions because of histaminase blockade in the GI
tract. An example of this can be found at Miki M, Ishiwara T,
Okayamai H: An outbreak of histamine poisoning after ingestion of the
ground saury paste in 8 patients taking isoniazid in tuberculous
ward. Internal Medicine 2005; 44: 1133-6, with its abstract below:
Patients and methods
--------------------
A total of 8 cases of histamine poisoning, which occurred in
tuberculous patients after dinner in our hospital, were analyzed by
clinical and biochemical methods. We examined the contents of 4
representative toxic polyamines, histamine, putrescine, cadaverine,
and tyramine, of the each food of the dinner and their serum
concentrations of the monoamine oxidase (MAO), one of histaminases,
using radioimmunoassay.
Results
-------
The allergy-like symptoms such as flushing, headache, palpitation,
itching, wheezing, dyspnea, and diarrhea appeared from 20 minutes to
2 hours after ingestion in those 8 patients taking isoniazid (INH),
although the other 378 inpatients had no symptoms. The histamine
content of the ground saury paste was increased to 32 mg/100 g of
food, however, the toxic level of food poisoning is less than 50
mg/100 g of food. All 8 patients were taking INH, and their serum
concentrations of MAO were decreased.
Conclusion
----------
We concluded that this accident was the histamine fish poisoning. We
speculated that those allergy-like symptoms were due to both the
increased histamine in the food made with the saury under poor
storage conditions and the patients' reduced histaminase activities
due to INH. We should perceive possible adverse effects depending on
the interactions between certain drugs and food."
The Pacific saury, _Cololabis saira_, is also a member of the family
_Scombridae_. This fish, which is a food source in some East Asian
cuisines, is also known by the name mackerel pike. A picture of the
