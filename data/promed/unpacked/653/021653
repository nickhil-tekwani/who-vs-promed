Measles outbreak affects over 250
---------------------------------
During the last 10 weeks, Gibraltar has experienced an outbreak of
measles. "We have so far been notified of over 250 cases and
notifications are still coming in at around 4-6 cases per day," said
the Gibraltar Health Authority [GHA], who believe that the actual
numbers are greater as many people with mild attacks have chosen not
to report them. While the majority of infections in the outbreak have
been mild, some have been severe and a few patients including babies
have needed intensive care.

Measles is an unpleasant disease with fever, sore throat, streaming
eyes, diarrhoea, and rash. Most people recover within a week or so,
but complications like fits, bacterial infection, or pneumonia can
develop. Long-term complications can also arise in very young
children.

Says the GHA: It is important that all persons with symptoms
suggestive of measles should report the illness to their doctor to
enable complications to be detected at an early stage. In addition to
medical advice, persons with the illness should follow general
hygiene practices such as limiting contact with other people,
carefully discarding soiled tissues, and washing their hands.

Anyone who has had measles infection is immune for life and cannot
get measles again. There is no basis for the rumour that some people
have had measles twice. It is possible that infection with rubella
(German measles, a different disease) may have caused the confusion.
Vaccination with the MMR [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine is the
only way to prevent measles infection.

[So far], the 250 cases have been in persons who are unvaccinated or
partly vaccinated (one dose only). Not a single case has occurred in
a person who has had a full course of MMR vaccine. MMR vaccine has
been available free to children [from] Gibraltar's health service
since 1989, although the boosters were only introduced in 2002. It is
also a very safe and effective vaccine, with an impressive track
record," they say. Gibraltar Health Authority adds that it is
continuing to advise all parents of children who have not had the MMR
vaccine to immunise their children. There had been some difficulties
in obtaining vaccine recently due to an international shortage, but
fresh supplies have now been received. The course consists of 2
injections, approximately 3 months apart. Please note that BOTH the
doses are needed for adequate immunity. They add: If your child has
received only one dose, either now or in the past, he or she could
still be at risk. Arrangements have been made to offer additional
vaccination to all unimmunised children as follows: During October
and November [2008], the Child Welfare Clinics (primary care centre)
will be open on Mondays (2:00 pm to 4:00 pm), Wednesdays (9:00 am to
11:00 am) and Fridays (9:00 am to 11:00 am) for immunisations.
Appointments are not necessary.

[The Rock of Gibraltar is located at the entrance of the
Mediterranean. Gibraltar is connected to Spain by a sandy isthmus, by
a ferry to Morocco, and by flights to London. By virtue of its
geographical position and political status Gibraltar is vulnerable to
introduction of infectious disease from diverse sources. No
information has been provided regarding the source of the measles
virus responsible for this outbreak. In this respect it will be
relevant to determine the genotype of the measles virus involved (see
comment in ProMED-mail "Measles - Gibraltar 20080814.2529"). The
outbreak has escalated from the 17 cases reported on 14 Aug
2008 to the current 250 cases. Despite the availability of free MMR
vaccination it is clear that there is an appreciable number of
unimmunised individuals in the community who remain susceptible to
measles virus infection. It is encouraging that efforts are underway
to expand vaccine coverage.
