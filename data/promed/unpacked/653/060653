Black cross leaf spot: an emerging threat to banana industry
------------------------------------------------------------
Black crosses on banana leaves are signs that the crop is suffering
from black cross leaf spot, a fungal disease caused by _Phyllachora
musicola_, which usually attacks cooking-type banana like cardaba or
saba. It causes fast deterioration of leaves, and significant
reduction of leaves affects photosynthetic efficiency, leading to
reduced fruit yield of up to 50 percent or more. It can also induce
premature maturation and ripening, resulting in production of poor
quality fruits.

For the past 5 years, occurrence of black cross leaf spot on cardaba
bananas was observed in banana farms in Davao del Norte. And now the
prevalence of the disease poses a threat to the province's banana
chips industry at a time when the demand for cardaba, the main
material for banana chips production, continues to increase. Black
cross leaf spot must be controlled to prevent it from affecting
banana production, otherwise the black cross could turn out to be an
indication of the banana industry's doomed state.

[Black cross leaf spot caused by the fungus _Phyllachora musicola_
affects wild and cultivated bananas (_Musa_ species and hybrids)
including many cultivars of plantain (cooking bananas) and
ladyfinger, but has not been recorded on cultivars in the Cavendish
group (for information on banana genotypes please see link below). It
has been reported from countries in Oceania and South-East Asia, but
until now was not considered a major problem in the Philippines.

Symptoms include conspicuous black crosses on the underside of older
leaves, which correspond to brown dots on the upper leaf surface. As
mentioned above, black cross can significantly reduce yield, but it
may also make the host vulnerable to secondary infections (for
example leaf spot caused by the fungus _Cordana musae_) via the leaf
lesions. The disease is favoured by high humidity and spread occurs
with contaminated materials, by mechanical means, and wind. Disease
management relies mainly on fungicide applications and cultural
methods such as wide spacing of plants and regular deleafing to
reduce moisture.
