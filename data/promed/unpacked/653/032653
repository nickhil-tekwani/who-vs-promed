New outbreaks
Outbreak 1 Butale Syndicate Crush, Francistown, North East
[district], Francistown
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Apr 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Species: cattle
Susceptible: 320
Cases: 100
Deaths: 0
Destroyed: 0
Slaughtered: 0

Affected population: the outbreak occurred in one of the 2 OIE
recognised FMD free zones without vaccination, which is composed of
zones 3c, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 18. The outbreak
occurred in zone 6 located in the eastern part of the country. The
outbreak is in a communal area located along an international border
to the east. There is a double cordon fence along the international
border and the surrounding zones to the south, west, and north. There
are about 200 000 cattle, 40 000 small stock and less than 1000 pigs.
The area is sparsely populated with wild cloven-hoofed animals.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: on 29 Apr 2011, a farmer reported 8 cattle
with drooling, lameness, and swollen interdigital tissue on all feet.
On clinical examination by the Department of Veterinary Services, the
reported cattle were observed with oral and foot vesicles and
erosions, and lameness. Cumulatively, 4 crushes (an epidemiological
unit) have been affected, all located along the international border.
The affected crushes are located in the eastern part of zone 6 in a
communal area. The communal area borders to the east with an
international border, to the west and north with farms, to the south
with zone 7 (the 2nd recognised FMD free zone without vaccination,
that remains free) and to the south west with a communal area. The
disease control cordon fences run along the boundaries of the farm,
the international border and zone 7. As a result, a containment zone
is established for the affected area. All cattle within this
containment zone will be vaccinated and supervised slaughter will
commence 30 days after the observation of the last clinical case.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection
of infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of
affected animals
Measures to be applied: stamping out; zoning; vaccination in response
to the outbreak(s)

[The animal health authorities in Botswana are to be congratulated on
early reporting and transparency. ProMED-mail will look forward to
knowing the details of FMD serotype and diagnostic results as
information on this outbreak becomes available. Early reporting
necessitated a pending serotype status.

This outbreak is much more serious than the outbreak in Ngamiland
(North West district) in March 2011 because this outbreak is located
in an FMD free zone without vaccination as control will involve an
extensive slaughter program to preserve Botswana's economically
critical export market.

The location of this outbreak next to the border with Zimbabwe can be
seen on the OIE WAHID report referenced above or via the HealthMap
website. - Mod.PC]
