With regard to your comment: "Cyanuric acid is most often used in
swimming pools to slow the breakdown of chlorination by sunlight.
Certainly this is not a product for use in food. The exact reason for
this being in the gluten products is not entirely clear;" cyanuric
acid is one of the principal products of the breakdown of melamine by
_Klebsiella_ spp. and _Pseudomonas_ spp. Cyanuric acid is also a
product of bacterial digestion of the herbicide Atrazine. It might be
wise for FDA to also be testing the protein concentrates for
bacterial contamination, as it is unlikely that the melamine would
degenerate spontaneously in the absence of bacterial enzymes.
According to Cheng, et al, cyanuric acid is further broken down to
urea (via allophanate), which is why melamine is used as a fertilizer.

Acid Metabolism. Gang Cheng, Nir Shapir, Michael J. Sadowsky and
