California hospital emergency departments are recording significant
increases in patient visits, well over 30% this year as compared to last,
due to influenza. Hospital visits are heaviest in Southern California, but
hospitals in Northern California have reported higher than normal incidence
as well.
The Los Angeles County Disease Control department has called the situation,
"The first flu epidemic in more than two decades." According to Dr.
Shirley Fannin of the CDC, it appears that a new strain of influenzavirus A
may be the [etiologic agent of much of this activity.
Influenza immunizations, widely administered in California last month,
protect patients against influenzavirus A/Wuhan, but the vaccine was not
formulated to protect against the second suspected strain, influenzavirus
A/Sydney. While speculation about two different strains of influenzavirus
A will not be confirmed for several months, if California is the starting
place for this new strain, it's likely that the rest of the country may be
in for a very wheezy, sneezy winter.
Normally, the "flu season" runs from early December through February. This
year, flu symptoms were reported as early as October, and are predicted to
continue through the end of March.
A spokesperson for California Emergency Physicians said they want to
convince people with serious symptoms to seek treatment, as "flu" symptoms
may be the initial signs of a true emergency medical condition.

Louisiana State Epidemiologist, Louise MacFarland, said there has been
widespread H3N2/Sydney for a month plus. Especially severe in New Orleans
and Baton Rouge but not to the same scale as elsewhere in the US.
