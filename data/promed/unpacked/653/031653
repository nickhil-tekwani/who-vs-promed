Efforts have begun to eradicate 3 sorts of exotic mosquito which have
been identified in Brabant and which could pose a risk to public
health. Adults and larvae of the Asian tiger mosquito [_Aedes
albopictus_], the American rock pool mosquito [probably _Aedes
(reclassified as _Ochlerotatus_) atropalpus_], and the yellow fever
mosquito [_Aedes aegypti_] have been found in used tyres imported by
several different companies in the region.

None of the insects found in the Netherlands were carrying diseases
[viruses] such as dengue, West Nile fever, and yellow fever,
according to the RIVM [Dutch National Institute for Public Health and
the Environment].

French experts, who have years of experience in eradicating alien
mosquitos, have been brought in to help eliminate the adults and
larvae using insecticides. People living and working in the affected
areas will be informed, health minister Ab Klink told MPs.

Checks on bamboo imports have been stepped up since 2006 because of
the risk of importing tiger mosquitos.

[_Aedes albopictus_ has become established in the Mediterranean coast
of Europe, and as climate change occurs, is predicted to spread
farther north (see reference below). _Ae. aegypti_ is a tropical and
subtropical species and would not be come established in the
Netherlands. _Ae. atropalpus_ is found from Labrador, Canada south to
the Florida border along the eastern seaboard of the United States,
southward in Mexico and Central America, and has been found in Italy.
All 3 species can breed in water in tires, and eggs can be
transported in them to other continents in shipments of tires.
