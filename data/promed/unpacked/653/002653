1st record of Beet necrotic yellow vein benyvirus in Morocco
In 2004/2005, during routine surveys by the regional services of the
NPPO of Morocco on sugarbeet crops, rhizomania-like symptoms were
observed on a plot of approximately 30 ha near Tadla (Beni Mellal
province) in central Morocco. Symptoms were characterized by vein
yellowing, wilting of leaves and proliferation of roots. Sample
analysis confirmed the presence of Beet necrotic yellow vein
benyvirus [BNYVV] (causing rhizomania - EPPO A2 list).
It is suspected that importation of 2nd-hand agricultural machinery
from Italy was the source of this infestation. According to the EPPO
Secretariat, this is the 1st report of rhizomania in Morocco.
Official control measures are being taken and include the use of
tolerant cultivars, distribution of information to growers, and
designation of the field as a quarantine area. Surveys are continuing
in the vicinity of the infected field.
The situation of BNYVV in Morocco is officially declared as follows:
Present, localized focus in the region of Tadla, under official
control.

[Rhizomania, "crazy root" or "root madness, is one of the most
serious diseases of sugarbeet. It can greatly reduce sugar yield and
tonnage. Further losses to producers in infested areas can result
when movement of agricultural products is restricted by quarantine
laws.
Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) is the causal agent of
rhizomania. The soilborne fungus, _Polymyxa betae_ (Pb), serves as a
vector of BNYVV by carrying the virus to healthy roots. The
association of BNYVV with Pb is an unusual biological relationship
that results in rhizomania development when a susceptible host is
present and conditions are favorable for infection. Sugar beet serves
as a host for both Pb and the virus. Although some weeds, primarily
in the goosefoot family, also serve as hosts, their role in
rhizomania development is not clear.
Data from field surveys in Wyoming and Nebraska showed that Pb is
relatively common and, when not carrying BNYVV, usually causes little
damage to the sugar beet. Because BNYVV is spread is favored by
conditions that favor both infection of sugar beet and rhizomania
development.
Pb forms 2 types of spores during its life cycle, resting spores and
motile zoospores. Clusters of tiny, thick-walled resting spores, also
called cystosori, enable Pb to survive in soil or in resting spores
for 15 years or longer in the absence of a suitable host. When soil
conditions become favorable for infection, germination of the resting
spore is triggered by the presence of a host-plant root. As resting
spores germinate, motile zoospores are released that actively swim to
the root surface where new infections occur.
Once a field becomes Pb-infested, crop rotation will not appreciably
reduce disease risk because of the long-term survival of viruliferous
cystosori. However, some soil fumigants such as those containing
1,3-dichloropropene may kill enough cystosori to reduce disease
development to acceptable levels. Fumigation treatments are very
expensive, and research is being done to determine their efficacy and
conditions under which they should be used. Expenses associated with
fumigant application may be justified, because significant sugar beet
acreage is routinely treated with 1,3-dichloropropene for nematode
control. The use of soil-applied fungicides has not been effective
for rhizomania control in infested fields.
Currently available tolerant or resistant varieties perform
satisfactorily in the presence of rhizomania in some production
areas, especially when used in combination with soil fumigation.
However, these varieties must be tested in each production area to
evaluate their performance under local environmental conditions and
production practices. They also must be evaluated for performance
after exposure to local diseases, insects, and weed pests. Research
on the development of resistant varieties is progressing rapidly,
with some having dual resistance to both rhizomania and Beet curly
top virus.
Management of rhizomania involves application of phytosanitary
measures such as containment of spread in the affected area, avoiding
movement of soil from infested areas, use of rubber boots or
disposable footwear, and cleaning and removal of adhering soil at the
field site. Moreover, soil contractors, machinery, and highway
vehicles should be removed. Removal of soil at the field site is
necessary because resting spores are extremely difficult to kill with
chemical disinfectants, especially when associated with soil.
Therefore, infested soil removed from footwear and equipment is
likely to remain infested and will serve as a potential source of
contamination.
