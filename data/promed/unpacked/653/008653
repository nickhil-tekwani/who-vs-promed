[1] Cholera, Dysentery - Tanzania (Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar)

Waterborne disease has killed one person and 202 more were taken to
hospital in Zanzibar's main town and Tanzania's capital, largely due
to a shortage of drinking water and poor sanitation services,
officials said on Fri, 10 Nov 2006.
In the capital, Dar es Salaam, one person has died from cholera and
56 others have contracted the disease, said Gastor Mwakembe,
spokesperson for the city council. He said all the cases come from
the most densely populated section of the city and that a health
education program was under way. Cholera is spread by contaminated
water and food.
In Zanzibar, an archipelago off Tanzania's coast, 146 patients have
been admitted to hospital for dysentery since 20 Oct 2006, Health and
Social Welfare Minister Sultan Mugheiry said. He added that most of
the victims were children.
The risk of waterborne disease rises twice a year, when seasonal
rains come to Tanzania. Both Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam suffer from a
shortage of clean water and an outdated sewage system, which helps
spread disease.
The annual report of the UN Development Program released Thursday
said that lack of access to clean water and basic sanitation kills
nearly 2 million young children each year. This amounted to nearly
5000 deaths per day, most of them preventable, and made diarrhoea the
2nd biggest childhood killer. The report cited Peruvian studies that
the installation of a flush toilet in the home increased by almost 60
percent the chances of a child surviving to the first birthday and in
Egypt by 57 percent.
A recent door-to-door study conducted by Zanzibar's Health Ministry
found that 90 percent of households in residential areas had no
toilets.

The news that cholera has broken out in Chiengi where 12 cases have
been recorded and Sinazongwe where 14 victims have been treated by
health authorities is undoubtedly a source of concern.
With the onset of rains, one can only hope that the requisite
measures will be put in place to ensure that the disease is checked
and no lives are unduly lost. In this regard, the measures by the
health authorities to step up monitoring of movements from the DR
Congo where the Chiengi cases are said to have emanated from, are
commendable.

The Ministry of Health has announced a cholera outbreak in Mombasa.
The Coast Provincial Medical Officer, Dr Anderson Kahindi, attributed
the outbreak to poor sanitation, which he said had been made worse by
rains that have pounded the town recently. The rains washed off water
pipes and blocked drainage systems.
Two unconfirmed deaths were reported in Magongo, Wayani area of
Changamwe constituency and 3 others in Kongowea in Kisauni
constituency.
The outbreak comes barely 2 days after Local Government minister, Mr
Musikari Kombo said Mombasa was far much dirtier than Kisumu, which
collects less revenue.
Over 10 people who sought treatment at the Tudor Health Clinic,
tested positive for cholera, 2 of them being children under 2 years
of age. Thirty people have been admitted and treated at the health
center in the past 4 days.

A total of 200 cases of acute watery diarrhea have been admitted to
Juba hospital since last week, according to an internal UNMIS note
warring international staff in the region to take the necessary
hygienic measures.
Another acute watery diarrhea outbreak is believed to be cholera in
the capital of southern Sudan, Juba. It is believed to have started
at Munuki but has rapidly spread to almost all corners of Juba, a UN
source said.
Cholera outbreak has killed at least 424 people and sickened 14 000
since January 2006 in southern Sudan, and officials are concerned the
disease could spread to other countries.
Cholera has broken out in most states of Sudan, including North and
South Darfur, but the toll does not include West Darfur where
agencies have little access due to insecurity.
The first suspected cases were reported at the end of January in Yei.
The disease was then reported in Juba, the capital of southern Sudan,
and it has spread quickly. Juba has a population of more than 250 000
people who are known to rely heavily on polluted water from the River
Nile.

Four internally displaced persons (IDPs) have so far died of cholera
in Pader district. The disease broke out in the area 2 weeks ago
after a lull of about 6 months.
Pader residents say the 1st victim was a woman who had been attending
to a patient at Kitgum Hospital. She reportedly returned home at Tyer
IDP camp after contracting the disease and died after a few days.
"We discovered late that she was suffering from cholera. Then she
died mysteriously," said a resident at Tyer, who confirmed that 2
deaths had so far been registered at the camp.
The Pader district LC5 Chairman, Mr Peter Odok, told Daily Monitor on
Wed, 1 Nov 2006, that the disease had spread to Pajule IDP camp and
Pader town council, which have so far registered one death each. He
said 4 people had so far died while 22 were suffering from the
disease in 3 different camps. "The health situation here needs
immediate intervention because the rate at which the disease is
spreading is alarming. We fear that should there be no proper
measures to control it, many people might die," Odok said.

Cholera has surged again in Guinea since the rainy season began in
June 2006, including in the capital, Conakry, where the Health
Ministry reported 626 cases so far this year.
"The latest wave is occurring because of poor sanitation during the
main rainy season and a lack of potable water," said Emmanuel Roland
Malano, who head's the government's division of epidemiological
diseases. He said 25 people have died in Conakry, including 19 who
passed away at their homes.
In the remote Forest Region in the southeast, 13 people died of
cholera in Sep 2006 in the town of Kissidougou and another 20 died in
the town of Lola, according to Mory Moussa Doukoure, a doctor at the
laboratory in Conakry's Donka Hospital, Guinea's main health facility.
In 2005, Guinea had 1956 cases of cholera between mid-Jul and early
September 2005 with 72 deaths, according to the WHO.

Authorities in Chad have tallied 1201 cases [of cholera] with 60 dead
between Jun and Oct 2006. The highest number occurred in the
southwest in the Hadjer-Lamis region where authorities confirmed 558
cases with 28 dead.
Chad's minister of public health, Ngarmbatna Carmelle Sou IV, told
reporters this week that Chadians needed to make a greater effort to
protect themselves and their environment by more frequently using
toilets and ensuring that their water supplies are protected.
Otherwise, Ngarmbatna said, "a cholera epidemic [will continue to]
make its home in our country every wet season".

The Food & Environmental Hygiene Department has ordered the temporary
closure of a fish stall in San Hui Market, Tuen Mun for thorough
disinfection following the discovery of _Vibrio cholerae_ in a water

available today confirmed the presence of _V. cholerae_ O1 El Tor
serotype Inaba.
To protect public health, the Director of Food & Environmental
Hygiene ordered the immediate closure of the fish stall. It will

Almost 300 cases of shigellosis have been reported to South Dakota
health officials in 2006. The outbreak started in May, peaked in
July and continues, health officials said in a statement to health
care providers.
In 45 percent of the South Dakota cases, the patient was 4 years old
or younger and in 11 percent of the cases, the patient was
hospitalized, the state health department said. Good hygiene, hand
washing and proper diapering are advised to prevent contracting the
disease.

At least 17 people in Fremont County, most of them on the Wind River
Indian Reservation, have come down with shigellosis, a
gastrointestinal infection caused by bacteria.
"It doesn't appear that there's any large common source of food or
water" causing the infections, said Dr. Tracy Murphy, the Wyoming
state epidemiologist. "It's being spread now through one infected
person through another."
Murphy said anyone who thinks they might be infected should avoid
going to school or work and should see a doctor. "Certainly, if they
have a gastrointestinal illness that could be shigella, we want them
to see a health care provider for their own health benefit and to
help us get a handle on controlling it," he said.
Wyoming has had 5 to 8 outbreaks of the disease in the past 5 years.
Murphy said the best way to defend against the bacteria is to
thoroughly wash your hands after using the bathroom or coming into
contact with fecal matter.
