[1] Cholera - Congo DR (Orientale)
Date: Tue 12 Apr 2011

Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN) News report [edited]
http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/2011/apr/12/drc-heavy-rains-cholera-outbreak


An outbreak of cholera that has claimed 51 lives in the eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo city of Kisangani [Orientale
province] since late February 2011 could worsen as heavy rains
threaten to undermine an emergency chlorination program, warned health
experts. The outbreak of _Vibrio cholerae_ serotype O1 Inaba has led
to the hospitalization of 913 people since it was first reported on 23
Feb 2011.

At present, the outbreak's spread is slowing: 11 new cases were
recorded on 6 Apr 2011 and the fatality rate fell from 14.4 to 5.5 per
cent over the previous 3 weeks. In mid-March 2011, 189 cases were
recorded in a single week in the city's Lubunga district.

It has also confined to Kisangani's 5 zones. Suspected cases some 125
km [78 mi] away from the city tested negative for cholera.

But the lack of a dramatic reduction in the caseload led Leen
Verhenne, who works with the Belgian branch of Medecins Sans
Frontieres, to be cautious. "This type of epidemic can stay around for
the long term and claim many victims," she told IRIN [UN Integrated
Regional Information Networks], adding that epidemiological data
suggested the principal transmission route was from person to person,
rather than via consumption of contaminated water, which generally
leads to steeper, shorter peaks in transmission rates.

Mystery still surrounds how the outbreak's patient zero, a 50 year
old woman who had never left Kisangani, became infected. 1st cases of
previous outbreaks tend to involve patients who had travelled from
cholera-endemic areas such as Katanga or the Kivu provinces.

Results of tests on 11 of Kisangani's water sources have yet to be
released. As a precautionary measure, municipal authorities
chlorinated all the city's main sources of water, distributed
purification tablets and increased public education about personal and
food hygiene.

[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Masvingo)
Date: Sun 10 Apr 2011

A senior health official told NewsDay that 3 people died last week
following a fresh outbreak of cholera in Chiredzi's Sengwe and
Chilonga areas. Masvingo provincial medical director Robert
Mudyiradima said 2 adults and a child died from over 60 cholera cases
reported in the area since last week.

"3 people have succumbed to cholera detected in Chiredzi,"
Mudyiradima said. He said the source of the resurgent outbreak was
neighboring Manicaland Province where the disease has been detected in
the last few months.

"The disease originated from Chisumbanje, which is why the areas
affected are those bordering Manicaland. As you are aware, efforts to
contain the disease in Manicaland have been underway since February
[2011]," he said.

Since February 2011, Masvingo recorded at least 20 cholera-related
deaths and 1064 cases were reported from Bikita, Mwenezi, and Zaka
districts.

[3] Cholera - Zimbabwe (Manicaland)
Date: Mon 11 Apr 2011

http://allafrica.com/stories/201104120099.html


A total of 8 people, 6 from the same family, have died of cholera
while another 8, all members of the Johanne Marange Apostolic Sect,
were hospitalized in Chimanimani [Manicaland province]

All the cases were recorded from Rusitu District of Chimanimani,
which was hit by a cholera outbreak in Mar 2011.

Director of Epidemiology and Disease Control in the Ministry of
Health and Child Welfare, Dr Portia Manangazira, said they were
continuing dialogue with members of the sect so that they can consider
accessing health care facilities. "We are still making dialogue with
members of the Marange Apostolic sect so that they can access
treatment at health care facilities," said Dr Manangazira.

She said the 16 cases from Rusitu were detected early in March 2011
but were only attended to later in the month as the sect members were
allegedly hiding the sick from members of the public.

28 districts in Manicaland, Masvingo, and Mashonaland West provinces
have been trained to deal with disease outbreaks.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Taraba)
Date: Fri 8 Apr 2011

No fewer than 24 people have died in Donga Local Council Area of
Taraba State following an outbreak of a disease suspected to be
cholera. Apart from the death toll, over 60 people are reportedly
lying critically ill in various hospitals in the council as a result
of the epidemics. The development has forced residents of the council
to take refuge in other areas of the state.

Confirming the report to The Guardian, the commissioner for health,
Mohammed Bose, however, said preventive measures have been put in
place by the state government to halt the spread of the disease.
Though he could not authenticate the type of disease ravaging the
council, the commissioner, however, said its symptoms were close to
those of cholera, which recently struck in nearby Bantaji village of
Wukari Local Council. His words: "There was an outbreak of cholera in
Bantaji village of Wukari. It was the spillover that got to Donga
Local Council."

Doctors Across Borders [Medecins sans Frontieres], according to the
commissioner, was currently on ground in the council attending to
persons suffering from the ailment. "Though it is not yet confirmed
that the disease is cholera, with the symptoms on ground, one would
believe that it is cholera," Bose added.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
(IFRC) said the situation was further exacerbated in the impoverished
Bongor region [Mayo-Kebbi Est region], "where a serious cholera
epidemic left 1500 people ill and 30 confirmed dead."

[6] Cholera - Namibia
Date: Sun 20 Mar 2011

http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/namibia-floods-displace-thousands-worms-ravage-crops/


Floods in northern Namibia have displaced thousands of people, spread
cholera and ravaged food crops, which are also being hit by
fast-breeding army worms.

With damage to roads cutting many people off from health services,
the Namibian government has declared a state of emergency and appealed
to the international community for assistance.

The worst-affected areas are Caprivi, Oshana, Omusati, Ohangwena, and
Oshikoto, aid agencies and local officials say.

The Namibian authorities and humanitarian organisations are concerned
about the spread of waterborne disease. They report an outbreak of
cholera, with 123 suspect cases, according to WHO, at least 4 of which
have been confirmed. 2 people have died.
