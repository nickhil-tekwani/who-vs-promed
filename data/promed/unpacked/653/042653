Consumers seeking to satisfy their cravings for popular raw conch dishes may wish to reconsider amid rising cases of conch poisoning. The Bahamas Agricultural Health and Food Safety Authority (BAHFSA) yesterday [27 Apr 2021] cautioned consumers to avoid eating "fresh conch" or conch that is suspected to have been improperly handled or prepared until the source of contamination can be determined.

At least 10 people with conch poisoning have been admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), according to Minister of Health Renward Wells, who said health officials were surveying the area where it is believed the contamination originated, though he did not provide further details. Many more accounts of conch poisoning have been reported to Eyewitness News. There has also been a flurry of residents taking to social media to give firsthand accounts of conch poisoning since last Friday [23 Apr 2021].

BAHFSA noted conch poisoning is commonly caused by _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, a bacterium found in the ocean that can be present on raw conch if not washed off properly with fresh, running water. "Contamination is commonly attributed to poor hygienic practices during its (conch) handling," read the statement.

Signs of infection can include watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, fever, and headache. These symptoms usually occur within 24 hours of ingesting the contaminated food, but the onset of symptoms could present within four to 96 hours and last from 1 to 7 days. According to BAHFSA, in most cases, treatment may not be necessary. It said anyone experiencing symptoms "should seek medical attention at their local clinic or nearest medical facility."

The authority stressed that reporting an illness is critical in conducting a trace-back investigation to determine the point of contamination and the pathogen responsible. "We ask that consumers assist us by reporting these events," BAHFSA said.

The BAHFSA reminded conch vendors to follow industry best practices, including proper storage of conch in flowing, and not stagnant, water; to avoid conch sitting in the sun for long periods of time upon harvesting; gutting and thoroughly rinsing conch under potable running water to remove all slime and debris; washing of hands when handling food; the use of gloves; and using separate cutting boards for vegetables and conch. It also advised consumers to watch for the implementation of these practices.

A conch poisoning outbreak in 2018, which was limited to New Providence, saw as many as 40 clinical cases of conch poisoning. At the time, the government said some of the cases originated from some vendors at Arawak Cay and the Montague Ramp, prompting the ministries of health and agriculture and marine resources to embark on an education campaign about the proper handling and cleaning of raw conch.

[_V. parahaemolyticus_ is a bacterium in the same family as those that cause cholera. It lives in brackish saltwater and causes gastrointestinal illness in humans. Symptoms include watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and fever and chills. Usually, these symptoms begin within 24 hours of exposure. Illness is usually self-limited and lasts approximately 3 days. Severe disease is rare and occurs more commonly in persons with weakened immune systems.

Infections with this organism, which can be normal microflora in seawater, have been associated with the consumption of raw, improperly cooked, or cooked and recontaminated fish and shellfish. A correlation exists between the probability of infection and warmer months of the year. Improper refrigeration of seafood contaminated with this organism will allow its proliferation, which increases the possibility of infection.

ProMED covered a large 2005 outbreak in Chile. It was impressive in its size (more than 10 000 cases), continued to spread despite early recognition, and involved clams and mussels rather than the classical oyster vehicle. - Mod.LL
