H5N1 bird flu has invaded Nigeria on at least 3 separate occasions,
the 1st genetic analysis of the virus shows. Each time, wild birds
were probably responsible, which means that its continued spread
across Africa is likely to be difficult to halt.
After spreading west across Asia, the highly pathogenic virus was
identified in Africa in February [2008], in the northern Nigerian
state of Kaduna. Outbreaks multiplied quickly, reaching Lagos in
April. Last week Taraba became the 14th of Nigeria's 36 states to
report an outbreak.
This inexorable spread has been blamed on the transport of poultry
across the country, but Claude Muller of the National Public Health
Laboratory in Luxembourg and colleagues have found that this was not
always the cause. The team took samples from infected birds at 2
farms less than 50 kilometres apart in Lagos state. The samples were
sequenced at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, and compared with gene sequences of other samples of
H5N1, including the virus from Kaduna. This revealed that the
Nigerian samples were 3 distinct strains, which were too distantly
related to have evolved from one another while in Nigeria.
"We were surprised to see such wide divergence over such a short
time," says team member Albert Osterhaus of the Erasmus Medical
Centre. Finding these 3 strains means the virus probably reached
Nigeria on separate occasions.
This does not completely rule out the possibility that H5N1 arrived
in poultry imports, as Nigerian officials and bird conservationists
have claimed. "But then you would not expect to see so many different
lineages," says Osterhaus.
The Nigerian strains were not descended from the strains of the virus
common in east Asia, despite a sizeable poultry trade between Nigeria
and China. They evolved from the strain that was first observed in
Qinghai, China, and then spread across Asia. One Lagos strain is most
closely related to H5N1 found in a buzzard in Denmark and swans in
Germany, where it is only known in wild birds. The other Lagos strain
is closest to one from Egypt, which lies on the migration route from
Siberia, while the Kaduna strain is closest to H5N1 from central Asia.
"We really have to get our act together on human and animal
surveillance," Osterhaus says. If H5N1 is repeatedly invading African
birds, it will be hard to stop its spread. Osterhaus fears people in
Africa may already have been infected as a consequence.ate: Wed 5 Jul

[The Brief Communication in Nature referred to in the New Scientist
report presents evidence from a phylogenetic analysis that H5N1 avian
influenza virus first arrived in Africa from different sources. The
Editor of Nature summarised the content as follows:
"Nigeria was the first country in Africa to report the emergence of
H5N1 bird flu in February 2006. The country is particularly at risk
because chickens are imported from all over the world without
rigorous biosecurity safeguards, and there are many bird sanctuaries
along the migration routes linking Nigeria to southern Russia and
western Asia. An analysis of DNA sequences in H5N1 [viruses] from
infected poultry in Lagos state now points to wild birds as the
likely source. Three H5N1 lineages seem to have been introduced
independently by migratory birds, though independent trade imports
cannot be excluded."

The authors have analysed H5N1 sequences in poultry from 2 different
farms in Lagos state and find that 3 H5N1 lineages were independently
introduced through routes that coincide with the flight paths of
migratory birds, although independent trade imports cannot be
excluded.
The substance of the paper is that the presence of H5N1 avian
influenza virus in Africa was first reported in commercial poultry
farms in Kaduna state in northern Nigeria on 7 Feb 2006. The poultry
farming industry is 2nd in importance only to oil production in
Nigeria and is particularly vulnerable to the introduction of
infectious agents because chickens are imported from all over the
world without rigorous biosecurity safeguards. This vulnerability is
increased because the country has many bird sanctuaries along the 2
flight paths that link Nigeria with the southern Russian region and
Europe, and with western Asia. However, a sero-epidemiological study
conducted in Nigeria of 65 flocks in the southwestern states (the hub
of the Nigerian poultry industry) showed no evidence of avian
influenza in poultry up to the time the study was terminated in May
2004.
The authors recovered virus isolates that tested positive in a
generic test for influenza A from 18 cloacal swabs taken from poultry
from 2 farms in Lagos state in the far southwest of the country.
Sequencing of these isolates confirmed the presence of H5N1 virus.
The viral haemagglutinin cleavage-site sequence PQGERRRKKRG was
identical to that of the highly pathogenic strains already found in
Europe, Russia and central Asia.
A phylogenetic analysis of complete haemagglutinin gene sequences
group together with those of the 2005-06 H5N1 strains from western
Asia (Mongolia; Qinghai in China; Crimea in the Ukraine; Kurgan,
Astrakhan and Novosibirsk in Russia; Iran; Iraq), Europe (Turkey;
Croatia; France; Italy; Germany) and Africa (Egypt).
The percentage variation in nucleotide sequence between the strains
from the 2 Lagos state farms in the southwest and DQ406728, a strain
from northern Nigeria, was 0.79, 0.87 and 1.14 percent, respectively.
The complete haemagglutinin sequences from the other farm and
northern Nigerian isolates resembled most closely the
A/Cygnusolor/Astrakhan/Ast05-2/2005, A/chicken/Egypt/960N3-004/2006
and A/chicken/Kurgan/3/2005 strains, respectively.
The authors conclude that the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
strains in northern Nigeria and in Lagos state belong to 3 distinct
genetic lineages and were therefore probably introduced
independently. Their sequence data rule out a southeast-Asian origin
for these different lineages. The H5N1 virus has reached 14 of the 31
federal states of Nigeria and it is difficult to see how the virus
might still be contained without depopulation measures, combined with
surveillance and large-scale vaccination. - Mod.CP]
