About 25 people were hospitalized Wednesday afternoon, 10 Dec 2014, after a case of foodborne illness at an office holiday party in Maitland, Florida, officials said. Orange County Fire Rescue officials responded to the Maitland Colinades after at least 50 people became violently ill around 2:30 pm. About 25 people were transported to nearby hospitals in Orange and Seminole counties. Officials said the additional victims either did not go to the hospital or took themselves to the hospital.

Officials said an unknown caterer provided the food around 12:30 pm. for an office holiday party in the Maitland Colinades. It is unclear how many people attended the party. About 700 people work in the building.

The incident was categorized as a mass causality incident because of the number of victims. Rescue officials from Maitland, Orange County, Winter Park, and rural metro responded. The FBI and Homeland Security were notified as a precaution, officials said.

Some people became so sick they passed out, workers said.

[With an incubation period of as short as 2 hours, the possible etiology of the illness here is quite limited. Although the symptoms that the party guests manifested are not stated, it is overwhelmingly likely that they suffered from vomiting as opposed to diarrhea and the illness was not associated with fever.

It is likely that laboratory testing will show a food item to be contaminated with high levels of _Staphylococcus aureus_. Food can become contaminated if a person with a staph infection has an uncovered lesion or sore that comes in contact with food or food processing equipment. _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteria and toxin can contaminate foods or equipment. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are fast acting, sometimes causing illness in as little as 30 minutes but usually in 4-6 hours, with nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and little if any fever. The patients usually recover within a day.

A very short incubation of a vomiting-associated illness (less than 1 hour) suggests that the etiology was heavy metal ingestion. A number of metals can cause this type of syndrome, which is usually caused by the ingestion of a liquid that had been kept in a metallic container. These metals include antimony, copper, tin, and zinc. The illnesses are usually self-limiting and require only symptomatic care. In addition to vomiting, other clues may include the liquid being described as having a metallic taste. Identifying the specific cause requires analysis of the food or liquid vehicle. Some potential differences in the illnesses exist between causes include a longer incubation period (several hours) for zinc, vomiting and diarrhea for tin, and blue or green vomitus for copper. - Mod.LL
