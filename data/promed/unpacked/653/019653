Abstract
--------
We describe a case of monkeypox in a traveler who returned from the United Kingdom to the United States who did not report recent sexual contact.

A man in his 20s sought care at an emergency department in Stanford, California, USA, on day 7 of an asynchronous, diffuse vesicular rash following travel to the United Kingdom. The 1st lesion appeared â‰ˆ14 days after he attended a large, crowded outdoor event at which he had close contact with others, including close dancing, for a few hours. He said that many attendees were in sleeveless tops and shorts. He wore pants and a short-sleeved top. He did not notice any skin lesions on anyone present, nor did he notice anyone who seemed sick. He shared an e-cigarette with a woman that he met while there. The event was not a rave and was not attended specifically or mostly by persons identifying as gay or bisexual. He attended other similar outdoor events over 4 days. He reported consuming alcohol but no other drug use at these events. He did not wear a mask at these events. He had contact with domestic dogs that he petted.

He took 2 flights to return to the United States; masks were worn on one flight. He identifies as bisexual but reported no recent sexual contacts during his travels or in the preceding 3 months. He reported no close indoor activities, although he traveled on crowded public trains. He reported no close contacts since his return. He lives with 1 roommate who did not manifest any symptoms. He had a history of syphilis treated 3 months earlier and was taking HIV preexposure prophylaxis. He denied preceding fevers, chills, headache, lymph node swelling, cough, fatigue, or anorectal pain.

We noted multiple nondraining skin lesions at different stages of appearance, including a centrally umbilicated vesicle on his left palm, a crusting flat lesion on his lip, and pustules on his right and left knuckles and on his lateral torso and back. He had no penile, testicular, or anal lesions and no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Results of complete blood count and basic metabolic panel results were unremarkable. Results of rapid HIV-1 antibody/antigen test were negative, as was urine testing for _N. gonorrhoeae_ and _C. trachomatis_. Rapid plasma regain test results were positive (titer of 1:1). The palmar vesicle was unroofed; a swab of the expressed clear fluid tested positive for nonvariola orthopoxvirus DNA by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and was confirmed as monkeypox virus DNA by qPCR specific for clade 2/3 (West Africa) monkeypox (Table; Appendix). A nasopharyngeal swab specimen that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 was positive for monkeypox virus DNA using this 2-step testing algorithm. We did not prescribe specific monkeypox treatment because the patient did not have complications or risk factors for severe disease.

We performed follow-up monkeypox virus testing with patient consent 3 days after initial evaluation (day 10 after symptom onset) to clarify viral shedding. We detected virus DNA in a saliva sample, as well as from patient-collected conjunctival and rectal swabs using both the non-variola orthopoxvirus and clade 2/3 monkeypox virus qPCRs. Lesions resolved by day 26 after symptom onset.

This patient tested positive for monkeypox virus DNA from several non lesion samples. The nasopharyngeal and saliva findings are noteworthy because the patient did not report respiratory symptoms. In addition, the detectable viral DNA in the rectal swab specimen in the absence of visible anal lesions or pain indicates a potential for sustained sexual transmission, although the viral DNA levels were low; contamination during self-collection cannot be ruled out. We were unable to assess whether internal rectal lesions were present.

This case highlighted the distinctiveness of clinical manifestations as they indicated potential routes of transmission during the 2022 multicountry outbreak of monkeypox. This patient did not report recent sexual contact, did not have evidence of genital lesions or inguinal lymphadenopathy, and did not report a viral prodrome. His primary risk factor was close, nonsexual contact with numerous unknown persons at a crowded outdoor event. His case highlights the potential for spread at such gatherings, which may have implications for epidemic control. The lack of both sexual exposure and anogenital involvement indicates that mode of transmission may be associated with clinical symptoms; fomites (hotel bedding and sheets, high-touch areas in public settings) may be alternative modes of transmission. Overall, the viral inoculum required for all possible modes of transmission remains an area of active investigation.

This case also demonstrates the importance of local monkeypox virus testing, rather than centralized testing in public health or commercial reference laboratories. Local testing enabled diagnosis in <12 hours and immediate notification to local and state public health authorities for isolation and contact tracing.

Cases of monkeypox have been detected so far in 7 of the 24 Ecuadorian provinces, with the highest incidence found in Guayas, Los Rios, and El Oro in the coastal region.

Of the 6 new confirmed cases, 2 were found in children with one being a 9-year-old who came from abroad and developed the infection in Ecuador, said the Ecuadoran health official.

"This shows that the disease can occur at any age," Perez said, noting that in Ecuador the infections were initially found mostly in men aged 20-40.

Among the confirmed cases, a patient died on Monday [8 Aug 2022] due to a "pre-existing pathology."

Meanwhile, 35 people are currently under surveillance for the infection.

The 1st case of this zoonotic disease was confirmed in Ecuador on 6 Jul 2022 in a 30-year-old man in the city of Guayaquil, capital of the southwestern province of Guayas.

Bolivia has confirmed a total of 15 monkeypox cases, all in the eastern city of Santa Cruz, Minister of Health and Sports Jeyson Auza said on Monday [15 Aug 2022].

All the cases involve men between the ages of 22 and 43, and all are in stable condition and under medical supervision, Auza said at a press conference.

"There are 71 suspected cases who were registered in the country and 15 were confirmed," he said. "In addition, there are 30 people under observation who had direct contact with the positive cases."

According to the official, 11 cases were contracted in Santa Cruz, while 3 were contracted in Brazil and one in Chile.

In view of Bolivia's gradual rise in monkeypox cases, Auza announced adjustments to the country's epidemiological surveillance to prevent a larger outbreak.

Bolivia confirmed its 1st case of monkeypox on 1 Aug [2022] in a 38-year-old man.

British health officials say the monkeypox outbreak across the country "shows signs of slowing" but that it's still too soon to know if the decline will be maintained.

In a statement on Monday [15 Aug 2022], the [UK Government] Health Security Agency said authorities are reporting about 29 new monkeypox infections every day, compared to about 52 cases a day during the last week in June [2022]. In July [2022], officials estimated the outbreak was doubling in size about every 2 weeks. To date, the U.K. has recorded more than 3000 cases of monkeypox, with more than 70% of cases in London.

The agency also said more than 27 000 people were immunized with a vaccine designed against smallpox, a related disease.

"These thousands of vaccines, administered by the (National Health Service) to those at highest risk of exposure, should have a significant impact on the transmission of the virus," the agency said. It said the vast majority of cases were in men who are gay, bisexual, or have sex with other men and that vaccines were being prioritized for them and for their closest contacts and health workers.

Last month [July 2022], Britain downgraded its assessment of the monkeypox outbreak after seeing no signs of sustained monkeypox transmission beyond the sexual networks of men who have sex with men; 99% of infections in the U.K. are in men.

British authorities said they bought 150 000 doses of vaccine made by Bavarian Nordic, the world's only supplier. The 1st 50 000 doses have already been rolled out or will be shared soon with clinics across the country and the next 100 000 vaccines are expected to be delivered in September [2022].

Monkeypox spreads when people have close, physical contact with an infected person's lesions, their clothing, or bedsheets. Most people recover without needing treatment, but the lesions can be extremely painful, and more severe cases can result in complications including brain inflammation and death.

Globally, there have been more than 31 000 cases of monkeypox reported in nearly 90 countries. Last month [July 2022], the World Health Organization declared the outbreak to be a global emergency and American officials have classified their epidemic as a national emergency.

Outside of Africa, 98% of cases are in men who have sex with men. With only a limited global supply of vaccines, authorities are racing to stop monkeypox before it becomes entrenched as a new disease.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
As of 11 Jul 2022, 503 confirmed cases of monkeypox are reported in the Netherlands. Monkeypox virus likely ends up in wastewater because i) skin flakes from areas affected by the typical rash and scabbing may wash off, and ii) monkeypox virus has been detected in animal and human feces. Here we describe a method to qualitatively detect monkeypox virus DNA in wastewater, that may prove a valuable surveillance tool for outbreaks.

[8] Potentially susceptible European mammals

ref: Blagrove MSC, Pilgrim J, Kotsiri A, et al. Monkeypox virus shows potential to infect a diverse range of native animal species across Europe, indicating high risk of becoming endemic in the region. bioRxiv 2022.08.13.503846
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
Monkeypox is a zoonotic virus which persists in animal reservoirs and periodically spills over into humans, causing outbreaks. During the current 2022 outbreak, monkeypox virus has persisted via human-human transmission, across all major continents and for longer than any previous record. This unprecedented spread creates the potential for the virus to "spillback" into local susceptible animal populations. Persistent transmission amongst such animals raises the prospect of monkeypox virus becoming enzootic in new regions. However, the full and specific range of potential animal hosts and reservoirs of monkeypox remains unknown, especially in newly at-risk non-endemic areas.

Methods
Here, utilising ensembles of classifiers comprising different class balancing techniques and incorporating instance weights, we identify which animal species are potentially susceptible to monkeypox virus. Subsequently, we generate spatial distribution maps to highlight high-risk geographic areas at high resolution.

Findings
We show that the number of potentially susceptible species is currently underestimated by 2.4 to 4.3-fold and that a high density of wild susceptible species is native to Europe. We provide lists of these species and highlight high-risk hosts for spillback and potential long-term reservoirs, which may enable monkeypox virus to become endemic.

Interpretation
We highlight the European red fox and brown rat, as they have established interactions with potentially contaminated urban waste and sewage, which provides a mechanism for potential spillback. We anticipate that our results will enable targeted active surveillance of potential spillback events, to minimise the risk of the virus becoming endemic in these regions. Our results also indicate the potential of domesticated cats and dogs (latter now confirmed) being susceptible to monkeypox virus, and hence support many health organisations' advice for infected humans to avoid physical interaction with pets.

[Now that a number of wild mammals that might be at risk of spillback have been identified, the next essential step is to determine if, in fact, they are susceptible through experimental exposure to monkeypox virus. If they are susceptible, in order to become monkeypox virus reservoirs in nature, their numbers and behaviors would have to be such that chains of ongoing transmission would occur. - Mod.TY]
