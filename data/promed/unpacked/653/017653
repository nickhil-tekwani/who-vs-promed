For the past week, 334 persons came for aid to medical establishments
of the republic in connection with tick bites. In all, since the
beginning of the epidemiological season, 2056 persons including 610
children have suffered from tick bites. It is 1.4 fold more than in
the corresponding period of last year [2008].

The highest rate of tick attacks has been observed in nearby
Sayanogorsk, in the forest zone of the Tashtypsky, Shirinsky, Beysky,
Bogradsky, Askizsky districts, and in the bordering districts of the
Krasnoyarsky region. The most unfavorable situation is in the village
of Cheremusky and nearby, in the summer residence districts of
Sayanogorsk, where every week 100-130 victims of tick bites are
recorded.

Epidemiologists indicated that among tick [bite] victims who came for
medical assistance not more than 20 percent are vaccinated against
TBE [virus]. As result the majority of [tick bite] victims are at
risk of infection. Tick-borne encephalitis has been confirmed in 17
inhabitants of the republic; 3 cases have been recorded in each of
the Shirinsky and Tashtypsky districts, 2 cases in each of Abakan,
Sayanogorsk, Abaz cities, and Askizsky districts. Also, 18 persons,
including 2 children, contracted Lyme disease; in 2008 it was 10
persons. The carriers of this infection are also taiga ticks.

Over the last week anti-tick activities in territories has been
carried out at the health-care units in the Shirinsky, Bogradsky and
Beysky districts.
