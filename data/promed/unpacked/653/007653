Birds culled in rare salmonella outbreak
----------------------------------------
A total of 125 000 birds were culled in a cage unit run by Ready Egg Products in Fermanagh when the owner, Charles Crawford, received confirmation of an outbreak of gallinarum -- a rare strain of salmonella which is believed to pose little risk to humans. The outbreak was officially confirmed by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). It said in a statement, "DARD is aware of an outbreak of _Salmonella gallinarum_ at an egg production unit in Fermanagh. This type of salmonella is non-notifiable and the control of the disease is a matter for the company.

"On this occasion the department assisted the company with depopulation.

This was done efficiently and has resulted in a humane and rapid depopulation of the affected house, which was one of 3 on the site. This outbreak is unusual in 2 ways, firstly isolation of _Salmonella gallinarum_ is rare in the UK and secondly in this form it is more commonly a disease of backyard flocks rather than commercial ones. _Salmonella gallinarum_ is a poultry adapted strain of salmonella bacteria and is considered to pose a minimal risk to humans."

Charles Crawford told the Ranger that he had no idea where the infection had come from and he said that experts he had asked did not seem too sure, either. One had told him that the strain was associated with backyard flocks; another said it wasn't. He said it was not easy to find anyone with any detailed knowledge of _Salmonella gallinarum_. "I found it quite difficult to find an authority on the subject, although I am told there is no danger to human health," said Charles. "The vets only seemed to know what they read in a book."

Charles said that although _Salmonella gallinarum_ was non-notifiable he had made his own decision to cull the affected flock. "I have a responsibility to my own flock and to the rest of the industry," said Charles, who is a member of Lion. He said that how the industry and government should respond to such outbreaks would probably be discussed with other producers and with government officials because most poultry keepers would never have come across an outbreak of _Salmonella gallinarum_.

The cull has accounted for one 3rd of Charles Crawford's cage production. He had a total of 375 000 birds in 3 units on the farm. The culled birds are expected to be replaced in January [2013] once the affected unit has undergone an intensive programme of cleaning to ensure it is clear. Charles also has 250 000 free range layers on a different site.

Charles said he believed there had been one other outbreak of _Salmonella gallinarum_ in the United Kingdom in recent years. In his case, he became aware that something was wrong when birds started dying. The presence of _Salmonella gallinarum_ was established subsequently through testing.

[_Salmonella gallinarum_ infection in poultry, also called 'fowl typhoid,' is an OIE-listed disease. The European Union (EU) and some 3rd-country trade in live poultry may take place only from flocks with specified monitoring programmes for _S. gallinarum_ (and _S. pullorum_); a specific health scheme for these pathogens is maintained. In its most recent annual report to the OIE (2011), UK reported that fowl typhoid, a non-notifiable disease, was not recorded during 2011 while its last date of occurrence is given as "unknown." However, DEFRA's (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) document "Summary profile for salmonellosis" (undated; see at http://tinyurl.com/cwfyko5) says: "_S gallinarum_ was thought to be absent, but there have been 2 recent isolates from poultry."

The following information is based upon OIE's Terrestrial Manual 2012 (chapter 2.3.11 "Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease;" version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012):

"Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S. gallinarum biovar Gallinarum_ and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterised by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

"Clinical signs in chicks and poults include anorexia, diarrhoea, dehydration, weakness and death. In mature birds Pullorum disease is less severe but decreased egg production, poor hatchability and some increased mortality may occur. Fowl typhoid is a more acute septicaemic condition which mainly affects mature birds and may be particularly severe in commercial laying flocks."

The use of vaccines to control _S. gallinarum_ infections in chickens may cause problems in the interpretation of serological results. It is not allowed in many countries. - Mod.AS
