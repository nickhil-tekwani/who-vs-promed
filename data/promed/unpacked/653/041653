Growers warned on stem rust
---------------------------
Victorian farmers are facing the worst stem rust outbreak in over a decade,
with susceptible wheat crops infected right across the state in a late
season outbreak of the fungal disease.

Grant Hollaway, Department of Primary Industries (DPI), said there had been
reports of infection from the Mallee right down to the Western District.
"There's 3 main factors, the wet summer which allowed a green bridge to
survive, the wet growing season conducive to the spread, and the widespread
planting of susceptible varieties."

Dr Hollaway said in the Mallee, the major concern would be quality, while
in the Western District, where some crops are still flowering, there is the
potential for the disease to hit yields. However, he said with constant
crop monitoring and fast action, growers could limit damage. He said he
thought the emergence of the disease would cut the plantings of susceptible
varieties. "This outbreak may prompt growers to switch [varieties]."

Consultant Harm van Rees said the emergence of the disease was of relevance
in the Mallee. He said growers had found the disease in paddocks where the
crop had already been treated with low rates of fungicides.

[Wheat stem rust (also called black rust) is caused by the fungus _Puccinia
graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Yield losses of up to 70 per cent are reported,
but some fields are totally destroyed. If stem rust arrives early in the
growing cycle, losses are higher.

Spores are spread by wind and with infected straw, but the fungus needs
living tissue to survive between seasons. Volunteer wheat plants and some
grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next
season and are therefore often a source of infection for a new crop.
Disease management may include crop monitoring and timely fungicide
applications, control of volunteer wheat, and use of resistant varieties.

New stem rust strains are emerging. The most dangerous at present is the
Ug99 group of strains which have overcome the major resistance genes used
in our current wheat varieties. However, none of the Ug99 strains are at
this time present in Australia.
