Methanol poisoning, Kenya
---------------------------
The methanol poisoning in Machakos District in the Eastern Province
of Kenya has killed 48 people as of 27 Jun 2005. Admissions of cases
to Machakos Hospital began on 24 Jun 2005. Many cases died at home
and others died in the hospital. The cause of the poisoning was
illicit brew laced with methanol to give a "kick." The drink is
popularly known as "Mulika" in the area. It is feared that the
illicit brew may also have been distributed in the neighboring
districts of Kitui and Makueni. 160 cases of methanol poisoning were
seen at the Machackos Hospital, and 48 cases were admitted. Many of
the patients died in the hospital, and others died at home. About 10
patients are blind.

The largest outbreak of methanol poisoning in Kenya occurred in the
year 2000, when over 100 people died after consuming an illicit brew
laced with methanol. The illicit brew was called "Kumi Kumi," since
it was sold for 10 Kenya shillings (USD 1 = 75 Kenya shillings).

Most patients who came to the hospital presented with abdominal pain,
vomiting, severe headaches, dizziness and confusion. Most of the
patients came late to the hospital, and many of the deaths occurred
outside the hospital.

Contaminated alcohol kills 48 near Nairobi
-----------------------------------------------
At least 48 people had died by Monday [27 Jun 2005] after drinking
contaminated alcohol which was sold by local traders in Kenya's
Machakos district, southeast of Nairobi, medical and police officials
said.

Another 84 people had been treated in the hospital for suspected
methanol poisoning, the medical superintendent of the Machakos
district hospital, Simon Mueke, said. 22 of those being treated were
in serious condition.

3 people had lost their eyesight, while another 5 had developed "eye
complications," Mueke said. Most of the deaths, he added, had
occurred on Friday and Saturday [24/25 Jun 2005].

Methanol, a highly toxic alcohol commonly used as an industrial
solvent, is believed to have been added to a home-distilled gin,
apparently in an attempt to make it more potent, according to Mueke.

Permanent or partial blindness in methanol-poisoning, he added,
results from retinal damage caused by intra-retinal metabolism of
methanol and the accumulation of formic acid. Inhibition of normal
metabolism in the optic nerve cells due to the presence of methanol
could also lead to blindness, he said. "Death is in most cases the
result of liver or kidney failure," Mueke said.

He said doctors were using conventional ethanol, including vodka, to
treat the methanol poisoning cases, because ordinary alcohol
inhibited methanol metabolism in the body and enhanced the
elimination of the toxic un-metabolized poisonous compounds.

"We have been using vodka, because it displaces methanol from the
receptors in the blood," Mueke said. Those who were very sick, he
added, were being asked to take sips of vodka.

A police spokesman said they had arrested 4 people, including a woman
bootlegger said to have supplied the killer drink. Some 105 liters of
the drink had been seized, and samples would be taken to the
government chemists for analysis to establish what exactly the
alcohol was laced with.

Adulteration of home-made alcoholic drinks with industrial chemicals
has become a common problem in Kenya during the past few years.

More than 130 people died in a slum in Nairobi in 2000 after
consuming contaminated liquor.

In 1998, the government banned several locally distilled low-priced
liquors, but the consumption of "chang'aa" -- a popular gin distilled
from fermented maize meal or sorghum -- remained widespread despite
frequent police raids on suspected distillers.

Kenya's internal security minister, John Michuki, told reporters the
woman who supplied the drink was a "well known peddler who has been
arrested on numerous occasions, but the law has not been able to
convict her."
