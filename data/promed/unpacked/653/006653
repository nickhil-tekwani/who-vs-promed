As of Tuesday morning, 15 Dec 1998, CDC had not received any official
word on the outbreak reported by the Chinese news agency Xinhua to be
plague & to have caused more than 600 cases of illness.
Unofficial sources inform ProMED-mail that there have been no cases
of plague this year in Kazakhstan, but that an outbreak of about 1000
cases of leptospirosis has occurred. This is, the sources say,
somewhat surprising since, although leptospirosis occurs everywhere
except in the polar regions, the affected area is in northern
Kazakhstan and it is winter there.
One could imagine that the error in the original report stemmed from
a Chinese news agency staffer translating the phrase "disease due to
a plague of rats" (leptospirosis increases in proportion to rat
populations) from the Russian into English as simply "plague."
