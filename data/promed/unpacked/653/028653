Sudden death seen in 5 per cent of Brazil's Sao Paulo orange crop
-----------------------------------------------------------------
SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 19 (Reuters): Citrus sudden death (MSC), a disease
plaguing Brazil's Sao Paulo state, should affect only a small percentage of
its orange orchards, a Sao Paulo state official said on Wednesday. Marcos
Antonio Machado, president of the citrus department at Sao Paulo's
agriculture department, said the potent disease, which infects citrus trees
based on Rangpur lime as rootstock, would only affect a northern region of
Sao Paulo that produces about 5 per cent of the state's crop. Sao Paulo
accounts for about 85 percent of Brazil's orange production.
Machado, a director of research at Apta Citros, a research organization
that studies citrus diseases in Sao Paulo, doubted that production would be
affected. The state's Agricultural Economy Institute (IEA), which is linked
to the agriculture secretary, said the state should produce 362.7 million
40.8 kilogram boxes from the 2003/04 (July-June) crop. The affected area
produces about 13 million boxes.
Apta Citros researchers are also investigating the possible spread of
_Alternaria alternata_ [Aa] a fungus that causes citrus brown spot disease
(CBSD) in tangerine trees in Sao Paulo state. The disease was reported in
neighboring states last month. Aa does not attack orange trees. Machado
said that Aa has already affected orchards in Florida in the United States
and was being fought by application of fungicides, adding that control is
costly and discouraging to producers.

[This report is a follow up on the previous post. Citrus sudden death is a
factor in Brazil's orange production but perhaps not a major one. Citrus
brown spot disease (CBSD; also known as black rot, Alternaria fruit rot) is
primarily a disease of fruit in storage but leaves can be heavily infected.
Yield losses can be substantial because of spoilage. CBSD is caused by a
complex of pathotypes based on host specificity of the pathogen and toxin
production. The "rough lemon pathotype" infects only rough lemon (_Citrus
jambhiri_) and the "tangerine pathotype" infects only tangerines (_C.
reticulata_) and tangerine x grapefruit (_C. paradisi_) hybrids. The
disease was first observed on citrus in Florida in 1974 and has since been
reported in Israel, South Africa, Colombia, Turkey and Spain. - Mod.DH]
