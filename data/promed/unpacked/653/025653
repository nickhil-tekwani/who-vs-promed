MALARIA VACCINE, TRANSGENIC PROTEIN

Genzyme Transgenics Corporation announced 13 January that it has achieved
high-level expression of a malaria antigen in the milk of transgenic mice.
The antigen was expressed as part of Genzyme Transgenics' collaboration
with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for
production of transgenic recombinant malarial proteins for use as malaria
vaccines.
Although malarial parasite genes can be expressed in other recombinant
systems, they are produced in very limited quantities or in forms that may
not induce the necessary immune response. To express the MSP-1 antigen
[MSP-1 is a protein associated with the merozoite stage of the parasite's
life cycle.] at high quantities, it was necessary to change its gene
sequence significantly without altering the protein itself. By extensively
changing portions of the nucleotide sequence of the gene, while leaving the
amino acid sequence intact, Genzyme Transgenics' scientists expressed the
antigen in the milk of transgenic mice at 2-4 mg/ml and in cell culture. In
contrast, the natural (wild-type) gene was not expressed at all.

incorporated into female mosquitoes, such transgenic mosquitoes then
becoming immunizing vectors. - Mod.CHC]
