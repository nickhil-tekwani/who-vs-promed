This year [2019], 2 cases of the West Nile virus have been reported in BC: one human, one horse.

The B.C. Centre for Disease Control told CTV News the human case was reported on Vancouver Island last month [August 2019] and is the only instance reported in B.C. so far this year.

The horse-related case was reported in the Princeton area.

Few details were provided for privacy reasons, but the BC CDC said both cases were travel-related. Both were tied to the U.S. It is not known where in the U.S. they travelled, but there was a small outbreak in eastern Oregon this year [2019].

Oregon Public Broadcasting reports there were 5 human cases and 4 horse cases this year [2019] in Harney, Deschutes and Malheur counties. Mosquitoes trapped in Ontario earlier this year tested positive, and a man near Toronto was confirmed to have the virus on Thursday [19 Sep 2019]. Another case was reported in that city in August 2019.

The virus spread by mosquitoes is rare in B.C. Prior to this year [2019], the BC CDC's data show there were 2 human cases in 2017, one in 2016 and none in 2015. There have been more horse cases reported in those years, and 2 ravens, a blue jay and one horse were infected last year [2018].

The centre says most people who contract West Nile won't realize they have the virus. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle weakness, aches, malaise, rash and sensitivity to light.

Generally, people who have the virus are told to rest and drink fluids, though they can require hospitalization.

[This may be the same horse in Princeton B.C. that was posted earlier (see West Nile virus (24): Americas, Canada (BC) horse, warning 20190811.6617190). If it is the same horse, it is curious that no mention is made of it having been in the USA. There are many unanswered questions about the locality where the person and the horse acquired their West Nile virus (WNV) infections. The possible locality in the USA is not mentioned, although Oregon is suspected. The length of time that the person and the horse (if the horse had been away from B.C.) had been in B.C. before coming down with the illness is not stated and does not permit a comparison with usual incubation periods for human and equine WNV infections. It is not mentioned whether there have been mosquito collections in B.C. this summer and if so, if WNV has been detected. If this is the same horse as earlier reported, it had been vaccinated against WNV and experienced milder disease because of that. There is no vaccine available for humans. - Mod.TY

A recent B.C. surveillance report and map going back many years refers to the above 2019 human & horse case as travel-related and therefore not mapped. There have certainly been prior native horse cases in B.C., and one human case not travel-related in 2017, according to this report http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/west-nile-virus-wnv/surveillance. A recent Vancouver newspaper article states, "In a prepared statement, the authority stated West Nile virus was first detected in B.C. in the South Okanagan during the summer of 2009. Since then there have been five recorded cases in humans, all acquired in the Okanagan." https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/risk-of-contracting-west-nile-virus-in-b-c-at-its-highest-in-august-says-health-authority. -Mod.LXL
