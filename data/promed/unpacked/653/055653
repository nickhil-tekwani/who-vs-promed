Source: List A diseases -- comments on selected diseases. From Italy's

2002, distributed to delegates during the 71st general session of the OIE,
Paris, 18 to 23 May 2003 [edited].

Bluetongue
----------
Since August 2000, Italy has lost almost 500 000 sheep in the largest
incursion of bluetongue (BT) yet to affect Europe. The 9 infected regions
(Sardinia, Sicily, Calabria, Basilicata, Campania, Apulia, Molise, Latium,
and Tuscany) account for 85 per cent of the entire Italian sheep and goat
population.
The outbreaks of BT in Italy have persisted across 3 seasons and are
defined as follows: the 2000-2001 epidemic (August 2000 to 14 May 2001);
the 2001-2002 epidemic (15 May 2001 to 14 Apr 2002), and the 2002-2003
epidemic (from 15 Apr 2002).
The outbreaks in Sardinia and central Italy (Tuscany, Latium) have involved
only BT virus (BTV) serotype 2. In Sicily and southern Italy 2 serotypes
(BTV-2 and BTV-9) have circulated. Recently, the animal sentinel system
revealed the presence of a 3rd serotype (BTV-4) in Sicily and in Calabria,
and of BTV-16 in Calabria and in the extreme south of the Apulia Region (in
the province of Lecce).
Vaccination was implemented in 2002 in conjunction with strict animal
movement controls to further reduce the spread of infection.

[Since its initial detection in Italy 3 years ago, bluetongue seems to have
succeeded in overwintering there at least twice and has reached alarming
dimensions, causing significant losses to the extensive Italian sheep
industry. The presence of 2 additional BTV serotypes on Italian territory,
BTV-4 and BTV-16, has not been previously published by ProMED-mail.
Italian investigators have initiated extensive surveillance and collected
an impressive amount of data, which can be seen at the website of the
Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise
"G.Caporale", <http://www.izs.it/> (bluetongue section, in Italian;
including maps).
In a recent paper, Sicilian investigators suggested that in parts of Italy
and possibly in other areas of Europe, where _Culicoides imicola_ -- the
commonly known vector of Bluetongue virus (BTV) in the Mediterranean basin
-- is absent or rare, _C. pulicaris_ may act as a fully competent vector of
the BTV. (See S Caracappa, et al. Identification of a novel bluetongue
virus vector species of Culicoides in Sicily. Vet Rec 2003; 153: 71-4, 19 Jul).
Accumulated data on the vaccination schemes implemented in Italy in small
and large ruminants are being collected, to be posted. - Mod.AS]
