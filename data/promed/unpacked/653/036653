HEPATITIS G - BRAZIL (2)
==========================
HGV descibed in Science is not a retrovirus.
"Thus, database acreening indicated that HGV, along with HCV,and the
GBV-A,-B, and -C viruses, belong to a distinctive group of hepatitis-
associated viruses within the family Flaviviridae". The quote is from
last month's Science paper.
