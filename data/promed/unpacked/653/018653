Anthrax investigation still yielding findings
---------------------------------------------
The deadly bacterial spores mailed to victims in the US anthrax
attacks, scientists say, share a chemical 'fingerprint' that is not
found in bacteria from the flask linked to Bruce Ivins, the
biodefence researcher implicated in the crime.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) alleges that Ivins, who
committed suicide last July [2008], was the person responsible for
mailing letters laden with _Bacillus anthracis_ to news media and
congressional offices in 2001, killing 5 people and sickening 17. The
FBI used genetic analyses to trace the mailed spores back to a flask
called RMR-1029, which Ivins could access in his laboratory at the US
Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) in
Fort Detrick, Maryland.

At the American Society for Microbiology's Biodefense and Emerging
Diseases Research Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, on 24 Feb 2009,
Joseph Michael, a materials scientist at Sandia National Laboratories
in Albuquerque, New Mexico, presented analyses of 3 letters sent to
the New York Post and to the offices of Senators Tom Daschle and
Patrick Leahy. Spores from 2 of those show a distinct chemical
signature that includes silicon, oxygen, iron, and tin; the 3rd
letter had silicon, oxygen, iron, and possibly also tin, says
Michael. Bacteria from Ivins' RMR-1029 flask did not contain any of
those 4 elements.

The chemical mismatch doesn't necessarily mean that deadly spores
used in the attacks did not originate from Ivins' RMR-1029 flask,
says Jason Bannan, a microbiologist and forensic examiner at the
FBI's Chemical Biological Sciences Unit in Quantico, Virginia. The
RMR-1029 culture was created in 1997, and the mailed spores could
have been taken out of that flask and grown under different
conditions, resulting in varying chemical contents. "It doesn't
surprise me that it would be different," he says. The data suggest
that spores for the 3 letters were grown using the same process, says
Michael. It is not clear how tin and iron made their way into the
culture, he says. Bannan suggests that the growth medium may have
contained iron and tin may have come from a water source.

Two cultures of the same anthrax strain [both Ames - Mod.MHJ] grown
using similar processes -- one from Ivins' lab, the other from a US
Army facility in Utah -- showed [a] silicon-oxygen signature but did
not contain tin or iron.

The [ASM] meeting offered scientists who collaborated with the FBI
during the investigation an opportunity to share detailed data. The
analyses will eventually be published in peer-reviewed journals, the
FBI has said.

Jacques Ravel, a genomics scientist at the University of Maryland
School of Medicine in Baltimore, described his team's efforts to find
genetic differences between various cultures of the Ames strain, the
_B. anthracis_ strain identified in the anthrax letters. At first,
the team was surprised to find that the DNA sequences of a reference
Ames strain and Ames samples from the investigation, such as bacteria
isolated from the spinal fluid of the 1st victim, were exactly the
same.

For help, the researchers turned to variants found [in the letters]
by a team at USAMRIID. Patricia Worsham and her colleagues had
noticed differences in shape, colour, and rate of spore formation
even within a single anthrax culture. Ravel's team identified the
genetic mutations associated with 4 variants and developed an assay
for one of them, called Morph E. Researchers at Commonwealth
Biotechnologies in Richmond, Virginia, and the Midwest Research
Institute's Florida Division in Palm Bay created assays for [the] 3
other variants.

The FBI then used that arsenal of tests to pin down the origins of
the anthrax letters, matching the mix of genetic variants in the
mailed spores to Ivins' RMR-1029 flask. "It has the genetic
signatures that identify it as the most likely source of the growth,"
says Bannan.

Ravel also sequenced the genome of a _Bacillus subtilis_ strain that
was found in one of the letters. That sample did not match a _B.
subtilis_ strain found in Ivins' lab, says Bannan, but the bacterial
contamination still could have come from somewhere else in Ivins'
institution [that is, USAMRIID].

The FBI has asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to convene
an independent panel of experts to review the anthrax investigation
data. The academy is still in the process of drawing up a contract
with the FBI that lays out an agreement to perform the study, says
NAS spokeswoman Christine Stencel.

Thomas DeGonia, Ivins' lawyer at Venable LLP in Rockville, Maryland,
maintains Ivins' innocence.

[The tin and iron were not in the mix in the RMR-1029 flask, nor was
silicon. And the flask contents date from 1997. A lot can happen in
4-5 years (1997-2001).

RMR-1029 was a conglomeration of 13 production runs of spores by
Dugway, for USAMRIID, and an additional 22 production runs of spore
preparations at USAMRIID that were all pooled into this mixture. It
was a total of over 164 liters of spore production, concentrated down
to about a liter. Source:

RMR-1029 was a one-time operation to create a "gold standard" for
vaccine testing. Many precautions would have been taken in those
preparations, but due to the unusual size of the production runs the
4 mutations appeared. - Mod MHJ]

Revealed: scientific evidence for the 2001 anthrax attacks
----------------------------------------------------------
Key forensic evidence in the US anthrax attacks of 2001 has been
revealed. The FBI had previously prevented the scientists involved
from speaking publicly about their findings in case this interfered
with court proceedings, but last August [2008], after chief suspect
Bruce Ivins committed suicide, the case collapsed and the FBI lifted
many of the restrictions. This week [24 Feb 2009], some of the
scientists involved revealed their results at a scientific meeting in
Baltimore, Maryland.

These show how the FBI traced the spores used in the attacks to a
single flask at a US government lab, but they don't explain why the
FBI made Ivins -- who worked at the US Army Medical Research
Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) -- the chief suspect.

In late 2001, envelopes containing dry anthrax spores were sent to a
number of US media outlets and politicians, leading to 5 deaths.
Later that year, Paul Keim at the Northern University of Arizona in
Flagstaff identified the anthrax bacterium used in the attack as the
US army's 'Ames' strain. The FBI then obtained 1072 anthrax samples
from the 18 labs it knew to have Ames and got several research
groups, including Keim's, to compare their genomes with that of the
strain used in the attacks. The hope was this would uncover mutations
that would finger one lab as the source.

But Keim and his colleagues told the Baltimore meeting that initial
reports that useful mutations had been found were misleading. The
full genome sequences revealed "no genetic differences at all," says
Keim. Instead, the researchers say, the key clues came from a lucky
discovery. A technician, also at USAMRIID, had noticed patches of
unusual-looking spores in cultures of the attack anthrax, and
recultured just those. Keim and colleagues sequenced their genomes
and found 10 mutations that differed from the common Ames sequence.
Because the spores made up a fraction of the total, these "minority"
mutations hadn't shown up initially.

Next the team developed highly sensitive tests to screen all 1072
samples for 4 of the mutations. Eight samples had all 4 [mutations].
One came from a flask labelled RMR-1029 that Ivins was responsible
for at USAMRIID. The other 7 came from cultures taken from that
flask, only one of which was not located at USAMRIID. So while these
findings show the attack spores came from one of these cultures, the
FBI has gone further in concluding the attack came directly from the
RMR-1029 flask.

Another question is how the attacker turned the water-based slurry of
spores in the flask to the fine, dry powder in the letters.

Joseph Michael of the Sandia National Lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
used specialised electron microscopy to show that 75 per cent of the
attack spores had incorporated silicon into their coats while growing
(see image at
<http://www.newscientist.com/data/images/ns/cms/mg20126974.100/mg20126974.100-2_300.jpg>).
As spores taken directly from RMR-1029 following the attacks had no
silicon in their coats, and the other 7 genetic matches had either
none or a lower percentage, the attack spores must have been
recultured before they were posted.

During this process, they would have shed their coats, multiplied,
then turned back into spores. Was Ivins's level of expertise needed
to turn these recultured spores into dry powder? Michael's images
show the attack anthrax contained spore clumps, unlike professionally
produced powders.

The FBI may have evidence to show Ivins was the link between RMR-1029
and the envelopes, though with civil suits from Ivins' and the
victims' families pending, the bureau won't be revealing it soon. For
now, the researchers say their studies nail the spores as coming from
the flask, but not the identity of the attacker.

[It will be interesting to see what the FBI's conclusive evidence is
directly linking Bruce Ivins to the letter products. The latter
contained 65-75 per cent of the spores with Si in their spore coats,
not 75 per cent as reported by MacKenzie. The USAMRIID test culture
had only 6 per cent and a Dugway product 30 per cent; both had been
grown on Leighton-Doi media. An interesting paper by WG Murrell,
"Chemical composition of spores & spore structures", in 'The
Bacterial Spore', eds GW Hurst & A Hurst, Academic Press, NY, 1969,
reported the Si content by dry weight in a range of spores with a
mean value of 0.53 per cent, maximum 1.2 per cent and minimum 0.2 per
cent. The existing literature would indicate that high values of Si
in spores is unusual, if not exceptional.

In conclusion, the attack spores, somehow derived from RMR-1029, must
have been recultured before they were processed and posted if they
had such a high Si presence, and also to have acquired iron and tin,
neither of which were/are in the RMR-1029 spores. - Mod.MHJ]
