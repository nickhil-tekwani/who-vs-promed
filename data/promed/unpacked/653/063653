A summary article describing the role vampire bats play in transmitting
rabies to cattle in Latin America and the method developed to reduce these
losses is: Mitchell, G.C. 1986. Vampire bat control in Latin America.
Pages 151-164 in National Research Council. Ecological Knowledge and
Environmental Problem-Solving: Concepts and Case Studies. National Academy
Press. The technique of capturing live vampire bats near cattle, smearing
their backs with an anticoagulant paste and releasing them to return to
their roost for mutual grooming was very cost-beneficial.

From a previous post: [There are a number of vampire bat species involved
in rabies and with different roosting habits. In my experience in Brazil,
vampire bat rabies would break out in cattle some two to three years after
forest & woodland clearances because the bats no longer had sufficient
animals to feed on in the forest and were forced to search outside, which
brought them to feed on the cattle. - MHJ
Although there are 3 species of vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_, the
common vampire bat; _Diphylla ecaudata_, hairy-legged vampire bat; and
_Diaemus youngi_, the white-winged vampire bat), as far as I understand,
only the common vampire bat is significantly involved with bovine paralytic
rabies. This is supported by Brass (1994) who notes the following (p.
58-59): although they may become infected with the rabies virus, _Diaemus_
and _Diphylla_ are generally not considered to be significant in the cycle
of rabies transmission to livestock or humans. Few investigations have been
made of these bats and little is known of their habits or biology
(Greenhall, 1972a). _Desmodus_ is the most common of the vampires, has the
widest distribution, and is the most well known of the three. _Diaemus_ is
the rarest and least studied. The relative abundance of _Desmodus_ may be
related to its more liberal tastes in animal blood and the wider range of
its host populations (Villa-Ramirez, 1969). Of the 3 species of vampire
bats, the common vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_, is implicated almost
exclusively in the transmission of paralytic rabies to livestock
(Greenhall, 1974) .
A lack of a significant link between the other two species of vampires and
bovine paralytic rabies is somewhat to be expected. _Diphylla_ and
_Diaemus_ both apparently prefer avian blood rather than mammalian blood.
They are much less likely to use cattle as a host species. Indeed,
_Diphyllais_ thought to be close to an avian blood specialist. More
information can be found in Greenhall (1988).
Perhaps someone else knows of more recent literature which links either
_Diphylla_ or _Diaemus_ to cycles of bovine paralytic rabies. If so, I (at
least) would be interested in the references.
For further information on vampire control methods, one place to look is
Bat Conservation International's Latin American Initiative on vampire bat
control. Information is located online at
<http://www.batcon.org/pcmm/vampire.html>.
They have even put out a video (available in English, Spanish, or
Portuguese) entitled Controlling Vampire Bats and Bovine Rabies. The
video is available through the BCI catalog at
<http://www.batcon.org/catalog/catp8.html>
