The press office of Armenia's Ministry of Health reported 2 patients in Nork Infectious Disease Hospital in Yerevan got their "anthrax" diagnosis confirmed. The patients' condition is satisfactory today [5 Aug 2015], positive trends are seen, according to the report.

Prevention measures are being taken.

According to an earlier report of the Ministry of Health, 2 residents of Artamed village, Armavir of Armenia, were hospitalized for suspected anthrax. The patients were then transferred from Armavir medical center to Nork Infectious Disease Hospital in Yerevan.

The study showed that patients bought meat in Ninotsminda region of Georgia on [24 Jul 2015]. A week later they found ulcers on their hands and consulted a doctor.

Medical control is maintained over everybody who contacted the meat exports from Georgia. Disinfection works have been carried out.

[For a map of Armenia, showing Armavir, go to http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/armenia_physio-2002.jpg. Armavir is to the west of the capital Yerevan and borders Turkey. Georgia is some 100 miles (161 km) to the north. Ninotsminda is just across the border in Georgia from northwest Armenia; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/georgia_rel99.jpg. This makes it a logical place for Armenians to visit and shop.

This is not the 1st instance of a Georgian source of cutaneous anthrax in Armenians. There were 2 similarly afflicted in 2013. Anthrax is, at best, sporadic in Armenia and seen only in cattle and with associated cases in humans. However 2012 was worrisome as there were 17 outbreaks in 5 provinces and 42 bovine cases. Vaccination has been stepped up and from the OIE data the cattle were vaccinated twice in 2014.

On the other hand, anthrax is enzootic in Georgia with cattle, sheep, and horses affected. The human case load reflects this with 81 cases (1 death) in 2011, 30 in 2012, 142 (1 death) in 2013, and 67 cases in 2014. It is safer to buy meat in street markets in Armenia. - Mod.MHJ]
