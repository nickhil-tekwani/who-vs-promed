A third of Scotland's salmon producers who faced tight restrictions
because of a deadly fish virus have been given the 'all-clear' to
begin farming again. Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) has crippled
the fish farming industry -- causing job losses and leaving it millions
of [UK pounds out of pocket.
Deputy Minister for Rural Affairs John Home Robertson
announced the end of restrictions on 83 salmon farms affected by
the disease. Seven of these farms closed their operations as a
result of the virus. The Scottish Executive said the 7 farms had
successfully completed 'clean-up' requirements which included
destroying all stocks and clearing their waters. Five of the farms
were closed after confirmed cases of ISA and 2 others were
suspected of carrying the disease.
Mr Home Robertson said: "Over the past 15 months the salmon
farming industry has had to live with regular announcements of new
outbreaks of ISA. As a result, movement restrictions had to be
imposed upon those farms and others in the surrounding areas."
"We are not out of the woods yet and certainly cannot be
complacent, but it is good to see some of those farms affected by
ISA returning to normal business. In time, I hope to be able to give
the 'all clear' to the remaining farms under restrictions. Meanwhile,
we will remain extremely vigilant."
