Australia's 1st case of a human infected with bacteria from cat fleas
has been reported by a Newcastle doctor who says the disease may be
more common than the general practitioners (GPs) thought. The case
study appeared in the Medical Journal of Australia that documents a
Victorian family infected with _Rickettsia felis_ after exposure to a
kitten infested with fleas. Murdoch University scientists confirmed
the presence of _R. felis_ in cat fleas on cats and dogs in Western
Australia (WA) for the 1st time in 2006.

According to Director of Microbiology at John Hunter Hospital Doctor
Stephen Graves, 3 children and an adult were hospitalized with fever
and rash. A 9-year-old girl became seriously ill in Melbourne and her
younger sister and brother, grandmother and neighbor had to be taken
to hospital after they were bitten by fleas carrying the _R. felis_
bacteria from kittens the family brought into their home. He added,
"It's likely to be present all over Australia, I suspect. It's just
that people haven't looked for it. This little girl was really quite
sick and in intensive care. She may have died if she had not got the
right antibiotics ultimately."

Dr. Graves hopes to raise the awareness regarding this disease among
GPs. He said, "There's an educational purpose behind it, and that is
to let people know that this is a disease that's here. If you have a
patient that has fever and a rash, and they have been associated with
cat fleas, or even dog fleas, then this may be the type of illness it
is. And there is significance to that, because they can be treated
with antibiotics."

Dr. Graves explained that there are numerous different types of
rickettsia disease, which is a type of bacteria that can be found in
parasites such as fleas and ticks. Murine typhus, a rickettsia
infection from rat fleas, was particularly common in WA he added. _R.
felis_ is the strain of rickettsia that is found in cat fleas and is
common in North America, Europe and Asia. He said, "This disease
hasn't been recognized in Australia before. It's almost certainly
been here but it hasn't been recognised because we didn't have the
correct diagnostic test to determine that it was this type of infection."

[ProMED generally does not report issues related to journal articles
but it is felt that the emerging recognition of _R. felis_ was
worthwhile to note.

There are a number of diseases with typhus literally, or
figuratively, in their names: epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease
(recrudescent epidemic typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and
typhoid (so-called because it is typhus-like). The term typhus comes
from the Greek, _typhein_ -- to smoke -- which may refer to the smoky
or clouded mental status that patients present with. With parallels
to murine typhus (see below), perhaps this infection should be
referred to as feline typhus although the organism is actually
classified as a spotted fever-type rickettsia.

The disease related to _R. felis_ seems to be most like murine
typhus, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_. Murine typhus is distributed
widely throughout the world, especially in the warm and humid coastal
environments of tropic and subtropical climes. It is a zoonosis, in
which cats function as the disease's asymptomatic reservoir. Since
_R. typhi_ and _R. felis_ are closely related (differing by only 32
nucleotides) and the infections can only be distinguished by specific
PCR assays, some or perhaps many cases of murine typhus-like disease
may be caused by _R. felis_ which was originally isolated from cat
fleas in 1990.

The distribution of the organism in cat fleas is widespread (1),
including the USA, Brazil, Mexico and Spain in the Western Hemisphere
and it has also be found in Africa and in the Old World including
Australia, Viet Nam, Indonesia and South Korea. Not surprisingly,
human cases shown to be due to _R. felis_ has expanded to most of
these areas as specific PCR testing became more available.

Although rickettsia-infected flea feces being rubbed into a flea bite
appears to be the major vehicle of transmission to man, flea bites
themselves, and aerosolization of flea feces, may transmit infection
as well. The organism has not only been found in the cat flea
(_Ctenocephalides felis_) but in other fleas as well as ticks and
mites. Other feral animals such as the opossum can be hosts for _R.
felis _ as well (2).

Murine typhus is a relatively mild febrile disease with or without a
rash as compared to epidemic typhus. Among patients admitted to an
acute care hospital with this disease, only 10 percent require
intensive care, but 1-4 percent die. Not enough data exists for
"feline typhus" but documentation of severe cases exists including
hepatitis (3) and meningitis (4).
