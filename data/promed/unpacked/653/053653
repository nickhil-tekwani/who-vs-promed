The number of people infected with measles reached 499 in Aktobe region of Kazakhstan from 1 Jan 2020 to Feb 2020, the Department of Control of Quality and Safety of Goods and Services of the region said.

Over the past year, the number of parents refusing vaccination of children has been growing, which is increasing the risk of infection of children, specialists say.

More than 2000 children in Aktobe were not vaccinated after refusal of their parents.

An unfavorable measles epidemic situation remains in the country, including in Aktobe region, head of the Department Nursulu Berkimbayeva said.

More than 72% of measles cases were registered among unvaccinated citizens in Aktobe region.

[3] Ethiopia: outbreak in 5 regions

A total of more than 12 000 cases of measles were reported in 36 zones of 5 regions of Ethiopia in the past 13 months beginning January 2019, according to the UN. "Oromia region bore the brunt of the outbreaks, with 67 per cent of cases, followed by Somali with 21 per cent," the UN added.

"Most recently in December 2019 and January 2020, about 1400 cases were reported in East Wellega, East Hararge, West Hararge, Arsi, West Arsi, Shashemene town, West Shewa, Wolaita, Bale, Jima, Gamo, Siti, Kolaher, and Afder zones."

The continued measles outbreaks were most likely a result of low routine vaccination coverage: 69 per cent of the cases reported not having received a single dose of measles vaccine before the infection, while 12 per cent could not recall encountering such a service. Therefore, the UN said, "only 20 per cent of the cases were sure of receiving either one or 2 doses of measles vaccine." Of this, 53 per cent of the cases were children under the age of 5, 25 per cent were aged between 5 and 14 years, and 21 per cent were between the age of 15 and 45 years, meaning there are multiple age cohorts without herd immunity.

1. Measles - DRC: epidemic with high lethality, MSF alert

Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF] warns of world's worst measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

Complications in world's deadliest measles outbreak in Kinshasa

Health workers are racing against a number of challenges to halt the spread of the world's worst outbreak of measles that is afflicting the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

More than 6000 people have died over the past year alone, with 3/4ths of fatalities being children. Over 310 000 people have been infected.

The outbreak has affected all 26 provinces of the volatile country that is experiencing a myriad of illnesses.

MSF is battling to control the surge in the province of Kongo Central. It is one of the main hotspots of the epidemic today. The region is enduring complex health issues.

"Some of the main challenges we face are the complications linked with associated diseases such as malaria or malnutrition," said an MSF spokesperson.

The official said these issues increased the risk of mortality.

Gaining access to remote hard-to-reach areas is also a risk owing to the insecurity posed by armed groups involved in skirmishes with the national army.

At least 424 attacks on health care workers occurred in the DRC between January and November 2019, according to Insecurity Insight.

The outbreak of measles has turned into the biggest measles outbreak of the past 10 years in DRC and the biggest worldwide.

Measles, which spreads easily through coughs and sneezes, is highly contagious and affects mainly children.

In DRC, it comes at a time the country is also experiencing an outbreak of Ebola that has killed over 2000 people since August 2018.

[5] Tonga: Measles Outbreak 2019-20. Situation Report 18
Date: Thu 13 Feb 2020
Source: Relief Web from Government of Tonga [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/tonga/tonga-measles-outbreak-2019-20-situation-report-18


1. Summary of Situation

Background

The outbreak of measles in Tonga began in early October 2019, following the return of a national youth team of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand. The index case developed measles while in New Zealand. Subsequently, a further 12 teammates developed laboratory-confirmed measles. The early outbreak involved mainly teenagers from associated schools on Tongatapu and Vava'u Islands. Since the initial 2 waves of the outbreak, cases were widely reported in all age groups but are now declining.

An inter-disciplinary Ministry of Health Epidemic Task Force (ETF) meets weekly to advise on management of the outbreak. In addition to routine outbreak response activities, a time-limited vaccination program targeting secondary school students and 6-11 month-old infants was conducted between October and December 2019. Additional immunization activities have been conducted in January and February 2020 to target the 1-9 year olds.

Note: Refer to earlier sitreps for further details of the initial cases and response.

2. Current Situation
- As of 12 Feb 2020, 659 confirmed and suspected cases of measles have been reported in Tonga. To date, 98 specimens have been tested for measles, of which 78 (79.6%) have been PCR laboratory confirmed.

- Of 659 cases, 581 (88.1%) cases occurred on Tongatapu and 66 (10.1 %) occurred on Vava'u Island. Figure 1 shows the epidemic curve for the current outbreak in Tonga.

- Ongoing transmission of measles virus in Tongatapu and Vava'u. Onset of illness for most recent case in Tongatapu was 7 Feb 2020. Onset of illness for last reported case in Vava'u was 8 Jan 2020 (36 days to date). Islands of Ha'apai, Eua and Niuas have interrupted transmission (Table 1).

- Between 6 Feb and 12 Feb 2020 (7 days), 3 new cases were reported. All reported cases were from the island of Tongatapu. Of the 3 new cases, one case is in an infant aged 6 months (male) whose mother was a suspect case in the previous epidemiological week. The infant is currently hospitalised and is stable.

- To date there are 21 hospitalizations (one new hospitalization this week).

- Throughout the course of the outbreak, most cases presented with mild symptoms, and were mostly managed by home isolation.

- No deaths have been reported till date.

- Of the 659 cases, the majority (454, 68.9%) of cases have been in males. This is consistent with early transmission occurring in male boarding schools.

- Figure 2 presents age and gender graph for all cases of measles in the current outbreak. The majority (437, 66.3%) of cases occurred in persons aged 10-19 years (Figure 2 and Table 2).

- Vaccination records have been verified for 565/659 (85.7%) cases.

[7] Cost of measles outbreak

J Pike, AJ Leidner, PA Gastanaduy . A review of measles outbreak cost estimates from the US in the post-elimination era (2004-2017): Estimates by perspective and cost type. Clinical Infectious Diseases, ciaa070, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa070
Published: 22 Jan 2020


US measles outbreaks cost USD 42 million, according to "conservative" estimate.

The response to the 2019 measles outbreaks in the United States cost roughly USD 42 million, based on estimates outlined in a recent study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, although researchers said this is likely an underestimate.

"By looking at the cost to respond to incredibly contagious diseases, such as measles, we can get a better understanding of the resources necessary to prepare for another outbreak of measles or another disease, as well as get a clearer picture of the real value of public health prevention efforts," Jamison Pike, PhD, MS, a health economist in the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told Healio. "Our review of the smaller outbreaks between 2001 and 2017 provided a framework for us to analyze the costs of much larger measles outbreaks in 2018 and 2019."

Pike and colleagues performed a literature review, ultimately including 10 studies published between 2001 and 2018 that examined cost estimates from 11 measles outbreaks.

They determined the overall median total costs of the 11 outbreaks to be USD 152 308 (ranging from USD 9862 to USD 1 063 936), USD 115 102 from a public health perspective and USD 76 509 from a provider perspective. They additionally determined that the median cost per day was USD 10 710 based on chain duration and USD 3873 based on investigation period. According to the study, the median cost per case was USD 32 805 and per contact was USD 223.

Pike told Healio that based on these estimates, the 2019 U.S. measles outbreaks -- which included 1282 cases, according to the CDC -- cost USD 42 million, "an underestimate of the real cost," Pike said.

Despite the estimates not accounting for direct medical costs and productivity losses, Pike said the findings are of "particular importance" to public health departments because of recent increases in measles activity, and because many local health departments are experiencing reductions in resources and do not have "outbreak budget reserves."

"Measles is a deadly disease that spreads quickly from person to person, and it is completely preventable," Pike said. "It is important for public health officials, health care providers, school systems and other community leaders to work together to prevent measles through vaccination but also prepare for the cost of a possible outbreak in their communities."

[While 94% of American parents vaccinate their children as recommended, an estimated 100 000 children under age 2 are unvaccinated, the New York Times reported in 2019 (https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/health/measles-outbreak-cdc.html).

The reasons why parents don't vaccinate their children vary: Some are poor and unaware of the need for vaccinations, while others choose to not vaccinate kids for religious reasons or because they have bought into the debunked myths that vaccines cause autism or other medical problems. In many cases, the people who aren't vaccinating their children are rich and well-educated "helicopter parents" who opt out of vaccine recommendations for "philosophical" reasons [See https://money.com/measles-outbreak-2019-cost-vaccine/].

The figures in the report presented here don't incorporate the costs of measles infection to the affected families, who are being hit the hardest. Not only must they deal with children or other family members being sick, they are likely facing huge out-of-pocket expenses from high-deductible insurance plans, plus the possibility of lost wages if they do not have sick leave at their jobs.

The cost of the measles mumps rubella vaccine is USD 21.22 if administered through a CDC contract or USD 78.68 for private providers. Contract prices are those for CDC vaccine contracts that are established for the purchase of vaccines by immunization programs that receive CDC immunization cooperative agreement funds (i.e., state health departments, certain large city immunization projects, and certain current and former U.S. territories). Private providers and private citizens cannot directly purchase vaccines through CDC contracts. Private sector prices are those reported by vaccine manufacturers annually to CDC. The manufacturer is Merck (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html).

While the cost of private administration of the MMR vaccine is not insignificant and prices for vaccines have increased steadily over time, they are now typically covered by insurance. The cost of treating a sick child is significantly higher, especially if complications occur. Therefore, the full vaccine regimen is highly recommended. - Mod LK]
