JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS - INDIA (ASSAM)

This is to report the outbreak of Japanese encephalitis cases with high
mortality in North Lakhimpur district and Dhemaji area of Assam.
This area is very susceptible to the outbreaks of JE as is evidenced by
past records. The first large scale epidemic of JE was investigated by me
in 1978. Since then JE vaccine has been available, but not used in this
area. The causes are (a) unstable
government, (b) insurgency, (c) lack of funds, and (d) possibly [lack of]
political will.
