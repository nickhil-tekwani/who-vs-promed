New respiratory virus infections in Canada
------------------------------------------
The following background information on "newer" viral respiratory
infections in Canada was abstracted from the Gideon Database
.

Prevalence surveys:
-------------------
Human matapneumovirus (HMPV) is found in 4.1 per cent of adults with
community-acquired pneumonia (2005 publication).
HMPV is found in 9.5 per cent of respiratory specimens from the community
and 25 per cent of outbreaks; median age was 24 months (Calgary, 2007
publication).
HMPV is found in 14.8 per cent of patients with acute respiratory tract
infection (4 provinces, 2001 to 2002 influenza season).
HMPV is found in 8 per cent of acute lower respiratory tract infections
(Montreal, 2001).
HMPV is found in 3.9 per cent of pediatric inpatients and outpatients
(Alberta, 2002 to 2003).
HMPV is found in 6 per cent of children below age 3 years hospitalized for
acute respiratory tract infections (Quebec, 2001 to 2002).
HMPV is found in 13.5 per cent of children aged under 5 years, 26.1 per
cent of children aged 6 to 10 years, 32.3 per cent of children aged 11 to
15 years, 99.0 per cent of persons agd 16 to 30 years, 91.7 per cent of
adults aged 31 to 60 years, 93.8 per cent of persons aged over 60 years in
Saskatchewan seropositive (2007 publication).
HMPV is found in 4 per cent of adults hospitalized with community-acquired
pneumonia (Edmonton, 2008 publication).

Human coronavirus 63 (NL63) is found in 3.62 per cent of respiratory
specimens collected during the winter of 2001 to 2003.
NL63 is found in 2.1 per cent of specimens in a separate study during 2002
to 2003.
NL63 is found in 3 per cent of children below age 3 hospitalized for
respiratory disease (winters of 2001 to 2003).

Human bocavirus (HBoV) is found in 1.5 per cent of respiratory specimens
(Saskatchewan, 2003 to 2004).
HBoV is found in 5.1 per cent of hospitalized children below the age of 17
years with respiratory infection (Alberta, 2002 to 2003).
HBoV is found in 0.8 per cent of symptomatic adults, 13.8 per cent of
symptomatic children, and 43 per cent of asymptomatic children (2002 to 2003).

WU polyomavirus is found in 2.5 per cent of children with respiratory
infection and 6.8 per cent of asymptomatic children (Quebec, 2002 to 2003).

Notable outbreaks:
------------------
2003 -- An outbreak (95 cases) of coronavirus OC43 infection was reported
in British Colombia.
2006 -- An outbreak (96 cases, 12 fatal) of respiratory illness at a long
