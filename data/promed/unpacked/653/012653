1. In response to the moderator's request for information in the posting
"Rift Valley fever - Saudi Arabia: (Asir) suspected, RFI 20081203.3798:"
Firstly, please note that RVF vaccination in Saudi Arabia is applied in
young animals using the live attenuated RVF Smithburn strain vaccine (Ref
1). More details can be found in the said paper and in Ref 2.

2. As to the moderator's hint at a possible East African source, the
possibility of other RVFV-like viruses being involved arises. I would like
to remind the reader that during the 1997/98 outbreak in East Africa,
clinical pictures similar to RVF eventually turned out to be caused by
another member of the _Bunyaviridae_, named Garissa virus (Ref 3). Possible
involvement of other Bunyaviruses deserves consideration also in view of
the lack of observed disease symptoms characteristic of RVF in reportedly
infected animals.

3. The suggested endemicity of RVFV in Saudi Arabia is supported by
evidence from a government lab in the RVF-prone area. In 2004, the Ministry
of Agric workers detected local natural infection in sentinel animals used
in surveillance programs (Ref 1). There were no camels amongst the sentinel
animals.

4. The role of camels in the emergence and spread of RVF in the region
seems not to be given much attention, as shown in local surveys (Ref 2). A
published sero-surveillance report on camels detected one single RVF
IgG-positive camel among 496 animals tested (0.2 per cent) (Ref 4). Details
on exactly where and when the positive sample was taken as well as
information on confirmation of the Indirect ELISA used by other means or
further investigations are not given. These authors again acknowledge the
present lack of camel sentinels. Camels are known to move through extensive
areas that again present exposure determination challenges. Sadly, little
is still known of RVF pathogenicity in camels. In addition, most of the
valuable ELISA protocols are not validated for this species. However,
camels are susceptible, and their movements between the Gulf States (Ref 5)
may constitute a risk pathway that needs to be evaluated. This is of
particular importance to neighbouring countries like UAE where efforts are
being made to export camel products to Europe. The need to increase
camel-related RVF monitoring/research cannot be overemphasized.

5. Even though enzootic, possible routes of RVFV reintroduction still
exist. The government is well aware of this potential problem, and strict
requirements are said to have been applied for newly permitted livestock
imports from Sudan and Eritrea. However, the potential for entry via
nontraditional routes remains. Private zoos and individuals in the region
do import susceptible wildlife from RVF endemic regions of Africa; these
may not be adequately covered by local RVF surveillance and thus may
contribute to undetected local transmission. While efforts to better
understand the role of wildlife in RVF inter-epizootic maintenance are
still ongoing, there is evidence that wildlife is actively infected by RVF.
As reported in postings 20080210.0541 and 20080701.2012, RVF-affected
buffaloes have passed infection to humans in South Africa earlier this year
[2008]; such animals are found in private zoos.

6. The report on the Asir suspected human case says: "The man was initially
diagnosed with an unknown type of fever and elevated liver enzyme levels,
both indicators of RVF." With the RVFV specific IgM unconfirmed,
differential diagnoses such as dengue and Alkhurmah haemorrhagic fever
viruses come to mind; they should receive more consideration if the initial
IgM turns out to be false positive. The latter virus is thought to be
under-diagnosed.

7. Statements such as "the symptoms could be either a real viral infection
or a side effect of the antibody injection previously used on the animals
to ward off the virus" are really confusing and may be due to translation
errors from an Arabic original as well as inaccuracy in reporting
infectious diseases by the media. This was experienced in the 1st RVF
outbreak in 2000. In the same light, the use of the term "cattle" should be
interpreted cautiously, since the word "mawaashi" (which means livestock)
in Arabic has in past reports been mistranslated to "cattle," erroneously
excluding other livestock, particularly small ruminants. Susceptible sheep
and goats are, generally, more ubiquitous than cattle in these regions.

8. The above quoted statement further indicates lack of clarity regarding
the RVF vaccination status of the animals in the affected area. The risk of
reversion to virulence does exist with live attenuated vaccines; these
vaccines also do not allow for the differential identification between
infected and vaccinated animals [DIVA] (Ref 6); it would be interesting to
see the local adoption/trial of the new DIVA recombinant RVF vaccine
developed by these authors. Without more evidence, especially evidence
generated using molecular tools to sequence and characterize any virus
isolated, it would be difficult to trace the source of the virus. Using
such protocols, it might have been possible to judge the possibility of
vaccine reversion.

9. If and when RVF is confirmed (which is not the case so far), the
potential risks for pilgrims in Makkah is not one that can be easily
extrapolated. A general analysis of such potential risks was given by Glyn
Davies in his paper 2 years ago (Ref 7). However, since he probably did not
have the opportunity to be present on location during the pilgrimage
itself, may I add several other dynamic variables for consideration. One's
familiarity with the Haj rites, abattoirs and fellow veterinarians there
may enable suggesting that risk exposure pathways vary greatly amongst the
pilgrims, who come from virtually all over the world. A generalized risk
analysis may not be possible: Potential exposure pathways can only be
developed by factoring in these various dynamic variables. These variables
depend on the pilgrims' nationalities and the attendant cultural
diversities expressed by the country of origin, purchasing power, etc. Even
intra-national variations in potential risk exposure patterns will and do
exist. For example, not all pilgrims are required to slaughter an animal.
How many pilgrims opt for this and why? How many of them carry out the
slaughter and subsequently consume the slaughtered meat? Going into such
details is far beyond the scope of a comment here. It should be noted that
several official sanitary, risk reducing measures have been operational for
many years. For example, there is a system of coupon-mediated proxy
slaughter that limits access of pilgrims to live animals and coordinates
animal movement. It is, however, not known how many of the pilgrims make
use of this facility and at what level. The government has also limited
outward movement of animals from the Makkah area [see item 2]. However, it
is not clear whether the mentioned measures will cover other routes of
transmission, namely mosquitoes and nontraditional hosts. Stray cats are
potential nontraditional alternative hosts. They are present in enormous
numbers in the Makkah region; they can easily access abattoirs, carcasses,
as well as provide meals for abundant tiger mosquitoes, _Aedes (Stegomyia)
albopictus_, which feed on animals and humans.

10. What further abates any fear of a massive RVF epizootic is the fact
that, though there were heavy rains in the RVF-endemic areas in early
November 2008, the expected interval for trans-ovarially infected
mosquitoes to erupt and infect susceptible animals/humans, followed by a
short incubation period, can be said to have elapsed. However, this does
not obviate the need to confirm post rain fall vector dynamics and confirm
whether local RVF epizootics will not be always similar to the rainfall
associated patterns in East Africa.

In summary, while a risk does exist for RVF transmission, its full
evaluation requires detailed information on local conditions and on ground
risk parameters. Until confirmed, there is no need to stoke up fears.
Proactive preventive measures can be heightened. Whenever confirmed,
analytical risk deductions are best done on a nationality to nationality
basis. It is also hoped that the new risk levels will increase commitment
to research on this and other arboviral zoonoses.

Authorities have imposed a ban on removing livestock from Makkah during
Haj, Dr Fahd Balghunaim, minister of agriculture, said here on Saturday [6
Dec 2008].

He said his ministry has adopted a number of preventive measures to avoid a
recurrence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) and bird flu, pointing out that the
ban on importing live birds was still in place. The government is taking
extra precautions since there was a suspected case of RVF in Asir Region
recently after a Bangladeshi national was hospitalized there with symptoms
of the disease. The minister said importing livestock from Sudan and Syria
has been resumed to meet the increasing demand during this season after
confirming implementation of health specifications by the 2 countries [See
additional media sources on the Saudi animal import policy in the
commentary at the bottom of this posting. - Mod.AS].

"The ministry has provided additional staff for Makkah Region's land and
sea entry points in order to deal with the increasing number of livestock
arriving in Jeddah. The staff include veterinary personnel working round
the clock to examine animals at entry points," Balghunaim said.
