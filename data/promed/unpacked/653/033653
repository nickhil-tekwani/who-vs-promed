Regarding the 2007 EHD outbreak in Indiana, the report originating
from the Lafayette Courier Journal contained the following statement,
which appears to be erroneous: "The current [2007] outbreak is
centered in Greene, Clay, Owen, Parke, Putnam, Sullivan, Vermillion,
Fountain, and Vigo counties."
In fact, those were the counties involved in the 2006 outbreak.
Indiana Counties implicated so far in the 2007 EHD outbreak are
Adams, Brown, Clark, Clay, Crawford, Davies, Dearborn, Dubois,
Gibson, Green, Jackson, Jay, Jefferson, Jennings, Knox, Lawrence,
Martin, Morgan, Orange, Perry, Pike, Posey, Scott, Spencer,
Vanderburg, Warrick, and Washington counties. EHD-like symptoms are
also being reported in seropositive cattle from those same counties.

An insect-borne virus may be the cause of more than 100 deer deaths
this summer [2007] in Western North Carolina (WNC), according to
officials from the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission.
Hemorrhagic disease, which is carried by the biting midge, is the
most likely cause of the dead deer that have been found in the
region. Biologists say the disease is common among deer populations
but rare in WNC, where the majority of this summer's [2007] cases
have been reported.
"We see it every year to some degree in different parts of the state,
but we've never seen it quite like this," said Mike Carraway, a
wildlife biologist with the state Wildlife Commission.
Other states in the Southeast also have reported outbreaks of the
disease. Hemorrhagic disease is not harmful to humans or other
animals but has the potential to wipe out a quarter of a deer herd.
Since July 2007, there have been 12 reported deaths in Madison County
and about 20 in Henderson County. About 70 of the 300 deer at
Biltmore Estate have died from the disease.
"We have been removing anything in areas where guests or employees
could have contact with them," said Ted Katsigianis, vice president
of cultural science at the Biltmore Estate. "Most visitors come in
and out of the gates and wouldn't know the difference."
There is no cure for the disease, and the deer will likely continue
to die until cold, wet weather moves in and kills the
disease-carrying midge population, said Evin Stanford, a deer
biologist at with the state Wildlife Commission.
"There's absolutely nothing you can do about this disease," he said.
Stanford said he does not know why this year's [2007] outbreak is so
virulent in WNC. This summer's dry, hot weather could have
contributed to an increase in the midge population, he said.
Deer in WNC do not often encounter the disease, and they may not have
as much immunity as animals in eastern North Carolina, he said
The agency has sent samples to the University of Georgia for testing
to verify that hemorrhagic disease is the cause of the deaths.
"We're pretty confident that's what it is," Stanford said. "There are
very few things that can go through a deer herd like that."
Biologists said the reduced deer population will not have any adverse
effects on the ecosystem, should not have any long-term effects on
the deer population and will not affect deer hunting season.
The last major outbreak of the disease was in 2002, when the
Southeast also was experiencing drought conditions. Three-quarters of
the state had some level of activity, although the disease was not
seen any farther west than Burke County.
"It's something that deer have been dealing with for thousands of
years," Stanford said. "It's just something that happens now and then."

Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) offices are receiving
reports of dead deer in many areas of the state. The Southeastern
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia in
Athens has analyzed samples from these deer. The diagnosis is no
surprise. Testing has confirmed that the deer are dying of EHD
(Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease).
EHD is no surprise because it occurs regularly in Tennessee,
according to TWRA officials. Some years, there is virtually no sign
of EHD, and others, like this year [2007], it seems to be everywhere.
Reports to TWRA offices indicate mortality of deer in at least 30
counties with more expected as the season progresses.
"What makes this year [2007] a little alarming is that the reports
started coming in early August, several weeks earlier than usual,"
said Daryl Ratajczak, TWRA Big Game Coordinator.
"We most often start getting the dead deer reports in the last week
of August and 1st part of September," said Roger Applegate, TWRA
Wildlife Disease Coordinator.
"However, the most important thing for hunters, landowners, and the
public to know is that this is a regular and natural event that
routinely afflicts white-tailed deer and that it is not transmissible
to humans or any other animals. The public also need not be overly
concerned about the fate of the deer, because any reduction in deer
numbers in a local area will easily be made up within a couple of years."
White-tailed deer have adapted to EHD. Does that survive an infection
of the EHD virus will pass along immunity to their fawns and foster
an increase in immunity for several years before another die-off occurs.
The EHD disease cycle begins with the virus being transmitted to deer
by a midge; a small biting fly that humans recognize as "no-see-ums."
The virus causes depression, fever, respiratory distress, and
swelling of the neck or tongue. Those deer that survive these ills
may slowly lose appetite and/or become lame which could last for
several weeks before the deer die or shake off the disease.
"Due to the already stressful conditions caused by the drought, we
can expect to see die-offs as high as 40 percent in some highly
localized areas," said Applegate.
"Although it is unfortunate, EHD die-offs are part of a completely
natural cycle that has been occurring for eons. The deer obviously
deal with it, we must deal with it as well," said Ratajczak.

The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, along with the Southeastern
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study at the University of Georgia, has
confirmed that EHD (Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease) is the cause of
death of a large population of Tennessee's Whitetail deer. At least
30 counties have reported large numbers of dead deer. The reports
come from all across the state, with the highest numbers
concentrating in the Northern areas of Middle Tennessee.
TWRA officials issued a press release stating that EHD has long been
an issue in Tennessee, yet some years, there are virtually no reports
of whitetail deaths due to this disease. Officials express concern
that due to the extreme heat and dry weather experienced in Tennessee
over the summer [2007], cases were reported in higher numbers and
occurred much earlier in the year than normal.
Disease Coordinator, Roger Applegate was quoted as saying: "However,
the most important thing for hunters, landowners, and the public to
know is that this is a regular and natural event that routinely
afflicts white-tailed deer and that it is not transmissible to humans
or any other animals." He also said there should be little concern
about Tennessee's deer population, as whatever toll this disease
takes on the whitetail deer population would be reversed within 2 to 3 years.
EHD is a disease caused by a virus transmitted to the deer through
the bite of a fly. Deer that contract the disease suffer from
respiratory problems, swelling of the neck and tongue, fever and
depression. Deer who survive the disease will experience a prolonged
recovery period. Researchers believe that females who survive the
disease may pass an immunity to the disease to their future
offspring, which will aid in protecting the population in future years.
TWRA reports that the mortality rate in some areas of the state is
nearly 40 percent of the deer population in those areas. TWRA request
that hunters and landowners report any dead deer suspected of dying
of EHD. There was no word on the effect the high number of deaths
would take on the upcoming deer season.
Tennessee taxidermist Don Russell told reporters, "We will see in a
few months the effect the disease really has had on the deer
population. The number of deer brought into my shop will tell the real story."

Kentucky wildlife officials say epizootic hemorrhagic disease -- a
fairly common ailment that affects whitetail deer -- now has been
reported across more than half the state.
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, is transmitted from deer to
deer by biting gnats or midges. It is nearly always fatal, and
infected deer usually die within 72 hours.
Danny Watson, a biologist and disease specialist for the Department
of Fish and Wildlife Resources, said EHD doesn't affect humans or
livestock but noted that bluetongue -- a virus closely related to EHD
-- can affect cattle and some other livestock.
"There's a lot that's not known about EHD," he said. "But the spread
of the disease from deer to livestock or from livestock to deer has
never been documented. Bluetongue can affect livestock. (Bluetongue)
and EHD are related, but the important thing to remember is that they
are genetically distinct virus strains."
What is known with certainty is that hemorrhagic disease is hard on
whitetails. Watson has received reports of deer from 76 counties that
were confirmed or strongly suspected of having died from EHD.
"That was as of last Monday [10 Sep 2007]," he said. "I'm sure there
are more than that now. This is the worst outbreak we've had in
Kentucky in 30 years. It's certainly the worst that I've seen in my career."
Watson said state game managers usually see outbreaks of EHD every 5
to 7 years. The last one of consequence was in 2003. Cases are
typically isolated; 2 or 3 adjoining counties may report deer that
apparently have died from the disease. This year's [2007] outbreak
covers large chunks of Central and Western Kentucky.
"This is much more widespread than what we usually see," Watson said.
A swath around the Green River and the Purchase region have been hit
particularly hard. Officials have received reports from landowners of
more than 700 dead deer in those areas.
The severity of this EHD outbreak has biologists somewhat baffled,
but Watson suspects the drought has played a major part.
"For one thing, the drought has produced better habitat for the
midges that spread EHD," he said.
Drought also tends to concentrate deer near water, which makes them
more susceptible to the disease-carrying midges, according to Dr.
Karen Alexy, director of the department's wildlife division.
The virus apparently can be spread only from live deer and not from
an infected carcass. Officials say EHD is not a threat to humans, and
eating meat from a deer that appears to be healthy poses no risk even
if the animal actually has EHD. However, they advise against eating
any deer that appears unhealthy for any reason.
How many deer actually have died from EHD this year [2007] is unknown
because officials see only a small fraction of those that do succumb.
Kentucky's statewide herd has grown to around 950 000 deer.
Watson said hunters might see some isolated pockets where deer
numbers have been noticeably reduced by the disease. Such was the
case in Hardin County in 2003.
"Typically, less than 25 percent of a localized population will
succumb to the disease," Watson said. "Some reports that we got from
hunters in 2003 from Hardin County said they didn't see a difference
in the number of deer from the previous year, but some hunters in
another part of the county said they didn't see any deer at all in
areas where they usually hunt."
That was also an extraordinary circumstance. EHD also had been
reported in Hardin County in 2002 and 2003.
"We had had 2 outbreaks in Hardin County in a row," Watson recalled.
"That's unheard of."
He concluded that nothing can slow or stop the current outbreak
except a change in the weather. The 1st hard freeze will kill the
midges and gnats that spread the disease.

Dr. Walter Cottrell, Pennsylvania Game Commission wildlife
veterinarian, announced last week that the test result from an adult
female deer has confirmed that epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD)
has been found in Beaver County.
"This outbreak of EHD is more significant than the one in 2002, as it
occurred earlier in the year and has impacted more deer in a larger
area," Cottrell said. "In addition, the fact that we are finding EHD
earlier this year [2007] means that it will take longer before the
1st good frost, which is what is needed to kill the insects
responsible for spreading the virus.
"Though difficult to determine the precise number of deer that have
died due to EHD because of the rapid decomposition of dead deer, we
have our officers' observations and those of concerned citizens that
suggest that the number is in excess of 1000 animals at this time and
could increase. Rapid decomposition of affected deer and the large
area that is affected will continue to make an actual body count impractical."
Cottrell noted that additional samples from deer found dead in
Allegheny, Beaver, Cambria, Washington and Westmoreland counties have
been submitted for testing. Residents with information about other
sick or dead deer are urged to contact the Southwest Region Office at
(724) 238-9523.
So far, EHD has been confirmed throughout Greene County; West Finley,
East Finley, South Franklin, Morris, Amwell, West Bethlehem and
Marianna townships in Washington County; and Greene, Hanover,
Raccoon, Industry, Potter, Ohioville, South Beaver, Wanport,
Shippingport, Midland, Glasgow, Georgetown, Hookstown, Independence,
Center and Brighton townships in Beaver County.
"There is no doubt that hunter success and satisfaction will be
reduced in those local areas hardest hit by EHD," said Matthew Hough,
game commission Southwest Region director. "But, WMU 2A is a large
area with a lot of deer. Hunters should consider moving out of those
local areas that are hit the hardest and hunt the areas of WMU 2A
that have not been hit or have reduced mortalities from this outbreak.
"Also, hunters and other wildlife enthusiasts should take heart in
the fact that WMU 2A has good habitat, and the deer population will
rebound rapidly. Prior to this year's [2007] event, there was no
shortage of deer in those same areas, which means that the deer herd
rebounded then, and they will rebound again."
Cottrell reminded hunters that EHD cannot be contracted by humans,
and it is extremely rare for this virus to cause clinical signs in
traditional livestock, such as cattle, sheep or goats; however,
farmed deer and elk are susceptible.
"While there is no evidence that humans can acquire this disease,
other diseases may be transmitted by careless hygiene when processing
deer. As a routine precaution, all hunters are encouraged to wear
rubber or latex gloves when handling or field-dressing any animal and
wash their hands and tools thoroughly after field dressing," Cottrell
said. "As with any wild game, meat should always be thoroughly cooked."
EHD is a common but sporadic disease in white-tailed deer populations
of the United States and is contracted by the bite of insects called
"biting midges." In more northern states, such as Pennsylvania, EHD
occurs less often, and the deer are less able to mount an effective
immune response.
The virus usually kills the naive animal within 5 to 10 days. It is
not spread from deer to deer by contact. While EHD is not infectious
to humans, deer displaying severe symptoms of EHD are usually not
suitable for consumption because of the rapid deterioration of the
meat and secondary bacterial infection.
Cottrell stressed that even though some EHD symptoms are similar to
those of chronic wasting disease (CWD) -- such as excessive drooling,
weakness and a loss of fear of humans -- there is no relationship
between EHD and CWD.
"However, because these diseases coexist, all of the deer that are
submitted are being tested for CWD," Cottrell said. "It also is worth
noting that like CWD, EHD is one of those diseases that can be
amplified by anything that serves to congregate deer, such as
supplemental feeding, and placement of salt or mineral blocks. While
the disease is not spread from deer to deer through contact,
congregating animals through feeding does make transmission easier.
Therefore, such feeding activities should be discontinued immediately."
Residents in other counties are encouraged to call their respective
regions to report dead or sick deer.

The number of white-tailed deer that have died from an outbreak of
epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, in western Pennsylvania stands
at more than 1000 and is probably still climbing.
Just this past week, Game Commission veterinarian Walt Cottrell
confirmed, as suspected, that the disease has spread from Greene and
Washington counties to 16 townships in Beaver County. Tests are
currently being run on additional dead deer collected in Allegheny,
Cambria and Westmoreland counties.
This year's [2007] EHD outbreak is much more significant than the one
that killed 70 deer in Washington and Greene counties in 2002,
Cottrell said, because it began earlier in the year and has impacted
a larger area.
The bugs that carry the disease will perish with the 1st frost, but
because that's almost assuredly a ways off yet, more deer will likely
die, Cottrell admitted.
Anyone with information of a dead deer is urged to call the
commission at 724-238-9523.
The Game Commission is going to hold a series of game lands tours
around the state, one of them in Butler County.
The free tours are meant to showcase some of the commission's habitat
work and ask questions of commission staff.
The tour in Butler and Lawrence counties will be held from 10 a.m. to
1 p.m. on 22 Sep 2007 on game lands 151. It will begin at a point
across from the lake on Mason Road, between Brent Road and Plain
Grove/North Liberty Road. A bus will be available to take tour
participants to the different areas, while the Lawrence/Beaver
Chapter of Waterfowl USA will provide a light lunch.
There will not be any tours in the commission's 10-county southwest
region area.
County treasurers will begin selling doe licenses over the counter in
wildlife management units 2B, 5C and 5D tomorrow [17 Sep 2007].
Statewide, there were just 88 440 of 865 000 tags still available,
spread over 8 units. Unit 2B had 45 766; 2A had 12 257.
Treasurers will mail regular doe licenses and 1st-round licenses back
to hunters no later than 17 Sep 2007. 2nd-round licenses will be
mailed back no later than 1 Oct 2007.

<http://www.charleston.net/news/2007/sep/16/hemorrhagic_disease_showing_up_southeast16071/>

A significant hemorrhagic disease outbreak in deer is being reported
in many Southeastern states this summer [2007], and evidence of the
disease has been seen in South Carolina. Hemorrhagic disease is the
most significant disease of deer in the Southeast.
Each year during late summer and early fall, the S.C. Department of
Natural Resources (DNR) is contacted related to an occasional sick or
dead deer that is found, according to Charles Ruth, Deer/Turkey
Project supervisor for DNR. Although there are a number of diseases
that can cause sickness and death in deer, the most likely cause
during the late summer and fall is hemorrhagic disease. The disease
is caused by certain viruses that are transmitted by biting midges or
gnats, commonly called no-see-ums. The seasonality of the disease is
related to the life cycle of these insect vectors since they thrive
during the warmer months in the Southeast.
Hunters should not confuse hemorrhagic disease with chronic wasting
disease since they are very different, Ruth said. Although chronic
wasting disease represents a significant threat to infected deer and
elk populations in North America, there is no evidence that chronic
wasting disease occurs in South Carolina. DNR has been conducting
surveillance for chronic wasting disease in South Carolina since
1998, and this surveillance will continue.
In addition to being seasonal, hemorrhagic disease appears to
flair-up about every 3-5 years. Said Ruth: "This is probably related
to the fact that once deer are exposed to the disease, they are more
resistant to it. Therefore, if you have disease one year, the deer
become exposed or inoculated to the disease, and you do not see much
disease activity until there is turnover in the deer population.
After several years, you are dealing with another cohort of deer, and
their systems are naive to the disease. The last time there was
significant hemorrhagic disease activity in South Carolina was in
2002; therefore, disease activity could be relatively high this year [2007]."
Symptoms of hemorrhagic disease include poor physical condition,
sloughing hooves, abrasions or sores on the brisket and legs, and
ulcerations on the mouth, tongue, and rumen (stomach). Actual
verification of the disease must be through laboratory analysis of
blood or certain other tissues. DNR has monitored for hemorrhagic
disease since about 1980 through an effort directed by the Southeast
Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study, part of the School of Veterinary
Medicine at the University of Georgia. Through this process, the
Southeast Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study has determined that
hemorrhagic disease is common over most of the Southeast. The
severity of hemorrhagic disease varies annually and geographically,
with cases being mild and scattered in some years while in other
years significant outbreaks and mortality can occur.
The Southeast Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study indicates that
hemorrhagic disease cases have showed up early and often this year
[2007]. Positive cases have been confirmed from Virginia, Georgia,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Indiana, and more
cases are pending including samples from South Carolina.
Deer likely die in South Carolina each year from hemorrhagic disease,
however, there is no indication that a major outbreak has occurred in
the state since the mid 1970s. The disease is part of life for deer
in the Southeast, and, fortunately, it appears that Southern deer
have acquired some immunity to the disease, said Ruth. Northern deer,
on the other hand, are not exposed to the disease as frequently,
since the insect vector is not as common in cooler climates. For this
reason, significant outbreaks and mortality from hemorrhagic disease
are more likely in northern deer populations.
Although it is important for hunters to report sick or unexplained
dead deer to DNR, there is little that can be done to prevent
hemorrhagic disease since it is spread by insects rather than from
deer to deer. As with any recommendation for disease prevention, DNR
encourages hunters to keep deer populations at reasonable levels,
which leads to overall good herd health. The disease does not pose a
threat to hunters; however, hunters should not consume deer or any
other game that appears sick or in poor condition.

[9] Ohio - EHD virus, cattle
Date: 15 Sep 2007

<http://www.coshoctontribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070915/NEWS01/709150311/1002>

According to state officials, a recent discovery of epizootic
hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in 2 Pike County cattle farms poses no
threat to human health or to the safety of eating meat.
The Ohio Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory in Reynoldsburg confirmed that some southern Ohio cattle
have contracted the virus that leads to EHD. It is typical for this
virus to appear in North American deer herds, but it is rare for
cattle to contract the disease.
This is the 1st time EHD, which is caused by a common white-tailed
deer virus, has infected cattle in Ohio. Officials say the wild
strain of the virus that was found in 2 Pike County cattle herds will
run its course much like the common flu. EHD-infected cattle will
typically recover in 2 to 3 weeks. But EHD infected dairy cattle may
not reach their pre-virus milk production level until their next lactation.
In deer however, EHD is typically fatal. Gnats or biting flies carry
and are responsible for spreading EHD. It is impossible for the virus
to spread from animal to animal or from animal to human. However,
since insects carry the virus, they can contract the disease from
infected animals and spread it to other populations.
Cattle that have contracted the virus had following signs: excessive
salivation or drooling, cloudy nasal discharge, moderate to severe
lameness and poor appetite. Dairy cattle have had a severe drop in
milk production.
Officials say that this summer's [2007] dry weather has driven
animals and insects to common watering spots, thus increasing the
spread of EHD. But, as fall starts to roll in, cold weather will
suppress the disease as frost drives insects into winter inactivity.
The most recent outbreak of EHD in Ohio deer was in 2003, found in
Clermont and Brown counties. Other species susceptible to the disease
include bighorn sheep, mule deer, elk and pronghorn antelope.
As this situation develops, the State Veterinarian's Office is
receiving reports of dead and dying deer from some other parts of the
state outside the area in which it was 1st discovered.
The USDA in Ohio would like to be notified of all cases of disease
resembling the description of EHD. This would include all species of
domestic livestock or captive deer. The telephone number for the USDA
office in Pickerington is (614) 856-4735, and the number for the
State Veterinarian's office in Reynoldsburg is (614) 728-6220.

Viral outbreaks affecting whitetail deer in several states are
routine and happen in Alabama, a state Conservation Department
official said last week.
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease and bluetongue are 2 common names of
viral strains that can infect and kill deer. Farmers and hunters
preparing for autumn seasons often find dead or infected deer in
August and September, when the diseases are at their worst.
The viruses are not harmful to humans. Tiny biting midges transmit
the viruses, primarily in spring, and the infections appear in late
summer. One symptom is a high fever, forcing deer to find water
sources; often, this is where dead deer are found.
"We have some cases every year," said Keith Guyse, a whitetail
specialist with the Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division in the
Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. "In the
Coastal Plain, the virus is there frequently enough that deer have
been exposed to it and have some resistance to it. Typically, in
North Alabama and above the fall line, they're not exposed to it as
often. So, over a period of time, you have a population that doesn't
have much resistance. When you have (outbreaks) up there, it tends to
be more noticeable."
According to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, in deer, the viruses can cause
infection, swelling and hemorrhaging of the mucous membranes of the
mouth, nose, tongue and feet. The EDH viruses most frequently are
found in the South and Southwest.
Animals can't directly contract the disease from other animals. The
mysterious midges are the culprits.
"Auburn (researchers) had traps out to catch the flies, and they
might catch a few every once in a while, and then all of a sudden
they catch hundreds," Guyse said. "Much of that still is a mystery."
EHD outbreaks have been reported in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Illinois,
Ohio, Montana and Tennessee.

[Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) is certainly making its presence
known this year 2007. This posting alone details a continuing
increasing number of animals affected. This disease is closely
related to bluetongue virus, but they are separate diseases. However,
as noted in the posting from Ohio, cattle can be affect by EHD, just
