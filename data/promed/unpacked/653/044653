Lassa fever has claimed the lives of 8 people in Jega local government area of Kebbi State, while 3 others are still undergoing medical treatment at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Birnin Kebbi. A nurse at the FMC, Birnin Kebbi, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they received the cases on Wed 27 Feb 2013 and that 3 people were confirmed dead on the spot, while 2 others died the following day.

The nurse further explained that on Friday [29 Feb 2013] 5 people were brought from the same local government, and one died in the night; another one passed away the following day, while the remaining 3 people are still undergoing medical treatment. "I was on duty on Wednesday [27 Feb 2013] when they brought them, and they were admitted in the A and E ward before they were taken to the main ward. You know, it is an airborne disease. The state government took care of their drugs free of charge," he said. One of the relatives of the deceased said that, initially, they assumed it was poison that had afflicted them, but on coming to the hospital, they discovered that it was Lassa fever. Efforts to contact the state commissioner of health, Alhaji Shehu Sambawa, were unsuccessful, as his line could not be reached.

[Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases were found. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animalborne. In areas of Africa where the disease is endemic, Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case fatality rate may reach 50 per cent.

According to the CDC Special Pathogens website (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm): The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with about 5000 deaths. The reservoir of Lassa virus is a rodent known as the "multimammate rat", belonging to the genus _Mastomys_. _Mastomys_ spp. rodents breed very frequently, produce large numbers of offspring, and are numerous in the savannas and forests of West, Central, and East Africa. _Mastomys_ rodents readily colonize human homes.

About 15-20 per cent of patients hospitalized for Lassa fever die from the illness. However, overall, only about one per cent of infections with Lassa virus result in death. The death rates are particularly high for women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy and for fetuses, about 95 per cent of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers. Ribavirin, an antiviral drug, has been used with success in treatment of Lassa fever patients. It has been shown to be most effective when given early in the course of the illness. Otherwise, patients should receive supportive care consisting of maintenance of appropriate fluid and electrolyte balance, oxygenation, and blood pressure, as well as treatment of any other complicating infections.

Previously, ProMED-mail reported that 22 local government areas in 9 states of Nigeria had reported outbreaks of Lassa fever. Kebbi may be the 10th state.
