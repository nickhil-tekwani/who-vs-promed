Statement by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the
National Institutes of Health (NIH)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A study published this week in the Archives of Internal Medicine ["Impact
of Influenza Vaccination on Seasonal Mortality in the US Elderly
Population" by Simonsen et al. (2005)] reports that vaccination of the
elderly population against influenza may be less effective in preventing
death among the elderly than previously assumed. This study's findings have
caused some confusion about whether people 65 years old and older should
receive an influenza vaccination.
CDC and NIH continue to support the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) recommendation that people aged 65 and older get
vaccinated against influenza each year. People aged 65 and older are at
highest risk for complications, hospitalizations, and deaths from
influenza. Vaccination remains the best protection from influenza available
for people 65 and older and their loved ones.
Numerous studies have shown that influenza vaccination works -- including
to help protect the elderly from serious illness and hospitalizations --
but the degree to which it works varies from year to year and can be
difficult to measure. For example, influenza seasons differ each year in
length and severity, and the health status of individuals also matters.
In the current study by Simonsen et al, the authors in no way imply that
the elderly should not receive influenza vaccine. Rather, the study
concludes that the vaccine may prevent fewer deaths among the elderly than
previous studies would have suggested. Therefore, the authors note that
there is room for improvement in influenza prevention efforts, including
research into developing more effective vaccines for the elderly and the
increased use of medicines to treat flu. In addition, recently published
studies raise the possibility that it may be beneficial to vaccinate larger
numbers of healthy persons, including children, to prevent transmission of
influenza viruses to high-risk persons such as the elderly.
Expansion of groups for whom influenza vaccination is recommended is under
discussion by the ACIP and CDC, and is partly contingent on adequate
vaccine supply in the future. The CDC and ACIP continually review their
influenza vaccine recommendations as well as studies and published research
in order to develop the best recommendations for protecting all Americans
from influenza. This study is a reminder that there is room for improvement
in how we protect the elderly from influenza, and CDC and NIH encourage
research that strengthens our ability to do so.

[Another reason for the apparent relatively poor performance of influenza
virus vaccines in the elderly is semantic. Any febrile infection is
described initially as flu-like and, in the case of upper respiratory tract
infections, the assumption is that (in the absence of laboratory diagnosis)
the infection is caused by influenza virus. Whereas in the elderly in some
years other respiratory tract viruses, respiratory syncytial virus in
particular, can be the cause of extensive outbreaks described as flu. - Mod.CP]
