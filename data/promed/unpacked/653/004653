[Serbia has been the source of a large outbreak of Trichinella in France in
1998 and cases in the UK in 2000 from privately imported meat from Serbia.
The present outbreak shows that Trichinella is still not under control. We
assume that the infection comes from pigs or horse meat for consumption and
not wild game, but information on the source of the infection would be
appreciated. - Mod.EP]
