Angola: Death Toll from Mystery Fever Rises
-------------------------------------------
An outbreak of an unidentified haemorrhagic fever has claimed the
lives of 93 people in northern Angola, Deputy Minister of Health Jose
van Dunem said late on Mon 21 Mar 2005. Of the 101 cases reported in
the Uige provincial hospital in northern Angola, 93 people have died
and 2 have left the hospital without being properly discharged, said
Van Dunem at a news conference. "We are engaged in an effort with the
community to find the 2 patients who fled the hospital and to detect
new cases," he said.
The results of blood samples sent to Senegal showed that the
mysterious outbreak was not due to yellow fever, dengue fever, West
Nile virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever or Rift Valley fever,
said Moises Francisco, a member of the Angolan technical team
monitoring the outbreak in Uige. Angolan health officials have asked
the Centers for Disease Control in the United States to conduct tests
to determine whether the fever is caused by Ebola virus. "We have the
results [from Senegal] and they are negative," said Van Dunem. "We
are now awaiting the results of the Ebola tests that we have asked
from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta."
Angolan health officials said that 8 cases of haemorrhagic fever were
detected in municipalities near the city of Uige. The officials last
week gave the death toll at 87 from November 2004 to mid-March 2005.
Health officials last week said they did not believe that they were
dealing with an outbreak of Ebola, fever which kills by inducing
massive internal haemorrhages. Most of those affected by the disease
are children aged under 5 years, according to the World Health
Organisation (WHO). The WHO has expressed concern over the fact that
children are the main victims, saying that in general haemorrhagic
fevers, such as the one caused by the Ebola virus, hit all age groups
without distinction. "We're perplexed. We don't know if it's Ebola
fever or something else," said Fadela Chaib in Geneva.
The Portuguese health authorities on Mon 21 Mar 2005 advised its
citizens against travelling to northern Angola due to the outbreak.

[Most of the common haemorrhagic fever-associated viruses appear to
have been excluded as causative agents of this outbreak, other than
Lassa fever virus. The results of laboratory tests for the
filoviruses, Ebola virus and Marburg virus, are still pending,
although the involvement of these viruses is now less likely due to
the disproportionate involvement of children. Lassa fever virus is
endemic in parts of West Africa to the north, but it has not been
recorded in Angola. Although a recent outbreak of Lassa fever in
Sierra Leone did affect children disproportionately, many of the
cases were attributed to nosocomial transmission in a hospital. -
