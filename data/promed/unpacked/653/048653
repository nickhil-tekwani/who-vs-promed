The Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Central-Epicure Food Products Limited are warning the public to not consume 2 of their gefilte fish brands. The Central-Epicure Ready to Serve Sweet and Ready to Serve Savoury gefilte fish products may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_; toxins produced by these bacteria can cause botulism, a life-threatening illness.

The fish was sold in Ontario and Quebec in 600 gram packages with a best before date of 13 Apr 2013 (UPC code 061279 00440 3 & 061279 00440 7). There have been no illnesses reported in association with the product.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Gefilte fish (from the Yiddidh for stuffed fish) is an Eastern European Jewish dish made from a poached mixture of ground boned fish, such as carp, whitefish or pike, which is typically eaten as an appetizer. Although the dish historically consisted of a minced-fish forcemeat stuffed inside the fish skin, as its name implies, since the 19th century, the skin has commonly been omitted, and the seasoned fish is formed into patties similar to quenelles or fish balls. They are popular on Shabbat and Holidays such as Passover, although they may be consumed throughout the year. - Mod.LL
