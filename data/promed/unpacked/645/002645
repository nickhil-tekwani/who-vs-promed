The Interim Director of the area Ramon Carrillo Hospital, Guillermo
Di Lisio, discarded [the idea] that the quantity of cases attended in
the hospital could be considered an outbreak. So far this year
[2010], there have been 2 cases, one of which was fatal. He defended
the action of the physicians who attended the [fatal] case.

Di Liso, in an interview with ANB, explained that the hantavirus
[infection] symptoms "could present with the most serious effects in
just a few hours," defending the intervention of the professionals
who attended the patient under their care in the hospital last
Saturday [3 Apr 2010]. "I doubt that had the patient presented with a
bloody cough that they would have let him leave the hospital," he
stated, in response to the statement of the family of the youth who
died on Monday [5 Apr 2010]. The family indicated that on Saturday [3
Apr 2010], he presented with symptoms of a disease more serious than
that of a simple cold.

Di Liso also explained that so far this year [2010], they have seen 2
hanta [virus infections]; the 1st was an infection of an 11-year-old,
who is out of danger, and the 2nd which relates to this [present]
case. "We are within the logical percentage [incidence] for an
endemic area like this one," he stated and discarded any
possibilities that these [case] numbers imply an outbreak.

[As indicated in ProMED-mail archive no. 20060822.2370, hantaviruses
in South America are maintained in sigmodontine rodents. Several
hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina.
The most likely hantavirus involved in this case is Andes virus,
endemic in Bariloche in the mountains of western Argentina. The
long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_ is the reservoir host.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), can be seen at <http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg>.

The CDC has an excellent Power Point presentation on hantaviruses
available at

In Antofagasta, The health authority confirmed the death of a
29-year-old patient affected [infected] by [a] hantavirus, according
to a report on the Antofagasta El Murcurio web site. The young man,
who worked for some years in a mining company, contracted the fatal
disease during a trip to Biobio, where his family members live. When
he returned to the city, the worker had the 1st symptoms of the
disease, which led to his admission to a private [medical] assistance
center, where he rapidly became worse and finally died on Wednesday
last week [31 Mar 2010].

Hantaviruses are transmitted through contact with wild rodents or
their feces and have a case fatality rate greater than 30 percent.
Jorge Caceres, Chief of the SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat]
of Health, said that the viruses are not transmitted person-to-person
(it is necessary to have contact with the rodent or its feces), and
discarded any relationship with the cholera or norovirus outbreak
that affects the city.

[The hantavirus involved most likely is Andes virus. If it is, then
the above statement in the report is incorrect. Andes virus is the
only Western Hemisphere hantavirus that is transmitted directly
between people who are in very close contact, usually family members.
