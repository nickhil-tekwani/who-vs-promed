[1] Case update
- 21 Jun 2018. Epidemiological situation. Democratic Republic of Congo, Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=7cc70086bf

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 20 Jun 2018:
- a total of 61 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable and 9 suspected;
- 4 new suspected cases, including 2 in Bikoro and 2 in Iboko;
- 4 samples were negative;
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola virus disease since the beginning of the epidemic;
- no deaths reported so far [28 deaths reported to date];
- no new cases confirmed.

Epidemiological analyzes have identified contacts living in nearby health areas in Bikoro and Iboko. These contacts are followed and advised to limit their movements during the entire follow-up period of 21 days.

Remarks
- Negative tests are systematically removed from the summary table.
- The category of probable cases includes all reported deaths for which it was not possible to obtain biological samples for laboratory confirmation.

News from the Ebola response
Vaccination
- Since the launch of the vaccination on 21 May 2018, 3199 people have been vaccinated, including 836 in Mbandaka, 779 in Bikoro, 1464 in Iboko, 107 in Ingende, and 13 in Kinshasa.

Leopards against Ebola
- On Thu 21 Jun 2018, the coach of the national football team, Florent Ibenge, the former professional football player Aziz Makukula, and the African champion of karate, Master Nancy Tshiaba, went to Mbandaka and Itipo with the Ministry of Health to raise awareness about Ebola as part of the 'Leopards against Ebola' campaign.
- In Itipo, they were greeted with fanfare by the people who accompanied them to the football field to attend a shootout contest between 2 local teams. Coach Ibenge and Aziz Makukula handed the 2 teams a set of autographed T-shirts, caps, and footballs. Master Tshiba took the opportunity to give a demonstration of karate to the young people present.
- Athletes also exchanged with members of the National Association of Ebola Winners (ANVE) who spoke about the stigma they still face in the community. The presence of these celebrities alongside the winners has sent a strong message to the community to show that Ebola survivors are not a danger.
- Our guests were keen to support the local medical teams who have been working hard for more than a month to contain the Ebola outbreak. They offered a batch of drugs at the Itipo Ebola Treatment Center. Before leaving for Mbandaka, they stopped for a moment to watch with the Itipo teams part of the match of the World Cup Denmark vs. Australia.
- The Leopards congratulated the population of Itipo for their collaboration with the health authorities and encouraged them to continue to respect hygiene measures to put an end to the Ebola outbreak.

[The statistics in this report for 20 Jun 2018 are basically the same as those reported for 19 Jun 2018 (https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=2b11da2cfa, not posted). There is no indication of the etiologic agent of the suspected cases that prove not to be Ebola. It is not clear if diagnosis is carried out further beyond Ebola/not Ebola.

The visit by the national football team was a very generous gesture of reassurance that Ebola survivors do not present a risk to the community. Anything that helps lift the stigma the survivors experience must be highly appreciated. An interesting statement is made that [the guests] "offered a batch of drugs at the Itipo Ebola Treatment Center." One has to wonder exactly what drugs were offered, especially in light of the report by Helen Branswell (below in STAT News) that none of the Ebola antivirals were actually ever used because of the outbreak curve. - Mod.LK]

[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/20-june-2018-ebola-drc/en/

The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There is cautious optimism. Slightly over a month into the response, further spread of EVD has largely been contained. However, in spite of progress, there should be no room for laxity and complacency until the outbreak is controlled. The focus of operations remains on intensive surveillance and active case finding.

Since 17 May 2018, no new confirmed EVD cases have been reported in Bikoro and Wangata health zones, while the last confirmed case-patient in Iboko developed symptoms on 2 Jun and died on 9 Jun 2018 (Figure 1 [figures available at the source URL above]).

From 1 Apr through 18 Jun 2018, a total of 60 EVD cases(1), including 28 deaths, have been reported from 4 health zones in Equateur province. The total includes 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 8 suspected cases. Cases have been confirmed from 3 health zones: Bikoro (n=24; 10 confirmed, 11 probable, and 3 suspected cases), Iboko (n=32; 24 confirmed, 3 probable, and 5 suspected cases), Wangata (n=4; all confirmed) (Figure 2). 5 cases were health care workers, of which 4 were confirmed cases and 2 died. Of 1706 contacts of cases registered to date, 244 contacts remain under active follow up as of 18 Jun 2018.

Figure 2: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ebola cases per Health Zone in Equateur province from 4 Apr through 18 Jun 2018 (n=60)

Public health response
The Ministry of Health (MoH) is leading the response in the affected health zones with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the strengthening of surveillance and contract tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), case management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination and vaccination. Additionally, to avoid the spread of the disease from affected provinces to non-affected provinces and to other countries, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has put into place cross-border surveillance at points of entry (neighbouring at-risk zones, provinces, countries, and at important travellers' congregation points). WHO continues to work closely with the Ministries of Health from 9 neighbouring countries to strengthen preparedness in order to mitigate the risk of international spread.

Since the launch of the vaccination intervention on 21 May through 17 Jun 2018, a total of 3137 people have been vaccinated in Iboko (1434) Wangata (834), Bikoro (779), Ingende (77), and Kinshasa (13). Populations eligible for ring vaccination include front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed EVD cases (contacts) and contacts of contacts.

Active surveillance activities are ongoing, including daily follow-up of contacts of cases, active case search at community and health facility levels, real-time investigation of alerts, and laboratory testing of all suspected cases to confirm or exclude EVD.

Infection prevention and control supplies, including personal protective equipment and disinfectants, have been provided to health facilities in 8 health areas, namely: Mapeke, Bokongo, Itipo, Londo, Bokando-Bouna, Mpangi, Lokango, and Boutela.

Community awareness activities continue in Iboko, Bikoro, Mbandaka Wangata, and Bolenge. In Iboko, more than 140 households were visited this week. Cellule d'Animation Communautaire (CAC) teams conducted house-to-house visits in Bokongo, Mapeke, B.Buna, and Loondo health areas. In Mbandaka, awareness raising activities was carried out in ports and small markets along the river. Community awareness involving street leaders is also being carried out in Mbandaka, Wangata, and Bolenge, where rumours and community concerns are being addressed.

WHO is providing technical advice on the use of investigational therapeutics under the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions (MEURI) framework and provision of essential medical supplies. Four of the 5 investigational therapeutics are in-country and all protocols have been approved by the Ethics Review Board (ERB). This is the first time such treatments have been available during an Ebola outbreak.

As of 18 Jun 2018, WHO has deployed a total of 271 technical experts in various critical functions of the Incident Management System (IMS) to support response to the EVD outbreak, including 31 experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions. A WHO anthropologist and risk communication experts have trained Ebola responders on community engagement, including safe burial and contact tracing.

As of 19 Jun 2018, 26 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from Democratic Republic of the Congo, but there are currently no restrictions of international traffic in place. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event.

A joint partnership project was initiated by WHO, IOM, IFRC, UNHCR, and other partners to reinforce cross border coordination activities between the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Congo, and the Central African Republic.

As of 19 Jun 2018, no cases were detected at ports on the River Congo closed to Kinshasa (Muluku, Kinkolé, Ngobila) as well as in the international and main national airports in Kinshasa (Ndili, Ndolo). As of 16 Jun 2018, 9716 travelers were screened, in Mbandaka, 538 travellers in Irebu, and 100 travelers in Iboko.

As of 20 Jun 2018 no exported case was reported. The risk of missed cases able to travel outside of Equateur province and internationally during the incubation period (2-21 days) was considered very low. However, it was decided to maintain exit screening at points of entry and congregation sites as a precautionary measure and to prepare a deactivation plan for after the end of the outbreak.

WHO is supporting neighbouring countries to systematically assess and take action on Ebola preparedness, and to develop national contingency response plans. A regional readiness and preparedness plan has been developed and published, outlining activities to ensure that the nine neighbouring countries can detect and contain Ebola should it be introduced. The regional readiness and preparedness plan requires USD 15.5 million.

WHO risk assessment
WHO considers the public health risk to be very high at the national level due to the serious nature of the disease, insufficient epidemiological information, and the delay in the detection of initial cases, which makes it difficult to assess the magnitude and geographical extent of the outbreak.

WHO has assessed the public health risk to be high at the regional level. 9 neighbouring countries, including the Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, have been advised that they are at high risk of spread, and preparedness activities are being undertaken.

At the global level the risk currently remains low. This risk assessment is continuously being reviewed as further information becomes available.

WHO advice
The International Health Regulations Emergency Committee was convened by the WHO Director-General on 18 May 2018, and advised against the application of any travel or trade restrictions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo in relation to the current Ebola outbreak. Flight cancellations and other travel restrictions may hinder the international public health response and may cause significant economic damage to the affected country. The Emergency Committee also advised that exit screening, including at airports and ports on the Congo river, is considered to be of great importance. However, entry screening, particularly in distant airports, is not considered to be of any public health or cost-benefit value. Although the Emergency Committee stated that the conditions for a PHEIC [public health emergency of international concern] are not currently met, the Committee issued comprehensive public health advice(2).

WHO travel advice was issued on 29 May 2018(3), aiming to sensitize travellers on how to reduce the risk of exposure and where to obtain appropriate medical assistance in case of EVD like symptoms after possible exposure , considering the risk of an international traveller becoming infected with Ebola virus during a visit to the affected areas and developing disease after returning is low, even if the visit included travel to areas where primary cases have been reported. In addition WHO in collaboration with transport and travel partners (ICAO, IATA) are working together to increase travellers' awareness, vigilance on board of conveyances and points of entry and stress on the importance of establishing and maintaining a public health emergency contingency plan at POE in a multisectoral approach, pursuant to the IHR requirement.

[The report states that investigational therapeutics are now in-country and all protocols have been approved by the Ethics Review Board (ERB). While they were not able to be tested in this outbreak, when the next outbreak occurs, these antivirals will be in place to be implemented immediately. Other aspects of preparedness including training of personnel, raising of awareness of virus transmission, stocking of supplies, and more also seem to be in place, potentially facilitating rapid response to future outbreaks. It is important that the basic health infrastructure that has been established be maintained and not allowed to lapse into dysfunction once the outbreak is truly over. - Mod.LK]

- 21 Jun 2018. Influx of suspected, ruled-out cases continues in DRC Ebola outbreak
[Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/06/news-scan-jun-21-2018

In the latest development in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak, the country's health ministry yesterday [20 Jun 2018] reported 3 new suspected cases in Bikoro, 1 of the 2 remote hotspots, according to a daily update.

Tests on earlier suspected cases ruled out 2 infections, which puts the overall total at 61 cases, including 38 confirmed, 14 probable, and 9 suspected illnesses. The fatality count held steady at 28.

A vaccination campaign in the affected area continues with the experimental VSV-EBOV vaccine, and so far 3139 people have been immunized, the vast majority of them in Iboko and Bikoro, the 2 locations in the forested region where most of the illnesses have occurred.

The last confirmed case-patient became ill on 2 Jun 2018. Though the number of lab-confirmed cases has tapered off, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [20 Jun 2018] in an outbreak update that the trend is promising, "However, in spite of progress, there should be no room for laxity and complacency until the outbreak is controlled. The focus of operations remains on intensive surveillance and active case finding."

- 21 Jun 2018. Health officials cautiously optimistic dangerous Ebola outbreak is over
[STAT News, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/06/21/ebola-outbreak-optimism
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

There is cautious optimism that a dangerous Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is over, the head of the World Health Organization's emergency response operations said [Thu 21 Jun 2108].

Transmission of the deadly virus appears to have stopped -- though it is not yet time to pull back on the response operation, Dr Peter Salama, deputy director-general for emergency preparedness and response, told STAT.

"Overall I'd be very confident that we've broken the back of this outbreak," Salama said, noting that the WHO will discuss with the DRC government in coming days how long to maintain response operations and when to think about declaring the outbreak over.

While there have been 28 fatalities due to Ebola, there hasn't been a newly confirmed diagnosis since early June [2018]. And while surveillance teams keep finding and testing people who are sick, time and again tests have shown that what ails them is not Ebola.

Typically infectious disease outbreaks are declared over when there hasn't been a new case for 2 full incubation periods of the particular disease. Ebola's incubation period is 2-21 days, so 42 days is the bare minimum. As of [Thu 21 Jun 2018], 19 days had passed without a new case.

But the WHO is likely to be cautious, particularly in light of the West African Ebola outbreak that ran from late 2013-2016. That epidemic appeared to be coming under control in 2015 and 2016, and on several occasions the WHO declared the outbreak over in one of the affected countries. Then a cluster of new cases would be spotted.

Investigation of the new cases brought to light that a phenomenon previously thought to be mainly a theoretical risk: The Ebola virus persisted in some survivors for weeks and in some cases even months -- notably in eyeballs and testicles -- often reigniting spread of the disease.

Investigations found most of the new cases were linked to sexual contact with a survivor; mother-to-infant transmission via breast milk was seen in one case.

The same kind of risks "mustn't be underestimated" in the latest outbreak, said Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of Britain's Wellcome Trust, one of the 1st entities to step up to help fund this outbreak response.

"You would hate to declare it over prematurely," he said, noting that having to unwind operations and rebuild them later would be difficult and would undermine morale.

The use of an experimental Ebola vaccine in the outbreak may diminish the risk of straggler cases, or even sexually transmitted infections from survivors, however.

The vaccine, being developed by Merck, was offered to health care workers as well as the contacts of cases -- and their contacts -- in what's called a ring vaccination approach. The idea is to stop spread of the virus by protecting anyone who might be at risk of contracting it.
Acceptance of the vaccine was astonishingly high -- almost everyone offered a chance to be vaccinated took it. Salama said in 9 of 11 vaccination rings, all the people offered the vaccine agreed to be vaccinated. In the other 2 rings, 98 percent agreed. "It was really heartening," he said.

It is too early to say for sure, but Salama believes the vaccination effort helped to contain the outbreak, which involved spread in 3 locations -- the city of Mbandaka, on the Congo River, the town of Bikoro, and the village of Iboko.

"Just eyeballing the data, the fact that these outbreaks really stopped in their tracks ... to me is suggestive that the vaccination had some impact," he said. Salama noted infections dried up despite the fact that contact tracing -- finding people who had been exposed to cases to monitor them for signs of Ebola -- only really got to high levels late in May [2018]. That is about a week after vaccination began in Mbandaka and around the time it started in Bikoro and Iboko.

The outbreak post-mortems will include an effort to explore the question more fully, Salama said. Scientists will look at when contacts of cases were exposed to sick people and then when they were vaccinated to try to discern if the vaccine may have prevented infections.

"We'll know more on that when we do more modeling post-outbreak with the full data set," Salama said. "But for the regular transmission, certainly that's extremely likely. And even [to prevent] sexual transmission, it's possible."

None of the experimental Ebola therapies shipped to DRC ended up being used in this outbreak. By the time the country's scientific and ethics advisory committees had studied the drugs and agreed they would be administered, there were no patients left to treat. "It is a lost opportunity," Salama acknowledged.

But he noted that in a small 2017 outbreak in DRC, the same thing happened with a proposal to use the experimental vaccine. The groundwork laid then led to quicker approval of the vaccine this time, he said, and the review of the experimental drugs in this outbreak could speed approvals the next time DRC -- on its 9th Ebola outbreak -- has to fight this disease. "For next time, I think it will happen much quickly," Salama said.

ref: Suder E, Furuyama W, Feldmann H, et al. The vesicular stomatitis virus-based Ebola virus vaccine: From concept to clinical trials. Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2018; 14:1-7.

Abstract. The devastating Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic in West Africa in 2013-2016 accelerated the progress of several vaccines and antivirals through clinical trials, including the replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus-based vaccine expressing the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-EBOV). Extensive preclinical testing in animal models demonstrated the prophylactic and post-exposure efficacy of this vaccine, identified the mechanism of protection, and suggested it was safe for human use. Based on these data, VSV-EBOV was extensively tested in phase 1-3 clinical trials in North America, Europe and Africa. Although some side effects of vaccination were observed, these clinical trials showed that the VSV-EBOV was safe and immunogenic in humans. Moreover, the data supported the use of VSV-EBOV as an emergency vaccine in individuals at risk for Ebola virus disease. In this review, we summarize the results of the extensive preclinical and clinical testing of the VSV-EBOV vaccine.

100 percent of monkeys infected with the Ebola virus were cured after treatment with antibody 114, an experimental treatment developed by the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB). The Director General of this Institute, Dr Muyembe said [Wed 20 Jun 2018], at the opening of the IX International Congress on Infectious and Parasitic Pathologies, held in Lubumbashi [DRC] with the theme: "Infectious Diseases, Comorbidities, Global Health and environment."

"We know better and better the pathogen and we have developed a treatment. So far, it's still [in the experimental phase]. It is called the 114 antibody, when we inject it into monkeys that are infected and that make the disease Ebola, 100 percent cure ", said Dr Muyembe, who said the research is promising.

The director general added that the next step in this research is the injection of antibody 114 into humans to track their response to infected people.

"Now it's the passage to take this antibody and use it in humans. If it works in the man at the moment we will say that we have total control of this epidemic, " he said.

The Rector of UNILU [University of Lubumbashi] acknowledged that the congress on infectious diseases is an asset to bring remedies and solutions to the Ebola crisis, which is still a plural and multifaceted crisis. Beyond Ebola, delegates will also reflect on other infectious diseases including malaria, HIV AIDS, and the strain of sleeping sickness.

The conference, which opened [Wed 20 Jun 2018], ends [Fri 22 Jun 2018]. It is organized by the INRB, in collaboration with the University of Lubumbashi. Researchers from the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, and some cities in the DRC are taking part.

[3] Preparedness
- 21 Jun 2018. Ebola outbreak - this time it's different
[Horizon Magazine, edited]
https://horizon.scienceblog.com/331/ebola-outbreak-this-time-its-different/
[Byline: Gary Finnegan]

Lessons learned from past Ebola epidemics are helping to combat a fresh outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Investing in new vaccines, diagnostic tests, and laboratories is paying off as expert networks spring into action.

A new Ebola epidemic in the DRC has killed at least 28 people since April [2018] but a situation report from the World Health Organization (WHO) on [19 Jun 2018] says they are monitoring the outbreak with cautious optimism.

The contrast with the 2013-16 outbreak in West Africa is stark. That epidemic killed more than 11 000 people and prompted criticism of local and global health organisations for taking too long to get the outbreak under control.

This time, when Ebola struck, the world was better prepared. Over the past 2 years, networks of researchers and health workers have been established, lab infrastructure has been built up, and vaccines have been fast-tracked through research and development and the regulatory system, helped by a global network of funders in preparedness research called GloPID-R [Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness].

However, the danger has not yet passed. Just a week earlier, when visiting Kinshasa, capital of the DRC, on 12 Jun 2018, WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said: 'Even if one case ... gets to an urban area, that could trigger another epidemic.'

The big fear is that the virus could reach Kinshasa -- home to around 10 million people -- or the nearby city of Brazzaville in the neighbouring Republic of Congo. These populous cities would give the virus an opportunity to quickly infect large numbers of people and to spread through transport networks to other parts of Africa. Experts who have traced the spread of HIV in the 20th century found that Kinshasa's railways played a key role in the explosive spread of the disease.

The previous West African epidemic prompted much soul-searching among global health figures and the research community. This spurred renewed investment in networks of scientists tasked with preparing the region for future outbreaks of Ebola and other infectious diseases. Not only have research teams been developing the vaccines, tests and treatments needed to curb the spread of disease, they are a standing army of experts ready to react when a crisis breaks.

For the newly established PANDORA network, their 1st crisis came earlier than expected. 'We formally launched our consortium on 8 May 2018 -- the day the Ebola outbreak in DRC was officially declared to be an epidemic,' recalled Professor Francine Ntoumi from the Fondation Congolaise pour la Recherche Médicale, Republic of Congo, who jointly leads PANDORA.

It was a baptism of fire, but showed the value of mobilising networks in an emergency. 'The Ebola outbreak is near the border of the DRC and Republic of Congo. We immediately organised in the DRC and engaged with our contacts in the Republic of Congo, including ethics committees and regulatory authorities,' she said.

The goal was to secure swift approval for the steps to take in managing Ebola cases and to mobilise the funds needed to train health professionals. A workshop attracted experts from both sides of the Congo River, as well as from Gabon, Cameroon and the Central African Republic. Healthcare workers were trained in the use of new diagnostic tests and infection control measures - essential skills if the virus spreads to neighbouring countries.

After the current epidemic has passed, the EU-funded network will continue its work, collecting data on human and animal health, building capacity in laboratories and health systems, and further expanding the availability of diagnostic tools. For Professor Ntoumi, this is a radical shift from the fire-fighting approach of the past.

'When there is a fire, international agencies come to help -- then they go,' she said. 'But if local people are not trained in how to stop the next fire, there will be another crisis. I see our network as a way to stop fires from developing in the first place. It's a long-term, more sustainable solution.'

Europe has set up its own network of clinical research sites, primary care clinics and hospitals to prepare for new and re-emerging health threats. PREPARE was launched in 2014 and connects more than 1000 sites across the EU.

Now a new network -- the African coalition for Epidemic Research, Response and Training (ALERRT) -- aims to build on this model for sub-Saharan Africa. Professor Peter Horby, from the UK's Oxford University, a member of PREPARE [Partnership for Rural Europe] and coordinator of ALERRT, said the challenges facing Europe and Africa are significantly different.

'The difference is quite stark in terms of the outbreak frequency that we will face in ALERRT,' he said. 'The PREPARE network has helped to ready Europe for future outbreaks but has yet to face a major epidemic crisis. In contrast, ALERRT was launched last December [2017] and, before we held our kick-off meeting in March, we had outbreaks to deal with.' ...
