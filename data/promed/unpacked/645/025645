Since the Minnesota Board of Animal Health first reported anthrax
deaths at 2 premises in mid-June of 2006, an additional 9 premises
have confirmed anthrax as a cause of death in livestock. 24 animals
died on these 9 premises for a total of 31 deaths.
7 premises are in Kittson County. One premises in Kittson confirmed
anthrax in the death of horses and another confirmed anthrax in the
death of farmed buffalo.
65 miles to the east, in Roseau and Lake of the Woods Counties, 2
additional premises have confirmed anthrax mortalities. This is the
1st documented anthrax mortality in livestock in Lake of the Woods
County. Minnesota Board of Animal Health and U.S. Department of
Agriculture district veterinarians are investigating these
mortalities and assisting owners in disposal of carcasses by
incineration and burial of ash. None of the affected animals were
vaccinated in 2006.

[The most recent report, date 7 Jul 2006, can be viewed at the
website of the MN Board of Animal Health:
<http://www.bah.state.mn.us/diseases/anthrax/anthrax_prgm.htm>
This latter report has a map showing the various MN counties, and
specifically where Roseau and Lake of the Woods are. All 3 affected
MN counties lie along the Manitoba [Canada] border and so it would
not surprise me if these easterly MN outbreaks reflect outbreaks in
Manitoba; if not, Manitoba will [conversely] be at risk from these MN
outbreaks. Historically anthrax has occurred in those southern
Manitoba counties. It has been a problem in these easterly counties
(in both Manitoba and in Minnesota) [where stock are] not vaccinated,
and these are the herds that get hit -- surprise! surprise! All in
all, it looks more and more likely that there is a background
epizootic in wildlife that is reflected in these odd farm outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ]
