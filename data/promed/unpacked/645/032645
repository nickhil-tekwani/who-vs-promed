TOMATO YELLOW LEAF CURL VIRUS AND CITRUS CANKER - USA (FLORIDA)

State officials face new threats to the agriculture industry. The first is
what Jane E. Polston, an expert on plant viruses, calls an epidemic of a
tomato plant virus (yellow leaf curl) that could endanger Florida's $400
million tomato crop. The other is another outbreak of citrus canker, a
bacterial plant disease found in South Florida and recently discovered in
Central Florida, near Sarasota.
The tomato yellow leaf curl virus, found in the Caribbean, first appeared in
March at two commercial greenhouses in Dade County, which had unwittingly
shipped infected plants across the state, said Ms. Polston, who is an
associate professor of plant pathology at the University of Florida. The
virus, in what is thought to be its first appearance in the United States,
struck after the state cut back inspections of commercial nurseries in Dade
County to fight citrus canker, she said.
Florida growers were lucky the tomato virus was discovered during the summer
off-season, said [a spokesperson for] the growers association. When
commercial planting begins in the fall, the association plans to advise
farmers to check daily for infected plants, which must be carefully destroyed
and disposed of to halt the spread of the disease.
Still, there may be hundreds of infected plants in private gardens. Those
plants would show stunted growth, leaves with curled, yellowish margins and
blossoms that drop off without producing fruit.
