Coyotes roaming the hills of Los Angeles carry at least one disease
previously undetected locally, which in rare situations could pose a threat
to people and their pets, public health authorities said. Veterinarians are
voicing new fears because a dog bitten by a coyote in Woodland Hills has
contracted the rare disease.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention has asked a researcher
to investigate the illness, which surfaced in a Danish Schipperke dog
bitten by a coyote June 13. It contracted what a veterinarian believes is a
strain of _Bartonella vinsonii_. The dog has had a 104-degree fever and its
eyes were bleeding internally, causing blindness. The owner feared she
would have to put her dog to sleep, but the dog seems to be recovering.
Edward Breitschwerdt, professor of medicine and infectious diseases in the
College of Veterinary Medicine at North Carolina State University, intends
to obtain blood samples of the dog and has talked with the Veterinarian. He
wants to determine if the dog has _Bartonella vinsonii_ and if it's
possible for [the owner or other people to contract it.
_Bartonella vinsonii_ is a strain in the same family as cat scratch fever,
a disease contracted by the scratch of a cat, and trench fever, a disease
contracted from lice. This disease was seen among soldiers during World War
I. Breitschwerdt first discovered _Bartonella vinsonii_ in dog's blood in
1994 in his laboratory. Further research determined a percentage of
coyotes carried the disease.
County health authorities performed routine investigations of diseases in
coyotes until 1993 when the City Council placed severe limitations
ontrapping, essentially ending the practice. They said they have tested
coyote carcasses periodically since and found coyotes carry many diseases:
babesiosis, blastomycosis, canine hepatitis, hepatazoonosis,
histoplasmosis, hookworms, scabies, American trypanosomiasis, and the
plague (_Yersinia pestis_). [The same diseases carried by the domestic
dog. [Plague, a disease transmitted by infected fleas. Most infected
coyotes and dogs do not develop symptoms of the disease. But, infected cats
develop the disease similar to that in people. Infected cats run a fever,
develop tender, swollen lymph nodes and may die. - PCyrog
Patrick Ryan, chief of veterinary public health at the county (Los Angeles)
Department of Health Services, said it's unlikely people could get one of
those diseases from a coyote, but their dogs and cats could be at risk. "As
far as we've found, coyotes at this point are not a disease threat," Ryan
said. "When studying an animal you will find various diseases. However,
finding diseases is not necessarily a reason to reduce the animal's
population."
Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of disease control programs in the County,
said "They are also canines so we are always watching them to see if they
have rabies."
In the case of _Bartonella vinsonii_, the disease has been found in only
one human, a Wyoming rancher who survived the disease that causes swelling
of the lymph nodes and infections of the heart and eyes. The rancher is
believed to have gotten the disease from a tick, but it's not known if the
tick became infected from feeding on an infected coyote.
"We deal primarily with human health and public health issues at the CDC,"
said Chris Paddock, medical officer with the viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses
Branch of the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia. He referred [the dog owner's call
to Breitschwerdt, a _Bartonella_ expert. "But we will field calls related
to animal health if someone has an expertise in that area. The most
important thing is that the animal is treated appropriately. If it turns
out there is a public health issue related to this, I'm certain
Breitschwerdt will contact us, and we will work with him on it."
University of California, Davis veterinary epidemiologist Bruno Chomel said
research tested more than 900 coyotes throughout California for the disease
and discovered about 30 percent of the coyotes in Southern California carry
the disease. The research was triggered by the case of a child bitten by a
coyote in Santa Clara County (Northern California). The child did not
contract _Bartonella vinsonii_, but another disease. The results of the
study are expected to be published by the CDC this month. "The big question
we are looking at with coyotes is if the infection is transmitted by
fleasor ticks," Chomel said. "If it's transmitted by ticks, could those
ticks bite humans and transmit it to humans?"
"This is really under the auspices of an emerging infectious disease,"
Breitschwerdt said. "That is why the CDC is involved in the _Bartonella_
work because it could infect animals as well as people."
"One way the coyote can benefit the community is acting as a disease
sentinel or an early warning system," Ryan said.
