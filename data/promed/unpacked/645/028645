Potomac fish kill probed
---------------------------
50 000 perch may have succumbed to disease and cold, officials say.
A combination of disease and last week's sudden cold snap might have
caused the death of about 50 000 white perch in the Potomac River
near this Southern Maryland community, state officials said.
Thousands of dead perch were heaped along the beach yesterday [21 Feb
2007] beside a wall of concrete boulders protecting an upscale
subdivision. Scores of seagulls screamed overhead, and flies buzzed
over the rotting fish. "It's apocalyptic, seeing so much death all at
once," said Mike Roller, field supervisor for an archaeological
surveying company, who walked along the littered beach as he returned
from a site his firm is examining for home construction.
Although a few striped bass were mixed into the pile, the fish were
nearly all white perch, about 4 1/2 inches long.
The Maryland Department of the Environment is sending samples of the
dead fish to a lab to determine if they were infected with bacteria
or parasites, said Charlie Poukish, environmental program manager for
the state agency.
"They may have been weakened by some disease and were in the wrong
place at the wrong time, with strong winds, cold weather and shallow
water," Poukish said.
About 3 years ago, a bacteria called vibrio killed more than 100 000
perch in the upper Chesapeake Bay. Investigators are looking into
whether that or other pathogens might have weakened the approximately
50 000 fish that piled up along a 4-mile stretch of the icy Potomac
River in Charles County and another 2000 that washed ashore near Tall
Timbers in St. Mary's County, Poukish said.
The threat to human health is low because most fish diseases don't
easily transfer to people, Poukish said. And the number of perch
killed is not large enough to hurt the fishing industry.
The larger issue is whether a growing number of Chesapeake Bay fish
are becoming sick because of pollution or changes to the environment,
said Andrew Kane, an associate professor at the University of
Maryland School of Medicine.
"There seems to be a trend over the last few decades of a large
number of fish health problems and fish kills," said Kane, who
studies fish health. "The question is whether there is change in the
environment that makes these bugs more virulent or makes fish more
susceptible."
For example, scientists have discovered that 50 percent to 80 percent
of striped bass in the bay carry a disease called mycobacteriosis,
Kane said. It rarely kills the fish, but its presence raises concerns
about the health of the bay, Kane said.
Roller said he 1st saw the dead fish 15 Feb 2007, after a storm that
whipped the shore with fierce, bitterly cold winds and waves. The
shallows of the Potomac were frozen, and the fish were trapped in the
ice, Roller said.
The die-off was not reported until days later. Joe Martin, a
volunteer member of an environmental group called Potomac Riverkeeper
who lives on Swan Point, was strolling along the shore with his wife
about 4 p.m. Monday [19 Feb 2007].
"The beach was completely full of dead fish, all the way down," he
said. "I've never seen so many birds or dead fish. ... It was really
upsetting."
Martin called a hotline at the Maryland Department of the Environment
on Tuesday [20 Feb 2007] morning, and the agency sent a team of
investigators in a boat.
Bruce Michael, director of tidewater ecosystem assessment at the
Maryland Department of Natural Resources, said the Potomac's health
has generally been improving over the past 30 years. A series of
upgrades to the Blue Plains waste treatment plant, which serves the
Washington area, helped limit the huge algae blooms that used to
cover the river in blue-green muck from shore to shore, Michael said.
A ban on phosphorus in detergent also helped, he said. Since then,
the river has seen a resurgence of submerged aquatic vegetation,
which has provided habitat for a good population of bass and other
fish, he said.
But the river still faces serious problems. Every summer, algae
return to the Potomac, sometimes spreading toxins that kill fish.
Last summer [2006], about 30 000 fish of a variety of species died
off Cobb Island when they got caught in a fisherman's net and were
killed by the river's low oxygen levels, caused by poor water
quality. Charles County health officials twice last summer advised
residents of Swan Point not to swim in the river because of high
bacteria levels.
Leslie Martin, Joe Martin's wife, said they used to swim off their
pier frequently a decade ago but rarely did so last year [2006]
because of the bacteria. "We have seen fish kills here before, but
never as concentrated as this," she said.
Poukish, the MDE investigator, said there is no evidence of chemicals
or other high levels of pollution that killed the perch off Swan
Point. A power plant and 2 sewage treatment plants are nearby, but
neither seems to have leaked.
Poukish and his colleagues were in a boat yesterday [21 Feb 2007]
collecting fish for lab analysis and testing the water's acidity and
oxygen levels.
Howard King, director of the fisheries service at the Department of
Natural Resources, said freezing weather alone does not usually hurt
perch. "White perch are pretty hardy. They don't normally succumb to
cold water temperature," King said.
It is not clear what might have harmed the fishes' health, possibly
making them weak enough to be killed by being trapped in a shallow
section of the river during the cold snap, Poukish said.
Vibrio and other pathogens are common in the bay and other bodies of
water, often at harmless levels. "Vibrio is one of the common
bacteria that we find with white perch," Poukish said. "But there
could be other stressors involved," including other diseases or poor
water quality, that may have weakened the fish, he said.

White perch (_Morone americana_) are also known as Grey Perch,
Blue-Nose Perch, and Silver Perch.
Perch can be eaten, although they are usually only about 12 inches
(30 cm) in length. Despite their somewhat small size, they seem to
put up a good fight when caught and are favored by some as a sport
fish. They are also a nice pan size fish boasting firm white flesh
that is quite tasty. These fish like rivers, streams, lakes, brackish
waters, and can be found in freshwater and saltwater.
As the article points out, this die-off is not devastating to the
species or the industry, but it is important to determine the cause
of the deaths.
We look forward to a report of the test results. - Mod.TG]
