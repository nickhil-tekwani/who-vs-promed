DENGUE, PROSPECTS - AUSTRALIA

An outbreak of dengue fever traced to a backpacker in Cairns has seen the
number of dengue cases jump from about 70 in 1997 to 400 in 1998, with
another three months of the peak danger season to go.
Queensland public health services manager John Scott yesterday renewed a
call for people to exercise vigilance in removing stagnant water from
around their homes, potential breeding sites for mosquitoes. Dr Scott
warned that dengue could be wrongly seen as confined to underdeveloped
Asian countries. "We are intimately connected with Asia, in terms of the
diseases that can come in but also in terms of the movement of people," he
said. "If we are going to have that intimate connection, then it's
important that we make sure that we do everything we can to keep Australia
free of this disease."
The warning follows a recent report by the WorldWide Fund for Nature that
global warming could trigger an expansion of potentially life-threatening
diseases in countries such as Australia. In addition to dengue fever, the
report cites malaria, cholera, yellow fever and encephalitis as diseases
that could move into Australia in line with warmer and more extreme weather
conditions. Dengue fever is potentially fatal, causing severe aches and,
in the worst cases, reduced blood volume and haemorrhagic fever. The chance
of death increases to about 5 per cent in "well-managed cases" if a person
is affected a second time with a different strain of the disease.

[There was additional text regarding the effects of global warming but it
was baloney, so I left it out. The above report is bad enough. First of
all, Australia cannot keep Australia free of dengue if dengue already is
there. Second, uncomplicated dengue fever is not a deadly disease
("potentially fatal"), merely an uncomfortable one. It is secondary dengue
that can be associated with complications leading to more serious outcome.
The "take home" lesson from this report should be that Australia is
expecting an increase in cases of dengue fever and is trying outreach to
educate the public about prevention.
The Cuban model for a "top down" approach might be a good one but we have
not been privy to the details of their successes and failures. More
recently, Cuba has indicated it is trying a "bottom up" approach, so
perhaps the "top down" model doesn't work either. In any event, dengue
marches on - Mod.CHC]
