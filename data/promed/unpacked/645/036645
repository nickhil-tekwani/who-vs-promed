Health officials in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, say they have seen a spike in cases of the sexually transmitted infection syphilis this year and point to sexual liaisons met on the Internet as a significant factor, according to a CBC News report 18 Oct 2012.

Capital District Health Authority senior epidemiologist, Holly D'Angelo-Scott says 47 men have tested positive for the sexually transmitted infection so far this year, as compared to 35 cases in all of 2011. Many of the syphilis cases reported are men who met their sexual partner on the Internet, D'Angelo-Scott tells CBC News. "That's probably a common link between some of the cases."

Since 2009, all the 100-plus cases reported in the city have been reported in men, and health officials say it may spread beyond men who have sex with men (MSM) to women.

Halifax is not the only place that is establishing a link between an increase in syphilis and anonymous sexual partners met online. Just last month in Christchurch, New Zealand, health officials said anonymous sexual hookups arranged over the Internet is the likely reason for an "incredible rise" in syphilis young gay and bisexual men in the city.

Last year in Alberta, where health officials were trying to battle their own syphilis problems, they even came up with a parody website, plentyofsyph.com, in an attempt to combat their syphilis problem [ProMED-mail post Syphilis - USA, Canada 20081112.3561]. The website has since been taken down and replaced.

Public health officials say there are a record number of syphilis cases in the Halifax area this year as the outbreak of the disease continues to grow.

Holly D'Angelo-Scott, a senior epidemiologist with public health in the Capital District Health Authority, said 47 men have tested positive for the sexually transmitted infection so far this year -- up from 35 cases in all of 2011. The affected men range in age from 18 to 66 years old. Many of them report having sex with multiple partners they met online. "When we look to see the connections between cases, a lot of our cases are meeting their sexual partners through the Internet," said D'Angelo-Scott. "That's probably a common link between some of the cases."

D'Angelo-Scott said the syphilis outbreak in the Halifax area began in 2009. All the 115 cases confirmed syphilis cases since that time have been men -- a similar pattern to outbreaks in other major Canadian cities.

But D'Angelo-Scott said infections may start to occur in local women too. "It is possible that there will be a progression from this population of men who have sex with men to women," she told CBC News. "We do have individual cases that report having sex with both men and women, or only women, and they do have infectious syphilis. So there's always the possibility of transmission."

D'Angelo-Scott said local men who report being infected by women may have acquired the disease outside of Nova Scotia, or even outside of Canada.

Syphilis can be transmitted by oral, anal and vaginal sex. Condoms provide protection, but D'Angelo-Scott said most infected men don't use them during oral sex. The earliest symptom appears about 21 days after transmission as a sore at the infection site.

The public health message is clear. "We're telling them that if they are engaging in unprotected sex, they need to get tested and tested on a regular basis," said D'Angelo-Scott. Public health officials are working on an information campaign they hope to put on Internet message boards where men go to seek sexual partners. Syphilis tests are free and the disease is easily cured, normally with a single, free shot of antibiotics.

[In the USA, as the rate of primary and secondary (infectious) syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike in the rate of infectious syphilis occurred in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of primary and secondary syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941. From 2001 to 2004, the primary and secondary syphilis rate increased nationally to 2.7, primarily as a result of increases in cases among men who have sex with men (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm).

As in the USA, the rates of infectious syphilis in Canada have been increasing since about 2000. In Canada, the male-to-female rate ratio increased from 1.5:1.0 in 1999 to 6.4:1.0 in 2008, reflecting that more males than females were reported with infectious syphilis, and this disparity increased over time (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php): In 2008, men accounted for 86.1 percent of reported cases. Between 1999 and 2008, the rate in men increased from 0.7 to 7.3 per 100 000 and in women increased from 0.5 to 1.1 per 100 000. In men, the highest reported rate of infectious syphilis was shared between 25-29 year olds and 30-39 year olds (13.3 per 100 000) (http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/std-mts/report/sti-its2008/05-eng.php). Together, these age groups accounted for almost 40 percent of reported cases in men in 2008. In women, the highest reported rate was in 20-24 year olds (3.6 per 100 000). In males, the greatest increase in reported rates of infectious syphilis between 1999 and 2008 was in 25-29 year olds.

In New Brunswick, the Canadian province that borders Nova Scotia, ProMED-mail recently reported [Syphilis - Canada: (NB) 20120210.1038543] an infectious syphilis outbreak that is characterized as involving mainly males, most of whom are men who have sex with men (MSM). Many reported having multiple sex partners, including casual and/or anonymous partners, and at least 5 of the cases were co-infected with HIV. Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, and use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm).

Reported increases in the incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue," which appears to limit effective condom use and to result in high-risk sexual behavior associated with use of drugs or the use of the Internet, which can also lead to unsafe sex with multiple partners.

Nova Scotia in Eastern Canada is one of Canada's 3 Maritime Provinces (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island). Nova Scotia is bounded in the west by New Brunswick.
