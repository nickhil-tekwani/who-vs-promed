[ref: Results from a phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in
African children. N Engl J Med. 2011 [Epub ahead of print]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background
----------
An ongoing hase 3 study of the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of
candidate malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01 is being conducted in seven
African countries.

Methods
-------
>From March 2009 through January 2011, we enrolled 15 460 children in 2
age categories -- 6 to 12 weeks of age and 5 to 17 months of age --
for vaccination with either RTS,S/AS01 or a non-malaria comparator
vaccine. The primary end point of the analysis was vaccine efficacy
against clinical malaria during the 12 months after vaccination in the
first 6000 children 5 to 17 months of age at enrollment who received
all 3 doses of vaccine according to protocol. After 250 children had
an episode of severe malaria, we evaluated vaccine efficacy against
severe malaria in both age categories.

Results
-------
In the 14 months after the 1st dose of vaccine, the incidence of 1st
episodes of clinical malaria in the 1st 6000 children in the older age
category was 0.32 episodes per person-year in the RTS,S/AS01 group and
0.55 episodes per person-year in the control group, for an efficacy of
50.4 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI], 45.8 to 54.6) in
the intention-to-treat population and 55.8 per cent (97.5 per cent CI,
50.6 to 60.4) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against
severe malaria was 45.1 per cent (95 per cent CI, 23.8 to 60.5) in the
intention-to-treat population and 47.3 per cent (95 per cent CI, 22.4
to 64.2) in the per-protocol population. Vaccine efficacy against
severe malaria in the combined age categories was 34.8 per cent (95
per cent CI, 16.2 to 49.2) in the per-protocol population during an
average follow-up of 11 months. Serious adverse events occurred with a
similar frequency in the 2 study groups. Among children in the older
age category, the rate of generalized convulsive seizures after
RTS,S/AS01 vaccination was 1.04 per 1000 doses (95 per cent CI, 0.62
to 1.64).

Conclusions
-----------
The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine provided protection against both clinical and
severe malaria in African children. (Funded by GlaxoSmithKline
Biologicals and the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative; RTS,S
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00866619.)

[The reported study is a double blind, randomized controlled trial in
children up to the age of 32 months enrolling 15 460 children. The
protective efficacy was 55.8 per cent overall and 34.8 per cent
against severe malaria during a 12 month follow up period.

An editorial commenting on the vaccine trial is found in the same
issue of the New Engl J Med (White NJ. NEJM 2011; doi
10.1056/NEJMe1111777;
http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe1111777).

The results published in the paper are remarkably similar to 2
previous studies of the vaccine.

Alonso et al (Lancet 2005; 366:2012-8) found in 2022 children from
Mozambique a 21 month protective efficacy of 35 per cent and a 48 per
cent reduction in severe malaria of the RTS,S/AS02A vaccine.

A later study (Bejon et al. New Engl. J Med. 2008; 259: 2521-31)
included 809 children from Kenya and Tanzania who received 3 doses of
RTS,S/AS01E and reported an overall protective efficacy of 56 per cent
during 7.9 months follow up.

The results reported in the new study are therefore merely confirming
the protective efficacy of the previous studies. The remaining
question, which is the key question after the previous studies
reported a reduction of severe malaria cases, is whether the vaccine
reduces mortality due to malaria in small children. As the vaccine
reduces the number of severe malaria cases it is expected to reduce
childhood mortality due to malaria, and we look forward to see these
data.

Thus the studies reported over the past 6 years demonstrate that the
vaccine has a protective efficacy at the same level as insecticide
treated nets (ITN) presently the basic tool for malaria control in
Africa.

Pending the mortality data, it will be interesting to follow how
vaccine and ITNs will be used in malaria control, how the cost of the
2 interventions will compare and how effective a combination of the 2
may be. - Mod.EP]
