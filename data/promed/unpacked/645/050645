A 20-year-old man, bitten by a tick 3 weeks ago, died on Sunday from
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) at the Eskisehir Osmangazi
University's Faculty of Medicine Hospital.
His family said they had taken [him] to a hospital a few days after the
tick bite, which occurred in the bathroom of their home, located in the
village of Kayi in Eskisehir province.
Turkey is battling the largest-ever recorded outbreak of CCHF, which has
killed 24 people [so far in 2006], with experts saying that more cases of
the Ebola-like disease are inevitable in the coming months.
"We will unfortunately keep seeing cases until at least September, when
they will start to slow because of the cold weather," said Dr Onder
Ergonul, an associate professor at Marmara University who has been involved
with the government's response to the outbreak.
Most of the cases have occurred in 6 provinces in the Black Sea and Central
Anatolia regions: Tokat, Sivas, Gumushane, Amasya, Yozgat and Corum.
Authorities at the World Health Organization (WHO) are awaiting further
information from the Turkish government, including where the other cases
have arisen. Turkish authorities say no cases have been reported in tourist
areas along the Mediterranean coast.
"There have been large outbreaks of this virus before, but we are concerned
about the size of this particular outbreak in Turkey," said Dr. Bernardus
Ganter, WHO's regional advisor for communicable diseases in the European
region.
One of the reasons for the increased numbers, Ganter said, could be a more
sophisticated detection system. Turkey's 1st outbreak of the disease was in
2002, and surveillance has strengthened considerably since.
"We are reassured that the outbreak appears limited to only one part of
Turkey, in Anatolia," said Erg�n�l. More than 90 percent of cases have been
reported in people who have had direct contact with animals, according to
Ergonul.
In an attempt to control the outbreak, Turkish authorities have instituted
stronger surveillance for the disease across the entire country as well as
attempting to educate the population about how they can minimize their risk
of contracting the disease by avoiding contact with ticks. Veterinarians
and entomologists are also looking at ways to control the tick population.
With several previous outbreaks of the disease in recent years, Turkey has
considerable expertise in treating patients.
WHO has been in frequent contact with the Turkish Ministry of Health and is
ready to send teams to the region if requested to do so. Ganter said the
transmission season was expected to last until October.
CCHF emerges particularly in the summer months and is spread to humans via
the bite of an infected tick. The disease, which can be fatal to humans,
has caused deaths in Turkey in recent years.
CCHF was first described in the Crimea in 1944 and later found in Congo in
1956. Vehbi Koc Foundation American Hospital pediatric unit doctors state
that CCHF is caused by ticks infected with the RNA virus, which is a member
of the Nairovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family.
Dr. Gulsemin Guloglu of the Vehbi Koc American Foundation Hospital
pediatric unit says that in some situations the disease is caught as a
result of contact with the blood or tissue of infected animals. Noting that
nearly 30 kinds of tick can carry the virus, Dr. Guloglu says Hyalomma
ticks are the most prevalent carriers.

[As noted in previous CCHF - Turkey posts, CCHF can be contracted by health
care personnel via exposure to the blood of acutely infected patients,
usually through needle sticks. A map of Turkey can be accessed at
