Six-year-old Nhaijah Russell swallowed 3 or 4 squirts of seemingly innocuous liquid hand sanitizer at school. It tasted good, she said, like strawberry.

It also contained enough alcohol to make her dangerously drunk. She arrived at the emergency room slurring her words and unable to walk.

Since 2010, poison control center hotlines across the United States have seen a nearly 400 percent increase in calls related to children younger than 12 ingesting hand sanitizer, according to new analysis by the Georgia Poison Center.

"Kids are getting into these products more frequently, and unfortunately, there's a percentage of them going to the emergency room," said Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the center's director.

The amount of alcohol in hand sanitizer ranges from 45 to 95 percent. Ingesting even small amounts -- as little as 2 or 3 squirts in some cases -- can cause alcohol poisoning. By comparison, wine and beer contain about 12 percent and 5 percent alcohol, respectively, Lopez said.

Nhaijah's blood-alcohol level was .179, twice what's considered legally drunk in an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, who treated her in the emergency room at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta. Doctors had to watch Nhaijah overnight at a nearby children's hospital for signs of brain trauma, since the alcohol had caused her to fall and hit her head, he said.

"That was very scary," Nhaijah's mother, Ortoria Scott, said. "It could have been very lethal for my child."

Alcohol poisoning can cause confusion, vomiting and drowsiness. In severe cases, a child can stop breathing.

Lopez said 3266 hand sanitizer cases related to young children were reported to poison control centers in 2010. In 2014, the number increased to 16 117 cases.

Last week, Lopez sent a letter to Georgia's school systems warning about children drinking hand sanitizer. He explained that some children do it intentionally in order to get drunk, while others do it on a dare from friends. Still others, he said, drink sanitizer because it looks tasty.

"A kid is not thinking this is bad for them," Lopez said. "A lot of the more attractive (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented. There are strawberry, grape, orange-flavored hand sanitizers that are very appealing to kids."

Lopez recommends parents and teachers store hand sanitizer out of reach of children and monitor its use. He said non-alcohol based products or sanitizing wipes can also be used.

[The alcohol content of these hand sanitizers is very high in order to kill some germs. Still one has to wonder whether the sanitizers at a school do that much good? Are children learning to use sanitizers instead of hand washing? Alcohol in high concentrations is very drying to the skin. As these sanitizers are not designed to be used as a replacement for soap, how much is absorbed over long periods of time through the skin?

"Alcohol poisoning is a serious -- and sometimes deadly -- consequence of drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time, or small amounts of substances with extremely high concentrations of alcohol. Drinking too much too quickly can affect your breathing, heart rate, body temperature and gag reflex and potentially lead to coma and death.

Alcohol poisoning can occur when adults or children accidentally or intentionally drink household products that contain alcohol, such as hand sanitizers.

A person with alcohol poisoning needs immediate medical attention. If you suspect someone has alcohol poisoning, call for emergency medical help right away.

Alcohol poisoning signs and symptoms include:
- Confusion
- Vomiting
- Seizures
- Slow breathing (less than eight breaths a minute)
- Irregular breathing (a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths)
- Blue-tinged skin or pale skin
- Low body temperature (hypothermia)
- Passing out (unconsciousness) and can't be awakened
It's not necessary to have all these signs and symptoms before you seek help. A person who is unconscious or can't be awakened is at risk of dying.

Early signs of intoxication may appear as slurred speech and incoordination. These can quickly change to those listed above depending upon the body size, the alcohol concentration and the amount ingested.

Alcohol in the form of ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is found in alcoholic beverages, mouthwash, cooking extracts, some medications and certain household products. Ethyl alcohol poisoning generally results from drinking too many alcoholic beverages, especially in a short period of time.

Other forms of alcohol -- including isopropyl alcohol (found in rubbing alcohol, lotions and some cleaning products) and methanol or ethylene glycol (a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents) -- can cause another type of toxic poisoning that requires emergency treatment.

There are a number of consequence to alcohol poisoning including brain damage, aspiration pneumonia and death.

Alcohol poisoning treatment usually involves supportive care while your body rids itself of the alcohol. This typically includes:
- Careful monitoring
- Prevention of breathing or choking problems
- Oxygen therapy
- Fluids given through a vein (intravenously) to prevent dehydration
- Use of vitamins and glucose to help prevent serious complications of alcohol poisoning

Adults and children who have accidentally consumed methanol or isopropyl alcohol may need hemodialysis -- a mechanical way of filtering waste and toxins from your system -- to speed the removal of alcohol from their bloodstream."

This child was lucky, but it clearly highlights the issue of hand sanitizers in schools. While they are designed to kill microbes, clearly secondary uses may have lethal consequences. This begs the question: is it needed in schools?
