Three hospital officials have been penalized after 11 kidney patients
were infected with hepatitis C [virus] after they received dialysis
at a hospital in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
local health authorities said Tuesday [18 May 2010]. President of the
Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Wulate Front Banner was removed
from his post, and 2 deputy presidents of the hospital received
administrative penalties, said a spokesman with the Bayannur City
Health Department.

According to the spokesman, the hospital had treated 60 kidney
patients with dialysis since 2002. But 11 patients have been
diagnosed with hepatitis C [virus infection] since July 2009, when
the hospital began hepatitis screening tests for its dialysis
patients. The regional health department said the disease was spread
through dialysis at the hospital. Authorities received a report and
launched an investigation in April 2010.

[Unfortunately, transmission of hepatitis C virus (and/or other
blood-borne agents) is not an uncommon event wherever there have been
lapses in the handling and administration of blood or blood-derived
products. Earlier this year (2010), as recorded in a ProMED-mail
report archived below, several kidney dialysis patients were infected
with hepatitis C virus at a hospital in China's Anhui Province. In
the incident described above, it appears that prior to July 2009,
kidney dialysis was carried out in the absence of tests for hepatitis
C virus infection.
