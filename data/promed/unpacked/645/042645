Republic of the Congo: Ebola Fever Case Number Reaches 110 with 89 Deaths
--------------------------------------------------
As at Wed 5 Mar 2003, 110 cases of Ebola virus infection had been
confirmed in the Cuvette-Ouest Region of the Republic of Congo (ROC),
resulting in 89 deaths so far, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
reported. 79 of the deaths occurred in the district of Kelle, while
another 10 occurred in Mbomo District. WHO further reported that
another 86 individuals who had been in contact with people suffering
from the highly contagious haemorrhagic fever were being monitored.
Meanwhile, scientists meeting in the capital, Brazzaville, at a
conference to discuss the current outbreak and means of fighting the
disease in the future, said they had not yet identified the reservoir
of the Ebola virus -- a critical element needed in planning more
effective strategies to combat the disease. "That's the fundamental
question. We must come up with answers to this question, because the
entire world is awaiting our findings," Christophe Boesch, an
independent researcher, was quoted by Agence France Presse (AFP) as
saying on Wednesday. The meeting, which began on Tuesday and was due
to end on Thursday, was being attended by some 70 medical
researchers, anthropologists, virologists, doctors, veterinarians,
and representatives from tropical disease research centres in Europe,
the US, and from the UN, according to AFP.
Ebola is characterised by fever, diarrhoea, severe blood loss, and
intense fatigue, and is transmitted through direct contact with body
fluids of infected persons or of other primates. There is no cure,
and between 50 percent and 90 percent of victims die. The best way of
halting its spread is through prevention and prompt detection and
isolation of suspected cases.
Authorities were first alerted to a possible Ebola outbreak in late
2002 when a band of gorillas in the region began dying. Tests carried
out on the bodies confirmed that they had died of Ebola. The current
outbreak is believed to have been caused by villagers eating primates
infected by Ebola.

Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Republic of the Congo - WHO Update 7
------------------------------------------------
As of Fri 7 Mar 2003, a total of 5 laboratory-confirmed and 105
probable cases, including 89 deaths have been reported from Ebola
haemorrhagic fever, in the districts of Mbomo and Kelle in Cuvette
Ouest Region (see previous report:
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_02_28/en/>).
The Ministry of Health, WHO and the international team continue to
train health workers in the treatment of Ebola, carry out contact
tracing, and provide essential medical equipment. Experts from the
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network who have been working to
contain outbreak include those from Bernhard-Nocht-Institut, Hamburg,
Germany, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, United
States, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium and the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, England.

The national Red Cross Society is assisting with social mobilization
activities to increase awareness and understanding of Ebola in the
community.

[Since the Reuters report dated Tue 4 Mar 2003 (see: Ebola
hemorrhagic fever - Congo Rep. (15) 20030304.0543), the number of
confirmed cases of Ebola fever has increased by 2 and deaths by one,
whereas the number of contacts under surveillance has decreased by
44. Although consumption of bushmeat has been suggested as a possible
source of the outbreak, the report of the proceedings of the
conference in Brazzaville suggests that human and non-human primates
can contract infection from the same source and that the identity of
this reservoir of Ebola virus remains unknown. - Mod.CP]
