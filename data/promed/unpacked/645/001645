There have been 433 cases of chikungunya in Samoa over the past month.

The Ministry of Health's latest figures show that since 21 Aug [2014], 239 females and 194 males have contracted the disease at a rate of 2.3 per thousand people.

The Samoa Government is carrying out control measures by spraying in public places, wharves, and airports, to eradicate mosquito breeding places.

[The chikungunya outbreak continues to grow, from 269 cases reported on 25 Aug 2014 to the 433 reported above. One hopes that a prompt and aggressive clean up of breeding sites will reduce the vector mosquito population enough to halt, or at least reduce, transmission.

The 3rd International Conference on Small Island Developing States (http://www.sids2014.org) was held from 1-4 Sep 2014 in Apia, Samoa, and was preceded by activities related to the conference from 28-30 Aug 2014, also in Apia, Samoa. The very brief report above makes no mention of risk to attending delegates, although active virus transmission was occurring at the time. Not only is there risk of the outbreak adversely affecting the conference, there was subsequent risk of Samoa serving as a focus of infection, with conference delegates becoming infected and taking the virus back to their home countries and initiating transmission there, if vector mosquitoes were present.
