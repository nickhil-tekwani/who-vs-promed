Churchill barn quarantined due to herpes virus
--------------------------------------------------
The Kentucky Department of Agriculture quarantined barn 47 at
Churchill Downs on Friday (26 Oct 2007) after a horse trained by
David Carroll tested positive for equine herpesvirus (EHV1), a
contagious, potentially fatal disease that can cause upper
respiratory problems and loss of coordination.

Carroll said the horse, a 3-year-old he declined to identify, began
showing neurological problems Thursday [25 Oct 2007] and was shipped
to Hagyard Equine Medical Institute in Lexington, KY. Tests taken
revealed the presence of the virus Thursday evening. He said the
horse is "going to be fine, make a complete recovery."

The quarantine order -- which confines horses stabled in barn 47 and
prohibits them from being shipped, trained, or raced -- affects
approximately 35 horses, split between 2 trainers, Carroll and Al
Stall Jr. A separate division of Carroll-trained horses at Churchill
Downs Trackside is not under quarantine.

Horses trained by Carroll and Stall were scratched at Keeneland on
Friday and others were to be scratched over the weekend.

Rusty Ford, the equine programs manager for the office of Kentucky
State Veterinarian Dr. Robert Stout, DVM, said the implementation of
the quarantine was ordered in an effort to contain and isolate any
possible equine herpevirus cases to that barn and prevent any spread
of the virus. Biosecurity measures have been added for the Churchill
Downs fall meet, which begins Sunday [28 Oct 2007], including
restricting horses that ship in to race to the track's receiving and
stakes barns. Disinfecting procedures also have been increased at the
receiving and stakes barns, starting gate, and paddock.

Test results "suggest to us that we are dealing with an animal that
has a low level of the virus in its system, and that works to our
advantage," Ford said. "If that is the case, the infected horse would
present a lesser risk of transmission of the virus to other horses in
the barn or the general horse population."

The disease can be spread through the air when a horse coughs,
although studies indicate that it is short-lived and susceptible to
disinfectants. It poses no danger to humans. The recommended
quarantine period is generally as many as 21 days after potential
exposure. That period could be reduced if test results show a milder,
neurological strain, not a mutant strain of the virus, Stout said.

The discovery of this latest case of equine herpesvirus comes 2.5
years after it was last found at Churchill Downs in May 2005. At that
time, 3 barns were quarantined, and it immediately affected the
shipping and racing of some horses that had been expected to go from
Churchill Downs to Pimlico to race in Preakness-week stakes.

Cases of the equine herpesvirus have increased at racetracks in
recent years, which Stout attributes to the spread of the mutant
strain of the virus. Since the 2005 Churchill Downs equine
herpesvirus outbreak, Calder Race Course, Turfway Park, Pimlico, The
Meadowlands, Golden Gate, and Bay Meadows have had cases of horses
testing positive for the virus.

During past discoveries of the equine herpesvirus in Kentucky,
quarantined horses were allowed to train -- separate from the general
horse population -- approximately a week after the start of the quarantine.

[Equine herpesvirus is also known as rhinopneumonitis and is a viral
disease (EHV-1) caused by a herpesvirus. It may present as a severe
respiratory infection, but it may also cause a neurological disease,
or abortion in pregnant mares. There is a vaccine for it. The
immunity inferred from the disease or the vaccine are relatively
short. Horses on the show or racing circuit are often vaccinated
every 6 months.

Quarantine measures are certainly recommended, but so are biosecurity
issues to be sure it is not transferred between barns or from the ill
horse to other stable mates. - Mod.TG]
