From: Ron St.John <Ron_St.John@hc-sc.gc.ca>

In reference to the two reported cases of imported cholera in Canada this
year, I erroneously reported both as Ogawa 01. In fact, the isolation from
the case in Ontario was not 01 or 0139, and hence was not an epidemic strain.
[Case #2 in Ontario: 78 year old female, traveled to Equatorial Guinea from
14 Aug to 4 Sep 1998. Hospitalized on return, diganosis confirmed on 9 Sep
1998.
