For the last 3 years, the _Phytophthora palmivora_ has caused decline of durian harvest in Davao region by about 10 per cent and the disease continues to be one of the challenges the industry is facing.

Davao Industry Council's Larry Miculob said, "It has really a high level of destruction in Davao City." As _P. palmivora_ does not only affect the durian fruits but the entire tree, he said this resulted to a total loss of production. To counter the problem, growers are using fungicide especially after rainfall. He said the more it rains, the higher the chance of _P. palmivora_ eating up the trees and fruits.

The Department of Agriculture [DICDC] has conducted research [and] had stated that the Puyat variety is the most resistant [and] ideal rootstock material. DICDC continues to encourage growers to plant durian varieties that are proven to be tolerant of the disease.

[Durian includes a number of species in the genus _Durio_, of which at least 9 produce edible fruit. _Durio zibethinus_ is available on the international market, other species are used regionally.

The fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora palmivora_ (Pp) is considered one of the worst pathogens of the crop affecting different plant parts and growth stages. Symptoms may include root rot followed by tree dieback; wilting and dieback of seedlings; branch and trunk cankers; fruit rot before and after harvest. Tree mortality is high and more than 30 per cent yield loss has been reported.

Pp is a very common pathogen in tropical environments causing rotting diseases on more than 150 host species. It is associated with various bud rots of coconut and other palms and also causes black pod disease of cocoa, with both diseases amongst the most devastating for the respective crops. Some other commercially important hosts are black pepper, rubber, breadfruit and papaya.

The pathogen is spread by soil, wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect activities) and with infected plant or other material. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations, with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci simultaneously. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach, including cultural practices (phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and burning of severely affected plants, as well as treatments with appropriate agrochemicals (for example copper compounds, commercial fungicides) at or before onset of symptoms.

Trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be effective against some _Phytophthora_ diseases of trees. However, they need to be repeated whenever protection is required. This method is being used in the control of _P. cinnamomi_ in, for example, jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in Australia. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
