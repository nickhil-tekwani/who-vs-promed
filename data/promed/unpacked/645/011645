As a result of the second reported case of human anthrax infection, health
officials are warning South Texas ranchers, hunters, and vacationers to
avoid contact with dead or sickly-looking animals. Health officials learned
late Friday of a second probable case of human anthrax exposure, both in
Val Verde County ranch workers. Tests are still underway, but if confirmed,
they would be the first human anthrax cases in Texas since 1988, said Julie
Rawlings, an epidemiologist with the Texas Department of Health.
The people most likely to encounter infected animals should be familiar
with safety precautions because anthrax is endemic to South Texas, Julie
Rawlings said. The ranchers and Parks & Wildlife employees should know the
best way to deal with them is by burning [the carcasses of infected
animals and to avoid any kind of direct contact, especially if [the
ranchers and Parks & Wildlife employees have any cuts on their skin where
they might come in contact with the animals, Rawlings said.
Hundreds of deer and several horses and cattle have died from probable
anthrax disease in what health officials are describing as the worst
outbreak in 2 decades. Confirmed cases have been reported in Val Verde and
Uvalde counties, and likely animal deaths have been reported in Bandera,
Edwards, Kinney, and Real counties. "I had one client (who) told me he had
counted at least 50 on one ranch," said Dr. Cecil Arnim Jr., a Uvalde
veterinarian.
In Del Rio, a ranch worker [first case who skinned an animal that may have
died from the disease is believed to have contracted anthrax, and was being
treated Friday, said Dr. James Lenarduzzi, area director for the Texas
Animal Health Commission. The man is responding to treatment and was
expected to be released soon.
"We've had reports of 30, 40, and 50 deer discovered dead. One ranch
reported 200 to 300 dead deer," Lenarduzzi told the San Antonio
Express-News. "We expect to get more cases but we don't know how many.
Usually, it starts to decline after the first arrival of cooler weather."
Lenarduzzi said the anthrax epidemic is the worst outbreak since the late
1970s, when the disease killed large numbers of livestock. The wet spring
in South Texas was the primary culprit behind the outbreak, he said.

Regarding the second case of anthrax in Val Verde:
Physician diagnosed case. Per physician, exposure would have been while
vaccinating goats about 10 days prior to onset of lesion (22 Jun
2001). First serum [was drawn nearly 2 weeks after onset [and will reach
CDC tomorrow. Second specimen will be drawn next Monday.
First case still unconfirmed. We'll need another specimen. First 2 may
have been drawn too early.
