[It is now 7 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan. In today's report there are 4 new reports of locally transmitted infection -- 3 in Guangdong and 1 in Heilongjiang, same profile as in yesterday's (9 Apr 2020) update. In the past week, there have been a total of 12 locally transmitted infections confirmed in Guangdong. It is now about 10 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong... I repeat my questions of 7 Apr 2020: is this increase related to the lifting of restrictions? Are there chains of transmission that can easily be followed? Are these cases related to importations? There were a total of 46 newly confirmed cases of which 42 were imported cases.

According to the report above, a total of 81 953 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3339 deaths, representing an increase of 46 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (9 Apr 2020) report, and 3 newly reported death (all in Hubei, 2 in Wuhan.). An additional 8 suspected cases were newly reported, all in imported cases, 5 in Heilongjiang, 2 in Shanghai and 1 in Jiangsu. 16 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases continue to increase daily. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

A total of 42 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 1183. There are an additional 53 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 34 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 7 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1092. 338 of these are importations from abroad. There were 14 originally asymptomatic cases that have developed symptoms in the past 24 hours -- all were imported cases.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and ended it in Wuhan on, 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing.. There does appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong that is of concern, but clearly the most concern is the imported cases returning to China.

Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 65.0% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 12.7% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 7 newly confirmed cases, 1 an importation, the other 6 locally acquired.

Quarantined imported cases represented 20% of the newly confirmed cases, with 6 newly confirmed cases in quarantine on arrival in the airport. Of interest is that 12 (40%) of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases and 18 (60%) were locally acquired. 12 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

These 4 provinces combined account for 67.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Piedmont, with 12.4% of the newly confirmed cases reported is seeing the same as Veneto (12.4%) and more activity than Emilia-Romagna (11.4%). Lombardy is still the main contributor representing 31.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 32 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 30 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown is being extended until 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details)

[4] Iran: 68 192 total cases, 4232 deaths

https://en.radiofarda.com/a/iran-reports-122-new-coronavirus-deaths-as-it-set-to-reopen-low-risk-businesses/30546652.html


Iran's Health Ministry has reported 122 new deaths related to the novel coronavirus, taking the overall death toll in the Middle East's worst-hit country to 4232. Spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said on [10 Apr 2020] that 1972 new infections were recorded in the past 24 hours, putting the total at 68 192.

Jahanpour also said 35 465 people have recovered from the COVID-19 respiratory disease since the outbreak began in February [2020]. "In the past 24 hours, we have unfortunately seen an increase in cases of the disease in 5 to 8 provinces, including Tehran," Jahanpour said.

The announcement comes as Iran is set to reopen what officials call "low-risk" businesses. President Hassan Rohani has ordered the country's economy to slowly begin opening back up starting [11 Apr 2020], leading to worries Iran could see a 2nd wave of infections.

"Of course we don't want any more coronavirus victims; at the same time we don't want to let people starve to death," Rohani said on [8 Apr 2020], noting that many people have gone 2 months without being paid.

The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 502 876, including 18 747 deaths, an increase from 468 566 cases, and 16 691 deaths. New York state, with 172 358 (34.5%) cumulative case reports and 10 854 (31.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. New York City, according to the New York City Department of Health (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) website reported 94 409 cases and 5429 deaths as of 5 pm on 10 Apr 2020. Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3561 newly confirmed cases 10.9%), Massachusetts (2033 newly confirmed cases 5.9%), Pennsylvania (1794 newly confirmed cases 5.2%), Illinois (1465 newly confirmed cases 4.3%), and Michigan (1279 newly confirmed cases 3.7%).

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain is starting to decrease. That being said, Spain is now 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, having surpassed Italy. From a high of 9222 cases reported in 24 hours on 31 Mar 2020, there has been a gradual decline in daily cases reported so that recent days have shown a lowering to levels of 4000s and 5000s. As of today [10 Apr 2020], totals of 157 022 cases and 15 843 deaths have been reported, up from 152 446 cases and 15 238 deaths in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 197.7, having been slowly decreasing over the past 6 days from a high of 217.3 on 4 Apr 2020 to 197.7 today. It is 1st in Europe and 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 157 022 cases, approximately 66 872 (42.6%) have been hospitalized and 7482 (4.8%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data. The crude reported case fatality rate is 10.1%, with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7212001,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.MPP]
