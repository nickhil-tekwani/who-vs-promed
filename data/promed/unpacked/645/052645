[2] Burden of chikungunya virus infections
Date: September 2015
Source: International Journal of Infectious Diseases 38:60-61 [summarized, edited]
http://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(15)00182-4/pdf


Cardona-Ospina J.A. , Diaz-Quijano F.A., Rodriguez-Morales A.J.. Burden of chikungunya in Latin American countries: estimates of disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) lost in the 2014 epidemic.

The burden of chikungunya virus disease (CHIK) in Latin America is an emerging concern, as virus spread is out of control, and recent studies have reported that the disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in some parts of the region could be higher than those during the 2006 epidemics in India. Recent estimates indicate that between 385 835 and 429 058 patients in Latin America will develop post-CHIK chronic inflammatory rheumatism (pCHIK-CIR). However, the real disease burden and economic impact remain unknown, and there are no current estimates of the expected disease burden in the region.

In this study, DALYs for pCHIK-CIR in Latin America were estimated by country, using the method of Murray. As no disability weight is available for pCHIK-CIR, the disability weight reported for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (0.233) was used. Expected incident cases progressing to pCHIK-CIR and its duration were assumed on the basis of those reported previously.

Estimates for the dengue burden in the region have indicated that 69 000 DALYs were lost in 2004. This is 2 times lower than the estimate for pCHIK-CIR, suggesting that CHIK could become the new most important arbovirosis in Latin America in terms of chronic disability. Current arbovirus infections caused by chikungunya virus, but also by dengue and other emerging viruses, such as Zika and Mayaro, that have rheumatic manifestations and share overlapping symptoms, require integrated vector control, including significant community participation and integrated arboviral disease control programs in the endemic countries of the region.

Finally, there is a need to act in order to achieve CHIK control in the region. Direct and indirect costs of disease, although unknown, continue to increase. The effects of pCHIK-CIR epidemics could lead to fragile health systems being overwhelmed and to an increase in the burden of other vector-borne diseases. Control strategies must be approached from a global perspective, since the disease spread and progression to chronic forms remain out of control. ... [and] an effective CHIK vaccine is still a long way off.

[There is a very interesting table in the report that provides estimated DALYs related to pCHIK-CIR incidence by country in Latin America for 2014. One hopes that the serious health and economic effects of chikungunya virus infections will provide sufficient justification to intensify surveillance and stimulate the development of rapid, low-cost diagnostic tools and better approaches to vector control. - Mod.TY]
