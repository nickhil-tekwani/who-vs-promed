Cholera/diarrhoea outbreak in Liberia
The national health authorities of Liberia have reported an outbreak of
cholera/diarrhoea which started at the end of May.
[Yet another example of complete disregard of the existing International
Health Regulations, which require reporting of any suspect case of cholera
within 24 h. In mitigation it must be said that Liberia has been suffering
from armed conflict for months. - Mod.JW
The areas affected by the outbreak are Nimba County and Margibi County. Up
to 26 June a total of 560 cases with 12 deaths had occurred. The county
health teams carried out various control measures in the areas affected
(chlorination of wells, health education, opening of ORT treatment
centres). Additional support and supplies were requested from the Ministry
of Health. Follow-up missions were undertaken by WHO in collaboration with
the two county health teams involved.
Another outbreak of severe diarrhoea was reported in Sinoe County at the
beginning of July although the number of cases is not yet known. Heavy
rains in the area have
hampered aid to the area as bridges have been washed away.
As well as the activities carried out by the county health teams, WHO,
UNICEF, the Belgian Red Cross and other NGO's are collaborating with the
national health authorities and the local communities to provide aid.
