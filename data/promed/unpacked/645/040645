South Korea discovered a suspected case of foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] at a cattle farm in Pohang city, about 370 km (230 miles) from
Seoul, according to the agriculture ministry.

The owner of the farm reported to city officials earlier today [31 Oct
2011] that one of his 14 cattle showed symptoms, the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said in an e-mailed statement. The
government is taking samples for testing and plans to announce the
results tomorrow morning [1 Nov 2011], it said.

The Asian nation killed about 9.7 million cattle, pigs and poultry
last winter [2010-2011] because of outbreaks of FMD and bird flu,
which helped fuel inflation and prompted an increase in meat imports.

More than 3 million pigs and cows died of foot-and-mouth (FMD) disease
last winter [2010-2011]. This dealt irreparable damage to farmers.
Korea should take steps to avoid a repeat of the disaster as winter
nears. The government belatedly detected 1500 cows and pigs with FMD
virus. They could easily spread the deadly disease without proper
remedial action. Worrisome is the fact that the infected animals are
scattered across the country.

Authorities should take precautionary steps to prevent overseas
travelers from carrying the virus during the winter season. Special
care is necessary against tourists visiting Viet Nam, Taiwan and China
where there have been FMD outbreaks.

The government must press farmers to have their animals vaccinated.
Many are reluctant to do this out of concern that vaccinated pigs
might miscarry.

Few underestimate the seriousness of the damage FMD does. Last year
[2010], the economic loss hovered around 3 trillion won [USD 2.7
billion]. If an epidemic takes hold again this winter, many farmers
will sustain damages they cannot cope with. The government should be
fully prepared against the disease, including active surveillance and
quarantine.

Last year's [2010] FMD crisis was a man-made disaster. Now, man-made
precautionary measures must be taken. Repeating the same mistake would
be a political minefield for the ruling camp ahead of next year's
[2012] National Assembly and presidential elections.

[The editorial of the Korea Times, published just 3 days prior to the
reported detection of today's (31 Oct 2011) new outbreak, looks like
clairvoyance on the part of the editor.

South Korea's last major FMD serotype O outbreak, which reportedly
started on 26 Nov 2010 and affected various susceptible species, is
termed by the OIE as "continuing," though the last follow-up report
(No 18) was submitted to the OIE on 29 Apr 2011. It included the
suffix: "The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be
submitted." For all 19 reports and an interactive map showing the 155
foci reported, see
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993.
The government eventually decided to apply general vaccination of all
susceptible species.

Earlier during 2010, 3 FMD epizootics, one of them caused by FMDV
serotypes A and 2 by serotype O, were reported by S. Korea with a
total number of 20 outbreaks; for OIE's details, see at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=country_reports&year=2010.

North Korea initially reported its epizootic (similarly, FMDV serotype
O) in February 2011, though the outbreak is suspected to have started
at least a month earlier. Information on the current FMD situation
there will be helpful.

Official notification on the current case in S. Korea, including data
on the countrywide vaccinations carried out during 2011 and the
vaccination history of the affected cattle, is anticipated.
