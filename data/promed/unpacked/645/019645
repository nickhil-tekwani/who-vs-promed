State witnessing spurt in chickenpox cases
------------------------------------------
Guwahati and many other areas of the State are witnessing a spurt in
cases of chickenpox [varicella]. Among those who have been affected
are a large number of children. Concerns about the disease stem from
the fact that the infection is highly contagious and can spread
without direct contact with a carrier. An airborne disease, it can
spread through sneezing or coughing of an infected person apart from
direct contact.

According to doctors' a child or adult with chickenpox may develop
itchy, fluid-filled blisters which burst and form crusts. The virus
that causes chickenpox is varicella-zoster virus [now human herpes
virus 3], the same virus that also causes herpes zoster in adults.

There has been an increase in the number of people who have been
diagnosed with chickenpox in clinics and doctors' chambers in the past
few weeks, and those infected have come in from varied backgrounds,
which imply that the infection has not been restricted to any
particular strata.

Anyone infected by the virus should ideally stay in quarantine to
minimize contact with others. Proper hygiene should be maintained, and
the diet should ensure that dehydration does not take place.
Scratching should be avoided as it may lead to scars.

This season, a large number of young children have been infected by
the virus. Dr Ranjan Saikia, a city based pediatrician mentioned that
the number of cases is quite high in and around Guwahati. He said in
case of a child showing the symptoms of chickenpox, a doctor's advice
should be sought immediately. He stated that children between the age
of 15 months and 10 years can also be vaccinated to resist the
infection.

Keeping the child in quarantine is recommended, and those in contact
with the child must take necessary protection so that the infection
does not spread, he added. In case of a lactating mother being
infected, the infant may be breast fed, but otherwise contact with the
mother should be minimized.

[Chickenpox is prevalent worldwide and outbreaks have occurred
throughout India in the recent past. Chickenpox is highly infectious
and spreads from person to person by direct contact or through the air
from an infected person's coughing or sneezing or from aerosolization
of virus from skin lesions. A person with chickenpox is contagious 1-2
days before the rash appears and until all blisters have formed scabs.
It takes from 10-21 days after exposure for someone to develop
chickenpox.

In children, chickenpox most commonly causes an illness that lasts
about 5-10 days. Children usually have symptoms such as high fever,
severe itching, an uncomfortable rash, and dehydration or headache. In
addition, about 1 in 10 unvaccinated children who get the disease will
have a complication from chickenpox. These complications include
infected skin lesions, dehydration from vomiting or diarrhea, or more
serious complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis.

Certain groups of people are more likely to have more severe illness
with serious complications. These include adults, infants,
adolescents, and people whose immune systems have been weakened
because of illness or medications such as long-term use of steroids.
Serious complications from chickenpox include bacterial infections
which can involve many sites of the body including the skin, tissues
under the skin, bone, lungs (pneumonia), joints, and blood. Other
serious complications are due directly to infection with the
varicella-zoster virus and include viral pneumonia, bleeding problems,
and encephalitis.

In some countries a chickenpox vaccine is available (but not yet in
India) and is usually administered in 2 doses in combination with MMR
(mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine which provides a high degree of
protection in children.
