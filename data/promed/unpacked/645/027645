[Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Zambia. The following information is available from the WRLFMD-Pirbright Institute web site at http://www.wrlfmd.org/southern-africa/zambia#panel-6551.

FMDV serotype / Years (not comprehensive)
-----------------------------------------
Untyped / 1932-1933
O / 1976, 1982, 2000, 2010, 2018-2020
A / 1990, 2015, 2018
SAT 1 / Livestock: 1953-1955, 1973-1974, 1979-1981, 1987-1988, 2000, 2004-2005, 2008-2009, 2012; Buffalo: 1993, 1996
SAT 2 / Livestock: 1948, 1950, 1956-1958, 1960, 1964-1965, 1969, 1975, 1981-1982, 2007-2009, 2012, 2015, 2019; Buffalo: 1993, 1996
