[Sylvan YF, as opposed to urban YF, means YF acquired in or at the edge of
the rainforest, transmitted by forest mosquitoes, not by the urban vector,
_Aedes aegypti_. There seems to be a hot focus in one locality, Afua. We
hope that YF vaccination is being provided to protect the inhabitants there.
This is 4 more cases than were notified to WHO during the week 12-18 Jun
1998. We hope these were notified to WHO more expeditiously than the
others - Mod.JW
