The General Hospital in Da Nang City has reported treating 3 patients infected with _Streptococcus [suis]_ 2, after they consumed infected pork and blood pudding.

Two of these persons are from the central province of Quang Nam and one is from neighbouring Quang Ngai province, and all 3 were infected after eating contaminated pork and blood pudding.

The Department of Health in Da Nang City has warned of an outbreak of the disease, particularly in view of the coming Tet holiday season [2nd week of February 2013], which sees a high consumption of pork. The department has asked its subdivision offices to track down infected pigs and bury them, so as to prevent infecting humans.

In recent years, several people had been hospitalized with symptoms of respiratory failure and serious bleeding after eating infected pork.

[_Streptococcus suis_ is sub-divided into at least 34 serotypes that vary in pathogenicity. Serotype 2 is the most frequently isolated serotype from diseased animals. _S. suis_ has been isolated from asymptomatic pigs; but virulent strains can cause serious disease mainly in suckling pigs (polyarthritis, meningitis, and septicemia) and in recently weaned and growing pigs (meningitis).

_S. suis_ can cause potentially fatal zoonotic infection in humans, namely meningitis, septicemia, and endocarditis (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC97186/). Toxic shock may also occur if the strain produces the appropriate toxins.

Human _S. suis_ infection occurs mainly among those who slaughter infected pigs. Eating appropriately cooked meat or organs from infected pigs is said to pose no risk of _S. suis_ infection. However, people who eat raw infected pork and cooks who prepare food from infected pork meat and organs would also be at risk of infection. Person-to-person spread does not seem to occur (see http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/50/2/201).

The viral infection, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), in pigs is known to have an immunosuppressive effect, which is thought to increase pigs' susceptibility to infection with _S. suis_.

Quang Nam is a province on the South Central Coast of Viet Nam that is bordered by the coastal province of Quang Ngai to the southeast.
