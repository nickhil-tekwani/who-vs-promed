Two cases of Venezuelan equine encephalitis were detected in Monteria and
Puerto Esondido [department (state or province equivalent) of Cordoba].
Confirmation was made by ICA [Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario --
Colombian Agricultural Institute, where the central veterinary diagnostic
laboratory is located. - Mod.TY] after laboratory tests for zoonoses were
carried out on samples taken from the animals.

The cases occurred specifically in the Todos Pensamos locality of the Nueva
Esperanza settlement in Monteria municipality and in the El Palmar locality
in the municipality of Puerto Escondido.

The Public Health sector of the departmental Secretariat of Health
commissioned a group of epidemiologists and bacteriologists
[microbiologists] to carry out field studies in the area in order to
initiate follow up, surveillance, and epidemiological research activities.
Similarly, to protect the community, the alert status will be maintained,
and prevention measures will be taken jointly between Public Health,
Environmental Health and Emergencies, and Disaster Prevention agencies, and
all health providers of the areas where the cases were reported.

[This is the 2nd report of equine VEE virus cases in Cordoba department
this year (2010). An equine outbreak in Cordoba was reported on 20 Jul
2010, but did not indicate the specific dates for the cases, nor how many
of the 44 equine cases in the 2 departments mentioned were in Cordoba.

One wonders if the current cases are a continuation of that outbreak.
Presumably, VEE virus subtype IAB or IC is involved in these cases. If the
virus was isolated or detected by PCR, it would be of interest to know the
subtype. However, virus isolation from clinical equine VEE virus infections
with encephalitis is very difficult, and it is often better to attempt
virus isolation from febrile equine animals in the same or nearby pastures.

Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) viruses are taxonomically
classified within the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_
(formerly the group A arboviruses). The VEE complex of viruses includes 6
antigenic subtypes (I-VI) divided by antigenic variants. Within subtype I
there are 5 antigenic variants (variants AB-F). Originally, subtypes I-A
and I-B were considered to be distinct variants, but they are now
considered to be identical (I6AB). Antigenic variants I-AB and I-C are
associated with epizootic/epidemic activity in equids and humans. The other
3 variants of subtype I (I-D, I-E, I-F) and the other 5 subtypes of VEE
(II-VI) circulate in natural enzootic cycles.

Enzootic VEE viruses (I-D, I-E, I-F and subtypes II-VI) are primarily found
cycling between sylvatic rodents and _Culex_ mosquitoes (_Melanoconion_
subgenus)
- birds may also be involved in enzootic virus maintenance
- equids and humans are considered incidental or dead-end hosts

The natural or inter-epidemic host for epizootic strains (I-AB and I-C) is
yet undetermined; prevailing science indicates that the epizootic strains
emerge from genetic modification of enzootic strains
- Equidae serve as amplifying hosts for epizootic VEE virus strains; horses
and donkeys produce high viraemias which, in turn, infect a wide range of
mosquitoes
- cattle, swine, chickens, and dogs have been shown to seroconvert after
epizootics; also mortality has been observed in domesticated rabbits, dogs,
goats, and sheep
- during VEE epizootics, virus has been isolated from cotton rats,
opossums, gray fox, bats, and many wild birds
- experimentally, guinea pigs, mice, hamsters, and some non-human primates
have been infected; laboratory rodents are usually subclinically infected
but some isolates can be fatal

Hematophagous insects (mosquitoes, _Culex_ sp, etc) play a central role in
the transmission of all VEE viruses.

Enzootic/endemic VEE viruses are known to be circulating continually in
lowland tropical and sub-tropical forests and swamps of South and Central
America, Mexico, and areas of the United States. Enzootic VEE viruses do
not usually produce clinical encephalomyelitis in the equine species;
however, in 1993 and 1996 in Mexico, the 1-E enzootic subtype caused
limited epizootics in horses.

The incubation period is usually recognised as 1-5 days with high fever
appearing within a day and neurologic signs manifesting themselves at about
5 days.

Although a presumptive diagnosis of "equine encephalomyelitis" can be made
when susceptible animals in tropical or subtropical areas display clinical
signs of encephalomyelitis where haematophagous insects are active, VEE can
only be considered one of various possible causes and final diagnosis will
require laboratory confirmation. A confirmatory diagnosis of VEE is based
on the isolation and identification of the virus or on the demonstration of
seroconversion.

Although enzootic VEE viruses tend not to cause overt signs of disease in
equid hosts this may not always be the case as was seen with I-E virus in
Mexico in 1993 and 1996
- can cause clinical disease in humans
Epizootic virus strains can result in severe disease of horses, mules,
donkeys and zebras but vary in their virulence
- some cause febrile disease and no neurologic signs.
Infection [rates], as measured by circulating antibody, can be as high as
90 per cent but morbidity will vary depending on strains and immune
response. Morbidity rates can vary anywhere from 10-40 per cent to 50-100
per cent. Mortality rates in horses can be 50-70 per cent with case
fatality rates of 38-90 per cent.

The 1st sign observed with infection of epizootic VEE virus is fever;
viraemia occurs concurrently with the onset of fever and can persist for 24
days. Continued anorexia and high fevers, with tachycardia and depression
progressing to more severe central nervous system involvement, [with]
paresis, muscle fasciculation and spasms; incoordination, staggering,
abasia (inability to walk due to impaired muscle coordination) resulting in
open stance to prevent falling and may include blindness. These signs may
progressively worsen resulting in death.

Epizootics of VEE have also resulted in the deaths of other animals such
as, rabbits, goats, dogs, and sheep.

The differential diagnosis may include eastern or western equine
encephalomyelitis (EEE and WEE), Japanese encephalitis, West Nile fever,
leucoencephalomalacia due to moldy corn intoxication (_Fusarium_ spp.),
rabies, tetanus, African horse sickness, bacterial meningitis, and toxic
poisoning.

Humans and horses are infected by a wide variety of mosquito vectors,
including _Culex_, _Mansonia_, _Psorophora_, and _Aedes_ species. The
principal vector for humans is _Aedes aegypti_. Humans acquire infection as
an incidental dead-end infection of the normal animal-mosquito-animal cycle
in nature. Blood viral loads of infected patients may exceed the threshold
level required to infect mosquitoes, and human-mosquito-human transmission
has been suspected in some epidemics.

The potential for person-to-person transmission exists. Venezuelan equine
encephalitis (VEE) virus has been isolated from human pharynx Furthermore,
aerosol transmission of the virus has occurred as a result of laboratory
accidents or lack of laboratory precautions.

In people symptoms of VEE range from a mild flu-like illness to severe
systemic disease, encephalitis, and death.

This disease is clearly zoonotic, and people should protect themselves, as
they would from West Nile virus or the other encephalopathy diseases:
avoiding dusk and dawn, wearing long sleeves, and using insect repellant
containing DEET.
