The Forest Grove School District has released preliminary results from tests made for lead in drinking water fixtures at all of their schools. According to the district, "results from Gales Creek, Tom McCall East, Forest Grove High School, Harvey Clarke Elementary, Neil Armstrong Middle School and the Taylor Way building indicate there are a few fixtures with elevated levels of lead." Of more than 400 fixtures tested, 11 tested positive for elevated levels of lead.

According to Dick Reid with Pixis Labs, the company testing the school district's samples for lead, there are additional samples that are still being tested. More samples will be taken next week from Forest Grove area schools, according to Sally Koch, owner of Indy Safety, Inc, another company that is getting samples from local schools.

Update 2:18 pm 15 Jul [2016]: We're adding the next steps the school district will be taking below. The full news release can be found http://www.fgsd.k12.or.us/pages/ForestGroveSD/News/Preliminary_Results_for_Distri.

- Turn off all faucets that have tested positive for elevated levels of lead.
- Provide bottled water in the identified areas as needed.
- Replace identified fixtures/pipes where necessary to reduce lead levels.
- Re-test affected areas.

Students, staff and the community will be notified when the issue has been resolved. Calls to the Forest Grove School District have not yet been returned. We will update the article if and when they get back to us.

[It is nice to know that municipalities are taking seriously the issue of lead in water, especially at schools. But the number of schools reporting lead should make each municipality examine their own water testing program.

A number of things are in play but do not appear to be getting resolved:
1.- While water fountains and lavatories are being shut down when a lead test is high; there is no indication as to whether it is the water fountain, parts in it or the pipes that supply it. The same is true with the lavatory fixtures.
2.- Has anyone questioned the equipment and method the laboratory is using to test the water? New equipment for this in a lab is very expensive and labs are loathed to invest in new equipment for this test. These instruments may not be getting down to the level that is really needed.
3.- Try sending water samples to a variety of labs and comparing the data based upon the type of equipment in each lab.

It would be nice to have a report showing what is being done to the drinking fountains being taken out of service. Is it the pipes and fittings in the fountain? Or are the pipes leading to the fountain? Or is it really the water which would be a much broader problem. - Mod.TG
