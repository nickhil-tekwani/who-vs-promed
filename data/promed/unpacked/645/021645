Thirteen ferret-badgers were confirmed to be infected with rabies yesterday [3 Aug 2013], breaking the record for the highest number of confirmed rabies cases within a day, according to the Council of Agriculture (COA). According to the COA, there have been a total of 35 confirmed cases of ferret-badgers with rabies as well as one house shrew since the 1st rabies case was discovered.

The COA said that Chiayi County became the 7th area with confirmed rabies cases, along with Kaohsiung City, Taitung County, Nantou County, Taichung City, Tainan City and Yunlin County. The 13 newly confirmed ferret-badgers with rabies, the COA said, were discovered [among] the 33 animal samples, including house shrews, squirrels and bats, but only those 13 ferret-badgers tested positive for rabies. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) chief Chang Feng-yee said that it is not a surprise that all the rabies-infected cases are ferret-badgers. "There might be more ferret-badgers confirmed to carry the rabies virus," Chang said, "but people should not panic about the increasing number of rabies cases." Chang Shu-hsien, head of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ), said that even though the number of rabies cases dramatically increased, the government still has the situation under control.

Alishan, one of the popular tourists spots for domestic and international travelers, became one of the 3 areas in Chiayi County to have rabies-infected ferret-badgers. Chan Shu-hsien said that the COA has issued a notice to ban tourists from bringing pets to all the forest recreation areas and national parks. "All the local animal disease centers have personnel touring around mountain areas to give pets rabies vaccinations," Chang Shu-hsien said, "and some of the centers are currently short-handed."

Chang Shu-hsien said that all local governments can work with instructors and students from local schools and universities of veterinary sciences to assist with the vaccinations and the BAPHIQ will reimburse part of the cost. According to Chang Shu-hsien, the BAPHIQ immediately provided nearly 10 000 rabies vaccines for animals to those areas where newly confirmed rabies cases were discovered, including Chiayi County. Chang Feng-yee yesterday [3 Aug 2013] said that people who have been bitten or scratched by ferret-badgers from May 2012 to 31 Jul 2013 can receive publicly funded rabies vaccinations after evaluations.

This new policy originally targeted people who were bitten or scratched between August 2012 and July 2013, according to Chang Feng-yee, but considering the 1st rabies-infected ferret-badger was discovered last May [2012], the CDC decided to extend the period that this new policy covers.

Another 4 wild Formosan ferret-badgers have tested positive for rabies, health authorities said Monday [5 Aug 2013], bringing the number of confirmed infections in animals in Taiwan to 40 since an outbreak was reported in mid-July 2013. The 4 rabies-infected ferret-badgers were among a group of 14 animal corpses tested Sunday [4 Aug 2013], the Central Epidemic Command Center for Rabies said.

The 4 confirmed infections came respectively from Taichung's Dongshi district, Nantou County's Puli Township, Yunlin County's Gukeng Township and Taitung County's Haiduan Township, the center said. These were the 1st infections confirmed in Dongshi and Haiduan, putting those 2 districts on the list of rabies-affected areas for the 1st time, the center said. As of Sun 4 Aug 2013, all of the confirmed rabies cases had been Formosan ferret-badgers, with the exception of a singular Asian house shrew.

Including the newest additions, rabies has been recorded in 28 districts and townships in 7 cities and counties across central and southern Taiwan, the center said.

[Despite the escalation in the number of confirmed cases of rabies infected Formosan ferry-badgers in Taiwan, the infection appears still to be confined to these animals, with the exception of a single human exposure and one deceased house shrew. It is becoming increasingly likely that rabies virus infection has been present in Taiwanese ferret-badgers for some time in view of the widespread distribution of the rabies-virus-infected ferret-badgers identified so far. The absence of cases of rabies in other animals indicates the ecological isolation of these animals. Hopefully, the rapid response of the local authorities in spreading knowledge of the outbreak, together with the provision of free vaccination, will confine the outbreak to the ferret-badger population.
