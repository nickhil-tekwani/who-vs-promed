After 17 Mar 2010, locally acquired chikungunya cases have been
identified on Reunion Island. Epidemiological surveillance has been
enhanced in several areas based on the geographic location of
confirmed cases. This surveillance consists of
- rapid identification of new suspected chikungunya cases for quicker
action by the service to fight vectors;
- following the dynamics of the epidemiological situation on Reunion.

After 14 Apr [2010], date of the last Point Epidemiologique, 13
additional chikungunya cases have been confirmed as well as 4
probable cases. In total, as of 21 Apr [2010], these surveillance
approaches permitted the identification of:
- 38 chikungunya cases confirmed (by RTPCR or seroconversion)
- 11 probable cases (serological testing positive for IgM associated
with a dengue-like syndrome).

As the map of these cases shows, 21 confirmed and 10 probable cases
are grouped in the area of the Caillou Plateau. In
Saint-Gilles-les-Bains 7 cases have been confirmed, 4 with family
connections. Investigations are under way to determine the existence
of a focus of transmission. Isolated cases have been confirmed in
other areas of Saint-Paul (7) as well as Salazie (1) and Avirons (1).

After 17 Mar (2010), the date when the 1st chikungunya case was
identified on Reunion Island, the number of confirmed cases on
Plateau Caillou has not ceased to increase. This situation has
translated into the presence of a persistent epidemiological focus
[of transmission] despite the intervention of anti-vector teams in the area.
