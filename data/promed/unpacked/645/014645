TAINTED WATER KILLS DIALYSIS PATIENTS
NEW YORK -- Researchers from the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia conclude in the current issue of The
New England Journal of Medicine that bacterial toxins in water used in
hemodialysis led to the deaths of 50 patients undergoing treatment at a
dialysis center in Brazil in 1996.
The patients died of acute liver failure within weeks of being exposed to
toxins in water trucked to the hemodialysis center from a nearby reservoir
during a drought.
The story cites National Kidney Foundation figures estimating that some
217,000 Americans are currently on hemodialysis.
The outbreak occurred in late February of 1996. One hundred and one
patients at a dialysis center in Caruaru, Brazil, experienced vision
trouble, nausea, and vomiting soon after hemodialysis.
Investigators traced the source of illness to tainted water that had been
trucked to the clinic during a period of drought. This water had not been
filtered or chlorinated, and the researchers say it contained
microcystinspotent toxins produced by naturally-occurring blue-green algae
cyanobacteria.
