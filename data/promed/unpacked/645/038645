[Given reports of LSD virus circulation in neighboring countries, the finding in cattle for the first time in Georgia is not surprising.

Lumpy skin disease is a poxviral disease with significant morbidity in cattle. Although the mortality rate is generally low, losses occur from decreased milk production, abortion, infertility, loss of condition and damaged hides.

For a general overview of the LSD situation in the area, please refer to the "disease outbreak maps" for the dates 1 May 2014 to 8 Nov 2016 at http://tinyurl.com/nm7z7zs.

There is no evidence that the virus can affect humans. - Mod.CRD
