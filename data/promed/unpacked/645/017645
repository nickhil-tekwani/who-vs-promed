[1] Indonesia (Banten): avian influenza human (H5N1 suspected) request for information

Testing has found a father and son from Tangerang, Banten [province], died after contracting the bird flu virus. The father and son died on 24 Mar 2015 and on 26 Mar 2015, respectively, after spending the past week hospitalized in Tangerang and East Jakarta with severe fevers and other flu-like symptoms.

"The result from our laboratory showed that the 2 victims tested positive for avian flu," said Tjandra Yoga Aditama, chief of the Health Ministry's research and development office on Fri 27 Mar 2015. On 8 Mar 2015, the pair, along with other family members, visited the Bogor home of a relative who owns a small poultry farm, state-owned news agency Antara reported. During their stay one of the fowl reportedly died due to unknown reasons.

However, it is not yet clear how or from where the pair contracted the virus, or which strain they have been diagnosed with. Cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, are relatively rare in humans, but usually occur following direct or close contact with poultry.

Symptoms can include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches to severe respiratory illness, among others. In severe cases it can lead to death. Other members of the family -- a woman and child -- have been tested and found negative for the virus, Tjandra said.

[In mid-June 2014, Indonesia reported 197 cases of human avian influenza infections, making it the country with the highest number of H5N1 cases at that time. Egypt and Viet Nam followed with 175 and 127 cases, respectively. In 2015, Egypt leads the world with the greatest number of H5N1 cases, with no cases reported yet this year (2015) from Indonesia, with the possible exception of these 2 cases. No information is available on the actual strain of avian influenza that led to the death of these 2 individuals, although H5N1 is suspected from the circumstances. Nonetheless, with the number of avian influenza strains circulating in bird populations, other possibilities certainly exist and ProMED welcomes any further information a knowledgeable source may have on the details of the viral strain implicated in these 2 fatal cases.

Avian influenza is an infectious viral disease that routinely affects birds. The 1st H5N1 human infection was documented in China in 1997. Transmission of the virus is from bird to bird, through contact with saliva, mucosal secretions, or feces. However, transmission can also occur from bird to human in situations where individuals have close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence that it can be spread through properly cooked food products.

[2] Egypt (Sohag): avian influenza human H5N1 fatality
Date: Sun 29 Mar 2015

A 27-year old woman who raised birds in her home in the Sohag governorate, died of bird flu on Sun 29 Mar 2015.

Tahta Fevers Hospital received the victim, who was suffering from bird flu symptoms, before she was transferred to Assiut Fevers Hospital upon the request of her family, according to a medical source at Tahta hospital.

A medical team inspected the woman's house in Tahta and conducted tests on those who were in contact with the woman as a preventive measure.

The Al-Arabiya news website quoted Local Development Minister Adel Labib on 11 Mar 2015 as saying that the total bird flu death toll in Egypt since the start of the winter season in September 2014 amounted to 33 victims.

The largest number of victims during that time were in Sharqiya with 10 deaths, followed by Assiut with 7 victims, according to Labib.

The spread of the H5N1 virus is facilitated by the large number of unlicensed poultry farms outside the scope of supervision by the Agriculture Ministry, in addition to the lack of awareness among people who breed birds in their houses.

The death rate from bird flu is 37.4 percent in Egypt, compared to 55 percent on the international level, particularly in China.

According to the State Information Service, around 2 million people working in the poultry industry and 8 million of their relatives have been affected since the emergence of bird flu in Egypt.

[While the number of deaths (33) in this report is close to the number reported by WHO (17 Mar 2015, and ProMED Avian influenza, human (77): China report week 12, H5N1, Viet Nam, Egypt 20150326.3255017), the number of cases estimated from the reported death rate of 37.4 per cent is significantly lower than that reported by WHO, that is, 116 cases (36 deaths) for the year. FluTrackers lists this case as number 120, closer to the WHO record for H5N1 in Egypt. Using the WHO count, the death rate would actually be lower than 37.4 per cent, rather 32.2 per cent, which is good news. But it is not at all clear where the cause for the discrepancy in tallies lies.

WHO's International Health Regulations (IHR) which went into effect in June 2007, are an international legal instrument that is binding on 196 countries across the globe, including all the Member States of WHO. Their aim is to help the international community prevent and respond to acute public health risks that have the potential to cross borders and threaten people worldwide. The regulations require countries to report certain disease outbreaks and public health events to WHO. Therefore, one might expect a count from Egyptian media closer to that reported by WHO.
