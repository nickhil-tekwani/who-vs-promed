National Park Service (NPS) veterinarians recently confirmed the presence of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in a buck white-tailed deer at Devils Tower National Monument [Wyoming]. CWD is endemic to free-ranging deer populations throughout much of eastern Wyoming, and although this is the 1st animal to test positive for CWD at Devils Tower, it is not the 1st case in Crook County. That case was detected only a few miles away, in 2008.

Although hunting is not permitted at Devils Tower, this is the 1st deer tested from surrounding Hunt Area 1 that has tested positive for CWD. Deer Hunt Area 1 is bordered on 3 sides by other CWD positive deer Hunt Areas: 2, 3, and 18.

"We will continue to work with our state partners as we monitor deer populations at Devils Tower, and will have suspect animal carcasses tested for CWD. Park visitors are encouraged to report any sick or dead animals to park staff," said Superintendent Tim Reid. Signs of CWD include poor body condition, abnormal behavior, and excessive salivation.

Wyoming Game and Fish Personnel annually collect and analyze more than 1600 CWD samples throughout the state, but hunters who are unable to participate in the department's CWD surveillance program may have their deer, elk or moose tested by contacting the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab at (307) 766-9925. Hunters should be aware that it may take a few weeks after their animal is sampled to get their test results.

[We generally post reports of chronic wasting disease from areas that represent an expansion of the disease. This particular animal seems to be in an area that has already had CWD. However, it may be in a designated hunt area that is different, but it is within the same county. It is unclear from this source, and several others, if this CWD animal is the 1st in this county since 2008. It is unlikely, but it is unclear. - Mod.TG
