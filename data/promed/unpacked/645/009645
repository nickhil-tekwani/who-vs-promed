Lithuania: Human Death and Epidemiological Situation
----------------------------------------------------
Human Death
-----------
In March 2004, a 5-year-old boy died from rabies in Lithuania. The
boy originated from the district of Prienai (southern Lithuania) but
had lived in the city of Alytus, also in the south of the country,
since November 2003. On 21 Feb 2004 he fell ill with chills. The next
day he had a fever (40 deg C). On 23 Feb 2004 the boy was admitted to
Alytus city hospital, where he was diagnosed with an acute viral
respiratory infection, acute nasopharyngitis, and hyperthermia. On 24
Feb 2004, he was admitted to the Vilnius University Children's
Hospital, where he was diagnosed with acute viral respiratory
infection, acute nasopharyngitis, acute encephalitis and
neurotoxicosis. He became aggressive, anxious, and was
hypersalivating. All investigations (blood analysis, blood
electrolytes and glucose, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, herpes virus
test, blood culture, and a brain magnetic resonance scan) were
negative or did not show any pathology.
At a meeting of neurologists and infectious disease specialists, it was
agreed that symptomatic treatment for the acute progressive encephalitis was
having no effect, and so a diagnosis of rabies was not excluded. The boy died
on 10 Mar 2004. Final diagnosis was: rabies, not specified; complication: CNS
activity deficiency. On 12 Mar 2004, laboratory results were received: rabies
infection had been confirmed by immunofluorescence. This case was reported
beyond Lithuania (1). [See ProMED-mail: Rabies, human - Lithuania: RFI
20040316.0728].
Epidemiological Situation
-------------------------
Specialists from Vilnius and the regional public health centres
undertook an epidemiological investigation to try to detect possible
contacts of the patient with domestic and wild animals. The Alytus
County department of the State Food and Veterinary Service
(<http://www.vet.lt>) reported that between October and December
2003, there had been 11 animal rabies cases detected in the city of
Alytus and surrounding county: one case in the city and 10 cases in
the county (3 foxes, 5 mongooses, and 3 cows). In 2004 so far, there
have been 7 registered animal cases in Alytus county (2 foxes, 5
mongooses, a dog and a cat).
Prienai district State Food and Veterinary Service reported that
between October and December 2003, there were 2 detected animal
rabies cases: in a dog and a mongoose, and these cases were
registered 8-9 km from where the boy had been living. In 2004, no
animal rabies cases have so far been detected in Prienai district.
According to the patient's parents, in November 2003 in Prienai, a
piglet died from unknown causes. It was not examined by a vet and was
buried.
The patient's parents reported no contact between the patient and
domestic or wild animals, and no injury.
In recent years, the epidemiological and epizootiological rabies
situation in Lithuania has worsened. Rabies cases in wild and
domestic animals have been notified in all regions. Every year [from
1996 to 2003], a great number of people are injured by various wild
and domestic animals, and the threat of rabies virus infection for
humans has increased (Table 1 - see website above). Many people are
bitten by healthy and by infected dogs. 6 percent of people seeking
medical advice following animal injuries in 2003 had been bitten by
dogs infected with rabies (with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis).
(Table 2 - see website above). Since 1994, the procedure for
post-exposure vaccination in Lithuania has been rabies vaccine and
human immunoglobulin. According to State Food and Veterinary Service
data for 2003, 1108 animal cases of rabies were registered in all
regions of Lithuania (an increase of 175 cases compared with 2002).
There were 796 registered cases in wild animals (71.8 percent) and
312 cases in domestic animals (28.2 percent) (Table 3).
Table 3. Animal Rabies Cases 2000-2003
Year / Total / Domestic animals / Wild animals
2000 / 850 / 285 / 565
2001 / 677 / 192 / 485
2002 / 933 / 682 / 251
2003 /1108 / 312 / 796
Regional branches of the State Food and Veterinary Service collect
data on rabid or suspected animals and send samples to the National
Veterinary Laboratory. The National State Food and Veterinary Service
is informed by the regions through the monthly return of forms.
In wild animals, rabies was detected in foxes (378 cases), raccoons
(299), martens (81), ferrets (18), badgers (11), roes (3), lynxes
(2), mink, beavers, otters, bats, hamsters (1 case each). Cases among
domestic animals were registered in cows (152), cats (81), dogs (65),
horses (12), and goats (2).
Cats and dogs are vaccinated regularly, whereas cows are only
vaccinated in areas where there is a concentration of rabies cases.
In 2003, 201 638 dogs, 31 262 cats, 34 670 cows, and 1694 other
animals received prophylactic vaccination. Between 2000 and 2003,
vaccination of foxes using baits was discontinued due to a lack of
financial resources.
Deaths from rabies in Lithuania are registered every 3 to 4 years.
There were 11 human deaths between 1960 and 2004; 7 of these patients
had contact with wild rabid animals and 3 with domestic rabid
animals. The source of infection for the patient in 2004 remains unknown
(Table 4).

Region / Year / Number of cases / Source of virus
Vilnius / 1960 / 1 / 1 Dog
Kaisiadoriu district / 1962 / 1 Fox
Svencioniu district / 1965 / 1 Raccoon-dog
Kedainiu district / 1972 / 1 Badger
Traku district / 1979 / 1 Fox
Joniskio district / 1992 / 1 Raccoon-dog
Traku district / 1992 / 1 Dog
Traku district / 1993 / 1 Cat
Kedainiu district / 1997 / 1 Fox
Pasvalio district / 2000 / 1 Fox
Prienu district / 2004 / 1 Unknown
If a human case of rabies is suspected, an immediate report is sent
to the regional public health centre, and the Centre for Communicable
Diseases Prevention and Control. Epidemiologists from regional public
health centres undertake the investigation.
In 2002, a Rabies Epidemiological and Epizootiological Surveillance
and Control Programme was approved. According to this programme, wild
fauna rabies vaccination will be funded across all regions of
Lithuania. Financial support is also promised by Phare management
committee (The Phare programme is one of the pre-accession projects
financed by European Community. It assists applicant countries in
preparing to join the European Union,
<http://europa.eu.int/comm/enlargement/pas/phare/>), and this support
will be used for oral wild animal vaccination. This programme will
also be implemented in the neighbouring countries of Latvia, Poland,
and Belarus. A rabies surveillance programme will also be set up, and
with these measures, the number of rabid wild animals should be
reduced.
