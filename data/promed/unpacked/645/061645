About 1.5 tons of obsolete toxic agents have been discovered in
Primorye, Yakovlevskiy district, by the department of Agriculture of
Primorye region. Administrative officials, in particular Vitaliy
Salenko, considers them dangerous for the environment. Toxic agents
were discovered in Novosisoyevka village during the pesticide and
agricultural toxic agents control activities. According to Salenko,
the agents discovered are stored in damaged packaging and are a
source of chemical and ecological danger. Currently, specialists are
identifying the owner of those agents.

[The storage of obsolete toxic agents is a heritage of the former
Soviet system. Not all countries have resources for proper
liquidation of obsolete agents stored in warehouses or buried in a
manner that is risky for subsoil waters. - Mod.NR]

[Outdated, obsolete chemicals may include pesticides, insecticides,
household cleaners, industrial solvents, detergents and a host of
others substances. Some of these may be chemicals that have long been
withdrawn from the market because of health or environmental effects.
As this notice refers to agricultural chemicals, it is likely that
there are large amounts of pesticides for crops involved.

The problem with these large chemical dumps is that the containers
deteriorate over time, and a combination of chemicals seeps into the
ground and the ground water. It is unlikely that they would
neutralize each other but rather form a very toxic combination,
harmful to the environment, the water, the discoverers of these
sites, and local people. - Mod.TG]

[So far, no cases of any related illnesses have been reported. - Mod.JW]
