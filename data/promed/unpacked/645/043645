1st case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease reported in The Netherlands
------------------------------------------------------
The Netherlands reported its 1st human case of "mad cow" disease on Thu 21
Apr 2005 but said Dutch beef is safe to eat. The interior ministry declared
that a patient at a hospital in the central town of Utrecht had been
diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], the human form of "mad cow disease".
It said European authorities had been informed and the inspector of health
was investigating whether there was any risk that the disease could have
infected others. Around 150 cases of vCJD have been reported in the world,
most of them in Britain. There have also been cases in France, Ireland,
Italy, Japan, Canada, and the United States.
There have been more than 70 cases of "mad cow disease" or BSE [Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy] in animals in the Netherlands since 1997, but
the interior ministry said that Dutch beef was safe because all cattle were
tested for BSE. "Beef in the Netherlands is safe because all susceptible
cattle are tested for BSE at slaughter," the ministry said. The
brain-wasting disease known as vCJD, is fatal and incurable. It is thought
to be caused by eating food tainted with material from cattle with BSE, or
mad cow disease, which is a progressive neurological disorder.
The Netherlands announced strict new restrictions last year on blood
donation over concerns about the transmission of vCJD through blood
transfusion. BSE first emerged in British cattle in the 1980s and forced
the destruction of millions of animals. After assuring people beef was
safe, British officials later were forced to admit that some people
apparently were infected with a human version of BSE by eating certain
products.

[Confirmed cases of vCJD have been identified in the United Kingdom (155),
France (9), Italy (2), and Ireland (1). The case of vCJD in the Netherlands
brings the total of confirmed and suspected cases for Europe to 168. 4
other cases of vCJD have been confirmed in addition to these European
cases; one each in Canada, the Hong Kong SAR, Japan, and the USA, bringing
the total of suspected and confirmed cases worldwide to 172. The 4
non-European cases, however, had periods of residence in Britain and may
have contracted the disease there. Suspected cases have been reported also
from the Czech Republic, Guadeloupe, New Zealand, Russia, Spain and South
Africa, but none has been confirmed so far. - Mod.CP]
