An outbreak of Q fever, a rare illness in Brazil, is being investigated by the [Minas Gerais] State Secretariat of Health. Between June 2010 and February 2013, 81 suspected cases were notified in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte and in April 2013, 6 patients were seropositive for the illness.

Q fever is a zoonosis that is more common in countries such as the USA, France, Portugal, and the Netherlands. The Netherlands, in recent years, had thousands of human cases confirmed.

Human infection is caused by direct contact, inhalation of aerosolized secretions of the infected animal, or by the consumption of raw milk. Tania Martial, coordinator of the Minas Gerais Center for Strategic Information in Health Surveillance (CIEVS), however, affirms that the majority of patients with suspected [Q fever] did not have contact with the animal reservoirs of the illness. "As a precaution we are continuing with the inquiry", she said.

Elba Lemos of the National Reference Laboratory for Rickettsial Diseases of the Oswaldo Cruz (IOC/Fiocruz) Institute said, "Any assertion regarding a possible outbreak will depend on the results of the analyses presently being done in the laboratory." She added that the 1st description of Q fever in Brazilian territory was in 1953, identified by serology in Sao Paulo. Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, and Tocantins have diagnosed cases in the past. "More recently, in Minas Gerais and in Rio de Janeiro, antibodies against Q fever were found in 16 and 4 patients, respectively, from serological tests.

[Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance.

_Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation, and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant, and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission, are rare.
