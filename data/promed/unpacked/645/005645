Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda - WHO Update 39
--------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 16 Jan 2001, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported the
following:
Gulu district: One new confirmed case has been detected. The case is a
close contact of the patient who died on 4 Jan 2001. The cumulative total
number of cases is now 396 cases and 150 deaths.
Masindi district: No new cases have been reported since 19 Dec 2000. The
cumulative total number of cases remains 27 cases and 19 deaths.
WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from Uganda.
A team consisting of WHO, health authorities from the Ministry of Health of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF)
has investigated rumours of similar outbreaks in Bunia, DRC as
indicated. They have found no evidence of viral haemorrhagic fever. The
team reviewed procedures for dealing with suspected cases and identified
and trained local sampling and investigation teams.

[The first part of this report appears to duplicate WHO Update 38 (posted
as Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Uganda (04)), which also recorded the death
toll in Gulu to be 150 on 9 Jan 2001, following the death of one additional
patient.
Now there would appear to be no substance to the reports of suspected cases
of Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but it is
not clear from the WHO statement whether laboratory tests have been
undertaken. - Mod.CP

Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Uganda Almost Over?
--------------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: A Ugandan health officials said on Tue 16 Jan 2001 that they were
confident a 4-month epidemic of the deadly Ebola haemorrhagic fever was
almost over, despite the finding of a new case this week in the northern
town of Gulu. "That one new case can again cause a problem, cause a
flare-up, so we are keeping our fingers crossed," Sam Okware, the
Commissioner for Health Services, told reporters in the capital,
Kampala. "But we are now in the evening of the epidemic."
Health workers said the latest case was a grandmother who had already lost
her daughter and her 5-month-old granddaughter to the haemorrhagic
fever. After her daughter died in Dec [2000, the grandmother took over
the care of the baby. "When the mother was sick, health workers tested the
baby and found she tested antigen-negative for Ebola virus, so they felt
able to release her back to her village," Alex Opio, the Assistant
Commissioner for National Disease Control, said. But the baby then died in
early Jan [2000, and probably passed the disease on to her grandmother,
officials said.
The official death toll from the epidemic, which was first spotted in
mid-Sept [2000, now stands at 173, of which 150 people have died in Gulu
district, from where it spread to 2 other districts before being contained.
Mbarara district, where 4 Ebola fever deaths occurred in Nov [2000, was
declared free of the virus in late Dec [2000 after passing a 42-day
deadline (twice the maximum incubation period) with no new cases.
The third district, Masindi, has had no new cases for nearly 5 weeks. "If
nothing new happens there by 24 Jan 2001, we should be able to declare
Masindi free of Ebola," Okware said.
At the epidemic's peak in late Oct [2000, hospitals in Gulu were admitting
up to 17 new patients each day. But the number of cases has fallen
steadily since then as the government, with help from the World Health
Organisation and other international agencies, launched a well-orchestrated
public awareness campaign and stepped up medical care.
