The Florida Department of Health in Lee County confirms that there is an outbreak of adenovirus in Lee County. Citing HIPPA [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act], the department would not say where specifically this is happening. An outbreak is when 2 or more cases in the same geographic location happen -- defined as the same wing of a school, hospital, or nursing home, for example -- according to the Florida Department of Health in Lee County.

A letter was sent to parents, faculty, and staff at St Andrews Catholic School in Cape Coral on [Thu 30 Apr 2015] saying students were absent due to the adenovirus. The letter notes an intention to keep the school open -- and reminds to practice frequent hand-washing and sanitizing. It also states a cleaning service was contacted to sanitize the school.

Adenovirus is a common cause of respiratory disease, most often known as the common cold and symptoms often include sore throat, bronchitis, and diarrhea. Most people don't know they have adenovirus because physicians rarely test when a patient comes to them with a cold, health officials said.
