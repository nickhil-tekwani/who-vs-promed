Dengue Fever Arrives Early in Phuket, Thailand
----------------------------------------------
PHUKET: The Phuket Provincial Health Office (PHO) has warned that there is
an increased risk of dengue fever infection this year. Between 1 Jan 2001
and 26 Jan 2001, 11 cases of dengue fever were reported in Phuket, all in
the Muang and Thalang districts. The highest number of patients was
reported in Tambon Rassada, followed by Tambon Wichit and Tambon Mai Khao.
No cases have been reported in the main tourist areas on the west coast of
Phuket, and there have been no reported deaths from this mosquito-borne
disease.
Normally, dengue fever does not become prevalent until May, and does not
peak until the rainy season, from June to August, though the onset of the
fever also began early in 1999. The number of reported cases per year tends
to peak every second year. Children aged 10 to 14 years of age are most at
risk of contracting the disease, followed by children between 5 and 9, and
then young people between 15 to 24 years of age. So far, there have been no
reports of infections in children under 5 or adults of 44 or older.
To stop the spread of the disease, the PHO recommends preventing mosquito
larvae from developing in stagnant water, by frequently changing the water
in open storage containers and by keeping fish in pools.

of dengue fever in Thailand. - Mod.CP
