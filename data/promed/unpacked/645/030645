A multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections is linked to salads produced in Illinois, federal officials announced Thursday.

An investigation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration found that 8 _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections -- at least 5 in Illinois and 3 in Wisconsin -- may have been caused by eating BrightFarms Sunny Crunch salad produced at a greenhouse in Rochelle.

According to the CDC, the number of cases is likely higher, as some people recover without seeing a doctor or ever being tested for _Salmonella_, and the outbreak may have spread beyond areas where it has already been identified. The most recent illness onset was [Tue 15 Jun 2021], according to the FDA.

Labeled "fresh from Rochelle, IL," the Sunny Crunch brand packaged salads have been distributed to Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin, according to the company, which grows produce hydroponically at its Ogle County facility.

"Growing in a greenhouse allows for control over everything in and around the greens, so you can trust your salad is ready to eat, right out of the box," according to its website. "While field-grown greens might say 'triple-washed' -- BrightFarms greens are clean from farm to table. No rinsing required."

Federal regulators advised members of the public not to buy, serve or eat the Sunny Crunch salad, a hybrid of both iceberg and green leaf lettuce. "Throw it away or return it to where you bought it," the CDC recommended. "Even if some of the salad was eaten and no one got sick, throw the rest away or return it."

Symptoms of _Salmonella_, a bacterial infection, include diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps and usually begin within a week of exposure. Most people recover without treatment after 4 to 7 days, according to public health officials. Children, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems are at risk of more severe illnesses that may require medical intervention. There have been no _Salmonella_ hospitalizations or deaths linked to this outbreak, according to the FDA.

Salmonella Outbreak Linked to BrightFarms Sunny Crunch Salad
----------------------------------------

Fast Facts
Illnesses: 8
Hospitalizations: 0
Deaths: 0
States: 2
Recall: No
Investigation status: Active

The CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the FDA are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium infections. Epidemiologic and traceback data show that BrightFarms brand Sunny Crunch salad may be contaminated with _Salmonella_ and may be making people sick.

As of 14 Jul 2021, 8 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 2 states, Illinois 5 and Wisconsin 3. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 10 Jun 2021 to 15 Jun 2021. Sick people range in age from 31 to 61 years, with a median age of 46, and 63% are female. No hospitalizations or deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Officials from Illinois and Wisconsin interviewed people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick and collected shopper card records to determine what products they bought. All 8 people reported eating leafy greens, and 7 (88%) people reported eating prepackaged salads. The percentage of people in this outbreak who ate prepackaged salads was significantly higher than the 38% of respondents from the FoodNet Population Survey. This comparison suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from eating prepackaged salads.

Interview data and shopper card records show that 5 people ate or bought BrightFarms brand Sunny Crunch salad before they got sick. FDA conducted a traceback investigation and identified the farm in Rochelle, IL, as the likely source of the BrightFarms brand Sunny Crunch salad bought by sick people.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

WGS analysis of 5 people's samples did not predict resistance to any antibacterials. Standard antibacterial susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently underway.
