Dublin: Outbreak of Vomiting Virus Infection Still Causing Chaos
------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of the winter vomiting virus illness at Dublin's Beaumont
hospital is now affecting more than 70 patients following the confirmation
of 18 new cases over the weekend. Of the hospital's 19 wards, 17 are
affected by the virus.
All elective surgical and medical procedures have been postponed, and a
hospital spokesman said it will inevitably take a number of weeks before
the outbreak can be contained. Restrictions on visiting are still in place.

Chesterfield: Warning over Outbreak of Vomiting Disease at Hospital
-------------------------------------------------
Doctors have issued a warning about a virus [infection] at a Chesterfield
hospital. Staff at Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Royal Hospital NHS
Trust say the infection, confirmed in laboratory tests [presumably as a
Norwalk-like virus - Mod.CP], was not serious, but anyone with diarrhoea or
vomiting should stay away.
After around 40 staff and patients fell ill, 3 wards have been closed. The
wards will remain closed until there have been no new cases for 48 hours.
Hospital bosses say local people can play their part by staying away if
they suffer from stomach upsets. The illness clears up on its own after a
couple of days or so. Anyone with diarrhoea or vomiting should wash their
hands thoroughly with soap and hot water and avoid preparing food. They
should also make sure they take plenty of fluids.
If the illness lasts longer than 48 hours, sufferers should contact a
doctor. Chief executive Eric Morton said the ward closures should act to
contain the spread of infection. He said: "We have taken the right
decision. This will stop patients coming into infected areas and stop the
spread among staff. "We are already looking to Monday and are taking steps
to try to make sure we do not have to cancel any operations, but it is a
possibility." While the virus is not serious it can have a critical effect
in environments such as hospitals. Any patients whose operations need to be
cancelled will be told as soon as possible.

[Norwalk-like virus infection is becoming a recurrent feature of
health-care institutions and other closed communities, particularly in the
UK and Ireland. Future reports of Norwalk-like virus infection will be
combined as occasional updates under the new genus designation _Norovirus_.
