Infection with ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariant, United Kingdom
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 12 Aug 2014 from Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 23 Jul 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 6 Aug 2014
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 22 Nov 2013
Causal agent: _Ostreid herpesvirus microvariant _ (OsHV-1, Var)
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Hukbridge, River Crouch, Essex, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 23 Jul 2014
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Water type: Salt water
Population type: Farmed
Production system: Open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Pacific Oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / 90 percent / 90 percent / - / 0 / 0
Affected population: Farmed population of diploid juvenile Pacific oysters, _Crassostrea gigas_, grown on inter-tidal estuarine site. Only juvenile oysters were clinically affected, although adult oysters also tested positive for the virus by PCR and sequencing.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Movement controls are being applied to the designated affected area to prevent the spread of infection. Under conditions of the designation:
- The control measures apply to Pacific oysters _Crassostrea gigas_ only;
- Movements of Pacific oysters _Crassostrea gigas_ for farming, relay or purification outside the designated area are prohibited;
- Movements of Pacific oysters _Crassostrea gigas_ are permitted to purification centres within the designated area;
- Subject to hygiene regulations, molluscan shellfish of any species can be taken from the area for direct human consumption;
- Disposal of dead Pacific oysters _Crassostrea gigas_ of all stages must be by an approved method for disposal of Category 2 animal-by-product waste.

An epidemiological investigation into the possible routes of infection is underway.

Control measures
Measures applied: zoning; emergency harvest; tracing forward; tracing back; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) (National laboratory) / Pacific Oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_) / real-time (PCR) / 6 Aug 2014 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 (OsHV-1) microvariants is considered a viral infection of bivalve molluscs caused by ostreid herpesvirus 1 microvariants.

Mortality associated with OsHV-1 microvariants has been reported in the Pacific oyster, _Crassostrea gigas_, and in the Portuguese cupped oyster, _C. angulate_.

The Pacific oyster and the Portuguese cupped oyster are naturally infected by microvariants. Young stages, including larvae, spat and juveniles, seem to be more susceptible to the infection. The virus is easier to detect in moribund animals than in apparently healthy animals.

Microvariants have been reported associated with Pacific oyster mass mortalities in Europe (France, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, UK), Australia, New Zealand, and Korea but is known to be detected elsewhere in the absence of oyster mortalities (e.g. Japan).

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2013, chapter 2.4.9, "Infection with ostreid herpesvirus 1 microvariant" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.4.09_INF_OSTREID_HERPES.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014).

The Pacific oyster is the most important species of oyster cultivated in the United Kingdom, both in terms of volume and value, with an annual production of over 1100 tonnes. Production greatly exceeds that of the native oyster, _Ostrea edulis_. Oyster herpesvirus has devastated Pacific oyster production in France, Jersey and in parts of Ireland, and it is important that the disease is contained to prevent its spread to other oyster growing areas in Great Britain http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/QA-oyster-herpesvirus-2013.pdf.

There are no implications for human health http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/QA-oyster-herpesvirus-2013.pdf.
