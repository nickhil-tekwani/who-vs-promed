Suspected Cases Show Specific Immune Responses to Avian Influenza Virus
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Japanese Health Ministry said today that at least one person had been
infected with avian influenza virus after an outbreak among chickens in Feb
2004, but there was no chance that this person would infect others. The
ministry said 4 others had probably also been infected with avian influenza
virus but added that none of the 5 had developed any symptoms of avian
influenza. The case marks the first human infection of avian influenza
virus in Japan, which reported several cases [outbreaks] of avian influenza
[in poultry] earlier this year.
"We think that one person has been infected," a Health Ministry official
told reporters, adding that chances were high that 4 others had also been
infected. The ministry had said on Sat 18 Dec 2004 that blood tests showed
that 5 people who were involved in work such as the culling of chickens
after an outbreak of avian influenza in Kyoto in western Japan in Feb 2004
had developed an antibody [an immune response] to the virus.
"The 5 people who tested positive for antibodies have not developed
symptoms of avian influenza and there is no risk of them developing
symptoms in the future. And there is no possibility they will infect
others," the Ministry said today. "We don't think it is a problem for
public health," the Ministry added.
All of avian influenza outbreaks in Japan have been identified as caused by
the H5N1-type virus, the virus thaas hit other countries in Asia and been
blamed for human deaths in Viet Namam and Thailand.

[These results appear to confirm that 5 poultry workers participating in
the culling of avian influenza virus-infected poultry in Feb 2004
experienced asymptomatic infection and exhibited specific immune responses.
It is not clear why one of the 5 is regarded as a confirmed case and the
other 4 as probable cases, nor why there has been a lapse of 10 months in
reporting this finding. Further clarification is awaited, in particular
regarding the nature of the diagnostic tests and the level of the immune
responses relative to a control population. This report emphasizes again
the need to obtain data on seroprevalence and seroconversions in the human
population of Thailand and Viet Nam exposed to outbreaks of avian influenza
in poultry in order to put the apparently high fatality rate in these
countries in perspective. - Mod.CP]
