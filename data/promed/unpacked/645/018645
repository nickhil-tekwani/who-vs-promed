Warning of major outbreak of coffee rust in El Salvador
-------------------------------------------------------
The Agricultural Suppliers Association (APA) of El Salvador today [18 Sep 2012] warned of a major outbreak of rust in coffee plantations in the country, a situation that also affects neighbouring Guatemala and Honduras. They said the national infection rate is around 30 percent, but in some areas has reached 60 percent. The biggest impact is reported in the western and northern areas.

The bad winter (rainy season from May to October) coupled with a lack of early warning led to perfect conditions for fungal growth. The outbreak is the worst in the last decade. The coffee harvest could be lower than expected, given the impact of rust.

Raul Zaldana, president of the Salvadoran Foundation for Coffee Research (Procafe), said the outbreak will have a "terrible impact", but said it was still too early to determine by how much production could be reduced.

Honduras coffee fungus outbreak could dent exports
--------------------------------------------------
Honduras, Central America's largest coffee producer, is facing an outbreak of leaf rust -- one of the world's most destructive coffee diseases -- that some fear could dent the 2012/2013 harvest. The disease currently blights around 10 percent of the planted crop, the national coffee institute IHCAFE [Honduran Coffee Institute] said.

Authorities are trying to contain the outbreak, sending fungicides and fertilizers to the roughly 20 000 growers in the 15 affected states, and distributing technical information on how to protect plantations against further damage.

"We know there will be some effect on coffee production, but we have new plots, planted within the last 3 years, that should bolster next year's harvest," said IHCAFE. "We're seeing higher-than-usual infection levels as a result of extreme weather and a slackening of growers' prevention efforts."

"It's almost certain that because of the outbreak, exports won't reach the expected [amount]. There are farms where they have thrown away all the leaves and the poorer producers don't have money to buy fungicides," [said a coffee exporter].

Unlike Brazil, which mainly grows robusta coffee, Honduras, like the rest of Central America and Mexico, mostly produces arabica beans.

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata but rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence in Central America of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, can be expected to make CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. In Guatemala, nearly 40 percent of the nation's coffee plantings were affected by the new strain in 2011/12 (ProMED-mail post 20120511.1129720). A 10 percent reduction in the country's production is expected for the current 2012/13 season.

A new more aggressive leaf rust strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773).
