Over 300 sheep and goats have died in mysterious circumstances at farms in
the Sakumkum area in Fujairah.
Although no cause has been discovered for the deaths, an official of the
Eastern Agricultural Zone said yesterday there was no evidence the animals
had died as the result of disease.
The owners of more than 10 sheep farms in the area have lost one third
of their stock of sheep and goats, although the animals had been
vaccinated and given medicine prescribed by local veterinarians.
Mohammed Obaid Ali, one of the affected farmers, said he had lost over 55
sheep and goats last week. He said he had no idea why they had died. He
said despite being given medicine, the animals became weak and suffered
from diarrhea and blisters which appeared on different parts of their bodies.
Rashid Mohammed Al Hafeeti, a 50-year-old farmer who lost around 45 sheep,
said: "Last week I noticed the sheep seemed to be sick. We asked a vet to
check our animals, but when he came he just looked at them and prescribed
medicine. He did not even give us an explanation of the sheep's disease."
Asked about the death of the sheep, Ibrahim Abdul Rahman, Director of the
Eastern Agricultural Zone in Fujairah, said: "We have been told of 340
cases of sheep infected with diseases in the Sakumkum area during January,
and a total of 7530 cases from other parts of Fujairah emirate. All cases
have been treated and the infected sheep were given vaccines and
medicine." He said the zone's 7 vets and 14 veterinary assistants pay
regular visits to all the farms in the region.
Abdul Rahman said fears of an outbreak of disease, such as foot and mouth
disease (FMD), were unfounded.
Instead, he blamed the farmers for the death of their animals, claiming
they do not follow the vets' instructions, do not give medicine in time, do
not get rid of the dirt and waste from inside their barns, and do not give
proper fodder to the animals.

[The number of animal deaths and the mention of blisters is alarming.
Although there are a number of vesicating diseases, the situation should be
investigated. Since no hint of what the medications or vaccinations were
for, there is no evidence indicating it was for the current disease. - Mod.TG]
