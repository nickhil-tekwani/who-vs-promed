Samoa announced it would shut down its government for 2 days so that public officials can combat a dangerous measles outbreak that has killed 53 people and infected 3728.

The Pacific island nation has raced to vaccinate its children and other residents since an outbreak was declared on [16 Oct 2019]. Its youngest citizens are at the greatest risk, as 48 of the deaths so far have been children under the age of 4.

On [Sun 1 Dec 2019], Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi announced "all public service and all government services will be closed" on [5 and 6 Dec 2019]. "in order to allow all public servants to assist with the mass vaccination campaign throughout the country."

The government's closure is the most drastic measure Samoa has taken to combat the outbreak so far. Officials have already begun a mass vaccination campaign aimed at young children and women of childbearing years, inoculating 58 150 people as of [Sun 1 Dec 2019]. Schools have been closed, children are banned from large public gatherings, and parents have been urged to bring their children to a doctor at the 1st signs of illness.

Several countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Britain, and China have sent medical experts and aid, and organizations like the Red Cross and UNICEF are also working to mitigate the outbreak. The US has dispatched a team of experts from the Centers for Disease Control to the island nation to help track the outbreak.

The story of Samoa's outbreak mirrors one unfolding around the world: a decrease in vaccination rates due to persistent disinformation about the safety of vaccines, combined with international travel, has sent measles rates skyrocketing, with outbreaks in countries where the disease had been thought eradicated. This year [2019], the United States has seen its worst measles outbreak since 1992, with 1261 cases reported between [1 Jan and 7 Nov 2019]. The majority of those infected were not vaccinated. Measles hot spots have emerged throughout Pacific countries where it was once eliminated, including Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.

Samoan officials say they believe the outbreak was initially spread by a traveler from New Zealand, the AP reported. Once in the country, the virus found a population with an uncommonly low vaccination rate.

Before the epidemic, Samoa's vaccination rate stood at only 31%, according to the World Health Organization [https://tinyurl.com/wgvw97n], and vaccination coverage has declined in Samoa since 2013, according to WHO and UNICEF data. Fears about the safety of the vaccine accelerated in 2018, after 2 babies in Samoa died when their vaccinations were mixed incorrectly, the BBC reported [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-50625680]

Noted anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr. visited the country in June 2019 and met with an Australian Samoan also involved in that effort, The Washington Post reported last week [https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/11/26/deadly-measles-outbreak-hits-children-samoa-after-anti-vaccine-fears/].

Now, the country is scrambling to vaccinate as much of its population of 196 000 as swiftly as possible.

On [Sun 1 Dec 2019], the prime minister urged Samoans to listen to medical experts and to put aside their fears of vaccines. "Let us work together to encourage and convince those that do not believe that vaccinations are the only answer to the epidemic," Tuilaepa said. "Let us not be distracted by the promise of alternative cures."

Authorities on the small South Pacific island said today [Mon 2 Dec 2019] that another 5 children have died in the outbreak, which saw a national emergency declared last month [October 2019]. The country - which has a population of 200 000 - has closed all of its schools and banned children from public gatherings. In all, 53 people have died in the outbreak since late October [2019], including one adult and 2 older teenagers. Most of those who have died have been babies and young infants, including 23 children aged less than one, and 25 children aged between 1 and 4.

The government said more than 1100 people had been admitted to hospital since the outbreak began. Some 180 people remain in hospital, including 19 children in a critical condition. Jordan von Heiderbrandt, whose son Peter was the 1st child to die, told The Guardian: "No one ever thinks about burying their children, you always think my children will bury me." Samoan authorities believe the virus was 1st spread by a traveller from New Zealand. Nanai Laveitiga Tuiletufuga, the Samoan Prime Minister's Office press secretary told Al Jazeera: "5 children died overnight. A total of 53 people have died. Of these, 50 were children under the age of 15 while 23 were babies aged less than one year old ... In the last 24 hours a further 198 cases have also been confirmed by the Ministry of Health." New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on [Mon 2 Dec 2019] her country was doing all it could to help curb the epidemic, including sending more than 50 medical professionals and thousands of vaccines to Samoa. Other countries including Britain have also sent teams and supplies. Ms Ardern said the natural curve of infection rates meant that 'sometimes things can be worse before they are better'.

[4] Fiji outbreak
Date: Sat 30 Nov 2019

In an update on the measles situation in Fiji, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services has reported an additional confirmed measles case. The most recent case, a 36 year old from Makosoi, Deuba in Serua/Namosi, is the 14th case reported to date.

Measles is very contagious. To help stop the spread of the disease, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services also advises Fijians in the strongest possible terms, to take the following precautions:

- Avoid non-essential travel to Serua/Namosi. This includes, but is not limited to, the areas of Wainadoi, Nabukavesi, Namosi, Navua, and Deuba. The Ministry of Health continues to hear about residents of Serua/Namosi planning for gatherings that will bring people from across the country and overseas. We advise in the strongest terms that until outbreak precautions are ceased in Serua/Namosi, all such gatherings should be deferred. This includes private celebrations such as weddings and family gatherings. If you need to travel to Serua/Namosi, please get vaccinated against measles at least 2 weeks before travel. Please avoid taking those that cannot get vaccinated (e.g. babies under the age of 6 months and pregnant women) to the outbreak area of Serua/Namosi.

- Avoid holding or attending large gatherings of people, especially in Central Division, but also those that bring participants from across the country or overseas (such as youth camps, religious gatherings, graduation ceremonies, sporting events, etc). Measles can spread very easily among large groups of people if they are not immune, who can then take the disease back into their communities.

- If you are holding an event with international visitors or participants from an outbreak area, please strongly encourage them to get vaccinated against measles at least 2 weeks before travel. This especially applies to visitors traveling from other countries with measles outbreaks i.e. New Zealand, Samoa and Tonga.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [Mon 2 Dec 2019] announced a case of measles infection, involving a 1-year-old boy with good past health. The CHP discovered this case during its medical surveillance for home contacts of a previously confirmed measles case announced earlier.

The boy developed a fever and rash since [29 Nov 2019]. He was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department at Queen Mary Hospital on the same day for medical advice and was admitted for treatment immediately. He was discharged on the [30 Nov 2019], and was admitted again today at Gleneagles Hong Kong Hospital for treatment.

A laboratory test of his respiratory specimen was positive for the measles virus. He is in a stable condition and has not yet received measles vaccination. He had no travel history during the incubation and communicable periods.

The patient lives with a previously confirmed case (a 38-year-old woman) announced on [26 Nov 2019]. His other home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far and have been put under medical surveillance.

Upon notification of the case, the CHP immediately commenced epidemiological investigations and conducted relevant contact tracing. Investigations are ongoing.

Doctors have urged people in Greater Manchester to make sure they and their children are vaccinated against measles after a sharp recent increase in cases. Public Health England said there had been 32 confirmed cases across Greater Manchester so far this year [2019]. At the end of January 2019, there had only been 5 confirmed cases. "The majority of the cases are in unvaccinated children," said Dr Kristina Poole, from Public Health England North West. In 2018, there were 144 cases in Greater Manchester, up from 127 in 2017.

Poole said uptake was "not good enough" and urged parents to ignore "social media fake news". Dr Poole said the MMR vaccine both protected individuals against the measles virus and also limited its spread throughout the community. "MMR is a highly effective and safe vaccine," she said.

The number of measles cases in Europe tripled between 2017 and 2018 to 82 596.

Many countries around the world are experiencing measles outbreaks, with the latest data indicating an overall 10 percent increase this year [2019]. As of 5 Nov 2019, there have been 440 263 confirmed cases reported by 187 Member States to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In the WHO's European region, the country of Ukraine has reported the most measles cases during 2019, with 56 802. This data compares with about 54,000 measles cases in all of 2018, which was more measles cases than all of the European Union combined. This negative news can be related to Ukraine's 42 million residents being counted in the WHO's leading countries with the highest number of unvaccinated children.

Unfortunately, Ukraine is geographically positioned to be a conduit for the continued spreading of the measles virus. Ukraine is bordered by Russia to the northeast; Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and Romania, Moldova, and the Black Sea to the south. Moreover, the recent measles outbreak in Brooklyn New York may be related to thousands of Breslov Hasidic Jews visiting the Ukrainian city of Uman in 2018, reported the New York Times.

In Ukraine, many parents are questioning their children's vaccinations. In Ukraine, infants can be vaccinated for measles at age 6 months. Their doubts are rooted in an inconsistent healthcare system and mistrust of authority.

Dr. Fedir Lapiy, a pediatric immunologist from Kiev, told Euronews in April 2019, 'that fears and mistrust in doctors meant parents in Ukraine were finding ways to avoid routine immunizations. We all know that there are a huge number of fake-vaccinated children," he said. "Every mum at the playground knows it. They say all the mothers do it; they just go and bribe the doctor or a nurse."

This vaccine mistrust is not limited to Ukraine. The WHO identified "vaccine hesitancy" as a top 10 threat to global health. Vaccine hesitancy -- the reluctance or refusal to vaccinate despite the availability of vaccines -- threatens to reverse progress made in tackling vaccine-preventable diseases, says the WHO.

Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease; it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved. An estimated 19.9 million infants worldwide were not reached with routine immunization services during 2017, says the WHO.

The reasons why people choose not to vaccinate are complex. A vaccine advisory group to WHO identified complacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines, and lack of confidence as key reasons underlying hesitancy.

Health workers, especially those in communities, remain the most trusted advisors and influencers of vaccination decisions, and they must be supported to provide trusted, credible information on vaccines.

The good news is that 167 countries have now included a 2nd dose of measles vaccine as part of their routine vaccination schedule.
Nevertheless, coverage levels remain well short of the WHO recommended measles immunization coverage of at least 95% to prevent outbreaks.
