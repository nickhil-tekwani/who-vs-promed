ARENAVIRUS INFECTION, HUMAN - USA (CALIFORNIA): COMMENT

A) I am surprised that ProMED-mail would publicize such a disease without a
confirmatory diagnosis since, as ProMED-mail points out, there is little to
worry about in terms of spread;
B) I am disappointed that the writer of the e-mail did not think to first
contact the local or the state public health department for information,
rather than the CDC. Local and state public health departments do the
overwhelming majority of infectious disease surveillance and response in
this country: in fact the CDC cannot become involved without an invitation
from the state's department of public health. These departments should be
the first resource that one turns to for disease information.

[I will never understand why "the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth" is so offensive to some. We did not post a message saying that
an arenavirus infection had been diagnosed in California. We said that
there was a rumor that that was the case and that we had not been able to
obtain official confirmation. If there is not a shred of evidence that
such a case, or cases, have occurred, why not send a denial of such a
rumor? What we did post was a message saying that person X had heard from
person Y ... etc. Even the comment above does not deny the rumor. My
suspicion is that we will soon hear that the case has been confirmed, and
then the local authorities will be in the uncomfortable position of having
to explain why they denied a reality. The truth would not panic anyone who
was properly educated.
As for the reasonable comment that one should turn to the local health
department for news about local infectious diseases, we now do so. Will
the people at the health department responsible for the Coachella Valley
let us know whether there is a suspected arenavirus infection there, the
age(s) of the patient(s), the medical status of the patient(s), and the
status of the laboratory test results?
I must add that I have a personal interest in all this. Our longitudinal
studies of hantaviruses in southeastern Colorado have provided us (Colorado
State University and the Centers for Disease Control) with sequential
samples from wood rats, the rodent host of Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWAV),
an arenavirus of unknown human pathogenicity. We have a great deal of data
and are preparing a manuscript describing these studies. It would be
useful (scientifically and for future funding) to know whether WWAV, or a
close relative of it, is a human pathogen. We have other data I am not
going to go into here. All the people I contacted for additional
information denied knowing anything or said they were not in a position to
provide me or ProMED-mail with information; these are responsible,
professional, and morally-correct investigators. They recognize that it is
the local health authorities who must make such disclosures, if there is
anything to disclose. So, local health departments, is there anything to
disclose? - Mod.CHC
