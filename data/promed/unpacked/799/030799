Revised Prediction of the Extent of the variant CJD Epidemic in the UK
------------------------------------------------
Researchers estimating how extensive the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
[abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail] epidemic might be in
Great Britain predict there will be 7000 future cases -- far fewer than the
half a million estimated in 1998.
Dr Azra Ghani, from Imperial College, London, who led the research, said
the age distribution of cases so far suggested certain young people were
"more susceptible to infection and/or were exposed to a greater extent."
She added: "Those aged between 10 and 20 years of age are most susceptible
or exposed to infection, with those over 40 years being much less
susceptible or exposed." Her findings suggest the young people will always
have the greatest risk of developing vCJD, even though measures have been
introduced to reduce the chance of contracting the disease through infected
meat. (The research findings will be published in the Proceedings of the
Royal Society).
Dr Ghani said uncertainty over the extent of the epidemic had decreased
since the disease was first identified 6 years ago, though it was still not
possible to make an accurate prediction. She added: "However, short-term
projections show that it is unlikely that a dramatic increase in case
numbers will be observed in the next 2 to 5 years." Ongoing studies testing
tonsil and appendix tissue for the presence of vCJD prions will provide
information about the prevalence of infection, Dr Ghani said. But she
added: "Their interpretation will be limited by our relatively poor
understanding of the sensitivity and specificity of the tests throughout
disease incubation. The main priority therefore remains the development of
a diagnostic test that is able to detect infection early in the incubation
period and that can be applied to large population samples, both in the UK
and elsewhere."
