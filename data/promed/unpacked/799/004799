Cholera in Nigeria
------------------
WHO has received reports from the Federal Ministry of Health in Nigeria of
a total number of 1616 cases and 126 deaths [from cholera]. Kano State
reported 1316 cases and 76 deaths (case fatality rate, 5.8 percent) from 15
Oct to 23 Nov 2004, and Edo State reported 300 cases and 50 deaths (case
fatality rate 16.7 percent) from 16 Sep to 18 Nov 2004. In both states,
_Vibrio cholerae_ has been laboratory-confirmed.
In Kano State, 20 local government areas have been affected with the case
fatality rate highest among those less than 2 years of age and over 60
years of age. While there are widespread water shortages in metropolitan
local government areas, many of the water sources that do exist are not safe.
WHO has assisted the Federal Ministry of Health with surveillance
activities and supplies of anti-sera. Medecins sans Frontieres has also
been assisting control efforts in Edo State. Cases appear to be decreasing
in both states.

3 people have died and 132 treated and discharged following a cholera
outbreak in Mtito Andei. One patient died at Makindu District Hospital and
another at Mtito Andei health center while undergoing treatment. The 3rd
casualty, a child, died at home before she could be taken to hospital.
The concentration of people at Mtito Andei, on the busy Mombasa highway,
raised fears of the disease spreading to other parts of the country. It is
a major transit point in the region.
Mtito Andei district clinical officer Zakayo Ndeto said the hospital had
treated 118 patients since 21 Nov 2004. A 29-year-old said he had started
feeling stomach pains and suffering from diarrhea after eating
githeri (boiled maize)and sukuma wiki (kale) at his Mang'elete home. But
hospital workers said he would be discharged after responding well to
treatment.
Mr Ndeto said the neighbouring Taita-Taveta had been placed on high alert
following the outbreak. "We are carrying out health education through
public meetings to create awareness of the disease. At the same time, we
are tracing the relatives of those who might have been infected by the
contagious disease."
At Makindu Hospital, Dr Richard Onkware said 13 patients who had been
admitted, on Sun, 28 Nov 2004, were referred by a private clinic in Mtito
Andei Town. One patient died while 12 others were treated and
discharged. "The patients are suspected to have been infected by drinking
contaminated water from a stagnant pond in Mtito Andei Town," he said.
Initial reports indicate that most of those admitted had drunk contaminated
water either at Mtito Andei township restaurants or at a recent funeral. Dr
Onkware said the situation had been contained and that Makindu Hospital had
not reported any new cases since the 11 patients were discharged last week.
The Makueni medical chief, Dr Charles Nzioki, said the outbreak was caused
by contaminated water from Mtito Andei and Mang'elete rivers and boreholes
within the Mang'elete and Kibwezi areas caused by the recent short rains.
The Government issued a cholera alert in Voi Town and banned food hawking.
Coast Provincial Medical Officer of Health, Dr Anderson Kahindi, who issued
the alert, said at least 4 people had been admitted to and others treated
and discharged.

these cases, 7 are children from a kindergarten, 5 schoolboys, one worker
in an eating establishment, and 6 adults. All patients are in Bargyzinsk
regional hospital; their condition at present is reported as satisfactory.
It is felt that the source was a woman working in an eating establishment.
An epidemiological investigation is proceeding. In Jul 2004, 22 hospitals
in Buryatiya reported dysentery in hospitalized patients, 86 children and 8
adults.

(eastern part of Kazakhstan). 24 of them are in serious condition.
According to the ministry of emergency situations, there are 46 children
hospitalized, 11 of whom are in extremely serious condition. Physicians are
diagnosing all of them as having gastroenterocolitis.
It was determined that food poisoning was the result of eating sponge cake
prepared by a local food factory. According to preliminary data, the source
was eggs that were contaminated with salmonellae and were used for
preparing the pastry.

Cholera downs 31 in Negros; alert up
--------------------------------------
The Department of Health (DOH) has declared a cholera alert in Negros
Occidental and Bacolod City, which was also designated a cholera hotspot,
after confirming 31 cases of the disease in 2004.
DOH regional epidemiologist Jessie Glen Alonsabe, who led a team that
arrived to conduct a medical survey and trace the possible source of the
disease, said 27 of the 31 confirmed cases were registered in Bacolod and
mostly involved residents along the city's shoreline.
The confirmed cases are among the 84 suspected cholera cases recorded by
the Provincial Health Office (PHO) as of 27 Nov 2004. However, the number
could rise; Mayor Pedro Zayco of Kabankalan City, where the PHO officially
recorded 38 suspect cases, said the number had reached 54 by 1 Nov 2004.
Although Provincial Health Officer Luisa Efren said the cases recorded this
year were triple the number in 2003, they were not declaring the situation
an outbreak, which she explained entailed cases in a geographical
cluster. So far, 2004's cases have been scattered.
Alonsabe said the cholera that has shown up here is the milder Ogawa
strain, not the deadlier El Tor.

Cholera outbreak strains health services in Lampung
-----------------------------------------------------
The rain for some people is not always a boon, and the torrential rains
that have hammered Bandarlampung over the past week have also brought with
them new problems, specifically cholera.
The storm in a number of subdistricts in Sukarame, North and West
Telukbetung, and Panjang districts last Thu 25 Nov 2004, for instance,
swamped houses, and the water level remains at 50 to 80 centimeters in some
places. It was the 2nd flood in 2 weeks to submerge the area, and one
result has been an outbreak of cholera, which is often accompanied by
symptoms of extremely severe diarrhea.
"Most of the cholera sufferers are those from flooded areas, as the
sanitary conditions are quite poor," said Dr. Reliani, director of Abdoel
Moeloek General Hospital in Bandarlampung, capital of Lampung province.
Those affected by cholera included residents who have relied on tap water
from Way Rilau, the state-owned tap water company. "We've been forced to
wash our clothes and perform our daily ablutions in the river, because the
tap water has not been running for the past month," said the father of a
cholera victim, a resident of Mesuji, Tulangbawang regency.
According to Misdan, more than half of the area's residents used the water
from the swollen Way Mesuji and Way Tulangbawang rivers, even though both
have become murky and polluted by industrial and household waste.
Managing director of the Way Rilau tap water company, a Mr. Sudjaswadi,
said that they were not able to fulfill the needs of customers because the
company was facing a shortage of water. In addition to the damage to
catchment areas and rivers, which are the source of water for the company,
4 main pipes have broken, greatly exacerbating the problems, he added.
Data at the Abdoel Moeloek hospital showed that 4 children under the age of
5 had died from complications related to severe diarrhea, believed to be
cholera, over the past 2 weeks. 2 were from Bandarlampung city and the 2
others from Tulangbawang regency.
There have been more than 40 children treated for cholera since 19 Nov
2004, while around 3000 children were reportedly suffering from severe
diarrhea in a number of regencies and municipalities. Thousands in
Tulangbawang regency fell ill after consuming river water.
Besides patients with severe diarrhea, of which the specific disease was
not known, a number of hospitals in Bandarlampung have diagnosed cholera in
dozens of patients over the last week. The Urip Sumaharjo General Hospital
has been treating 50 children with cholera, 3 more were reported at the
Abdoel Moeloek hospital, and 2 more at the Advent Hospital.
The number of patients at government hospitals or clinics complaining of
severe diarrhea reached 1900 in Aug 2004, 1600 in Sep, 1500 in Oct and 1300
patients from 1 to 23 Nov 2004

Gastro outbreak in Cebu hits 239 in 6 days
---------------------------------------------
Capitol lawyers will look into the liability of the Moalboal Water District
management, with 23 new cases of gastroenteritis recorded Sun, 28 Nov 2004
by the Badian District Hospital. 2 men have died since the outbreak
started 23 Nov 2004.
As of Sun 28 Nov 2004, Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) Chief Dr.
Cristina Giango said there were already 239 reported cases. Moalboal's
elected officials are also contemplating taking over its management and
operations, as Gov. Gwendolyn Garcia is alarmed by complaints she received
from resort owners that tourists are pulling out of the diving hub. "We
may take over, with the governor's help," said Mayor Inocentes Cabaron,
adding that the water firm is even operating in a barangay in Badian that
is no longer part of its franchise and where residents are also suffering
from diarrhea.
The 25-bed Badian District Hospital remained packed with 46 patients as of
28 Nov 2004. Patients who came in were advised to bring their own folding
beds as well as a hammer and nail, so medical personnel could hang their
dextrose bottles from the hospital walls.
