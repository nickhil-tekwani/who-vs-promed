[Information found in their annual report (January to December 2012) submitted to the OIE, shows that Kyrgyzstan reported 5 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the region of Jalal-Abad (2 outbreaks) and in the region of Naryn (3 outbreaks). Serotype A was identified in Jalal-Abad and serotype O was identified in Naryn; see http://tinyurl.com/kwoxrhz (Note: go to Section 3 of the report named "Detailed quantitative information for OIE-listed diseases/infections present" to see detailed information on these outbreaks).

Also see Mod.AS's commentaries in ProMED archive numbers 20120701.1186640 and 20120622.1177927.

The Talas region borders with the Jalal-Abad, Naryn and Chuy regions and with Kazakhstan. A map of the administrative divisions of Kyrgyzstan is available at http://www.ephotopix.com/image/asia/kyrgyzstan_political_map.gif.

Although the serotype was not identified for this outbreak, given the history in that area, it might be one of the serotypes that were identified in 2012. Hopefully typing of the virus will be done for any virus isolated in future events. - Mod.CRD
