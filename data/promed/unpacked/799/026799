Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus Confirmed in Montana Fields
-----------------------------------------------------
Farmers in Montana and Canada are watching disease pressure in winter wheat, as reports of wheat streak mosaic virus have been confirmed. For the past 2 years, extended fall growth, as well as hail damage, have contributed to heavy pressure from the wheat curl mite which carries the virus.

"I expect disease pressure across the state for 2016, heavier where it occurred in 2015," says Mary Burrows, Montana State University. If the virus is suspected, she says to not apply herbicide, as that makes the mites go to the top of the plant, and [they] are then carried downwind to neighboring fields. "Don't apply additional nitrogen, [it] will make the mites and virus grow and spread faster."

Depending on severity of the disease, she recommends tillage or swathing to terminate damaged fields. Farmers should scout fields often at green up. Spring wheat is even more susceptible to the virus. "Don't plant spring wheat downwind from diseased areas, pay attention to your green bridge and clean up the field."

Wheat growers in Canada and North Dakota should also be on alert and scout their crops early, she adds.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) can infect wheat, maize (some cultivars), grasses, as well as oats and barley in experimental inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop failure in wheat. Symptoms usually appear in warmer weather and may include yellow blotches, streaks, and mottling on leaves as well as severe stunting, excessive tillering and possibly death of plants.

WSMV is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tosichella_ (taxonomic confusion with _A. tulipae_ has been addressed by molecular methods -- see link below). Larvae acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious for approximately a week. Field distribution of symptoms is closely related to the dispersal of the vector; for example, margins of fields are often affected first. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted and seed transmitted at a low level. Control of the mite vector is difficult but disease management may include controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum from the previous season via a 'green bridge'.

WSMV or _Maize dwarf mosaic virus_ (MDMV, genus _Potyvirus_) have also been reported as synergistic partners, in the Americas and Europe, to cause maize lethal necrosis (MLN) in co-infection with _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles).
