Viet Nam braces for fresh foot-and-mouth epidemic
-----------------------------------------------
Signs of a fresh outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] have
emerged in Viet Nam's Mekong Delta region, with more and more animals
being infected in the last 10 days.
The deadly disease, which erupted nationwide in 2005, has now
reappeared in Vinh Long, Hau Giang, and Bac Lieu provinces. Some
areas in the northern and central regions are also reported to face
high risk of an epidemic.
In Vinh Long, 261 pigs and cows have fallen victim, the provincial
animal health department reported.
In Hau Giang, 15 pigs had been infected in the last few days, taking
the toll since May 2006 to 100, authorities said.
Bac Lieu province's Ngan Dua town reported widespread infection among cattle.
Authorities in these areas are now tightening control over transport
and trade of cattle, disinfecting affected areas, and vaccinating
animals.
The Vietnamese government has provided the provinces with tens of
thousands of doses of FMD vaccine. It plans to import 2 million doses
worth VND 36 billion [USD 2.3 million] from France and the
Netherlands for the national reserve.
Last year, 17 363 cattle and 18 232 pigs were reported to be
infected. Of them, 247 cattle and 12 072 pigs died of the disease or
were culled.
FMD is a highly infectious viral disease infecting animals with
cloven hooves, such as cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and deer.

[According to Viet Nam National Veterinary Department's last
statement, dated 8 Jul 2006 (see 20060712.1922), "Dak Nong and Dak
Lak provinces in the central region and Hanoi and Hai Phong cities in
the north have been all but cleared of the epidemic; however, FMD
continues to plague several localities on a small scale, including
northern Lai Chau and central Quang Nam provinces." Earlier, Viet Nam
reported to the OIE the extensive spread of 2 types of the FMD virus,
O and Asia-1, throughout Viet Nam (see 20060530.1510). The situation
seems to have deteriorated since, adding, at least, Vinh Long, Hau
Giang, and Bac Lieu provinces to the list of infected provinces. For
an administrative map of Viet Nam, see

From the available data, it seems that the current FMDV strain(s)
is/are particularly pathogenic, even lethal, to porcines. Are pigs --
victims and also prolific disseminators of the FMD virus -- included
in the vaccination scheme? Are both virus strains included in the
vaccine? Information pertaining to these points will help. - Mod.AS]
