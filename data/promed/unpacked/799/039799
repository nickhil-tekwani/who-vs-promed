The Public Health Agency of Canada is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _Escherichia coli_ O157, commonly called _E. coli_. The outbreak involves 3 provinces and is linked to romaine lettuce. At this time, there are no product recalls associated with this outbreak. The outbreak investigation is ongoing, and this public health notice will be updated on a regular basis as the investigation evolves.

The risk to Canadians is low. However, Canadians are reminded to follow safe food handling practices for lettuce to avoid becoming ill. Most people with an _E. coli_ infection will become ill for a few days and then recover fully. Some _E. coli_ infections can be life threatening, though this is rare.

_E. coli_ are bacteria that live naturally in the intestines of cattle, poultry, and other animals. A common source of _E. coli_ illness is raw fruits and vegetables that have come in contact with feces from infected animals. Leafy greens, such as lettuce, can become contaminated in the field by soil, contaminated water, animals, or improperly composted manure. Lettuce can also be contaminated by bacteria during and after harvest from handling, storing, and transporting the produce. Contamination in lettuce is also possible at the grocery store, in the refrigerator, or from counters and cutting boards through cross-contamination with harmful bacteria from raw meat, poultry, or seafood. Most _E. coli_ strains are harmless to humans, but some varieties cause illness.

Investigation summary
---------------------
Currently, there are 21 cases of _E. coli_ O157 illness under investigation in 3 provinces: Quebec (3), New Brunswick (5), and Newfoundland and Labrador (13). Individuals became sick in November 2017. 10 individuals have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between the ages of 5 and 72 years of age. The majority of cases (71 percent) are female.

Many individuals who became sick reported eating romaine lettuce before their illnesses occurred. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is working with public health officials to determine the source of the romaine lettuce that ill individuals were exposed to.

Although anyone can get an _E. coli_ infection, pregnant women, those with weakened immune systems, young children, and older adults are most at risk for developing serious complications.

The following food safety tips for lettuce will help you reduce your risk of getting an _E. coli_ infection:
- wash your hands thoroughly with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds, before and after handling lettuce;
- discard outer leaves of fresh lettuce;
- wash your unpackaged lettuce under fresh, cool running water. There is no need to use anything other than water to wash lettuce. Washing it gently with water is as effective as using produce cleansers;
- keep rinsing your lettuce until all of the dirt has been washed away;
- don't soak lettuce in a sink full of water. It can become contaminated by bacteria in the sink;
- ready-to-eat lettuce products sold in sealed packages and labelled as washed, pre-washed or triple washed do not need to be washed again;
- use warm water and soap to thoroughly wash all utensils, countertops, and cutting boards before and after handling lettuce to avoid cross-contamination;
- store lettuce in the refrigerator for up to 7 days. Discard when leaves become wilted or brown.
- bagged, ready-to-eat, pre-washed lettuce products should also be refrigerated and used before the expiration date.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducts food safety investigations into the possible food source of an outbreak. The Government of Canada will continue to update Canadians as new information related to this investigation becomes available.

[As noted in the post, most serotypes of _E. coli_, when confined to their usual habitat in the gastrointestinal tract, are harmless and indeed have beneficial properties to their human "host" including detoxifying substances and preventing the overgrowth of more harmful bacteria. Some strains, however, "enteropaths", have evolved to produce toxins and can cause diarrheal illnesses including travelers' diarrhea. One of these groupings is the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) also called Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ (STEC). It is this group with the prototypic serotype O157:H7 discussed in this post. Most of the time, however, when water boiling notices are posted because of high levels of _E. coli_ in a water supply, it is not EHEC per se being testing for but rather the _E. coli_, sometimes referred to as "coliforms" are used to test for sewage contamination of water.

The classical vehicle for EHEC is undercooked ground beef but salad ingredients such as lettuce, tomato, bean sprouts, and spinach can serve as a transmitter from contamination of the produce at any point from while growing in the field to harvesting to the restaurant or home kitchen. These organisms are found in a variety of animals, primarily cattle. While the advise in the posting is important, several enteric pathogens including EHEC can actually internalize into the produce and replicate there so washing will not always be successful in removing the contamination. The following publication is a recent one investigating this phenomenon:

Wright KM, Crozier L, Marshall J, et al. Differences in internalization and growth of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 within the apoplast of edible plants, spinach and lettuce, compared with the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Microb Biotechnol. 2017; 10: 555-69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404196/

Abstract
--------
Internalization of food-borne bacteria into edible parts of fresh produce plants represents a serious health risk. Therefore, internalization of verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolate Sakai was assessed in 2 species associated with outbreaks, spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_) and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) and compared to the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Internalization occurred in the leaves and roots of spinach and lettuce throughout a 10 day time-course. The plant species, tissue type and inoculum dose all impacted the outcome. A combination of low inoculum dose (about 100 CFU [colony-forming unit]) together with light microscopy imaging highlighted marked differences in the fate of endophytic _E. coli_ O157:H7 Sakai. In the fresh produce species, bacterial growth was restricted but viable cells persisted over 20 days, whereas there was more than 400-fold (about 2.5 Log10 ) increase in growth in _N. benthamiana_. Colony formation occurred adjacent to epidermal cells and mesophyll cells or close to vascular bundles of _N. benthamiana_ and contained components of a biofilm matrix, including curli expression and elicitation, extracellular DNA, and a limited presence of cellulose. Together the data show that internalization is a relevant issue in crop production and that crop species and tissue need to be considered as food safety risk parameters.
