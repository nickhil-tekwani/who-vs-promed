Infectious Diseases of Ukraine -- e-book (free of charge)
---------------------------------------------------------
In recent years, we have periodically donated educational materials to organizations involved in humanitarian and medical assistance activities associated with earthquakes, flooding, and other disasters. Although Ukraine is not a "developing country" the nature and scope of its diseases are unfamiliar to professionals from other countries.

Infectious Diseases of Ukraine is one in a series of 430 e-books that follow the status of all diseases which might be encountered in specific countries. The latest edition of this volume was released in February 2022 and contains up-to-date information regarding 217 individual conditions. Specific text notes incorporate 118 graphs and 499 electronically-linked references; details of vaccine schedules and uptake; the current status of COVID-19 in Ukraine, etc.

Gideon Informatics will distribute this e-book free of charge through the following link:
