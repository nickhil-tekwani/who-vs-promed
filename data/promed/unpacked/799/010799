This is interesting. Does this mean that enough work on typing CWD has been
done for you to be reasonably confident that it is a different group from
BSE? I would be interested to know what typing work has been done, and a
brief description of the differences observed between CWD and BSE.
If the work is strongly suggestive that CWD is distinct from BSE then the
possible origins for BSE become even more limited.
I wonder if anyone has any suggestions for an origin?

As with the other spongiform encephalopathies of ruminants (scrapie and
bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE]), the exact origin of chronic wasting
disease (CWD) of cervids (mule deer, _Odocoileus hemionus_; white-tailed
deer, _O. virginianus_; elk, _Cervus elaphus nelsoni_) is not known and may
never be determined. Though there are features of CWD which are similar to
the other spongiform encephalopathies of ruminants, including some of the
clinical signs and attributes of the histopathology, there are significant
differences.
We feel confident that CWD is not BSE for several reasons. First, consider
the epidemiology of BSE and its association with consumption of ruminant
derived protein contaminated with a TSE agent. CWD is not associated with
feeding ruminant protein. There is no evidence that BSE occurs in the United
States; it is difficult to imagine how deer and elk in Colorado and Wyoming
could have been exposed to BSE which occurs in the UK and a few other
countries. Evidence that cervids are not susceptible to BSE by a natural
route of exposure is based on lack of detection of a spongiform
encephalopathy in captive and zoo cervids in the UK, many of which could
have been exposed via feed to the BSE agent. Surveillance there seems
adequate considering BSE was detected in a number of antelope and other
nondomestic zoo species in the UK. Secondly, evidence from transmission
experiments indicate CWD is not BSE. Only a very low percentage of mice
develop spongiform encephalopathy when injected intracerebrally with CWD.
This is in contrast to the ease with which BSE (directly from cattle or
following passage in other species) is transmitted to mice by intracerebral
inoculation. In addition, strain typing studies by Drs. Bruce and Fraser,
Neuropathogenesis Unit, Edinburgh, using genetically characterized mice,
have shown that CWD is not BSE based on differences in incubation periods
and lesion profiles (unpublished data).

The evidence concerning the relationship of scrapie and CWD is less
definitive. Most (but not all) strains of scrapie are readily transmitted to
mice and hamsters by intracerebral inoculation. As mentioned above, CWD is
poorly transmitted to mice and we have been unable to transmit it to
hamsters. Domestic goats are quite susceptible to experimental scrapie;
incubation period of CWD in an intracerebrally inoculated goat was 6 years.
This would be an unusually long incubation period for scrapie in goats.
Finally, the strain typing studies of Drs. Bruce and Fraser have
demonstrated that CWD is unlike any strain of scrapie they have examined
(unpublished data).
Additional studies are planned or are currently underway to investigate the
relationship of CWD and the other TSEs of animals.
