MYCOBACTERIAL KERATITIS / M. CHELONIAE (6)
==========================================
A previous posting noted:

In my previous position, we had 3 cases of M. chelonei/M. fortuitum from
the eye (I don't have the records now which species was isolated in which
case). One was of an eye implant, one was a keratitis which was
post-traumatic and the third another keratitis ?source (patient seen at
emergency dept, went home and was untraceable). The first two cases were
clinically significant.
I also had experience culturing a specimen sent by research lab doing
tissue culture of amniotic membranes. M. chelonei was repeatedly isolated
from the culture fluid, and I have no doubt that the water source was
contaminated.
