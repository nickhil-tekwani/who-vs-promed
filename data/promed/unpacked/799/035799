Vets warn of deadly cat disease
-----------------------------------
The appearance of a deadly feline disease in Northeast Mississippi
has experts warning cat owners to take extra precautions, but some
vets say the risks are slim.
A fatal parasitic blood infection called cytauxzoonosis (pronounced
sy-toe-zo-ono-sis) was discovered in a cat recently at the
Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicines Animal
Health Center. There also have been a few cases of unexplained cat
deaths in Mississippi.
"The key to protecting your cat is prevention because there is no
cure for this disease," said Dr. Sharon Grace, clinical professor and
feline specialist.
People who have both dogs and cats should make sure all their animals
are tick free because the tick that carries the disease the American
dog tick can hitchhike from dogs or humans to cats, Grace said.
Pet owners should apply a topical product containing fipronil, which
will kill ticks that carry the disease.
"If you see a tick on your pet get rid of it right away," said
Gretchen Ganas, veterinarian at Tupelo's Animal Care Center. But, she
said, the disease is extremely rare and "it's unlikely to see any
problems, so there is no need to be overly concerned."
Neither Ganas nor veterinarian Stephen King of the Tupelo Small
Animal Hospital has seen cases of cytauxzoonosis. But King said that
doesn't mean it hasn't occurred.
"It's difficult to diagnose," King said.
Plus, said Dr. Mark Russak, a veterinarian at the Animal Health
Center, cats typically hide their symptoms, which emerge within
several days to 2 weeks of being bitten by a carrier tick. Symptoms
include listlessness, refusal to eat and drink, and extreme fever.
"The animal suffers an agonizing death within a short time from the
start of the infection, Grace said.
Despite the illness' rarity, Ganas said she's noticed an increase in
the flea and tick population this summer, and that could explain its
appearance.

["Cytauxzoonosis is caused by the protozoan parasite _Cytauxzoon
felis_, a single-celled organism transmitted to domestic cats through
the bite of an infected tick. Ticks feed on infected bobcats, the
natural hosts of this parasite, and ingest the organisms which
multiply within the tick. The organism is then spread to domestic
cats when they are bitten by an infected tick. Once inside the
domestic cat, cytauxzoon organisms multiply in the tissues. These
infected cells occlude vessels of the liver, spleen, lungs, and lymph
nodes. Eventually these infected cells rupture and release the
organisms into the blood stream where they infect the red blood
cells." (Borrowed from the Cat Clinic of Stillwater webpage on
cytauxzoonosis, availabale at:
<http://www.catclinicofstillwater.com/Cytauxzoonosis.htm>).
The clinical signs of the disease include depression, lethargy,
anorexia, fever ranging frequently from 104-106 deg F. Typically the
onset is rapid, with signs developing with in 5-7 days from exposure.
The cat's temperature declines to subnormal levels approximately 24
hours prior to death. Death is often within about a week of the
initial clinical signs.
Consequently it may be difficult to diagnose as there are many
diseases with the same non-specific signs.
Treatment is non-specific and the best treatment is prevention. Ticks
should be removed when found. There are a number of good
preventatives that are available from the veterinarian. - Mod.TG]
