Health authorities said Monday they are investigating an Internal Revenue
Service building where one worker died and two others became ill with
symptoms similar to Legionnaires' disease.
Geraldine Webster, a 59-year-old revenue officer, died earlier this month
after suffering high fever and aches similar to Legionnaires' disease. IRS
spokesman Steve Yost did not know the official cause of her death. Two
other employees reported similar illnesses last week.
Water samples were taken at the building, and employees were asked to
notify supervisors if they experience any flu-like symptoms. The building
houses
600 workers and was open Monday. The Harris County Health Department and
the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration were investigating.
The respiratory disease is caused by bacteria that thrive in cool, standing
water such as water towers or air conditioning ducts. It was identified in
1976 after an outbreak at an American Legion convention in Philadelphia
killed 34 people.
