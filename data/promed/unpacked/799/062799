A quarantine on the cattle export has been declared in connection with the
spreading of the foot-and-mouth disease cases among the cattle in
Tedotsminda and Akhaldaba villages, Gori district (Eastern Georgia). During
the last weeks 70 animals (cows) have died because of the disease in this
villages. There is a serious danger of foot-and-mouth disease spreading for
another six villages in Gori and Karelsky districts.
[It should be kept in mind that eastern Georgia is proximate to Armenia,
the Central Asian Republics and Turkey. Its western end abuts Southern
Russia. It is not a large country from east to west, and less from north to
south.
