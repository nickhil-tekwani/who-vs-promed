"According to the most optimistic scenario, no additional deformed lambs, caused by the Schmallenberg virus [SBV], are to be expected after 1 Feb 2012," says veterinarian Piet Vellema of the Animal Health Service [GD]. "This can be said, since we assume that the majority of infections took place during August and September last year [2011]," he added. Sheep infected by the SBV between their 25th and 50th day of gestation are most likely to give birth to deformed lambs. [The average normal gestation period of ewes is approximately 147 days, ranging from 144 to 152 days].

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was detected on 19 Jan 2012 by RT-PCR in the brain of a 6 month old Belgian Blue male aborted foetus calf. The aborted foetus did not present malformation but subcutaneous oedema and hydranencephaly at necropsy. The herd is located in the south of Belgium, near the French border, and has about 300 cattle, mostly of the Belgian Blue beef type and several dairy cows. Brucellosis, BVD, mycosis, and current bacteria have been excluded. Testing for BTV, Q fever, and _Neospora caninum_ are ongoing.

Although at this stage SBV cannot be claimed as responsible for the abortion, these findings go in line with the assumptions made by the Dutch colleagues that it is more difficult to prove the presence of SBV in calves than it is in lambs because of the longer time between infection and parturition in cattle, allowing the foetus to clear the virus before birth. Here, as the abortion occurred 3 months before calving, it is reasonable to think that the virus was not eliminated yet. A similar situation has been described for Akabane virus in sheep and cattle. This also confirms that a peak of disease could be expected for the next 2 or 3 months in cattle and calls in question the previous diagnoses in numerous farms with abortion or deformed calves.

So far, 50 farms with abortions, stillbirths and congenital malformations have been observed in ruminants in Belgium. These included 18 cattle farms (only one tested positive), 30 sheep farms (of which 27 tested positive) and 2 negative goat farms.
