More than 300 people have died from an encephalitis outbreak since
July [2007]. Despite all efforts to control the disease, the number
of people who have been affected has increased, health officials said
on Tuesday [23 Oct 2007].

Top medical official of Uttar Pradesh in the northern state of Anant
Kumar Singh said that there were more than 10 million children who
were vaccinated against the killer virus.

"In total, 42 districts are prone to the virus, but due to a shortage
of vaccine, only 18 have been fully covered," Singh said.

India is one of the most populous countries in the world with 180
million residents and also one of the world's poorest countries. The
encephalitis disease claimed more than 400 lives in 2006 and 1400 in
2005. Some of the effects of the virus include brain damage.

Encephalitis or brain fever virus is often passed from pigs [or
birds] to human beings [transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes . -
Mod.TY]. It is endemic to the eastern part of the state.

[This situation illustrates the dilemma faced by developing countries
when the need -- in this case for vaccines to accomplish adequate
population coverage -- exceeds the resources available to provide it.
