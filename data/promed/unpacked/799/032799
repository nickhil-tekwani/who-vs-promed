[Checking the 100 reports mentioning cholera that we have posted so far
during 1998 against today's Notifications from WHO, I see that we have
missed outbreaks in the following countries. I note that these cases
occurred as far back as May (Zimbabwe) but are only now being officially
notified to WHO, none of them less than 3 weeks late - Mod.JW]
