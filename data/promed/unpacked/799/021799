[As a reminder, in the last post (Poliomyelitis update (66): Pakistan (KP) 20190807.6610623) there were an additional 5 newly confirmed cases of WPV-associated paralytic disease reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, that will most likely be included in next week's update. The widespread isolation of WPV in all 4 major provinces of Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan) is further confirmation of the widespread circulation of the WPV in Pakistan.

As for the cVDPV outbreaks, transmission is continuing in the DR Congo, and most likely still circulating in Nigeria and Somalia. The disturbing information is that there have been 10 separate introductions of cVDPV in the DR Congo. A challenging year.

As done in previous posts, to visualize all of this activity, I am putting links to HealthMap/ProMED-mail maps of countries with poliovirus activity during the past 12 months below. The size of the list remains impressive.
