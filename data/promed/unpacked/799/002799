The Netherlands suspended exports of live ruminants late yesterday
after a sheep farm in the south of the country was infected by
so-called bluetongue virus, the Dutch agriculture ministry announced.
"A farm in Kerkrade has been hit by catarrhal fever," the ministry
said in a statement.
It was the 1st time bluetongue disease, found in Greece and Italy
[see commentary], had been reported in northern Europe, the ministry added.
The authorities immediately halted exports of live ruminants --
cattle, sheep and goats -- and embryos, sperm and cells from those
animals. The freeze on exports might last for several weeks, the ministry said.
In an effort to contain the outbreak, ruminants as well as pigs and
horses must be kept indoors within a 20-km (13-mile) radius of the
infected farm and may not be transported. Use of insecticides is
obligatory in these places. [It is not clear why pigs and horses,
refractile to BT, are included in the restrictions. - Mod.AS]
A security zone was set up with a radius of 100 km (65 miles) around
the farm, with no animal or living animal matter allowed in or out.
A further 50-km zone outside the security zone has been placed under
surveillance.
Bluetongue is a non-contagious, insect-transmitted, viral disease of
sheep, which is not known to affect humans, according to the European
Union food safety website.
The disease is characterised by inflammation of the mucous membranes,
congestion, swelling and haemorrhages. Sheep are generally the worst
affected, while cattle and goats do not usually show any clinical
signs of disease but can carry the virus for a certain period of time
and transmit it to sheep.
It is treated by restricting the movement of infected animals and
through the use of vaccine.

Suspected material from sheep with typical symptoms have been
investigated by the CIDC laboratory in Lelystad. The presence of a BT
virus was demonstrated by RT-PCR and the detection of antibodies by a
specific BT-specific ELISA.
To confirm this first case of BT in the Netherlands, samples were
sent to the European reference laboratory at Pirbright, UK. On 17 Aug
2006, the findings of CIDC were confirmed by the reference
laboratory. A formal final confirmation will be possible when virus
isolation is completed.

The European Commission has been informed of a confirmed outbreak of
bluetongue in sheep in the southern part of the Netherlands. Further
investigations and laboratory testing are currently being performed
at the Community Reference Laboratory in Pirbright (UK), to identify
the strain involved.
Bluetongue is an insect-borne viral disease which affects domestic
and wild ruminants. It does not affect humans and there is no risk of
the disease being contracted or spread through meat or milk.
Bluetongue is frequently reported in southern Europe, particularly in
parts of Italy and Spain, but this case in the Netherlands is the 1st
ever to be detected in Northern Europe. The Dutch authorities have
stopped all trade of live ruminants and their semen, embryos and ova,
and put a standstill on the movement of ruminants and their live
products within a 20km zone around the outbreak. An Italian expert is
assisting the Dutch authorities in addressing the situation. A
coordination meeting between the Commission, the Netherlands and the
bordering Member States was held this morning and special meeting of
the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health will
discuss the situation on Monday. A Commission decision will then be
adopted on the Community measures to be taken, including a ban on
the dispatch and export of live ruminants and their semen, embryos
and ova from the affected area, which will include neighbouring
countries. Protection zones (100km radius) and surveillance zones
(50km radius) around the infected farm should also be established, in
line with Directive 2000/75/EC laying down specific provisions for
the control and eradication of bluetongue.

[Following the above laboratory data, the Netherlands' Ministry of
Agriculture, Nature and Food Safety published an updated press
release confirming the outbreak and took the necessary, prescribed
measures related to the local situation and to export.
The European Commission has been informed of a confirmed outbreak of
bluetongue in sheep in the southern part of the Netherlands. --- A
coordination meeting between the Commission, the Netherlands and the
bordering Member States was held this morning and special meeting of
the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health will
discuss the situation on Monday [21 Aug 2006]. A Commission decision
will then be adopted on the Community measures to be taken.
Typically, bluetongue is a seasonal disease; in the Mediterranean
basin, the season generally extends from July to December, depending
upon the vector activity. This season might end earlier in cooler
northern Europe, probably in November or earlier.
Kerkrade is situated in the southern Dutch province of Limburg,
adjacent to the German and Belgian borders; map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.8649&lon=6.0631&scale=200000&icon=x>.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.8649&lon=6.0631&scale=200000&icon=x>.
According to the daily Volkskrant of 18 Aug 2006, there are 12
additional Dutch farms where the disease is currently suspected. See
<http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article340416.ece/Blauwtong_mogelijk_bij_dertien_bedrijven>.
Since 1998, the Bluetongue virus (BTV) has spread from the Near East
and North Africa into and within Mediterranean Europe. It has, so
far, been recorded in mainland Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Bosnia,
Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia Republic, Republic of Serbia,
Montenegro, Italy (Calabria, Sicily and Sardinia), France (Corsica),
Spain and Portugal.
The said epizootics seem to have been introduced from 2 different
origins: BTV-2 from the south while BTV-1, BTV-4, BTV-9 and BTV-16
from the east. For details and maps, see: Gomez-Tejedor, 2004. Brief
overview of the BT situation in Mediterranean Europe, 1998-2004. Vet.
Ital., 40 (3), 57-60. Available online at
<http://www.te.izs.it/vet_italiana/2004/03/14.pdf>.
Stamping-out of affected or exposed sheep might fail to stop the
circulation of the virus, since subclinically -- or rather
non-clinically -- infected bovines are the main virus source for
vector infection. Information on the serotype recorded in Limburg is
required for decisions regarding sheep vaccination, which should be
considered as the measure of choice. Italy, Spain and Portugal have
been successfully carrying out mass vaccinations applying
live-attenuated vaccines including the relevant serotypes.
Entomological investigations might help in clarifying the route of
introduction and to enable assessment of further possible spread,
within and beyond the Netherlands territory. Enhanced surveillance in
other European countries is needed to explain the rather puzzling
appearance of BT in Limburg, not preceded by outbreaks in more
southern regions. - Mod.AS]
