Health authorities announced today, 18 Aug 2014, they were investigating a case of _Vibrio vulnificus_ necrotizing fasciitis in a 71-year-old man. The patient, with good past health, lives in Guangdong. He has developed left leg pain and swelling beginning on 9 Aug 2014 and was admitted to Yan Chai Hospital [Hong Kong] on 12 Aug 2014 for management. He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit the following day for further treatment and returned to the general ward today [18 Aug 2014] in stable condition.

The clinical diagnosis was left leg necrotizing fasciitis. His left leg wound swab yielded _Vibrio vulnificus_ upon preliminary laboratory testing by Princess Margaret Hospital [Hong Kong].

Investigations by the CHP [Centre for Health Protection] are proceeding.

"Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious bacterial infection of the soft tissue and fascia. It can destroy tissue and cause death within 12 to 24 hours after infection," a spokesman for the CHP explained.

[There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
