Gaston College is investigating how several students recently contracted staph infection. On [30 Nov 2015], the college learned of a single case of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_, or MRSA, involving a student in its cosmetology program at its Lincoln Campus, according to a news release from the college. The student was not allowed to return to the program until cleared by their physician.

The college learned of a 2nd case on [1 Dec 2015], also involving a student in the cosmetology program. That student was immediately sent home until cleared by their physician. Everyone associated with the cosmetology program was temporarily relocated as a college sanitation team worked to disinfect the area.

The response is normal protocol for such a situation, and it usually prevents any additional cases. On Wednesday [9 Dec 2015?], 2 additional cases were reported, and the college had a specialized company perform a more extensive disinfecting of the area.

MRSA is a common germ that about one in 3 people have on their skin or in their nose, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The organization said it does not cause any problems for most people who have it on their skin, but sometimes it can cause skin and other infections. It is spread by having direct contact with another person's infection or by touching surfaces or items that have been contaminated. Those who were infected will be OK, Gaston College spokeswoman Stephanie Michael-Pickett said. She said it may have started when a student got a tattoo somewhere off campus.

Michael-Pickett said special scheduling has been made for those in the cosmetology program and all have been informed that they should contact their personal physician should they have any symptoms associated with MRSA. She said additional efforts are underway to contact others who may have visited the cosmetology department during this period.

[Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) is a type of _S. aureus_ that is resistant to antibiotics called beta-lactams, which include methicillin, oxacillin, and other more common antibiotics such as penicillin, amoxicillin, and cephalexin. MRSA have been causing infections acquired in a healthcare facility, such as a hospital, long-term care facility (such as a nursing home), or hemodialysis unit for more than 40 years. The appearance of MRSA infections acquired outside healthcare settings is a more recent problem. Clusters of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections have been documented among children in daycare centers, athletes participating in contact sports, military recruits, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan Natives, Native Americans, men who have sex with men, IV drug users, and prisoners, who had no link to health care systems.

Factors that have been associated with the spread of CA-MRSA skin infections in otherwise healthy people include close skin-to-skin contact, skin cuts or abrasions, contact with contaminated surfaces (such as, gym equipment, shared towels), and poor hygiene.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies MRSA isolates based on the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns (currently USA100-1200) (McDougal L, et al: Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing of oxacillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ isolates from the United States: Establishing a national database. J Clin Microbiol. 2003; 41(11): 5113-20, available at http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/41/11/5113?view=long&pmid=14605147).

The PFGE type of CA-MRSA is not specified in the report above. USA300, the predominant epidemic clone in numerous outbreaks in the United States, is also increasingly seen in Canada and Europe.

USA300 usually carries the genes encoding Panton-Valentine leukocidin (an exotoxin that induces lysis of host phagocytic blood cells, thus impairing host response), and has caused outbreaks of skin and soft issue infection, as well as invasive disease (such as, bacteremia, endocarditis, necrotizing pneumonia, and osteomyelitis) (Tenover FC, Goering RV: Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ strain USA300: origin and epidemiology. J Antimicrob Chemother 2009; 64(3): 441-6, available at http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/3/441.full). USA300 is characterized also by having the arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), MLST ST8, spa-sequence type t008, the _msr_(A) erythromycin resistance gene, and staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC) _mec_ type IVa, whereas health care-acquired (HA)-MRSA carry SCC_mec_ Types I, II, and III. The mecA gene encodes methicillin resistance. The SCC found in HA-MRSA carry, in addition to the mecA gene, genes that encode resistance to multiple non-beta-lactam classes of antimicrobials.

CA-MRSA strains have been generally susceptible to a wider range of antibiotics, other than beta-lactams (such as fluoroquinolones and clindamycin). However, USA300 isolates are becoming more resistant to antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, mupirocin, and tetracycline, and have spread to Europe, Japan, South America, and Australia.

We are told in the news report above only that being a student in the cosmetology program at Gaston College links the 4 people with MRSA infection. Sharing beauty products and makeup brushes are known risks for transmission of CA-MRSA. Sporadic cases of CA-MRSA infection related to sharing cosmetic equipment (https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/the-hidden-dangers-of-makeup-brushes-115687638893.html) and an outbreak of the USA300 strain related to a beauty salon in the Netherlands, in a beautician, a family member, a household contact, and customers and their partners have been reported (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2630724/).

Molecular typing of the strains of MRSA causing infection in the 4 cosmetology students and any strains isolated from the environment would help delineate transmission pathways. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

Gaston College, is a comprehensive community college located in North Carolina; the school of cosmetology, located on the Lincoln campus in Lincolnton, NC, became operational in January 2012 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_College). - Mod.ML
