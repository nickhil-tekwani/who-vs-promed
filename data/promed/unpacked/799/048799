Two people from the same family died from botulism after eating canned
eggplant [also called aubergine or brinjal. - Mod.SH] in Rio Preto. The
initial symptoms occurred in a 56 year old man who died on 27 Sep 2009.
About a week later, his son of 33 fell ill during a trip to Piracicaba,
where he died on 5 Oct 2009. For 30 years, there had been no reports of
botulism in the city.

The results were released on Thursday [5 Nov 2009] by the Institute Adolfo
Lutz. Besides the 2 deaths, 2 other people developed the disease. According
to the Ministry of Health of Black River, one case was confirmed in the
laboratory and 3 by clinical and epidemiological criteria.

According to the coordinator of Epidemiological Surveillance of Black
River, Luciano Lourencao, all consumed [home] pickled eggplant during a
family reunion.

[Symptoms of foodborne botulism usually develop 18 to 36 hours after
ingestion of the food containing the toxin, although cases have varied from
4 hours to 8 days. Early signs of intoxication consist of marked lassitude,
weakness, and vertigo, usually followed by double vision and progressive
difficulty in speaking and swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of
other muscles, abdominal distention, and constipation may also be common
symptoms.

The types of foods involved in botulism vary according to food preservation
and eating habits in different regions. Any food that is conducive to
outgrowth and toxin production which, when processed, allows spore survival
and is not subsequently heated before consumption can be associated with
botulism. Almost any type of food that is not very acidic (pH above 4.6)
can support growth and toxin production by _Clostridium botulinum_.
Botulinal toxin has been demonstrated in a considerable variety of foods,
such as canned corn, peppers, green beans, soups, beets, asparagus,
mushrooms, ripe olives, spinach, tuna fish, chicken and chicken livers and
liver pate, luncheon meats, ham, sausage, stuffed eggplant, lobster, and
smoked and salted fish.

The incidence of the disease is low, but the mortality rate is high if not
treated immediately and properly. Some cases of botulism may go undiagnosed
because symptoms are transient or mild, or misdiagnosed as Guillain-Barre
syndrome.

Botulinum toxin causes flaccid paralysis by blocking motor nerve terminals
at the myoneural [nerve-muscle] junction. The flaccid paralysis progresses
symmetrically downward, usually starting with the eyes and face, to the
throat, chest, and extremities. When the diaphragm and chest muscles become
fully involved, respiration is inhibited and death from asphyxia results.
Recommended treatment for foodborne botulism includes early administration
of botulinal antitoxin and intensive supportive care (including mechanical
breathing assistance).

All people are believed to be susceptible to the foodborne intoxication.

Although botulism can be diagnosed by clinical symptoms alone,
differentiation from other diseases may be difficult. The most direct and
effective way to confirm the clinical diagnosis of botulism is to
demonstrate the presence of toxin in the serum or feces of the patient or
in the food which the patient consumed. Determination of the source of an
outbreak is based on detection and identification of toxin in the food
involved. The most widely accepted method is the injection of extracts of
the food into passively immunized mice (mouse neutralization test). The
test takes 48 hours. This analysis is followed by culturing all suspect
food in an enrichment medium for the detection and isolation of the
causative organism. This test takes 7 days. - Mod.LL
