35 infected with anthrax from beef in Pabna
-------------------------------------------
At least 35 people in Pabna [Rajshahi Division] have been infected
with anthrax after consuming beef infected with the bacterium, the
district health department said on Sunday [30 Aug 2009].

Pabna district health department said an anthrax infected cow in
Sathia upazila [subdistrict] was slaughtered and sold on [26 Aug 2009]
in Soto Pathailhat village, leaving at least 35 locals infected with
the bacterium after they consumed the contaminated meat.

Doctors confirmed the cases of anthrax infection when a number of the
victims went to Sathia upazila health complex seeking medical
assistance.

Anthrax commonly infects both wild and domesticated mammals, which
ingest or inhale the bacterium while grazing. Diseased animals can
then spread anthrax to humans, either by direct contact or through
consumption of the meat.

A 4-member committee has been formed to investigate the incident,
headed by Dr Ranjit Kumar, a specialist in epidemiology at the health
directorate.

Primary testing at the Sirajganj animal resource office's laboratory
has already confirmed the presence of anthrax in the beef, although
the committee had taken further samples for testing.

Pabna civil surgeon Dr AHM Md Khairul Alam Choudhury said there was no
reason to panic. "Hopefully those infected will recover in a few days,
although problems may arise as the disease is contagious," said
Choudhury. He said the victims should stay in hospital until they are
free of the contagion.
