Luteovirus and Polerovirus Found in Small Grains for the First Time in the
Matanuska-Susitna Region of Alaska.
NL Robertson, USDA, ARS, Arctic Plant Germplasm Introduction and Research
Project, Palmer, AK 99645. Plant Dis. 87:446, 2003; published on-line as
D-2003-0204- 02N, 2003. Accepted for publication 16 Jan 2003.
The Matanuska-Susitna Valley is one of the most fertile regions in Alaska
for growing cool-season vegetables. Barley (_Hordeum vulgare_) and oat
(_Avena sativa_) crops are also sown for animal feed and green manure.
The most damaging and widely distributed viral disease of small grains
worldwide is barley yellow dwarf (BYD), caused by several species from 2
genera in the family Luteoviridae: Luteovirus (Barley yellow dwarf virus
[BYDV-MAV and BYDV-PAV]), Polerovirus (Cereal yellow dwarf virus [CYDV-RPV,
formerly BYDV-RPV]) and 3 unassigned species (BYDV-RMV, BYDV-SGV, and
BYDV-GPV) (2,4). Even though barley and oat have been grown in Alaska for
more than 50 years, BYD has not been documented in small grains in this
region.
During September 2001, barley plants with bright yellow leaves were
collected from 5 barley fields near Palmer. 3 plants from each field were
assayed using RT-PCR to target members of the Luteoviridae (3). Results
suggested that a ca. 530-bp PCR product and its RFLP produced by digestion
with Nde11 were indicative of BYDV-PAV infection
In September 2002, 3 of the 5 sites were surveyed again for BYDV. 2 fields
(BF-1 and BF-2) had been replanted with barley and the other (OF-3) was
planted with oats. Leaf samples from 36 symptomatic barley plants from each
field and 60 symptomatic oat plants were randomly collected and stored at
-80 deg C. In addition to RT-PCR and RFLP analyses, testing for BYDV-PAV,
CYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV was performed by ELISA using Agdia kits (Agdia,
Elkhart, IN) (1).
RT-PCR and RFLP were completed on all samples using 0.5 g of tissue. Of
samples from BF-1, BF-2, and OF-3, 61, 100, and 70 percent, respectively,
generated Luteoviridae-specific fragments. The RFLP profiles from barley
were all PAV-like, whereas 71 percent of oat samples were PAV-like, and 29
percent were of an unknown pattern.
No bands were observed from apparently healthy field plants. ELISA (0.2 g
of tissue) was performed on all PCR-positive samples, resulting in 22, 97,
and 33 percent infection for BYDV-PAV from BF-1, BF-2, and OF-3,
respectively. An additional 29 percent of oat samples (OF-3) tested
positive for CYDV-RPV, whereas none of the barley plants tested positive.
One oat plant was infected with both PAV and RPV, and all oat plants with
the unidentified RFLP pattern were serologically positive for RPV.
No BYDV-SGV was detected in either barley or oats. PCR was clearly more
sensitive than ELISA, especially for plants that had mature and necrotic
tissue, which were predominately found in BF-1 and OF-3.
Based on these direct tests on the coat protein nucleic acid (PCR) and
serology (ELISA), it is concluded that 2 distinct viruses, BYDV-PAV and
CYDV-RPV, were found in oats, whereas only BYDV-PAV was found in barley.
To my knowledge, this is the first report of luteovirus and polerovirus
infection in small grains in Alaska.

[BYD is found worldwide and is considered to be the most damaging viral
pathogen of small-grain cereals. Its host range includes barley, oat,
triticale, and wheat. Luteoviruses infecting these cereal crops are
transmitted in a persistent manner by many aphid species. Disease management
utilizes resistant or tolerant cultivars, application of chemical
insecticides to reduce aphid populations, and early planting in to avoid the
aphid vectors. The wheat relative _Thinopyrum intermedium_ is a source of
tolerance to BYDV and has been introgressed into breadwheats. - Mod.DH]
