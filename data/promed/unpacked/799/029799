Anderson Moores Veterinary Specialists confirmed today [Wed 10 Mar 2021] that there have been another 3 positive cases of the deadly disease in the UK. This includes a case in Knaresborough.

A spokesperson said: "Unfortunately, we have to confirm a further 3 cases of Alabama Rot, also known as CRGV (cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy). The cases were from Preston (Lancashire), Knaresborough (N.Yorkshire) and Poole (Dorset). In total, the UK has now seen 271 confirmed cases with 20 cases in 2021. This disease is still rare, so we're advising dog owners to remain calm but vigilant, and seek advice from their local vet if their dog develops unexplained skin lesions."

There have been 8 cases of Alabama Rot in Yorkshire in recent years. It can only be confirmed if a post mortem is carried out on an animal after death. Cases have been confirmed in Huddersfield, Leeds, Otley, Keighley and Ripon, to name a few.

The condition is officially called CRGV, but it was named after the state in America where it was 1st found. It is a disease caused by damage to the blood vessels in the skin and kidney and causes tiny blood clots to form, which blocks them and can lead to damage of the affected tissue, ultimately leading to either skin lesions or kidney failure.

Without urgent treatment, dogs develop an intense fever which can sometimes kill them. No breed is immune to it, and the disease seems to thrive in wet conditions.

[A "frequently asked questions" document addressing Alabama rot in the UK by the Royal Veterinary College (University of London), last updated 6 Feb 2020, is available at https://www.rvc.ac.uk/small-animal-vet/news/alabama-rot-in-the-uk-frequently-asked-questions.

The clinico-pathological features of CRGV as observed in the UK since 2012 have been summarised, analysed, and presented in a (conveniently illustrated) Veterinary Record paper, published online 21 Jan 2021 (Ref 1).

The Abstract and Conclusion chapters follow.

"1. Abstract
- Background: 178 dogs with cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) were evaluated to further the understanding of the natural course of CRGV. CRGV, a form of thrombotic microangiopathy, can cause skin lesions and potentially acute kidney injury (AKI) with a high mortality rate.
- Methods: Cases were submitted from multiple practices from 2012 until June 2019. Clinical histories and laboratory data were reviewed to describe the features of CRGV.
- Results: Most cases (91%) occurred between November and May. 15 dogs (8.4%) with CRGV were in contact with another dog that developed skin lesions/AKI. Limb lesions were present on 144 dogs (80.9%) at presentation. Median time from appearance of a lesion to AKI was 3 days (range around 4-45 days). Neurological signs occurred in 33 dogs (18.6%) including at presentation in 2 (1.1%). Systemic signs were present in 13 dogs prior to a skin lesion (7.3%). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were prescribed prior to AKI identification in 92 of 170 dogs (54.1%). Thrombocytopenia was present in 115 of 137 (83.9%) of dogs.
- Conclusion: The timeframe over which AKI may develop is longer than previously reported, neurological signs can be identified at presentation or during hospitalisation, and thrombocytopenia is even more common than previously reported."

"2. Conclusion
CRGV remains a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) of unknown aetiology, which imparts a grave prognosis when clinically significant azotaemia develops. It is unclear why there has been a yearly variation in case numbers, and further epidemiological study is required. This updated report provides clarification on the expected features of the disease in the UK and helps guide clinicians as to when to suspect CRGV as a major differential. The report highlights that neurological signs may be a feature of the disease including at initial presentation, identifies a greater range in time from skin lesions to development of AKI, and identified that NSAID use is prevalent at initial presentation which may be concerning given the potential nephrotoxicity of these medications. It is likely that some cases of CRGV in the UK remain non-azotaemic, and it is possible that there are more surviving cases than the authors are aware of. Further research into the underlying aetiology of CRGV is required to help identify triggers, define prognostic indicators and to determine optimal management."
