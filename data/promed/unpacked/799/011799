Murray Valley Encephalitis and Kunjin Virus Disease Warning
-----------------------------------------------------------
Territory Health Services (THS) is issuing a warning to Territorians and
visitors to the whole of the Northern Territory (NT), as well as visitors
to northwest Western Australia, western Queensland and western New South
Wales (NSW), to take extra precautions over the next 2 months against being
bitten by mosquitoes. The latest information, together with past
experience, indicates that there is a current risk of Murray Valley
encephalitis (MVE) and Kunjin virus disease from the Top End of the NT to
Central Australia.
Although there have been no cases notified, the sentinel chicken program
has picked up MVE virus and Kunjin virus activity in the Tennant Creek
area. The risk area is also extended to south of Katherine, including the
Barkly and Victoria River District (VRD). A risk also applies to the
Central Australia region, with particularly high mosquito numbers centered
around Ilarpa Swamp on the southern outskirts of Alice Springs.
This warning particularly applies to people visiting and camping near
flooded areas and swamp and river systems during the evening and night in
the VRD and Barkly regions, as well as the Top End and Central Australia,
and in any area with relatively high mosquito activity.
MVE virus causes a potentially fatal illness. The normal symptoms of MVE
are severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, tremor, and in some cases the
disease progresses to delirium, and coma. Kunjin virus generally causes a
non-fatal disease with symptoms of fever and severe headache. Both viruses
are transmitted by the bite of the common banded mosquito (_Culex
annulirostris_), which occurs in highest numbers during and just after the
wet season. Not all of these mosquitoes will be carrying a virus, and only
one person in approximately 1000 who gets bitten by mosquitoes with the
virus will get the disease.
People who are most at risk of developing MVE are newcomers to the region
such as babies, young children, tourists or people from southern Australia.
THS advise that there is no vaccine for MVE or Kunjin virus disease and
that the only protection is to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. People do
not need to alter plans to visit the NT, however, it is important to be
aware of the risks of these viruses and to take appropriate precautions.
Other mosquito-borne viruses such as Ross River virus and Barmah Forest
virus are also likely to be present in the risk areas and are likely to be
carried by the same species of mosquitoes at the moment.
