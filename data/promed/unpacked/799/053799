FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - UK (02): FOLLOW-UP DIAGNOSTIC METHODS

The report of the development of a field rapid test by the Institute
for Animal Health, Pirbright raises a number of questions: (1) there
are still unanswered questions about the apparent failure of
Pirbright to use the correct (i.e. USDA/Tetracore) reagents in 2001;
(2) the matter of willingness or unwillingness to use the
technologies rather than the commercially developed technologies; (3)
the potential unfair role of an agency that both advises the
government on which devices to use while producing their own devices;
and (4) as a consequence, unfair competition for private companies.
Roger Breeze, Associate Administrator of the USDA Agricultural
Research Service in 2001, who offered the ARS/Tetracore device to the
UK at that time, has recently commented on the IAH efforts. See: FMD
& CSF Coordination Action website:

His publications include an invited paper for OIE which covers the
use of rapid field test devices: "Technology, public policy and
control of transboundary livestock diseases in our lifetimes," Rev.
sci. tech. Off. int. Epiz., 2006, 25 (1), 271-292, in "Biological
disasters of animal origin: The role and preparedness of veterinary
and public health services," edited by Martin Hugh-Jones; Scientific
and Technical Review, Volume 25 (1), April 2006. See:
