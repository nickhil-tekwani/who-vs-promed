Mexico is in the grip of one of the worst droughts in its history, with
cattle dying and farmers watering their crops with raw sewage. Authorities
have already declared 5 northern states disaster areas, and will add 7 more
states unless there is rain in the next day or so. Reservoirs and rivers
are drying up, crops are wilting and more than 10,000 cattle have died.
Meteorologists say this could be Mexico's worst drought. In Sonora state
rainfall is 92 per cent below average. In Nayarit state there has been no
rain this year. Even the Rio Grande, separating Mexico and the United
States, is almost dry along a long stretch of the border. It is the second
consecutive dry year across northern Mexico, and for some states the fifth
consecutive year of drought.

[Drought is a serious issue for the agriculture industry and from the
aspect of water availability for people and towns. This is also an economic
hardship for producers and even for the entire region. Texas and Oklahoma
suffered terribly last year from prolonged excessive high temperatures and
drought. Fortunately, the high temperatures of this time last year have not
arrived yet, but rain is in short supply. - Mod.TG
