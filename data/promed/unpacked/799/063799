The number of hantavirus cases linked to Yosemite National Park rose Thursday [30 Aug 2012] as authorities said 3 more cases of the rare, rodent-borne disease have been confirmed. The California Department of Public Health announced 2 new cases and confirmed reports of the death of a Pennsylvania man and a non-fatal case involving a Californian, bringing the total number of cases linked to the park to 6.

2 people -- the Pennsylvania man and a California man -- have died. The remaining cases all involve California residents who are recovering, said Yosemite spokeswoman Kari Cobb.

Officials have shut down the 91 "signature tent cabins" in Curry Village, where they traced some cases to deer mouse droppings found in the area. The 1st 3 victims all stayed in cabins within 100 feet of one another in mid-June [2012]. Cobb said officials are still trying to determine where the other victims stayed.

Only 587 hantavirus cases have been confirmed in the U.S. between 1993 - 2011. About one-3rd of those cases have been fatal.

Spread through droppings, saliva or urine of infected mice -- or dirt and dust containing those byproducts -- [Sin Nombre] hantavirus [infection] takes 1-6 weeks to show [symptoms] in humans. Symptoms are initially flu-like, but can quickly turn deadly as one's lungs begin to fill with fluid.

Some recent Yosemite visitors expressed concern. A man spent the weekend of 18 Aug [2012] in a Curry Village cabin with his wife and 10-year-old son, part of a summer holiday from Bristol, England. Loughran said that when they arrived to stay at the non-signature cabins, they were not advised about the disease. More unsettling, the man said, were the "layers of dust" and leftover almonds his family discovered underneath their beds. "I still think our risk is very low, but there's just uncertainty," Loughran said. "We don't know what's going on right now."

Another man, 46, of Burbank [California] stayed in Curry Village about 2 weeks ago with his wife, 3 young children and in-laws. They weren't in the signature tents, but Ishkhanian said he spotted a deer mouse climbing on one of the family's bicycles during their stay. They've spoken to 2 doctors and are waiting to see if any symptoms show. "Right now we're just waiting for that 5-week period to be over," he said. "We're a little nervous."

[The hantavirus in this month's [August 2012] reports from California is doubtless Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic there. Its rodent host is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_. It is unusual to have these 6 cases occur in a single, very limited focal area, Curry Village, within the space of 2 months. This suggests that the deer mouse population is abundant in Curry Village, and perhaps supporting active virus transmission and shedding there at this time.
