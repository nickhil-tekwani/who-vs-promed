A horse euthanased on a far north Queensland property this week has been confirmed as having Hendra virus, authorities say.

Test results on Friday [2 Nov 2012] night confirmed the latest case, the 8th Hendra virus incident in Queensland this year [2012] and the 2nd in Ingham, north of Townsville.

Queensland Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Rick Symons today [3 Nov 2012] said the horse was 1st noticed to be sick by its owner on Wednesday [31 Oct 2012] afternoon.

Dr Symons said a private veterinarian treated the horse as a potential Hendra virus case due to the sudden onset of signs including neurological signs, lethargy and a lack of appetite.

By Thursday [1 Nov 2012] afternoon, the horse's condition had deteriorated, and a decision was made to euthanize the horse.

"Biosecurity Queensland officers were on-site this morning and have quarantined the property," Dr Symons said in a statement today [3 Nov 2012]. "They will also undertake tracing as a priority to assess whether any other animals were at risk of being exposed to the virus. Restrictions apply to moving horses and horse materials on and off the infected property, and the property will be quarantined for at least one month."

Queensland Health experts are determining whether anyone had contact with the infected horse.

Queensland's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young reassured the community that transmission of the virus required close contact with bodily fluids of an infected horse.

This year [2012], there have been Hendra cases in Townsville, Cairns, Ingham, Mackay, Port Douglas and Rockhampton.

All of the other quarantines have been lifted.

A Hendra vaccine is ready to ease the scourge of the dreaded equine illness after predictions it will be available by the end of the year [2012].

Warwick Vet Clinic's Chris Reardon said it was good news for the SouthernDowns. "This vaccine, which will protect horses from the deadly virus, has the potential to dramatically reduce the prevalence of this disease," Dr Reardon said.

The vaccine, based on a glycoprotein of the virus cell wall, has been developed by a commercial manufacturer and is the culmination of research work by the CSIRO's Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong and the Henry Jackson Foundation in the United States.

With an active horse community throughout the region, Dr Reardon said, the vaccine would offer local horsemen and women peace of mind.

"A lot of our clients compete in shows and carnivals in areas where there have been outbreaks of Hendra virus, and we would think that they would be keen to have the added protection of having their horse protected with this vaccine," he said.

Dr Reardon said the vaccine, which would soon be available for use by vets, had been released under a minor-use permit. "By having the minor-use permit, we are able to get access to this vaccine and start using it much earlier to protect horses and the horse owners from this disease," Dr Reardon said. "We are required to record all information about the vaccine and identify the horses being vaccinated with the use of microchip identification."

Any healthy horse over 4 months of age can have the vaccine, with 2 shots 3 weeks apart required for initial immunisation, and vets will need to have specific training.

The Australian Veterinarian Association (AVA) encouraged all horse owners to consider using this vaccine.

"In line with good biosecurity principles, the AVA encourages Hendra vaccines to be a condition for all horses entering pleasure of performance events where close contact with humans is likely," Dr Reardon said.

The deadly Hendra virus might have finally met its match. A vaccine is now available for use in horses in Australia, which should stop the virus killing them as well as preventing transmission to humans.

Hendra occurs naturally in flying foxes -- a kind of fruit bat -- without harming them. The virus was originally identified when it killed 13 racehorses and their trainer in a town called Hendra in Queensland, Australia in 1994. It is thought to have spread between the animals when the horses ate grass that had been defecated on.

Then the virus almost disappeared for a decade, with only one outbreak in 1999, before re-emerging every year since 2004. Since it was discovered, the virus has killed about 80 horses and spread to 7 people who came into contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals. Four of the 7 died.

In recent years, the virus has been infecting horses more frequently. In 2011, there were as many Hendra outbreaks in horses in Australia as there were in the previous 15 years, says Deborah Middleton, a veterinary pathologist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Geelong, Australia, who led the development of the new vaccine. "We don't know if these waves of spillover are just part of the life cycle of the virus, but the worry was there was a trend."

In 2011, a team at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland developed a vaccine that protected monkeys against Hendra. Researchers from there collaborated with the drug company Pfizer and CSIRO to produce the vaccine for horses. Middleton says the vaccine could potentially be modified for use in humans.

But Dominic Dwyer, a medical virologist at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia, who runs one of the country's few high-security pathology labs, says that because there have only been a few human cases, it will be hard to develop and test a vaccine, as well as justify the effort. If the vaccine could be used as a treatment post-exposure, as the rabies vaccine can, then this would bolster the case for a human Hendra vaccine, he points out.

Ben Gardiner, the president of the Australian Veterinary Association, has urged that all horses, even those not in Queensland and north New South Wales -- the high-risk areas -- be vaccinated.

Dwyer says it is essential to understand and deal with animal viruses, since the majority of new human viral pathogens arise from contact with animals. According to Dwyer, 3/4ths of new viruses that have infected humans in the past 20 years have come from animals. "And probably the other 25 per cent have too; we just couldn't figure it out," he says.

He adds that Hendra should be monitored in bat populations around the country, as the virus will never be totally eradicated and could pose a threat to people who handle them.

[Clearly, Hendra virus season is continuing, but now there is a new weapon and a new measure of hope. There is a vaccine available for horses.

It is not uncommon for vaccines to be 1st released under some type of limited use permit. In the case of the vaccine for Hendra virus, training for veterinarians may be particularly important. Hendra virus also affects human beings, and there is no vaccine to protect people. Veterinarians need to know how to protect themselves and the consequences of accidental injection or exposure to the vaccine. They need to know where to inject the animals and how to treat a reaction to the vaccine.

On the original page of the 3rd article is a picture of needle in the vein of a horse. It is unclear whether the vaccine is to be administered intravenously, which seems unlikely, or whether this is a stock photo of a veterinarian drawing blood from a horse and has nothing to do with the vaccine itself.

Since the vaccine is based on a glycoprotein of the virus cell wall, it is unlikely that it is a modified live vaccine. It is also unlikely that the virus should be administered intravenously. However, I cannot find information on the injection specifics or more about the specific training for veterinarians.

I would suspect that government officials in conjunction with the AVA and other state authorities are working to coordinate rapid and approved training to keep veterinarians and staff safe regarding this vaccine and the proper usage of the vaccine.

This is a significant breakthrough for Australia and for the vaccine. We celebrate with them and look forward to more information on the use of the vaccine. We celebrate with horse owners who will be seeking the protective mechanism for their animals.
