Bird flu continues at Iranian poultry farms
-------------------------------------------
Epidemic bird flu has been continuing at some Iranian poultry farms,
Mehr News Agency reported on Thursday [15 Jun 2011].

The epidemic diseases, including bird flu, have diffused because of
lacking enough hygienic and health standards at poultry farms.

The source of bird flu, discovered in domestic poultry farms 3 months
ago, is still unbridled.

[On 15 Apr 2011, an unofficial, well-versed source in Iran provided
information on AI "widely spread" in Iran, naming several of the
locations where outbreaks apparently occurred (see 20110415.1181).
ProMED-mail's 2 requests for information (RFI's) have, thus far,
remained unresponded. The current information on AI, published by an
Iranian News Agency, is the background for this repeated RFI.

The most recent officially reported outbreak of HPAI occurred in
December 2007 (a single outbreak in a backyard chicken farm in
Northern Iran, on the shores of the Caspian Sea). The report, with an
interactive map, is available at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6685.

In case confirmed, complementary data on the epidemiology (including
geography, species, populations affected, and particularly the
identity of the causative agent) as well as on applied measures, will
be much appreciated. - Mod.AS]
