Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever - WHO Update 3
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 29 Mar 2005, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of 124
cases and 117 deaths in Cabinda, Luanda and Uige. All these cases had
originated in Uige Province. 10 of these cases have been
laboratory-confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), Atlanta, USA.
The team from WHO, including experts from the Inter-country program for
southern Africa, the Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) and from
Headquarters and partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network
(GOARN) are supporting the Ministry of Health, Angola to strengthen active
surveillance and contact tracing.
Medecins sans Frontieres (Belgium, France, Holland and Spain) are assisting
with infection control and establishing isolation facilities in Uige
hospital. Experts from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Manchester,
United Kingdom and Johannesburg Hospital, South Africa are providing
assistance in infection control in Luanda, where training will be provided
for health care staff from all provinces in the country. The Canadian
National Microbiology Laboratory will be setting up a mobile laboratory in
Uige, and CDC will be providing laboratory support in Luanda. UNICEF is
carrying out social mobilization activities, raising awareness of the
disease in the community and also providing additional logistic support and
equipment.
2 travelers returning to Portugal from Angola were investigated for
possible Marburg virus infection, and laboratory results were negative in
tests performed by the Bernard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine,
Hamburg, Germany, a WHO Reference Laboratory.

Angola: outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever; 1 Oct 2004 to 29 Mar 2005
-----------------------------------------------
Brief Report
------------
On 23 Mar 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed Marburg virus
(family _Filoviridae_, which includes Ebola virus) as the causative agent
of an outbreak of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in Uige Province in
northern Angola. Testing conducted by CDC's Special Pathogens Branch
detected the presence of virus in 9 of 12 clinical specimens from patients
who died during the outbreak.
During the period 1 Oct 2004 to 29 Mar 2005, a total of 124 cases were
identified; of these, 117 were fatal (1). Approximately 75 percent of the
reported cases occurred in children aged <5 years; cases also have occurred
in adults, including health-care workers. Predominant symptoms have
included fever, hemorrhage, vomiting, cough, diarrhea, and jaundice.
WHO and international partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network (GOARN) are working with the Ministry of Health in Angola in
conducting an investigation and public health response to the outbreak.
Outbreak-control efforts are directed at providing technical support for
case management, strengthening infection control in hospitals, improving
surveillance and contact tracing, and educating local residents about the
disease and its modes of transmission.
As part of the public health response, CDC will be sending personnel to
join the WHO-coordinated GOARN response team to assist with epidemiologic
investigation, infection control, and laboratory diagnosis. In addition,
CDC will continue to provide laboratory and other scientific and logistical
support. On 25 Mar 2005, CDC posted a notice on its website to inform
travelers about the outbreak (available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/marburg_vhf_angola_2005.htm>). This
website will be updated as new information becomes available. No U.S.
travel restrictions to the affected area are recommended at this time.
Marburg virus disease presents as an acute febrile illness and can progress
within 6 to 8 days to severe hemorrhagic manifestations. After an
incubation period of 5 to 10 days, onset of the disease is sudden and is
marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Approximately the 5th day
after onset of symptoms, a maculopapular rash might occur, after which,
nausea, vomiting, chest pain, sore throat, abdominal pain, and diarrhea
might appear. Signs and symptoms become increasingly severe and can include
jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium,
shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging, and multi-organ dysfunction.
Fatality rates for outbreaks of Marburg VHF have ranged from approximately
25 percent to 80 percent; mortality has been higher in outbreaks in which
effective case management was lacking. No vaccine or curative treatment is
available, and supportive treatment should be used. The virus can be spread
to humans through direct contact with body fluids (e.g., blood, saliva, and
urine) of an infected person or animal. Thus, the best protection for
persons in or traveling to the outbreak area is to avoid direct contact
with body fluids from potentially infected persons. Virus transmission also
might be possible through contact with objects (e.g., medical equipment)
that have been contaminated with infectious material. The virus has been
reported to survive for as long as several days on contaminated surfaces
(2). Hospital infection-control practices for infected patients should
include contact and droplet precautions, in addition to wearing eye
protection or a face shield. U.S. clinicians caring for patients with
suspected Marburg virus infection should contact CDC or local public health
officials for additional information about VHF infection control.
Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of Marburg VHF among febrile
patients who, within 10 days before onset of fever, have either 1) traveled
in northern Angola; 2) had direct contact with blood, other body fluids,
secretions, or excretions of a person or animal suspected of having VHF; or
3) worked in a laboratory or animal facility that handles hemorrhagic fever
viruses (3). The likelihood of acquiring VHF is considered extremely low in
persons who do not meet any of these criteria. The cause of fever in
persons who have traveled to areas where VHF is endemic is more likely to
be a different infectious disease.
Reports of Marburg virus disease are rare, and its occurrence has been
limited to countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The environmental reservoir of
the virus is unknown. The current outbreak in Angola is the 1st report of
Marburg virus disease since 1998-2000, when the largest known outbreak
occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo, resulting in 149 cases and
123 deaths (4).

Angola: unofficial death toll now 130
-----------------------------------------
At least 3 African nations are on alert after an outbreak of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever claimed a record toll in Angola, as a senior official in
the worst-affected area on Wed 30 Mar 2005 accused Luanda of apathy.
Health alerts have been issued in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),
which borders Angola and where the 2nd highest number of deaths due to the
virus was previously recorded, in Congo-Brazzaville, and as far as the
eastern African country of Kenya.
Kenya's health ministry said earlier on Wednesday [30 Mar 2005] that it had
set up a system at the country's 2 main airports in Nairobi and Mombasa to
screen passengers arriving from Angola. An alert was issued to all
hospitals and clinics in Kenya, which recorded 3 cases of the disease in
the 1980s. Angola's neighbor, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) went
on high alert on Tuesday [29 Mar 2005], issuing protective kits.
Congo has also stepped up health controls along its border with the DRC in
order to reduce the possibility of the outbreak spreading, the health
ministry said.
Meanwhile, Quiala Godi, the number 2 health official in the northern
Angolan town of Uige -- the epicenter of the virus -- was critical of
Luanda's response. "We have reached the peak of the Marburg epidemic. What
worries me is the lack of support from the government. We haven't received
a single government team here in Uige," Godi said. "The hospital is
closed," he said, speaking of the sole health facility there. "Even the
emergency services are shut down. Only international experts from the World
Health Organization and Medecins sans Frontieres are here." Godi said there
were 4 more deaths on Tue 29 Mar 2005, 2 in Uige and 2 at the nearby town
of Negage, about 30 km away. This takes the unofficial toll to 130.
Luanda's provincial health director, Vita Mvemba, on Monday [28 Mar 2005],
appealed for international assistance, saying the southern African country,
which only recently emerged from a brutal 27-year civil war, had only 1200
doctors nationwide.
