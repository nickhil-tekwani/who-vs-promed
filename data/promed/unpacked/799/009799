Epidemiological summary
- Nigeria continues to report sporadic cases of monkeypox since the beginning of 2018.
- In the reporting month, 15 new suspected monkeypox cases were reported, out of which 6 confirmed cases were recorded in 5 states (Rivers -1, Bayelsa -2, Delta -1, Cross Rivers -1, Edo -1)
- A total of 114 suspected, 45 confirmed, one probable cases and one death have been reported in 2018. The 45 cases confirmed were recorded in 13 states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Delta, Oyo, Cross River, Edo, Enugu, Imo, Lagos, Plateau, Abia, Anambra, and Nasarawa)
- Since the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017, 311 suspected cases have been reported in 26 states. Of these, 132 confirmed cases in 17 states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Cross River, Imo, Akwa Ibom, Lagos, Delta, Edo, FCT, Abia, Oyo, Enugu, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Benue, Plateau, Anambra) and 7 deaths were recorded.
- Genetic sequencing suggests multiple sources of introduction of monkeypox virus into the human population with evidence of human-to-human transmission.
- Males are more affected with 73.3% of confirmed cases in 2018.
- Persons within the 21-40 age group are more affected.

[The number of monkeypox cases in Nigeria continues to slowly but steadily increase. Monkeypox virus transmission continues over a broad geographic area in Nigeria this year (2018). The above report provides the most recent update of the monkeypox situation in Nigeria. This outbreak has been unusual. Rather than sporadic or rare cases, there have been over 100 cases scattered over a large geographic area this year. The reasons for this relatively sudden appearance are not clear. Perhaps there has been an epizootic of monkeypox virus infections among its rodent hosts, with spillover to people. As mentioned earlier, prevention will require a proactive public education effort to convince local people to take measures to prevent contact with the infected rodents and their excreta to avoid transmission, a difficult task involving so many local people over such a large geographic area.

Interested readers can see the graph of cases by week and a map showing the location of cases by state.

Non-human primates are not monkeypox virus reservoirs. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp, an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents (genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). - Mod.TY
