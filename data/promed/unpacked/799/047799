NEW DISEASE OUTBREAKS - OIE
NEWCASTLE DISEASE, PIGEONS - LUXEMBOURG
---------------------------------------
A single outbreak in the north of the country involving a 100 bird flock is
reported. The isolate was a velogenic paramyxovirus. Virus isolation was
on cell culture (brain: negative; organs: positive). A "stamping out"
policy including depopulation of the affected flock is in place. Contact
with wild pigeons is noted as the source of infection.

FOLLOW-UP REPORTS ON OUTBREAKS - OIE

ANTHRAX, HORSE - TAIWAN
-----------------------
[see Anthrax, horse - Taiwan 991201234433
see also OIE Disease Information, 12 [46], 168, dated 3 December 1999]
Samples of blood from the non-affected 33 horses and 3 dogs, and of the
feed, soil, mattresses and dung in the polo club were collected for anthrax
detection. All the samples were anthrax negative. National active
surveillance for disease in horse, goats and cattle is ongoing.

BLUETONGUE, SHEEP - GREECE
--------------------------

Bluetongue - Greece (02) 990823212124
OIE Disease Information, 12 [35], 126, dated 10 September 1999]

This follow-up report contains detailed results of ongoing surveillance on
both the mainland and the island of Lesvos after the initial incursion of
the disease. Tables contain interesting details of both clinical and
serological surveillance. The highest clinical prevalence areas are
Chalkidiki and Evia prefectures, with 9% of the sheep flocks, 2% of the
sheep and within flock prevalence of almost 20%. The report also contains
information on seroprevalence in sheep, cattle and goats, one outbreak
resulting in a 26% seropositive rate in cattle. Results of light trapping
of _Culicoides_ species are given, but virus recovery results from these
insects are not available in this report.
This report also indicates multiple strains of BTV circulating as evidence
by BTV Serotyping results which include:
- Isolates from Lesvos and south-eastern Evros have been neutralized with
BTV Type 4 anti-serum.
- Isolates from Rodopi have been neutralized with BTV Type 9 anti-serum.
- Isolates from Dodekanissa have been neutralized with BTV Type 4
anti-serum.
It should be noted that the epizootics in Dodekanissa in the winter of 1998
and in Bulgaria in the summer of 1999 were due to BTV Type 9.
