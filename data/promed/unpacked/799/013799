The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry confirmed the finding of vesicular stomatitis virus, also known as VSV, at a premises in Washington County. The horse showed lesions in its mouth and on its muzzle.

VSV is a viral disease of horses, donkeys, mules, cattle, and swine. Initial symptoms include excessive salivation and reluctance to eat or drink. Clinical signs include vesicles, erosions, and sloughing of the skin on the muzzle, tongue, ears, teats, and coronary bands of their hooves. Lameness or weight loss may follow. Body temperature may rise immediately before or when lesions first appear.

So far in 2020, VSV has been reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Arizona, and Texas.

What livestock owners need to know:
- VSV affects primarily horses and cattle;
- VSV normally has an incubation period of 2-8 days before the infected animal develops blisters which swell and burst, leaving painful sores;
- the virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or by blood-feeding insects;
- if VSV is confirmed, infected animals are quarantined for 14 days after clinical signs of lesions are observed. This short-term quarantine helps prevent the movement of animals and the spread of the disease to other premises, fairs, or markets;
- humans can also become infected with VSV, but it is a very rare event.

Recommended actions:
There is currently no United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)-approved vaccination for VSV. Even with the best defensive measures, VSV could infect a herd.
However, these tips could help protect livestock:
- control biting flies;
- keep equines stalled or under a roof at night to reduce exposure to flies;
- keep stalls clean;
- feed and water stock in individual buckets;
- don't visit any premise that is under quarantine.
Veterinarians and livestock owners who suspect VSV in their animals should immediately contact the OK State Veterinarians office.

In its 2 Jul 2020 situation report, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed that although officials have identified one new Maricopa County [Arizona] premises with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), 3 previously affected or suspect premises in the county have been released from VSV quarantine.

Maricopa County now contains 7 confirmed positive and 1 suspect premises, bringing the state's totals to 18 confirmed positive premises and one suspect premises:
- Apache (2 confirmed positive premises);
- Cochise (4 confirmed positive);
- Gila (1 confirmed positive);
- Maricopa (7 confirmed positive; 1 suspect);
- Pima (1 confirmed positive);
- Pinal (2 confirmed positive); and
- Santa Cruz (1 confirmed positive).

Since the last situation report on 24 Jun 2020, 7 previously infected or suspect premises in Arizona have been released from quarantine:
- Butler (5);
- Cowley (1); and
- Sedgwick (1).

Other VSV-positive states in 2020 include Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Texas.

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

In its 7 Jul 2020 situation report, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed a new Buffalo County [Nebraska] equine premises with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). This is the county's 2nd affected premises. The state's (and Buffalo County's) index case was confirmed on 24 Jun 2020. Veterinarians quarantine and monitor premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected.

Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks. Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the western hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The south western and western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks ... Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

[4] How to protect your horse

To help you protect your horses, we at TheHorse.com are sharing measures recommended by experts in a recent Journal of Equine Veterinary Science review article [see reference below].

Insect control
--------------
Because biting insects are the most common source of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), the best way to prevent VS is to remove insects from the horse and his habitat. The researchers specify f4our spatial scales you can use to reduce risk:
1. Neighborhood:
- rotate pastures to avoid grazing during periods of water's base flow just following peak runoff, which a hydrology study found correlated with past outbreaks;
- move horses to higher-elevation pastures (4000 feet and above [1230 metres and more]) during high-vector seasons;
- pesticides might be prohibited near drinking water sources; try propane-fueled insect traps that emit insect-attracting carbon dioxide, placed between insects' breeding habitat and horses' premises.

2. Premises:
- provide a run-in shed that horses can use to escape insects;
- remove manure regularly to reduce insect habitat;
- provide good drainage (slope, well-drained sand, and porous gravel) around water sources to minimize habitat for water- and mud-loving insects;
- keep vegetation short to minimize insects' favored breeding and living areas;
- manage irrigation to minimize pooled water and mud in fields.

3. Shelter:
- keep animals indoors during insects' active feeding periods (do some research to determine which insects are your area's most common vectors and plan accordingly);
- install mesh nets (0.1825 square millimetre pore size) or repellent-treated fabric on doors and windows or around stalls, or use as an outdoor net-shed;
- install downward-blowing fans to keep insects off horses;
- minimize bright insect-attracting lights at night, including light traps and bug zappers.

4. Animal:
- apply topical repellents and insecticides with the understanding that they aren't equally effective on all insect species;
- use protective horsewear such as fly sheets, leg wraps, fly masks, and ear nets, especially those treated with synthetic pyrethroids such as pyrethrin, permethrin, and deltamethrin. but note that these substances only protect the areas directly under the treated fabric;
- reduce exposure to the parts of the horse's body that biting insects favor most: belly, legs, flanks, hindquarters, ears, and abrasion sites.

Take-home message
The study authors concluded that owners must do their research to learn which insects in their area are threats and tailor prevention approaches accordingly. With due diligence and careful management, you can significantly reduce the risk of your horse contracting VS.
