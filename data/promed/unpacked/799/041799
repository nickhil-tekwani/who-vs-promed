A devastating disease that has wiped out amphibians around the world has been discovered in Madagascar, scientists report. A survey has found that the chytrid fungus is present in numerous sites, although it is not clear whether it is infecting frogs yet.

The island is home to 500 frog species, and researchers fear they could be at significant risk. The findings are published in the journal Scientific Reports. One of the authors, Goncalo Rosa, from the Zoological Society of London, said he was worried about the impact that the fungus could have. "It is heartbreaking, especially when you have an idea of what is happening elsewhere in other tropical areas -- you see the frogs are gone," he told BBC News. "The same could happen to Madagascar as well."

The chytrid fungus has been found across the island, but it is not yet clear if it is killing frogs. The chytrid fungus (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_) was first identified in the 1990s and has swept across the world. It infects the animals through their skin, and has killed off vast numbers of amphibians.

Madagascar was thought to be one of the last places free from the disease, but now the fungus has been confirmed in several sites across the island. Scientists are trying to establish whether the fungus has always been present, but just not detected, or whether it has spread from elsewhere.

Mr Rosa said: "If these findings represent endemic chytrid, it means it has been there forever, coexisting with these frogs. "But if we are talking about a recent introduction, this is really worrying because we've seen what has happened in other places. And if frogs in Madagascar have never coexisted with the fungus, it could be catastrophic -- this could cause huge biodiversity loss."

Many of Madagascar's frogs are not found anywhere else in the world. Conservationists are particularly worried because Madagascar is an amphibian haven. Many of its 500 species of frog are not found anywhere else in the world. "This is what makes Madagascar this special and unique place," said Mr Rosa.

If the disease is a new arrival, scientists will try to work out how it got to the island. It can be carried on people's clothes or by invasive species, such as the recently introduced Asian common toad. Researchers are now trying to establish where the disease has spread. But with no cure, it may be difficult to limit the impact it has on Madagascar's unique amphibians.

_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ (Bd, chytrid fungus) is a singular fungal pathogen. It has a swimming zoospore as the infectious stage. It colonizes skin cells of adult amphibians and the mouthparts of tadpoles. Infection occurs when zoospores land on the skin or the mouthparts and encyst. Through mechanisms that are not fully understood, the pathogen moves from the surface of the skin to the stratum granulosum of the epidermis and matures in the stratum corneum. There, it enters healthy cells, grows in size, and develops into an urn-shaped zoosporangium in which the zoospores develop. As infected skin cells move toward the surface, the zoosporangium matures, the discharge papilla opens, and mature zoospores swim out. The mechanism by which this pathogen causes disease seems to be by interference with the ion transport functions of the skin, leading eventually to cardiac failure.

The question whether the fungus was already in Madagascar or not is crucial. Previous intensive field surveys have failed to detect the chytrid fungus in Madagascar. However, Bd was detected by PCR from 3 frogs from 3 different species that were exported from Madagascar (see http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089660). The absence of reported amphibian die-offs is encouraging, but efforts should be undertaken to monitor frog populations across Madagascar and test for the presence of the fungus. - Mod.PMB
