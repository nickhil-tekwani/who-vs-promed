Imperial Valley conditions limit Karnal bunt in wheat.
California Agriculture 51(3):29-33. - Mod PKA]
Karnal Bunt (KB) is a minor disease of wheat that until March 8,
1996, was of little concern to the US grain industry. On that
date, scientists at USDA's Agricultural Research Service
confirmed the presence of Karnal bunt in Arizona-certified durum
wheat seed (cv. Reva), produced near Gila Bend, Arizona. Seed
from infested seed lots was planted in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas
and California. Fourteen fields amounting to about 960 acres,
primarily of the cultivar Kronos, were planted with infected seed
in the Imperial Valley of California. As part of a larger effort
to prevent the spread of KB, wheat in the Imperial Valley was
placed under a federal quarantine. Fields in the quarantine area
had to be tested for KB prior to harvest and again before
shipment. All preharvest samples taken from fields in the
Imperial Valley (1,476) tested negative for the presence of KB
teliospores.
Distribution and severity
-------------------------
Karnal bunt is indigenous to India, first being reported near the
town of Karnal in 1931. The disease also occurs in Syria,
Lebanon, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Mexico. It affects
common wheat and to a lesser degree durum wheat, triticale and
rye. Estimates of loss due to KB are difficult since the disease
can reduce seed quality but usually only minimally affects grain
yield. Since the disease is seedborne and many countries have a
zero tolerance policy, indirect costs are incurred in preventing
its spread, while losses in marketing opportunities arise because
of its presence. Karnal bunt can be a severe disease, and losses
ranging from 5 to 20% have been reported. However, even during
years of severe epidemics in India, the total damage to the wheat
crop ranged from 0.3 to 0.5% of total production.
Symptoms
--------
Karnal bunt usually is noticed first when broken and/or partially
smutted kernels are seen in threshed grain. However, symptoms
are present at the soft-dough stage in the form of blackened
areas surrounding the base of the grain, which extend upward
along the suture to varying degrees. Unless the disease is
severe, only a few florets per spike are affected and diseased
spikes are not conspicuous because the glumes are not distorted
by infected kernels. In severely infected spikes, however, the
glumes may spread apart near maturity, exposing the bunted
grains. Infected grains are irregularly distributed in the spike;
some are completely infected, but most are partially infected
(hence the alternate common name of the disease, partial bunt).
The weight of infected grains is directly related to the severity
of infection; as the degree of infection increases, the weight of
the grains correspondingly decreases.
While diseased seeds often retain a partial seed coat, the embryo
and part of the endosperm can be converted to masses of small
black spores, which emit a fishy odor (due to the presence of
trimethylamine) similar to common bunt. Partially bunted seeds
often retain their capacity to germinate, and grains with trace-
to-moderately-low infections may produce healthy plants.
The causal organism
-------------------
_Tilletia indica_ Mitra (syn. _Neovossia indica_ [Mitra] Mundk.)
is in the Class Basidiomycetes, Order Ustilaginales, Family
Tilletiaceae. Teliospores are 22 to 49 um in diameter, more or
less spherical, black in color and have a slightly rough surface.
The teliospores are nearly twice the size of those of the related
species _Tilletia caries_ and _Tilletia controversa_, causal
organism of common and dwarf bunt, respectively. The teliospores
of KB bear truncate projections surrounded by a delicate
membranous sheath.
Germinating teliospores form promycelia and produce numerous
haploid, sickle-shaped sporidia (frequently more than 100) in a
whorl at the apex. The sporidia do not fuse but germinate
directly to form hyphae and/or uninucleate alantoid secondary
sporidia, which are forcibly discharged into the air. Primary
sporidia have dimensions ranging from 64 to 79 um in length and
1.6 to 1.8 um in width. Secondary sporidia have dimensions
ranging from 12 to 13 um in length and about 2 um in width.
Disease cycle
-------------
Sources of inoculum are diseased seed and soil contaminated with
spores from previous crops. The delicate pericarp surrounding
each sorus of teliospores is easily broken during harvest,
dispersing the spores to contaminate the soil. There are no data
available to determine the relationship between the teliospore
load per seed and subsequent disease appearance in the field.
Environment plays a primary role in disease development
(Smilanick et al. 1985). The teliospores germinate in response
to free moisture and produce numerous sporidia at the soil
surface that are forcibly ejected and then dispersed by wind,
splashing water and insects.
Sporidia have a short life-span, even at high relative humidity
(Smilanick et al., 1989), and generally survive for only a few
hours when air-borne. Long-distance dispersal of secondary
sporidia probably can occur only during moist periods and under
cloud cover at night. Plants are most susceptible to infection
when spikes emerge from the boot, but infection can occur
throughout the flowering period. Sporidia infect the ovaries,
directly penetrating the glumes and ovary wall. Infection can
move across all florets of a spikelet and to the spikelets above
and below the initial infection site. Diseased kernels may be
partially or completely displaced by masses of teliospores in
cool, humid or wet weather. Sporulation starts at the embryo end
and moves along the suture of the grain. The extent of kernel
bunting depends on when infection occurs and how long favorable
conditions last.
Fresh teliospores require a dormancy period of up to 6 months,
although a low level (6.7%) of germination of teliospores from
freshly harvested kernels has been observed after 1 week of
storage. Teliospores remain viable in the soil for up to 45
months. They survive longer when buried in dry soil than in
moist, cropped soils or on the soil surface.
