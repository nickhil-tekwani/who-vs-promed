[1] WHO withdraws staff from Sierra Leone
Date: Tue 26 Aug 2014
Source: Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) News [edited]
http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/who-withdraws-ebola-virus-staff-in-sierra-leone-1.2746945


Protective gear such as gloves and gowns are critical to protect health-care workers from the ebolavirus but don't go far enough, doctors say as the World Health Organization announced it has shut down a laboratory in Sierra Leone after a health worker was infected. To date, more than 240 health-care workers have developed the disease and more than 120 have died, WHO says. The United Nations health agency said it's pulled staff from a laboratory testing for the ebolavirus in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, after a Senegalese epidemiologist was infected. "It's a temporary measure to take care of the welfare of our remaining workers," WHO spokesperson Christy Feig told Reuters, without specifying how long the measure would last. "After our assessment, they will return."

The Senegalese worker is under treatment at a government hospital in the eastern town of Kenema and will be evacuated from Sierra Leone, Feig said. "This was the responsible thing to do. The field team has been through a traumatic time through this incident," said Dr Daniel Kertesz, WHO Representative in Sierra Leone, in a release. "They are exhausted from many weeks of heroic work, helping patients infected with EVD. When you add a stressor like this, the risk of accidents increases."

In a commentary published in Tuesday's [26 Aug 2014] online issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, US doctors called personal protective equipment designed to shield health-care workers from contaminated body fluids of EVD patients critical, but not enough to prevent transmission. "If transmission of EVD is effectively interrupted with the use of barrier protection, why are so many health-care workers in the current outbreak being infected, particularly this late in the epidemic? 2 contributing factors include an insufficient supply of [personal protective equipment, PPE] and a lack of emphasis on the process of donning and doffing PPE," wrote Dr. William Fischer II from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and his co-authors.

Several other factors contribute, they said, such as:

- The difficulty health-care workers face in clinically recognizing ebolavirus infection, which often presents with symptoms including fever, fatigue and diarrhea that mirror more common ailments in sub-Saharan Africa such as typhoid fever and malaria.
- Limited supplies of PPE including gloves, gowns and face masks.
- Inadequate training in standard precautions.
- Poor public health infrastructure.

Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone also have few doctors -- fewer than an estimated 0.1 physicians per capita. Even when health-care workers wear PPE, the commentators said, they are at risk of contamination with infectious fluids if the clothing isn't removed properly. The impulse to wipe away sweat in the hot, humid and exhausting environment may also lead to inadvertent infection, they said. The commentators suggest that treatment sites mitigate the risks associated with removing protective gear by providing a separate exit, physically removed from the entrance, to ensure those donning the equipment don't come into contact with those who may be contaminated, and that a dedicated person stationed at the exit focuses on guiding all health-care providers through each step of removing the equipment.

Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], was in Liberia on Tuesday [26 Aug 2014]. He also plans to stop in Sierra Leone and Guinea. "Lots of hard work is happening, lots of good things are happening," Frieden told a meeting attended by President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Monday [25 Aug 2014]. "But the virus still has the upper hand." Frieden told Liberian TV that stopping the spread of ebolavirus "requires tremendous attention to every detail."

In Britain, a volunteer nurse who tested positive for the virus after working in Sierra Leone has been given the experimental drug ZMapp, according to the London hospital that is treating him. William Pooley, 29, was flown home on Sunday [24 Aug 2014] in a specially adapted Royal Air Force cargo plane. He was taken to an isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital in north London.

Meanwhile, Ivory Coast's [Cote d'Ivoire's] football federation said Tuesday [26 Aug 2014] that it had been instructed by its government to cancel or move next month's [September 2014] home game against Sierra Leone, one of the most affected countries in the West African Ebola outbreak.

[It would appear that the WHO epidemiologist, whose work would normally take him out into the community, was in the laboratory at some point and is thought to have become infected there by unknown means, hence the fear among the lab workers and their precautionary withdrawal. - Mod.JW]

[2] Canada: donating experimental vaccine (update)

Canada to donate experimental ebolavirus vaccine
------------------------------------------------
Canada is to donate 800-1000 doses of an experimental ebolavirus vaccine to the World Health Organization (WHO) for use in Africa. Canadian Health Minister Rona Ambrose announced the news on Tuesday [12 Aug 2014] after a panel of medical ethicists convened by the WHO said using experimental-stage Ebola drugs is justified. Several experimental drugs offered grounds for hope, WHO health innovation Chief Marie-Paule Kieny has said... "Our government is committed to doing everything we can to support our international partners, including providing staff to assist with the outbreak response, funding and access to our experimental vaccine," Ambrose said in a statement. 10 doses of the drug known as VSV-EBOV have been sent to a hospital in Geneva, at the request of the WHO, and to the aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres as an emergency supply.

[Canada's 1st announcement of this donation on 14 Aug 2014 was posted in ProMED Ebola virus disease - West Africa (133) [6] Misc. This update has further details. Even if Canada releases most of its existing doses, experts warn it could take 4-6 months to make a quantity large enough to have any real impact at preventing the illness, the BBC's Lee Carter reports from Toronto. While vaccines normally are preventatives, the VSV-EBOV vaccine has shown effectiveness in studies on animals after they were exposed to the virus. It may be used soon after someone was exposed to infection, similar to the way rabies shots are used now, according to Gary Kobinger, chief of special pathogens for the Public Health Agency of Canada. - Mod.JW]

Russia donates EVD diagnostic lab to Guinea
-------------------------------------------
To help with the current and possible future battles with Ebola virus disease (EVD), the Russian government gave the government in Conakry, Guinea, a mobile diagnostic laboratory equipped to work with the lethal virus, according to a Le Jour Guinee report Monday [25 Aug 2014]. In a ceremony attended by diplomats from the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Guinea and representatives of the company Rusal Guinea, the laboratory, valued at USD 5 million, was given to battle EVD.

[4] Quarantine
Date: Mon 25 Aug 2014
Source: The Disease Daily [edited]
http://healthmap.org/site/diseasedaily/article/ebola-quarantine-or-not-quarantine-82514


Throughout the current EVD outbreak in West Africa, there have been reports of voluntary and government-ordered isolation and quarantine. The use of these terms has led to significant fear due to misconceptions about the terms "quarantine" and "isolation", and what this means in relation to infection with ebolavirus.

What is quarantine?
-------------------
Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of healthy people, who may have been exposed to an infected person. The duration of quarantine is generally the length of the disease's incubation period, taking into consideration the individual's suspected time of exposure [21 days in the case of EVD]. This is different from isolation, which is the separation and restriction of movement of already infected individuals.

Why are people quarantined?
---------------------------
Quarantines allow health authorities to prevent further spread of a disease in the event the quarantined individual develops clinical symptoms of the disease of concern. Quarantine is just a precautionary measure, preventing possibly sick individuals from infecting others (therefore breaking the line of transmission). Quarantined individuals often turn out to not have the disease, but the risk of spread within a community is so great that health authorities deem it appropriate to watch over the individuals until they know they are uninfected.

There has been much debate over the benefits and drawbacks of significant quarantines, border closures and travel restrictions during this and other outbreaks. The detrimental effects of widespread quarantines were discussed in an article published by the World Health Organization on 23 Aug 2014: "WHO reiterated that it does not recommend any ban on international travel or trade. It stresses that closing borders doesn't work and is detrimental, as affected countries will be pushed towards a humanitarian crisis and the international community's ability to fight and reverse the EVD outbreak will be hampered."

Quarantine efforts directed solely at individuals with exposure opportunity are considered an appropriate measure, while wholesale exclusion of populations with no likely exposure risk is considered excessive and potentially counterproductive as the inability to maintain such a large quarantine undermines authority. Isolation and quarantine when used appropriately are critical tools in curtailing outbreaks.
