Romania; Tests Confirm No Sign of Bird Flu in 81-year-old Woman
-----------------------------------------------
Final laboratory tests on Sun [29 Jan 2006] failed to confirm that a
Romanian woman admitted to hospital on Sat 28 Jan 2006 with symptoms
similar to those caused by the H5N1 virus had contracted avian
influenza, an official said. "The patient is feeling well. She does
not have avian influenza," Adrian Streinu-Cercel, head of Romania's
main virus laboratory told a news conference.
The Black Sea state has found the avian flu in poultry in 26 villages
since October 2005 but has recorded no human cases.

Iraq: Health Minister Announces Dead Teenager Did Have Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
The Iraqi girl who died on 17 Jan 2006 in the Kurdish city of
Sulaimaniya had avian influenza, Iraq's Health Minister announced on
Monday [30 Jan 2006], despite the World Health Organization (WHO)
having initially ruled out [H5N1 virus] as the cause of death. The
WHO said it was asking for further tests to be carried out in a
laboratory in Britain and was sending a mission to Iraq to assess the
situation. "The test of the teenager's blood confirmed that she had
[contracted the type of] bird flu [that has caused the death of
humans]," Iraqi Health Minister Abdul Muttalib Mohammed Ali told a
news briefing in Sulaimaniya, referring to the 14-year-old girl. The
WHO said on 19 Jan 2006 that the teenager, who died 2 days earlier,
did not have avian influenza. A WHO spokeswoman said at the weekend
that the statement had been based on tests carried out only in Iraq.
Iraqi officials have warned that the rebel violence and anarchy that
have impoverished Iraq, leaving its frontiers porous and sanitary
regulations unenforceable, would make it very difficult for Baghdad
to control any epidemic among wildfowl and poultry. Bird flu is
endemic in poultry in parts of Asia and can infect people who come
into close contact with infected birds. It has killed at least 83
people since late 2003 and recently spread to Iraq's neighbor,
Turkey, where local officials blame it for the deaths of 4 children.
The Iraqi Health Ministry spokesman Qasim Yahya Allawi told Reuters
that the Ministry had received the positive test results from a U.S.
military facility in Cairo on Sunday [29 Jan 2006] night. The Health
Minister of Iraq's Kurdish region, Mohammed Khashnow, told the news
briefing that teams were being formed to destroy all poultry in
Sulaimaniya. "We ask for people's cooperation," he said.
Zuhair Halaj, head of communicable diseases at the WHO office in
Cairo, said the U.S. military laboratory had "done [a] preliminary
test and [the result] was H5N1-positive ... the next stage is another
test [on isolated virus]. In Iraq, the authorities will move as if it
is confirmed ... A mission from the WHO will travel to Iraq to assess
the situation." The WHO officials said Iraq needed to step up
surveillance, because the human cases, if confirmed, had emerged
without any previous warning that the virus was present in poultry.
"It was ruled out before, because all the indications at the time
were that it was not bird flu ... Tests done in a laboratory in
Baghdad had come back negative," WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng in
Geneva said, explaining why the WHO initially declared the dead
teenager did not have the virus. But she said testing for bird flu
was complex and that it would not be the 1st time that 1st diagnoses
had been revised.
The WHO said on Saturday [28 Jan 2006] it was also carrying out tests
on the girl's uncle, who died last Friday [27 Jan 2006]. Sulaimaniya
is close to Iraq's border with Turkey, where more than 20 people have
been confirmed as having [contracted] the H5N1 virus. "We are always
concerned when we see more human cases, (but)...at the moment, it
looks like 2 isolated cases," assuming that the uncle comes back
positive as well, Cheng said.

[3] Algeria - negative test results in Oran

Algeria: Death of Poultry Breeder Not Due to Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
Algeria announced on Monday [30 Jan 2006] that tests for H5N1 avian
influenza on a deceased poultry breeder had proved negative, easing
fears that had depressed the price of poultry by more than 50
percent. The authorities said last week they were carrying out blood
tests after a poultry breeder died and 3 of his relatives fell ill
and were taken to hospital. "There is no sign of bird flu. The tests
were negative," a health ministry official told Reuters.
Algerian media had reported that the 4 people had shown flu-like
symptoms in the western city of Oran. The reports pushed poultry
prices down more than 50 percent, and breeders, seeing sales
dropping, urged the government to reassure consumers. Algeria plans
to spend 8 billion dinars (USD 111 million) to counter any outbreak
of bird flu. It plans to import more than 7 million doses of
anti-viral drugs and buy 7 million masks for health staff in case of
any outbreak.
Health Minister Amar Tou said last week that no case of the disease
had been reported in people or poultry in Algeria. The authorities
have said they plan to step up health checks at airports and ports to
ensure passengers and goods from countries hit by the virus do not
bring it into the North African country of 33 million.

[4] Turkey - question of low death toll

Turkey: Questions Raised Concerning Virulence of Avian Influenza Virus
-----------------------------------------------
With word yesterday [29 Jan 2006] that all but 3 surviving avian
influenza cases have been discharged from Turkish hospitals,
questions are swirling over whether the world has overestimated the
virulence of the H5N1 virus. Some wonder whether the fatality rate in
the Turkish outbreak -- 4 of 21 cases, if all are confirmed -- is
proof that the assessment of the virus's virulence has been skewed by
a failure to detect mild, even symptomless cases in the other
countries where human infections have been recorded. Could H5N1's
high death toll -- stubbornly hovering over 50 percent -- be the
product of faulty math or of not using the right denominator to
calculate the rate?
Experts caution that people shouldn't read too much into the Turkish
numbers at this point. "I think it's really too early to conclude
anything," says Dr. Guenael Rodier, an infectious disease expert with
the World Health Organization's European office in Copenhagen. Rodier
led the international team that traveled to Turkey to help contain
the outbreak.
"True scientists are patient people. And the ones who are impatient,
I tend to maybe not trust their science, because we know things are
often more complex than anticipated, and it takes time." For one
thing, there is still a theoretical possibility that some of the
Turkish cases may turn out to be false positives. As of Friday [27
Jan 2006], the WHO's collaborating laboratory in Britain had only
concluded confirmatory testing on 12 of the 21 cases. Even if the
London lab confirms all 21, the evidence from the outbreaks in
Southeast Asia and China paints a different picture: a high death
rate and very little sign of the type of mild infections that might
initially evade detection. "The evidence for widespread asymptomatic
infections is just not there," says Michael Perdue, a scientist with
the World Health Organization's global influenza program in Geneva.
Certainly, the odd case here and there probably went unnoticed, the
experts assume. Mild cases are more likely to fall through the
surveillance net than severe ones. But a number of studies have been
done in Viet Nam, Thailand and Indonesia looking for antibodies to
the virus in the blood of people who were exposed but who didn't show
signs of being ill, including chicken cullers, relatives of known
cases and hospital staff who cared for H5N1 patients. "And they
essentially found zero. They haven't found any," says Dr. Scott
Dowell, director of global disease detection and preparedness at the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
Many of the studies that looked at blood samples from several
thousand volunteers in total haven't yet been published, though
findings have been presented at scientific conferences. Most of the
published studies looking for antibody evidence of H5N1 infection
date back to the 1st H5N1 outbreak, in Hong Kong in 1997, where the
virus claimed the lives of 6 of 18 cases. Those studies showed
limited asymptomatic infection in high-risk groups. "The (more
recent) studies that have been done, one of the reasons, frankly,
that I think they haven't been followed up on is they haven't found
many positives. You don't get too excited about all negative
serology," Perdue explains. Still, WHO knows it is crucial to get a
better idea of whether the known H5N1 cases are the tip of an
iceberg, or the iceberg itself. With that end in mind, the
organization is developing an H5N1 clinical trials network that will
try to answer this and other pressing questions.

[These reports highlight the difficulties in establishing reliable
test regimes for identifying positive cases of H5N1 virus infection
in countries with limited technical resources and the continuing
absence of hard data on the seroprevalence of human H5N1 virus
infection in endemic/enzootic areas. Reliable surveillance is also
affected by administrative boundaries (e.g. eastern Turkey and
northern Iraq) that do not correspond to geographic and ethnic
realities. - Mod.CP]
