At a glance: the latest HPAI outbreaks for the period 1-30 Apr 2011
-------------------------------------------------------------------
[Based on reports of confirmed HPAI cases using the following
sources: OIE, European Commission, FAO, and national governments].

holdings were either not vaccinated or vaccination history unknown
while both of the commercial farms had been vaccinated.

Province. The outbreak was found by routine surveillance. Farms tested
positive for serology but initially had no clinical signs. Initial PCR
test and virus isolation were negative. Follow-up PCR test could only
confirm diagnosis. Later a farm with 5,754 ostrich had clinical signs
and 100 ostriches died.

[On Wed 20 Apr 2011, "The Jakarta Post" published a report titled
"Avian flu outbreak hits Klungkung after religious ritual"; see
http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/20/avian-flu-outbreak-hits-klungkung-after-religious-ritual.html.

The report, forwarded to us by Merritt Clifton, included information
on "a number of people and chickens (which) were found to have been
infected with avian flu soon after a big ceremony last week [week of
11 Apr 2011]" and cited an official who reportedly said, "We [the
office staff] have monitored how, during rituals, people need more
poultry for various offerings and consumption. Contact with the
animals was open when they processed the chickens, the best time for
getting the virus that causes bird flu."

Merritt Clifton assumed that the "ceremony" included cockfighting,
and added his following comment: "Until and unless Bali in specific
and Indonesia in general addresses the cockfighting vector at least as
effectively as Thailand and China already have, they are never going
to stop H5N1 transmission."

We have not seen, so far, official confirmation of the media report
above on AI cases in birds and humans in Klungkung (Bali). If
confirmed, it may be expected to be included in the next issue of
FAOAIDEnews. - Mod.AS]
