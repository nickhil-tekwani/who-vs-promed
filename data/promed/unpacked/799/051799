Kunene: Measles cases top one thousand
--------------------------------------
5 months after the 1st case of measles was reported in the Kunene
Region [see ProMED archive listed below], the number of affected
patients has risen to 1081, the Regional Health Directorate told Nampa
[Namibia Press Agency] on Wednesday [13 Jan 2010].

Peter de Villiers, Mayor of Opuwo, told The Namibian that 33 patients
are presently in treatment for measles at the measles treatment
centre, which was set up at the Opuwo State Hospital in response to
the health crisis towards the end of 2009. The number of patients has
significantly dropped from previous months, when the centre treated as
many as 50 to 70 patients at one time, De Villiers said. "New cases
are still coming, but at slower rates," De Villiers added, confirming
that the rate of infection appears to be slowing down.

A house-to-house information campaign aimed at creating awareness and
providing information of the disease among Opuwo residents and in the
surrounding areas was postponed on Thu [14 jan 2010] because the
health authorities don't have enough cars. The health authorities have
also begun to address hostels in the area, in an effort to inform
school children about measles.

Epidemiologist Puumue Katjiuanjo told Nampa that only 5 percent of the
vaccination coverage reached the Epupa Clinic in 2009, increasing
vulnerability to infection amongst children. He added that people in
the region were not protected against measles and were unprepared to
deal with the disease when it first raised its head last year [2009].

The Opuwo State Hospital offers the only treatment centre in the
Kunene region, and patients are referred to the hospital from the
region's clinics and remote villages and settlements, De Villiers
said, explaining that the 33 patients currently receiving care are not
limited to locals from Opuwo.

At least 625 patients with measles have been admitted to the Opuwo
State Hospital treatment centre since the outbreak of measles in
September last year [2009], Nampa reported. The number of fatalities
has increased to 13, the health authorities confirmed to Nampa this
week. An Angolan national is suspected to have been the 1st sufferer,
treated at Epupa clinic last year.

Several attempts made by The Namibian to obtain additional information
from the Ministry of Health in Windhoek and Opuwo proved unsuccessful,
as key staff were on leave or attending meetings elsewhere.

[Previously Namibia has had a good record in the implementation of
measles vaccination but the current large outbreak, possibly
introduced from neighboring Angola, has revealed deficiencies in
vaccination coverage (apparently due to shortage of vaccine). As a
consequence, a large outbreak has developed with an increasing number
of fatalities, urgently requiring reinvigoration of the measles
vaccination programme.

The Kunene region, one of 13 regions of Namibia, is relatively
underdeveloped in comparison with the rest of the country. The region
takes its name from the Kunene River which forms the northern border
with Angola.
