A severe outbreak of melon yellow mosaic disease caused by Zucchini yellow
mosaic virus in the Punjab province of Pakistan.
A.H. Malik, S. Mansoor <smansoor@nibge.org>, S. Iram, R.W. Briddon and Y.
Zafar, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Jhang
Road, Faisalabad, Pakistan. Accepted for publication 3 May 2005.
In 2003 a serious disease of muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_) appeared in commercial
fields in the Punjab, Pakistan. Symptoms of the disease were
characteristically chlorosis, leaf curling and deformation, vein clearing and
the formation of leaf-like outgrowths on the upper leaf surface of some
leaves. The disease led to almost 100 percent loss of the crop in some areas
and was present again in 2004, with a similar phenotype and losses.
To identify the virus(es) associated with the disease, infected plant samples
were collected from several locations in Punjab Province. On the basis of
symptoms and host, cucurbit-infecting viruses were suspected. Samples were
screened for the presence of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV), and Cucumber
mosaic virus (CMV) by DAS-ELISA using virus specific polyclonal antisera
(Loewe, Germany). All symptomatic samples collected from the epidemic area
were shown by DAS-ELISA to be infected with ZYMV.
For samples collected in the Punjab, CMV was detected at a low incidence in
tomato plants expressing symptoms of yellow chlorosis growing near melon
fields, but not in melon. Healthy indicator plants (melon, cucumber and
_Nicotiana benthamiana_) [Nb] were mechanically inoculated with sap extracted
from symptomatic melon leaves by leaf abrasion. The virus was mechanically
transmitted from infected samples to healthy melon seedlings, induced symptoms
including leaf-like outgrowths on the upper leaf surface; typical of ZYMV
infection.
No infection was observed in Nb, which is a diagnostic host for Watermelon
mosaic virus, a common cucurbit potyvirus. This confirms that ZYMV is the
causative agent of the melon disease.
Although ZYMV has been reported from Pakistan on some cucurbits, with an
incidence of about 15 percent on samples collected from North West Frontier
Province, we could not find a report of the virus infecting melons. Moreover,
the enation [outgrowth]-like phenotype was observed for the 1st time and on a
large scale in Pakistan, although this phenotype is known to be caused by ZYMV
in other parts of the world. We are currently investigating ZYMV-encoded genes
causing this phenotype.

[ZYMV, first identified in Europe in 1981, has since been reported from most
southern and southwestern states in the US as well as and has been found in
France, the USA, Lebanon, Japan, Taiwan, Jordan, Singapore, Greece, Nepal and
likely in other counties. It is one of the major members in the Potyvirus
genus (_Potyviridae_ family) infecting cucurbits. It induces extreme symptoms
on all melon types, including severe yellow mosaic on leaves, which is usually
associated with distortion, deformation and fruit blistering. Plants are often
stunted and fruit set is poor. The first few leaves affected on rockmelons may
progress from chlorosis to full necrosis. A number of ZYMV variants have been
described, some strains of which may induce lethal wilting, others can cause
cracks on fruits or mosaic and hardening of the fruit flesh.
The virus has characteristics very similar to WMV-1 (Watermelon mosaic
potyvirus) and Watermelon virus 2 (nonpersistent aphid transmission, etc.),
and like WMV-2, its host range is not limited to cucurbits. Currently, none of
the genetic factors that confer resistance to WMV-1 or WMV-2 are able to
control ZYMV, but other resistance sources have been identified.
