New figures show a dramatic rise in the number of people in Inverclyde being diagnosed with a potentially fatal disease.

Statistics released to the Tele under Freedom of Information laws reveal a startling 60 percent rise in the number of cases of hepatitis C in the area between 2012 and 2013. The biggest rise was in the 55-64 age group, with 13 people diagnosed in 2013 compared to just 2 in 2012.

The disease, which can increase the risk of cancer if untreated and can also lead to liver failure, was also prevalent in the 65 and over age category -- with 14 people diagnosed in 2013 compared to just 3 in 2012.

Meanwhile, in the 1st 3 months of 2014, 37 people were diagnosed with the condition -- including 2 people under the age of 16.

A spokeswoman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says more cases are being diagnosed due to an increased awareness amongst health experts. She said: "NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde have been implementing the national hepatitis C action plan since this was introduced by the Scottish Government in 2006. The aims are to reduce the number of undiagnosed infections and increase the number of people cured of hepatitis C through treatment. Improved awareness of hepatitis C among the public and healthcare professionals has led to an increase in the number of people being tested for this blood-borne virus, especially at addiction services and GPs."

The spokeswoman also said that high-tech testing methods could be another reason for the rise in the number of people being diagnosed in GP practices and addiction services in the area. She said: "We have introduced new and improved methods of testing for hepatitis C, such as finger-prick tests, which make the process more accessible for staff and patients. As a result, people who have been at risk of infection are more likely to accept the offer of a test or indeed request one."

The latest NHS statistics also reveal that there has been a 21 percent rise of hepatitis C cases in people aged between 45 and 54, with 23 cases in 2012 compared to 28 in 2013 -- while there has been a 40 percent rise in cases affecting the 35-44 age group. A total of 40 people aged between 25-34 were diagnosed in 2013 while in the 16-24 age group, 5 people had the disease.

[It is likely that much of the increase in cases is related to a more aggressive screening program rather than a large increase in spread. Most, and perhaps all, of hepatitis C cases found are not acute cases but rather part of the about 85-90 percent of cases that are chronically infected.

Inverclyde (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverclyde) is one of 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland. Together with the East Renfrewshire and Renfrewshire council areas, Inverclyde forms part of the historic county of Renfrewshire, located in the west central Lowlands. It borders the North Ayrshire and Renfrewshire council areas, and is otherwise surrounded by the Firth of Clyde. A map of Scotland (still part of the UK) showing the location can be found at http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverclyde#/image/File:Inverclyde_in_Scotland.svg. - Mod.LL

In contrast, recent reports in the USA have shown a major increase in hepatitis C rates in younger injecting drug users. - Mod.LM]
