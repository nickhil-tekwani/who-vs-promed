Sixty specialists from the International Rice Research Institute
(IRRI), Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, South Korea, and Viet
Nam met to discuss how best to manage pest infestation and viruses
that have affected rice crops in Viet Nam. During the workshop, the
deputy minister for Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), Dr Bui
Ba Bong, said brown planthoppers infested the winter-spring crop of
2005-2006 in the Mekong Delta, leaving plants stunted, twisted, and
with no grains. During last year's [2007] summer-autumn crop, some
400 hectares (988 acres) of rice fields in the Mekong provinces of
Long An and Dong Thap were affected. Bong said the disease lowered
the Mekong Delta's rice production by some 700 000 tonnes in 2006.

In response to Viet Nam's request, in May 2006 the Australian Centre
for International Agricultural Research [ACIAR] funded a project that
would help farmers overcome this crippling problem in a sustainable
manner. Bong urged international scientists to help Viet Nam to
develop a research plan and strategy that would not rely on
pesticides and would be sustainable. "We need to ensure that Viet Nam
will continue to enjoy high rice productivity with no damage to the
environment," he said.

Dr IL Choi, a virologist from IRRI, said the pests and diseases could
spread very rapidly and the virus[es] had been found far north of
Hanoi. Prof MM Escalada, a communications scientist from the
Philippines, said: "Rapid communication through use of multimedia
will be useful. Viet Nam has shown to have high capacity in doing
this efficiently." The director general of the MARD's Plant
Protection Department, Nguyen Quang Minh, said the department would
intensify vigilance through improved monitoring, and increase
awareness and training campaigns to assist farmers in the coming
seasons to combat the diseases.

[Epidemics of planthoppers and leafhoppers infesting rice crops and
spreading virus diseases were reported from this area recently.
Specifically, the Asian brown planthopper (_Nilaparvata lugens_) was
reported to have reached very high numbers. It is one of the worst
pests of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region and is
also the vector of _Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus
_Tenuivirus_) and _Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus
_Oryzavirus_). Symptoms of both of these were observed associated
with the planthopper epidemic. A number of other rice viruses spread
by the green rice leafhopper (_Nephotettix virescens_) including
_Rice yellow stunt virus_, _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_ and _Rice
tungro spherical virus_ are also present in southern Viet Nam. Other
viruses such as _Rice stripe virus_, _Rice dwarf virus_ and _Rice
hoja blanca virus_ are spread by different species of plant- or
leafhoppers. In tropical regions, levels of virus infection and
vector density may be very high. Crop losses of up to 100 percent due
to some virus diseases (for example tungro) have been reported.

Several of the insect-transmitted rice viruses are transmitted by
their vectors in a persistent (vector infectious for life) or
semi-persistent manner and can therefore be spread over long
distances by infectious insects transported on air currents or by
people movements. Generally for these pathogens, disease management
includes vector control, cultural practices to minimise inoculum, and
the use of rice varieties resistant to the vector, the virus, or
both. Cultivars resistant to the vectors have usually low virus
disease incidence.

At least 15 viruses are known to affect rice, and many of these occur
in Asia. Virus disease problems seem to have been accentuated
worldwide by the introduction of modern agricultural techniques,
double cropping and high yielding rice cultivars. The pathogens may
have been present, but rarely reached epidemic proportions under
traditional cropping systems when average rice yield was low.
