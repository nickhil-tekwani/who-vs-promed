An outbreak of koi herpesvirus (KHV) has been confirmed at Tockenham Reservoir near Lyneham.

The illness has no implications for humans but can have a devastating effect on the mortality rates of fish.

There has recently been an outbreak across the country so to try to prevent it spreading further the movement of fish to and from the reservoir has been restricted.

Fishery equipment, disinfection, and movement control measures are also now in place and anglers must ensure that they comply with all biosecurity measures within the designated area.

KHV is a serious viral infection which can affect all varieties of carp, including ornamental breeds.

Clinical signs of KHV disease may include white or necrotic patches on the gills, rough patches on the skin, sloughing mucous, and sunken eyes. These signs usually appear when water temperatures are between 16 and 28 deg C [60.8-82.4 deg F]

Anyone noting deaths in carp or carp hybrids, with signs of disease similar to those above, or have suspicion of notifiable disease in any aquatic animal, should immediately contact the Fish Health Inspectorate.

Anyone who imports, keeps, fishes for, or retails carp and carp hybrids should take precautions to prevent the spread of KHV.

[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) has been reported throughout the world. The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. As other herpesviruses, KHD has the capacity to remain latent in the infected fish and become activated and cause disease when some stressors trigger it. More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2014 update), which is available at http://www.oie.int/en/international-standard-setting/aquatic-manual/access-online/.
