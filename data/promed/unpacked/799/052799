Mongolia Seals Area of Suspected Foot-and-Mouth
--------------------------------------------
ULAN BATOR - Mongolia has virtually sealed off large parts of 2 eastern
provinces to prevent the spread of a suspected outbreak of Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMD), officials said.
More than 500 animals have died of what appeared to be the highly
contagious disease which affects cloven-footed animals, and another 600
appeared to be suffering from it, they said.
Laboratory tests in Russia to confirm an outbreak have not yet been
completed but urgent measures are being taken to prevent any outbreak from
spreading, the officials said.
Large parts of the eastern provinces of Dornod and Sukhbaatar provinces
have been sealed off to outsiders, they said.
Hundreds of animals died in May 2000 in the province of Eastern Gobi in an
outbreak of the disease.
