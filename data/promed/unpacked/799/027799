In St Martin, 2 cases of chikungunya [virus infection], a dengue-like sickness, have been confirmed following testing at the specialist laboratory in Marseille that returned positive results to Agence Regional de Sante (ARS [Regional Health Agency]) on 5 Dec 2013.

The disclosure was made by ARS Director-General Patrice Richard on Friday [6 Dec 2013] at a press conference in the Prefecture attended by Prefet Philippe Chopin, President of the Collectivity Aline Hanson, Dutch-side [St Maarten] Minister of Public Health Cornelius de Weever and specialist epidemiologists.

Richard said family doctors, for about 2 weeks, have been reporting cases of people showing suspected signs of chikungunya, and not dengue [virus infections]. There is no current evidence that chikungunya is on the Dutch side [of the island]. The virus can be imported by travelling from a risk country.

The 2 confirmed cases originated in French Quarter. In addition, there are currently 4 "probable" cases and 30 "suspected" cases, 15 of which are in the Oyster Pond area. In technical terms, "suspected" means just the signs are manifested while "probable" is a diagnostic test that calculates the likelihood that chikungunya [virus] has been contracted, according to epidemiologists.

ARS is awaiting more results of other cases from the Marseille laboratory.

"Chikungunya is in the Pacific islands, in Asia, in India, but never until now in the Caribbean islands," noted epidemiologist Marion Petit-Sinturel. "It's the 1st time we have located transmission here in St Martin."

ARS Director Pascal Godefroy said the situation is likely to change quickly as results come in. "This could be the beginning of an epidemic since we are already in a dengue epidemic," he said.

Minister de Weever acknowledged that "mosquitoes don't stop at the border," and assured the full cooperation of Dutch-side health authorities.

"We will be synchronising efforts on all fronts with our French-side colleagues, and following similar protocols, treatment plans, action plans, prevention control, and communication," De Weever said. "I believe that only together can we fight this war and what may come in the future, but the ground work has been done today and we look forward to working together."

President Hanson called for the population to be extra vigilant in eradicating breeding grounds, and reminded that the cemetery in Marigot is an area where water collects in some areas.

Prefet Chopin indicated there was no cause for alarm as the method for controlling the spread of chikungunya is the same for dengue. The emergence of the virus has prompted an immediate and comprehensive plan of action by French-side authorities to limit the impact of the disease and fight against the mosquito vector.

The plan includes strengthening epidemiological surveillance by the systematic identification of cases and their location, control of larvae and intensification of mosquito fogging, strengthening health checks at the border by the handling of aircrafts and providing information to travellers, the establishment of a public communication campaign to recall prevention, and protection measures.

Chikungunya is a [virus] disease transmitted by the same mosquito that [transmits] dengue, _Aedes aegypti_. Symptoms are similar to dengue -- a sudden fever of 38.5 deg C (101.3 deg F) or higher, joint pain in wrists, ankles or knuckles, muscle pain, extreme tiredness, headache, rash, itching, particularly at the arc of the foot, and sometimes, minor bleeding in the gums, especially in children.

The disease appears between 4-7 days after the bite of the infected mosquito. The majority of clinical signs last 5-10 days, but joint pain may persist longer. Severe cases requiring hospitalisation are rare.

Instructions for prevention and protection are identical to those implemented against dengue, namely, destroying potential mosquito breeding grounds indoors and outdoors, throwing out stagnant water from flower vases, old tyres, or any other receptacles, and cleaning out rain gutters.

Protect yourself from mosquito bites by wearing long-sleeve clothing or long pants, and use insect repellents liberally, or use mosquito nets at night.

[The occurrence of a chikungunya epidemic in the Caribbean area is of concern, but perhaps not surprising. The tropical Americas, including Caribbean Islands, harbor abundant populations of the chikungunya virus mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_.

This virus has been introduced in various areas of the world by viremic travelers into localities where the vector is present, with initiation of ongoing transmission. It seems that it has just been a matter of time until an outbreak occurs in the Americas.

The French and Dutch health authorities on St Martin are to be commended for quickly mounting a coordinated effort that includes both French and Dutch sides of the island. One hopes that their efforts for vector control and surveillance are successful and bring the relatively small outbreak to a halt, without further spread on the island or to other areas in the Caribbean.
