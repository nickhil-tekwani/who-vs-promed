The Ministry of Health is urging local governments to boost
preventive measures against scarlet fever and measles due to a 40
percent increase in the number of cases of scarlet fever compared to
last year [200], according to Deputy Minister of Health Trinh Quan
Huan.

There have been 23 000 cases reported so far this year [2009], with
the number of cases in some southern provinces, including Dong Nai
and Kien Giang, as well as in the city of Can Tho, as much as 100-300
percent higher than last year. "Pediatrics Hospital No 1 receives 30
new cases of scarlet fever per day," said Dr Truong Huu Khanh.

Dr. Luong My Binh of Central Pediatrics Hospital warned that August
or September could bring an epidemic of scarlet fever, and urged
people to actively protect themselves by sleeping with mosquito nets
and clearing their surrounding environment. Those with high fever for
more than 2 days should be taken to hospital for treatment, the
doctor said.

The number of measles patients was also increasing, with 25 cases
admitted to the hospital per day, with the hot weather weakening many
sufferers, said Khanh.

The Ministry of Health has asked local authorities to draw up plans
for spraying chemicals against mosquitoes and disinfecting
disease-prone areas, directing them to allocate 30 percent of their
local public health budgets to preventive measures against measles
and scarlet fever. Those local authorities which failed to take these
measures would be penalised, said Huan.

[Scarlet fever is an infection caused by strains of group A
beta-hemolytic streptococci (GAS) that produce erythrogenic toxin.
Although usually associated with pharyngeal infection, scarlet fever
can also follow GAS infection of the skin, like impetigo, surgical
wounds, or uterus. Whereas GAS pharyngitis is transmitted by airborne
respiratory particles usually in the colder winter months from
infected patients and asymptomatic carriers, GAS skin infections are
more common in warm tropical and subtropical climates with high
humidity and are often associated with poor personal hygiene,
overcrowding that would be expected to facilitate person to person
contact, and minor skin trauma, such as insect bites. Perhaps this is
the reason for public health efforts in Viet Nam directed against
mosquitoes. However, measles is highly contagious and is definitely
spread by airborne respiratory particles expelled by infected
patients, especially when cough and coryza are maximal. Prevention of
measles is best done by routine administration of live attenuated
measles vaccine in childhood.
