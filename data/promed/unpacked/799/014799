EBOLA - GABON: CESSATION OF OUTBREAK (02)
=========================================
Date: Tue, 04 Mar 1997 15:03:45 -0500
From: Randy Bethke <bethke@ncifcrf.gov>
[see
Ebola - Gabon: cessation of outbreak 970303162014]
I agree [that we "now await the next appearance of an Ebola virus"]. With
improved surveillance, serodiagnosis, awareness, and communication, I believe
it is simply a matter of a (relatively) short time before there is another
documented outbreak.

[Of course, the virus is necessary as well. Must be lurking somewhere. --
