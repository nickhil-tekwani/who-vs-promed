The World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) has prepared an advisory document offering guidance and a series of Frequently Asked Questions to help its members when talking with pet owners concerned about the risk of infection with the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), following the outbreak in China.

It also calls on veterinarians to urge owners not to panic because it is highly unlikely that they could contract 2019-nCoV from their dog or cat, or that their companion animal could transmit the virus to people or other animals.

Dr Michael Lappin, chair of the WSAVA's One Health Committee, recommends that veterinarians tell owners to:
1. keep their companion animals with them if they are self-quarantined,
2. keep cats inside,
3. arrange care for any animals left at home if family or friends are hospitalised,
4. contact their veterinarian immediately if they have questions or concerns.

The WSAVA's Scientific Committee and One Health Committee have worked together to produce the advisory document, which confirms that there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with 2019-nCoV or that they may be a source of infection to people. They do warn, though, that it is a "rapidly evolving situation."

The advisory also cautions veterinarians against using vaccines against canine enteric coronavirus available in some global markets in the hope that they may offer some cross-protection against 2019-nCoV. There is no evidence for this, as the new virus is a distinctly different coronavirus variant.

WSAVA President Dr Shane Ryan said: "There is still much we don't know about 2019-CoV and, while the priority is to bring the outbreak of the infection caused to people under control as soon as possible; we are concerned for animal welfare with reports of animals being abandoned or killed because their owners fear that they might carry the virus. There is no evidence that this is necessary, and we urge our members to ensure owners follow our guidance and keep themselves and their companion animals safe."

The WSAVA's advisory is available here: https://wsava.org/wpcontent/uploads/2020/02/nCOV_WSAVA-Advisory-Document-final-05.02.2020.pdf.

The WSAVA represents more than 200 000 veterinarians worldwide through its 113 member associations. Its core activities include the development of WSAVA Global Guidelines in key areas of veterinary practice, including pain management, nutrition and vaccination, and the provision of continuing education.

WSAVA Scientific and One Health Committees Advisory Document: "The New Coronavirus and Companion Animals - Advice for WSAVA Members" (final version, 9 Feb 2020)
---------------------------------------
[The document includes a brief description of the event as known at the time of its finalization. In response to the described outbreak, the WSAVA Scientific and One Health Committees have prepared the following list of frequently asked questions for the WSAVA membership with the help of Prof. Scott Weese from the University of Guelph, Canada, "while being aware of issues related to pet abandonment in China and hope that this information will be of use to veterinarians in dealing with the concerns of their clients"].

1. How can I help protect myself and my clinic staff?

- Visit the 2019-nCoV Prevention and Treatment page to learn about how to protect yourself from respiratory illnesses, like 2019-nCoV. [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/prevention-treatment.html].

2. Can 2019-nCoV infect domestic animals?

- Currently, there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus. Additionally, there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals might be a source of infection to people with the new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation, and information will be updated as it becomes available.

3. Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick?

- Do not handle pets or other animals while sick. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with 2019-nCoV, several types of coronaviruses can cause illness in animals and spread between animals and people. Until we know more, avoid contact with animals and wear a facemask if you must be around animals or care for a pet in order to protect the pet from the possibility of disease transmission.

4. What should I do if my pet or other animal becomes ill and was around a person with novel coronavirus?

- If your pet or other animal becomes ill, call your veterinarian to let them know that you are bringing a sick pet that was exposed to a person with the new coronavirus. Do not take the animal to a veterinary clinic until you have had a discussion with clinic staff. Tell them about any contact the animal may have had with someone with 2019-nCoV infection.

5. If my pet or other animal has been in contact with someone who is sick, can they spread the disease to other people?

- We do not yet know whether animals can get infected. We also do not know whether they could get sick from this new coronavirus. Currently, there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus. Additionally, there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals might be a source of infection to people with the new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.

6. What are the concerns regarding pets that have been in contact with people infected with this virus?

- While this virus seems to have emerged from an animal source, it is now spreading from person-to-person. Person-to-person spread is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. At this time, it's unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people. Importantly, there is no data to date that dogs and cats can become infected with 2019-nCoV.

7. What should be done with animals in areas where the virus is active?

- Currently there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with 2019-nCoV, several types of coronaviruses can cause illness in animals and spread between animals and people. Until we know more, avoid contact with animals and wear a facemask if you must be around animals or care for a pet. However, people diagnosed with 2019-nCoV should stay away from pets to help protect the pet from the potential for disease spread.

8. Should veterinarians start to vaccinate dogs against canine coronavirus because of the risk of 2019-nCoV?

- The canine coronavirus vaccines available in some global markets are intended to protect against enteric coronavirus infection and are NOT licensed for protection against respiratory infections.

Veterinarians should NOT use such vaccines in the face of the current outbreak thinking that vaccinating dogs with the commercially-available vaccines will provide cross-protection against the infection by the 2019-nCoV, since the enteric and respiratory viruses are distinctly different variants of coronavirus. No vaccines are currently available in any market for respiratory coronavirus infection in the dog.

[The advisory document, issued by WSAVA when the disease was still coined "New Coronavirus" and 2019-nCoV, presents a commendable, timely effort to protect the clinicians and their patients. It is characterised by many unknowns: ("there is no evidence," "currently there is no evidence," "until we know more," and the like), while warning that the epidemic is a "rapidly evolving situation."

By now, while the numbers of human infections and deaths have more than quadrupled, some evidence should already have become available to inform whether pets in close association with COVID-19 infected owners have become infected and/or pose any public health hazard. Such tests are required as soon as possible, for the sake of human AND animal health. This information should be obtained without necessarily requiring experimental infection trials. Sampling could be assisted by small animal practitioners, particularly in China. Even preliminary results deserve early publication, allowing an update of the WSAVA advisory COVID-19 document. - Mod.AS
