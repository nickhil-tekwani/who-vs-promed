Rio de Janeiro's sanitary control superintendent became the 2nd fatal
victim of what doctors suspect is tick-borne spotted fever after
apparently contracting the disease in a mountain resort. Doctors
said the 41-year-old died after spending 13 days in intensive care.

Last Thu, 27 Oct 2005, another man died with similar symptoms. A
62-year-old man is in hospital, also with suspected spotted fever.

All of them had been staying in a small hotel in Itaipava, a popular
mountain resort next to Rio, where they apparently had been bitten by
ticks carrying spotted fever. Epidemiologists found infected ticks in
the forest near the hotel.

Spotted fever is curable if diagnosed and treated with antibiotics
within a week after infection. As time passes, the greater the risks
of death from the disease, which affects blood vessel walls. Rash on
the patient's skin is one of the key symptoms.

[This is also known as Brazilian spotted fever or, in Portuguese,
febre maculosa brasileira. It is quite similar to Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, with only subtle differences. The etiological agent,
_Rickettsia ricketsii_, is considered almost identical to its
American counterpart.

It was first described in 1929 but underwent a still-unexplained
disappearance in the 1960s and 1970s. Since 1985 it has been found
with increasing frequency in Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais, but cases
have been seen in Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo, also in the
Brazilian southeast. Recently cases have been identified in the state
of Santa Catarina in the south. The main vector tick is _Amblyomma
cajennense_, but _A. cooperii_ has been also implicated. - Mod.LL]
