ISRAEL: Cattle lock-down with foot-&-mouth fears
------------------------------------------------
Israeli Veterinary Services at the Ministry of Agriculture have
banned the transport of livestock between Israel, Gaza and the West
Bank following an outbreak of foot-&-mouth disease [FMD] among the
10 000 calves that were imported from Australia.
The infected cattle are under quarantine in special transit stations
in the Arava desert in Israel.
Israeli livestock that have been immunized twice against the disease
are exempt from the ban. The veterinary services have taken very
strict measures to prevent any further spread of the disease in view
of the fact that it was recently diagnosed in the Judean Desert,
south of Beth Lehem, and in Egypt.

[According to the above and previous reports, 3 foci of suspected FMD
infection seem to have been discovered: in the 2 import/transit
quarantine stations at Eilot and Zofar, (respectively 5 and 130 km
north of Eilat
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?
action=showmap&country=183_9005_5&language=1>),
where the imported calves are maintained, and, probably, "in the
Judean Desert, south of Beth Lehem" (West Bank; map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?
action=showmap&country=183_0_4&language=1>).
The daily Maariv reports, on 22 Feb 2006 noon, about cattle mortality
in the Gaza strip (Palestinian authority), suspected as being due to
FMD; samples were, reportedly, collected in order to be sent to the
Israeli veterinary Services for diagnosis.

Official confirmation (or otherwise), including the identity of the
FMD serotype involved, is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
