The People's Republic of China notifies officially to the OIE an
outbreak of _Streptococcus suis_ in pigs, including laboratory
investigation research in animals
-----------------------------------------------
Recent information of a disease in pigs affecting humans occurring in
the Sichuan province in the People's Republic of China has been
circulating. The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) requested
the OIE Delegate to the People's Republic of China to provide
detailed information about the nature of the disease in animals. The
Delegate today [5 Aug 2005] officially provided the OIE with the
investigation results carried out by the Veterinary Services in the
affected animals.
According to the report, the date of the 1st confirmation of the
disease was 25 Jul 2005. It is confirmed that the outbreak occurred
1st in pigs in the Sichuan Province in 8 backyard farms.
The National Animal Exotic Center and the Harbin Veterinary Research
Institute of the People's Republic of China did the differential
diagnosis and excluded Avian Influenza virus and Nipah virus.
As immediate control measures, stamping out, quarantine, screening,
movement control inside the country and zoning were undertaken. The
use of vaccination may be considered to be further undertaken.
The OIE is in close contact with the Veterinary Authorities of the
People's Republic of China and will continue to monitor the situation
very closely.

[By providing the said information, the Chinese authorities act in
line with article 1.1.2.3 of OIE's (revised) Terrestrial Animal
Health Code. According to said article, Veterinary Administrations
shall send to the Central Bureau notification (within 24 hours) of
any one of 6 mentioned animal-health events, including "an emerging
disease with significant morbidity or mortality, or zoonotic
potential."
The Code definition of "emerging disease" is: "a new infection
resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic
agent, a known infection spreading to a new geographic area or
population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease
diagnosed for the 1st time and which has a significant impact on
animal or public health." The said definition is included in the
updated text of the Code. In a separate press release, the OIE states
that, as of 5 Aug 2005, the full new edition 2005 of the Terrestrial
Code is available on line in its English version
<http://www.oie.int/eng/press/en_050805a.htm>.
Several aspects of the current outbreak still remain unanswered. What
are the morbidity and mortality rates in pigs? Is there any
differential age susceptibility? What are the pathological and
histopathological changes? Are there any performed/envisaged
virological investigations besides excluding influenza and Nipah?
Have there been any experimental infection trials in animals? All
these unanswered questions cloud the perception of transparency in
disease reporting. At this point, might it not be useful to have an
international presence on outbreak swine farms so that some of these
questions can be answered sooner rather than later?
Applying "stamping out" is an unusually severe measure when related
to a bacterium which -- at least, according to existing knowledge --
is rather endemic in many countries in piggeries. It would be helpful
to note how screening is to be applied, and what criteria will be
used for farms to be "stamped out." - Mods.AS&PC]
