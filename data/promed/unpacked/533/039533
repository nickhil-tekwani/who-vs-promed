Malaria and typhoid have claimed 10 lives, while over 3000 people
were suffering from the diseases in Surguja district of Chhattisgarh,
a government officer said on Friday.
"Nearly 3000 tribal people in Ramchandrapur, Ramanujganj and
Wadrafnagar blocks in Surguja district have been in the grip of
malaria and typhoid. The region has reported 10 deaths during the
past 3 days," the district's acting collector Amir Ali said over
telephone.
"The situation is very serious. 50 doctors and 200 medical staff have
immediately rushed to the disease-hit areas from the district
headquarter of Ambikapur," Ali added. He said that the administration
was holding medical camps in malaria- and typhoid-hit areas in
Surguja district, 405 km west of here [where?], though the tribal
patients preferred to use traditional medicines.
"The death toll is likely to go up within next few days as the
patients are reluctant to use available medical facilities,' Ali
added

[The report mentions no specific symptoms, and it seems unlikely that
there should be an outbreak of malaria and Salmonella typhoid at the
same time. An outbreak of malaria would require a breakdown of vector
control or a sudden increase in vector density in the area. Malaria
in India is seasonal, and it is now very late in the season, which
makes malaria less likely. ProMED would be grateful for further
information on the illness. - Mod.EP]
