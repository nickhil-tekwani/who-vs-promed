In July 2013, PPQ [Plant Protection and Quarantine] confirmed the 1st US detection of _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV) in a melon seed field in Yolo County, California. Since the initial find, a plot in Sutter County has also tested positive for CGMMV. The virus occurs in certain areas of Europe and Asia.

PPQ is working to determine the size and scope of the infestation and the appropriate next steps. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and County officials have placed a hold on all of the confirmed fields and are working to identify equipment used in these fields.

PPQ has developed protocols for mitigation of risk from this virus, including sanitation protocols, and provides guidance for future farming operation in the infected areas.

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 per cent. The virus has a narrow host range limited to the Cucurbitaceae. Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. They may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines and internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, in water and contaminated soil. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices, and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops with resistance to CGMMV have been developed.

The detection of CGMMV in a melon field for seed production, as reported above, is particularly serious due to the potential for spreading the virus with commercial seed. It would be important to identify the source and route of entry into the country to prevent further incursions.
