The head of the District Health Office (DKK) Sukoharjo, Dr Guntur Subiyantoro, asks city residents to be wary of mosquitoes from other areas or urbanizations due to an outbreak of chikungunya disease in 2 villages bordering the Klaten [regency].

According to DKK data there are 41 patients with diseases caused [transmitted] by mosquitoes. That number includes 25 Ngemplak villagers and 16 Pucangan villagers, both areas in the Kartasura, Sukoharjo district. On Wed 17 Oct 2012, the official stated that, "people suspected of having chikungunya [virus infections] in both villages were located in the region bordering Klaten."

Furthermore, Guntur said the allegations were based on routine community action in 2 villages where people were accustomed to fogging or fumigation. Meanwhile, the villagers still do not have these activities on the border. "A healthy lifestyle is practiced by citizens. Residents were routinely eradicating mosquito larvae."

In the meantime, Dr Guntur ordered that the public be aware of the spread of mosquito-borne chikungunya and dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) as the rainy season arrives. "If people want fogging please report that to DKK. Also drain the bathtub and discard the water in catchment areas."

Guntur explained, until now the Kartasura district has reported new chikungunya outbreaks. Information obtained indicates that [most] chikungunya patients were in Ngemplak village. In the village of Pucangan, children and adults were affected. The chikungunya outbreak happened early last month [September 2012] and the majority of patients have recovered.

According to DKK data, almost all areas in Sukoharjo are prone to chikungunya [virus infection]. Areas such as, Grogol subdistrict and Sukoharjo regency are densely populated and will become highly susceptible to mosquito [breeding] if they not take the appropriate measures for eradication of mosquito breeding sites.

[There is no indication that these reported chikungunya virus infections were laboratory confirmed or if any affected individuals are suffering persistent arthralgia, which is common in people following the acute phase of that disease.

There are periodic focal outbreaks of chikungunya virus infections in Indonesia, including Central Java (see archives below), so the current outbreaks in 2 Central Java villages reported above are not surprising. - Mod.TY
