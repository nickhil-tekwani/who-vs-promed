With the addition of the newest case of human H5N1 avian influenza in a woman from Sohag [Suhaj] governorate, this brings the total cases of the lethal zoonotic infection to 20 in Egypt, according to a Masrawy.com report (computer translated).

The report notes that a 42 year old woman from Sohag exhibited symptoms on 4 Dec 2014 and was admitted to hospital for treatment about one week later. She was diagnosed with double pneumonia and later recovered. The investigation into the case reveals the woman was exposed to backyard birds. The total number of cases of human H5N1 avian flu in 2014 in Egypt is now 20 cases (8 cases have recovered, 3 cases are currently under treatment and 9 have succumbed to the disease).

H5N1 is a type of influenza virus that causes a highly infectious, severe respiratory disease in birds called avian influenza or bird flu. Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 per cent, according to the World Health Organization [WHO]. According to WHO, the primary risk factor for human infection with the virus appears to be direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead poultry or contaminated environments. They go on to say there is no evidence to suggest that the H5N1 virus can be transmitted to humans through properly prepared poultry or eggs. A few human cases have been linked to consumption of dishes made of raw, contaminated poultry blood. However, slaughter, de-feathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings, are likely to be risk factors.

[All cases are associated with backyard propagation and consumption of domestically reared poultry.

Human cases of avian influenza H5N1 virus infection 1st appeared in 2003, affecting 16 countries in middle Asia and the Far East. Although there has been a gradual decline in the number of cases overall, Egypt and Indonesia still predominate.

There has been little evidence of direct transmission of H5N1 virus from person to person, and case numbers have correlated with the habit of rearing various species of poultry in homes and allotments. In Egypt, the positive cases have been widely distributed among the governorates. See the most recent WHO table of cumulative cases at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20141002CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf. An epidemiological curve of avian influenza A(H5N1) cases in humans by reporting country and month of onset produced by WHO summarises the available information and can be accessed at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/Influenza_Summary_IRA_HA_interface_04December2014.pdf. - Mod.CP
