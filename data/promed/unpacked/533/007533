Baby elephant dies in Calgary
-----------------------------
Malti, a 15 month old Asian elephant at the Calgary Zoo, started showing
flu-like symptoms early last week, and was given antiviral medication. A
diagnosis of endotheliotropic herpesvirus [EEHV], or elephant herpes, was
confirmed on Friday [31 Oct 2008]. The virus strikes suddenly and moves
swiftly, often killing young elephants within days.

Zookeepers were with the little pachyderm on Saturday afternoon [1 Nov
2008] when she died. "Shortly after 2 pm Malti awoke from a nap and
collapsed," said Sandie Black, one of the zoo's veterinarians who had been
working day and night to save her.

The zoo's 4 adult elephants spent time with the body. Malti's mother,
Maharani, who rejected a calf in 2004 that subsequently died of infection,
had developed a strong bond with this calf. "She was trying to get her to
stand up," said Laurie Herron, a zoo spokeswoman. "It was pretty emotional
for everybody."

Untreated, the virus attacks cells that line blood vessels in the heart,
liver, and other organs. The virus causes internal bleeding and heart
failure. Even if caught early, the prognosis for an infected elephant is
not good. Officials said only 4 elephants have recovered from the virus,
which has killed more than 40 animals in North America, Europe, and Asia.

A necropsy will be performed to determine exactly what caused Malti's
death. Since the virus is specific to elephants, veterinarians believe
Malti contracted it from one of the adults, which could be a carrier
without showing any symptoms. Tests are being conducted, but the virus
appears to pose minimal risk to adults.

"The terrible toll this virus has taken on these already endangered animals
is heartbreaking," Cathy Gaviller, the zoo's director of conservation,
research, and education said in a statement. "We can only hope we will
learn something from Malti's case that will benefit the research into this
disease to help save other elephants in the future."

The 1st case of the virus was identified in 1995 in a 16 month old Asian
elephant that died mysteriously at the National Zoo in Washington, DC.
Researchers examined the elephant's tissue and found they were dealing with
a previously unknown herpesvirus. They looked back at other baffling deaths
and detected the same condition. The virus was also identified in the wild
and among African elephants and later among wild Asian elephants.

Some animal-rights organizations have suggested the presence of the virus
in zoo populations as a reason elephants should not be held in captivity.
Yesterday [2 Nov 2008], the Calgary Zoo rejected that claim as have other
organizations. "Some extremist groups claim that EEHV is a disease of
captivity and are using the recent tragic deaths of elephant calves to
further their agenda to remove elephants from zoos, circuses, and other
professional animal organizations," the International Elephant Foundation,
a US-based non-profit conservation and research organization, which
receives funding from accredited zoos, has noted.

[There is significant diversity of herpesviruses within elephants, as
within most well investigated mammals. A recent study described an
additional 4 elephantid herpesviruses; see

This is indeed sad, and another disease that we don't know enough about to
prevent or adequately treat. - Mod.TG
