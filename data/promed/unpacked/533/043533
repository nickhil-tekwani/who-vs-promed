Blackleg robbing yields in canola crops
---------------------------------------
Blackleg disease is a major problem in canola crops on Lower Eyre
Peninsula, and so the Lower Eyre Agricultural Development Association
(LEADA) program this year [2008] aimed to gather data about the
incidence and severity of blackleg across the region.

A survey of canola paddocks was undertaken with 100 plants sampled
and scored for blackleg internal infection at the base of the stem in
each of 82 paddocks. Average blackleg internal infection scores in
individual paddocks ranged from less than 1 percent up to 38 percent.
But even at the highest levels of internal infection, no external
signs of blackleg, such as cankers and collapse of plants, were evident.

All varieties showed a wide range of internal infection levels. The
majority of canola varieties sampled had high levels of blackleg
disease resistance rating.

More than half the paddocks surveyed (44 of the 82 total) had average
internal infection levels of less than 10 percent, which is not
likely to have any effect on yield and oil content. But 12 paddocks
had average infection levels between 20 and 40 percent. Work by Dr
Steve Marcroft showed that plants with this level of internal
infection were about 7 percent lower yielding. Another study by Trent
Potter put the yield loss at about 14 percent.

It appears that yield loss with "hidden" blackleg infection is
significant in some paddocks therefore, and the impact of internal
infection on yield may well vary depending on the growing conditions.
Full survey results are still being collated.

[Blackleg (also called phoma stem canker) caused by the fungus
_Leptosphaeria maculans_ is the most serious disease of oilseed rape
with a possible yield loss of up to 50 percent or more. It can also
affect other _Brassica_ hosts such as cabbage and turnip. Symptoms on
rapeseed may include lesions on leaves, stems and pods, with stem
cankers leading to premature ripening or collapse of the crop.
However, symptomless infections may also occur, as described in the
report above.

The fungus is seed-borne and is also spread by wind, splash dispersal
and infected crop litter. It may overwinter in stubble which is
therefore often sprayed with fungicides. Disease management includes
use of clean seed, cultural practices to minimise inoculum,
fungicides, and planting of resistant cultivars. The pathogen is
extremely diverse with new strains evolving frequently some of which
have overcome major resistance genes within certain varieties in the
past. For more information see ProMED-mail post no. 20071203.3890 and

Canola is a group of rapeseed cultivars with modified oil components.
