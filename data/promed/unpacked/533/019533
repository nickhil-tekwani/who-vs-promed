Improperly handled powdered milk is being pointed at as the cause of the
illness that affected 40 inmates at the Ottawa County Fillmore Complex jail
on 17 May 2006.
Undersheriff Greg Steigenga said the powdered milk, which was being used
for the 1st time in the jail's cafeteria, was apparently not cooled down
quickly enough after it was mixed up with warm water, and that led to
bacteria growing in the milk.
Inmates started complaining of flu-like symptoms [presumably
gastrointestinal symptoms, the "stomach flu" - Mod.LL] that morning, and by
the next day, 40 of the jail's 350 inmates had become ill with the stomach
disorder, Steigenga said. Two of the inmates had to be taken to the North
Ottawa Community Hospital for treatment. They were returned to the jail the
same day. All 40 inmates affected were deemed healthy within the next few
days, according to Steigenga.
"From the beginning, we started looking at the milk as the possible cause
of the illness," Steigenga said. The jail had just started using powdered
milk instead of milk from a carton in an effort to save an estimated USD 10
000 annually on the cost of milk used for inmates.
According to Dr. Paul Heidel of the Ottawa County Health Department,
cafeteria workers used warm water to dissolve the milk powder and then put
the milk in the refrigerator to cool. The container apparently didn't allow
the milk to cool to a safe temperature quickly enough, which caused the
bacterial problem, he said.
"Once we started focusing on the powdered milk, we stopped using it and
went back to using regular milk from a carton," Steigenga said.
It took nearly 2 weeks for the results of the test to come back from a
state laboratory to confirm that the milk was the cause of the illness.
The incident was the 1st incident of a food-borne illness on record in the
jail, according to the Sheriff's Department. "We always have to try to find
ways to save money, but we certainly will not compromise the health and
safety of the inmates to do so," Steigenga said. If the jail does start
using the powdered milk again, it will be under much stricter handling
guidelines, he added.

[It is not clear whether the powdered milk itself, the water it was
reconstituted in, a food worker's hands, or the bowl was the original
source of the offending agent.
The etiology was apparently found by the State Lab. Two weeks seem like a
long time to implicate a bacterial cause unless staphylococcal enterotoxin
was implicated. Additionally, most bacterial food poisonings (except for
the toxin diseases caused by _S. aureus_ and _Bacillus cereus_) more likely
cause diarrhea. The presence or absence of significant fever in these cases
may also be a helpful diagnostic clue. Fever is not prominent in
staphylococcal food poisoning and might suggest a viral cause. ProMED would
like more information regarding the cause of the outbreak.
