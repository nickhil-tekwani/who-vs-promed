French authorities said Monday they had ordered the cleaning of 23 cooling
towers in two Paris districts after eight people were infected, one
fatally, by Legionnaires' disease, [which is caused by an airborne
bacterium.
In a statement, the prefect of the Ile de France, the region that includes
Paris and its suburbs, said the cooling towers were located in the northern
part of the 14th and 15th districts, in the southern part of the city.
"So far there is no sign to confirm that the source of exposure [to the
_Legionnella_ bacteria has disappeared," the statement said.
The eight cases were detected in August and September among people who
lived or worked in the 14th and 15th districts. One of the casualties was a
British citizen.
The bacterium breeds in sanitary installations, such as hot-water pipes or
air conditioning, and becomes airborne, mixed with fine water droplets, if
these systems leak. It is not transmitted from person to person.
The prefect said "self-cooling" towers were being targeted for
disinfection. These are towers that expel hot water from air-conditioning
systems as a cloud of fine spray.
Four people died in Paris in August 1998 in a previous outbreak of the
disease, prompting a similar cleanup in the second and ninth districts.
