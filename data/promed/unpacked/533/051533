Nearly 90 wildebeests and 15 gazelles [antelopes] have died in the wildlife corridor in Selela section of Monduli due to an outbreak of anthrax in the district. Monduli District [Arusha region] Commissioner Idd Kimanta has confirmed the epidemic, telling the Arusha regional Security Committee here that so far the number accounts for the carcasses that have been discovered, and it is believed that the damage is more severe.

"Chances are that more wildebeests could have been infected since the animals move around fast and in large groups; there is a need to check at the nearby game parks like Lake Manyara, Tarangire, and Ngorongoro," DC Kimanta said. He explained that samples of flesh from the dead animals were taken to the Chief Chemist, with the results confirming that the deaths were due to anthrax.

The District Livestock Officer, Mr Salum Omar, added that the disease has decimated domestic animals including cattle, sheep, and goats, with 60 of them already dead, bringing to 165 the total number of beasts lost to the anthrax outbreak.

"We are taking initiatives to vaccinate the remaining species of livestock against the disease, but people should take precautions not to eat meat from dead animals or even touch their carcasses," said Mr Omar.

Anthrax seems to be a strange phenomenon in the area: "This is the 1st ever anthrax outbreak in history, but even worse is the fact that the Maasai pastoralists, whose livestock have perished, are eating the dead animals, risking contracting the deadly disease," stated Selela Village Chairman Julius Loiboseki.

The Ward Councillor, Mr Cuthbert Meela said that the animals started dying late last week [week of 7 Nov 2016], noting that the infections could continue spreading unless the authorities act swiftly to prevent them.

[Anthrax is a disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. The disease occurs in both animals and humans worldwide, but it is primarily a disease of grazing or browsing mammals. In livestock, the disease is most commonly reported in cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, and horses, while it is rarer in pigs. Among wildlife, it is most commonly reported in zebra, greater and lesser kudu, waterbuck, roan antelope, wildebeest, springbok, buffalo, elephant, impala, oryx, giraffe, and hippopotamus.

Anthrax outbreaks involving wild animals have been reported previously in Tanzania (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02030.x/full and http://bushlink.org/wildvet/ANTHRAX%20info%20doc%202010.pdf)
where control measures are also indicated. The disease is endemic in livestock, with vaccination being reported (see ProMED-EAFR archive no. 20130731.347252). Also, in the current outbreak, it is reported that initiatives are underway to carry out vaccination. Risk of human infection is clearly a concern, although no human cases are mentioned. - Mod.NM

Overflow of wildlife anthrax into livestock in and around Arusha has been a major problem there, and elsewhere in Tanzania. The park boundaries are very porous and the local communities, in spite of warnings, will and do take their animals to graze within the park. It is therefore important for community and public health reasons to make sure that all livestock surrounding such parks be annually vaccinated against anthrax. - Mod.MHJ
