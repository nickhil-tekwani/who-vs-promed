A Biosecurity Queensland laboratory test has confirmed a case of lyssavirus in a bat found in the state's far north as health authorities report a surge in flying fox bites and scratches.

The ABC understands the little red flying fox was found in suburban Cairns and euthanised by a local wildlife carer who then sent the animal to Brisbane for testing.

Biosecurity Queensland principal veterinary officer Janine Barrett confirmed this was the 3rd infected bat discovered in 2020 following a single case of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) last year [2019].

"It's at the low end and the temptation is to think there's less of it around this year, but that's not really true," she said.

"The numbers, frankly, reflect far more about what people are doing -- whether they're out and about where bats are, whether they're finding bats that should be tested."

Dr. Barrett said the numbers of infections tended to fluctuate wildly, with as many as 20 cases detected in years when awareness campaigns were heavily promoted.

ABLV infection in humans causes a serious, rabies-like illness that can result in paralysis, delirium, convulsions and death.

Since 1996, 3 people have died in Queensland due to ABLV after they were bitten or scratched by bats.

Dr. Barrett said access to vaccines and public health campaigns highlighting the dangers of handling bats had resulted in only one death over the past 2 decades -- that of an 8-year-old boy from north Queensland in 2013.

"It's quite rare," she said. "But unfortunately, once you do get sick, the outcome is usually pretty bad."

[Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is a potentially lethal zoonotic virus. It was first identified in 1996 and has been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. A few human deaths have been reported due to this virus, generally associated with history of contact with flying foxes or other bats.

Flying foxes belong to the genus _Pteropus_, and they are the largest bats in the world. There are several species.

Education of the public to avoid manipulating bats may prove an effective preventative measure.
