Banana disease identified in St Vincent
---------------------------------------
Agricultural officials here have confirmed that the country's banana
industry is being affected by the dangerous Moko disease. Minister of
Agriculture Montgomery Daniel said the results of the latest set of samples
sent to the Global Plant Health Clinic at the Commonwealth Biological
Institute confirmed the presence of the bacteria _Ralstonia solanacearum_
which causes the Moko disease in bananas.
He noted that for close to 2 years concerns were raised about the presence
of a disease affecting banana plants, but said that no announcement could
have been made until the disease's identity could be verified by an
accredited source. "Moko disease is a very serious and problematic disease
to control and to eradicate," Daniel said.

[Moko disease was 1st reported in Trinidad in the late 1890s leading to
severe losses of Moko cooking bananas. It is caused by the bacterium
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ invading the vascular tissues of the host.
Symptoms are wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, and bacterial ooze
leading to a quick death of the plant. These symptoms are distinguishable
from Panama (fungal) wilt which does not cause symptoms on fruit and there
is no ooze. Moko is endemic in South America and is also present in the
Philippines. The bacterium is spread by water, wind, infected plant
material or soil, and mechanical means including animals and insects.
Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection
can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen
strain.
Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases with reported yield losses
of over 70 per cent. No resistant banana cultivars are known. The primary
means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and
eradication of infected plants where the pathogen is present. It is a
serious quarantine concern in Australia due to its commercial implications
of yield losses and the high costs of control measures needed.
_R. solanacearum_ is a species complex with exceptional diversity amongst
strains from different hosts and geographical origins. Many strains have
less than 70 per cent DNA homology, which has been considered the threshold
level within a species. There are 3 "races" (pathovars) with race 2
affecting banana and plantain. Moko, Bugtok and blood diseases of banana
are caused by different strains of race 2.
A different kind of banana bacterial wilt is caused by _Xanthomonas
campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ and is spreading in Africa. Fungal banana wilt
or Panama disease is caused by _Fusarium oxysporum f.sp.cubense_.
