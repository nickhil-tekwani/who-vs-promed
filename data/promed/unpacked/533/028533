While I was on a WHO consultancy assignment to Bangladesh in August and
September 1997 and again in March 1998, randomized _Aedes aegypti_
perifocal house surveys were carried out under wet season conditions (1997)
during which time the House Index in Dhaka City was 17.3% and in early 1998
(dry season), the HI taken from spot check surveys was 5.6% (From an
unpublished assignment report by myself submitted to the government of
Bangladesh in July 1998).
During the period of 1996/1997 a serological survey (to my knowledge
unpublished) was carried out in Chittagong, the second largest city in
Bangladesh, by Dr Emran Bin Yunis then Assoc. Prof. of Nephrology, Dept. of
Med., Chittagong Medical College, Chittagong and Dr. Dilrose Banu, then
Head of the IEDCR Virology Dept, Dhaka. The investigators collected more
than 500 paired sera from patients admitted to hospital during the months
of July and August 1996, ranging in ages from one month to 15 years, being
admitted with fevers of unknown origin.
Haemaglutination inhibition tests (HI) were performed by the IEDCR and
later confirmed by the Dept. of Virology, AFRIMS Bangkok. HI results showed
that the sera from 17 patients (11%) had antibody titers positive for
dengue. These data strongly suggested that a dengue outbreak had occurred
in the Chittagong area in mid-1996.
