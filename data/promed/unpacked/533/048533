'Baffling' rise in beached whales
---------------------------------
Whale and dolphin watchers are puzzled and alarmed at an
unprecedented spike in the number of deep-water species being
stranded and found dead on Irish beaches in the last 14 weeks. There
has been a similar worrying increase in the number of strandings on
UK coasts -- especially in Scotland -- according to Mick O'Connell of
the Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG).

The species involved include pilot whales (_Globicephala melas_)
Cuvier's beaked whales (_Ziphius cavirostris_), and Sowerby's beaked
whales (_Mesoplodon bidens_).

The IWDG has received an unusually high number of reports of
strandings since the beginning of the year mostly on western and
northern coasts. Between 1 Jan 2008 and 17 Apr 2008, the organization
received reports of 12 separate pilot whale strandings around the
Irish coastline including Cork, Kerry, Sligo, Mayo and Donegal.

It's a shockingly high figure compared with an average over the last
4 years of 2.6 separate pilot whale strandings for the same 3.5 month
period of each year.

"We have also received reports of 5 strandings of either Cuvier's
beaked whales (2) or unidentified beaked whales (3) in County Cork,
Streedagh near Sligo town, Fanad in Donegal and at Sherkin Island,
County Cork.

The average number of stranding incidents involving these beaked
whale species in the years 2003 to 2007 was just 0.6 during the same
period annually.

"It's certainly worrying and we are monitoring the situation," Mr.
O'Connell told the Sunday Independent.

Beaked whales are mysterious creatures of the deep ocean and feed, it
is believed, on or near the sea floor. They have the ability to dive
for extraordinarily long periods and to great depths of more than a
mile, making them the deepest diving air-breathing animals known.

Beaked whales are found in all oceans, but most species rarely
venture into the relatively shallow water of the continental shelves.
They feed primarily on deep water squid, but also on fish and
sometimes on crustaceans. Because they prefer the deep waters, they
are very difficult to observe and little is known of most species.

"In effect, what we are seeing so far this year is that beaked whale
strandings are running at about 8.3 times average, and pilot whale
strandings are running at about 4.6 times the average," Mick
O'Connell has reported on the IWDG website.

"Since February, the west coast of Scotland has also seen a
significant increase in strandings of these species with a minimum of
11 Cuvier's beaked whales, 3 Sowerby's beaked whales and 10 pilot
whales recorded so far.

"In the majority of cases, the animals died at sea and washed ashore
in an advanced state of decomposition, which raises the question of
how many others stranded in inaccessible locations or did not wash
ashore at all," he said.

In previous incidents involving mass strandings of beaked whales,
concerns have been raised over the effects of naval sonar during
military exercises. "At present, we have no evidence of the cause of
death of these cetaceans. It's curious that pilot whales are also
involved," he said.

The IWDG have been in contact with the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in the US as well as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation
Society (UK) and the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St
Andrews, Scotland, to determine if military or seismic operations
were being carried out during the 1st few months of this year.

One theory is that beaked whales are vulnerable to new ultra-loud
anti-submarine sonar, which may force them to surface too quickly and
then die from the bends. However, the large number of Pilot whales
stranded may suggest there is another reason for the increase in dead
cetaceans washed up on our shores.

[According to ProMED-mail 19980512.0934, published on 12 May 1998:

"Peter Evans, of Oxford University, said that periods when there were
few strandings were those when hunting had curbed whale numbers. Dr.
Evans co-ordinates the Sea Watch Foundation, whose volunteers record
whale sightings. He said there was no evidence that dead whales had
absorbed high levels of pollution. The end of hunting had led to more
competition between male whales, with those who headed north finding
food scarce in winter. He and Dr. Smeenk suspect that young males
swim into coastal waters in search of food."

It is unclear whether all these whales beached themselves while
alive, or whether they were already dead and washed ashore. The
article does indicate a majority washed up in an advanced state of
autolysis, which would negate most useful information from any
samples. Necropsy samples do not appear to have been tested for
cetacean morbillivirus . Please see 2007 ProMED post 20070831.2866:
"Cetacean morbillivirus, dolphins - Spain", which mentions pilot
whales could also be affected -- perhaps because of the difficulty in
getting specimens from a creature of that size. Morbilliviruses in
marine mammals cause pathology which prevents them from breathing, so
that they drown. - Mod.JW]

As most of these whales are usually deep water animals, little is
known about them. The source of their demise may be somewhere in the
"deep"! - Mod.TG]
