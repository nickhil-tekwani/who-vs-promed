NSW [New South Wales] Health is urging anyone who has visited the Town Hall area in the Sydney CBD [Central Business District] and has symptoms such as fever, chills, a cough, and shortness of breath to see their doctor after an outbreak of legionnaires' disease.

Four men are in hospital with the disease, which is thought to have been contracted from air-conditioning systems in central Sydney. The men each spent time in the Sydney CBD, NSW Health said on [Wed 9 Mar 2016].

Cooling towers in the area are being inspected as outbreaks are often associated with contaminated air-conditioning systems in large buildings.

Legionnaires' disease is a type of pneumonia caused by a bacterial infection of the lungs that can develop after someone breathes contaminated water vapour or dust.
