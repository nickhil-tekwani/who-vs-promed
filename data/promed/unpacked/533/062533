Media reports of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan
---------------------------------------------------
Media reports have claimed that 75 people, including 8 who have died, have
been infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus in
Pakistan, on the border with Afghanistan.
The WHO Country Office in Pakistan and its team in Quetta, and the WHO
Office for the Eastern Mediterranean Region have investigated this report.
Their findings follow:
This week, a hospital in Quetta [Pakistan opened a new ward specifically
for managing CCHF patients, since cases occur each year in the region. As
soon as the ward was open, 4 suspected cases were transferred or referred
by other health care providers to the new ward. All the cases were from
Pakistan, had disease onset within the past week, and were not linked.
As per the usual procedure, samples have been collected and sent to the
National Institute of Health in Islamabad.
The total number of suspected CCHF cases reported in Pakistan in 2001 is 41
cases with 12 deaths (onset March to October).
An additional 6 cases with 2 deaths (onset May to August) were persons
infected in Afghanistan who were treated in Pakistan.
In summary, these recent cases exhibit the typical pattern for this endemic
disease.

[Thanks to Jeffery Jordan, Pamela Das, and others who sent in media reports
on the situation. This is an endemic sporadic disease that gives the
impression of an epidemic, because so many people, including the sick, are
crowding the border areas now. - Mod.JW
