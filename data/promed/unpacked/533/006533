Virus plagues Pimlico
-------------------------
An outbreak of equine herpes virus claimed a 3rd horse at Pimlico Race
Course and prompted the cancellation of 2 days of racing at nearby Laurel
Park, officials said yesterday [26 Jan 2006].
Racing at Laurel Park on Sunday [29 Jan 2006] and 5 Feb 2006 has been
canceled because of the quarantine of 500 horses at Pimlico and
restrictions on the movement of horses in and out of the state due to the
outbreak, the Maryland Jockey Club announced.
The 3rd horse to die of the disease at the home of the Preakness Stakes was
General Strike, who showed symptoms of the virus last Thursday [19 or 26
Jan 2006? - Copy Editor.MSP]. The 3-year-old didn't show signs of
improvement and recovery was unlikely, so trainer Joe Delozier decided to
have the horse euthanized, the Jockey Club said in a statement.
The Maryland Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, announced that 2 cases
of suspected equine herpes prompted a quarantine at a Kent County stable
that received a horse from Pimlico Race Course before the quarantine was
instituted at the track.
One horse was euthanized, and another is showing symptoms of the disease at
the undisclosed stable, which is used as an off-track training facility for
a Pimlico-based trainer, the Maryland Department of Agriculture said.
The disease, which doesn't affect humans, can cause upper respiratory
infections in horses as well as neurological symptoms that may affect the
ability to walk and run. 11 horses at Pimlico have shown signs of the virus
this month [January 2006].

[This disease is still having a major effect on Maryland and on the racing
at these facilities. Hopefully, they will soon have the elusive virus more
thoroughly eliminated, and the tracks can get back to normal.
Although the triple crown racing season is still some 4 months away, the
officials are undoubtedly apprehensive about this situation. - Mod.TG]
