End of the fowl plague outbreak in sight
----------------------------------------
The last outbreak of fowl plague [highly pathogenic avian influenza,
HPAI], affecting a commercial poultry holding in Kelpen (Limburg),
was confirmed on 23 May 2003. In a letter of Tue, 3 Jun 2003 by
Minister of Agriculture Veerman to the Parliament, he described the
improved situation while indicating that a new outbreak is still a
possibility.
<http://www.minlnv.nl/infomart/parlemnt/2003/par03173.htm>
Veterinary experts regard the mean incubation period of HPAI in
poultry to be 10 days. In view of the period elapsed since the last
dates of suspected as well as confirmed outbreaks, the poultry sector
can breathe a sigh of relief.
Alertness, though, must be maintained since the virus can survive in
litter and manure longer than a month. For this reason, Veerman wants
all litter and manure from infected poultry farms to be transported,
until the end of next week, to 2 designated dumping locations. The
manure will be kept covered for 120 days and then released for use
[as fertilizer].
Next week, the remaining susceptible pet-avians should be culled in
the areas previously affected by HPAI. The Gelders valley is already
"empty," and in North-Brabant and Limburg the gassing of the birds is
almost accomplished. The remaining private addresses of owners will
soon be visited by the culling teams. According to the Dutch
Association of Pet Avians Owners [Vereniging van Hobbydierhouders],
quite a number of pet chickens and ducks have been hidden by their
owners.
Subsequent to the removal of manure and pet avians, the poultry
owners in the affected areas should disinfect their premises. This is
required to be carried out twice, 5 days apart. The following step,
intended to verify the absence of the virus on the premises, will be
carried out by the introduction of several (1 percent of the
holding's normal poultry population) susceptible sentinel chickens,
which will be allowed to move around the holding for 3 weeks. Should
they remain healthy, then all production activities can be renewed.
In view of all these measures, the ministry does not envisage the
renewal of production earlier than the end of July 2003. A condition
is that the EU Commission agree to waive the limiting measures,
including the export ban. Until then, the entire poultry sector in
the affected region is inactive.
The HPAI outbreak has cost the life of almost 30 million chickens on
255 poultry holdings (including 22 pet-avians premises). The poultry
owners association is of the opinion that some of these farms will
never return to business.

[A set of measures to be carried out before the restrictions in the
surveillance zones (minimum 10 km around confirmed outbreaks) may be
lifted has been agreed upon by the Standing Committee on the Food
Chain and Animal Health in its last meeting, 28 May 2003. See: Avian
influenza: Further easing of restrictions,
<http://europa.eu.int/rapid/start/cgi/guesten.ksh?p_action.gettxt=gt&doc=IP/03/775|0|RAPID&lg=EN&display>
Animal feed, litter, and manure from infected holdings has to be
removed and destroyed. The repopulation of these holdings can only
take place after the introduction of sentinel birds has demonstrated
the absence of any avian influenza virus.
The situation and measures with regard to avian influenza will be
reviewed at the next meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food
Chain and Animal Health, scheduled for 13 Jun 2003. - Mod.AS]
