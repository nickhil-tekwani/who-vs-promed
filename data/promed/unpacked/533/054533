Kalol taluka [a taluka is a local unit of administrative division in some countries of the Indian subcontinent that is usually translated to "township" - Mod.LL] in Gandhinagar is affected by a cholera outbreak with more than 100 suspected patients and 4 deaths since 3 Jul 2021, taluka health officer Dr Hemangini Patel confirmed on Tuesday [6 Jul 2021].

The district collectorate's office also issued a notification on Tuesday declaring a 2-kilometer area [1.2 mi] in the Kalol municipality in Gujarat State as a "cholera-affected" zone. The stretch includes a population of nearly 10 000 as per the taluka health officer's estimate and has been contained.

"We sent samples from 5 patients for laboratory testing of which 2 have been confirmed (with _Vibrio cholerae_ strains). Even if one patient sample turns out positive, as per government guidelines, it has to be notified to IDSP (Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme)," said Dr Patel. "As of 5 Jul 2021, there were 76 suspected cases of which 3 died. The latest report is pending, but approximately there are 30 suspected cases with one death. Onset of symptoms was since 3 Jul 2021. Suspected cause is contaminated water of a water supply tank of 10 lakh liters [1 lakh = 100 000 - Mod.LL] where 4 leakages were found. Water samples were sent for testing and reports are awaited," said Dr Patel.

Of the 106 suspected cases, 29 are hospitalized, Patel said, adding a 5-year-old girl, a 4-year-old boy, a 9-year-old girl and a 40-year-old man were among the dead. Earlier, Nadiad taluka in Kheda district reported at least 4 cholera cases since the end of June 2021.

[The number of local cases has increased.

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J [eds]. NY: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (e.g., refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."

"Gujarat is a state on the western coast of India with a coastline of 1600 km (990 mi) -- most of which lies on the Kathiawar peninsula -- and a population of 60.4 million. It is the 5th-largest Indian state by area and the 9th-largest state by population. Gujarat is bordered by Rajasthan to the northeast, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu to the south, Maharashtra to the southeast, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and the Arabian Sea and the Pakistani province of Sindh to the west. Its capital city is Gandhinagar, while its largest city is Ahmedabad" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat). Its location can be found at the preceding URL. - Mod.LL
