Hazara Division Commissioner Abid Ali Khan has directed various line departments of all the districts in Hazara Division [Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province] to provide free medical treatment and take precautionary measures for protection against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infection, which has claimed the lives of 2 people hailing from Havelian, a suburb of Abbottabad. An emergency meeting, headed by the Hazara commissioner, has alerted the district administrations of all the six districts and Health and Livestock Departments to take the remedial steps to cope with the deadly disease and asked the provincial government to declaring Hazara division as an affected area.

CCHF is a viral disease that occurs primarily in animals but humans are also susceptible to it. The disease is indigenous to many African, European, and Asian countries. Being a tickborne disease, the majority of the people who contract the virus are involved in the livestock industry. The meeting, attended by Deputy Speaker National Assembly Murtaza Javed Abbassi, Abbottabad deputy commissioner, Combined Military Hospital commandant, medical superintendents of the Ayub Teaching Hospital and district Headquarter Hospital and representative of Livestock Department, was briefed by Abbottabad District Health Officer Dr Zafeer.

Livestock officials were asked to check the animals from the entry points of every district and butchers would be asked to use special masks and gloves during the cutting of animals. The movement of the animals in the district would be banned in all the districts for which section 144 is also imposed in all the districts. Officials of the WHO were asked to provide the special kits and medicines to be used for the treatment of CCHF virus patients.

It may be recalled here that 2 patients who had contracted CCHF previously died in Abbottabad including a serving doctor about 2 years ago. Dr Hasnain Shah, a resident medical officer (RMO) at the Ayub Teaching Hospital, also died due to the deadly CCHF.

[CCHF outbreaks are often associated with a change in situation such as war, population and animal movements, or climatic and vegetation changes which produce more ground cover for small mammals which act as hosts for ticks. The incubation period of CCHF appears to vary according to the mode of acquisition of the virus. If a patient has been infected by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days and up to 9 days. Infection via contact with infected blood or tissues leads to an incubation period of 5-6 days, and the maximum recorded incubation period is 13 days.

The illness begins abruptly, with fever, muscle aches, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). Nausea, vomiting, and sore throat may also occur, with diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Over the next few days, the patient may experience mood swings, confusion and aggression, followed by sleepiness, depression, and liver enlargement. More severe symptoms may follow, including petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin), bruising and generalised bleeding of the gums and orifices. In severe cases, patients develop failure of the liver, kidneys, and lungs and become drowsy and comatose after 5 days. Approximately 30 percent of cases are fatal. General supportive therapy is given, including replacement of blood components, balancing fluids and electrolytes, and maintaining oxygen status and blood pressure. There is evidence that CCHF responds to treatment with the antiviral drug ribavirin, in both oral and intravenous formulations.

Persons living in or visiting endemic areas should use personal protective measures to avoid contact with ticks. This includes avoiding areas where ticks are abundant at times when they are active, using tick repellents, and carefully checking clothing and skin for ticks. Those who work with livestock or other animals in endemic areas should protect themselves by using tick repellents on their skin and clothing and wearing gloves or other protective clothing to prevent skin coming into contact with infected tissue or blood. (For more detailed information, see http://www.hpa.org.uk/Topics/InfectiousDiseases/InfectionsAZ/CCHF/GeneralInformation/cchfBackgroundinformation/.)

Ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector of CCHF virus. It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production. Currently, there is no protection vaccine available for either livestock or humans.
