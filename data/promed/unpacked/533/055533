DHAKA (May 4) XINHUA - Diarrhea claimed 86 lives in Bangladesh in the first
four months of this year, The Independent daily reported Monday quoting
officials in Dhaka's Directorate of Health Service.
At least 64,000 persons were affected by diarrhea in 17 districts across
the 64-district country in the period, according to the officials. The
highest number of deaths was registered in the southeast district of
Noakhali where the disease took away the lives of 27 persons.
Of the total number of patients, 17,828 were found in the northeast
district of Kishoreganj, followed by 11,500, 6,700 and 4,500 in the
southwest, northwest and north districts of Khulna, Naogaon and Netrokona
respectively. The officials denied the outbreak of the disease in an
epidemic form, but said local medical teams have been working in the
disease-affected areas to check the spread of the disease.
Besides, diarrhea-affected patients from Dhaka and its adjoining areas have
been rushed to the city's International Center for Diarrheal Diseases
Research, the report said. Usually, about 200 to 250 patients go to the
center for treatment on average daily, but now as many as more than 500
patients go there for treatment a day. The center treated more than 14,000
patients in April, the center's chief physician, Abdus Salam, said. The
center usually has the largest number of patients from the end of March to
May every year and 60 percent of them are children below five years of age,
he noted. Salam attributed most of the cases mainly to the intake of
polluted water and contaminated food. A recent survey report on diarrheal
diseases in Bangladesh showed that 35 percent of the deaths in the country
were due to persistent diarrhea, Salam added.

[Most of these cases are certainly cholera. The International Center for
Diarrheal Diseases Research which is now seeing 500 cases a day is a
world-famous cholera research center, and its annual reports regularly
report the isolation of cholera from cases in Bangladesh. But because the
country fears a ban on its shrimp exports, it steadfastly refuses to admit
that the disease occurs, or to report it to WHO as required by the
International Health Regulations. It even supposedly claims that 64,000
cases is not an epidemic (see above).
Perhaps it will now follow the lead of Thailand, and start to admit that,
yes, it does have cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ infection, even if they are
not going to call it cholera yet -- see:
