Sudan's polio outbreak raises alarm
---------------------------------
Officials from the World Health Organization (WHO) say the number of
confirmed cases of polio in Sudan has made a dramatic rebound in a country
that had been declared polio-free 3 years ago.
The tiny, sand-blown Arab village of Hara al-Zawiyah, in a remote corner of
Darfur, appears to be spared the violence and suffering endemic to the rest
of western Sudan. But even here, people are increasingly fearful of the
diseases taking hold after 2 years of civil war.
Polio has surged to the top of their list of concerns, after a child in the
town of Kass, less than 90 miles to the south, was paralyzed by it 6 months
ago.
Since then, World Health Organization officials say the number of confirmed
cases of polio-induced paralysis in Sudan has soared to 54. Because
paralysis of limbs occurs in only one in 200 cases, health experts say
there is a high probability that more than 10 000 Sudanese have been
infected with the virus, prompting several U.N. aid agencies to issue
repeated warnings that Sudan is in the midst of a massive outbreak.
Particularly disturbing for health workers is the virus's potential for
spreading in the crowded, festering camps of western Sudan and neighboring
Chad, where nearly 2 million people have sought refuge in the wake of
atrocities by pro-government Arab militias aiming to crush a rebel uprising.
In much of Darfur, ongoing attacks by militias and rebel fighters have
forced U.N. agencies and non-governmental aid groups to evacuate their
workers, halting the distribution of food and medicine to hundreds of
thousands of people left homeless by the conflict.
Bruce Aylward, head of WHO's global polio eradication initiative, explains
why the surge in Sudan's polio cases is sending shock waves through the
international health community. He speaks by telephone from Geneva.
"There are 3 factors that make the situation in Sudan particularly
alarming," said Mr. Aylward. "1st of all, it's the largest country in
Africa in terms of land mass, and borders 9 other countries. So there are
porous borders with 9 countries across which this virus could now spread.
Secondly, there's the internal situation in the country where there's civil
unrest or disturbances in 2 large areas of the country, which really could
allow the continued propagation of the virus within the country. And then,
finally, the Sudan, being both an Arab and an African country, in many ways
has got important international links which could lead to the further
dissemination of the virus and even the re-infection of the Middle East."
Health workers have eliminated the virus in the Americas, Europe and most
of Asia. But in Africa, which has 90 percent of the world's polio cases,
armed conflict and persistent distrust of Western vaccines continue to
hamper efforts by health workers to immunize about 74 million children most
vulnerable to the virus.
In Hara al-Zawiyah, a health team from UNICEF, the United Nations fund for
children, visited on a recent morning. The health workers took only a few
hours to squeeze 2 drops of vaccine on each tongue of hundreds of the
village's children. About 2400 health workers have fanned out across Darfur
to administer the vaccine to nearly 2 million children 5 years old and younger.
Several cases of polio in Sudan and Botswana have been traced back to
Nigeria, believed to be the epicenter of the virus in Africa. The northern
Nigerian state of Kano reported nearly 700 confirmed cases, 7 times the
number of cases reported by India, the world's 2nd most polio-prone country.
Mr. Aylward, head of WHO's global polio eradication initiative, says the
surge in Sudan's polio outbreak threatens the success of the USD 2 billion
anti-polio drive, the largest-ever health initiative in the world.
"What we are seeing again is the fragility of the progress that has been
made against [sic] polio eradication," he said. "Many people are taking
comfort in the very low numbers of polio in the world, but what happened in
the Sudan reminds us that this disease can explode in a country where we've
not seen it for a long time. And it can spread from there into other areas.
Particular concern of course [is that], from the Sudan, it could get into
the Middle East or, with the borders with the Congo, it could re-infect
that country. And any of these developments would make the global
eradication much, much higher risk, much, much more difficult, and much,
much more expensive."
The virus often infects young children. Once the virus enters in the
bloodstream, it attacks the central nervous system, causing muscular
atrophy, deformation, paralysis and sometimes death.
In addition to the problems in Sudan, the campaign to eradicate polio has
hit another snag: a USD 200 million budget shortfall, as some countries
have yet to deliver promised funding to the program. The shortfall has led
some U.N. officials to consider postponing or reducing immunization
programs in Africa and Asia.

[ProMED-mail 1st reported on the presumed importation of polio to the Sudan
in June 2004 (Poliomyelitis - Sudan ex Nigeria 20040622.1667). The above
report of 54 confirmed cases in the past 6 months is disturbing, as it
clearly indicates a reestablished circulation of the wild poliovirus in the
country, an area with civil unrest and difficulties in terms of delivery of
services, such as immunizations, as well as mass population movement in
response to the civil unrest. (A report of the IRIN -- Integrated Regional
Information Networks (IRIN), part of the UN Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) -- dated today, 16 Dec 2004, highlights these
challenges and can be found at
<http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=44699&SelectRegion=East_Africa&SelectCountry=SUDAN>).
Prior to this outbreak, transmission of wild poliovirus had been
interrupted in April 2001, leaving an interval of just over 3 years without
reports of cases. Of note, the most recent confirmed case count from the
Sudan, available on the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/fixed/casecount.shtml>,
is 47 cases, 7 less than reported in the above newswire. Perhaps a
clarification from knowledgeable sources would be of assistance. - Mod.MPP]
