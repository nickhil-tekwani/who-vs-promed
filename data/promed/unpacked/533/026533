Ministry Dispels Fears Over Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever
---------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI: 3 Kenyan families from Western Province who attended the funeral
ceremony of an Ebola hemorrhagic fever victim in Uganda are under
surveillance, the Government said yesterday. The Minister for Medical
Services, Dr. Amukowa Anangwe, said the families comprising 7 individuals
left and entered Kenya through unnamed [unmanned? border points.
The information, Anangwe said, was relayed to the Ministry by the Director
General of Health Services in Uganda on Mon 13 Nov 2000. Within 24 hours of
receiving the information, the Ministry, in conjunction with the Provincial
Administration and the police, managed to trace the families and to
quarantine them at their homes in Busia, Kitale and Mount Kenya. On
examination, the families have shown no signs of the disease. They will
continue to be under surveillance for 42 days as required by the World
Health Organisation (WHO) before they are declared free of infection.
The 7 individuals under quarantine are relatives of a Ugandan woman who
died of the viral infection in early November. Ugandan officials said that
the victim had unwittingly spread the epidemic when she fled the center of
the outbreak in the Ugandan town of Gulu to return to her home district in
a vain attempt to escape the disease. The 7 Kenyans, who have since
returned to their homes in Western Kenya, are among 150 people who attended
the funeral now being tracked by Ugandan authorities. "So far up to 150
contacts have been identified. These include the 7 Kenyan nationals who had
travelled from Kenya to participate in the burial," a health ministry
statement said.
Anangwe said that since the country was notified of the Ebola hemorrhagic
fever outbreak in parts of Uganda, the Ministry had continued to carry out
screening at all [manned border entry points and international airports
for travellers from Uganda. So far, he said, 20 000 people have been
screened and no case of Ebola fever has been detected.
He assured Kenyans that to date, there is no reported [confirmed case of
Ebola fever in the country. He requested that those living along the border
notify local chiefs and immigration officials of all visitors checking into
the country. He appealed to those with relatives across the border not to
attend funeral ceremonies of Ebola fever victims until the epidemic is
over. The minister advised travellers to use official immigration points
exclusively.
