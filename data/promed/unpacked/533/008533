According to the press service of the Regional Office of Rosselkhoznadzor [the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance], 614 animals were [euthanized] due to an outbreak of ASF [African swine fever] on a farm in the Ust-Labinsk district of the Krasnodar region.

According to the Regional Directorate of Veterinary Medicine, the focus of ASF was detected in the territory of the Sokol farm in the village of Voronezh. 614 pigs were killed and the dead animals were burned.

The Ust-Labinsk district continues to work round the clock in the 7 security-quarantine posts, which should prevent the further spread of ASF. Employees visited more than 2000 farmsteads.

The State Veterinary Administration of Kuban [geographic region in southern Russia] delivered additional disinfectants for spraying.

During an outbreak of ASF in Kuban in 2012, the pig industry in the region lost 266 000 animals, resulting in a roughly 30 per cent fall in the production of pork in the region.

Most cases of ASF in the south of Russia are registered in the Krasnodar region.

According to REGNUM, the regional veterinary committee reported that on 7 Aug 2015, African swine fever was detected in wild boar in the Zhirnovsky hunting estate in the Volgograd region.

The warning to the veterinary services came from the police, who when checking the vehicle of a local resident found 3 wild animal carcasses. As it turned out, the wild boars tested positive for swine fever.

The dangerous virus was once again detected on the border with the Saratov region, where this summer [ASF] was recorded in many localities. According to IA REGNUM, another outbreak of swine fever was reported in the Elan area of the Volgograd region in early July 2015. 6 animals died from the virus in 1 of the private holdings of the village of Ters. In the affected zone, which includes Elansky, Kikvidzensky, Rudnyansky, Zhirnovsky and Danilovsky districts and the city of Mikhaylovka, restrictions were placed on the sale of pig products and categorical ban on free grazing of pigs.

We add that the 1st outbreaks of ASF in the region in 2015 were recorded in the spring. In early March 2015 a hotbed of swine fever was detected in the Frolovsky area. A few days later an outbreak was reported in 2 pigs in 1 of the private holdings of the Kozlowski Rudnyanskogo rural settlement area. On 10 Mar 2015, due to the outbreak of ASF, special precautions were introduced in 5 districts of the Volgograd region -- Rudnyanskogo, Elan, Danilov, and Kotovskogo Zhirnovsky.

[Russia's most recent ASF follow-up report (No 60) was submitted to the OIE on 7 Aug 2015, notifying of 6 new outbreaks, of which 2 were in domestic swine and 4 in wild boars (for the respective locations and additional details, including an interactive map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=18332.

The total statistics as reported to the OIE since the start of the current epizootic (in Jan 2014) are as follows:
Total outbreaks = 120 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / 206 857 / 2801 / 2552 / 203 721 / 0
Wild boar / - / 262 / 169 / 132 / 0

Since the beginning of August 2015, 6 European countries have reported new ASF cases: Russia, Ukraine, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Lithuania.

As can be seen in OIE's interactive map showing all ASF outbreaks reported since 1 Aug 2015 (http://tinyurl.com/patncfv), the advancing front of ASF, moving westwards, currently lies between the eastern frontier of Poland in the south, through the eastern regions of Lithuania and Latvia, with the northernmost ASF area currently situated in Estonia. - Mod.AS
