More than 130 birds caught in Jersey were found to have a potentially deadly form of avian [pox], according to Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust. Glenn Young, from the trust, said 138 starlings caught and ringed at Trinity Manor were showing signs of avian pox.

The disease, which is spread by mosquitoes, cannot affect humans. It causes uncomfortable growths, meaning it is difficult for birds to feed.

Mr Young wants people in Jersey to be on the lookout for the signs. He said: "A lot of these birds like starlings and great tits will be seen on people's bird tables, so people may see these problems. Usually, they are warty-like structures around the face, the eye, and the bill, and also on the legs."

[Avian pox is a slowly developing disease of birds caused by several different strains of avipoxvirus. A variety of birds worldwide, including upland gamebirds, marine birds, Passeriformes, and Psittaciformes can become infected.

Avian pox occurs in 2 forms, the cutaneous being the commoner. The cutaneous form of pox causes warty growths on unfeathered skin, sometimes in large clusters. The size and number of growths depend on the stage and severity of infection. Birds are often emaciated due to inability to feed (see picture of the lesions at http://partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/avian-atlas/sites/agilestaging.library.cornell.edu.avian-atlas/files/avian_atlas_assets/POX-038A%20x750.jpg). In the diphtheritic form, there are raised, yellow plaques on the mucus membranes of the mouth and throat.

Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected birds, ingestion of food and water contaminated by sick birds or carcasses, or contact with contaminated surfaces such as bird feeders and perches. The virus enters through abraded skin. Insects, especially mosquitoes, may act as mechanical vectors. The disease can be a significant mortality factor in some upland game bird populations during fall and winter months, in songbirds over winter, and in raptor populations.
