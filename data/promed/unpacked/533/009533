Rwamagana farmers wary of unknown banana disease
------------------------------------------------
Banana growers in Rwamagana District [Eastern province] have expressed
worry over what they refer to as an unknown disease that has attacked
their crop. Banana leaves in most plantations in the area have
yellowed and shown signs of withering.

A farmer said that half of his 2-hectare [5 acre] plantation has been
attacked and efforts to control the disease by local methods have not
been successful. Banana farming is the only income for his family. "We
are relying on speculation. Agricultural officials have seen the issue
and we are still waiting for action."

Another farmer said that the problem remains mysterious with no hope
of reviving the crop. "My own plantation is alright, but my neighbours
have indeed great problems. It must be a disease not yet known to
farmers and agricultural officers."

According to an agricultural officer the problem is spreading fast.
"We are afraid it may spread to other areas, the effect may be greater
than earlier anticipated," he said.

[A number of banana pathogens have been reported from Rwanda,
including for example _Banana bunchy top virus_, black sigatoka
(caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_), and bacterial wilt
(BXW, caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_, first
reported in 2007 from Gisenyi province).

>From the report above it appears that the problem is spreading, which
would suggest that an infectious disease agent is likely to be
involved. The pathogen(s) may not have been observed in this
particular area previously, however, it may possibly have been
reported from elsewhere in the country. Reliable diagnosis is urgently
required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for
farmers.
