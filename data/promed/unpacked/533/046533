While humans are trying to fight the deadly novel coronavirus across the globe, cattle in the country's northern districts, under Rangpur division, are getting infected at an alarming pace by another highly contagious virus: lumpy skin disease (LSD). According to independent sources and affected cattle owners, at least 50 cattle, mostly calves, have died with nearly 20 000 infected with LSD in 7 out of 8 districts in the division over the last several months.

However, livestock officials in the districts provided different figures of infections and deaths of cattle in their respective districts. According to their official tally, Thakurgaon has so far seen the highest number of deaths, 15, and 2000 infections; Kurigram 7 deaths and 3000 infections; Dinajpur 5 deaths and 3000 infections; Nilphamari 4 deaths and 2000 infections; and Lalmonirhat 2 deaths and 2000 infections.

Livestock officials in Rangpur and Gaibandha said their districts had 3100 and 420 infections, respectively, with no incidents of death. Panchagarh officials said there was neither any infection nor any death relating to LSD in the district.

In a news report published in the paper on 10 Jun 2020, headlined "Lumpy skin disease virus killing cattle in Saidpur: farmers say they lost as many as 20 cattle to LSD in a couple of months", Saidpur Upazila livestock officer Rashedul Haque said 9 cattle, mostly calves, had died of "secondary infection" of LSD in his upazila alone.

While speaking with this correspondent, Altaf Hossain, livestock officer in Rangpur, said deaths of animals would be lower, and the spread of LSD virus could be curbed if all the livestock offices in the upazilas of the division had sufficient manpower to provide treatment to all infected animals in a timely manner. Besides, cattle owners allowing local quacks to treat the infected animals were also contributing to the rise in the number of deaths, he added.

Many owners of infected cattle said that within 2-3 days, numerous rounded lumps become evident under the skin of an animal; the lumps turn into open sores that show signs of discharge. It also develops high fever, general malaise and strong aversion to food before dying within a few days. Shreyoshee Karmaker, an intern of veterinary medicine at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University in Dinajpur, said there is no specific treatment available for LSD at the moment, and they are prescribing symptomatic medications such as parcetamol for fever and pain.

Officials at the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) in Rangpur division said LSD is not native to Bangladesh, and the country's first LSD infection was reported last year [2019] in Chattogram. They said since there is no treatment available for LSD, they have been taking preventive measures by vaccinating cattle in the region. Dr Habibul Haq, deputy director of DLS in Rangpur, said the LSD outbreak had been kept to a minimum as they have brought 600 000 cattle under coverage of goatpox vaccination in 8 districts of Rangpur this year [2020] already.

[This is a 2nd report from the same source within a week, addressing the continued spread of LSD in Bangladesh's northern division, Rangpur.

Bangladesh experienced its first ever LSD event in 2019; it started, according to the notification to the OIE, mid-July 2019 and was declared as resolved on 22 Mar 2020 (last outbreak, out of a total of 4, reported as starting on 2 Sep 2019). The reports and an interactive map presenting their locations are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31742.

The recurrence (or rediscovery?) of the disease and its spread deserve official confirmation and notification to the OIE. LSD has also been spreading, since summer 2019, in India, starting in the north east.

OIE's interactive map of LSD outbreaks reported globally since 1 Jan 2019 is available at https://tinyurl.com/y7v29a4y (click on Bangladesh and/or Northeast India to center, and zoom in to the required resolution. - Mod.AS
