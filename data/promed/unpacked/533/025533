Fish farmers bemoan ban on shipments
---------------------------------------------
A government crackdown on live fish shipments from the Great Lakes
states is intended to check the spread of a deadly aquatic virus, but
critics say it could devastate the region's fishing industry.
In an emergency order last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service banned interstate
transport of 37 species of live fish from the 8 states adjacent to
the Great Lakes. Importing those species from the Canadian provinces
of Ontario and Quebec also was prohibited.
The agency's target is viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS), which
poses no risk to humans but causes internal bleeding in fish. VHS was
discovered in the region last year [2005] and is blamed for fish
kills in lakes Erie, Ontario and St. Clair and the St. Lawrence
River. Among species susceptible to the virus are popular sport fish
such as chinook and coho salmon, rainbow trout, walleye and yellow perch.
Federal officials do not know how the virus, long a problem in
Europe, reached the Great Lakes. But state fishery managers believe
it came in ballast tanks of oceangoing cargo ships, considered a
leading source of exotic species, such as zebra mussels, that are
damaging the lakes' ecology.
The federal agency has scheduled a meeting with state and industry
representatives for Tuesday [31 Oct 2006] in Washington, D.C. to
discuss regulations aimed at containing the virus. The emergency
order "just puts everything on hold until we can figure out what
we're going to do," spokesman Jim Rogers said.
But some in the region said they were blindsided by the order, which
could be especially hard on commercial fish farms and live bait
vendors. It also could hamper [fish] stocking programs essential to
the region's USD 4.5 billion fishery, critics said.
"This order will completely eliminate long-established trades of
sport fish between state agencies that are crucial to the
maintenance, restoration and enhancement of sport fish programs" in
the region, Sam Flood, acting director of the Illinois Department of
Natural Resources, wrote in a letter to the federal agency.
Dan Vogler, who raises rainbow trout in Harrietta, about 30 miles
south of Traverse City, said the order had taken away 70 percent of
his customers. He sends live fish to other states for sale in
restaurants and markets and for stocking lakes and rivers.
The virus hasn't been detected on any fish farm in the Great Lakes
region, Vogler said. Michigan has 47 fish farms, with combined sales
of USD 2.4 million in 2005, according to the USDA.
Greg Oswald, president of the Minnesota Aquaculture Association,
sells his fathead minnows for sport fishing bait across the nation.
He estimated his business could lose USD 600 000 this year [2006] and
more in 2007 if the interstate ban continues.
Dealers who supply bait shops in Ohio buy about half their stock from
other states, said Fred Snyder, an Ohio State University extension
agent. Ohio's trout farmers get young fish to raise from other
states. Meanwhile, trout farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin have
millions of pounds ready for stocking lakes elsewhere. "All of a
sudden, they can't move these fish," Snyder said. "These people are
going to be financially devastated."
The National Aquaculture Association, a fish farming trade group,
asked the government for regulations to help prevent the virus from
spreading, said its president, Randy MacMillan. He said the
association didn't request the emergency order but understands the
need. It could take the federal agency 2 or 3 months just to write
interim rules, MacMillan said. "In the meantime, the movement of
potentially infected live fish would continue," he said.

[Viral hemorrhagic disease affects freshwater and saltwater fish. The
causative virus is in the family _Rhabdoviridae_ and is a
_Novirhabdovirus_. The disease can be transmitted by asymptomatic
carriers, or by clinically ill fish. It can be transmitted through
the water or through direct contact. The virus is also carried in
sexual fluids, urine and feces. When the water has an overall
temperature of 20 C, the infectivity of the virus is lost in
approximately 24 hours. Conversely, the infectivity is maintained for
several days when the water temperature is a constant 4 C. Therefore,
it stands to reason that the incubation time is related to water
temperature and ranges from between 7 & 15 days.
There are 3 different syndromes associated with the virus outbreak.
Those 3 symptoms include nervous, chronic and acute. They may overlap
to the point that all of these may be seen at one time during an
outbreak. Some fish may hemorrhage, some may be seen to have
neurological signs, such as swimming in circles. It is considered a
reportable disease in many states in the USA. - Mod.TG]
