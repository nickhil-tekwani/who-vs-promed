For the 2nd time this year [2010], a Nueces County man is being
treated for St. Louis encephalitis [SLE], a disease [virus]
transmitted through mosquito bites. The man was hospitalized, but has
been released, according to the Nueces County Public Health District.
His name and details of his illness were not released. 2 weeks
ago[week of 18 Oct 2010], health officials determined a man who
originally tested positive for West Nile virus actually had St. Louis
encephalitis, officials said. That man has since recovered.

Since 1990, 74 people in Texas have tested positive for St. Louis
encephalitis [virus infection], according to the Texas Department of
State Health Services. Unlike West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis
comes in spurts, and most years, there are no cases of the
mosquito-borne disease found in humans, according to state records.
The last Texas death from the virus was in 1995.

Noelia Rodriguez of the county health district said mosquito season
is likely over for the year, but people still should take
precautions. That means avoiding time outside during peak mosquito
hours, from dusk until dawn, and wearing insect repellent. "With the
cooler temperatures we should start to be out of the woods,"
Rodriguez said, noting no mosquitoes could be found during the last
collection period Thursday [28 Oct 2010].

[The ProMED-mail report of 21 Oct 2010 (archive no. 20101021.3811)
indicated that there was a possible 2nd SLE virus infection in an
individual in Nueces County awaiting laboratory confirmation. That
case has now been confirmed as SLEV. His recovery is good news.

SLEV is transmitted from wild birds to humans by _Culex_ mosquitoes,
and causes sporadic outbreaks and scattered individual cases in areas
where it is endemic.
