About 1 170 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

Hong Kong SAR: 3 pigs from a Mainland registered pig farm for supply to Hong Kong were admitted to the Sheung Shui Slaughterhouse on 2 Sep 2019, found dead on 3 Sep 2019, tested positive for ASF [see OIE notification at 20190906.6659259].

Viet Nam:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its 1st ASF outbreak on 19 Feb 2019, a total of 63 provinces/cities reported outbreaks and more than 4 500 000 pigs have been culled.

Laos:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak in Salavan Province on 20 Jun 2019, a total of 94 ASF outbreaks have been reported in 15 of its 18 provinces/city. More than 25 000 pigs have died or been destroyed due to ASF. [Laos' last follow-up report to the OIE was submitted 28 Aug 2019; see at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=31565.]

New actions undertaken during the week
-----------------------------------------
China:
The Vice Premier of the State Council attended the national video conference on stable pig production to support market supply on 30 Aug 2019, and stressed thorough implementation of the instructions of the General Secretary and Premier, promptly taking effective measures to stabilize the recovery of pig production, ensuring pork supply and market prices, severely cracking down on illegal activities, increasing the scale of frozen pork reserves, continuing ASF prevention and control measures, strictly implementing the epidemic reporting system, and severely punishing violations of laws and regulations (http://www.gov.cn/guowuyuan/2019-08/30/content_5425959.htm, in Chinese).

A Q & A session on illegal ASF vaccine by the head of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau/MARA and journalists was posted on the MARA website [for the URL and further details, see comment].

Viet Nam:
On 27 Aug 2019, the National Steering Committee on ASF Control released an instruction to stop throwing ASF-infected dead, sick and suspected sick pigs into the environment, violating regulations of animal health law and orders from the Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture [official letter no. 8, in Vietnamese, at http://cucthuy.gov.vn/Pages/sdgfsd.aspx].

[According to the recent (6 Sep 2019) updated report of Agricultural banking specialist Rabobank, China's pig toll has reached "critical levels", forecasting China's pork output to be slashed 25% this year to about 36 million tonnes from nearly 47 million tonnes. With every province infected since ASF was 1st detected in August 2018, China's pig herd is also expected to be cut in half from more than 400 million head to about 200 million.

Rabobank animal protein global strategist Justin Sherrard noted the country's north and northeast, the regions 1st hit, were worst impacted due to slow reaction and weak biosecurity (https://thewest.com.au/countryman/livestock/african-swine-fever-outbreak-critical-in-china-ng-b881309856z; thanks to ProMED-mail Rapporteur Kunihiko Iizuka).

China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) published on 2 Sep 2019 an interview (Q & A) with China's Head of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau, on issues related to ASF vaccines (illegally imported or locally manufactured) that have been used in China (no further data on the size of this practice is included). The official said that "they are all illegal and should be treated as fake veterinary drugs"; their import, production, distribution and use were forbidden, liable to severe punishments. At the same time, the vital importance of adhering to the strict biosecurity measures prescribed by MARA has been underlined. The official also reminded that the epidemic strains of ASF virus in China belong to genotype II. The full interview, in Chinese, is available at http://www.moa.gov.cn/gk/yjgl_1/yjcl/201909/t20190902_6327097.htm.

Notably, investigators in Madrid, Spain, published earlier this year (2019; Ref. 1) the results of a study according to which they "demonstrate that oral immunization of wild boar with a non-hemadsorbing, attenuated ASF virus of genotype II isolated in Latvia in 2017 (Lv17/WB/Rie1) conferred 92% protection against challenge with a virulent ASF virus isolate (Arm07)".

ASF virus currently circulates throughout the entire territories of China, Viet Nam and Laos, and in parts of Cambodia and Myanmar (see Pig Progress' updated interactive "ASF in Asia" map at https://tinyurl.com/y4ybahga). - Mod.AS
