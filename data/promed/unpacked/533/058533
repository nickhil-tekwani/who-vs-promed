This article is a preprint and has not been certified by peer review. It reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice.

Abstract
--------
Antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in most infected individuals 10-15 days following the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, due to the recent emergence of this virus in the human population it is not yet known how long these Ab responses will be maintained or whether they will provide protection from reinfection. Using sequential serum samples collected up to 94 days post onset of symptoms (POS) from 65 RT-qPCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, we show seroconversion in more than 95% of cases and neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when sampled beyond 8 days POS. We demonstrate that the magnitude of the nAb response is dependent upon the disease severity, but this does not affect the kinetics of the nAb response. Declining nAb titres were observed during the follow up period. Whilst some individuals with high peak ID50 (more than 10 000) maintained titres higher than 1000 longer than 60 days POS, some with lower peak ID50 had titres approaching baseline within the follow up period. A similar decline in nAb titres was also observed in a cohort of seropositive healthcare workers from Guy's and St Thomas' Hospitals. We suggest that this transient nAb response is a feature shared by both a SARS-CoV-2 infection that causes low disease severity and the circulating seasonal coronaviruses that are associated with common colds. This study has important implications when considering widespread serological testing, Ab protection against reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection.

[A ProMED post on 3 Jul 2020 (COVID-19 update (300): Korea antibodies, China asymptomatic index case, WHO 20200703.7536146) reported from South Korea that antibody was detectable 8 weeks after asymptomatic infection. The accompanying commentary noted that, "The same group from the Seoul National University Hospital demonstrated a waning immunity associated with milder clinical cases of MERS-CoV following the 2015 outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea. (Choe PG, Perera RAPM, Park WB, et al. MERS-CoV antibody responses 1 year after symptom onset, South Korea, 2015. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(7): 1079-1084. doi:10.3201/eid2307.17031; https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/7/17-0310_article).

More studies on larger samples extending beyond 8 weeks after diagnosis are needed to draw conclusions on protective antibodies following infection. But it is intriguing to see the variance in mean neutralizing antibodies disaggregated by severity of infection/clinical expression. This pre-peer review carries this out to 13+ weeks demonstrating a similar trend of higher levels of neutralizing antibodies in individuals with more severe disease, and lower with apparent waning in those with less severe disease. One question that arises is whether individuals with apparent waning immunity have been demonstrated to have an anamnestic response when challenged with the antigen. - Mod.MPP]

[The 8 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours were all imported, and it is now 7 days that no new cases have been reported from Beijing.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals and no new conversions from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 37 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 38 new cases. The newly reported cases involve 21 males and 17 females aged between 7 and 89 years and 8 had a travel history during the incubation period. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/12/P2020071200719.htm. According to a media report, from 5-11 Jul 2020, there were 173 cases confirmed of which 107 were locally transmitted (https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3092875/just-how-serious-hong-kongs-third-wave-covid-19). This 3rd wave of cases in Honk Kong follows a lifting of restrictions by 1 week.

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2. Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 62 cases with 1 new death, compared with 44 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (11 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 90 consecutive days. There were 19 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (10), Gwangju (6), Gyeonggi (3), and 43 imported cases: airport quarantine (18), Gyeonggi (8), Chungnam (4), Seoul (3), Incheon (3), Gangwon (2), Gyeongnam (2), Daegu (1), Gwangju (1), and Chungbuk (1). There were 8 provinces reporting no newly confirmed cases (compared with 10 provinces yesterday, 9 Jul 2020).

The overall impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. However, that being said, importations are also playing a major role in the country as well.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +234 cases and +9 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (11 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +188 cases and +7 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL to "download the latest data"). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (77); Emilia-Romagna (71), Calabria (28), Lazio (20), and Veneto (16) are the other provinces reporting 10 or more cases. (A note mentions that 26 of the 28 cases in Calabria were from an arriving group of migrants screened and tested on arrival). A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (8 provinces reported no new cases). Italy is now 67 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 51 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up. There are subtle signs that cases are starting to increase, but time will tell. For more detailed information on the outbreak, I suggest going to the source URL above.

Iran's Health Ministry spokeswoman says 219 993 coronavirus patients have recovered from the disease so far and been discharged from the hospital. In a press briefing on Sunday [12 Jul 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said 194 people have also died of the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 12 993. She confirmed 2186 new cases of infection with the novel coronavirus, raising the total number of cases to 257 303.

She added 3359 patients are also in severe condition of the disease. Lari noted that 1 972 207 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country.

According to Lari, West Azarbaijan, Khuzestan, Khorasan Razavi, and Mazandaran provinces are considered as "red zones" today [12 Jul 2020]. Tehran, Fars, Kohgiluyeh, and Boyer-Ahmad, Alborz, Golestan, Kerman, Hormozgan, Bushehr, and East Azarbaijan provinces are also in dangerous conditions, she added.

[The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 413 995 including 137 782 deaths, an increase from 3 355 646 cases and 137 403 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 215 924 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 12 Jul 2020 (+326 since 11 Jul 2020) including 18 670 (+3 since 11 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4613 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Ohio, and Louisiana. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1319 to 15 300. In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Arizona, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 42 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportion of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 24.6% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 12 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remains at 9% out of 40 787 857 tests performed, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 62.1% of the global newly reported cases and 66.2% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 46.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region (66 281), and Brazil reported 31.5% (45 048), Mexico 4.8% (6891), Colombia 4.8% (6803), Argentina 2.4% (3367), Peru 2.2% (3198), and Chile 1.9% (2755).

- The European region reported 8.2% of the global newly reported cases and 8.5% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 35.2% (6615) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan 9.6% (1798), Israel 7.4% (1395), Turkey 5.4% (1016), the UK 4.4% (820), Kyrgyzstan 3.8% (719), Romania 3.7% (698), Ukraine 3.6% (678), Armenia 3.1% (577), Portugal 2.9% (542), Azerbaijan 2.8% (531), and Uzbekistan 2.7% (500).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.7% of the global newly reported cases and 9.7% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 19.5% (2994) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 17.8% (2734), Pakistan 16.4% (2521), Iran 15.6% (2397), Oman 7.1% (1083), Egypt 6.0% (923), Qatar 3.2% (498), Kuwait 3.1% (478), and Palestinian Authority 3.0% (463).

- The African region reported 7.8% of the global newly reported cases and 3.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 75.5% (13 497) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 4.4% (785), Nigeria 3.7% (664), Algeria 2.6% (470), Cote d'Ivoire 3.1% (548), and Madagascar 2.4 % (435).

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.94% of the global newly reported cases and 0.28% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 60.7% (1308) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 17.3% (373), Australia 9.0% (194), Singapore 7.8% (169), South Korea 2.0% (44), and China 1.6% (35).

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 13 034 955, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. It took 4 days to go from 12 million cases to 13 million cases. The global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts. In the past 24 hours though, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (58 349) followed by India (29 108) and Brazil (25 364). It is sobering to tally the total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, and Peru), and see that they represent over half of the total cases reported globally (55.3%). A global total of 571 518 deaths have been reported, an increase of 3943 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, Chile, and Saudi Arabia. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2779 to 58 349. The number of daily newly confirmed cases is climbing rapidly in the USA. This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries and regions with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Noteworthy is that Kazakhstan is in the top 20s (number 17), having reported 1798 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. - Mod.MPP]
