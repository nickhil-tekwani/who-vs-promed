On Fri 23 Dec 2005, the Australian Government Minister for
Agriculture announced that animal health authorities were
investigating a small backyard flock in Wentworth, a small town in
southwestern New South Wales, suspected of having avian influenza.
One emaciated bird from the flock had been submitted to a state
laboratory for disease investigation and had been subjected to
routine exclusion testing for avian influenza. The bird had lesions
consistent with Marek's disease (a common endemic disease of poultry
worldwide) and was negative on a range of tests for avian influenza
except for a molecular test (PCR) that initially gave a weak
inconclusive reaction. Subsequently, repeat PCR testing on samples
from the initial bird submitted was negative.
Although all other birds in the flock were healthy, [the flock?] was
placed under quarantine as a precautionary measure while the samples
were referred to the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory at
Geelong, Victoria, and more samples were collected from the flock for
further laboratory testing. This response is consistent with
Australia's conservative approach to managing animal health risks.
The diagnostic team found no sick or dead birds in the flock on 23
Dec 2005. Blood samples and tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected
and tested at the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory. ELISA
and PCR tests on these samples were all negative for the presence of
antibodies to or viral antigen of influenza A, H5 subtype and H7
subtype. These results confirm that there is no evidence of exposure
of these birds to avian influenza, and state animal health
authorities will lift the quarantine that was temporarily imposed on
the flock.
The incident has demonstrated that Australia's national disease
surveillance and reporting arrangements are working well, regardless
of the location of suspect cases or the time of year. The case
reinforces the critical importance of surveillance, early reporting
and thorough diagnostic investigation to safeguarding Australia's
favorable animal health status.
