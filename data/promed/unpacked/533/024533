According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) another 8 cases of
Ebola have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC). Officials say the total number of cases of the deadly
haemorrhagic fever has now reached 17. The WHO says the cases have
been confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) in Atlanta.
This latest outbreak in the DRC represents the 1st major resurgence
of Ebola in many years. The death toll in the region of Kasai
Occidental over the past 5 months has now reached 170 with more than
400 sickened; however authorities say it is unclear if they all died
from Ebola as authorities have also reported the presence of typhoid
and _Shigella_ dysentery. WHO experts say some of the patients had
improved after being given antibiotics, which make it unlikely they
had Ebola as antibiotics have no impact on Ebola.
Hastily erected mobile laboratories should speed up the diagnosis of
cases, at 2 villages in southern Kasai Occidental province, where the
outbreak of the highly contagious disease was confirmed earlier this
month [September 2007]; previous test samples were being sent to the
United States. The on-site mobile labs have been loaned by the United
States and Canada. Health workers say a 2nd batch of 42 samples have
been sent to the CDC in Atlanta, 8 of which tested positive for Ebola.
Of the 17 known Ebola victims, 6 have died but the death toll from
Ebola is expected to rise. Ebola is fatal in 50 to 90 percent of
cases; it is transmitted by contact with the blood, secretions,
organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Initial symptoms
include flu-like fever and muscle pain, followed by vomiting,
diarrhoea, and in some cases bleeding from orifices; death is usually
through massive blood loss, and there is no cure or treatment.
The WHO says rapid diagnosis provided by the on-site mobile
laboratories means doctors in the affected area will be able to
quickly isolate and begin treatment of confirmed cases. The labs are
expected to be up and running within 24 hours and take from 2 to 6
hours to confirm a diagnosis.
The WHO says the number of people admitted to health centres and
hospitals during the outbreak is slowly dropping. Teams of
international experts are examining hospital records and contacting
family members in an effort to understand what caused the multiple
outbreaks of the disease. The WHO and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
have sent teams of doctors, nurses, epidemiologists, and Ebola
experts to the region along with tons of medical supplies. Radio and
television campaigns are warning people how to avoid the transmission
of Ebola, which can occur at burial ceremonies where mourners have
direct contact with corpses.
The DRC's last major Ebola outbreak struck in Kikwit in 1995, killing
245 people; Kikwit is about 300 km (186 mi) from the site of the
current outbreak. The WHO says more than 1000 people have died from
Ebola since the virus was first identified in 1976 in Sudan and the
DRC; experts believe primates which are hunted for food may carry the virus.

[At last hard information about the magnitude of the Ebola
haemorrhagic fever outbreak in the Kasai Occidental province of the
DRC is beginning to be reported. The number of fatal outcomes at
slightly over 35 percent is unusually low for Ebola outbreaks and may
reflect an enhanced standard of nursing care associated with the
influx into the region of humanitarian organisations.
It will be relevant as laboratory-confirmed data accumulates to
analyse the extent to which the involvement of other non-viral
infectious diseases (typhoid and _Shigella_ dysentery) has enhanced
the susceptibility of the local population to Ebola virus infection.
