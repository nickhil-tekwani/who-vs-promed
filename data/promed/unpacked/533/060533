One confirmed case and 2 suspect cases of mare reproductive loss syndrome
(MRLS) have been diagnosed in Alachua County, Florida, according to Dana
Zimmel of the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine. One
mare produced a septic foal on 18 Mar 2006 that was euthanatized after 2
days of intensive treatment. University of Florida pathologist John
Roberts, who worked at the University of Kentucky Livestock Disease
Diagnostic Center during the MRLS outbreaks in Kentucky in 2001-2002,
concluded that the pathology on that foal was consistent with MRLS.
Samples from an earlier abortion on the same farm were re-examined and
showed indications of MRLS; Roberts has termed that case suspect. The 3rd
case was a foal born on 26 Mar 2006, that was treated in the neonatal
intensive care unit at the University of Florida for 12 hours before being
euthanatized. Although complete histopathologic evaluation will not be
completed until [30 Mar 2006], Roberts said the pathology was consistent
with MRLS.
In the Kentucky outbreaks of 2001-2002, there was a strong association
between the presence of unusually large numbers of eastern tent
caterpillars (ETC) and MRLS. Pregnant mares experimentally fed caterpillars
typically aborted within several days. Eastern tent caterpillars were found
on the Alachua County farms and have been collected for future study.
Research has been ongoing since the Kentucky outbreak began in 2001. The
most recent information on the state of this research was published by The
Horse in December 2005. In that article, Bruce Webb, a University of
Kentucky entomologist who has been studying MRLS, said, "We can prevent
mare reproductive loss syndrome as we experienced in 2001 and 2002 by
keeping horses away from caterpillars."
Kentucky 2001-2002
------------------
Mare reproductive loss syndrome (MRLS), which historically can cause
late-term abortions, early-term fetal losses, pericarditis (heart
problems), unilateral endophthalmitis (problem in only one eye), hyphema
(blood in the eye) in foals, mouth ulcers, and laminitis -- was first seen
in Kentucky and surrounding states (and as far north as Canada) in 2001,
with a reduced incidence in 2002.
MRLS was first recognized as an outbreak of fetal deaths, foals born weak,
and late-term abortions in Kentucky on Derby weekend (the first weekend in
May) of 2001, but the outbreak was traced back to a start on 23 Apr 2001 of
that year. All breeds were affected. Because of the high number of pregnant
Thoroughbred mares in the area and the records kept on those horses,
statistics on that breed reflect what was going on in the general horse
industry. In 2001, there were 516 late-term abortions and 2998 early fetal
losses in Kentucky's Thoroughbred industry alone. There also were about 60
cases of pericarditis and 50 cases of unilateral uveitis reported in
Central Kentucky horses.
More than 30 per cent of the anticipated 2002 thoroughbred foal crop in
Kentucky was lost due MRLS. The economic cost to the state from losses
suffered by all horse breeds was estimated at nearly USD 336 million,
according to a study commissioned by Kentucky Governor Paul Patton and
conducted by the University of Louisville's Department of Equine Business.
The ETC link
------------
The cause was never absolutely defined, but most experimental models showed
a strong link of MRLS to the eastern tent caterpillar. There was a huge
hatch of caterpillars in 2001, with a large, but reduced number, that
hatched in 2002.
Terry Fitzgerald, the "tent caterpillar guru" based at the State University
of New York who helped Kentucky researchers during the 2001-2002 outbreak,
said on 28 Mar 2006 that, where there are apple and cherry trees, there
will be eastern tent caterpillars, although mid-Florida marks the far
southern extreme of the ETC's distribution. "They are common in North
Florida and Georgia," he said. It's been reported that the caterpillars
have a 10-year cycle of high numbers, then nearly disappear for a time
before building back up to high numbers. However, Fitzgerald said there is
really no basis for that report. "They have an irregular cycle," he stated.
"In one area it was 30 years between, or it could be 3 or 4 years. The
large number seen in Kentucky (in 2001-2002) might never come back,
especially since you cut down all the cherry trees (the ETC's favorite
feeding/nesting site).
The forest tent caterpillar has a general 8-10-year cycle, which is where
the ETC report might have originated. "They don't come back overnight,"
said Fitzgerald of the ETC. "It takes a while. You'll see a few nests one
year, then a few more. So you get a warning. Entomologists at universities
ought to keep track of that caterpillar since it has caused problems," he
said. "If there were records kept, you could see the trends."
Webb, of the University of Kentucky, conducted research to answer why there
aren't high tent caterpillar numbers and MRLS abortions every year. In 2001
and 2002, there were unusually large numbers of ETC nests, but that changed
dramatically between 2003 and 2005. "Our study indicates that an insect
virus that kills tent caterpillars is likely the reason," Webb said. "A
tent caterpillar baculovirus was isolated in 2003. This virus is rampant in
Central Kentucky. Between 20-80 per cent of the nests we collected in a
6-county region were infected (the virus kills the ETC) and 90 per cent of
the insects in affected nests had the virus.
Researchers showed that the caterpillars cause tiny lesions in the mare's
gastrointestinal (GI) tract and suspect that the lesions allow bacteria in
the GI tract to enter and circulate in the mare's body to somehow reach the
fetus, and ultimately cause abortion. The lesions were found by Neil
Williams of the University of Kentucky's Livestock Disease Diagnostic
Center, to have tiny setae (caterpillar hairs) in them. See setae and other
caterpillar images:

Associated bacteria
-------------------
Kyle Newman, of Venture Laboratories, tackled the challenge of identifying
levels of "suspect" bacteria for the cause of MRLS in different parts of
the mare's digestive tract. The highest levels of the types of streptococci
that are routinely seen in MRLS were found in the mouth, with about 50 per
cent of the total isolated bacteria in the mare's mouth being
MRLS-associated streptococcus. Although this same bacterial species was
present in the lower GI, it was much less common.
"In the GI tract, we're looking for a needle in a haystack that is about
the size of Chicago," he said. "There are between 500 and 1000 different
bacterial species with a total of between one and 100 trillion total
bacteria in the GI tract, and we're looking for one."
In an unexpected result of this study, the numbers of the MRLS-associated
streptococcus bacteria increased by about 10 times when mares were fed ETC.
Using a method called DNA fingerprinting, Newman assayed the bacteria from
different parts of the mare's GI tract. He determined that different
strains of bacteria were found in different gut regions and discovered a
100 per cent match between the suspect bacterial types found in the mouth
of a mare and the bacteria that infected its fetus during MRLS. The
bacteria causing MRLS "is literally coming straight from the horse's mouth
and is part of the normal (gut) flora of that animal," he said.
The obvious questions raised by this research are: Why are these particular
bacteria involved? Hhow and why do they get from the GI tract to the fetus?
and Why doesn't antibiotic therapy work in treating these infections in mares?

MRLS Prevention (recommendations developed for Kentucky).
Primary Preventive Measures
1. Minimize or eliminate exposure of pregnant mares to eastern tent
caterpillars.
2. Keep pregnant horses away from wild cherry and apple trees.
3. Frequently mow pastures grazed by pregnant mares.
4. Offer hay to horses on pasture.
Secondary Preventive Measures
1. Increase the grass-to-clover ratio in pastures.
2. Restrict time on pasture when a hard freeze is expected following a warm
period.
3. Reduce exposure of pregnant mares to endophyte-infected tall fescue.
Other Measures
1. Mycotoxin binders have been fed by some farms. If mycotoxins are
involved, this could help reduce risk. This decision should be made after
discussions with a veterinarian and/or nutritionist.
2. Correct mineral imbalances. While this is always a good idea, there is a
theory that mineral imbalances might be associated with MRLS. Again,
discuss this with your farm's veterinarian and/or nutritionist.
