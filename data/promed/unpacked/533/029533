Thai authorities plan to vaccinate more than 10 million dogs and cats within the next 6 months in reaction to a deadly rabies outbreak that has spread across the country. The country's Department of Livestock Development (DLD) sought to reassure the public at a press conference on [Wed 14 Mar 2018], saying there were enough stocks of vaccine -- more than 12.2 million doses -- to protect animals against the disease, the Bangkok Post reported.

The department's director-general Apai Suttisunk declared 37 of the country's 77 provinces as temporary rabies epidemic zones, saying that these referred to a 5 km [about 3 mile] radius of an area where an infected animal or person was reported. The department said the outbreak is "under control," Channel News Asia reported, and that it [had] trained 37 000 volunteers to administer the vaccine.

According to DLD data reported in the local news outlet The Nation, 4 people have died so far because of the outbreak, out of at least 388 [this probably refers to persons exposed to confirmed rabid animals. - Mod.AS] since [1 Jan 2018], an 88 per cent increase from the same period last year [2017], when 206 'cases' were recorded. This in itself was higher than previous records, as 102 confirmed 'cases' were recorded for the whole of 2013 [see OIE figures in the commentary. - Mod.AS].

The Nation reported that the spike in rabies cases was due to confusion among local authorities as to who was responsible for vaccinations. The DLD, however, blamed pet owners for failing to vaccinate their animals, an offense carrying a 200 baht (USD 6.40) fine, according to the BBC. More than 90 per cent of the animals infected were dogs.

According to WHO, tens of thousands of rabies-related deaths are recorded every year [worldwide], mainly in Asia and Africa. The Thai authorities aim to completely eliminate the infection by 2020.

[According to a recent -- 21 Mar 2018 -- update, a 6th human death due to rabies, since the beginning of 2018, was recorded in Thailand on Sun 18 Mar 2018, in the province Buriram. Rabies killed 14 people last year [2017], up from 11 in 2016.

The situation of rabies in Bangkok since 2013 is as follows: 31 rabid dogs in 2013; 47 in 2014; 22 in 2015; 30 in 2016 and 47 in 2017 (see, in French, at https://www.thailande-fr.com/sante/61181-rage-en-thailande-un-sixieme-deces-dans-la-province-de-buriram. transl. SB).

According to Thailand's annual reports to the OIE, the numbers of rabies cases in animals, since 2015, are as follows: 2015 - 327; 2016 - 612; 2017 - 792. - Mod.AS]

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) reports that 5 people have contracted rabies since December last year [2017].

Patients with the disease were recorded in Limpopo, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu Natal (2 cases) and the Eastern Cape. Another suspected case was reported in the Free State in December [2017]. The patient was exposed to a domestic cat before falling ill. In this case, laboratory confirmation was not possible due to the lack of appropriate specimens.

Rabies in humans can be prevented through post-exposure prophylaxis.

The 6 reported rabies cases involved exposure to rabid domestic dogs (3 cases) and domestic cats (3 cases). Other animals may also become infected with and transmit the virus to humans, but such reports are less common.

[3] Viet Nam - rabies vaccine hesitancy and deaths among pregnant and breastfeeding women
Date: Fri 2 Mar 2018

http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6708a4


Citation: Nguyen HT, Tran CH, Dang AD, et al. Rabies vaccine hesitancy and deaths among pregnant and breastfeeding women -- Vietnam, 2015-2016.

Summary
1. What is already known about this topic?
Human rabies deaths are preventable through prompt administration of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with rabies immune globulin and rabies vaccine after exposure to rabid animals. Rabies PEP is safe for use among pregnant and breastfeeding women; studies have found no increased risk for spontaneous abortions, premature births, or fetal abnormalities among pregnant women after receiving PEP.

2. What is added by this report?
During 2015-2016, 6 probable cases of rabies were reported among pregnant and breastfeeding women in Vietnam. None of the 6 patients sought PEP after exposure. In each case, families reported the patients' fear of risk to the fetus or breastfed child as the primary barrier to the women receiving PEP.

3. What are the implications for public health practice?
One strategy aimed at improving health care-seeking behavior and PEP acceptance is training village health workers to educate community members, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, regarding treatment options for rabies and the safety of PEP. As more countries expand access to PEP, special attention should focus on addressing vaccine hesitancy, particularly among pregnant and breastfeeding women, and improving education of community health workers.

The Ministry of Health reports the discovery of rabies in a stray dog at the entrance to the Tel Dan nature reserve in the Upper Galilee.

The ministry requests that anyone who may have been in contact with the infected animal or a stray animal in the area or who has animals that may have come into contact, urgently reach the nearest health office or hospital emergency room to consider preventive treatment. The ministry warned hikers and other vacationers in the area to be alert.

[According to a circular distributed by Israel's Veterinary Services on Tue 20 Mar 2018, the stray dog described above attacked, on Sun 18 Mar 2018, 3 visitors in the Tel Dan Nature reserve, bordering Lebanon (map at https://tinyurl.com/ycwzqs3x). The attacked people killed the animal and sent it to the national rabies laboratory at Beit-Dagan, where rabies was confirmed. They were referred to the public health authorities for post exposure treatment. During 2017, 3 rabid animals were identified within the same nature reserve, all jackals; the most recent case was reported in August 2017. Neighbouring Lebanon has recently reported a rabies case in a dog to the OIE; its earlier reported case was submitted in 1995. The actual circulation of the virus in that country is clearly reflected in Israel's rabies map of 2015 at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/kalevet_2015/PublishingImages/rabiesmap272016.jpg.

The current case is Israel's 38th case in animals since the start of 2018, and the 1st dog among them; the others were 31 jackals and 6 calves (in separate locations; see the 2018 rabies map at http://www.moag.gov.il/vet/Yechidot/Machon/maabada_kalevet/airueim%20kalevet/Documents/mapa_kalevet_19_03.jpg).

The major rabies event in Israel, involving mainly jackals in the northern valleys, started in October 2017 and does not seem to have been controlled yet, in spite of reports on enhanced distribution of vaccine baits for wildlife. For further details, please refer to previous postings.

It may be assumed that the number of post-exposure treatments in humans since the start of the current event is higher than in previous years, but official figures, since October 2017, are still not available. - Mod.AS]
