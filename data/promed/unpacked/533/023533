A pesticide, suspected of increasing the risk of Parkinson's disease, is widely used in Israel despite the fact that the health and environmental protection ministries have recommended halting its use. In Israel paraquat, an herbicide is widely used in vineyards and citrus groves, and in potato and cotton fields.

A few months ago the Health Ministry prepared an opinion recommending that use of the substance be stopped. Not only does it poison those using it, wrote the ministry, but also cited studies on laboratory animals and among agricultural workers suggesting a link between paraquat and the onset of Parkinson's disease. In laboratory animals exposure to the substance caused behavioral changes that were similar to the symptoms of Parkinson's in human beings.

In a study conducted in the United States it was found that workers using paraquat were 2.5 times more likely to contract Parkinson's.

The Environmental Protection Ministry wrote that the substance should not be used due to its very serious and damaging effects on health, including many cases of death. A study conducted in the Negev found a link between the percentage of Parkinson's patients in the communities and their proximity to agricultural areas where substances such as paraquat were used. In these communities there may be up to 50 percent more Parkinson's sufferers.

The findings were presented Dr. Yair Zlotnik of the neurology department of Soroka Medical Center in Be'er Sheva, at a professional discussion on the issue held last week [week ending Sun 29 Apr 2018] by the Environmental Protection Ministry. Zlotnik stressed that these findings don't necessarily prove a causal connection between the disease and use of the substance, but demonstrates a connection between living near these agricultural areas and an increase in morbidity. Zlotnik said that the limitations of the study include an absence of precise information about which pesticides were used, and an absence of information about the patients' ethnic origin and history. Parkinson's can also have genetic causes, which is why the patients' origin is very important.

The Agriculture Ministry noted the difficulty in discontinuing use of the substance due to an absence of suitable alternatives.

The Agriculture Ministry responded that "the ministry is reexamining 50 active ingredients in over 100 pesticides that are presently approved for use. In this context the ministry is examining the advantages and disadvantages of paraquat, which is approved in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia and Japan; is very helpful against a wide variety of weeds; and disintegrates quickly after use, without leaving any vestiges in the plant. The ministry has not yet made a decision, and the attempt to influence its opinion via the media is wrong and unprofessional."

Paraquat was banned a decade ago in the European Union.

In the United States the substance can be used only by workers who have received special training. In Israel there is no similar restriction on the agricultural use of the substance.

[Paraquat exposure is accepted by many as a major component of Parkinson's disease (PD) epidemiology.

In 2011, a US National Institutes of Health study showed a link between paraquat use and Parkinson's disease in farm workers. [ Tanner, C. M.; Kamel, F.; et al. (2011). "Rotenone, Paraquat, and Parkinson's Disease". Environmental Health Perspectives. 119 (6): 866-872. doi:10.1289/ehp.1002839. PMC 3114824, PMID 21269927.] A co-author of the paper said that paraquat increases production of certain oxygen derivatives that may harm cellular structures, and that people who used paraquat, or other pesticides with a similar mechanism of action, were more likely to develop Parkinson's. Paraquat-induced toxicity in rats has also been linked to Parkinson's-like neurological degenerative mechanisms. A study by the Buck Institute for Research on Aging showed a connection between exposure to paraquat and iron in infancy and mid-life Parkinson's in laboratory mice. A 2013 meta-analysis published in Neurology found that 'exposure to paraquat was associated with about a 2-fold increase in risk' of Parkinson's disease [Pezzoli, Gianni; Cereda, Emanuele (2013). "Exposure to pesticides or solvents and risk of Parkinson disease". Neurology. 80 (22): 2035-2041. doi:10.1212/wnl.0b013e318294b3c8.] Paraquat is structurally similar to MPP+, a known fast-acting inducer of Parkinson's disease in primate brains. The chloride of MPP+ was sold under the trade name Cyperquat. [Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraquat].

Paraquat, an herbicide widely used in agriculture for better crop production, is an environmental toxin and causes oxidative stress-induced systemic damages in plants, animals and humans. Epidemiological studies report that paraquat toxicity is related to the onset of parkinsonism in humans. Animal experimentations indicate that paraquat toxicity causes the cellular and molecular changes associated with parkinsonism. Experimental evidences show that blood-brain-barrier limits the paraquat entry in brain of primates and humans and therefore, the doubts remain for a direct paraquat-induced parkinsonism in human. To define a remedial measure, extensive studies are required on the cause and prognosis of Parkinson's disease induced by such environmental toxicant [Trends in research in paraquat-induced Parkinsonism, http://ijpas.org/upload/15-08-2017-1502813556.pdf]

Though there is some caution in research findings, the general opinion is that Paraquat exposure does add significantly to PD incidence; and thus its prohibition in many countries. - Mod.MHJ
