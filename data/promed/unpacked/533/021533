An epidemic of rabies is under way in Zhytomyr Oblast [region]. The
specialists estimate that about 7000 foxes are present in the oblast.
They consider that if the fox population is not reduced [to a third of
the current size], a rabies epidemic becomes unavoidable. Rabid foxes
lose caution and fear; they often get close to human dwellings and
have already infected more than 2 dozen household pets.

The local authorities have decided to pay 50 hryven [hryvnia,
Ukrainian currency; 50 hryvnia = USD 6.31] to any hunter who kills a
fox. They say that it is cheaper to pay that amount of money for a
killed fox than to deal with the consequences of the epidemic. So far,
no payments have been made.

[Since 2007, Ukraine has been implementing oral vaccination of
wildlife, namely foxes. A 1st-hand description of the project has been
included in ProMED-mail's posting 20091018.3587.

It will be interesting to obtain the view of the relevant Ukrainian
authorities about the current news, apparently indicating shortcomings
in reducing or eliminating the incidence of rabies in foxes. - Mod.AS]
