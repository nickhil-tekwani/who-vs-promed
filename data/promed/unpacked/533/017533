Organization (IVO), Ministry of
Jihad-e-Agriculture, Tehran:
Report date: 15 Feb 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: 1st occurrence
of a listed disease or infection in a country or
zone/compartment.
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 13 Feb 2006.
Date of start of the event: 2 Feb 2006.
Clinical disease: yes.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Details of outbreak:

*NA: not applicable
On 2 Feb 2006, within the framework of the Avian
Influenza Passive Surveillance Plan in place for
wild birds in Gilan province, a few deaths were
reported among swans in 2 marshes (Selkeh and
Espand) at Somaesara (Anzali wetland).
Immediately, all the relevant activities were
implemented in accordance with OIE guidelines and
recommendations, and all of the indigenous birds
in 6 villages considered to be epidemiological
units at risk (i.e. within a 2-km radius) were
destroyed and their owners compensated by the
IVO. Samples taken from the indigenous birds were
tested as follows: sera were tested using
hemagglutination inhibition (H5 and H9 avian
influenza and Newcastle disease) and tissue
samples were tested by RT-PCR, all with negative
results. Tissue samples taken from swans were
sent to the OIE Reference Laboratory for avian
influenza and Newcastle disease in Padova, Italy
for virological tests (see details below).
Diagnosis (confirmatory testing):
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were
performed: OIE Reference Laboratory for avian
influenza and Newcastle disease in Padova, Italy
Species examined: swan samples (tissue and sera)
Diagnostic tests used: Real-time PCR(1) for gene H5.
Date: 13 Feb 2006
Results: Positive
Diagnostic tests used: Hemagglutination
inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition tests
Date: 13 Feb 2006
Results: Positive for subtype H5N1*.
Diagnostic tests used: Sequence analysis.
Date: 13 Feb 2006
Results: Amino acid sequence at cleavage site
indicates a highly pathogenic avian influenza
profile.
* In addition, one sample was positive for H9 hemagglutinin (titre=1:64)
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures undertaken:
- preventive culling of domestic birds within a
2-km radius around the marshes of Selkeh and
Espand;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s).
An epidemiological investigation was carried out
as a qualitative risk assessment in the area
where dead and sick swans were found.
Protection and surveillance zones were established.
All the poultry holdings (native, industrial)
around the wetland have been identified,
appropriate on-farm biosecurity measures have
been implemented, movements of poultry products
are under control, check point stations are in
place for the control of illegal movement,
disease awareness among owners has been
increased, assembly of live birds at markets and
other gatherings is prohibited and under control.
Hunting of birds has been prohibited in the
country for the past 6 months, and transport,
dispatch and movement of risk material is
prohibited. An 8th statement was distributed by
IVO to update the media on the current bird flu
situation.
Vaccination prohibited: yes.
Other details/comments:
One of the most significant changes in the
ecosystem of Anzali wetland is that the
population of swans has increased from 8 birds in
2005 to 3000 birds in 2006.
Final report: no.

[If you have gotten this far in the posting, I suppose you should be rewarded
by a short commentary, so this will be brief.
1st, several of the European isolates were from mute swan (_Cygnus olor_); for
more information about and pictures of mute swans, see
<http://www.wildlifeinformation.org/Subdirectories_for_Search2/SampleSpecies/Cy
gnus_olor/Cygnus_olor.html>.
Secondly, the OIE Avian Influenza reference laboratory at Weybridge sequenced
the isolate from Greece and found the PQGERRRKKRGLF nucleotide sequence, which
has been identified in earlier reports as being similar to isolates from
Croatia, Qinghai lake (China), Turkey and Romania. See
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_47.HTM#Sec4>.
Finally, more detail on the species involved, the tests being done and the
control measures being used in Azerbaijan would be greatly appreciated.
