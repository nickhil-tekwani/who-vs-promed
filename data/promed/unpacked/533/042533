The number of cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in the
Yaroslavl oblast increased by a third last year [2009] in comparison with
2008. There were 118 cases last year, and the high rate of infection has
continued into this year.

During the 1st week of 2010, 7 new cases of HFRS have been detected. The
reason for the high morbidity is thought to be a consequence of the mild
winter weather and the abundance of rodents. The rodents have congregated
near human dwellings, especially in holiday areas. Often people contract
infection when picnicking in the countryside. The rodent vectors of HFRS
contaminate the environment with their droppings. Humans can become
infected by inhaling contaminated dust or by consuming contaminated food.

The public health authorities have stated that the incidence of infection
is expected to decline throughout December 2009 and January 2010. However,
the epidemic situation is serious, and rodent control measures have been
inadequate in recent times.

Several years ago, a state-funded rodent control programme was in force,
but that programme has lapsed. It is expected that local administrations
will take over this responsibility and initiate their own programmes. The
aim will be to exterminate the rodent vector by all possible means. In the
meantime, to avoid infection, residents and visitors to the countryside
should wear gloves and respirators when cleaning surfaces, and wash their
hands frequently.

[HFRS is endemic in the Yaroslavl oblast. The incidence increases during
the cold season, as the rodents move closer to humans habitations looking
for food. Climate warming and financial cuts in rodent control measures
have contributed to the increase of HFRS morbidity in many regions of
Russia. - Mod.NP

This article is accompanied by a rather endearing photograph of a rodent,
which may moderate the intention to exterminate these animals.

The location of the Yaroslavl oblast can be seen in the map of Russia at

The Yaroslavl oblast lies in the upper Volga River basin. Most of the
oblast is a low plain traversed by the Volga River. The oblast's natural
vegetation is forest, with spruce, pine, oak, maple, and ash, with many
patches of swamp, and with floodplain meadows along the rivers. Agriculture
is dominated by dairying, and the region is noted for its cheeses, flax,
and oats. - Mod.CP]
