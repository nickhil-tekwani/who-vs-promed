Horse liver might find its way into processed treats and canned foods, but
the treats in question are dried chicken breast treats. For years, the only
manufacturer of these dried chicken breast treats was Hillbilly Smokehouse
with their "Cluckers" brand. Cluckers are not in question as they are made
in the USA and are USDA inspected.
In the last 3 years, many "knock-off" brands have become available and
almost all are made in China. These are the treats in question. Wal-Mart
has officially and voluntarily removed Bestro chicken jerky from it's
shelves, PetSmart has voluntarily removed Smokehouse brand chicken jerky
treats from their shelves. The SKUs of the products removed from PetSmart's
shelves and a picture of one of the offending products can be found at the
following link:
<http://www.itchmo.com/smokehouse-brand-dog-treats-pulled-from-petsmart-shelves-2869>.
If you look at the picture, you will see that it would very hard to
disguise horse livers as these types of treats, although they could be
contaminated with something else. Salmonella has been a problem with these
types of treats in the past. Is there any likelihood that avian influenza
could also be a problem with these?
I have never considered them safe because they splinter into sharp shards
when dogs bite them.

[ProMED-mail posted the entire article from the American Veterinary Medical
Association (AVMA) in the original posting, 20070915.3067. For a reminder

But Ms Lasswell asks a valid question regarding contamination with some
bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli, or even a viral product such as
avian influenza.
The FDA is investigating these treats. Likewise it should be noted that
AVMA has posted information with regard to Bravo issuing a recall because
of Salmonella and Listeria contamination. The link is
