Desserts from an Iowa-based pizza chain have been linked to _E. coli_ infection in 9 states, according to federal officials. The outbreak started in December 2015, mainly among people who had eaten at the chain's restaurants, according to Brittany Behm, a spokeswoman for the CDC. Behm said Wed 16 Mar 2016, that 13 people became ill. 9 of the people said they recently had eaten at Pizza Ranches, she said. 2 children, in Kansas and Nebraska, suffered kidney failure and had to be hospitalized. They have since recovered and there were no fatalities, Behm said.

Pizza Ranch cooperated with the investigation, which wound up focusing on a dry dough mix used to make desserts, Behm said. No bacteria were found in remaining samples of the dough mix, but the outbreak ended after the company stopped using the mix and a similar product by early February 2016, she said.

"We removed our Skillet Dough mix immediately from use in response to information suggesting that this product was a possible common factor in the illnesses and subsequently expanded this product withdrawal to include our Original Dough mix," Pizza Ranch CEO Ryan Achterhoff said in a statement Wed 16 Mar 2016

David Werning, a spokesman for the Iowa Department of Inspections and Appeals, said Iowa officials picked up samples from 2 Pizza Ranch restaurants then forwarded them to federal investigators. No _E. coli_ bacteria were found in those samples, he said.

Behm said the illnesses happened in Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Nebraska, New Jersey, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Minnesota, which had 5 cases, was the only state with more than 1, she said. The company is based in Orange City, Iowa, and has 190 restaurants in 13 states.

According to Achterhoff the bacteria originated "from an outsider supplier." He said the company ran over 40 _E. coli_ tests on different products and did not find the bacteria in any of those tested.

Dr Patricia Quinlisk, medical director of the Iowa Department of Public Health, said the Iowa case involved an adult who did not require hospitalization. Quinlisk said state law would not allow her to comment on the business involved, but she said it is unusual for _E. coli_ to be found in a dry baking mix. She noted that the bacteria generally are associated with meat or with leafy vegetables that have been fertilized with manure.

However, there have been _E. coli_ outbreaks associated with other food items. For example, scores of people were sickened with the bacterium in 2009, in an outbreak blamed on tainted Nestle Toll House cookie dough.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have noted your alert on the outbreak with interest. I am a research scientist at the James Hutton Institute, UK, working on the molecular basis to interactions between _E. coli_/_Salmonella_ and fresh produce. We collected soil and plant samples from a barley trial and managed to isolate generic _E. coli_ without too much problem (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/lam.12180/abstract).

Therefore maybe we shouldn't be surprised to find EHEC in another cereal crop.

[The dough mentioned in the previous post regarding this outbreak of EHEC is clearly not pizza dough but rather a dough used to make desserts. No microbiological evidence of contamination of this product is available.
