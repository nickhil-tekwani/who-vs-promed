Typhoid fever increases in Almaty
---------------------------------
Sixteen cases of typhoid fever had been registered in Almaty, said
Gulzhahan Karimova, Deputy Director of the Almaty Sanitary and Epidemiology
Station, last Thursday. Medical workers are now investigating the causes of
the outbreak of the disease.
According to Karimova, the fact that all cases have been registered within
a short period of time, just 10-15 days, has aroused "particular alarm"
among medical workers. She said the sanitary and epidemiology station is
now examining shops, water pipelines and sewage systems where the patients
live.
Karimova did not name the infection hotbed saying they had not obtained
appropriate analyses results at the moment. But she supposed that people
had caught typhoid fever by consuming some "the same food stuff." Should
the typhoid fever bacteria be in water, the number of patients would have
been "much higher."
Over the last several years, 5-6 cases have been registered every year in
Almaty, said Karimova. She associates the increased number of cases with
the "dubious quality" of imported products appearing in the Almaty markets.
According to National Statistics Agency data, 29 typhoid fever cases have
been registered in Kazakhstan over the last 9 months. Fourteen cases were
registered over the same period last year.

Typhoid outbreak in Almaty on wane
----------------------------------
The outbreak of typhoid fever in Almaty was rather surprising since Almaty
has never been classified as an unsafe city in terms of sanitary and
epidemiology parameters. Amir Karabekov, Chief Doctor of the Almaty
Clinical Infection Hospital and Chief Infection Doctor of Kazakhstan has
commented on the situation.
"To date we have registered in Almaty 18 proven typhoid fever cases among
adults and 5 cases among children. The condition of all patients is close
to satisfactory. Several patients who have been recently delivered to the
hospital have the disease in full swing. Their are in an average-poor
condition. But all of them are recovering. We have all the necessary
medicines. The outbreak of typhoid in Almaty is on the decline: we have not
registered any new cases over the past week. The Almaty City Hall responded
quickly to the situation and continues to provide support to medical
workers. Currently, district doctors visit every home in residential areas
to reveal all cases of fever and send such people for laboratory tests.
"Unlike plague, cholera and tuberculosis, typhoid fever is exclusively a
human disease. Patients in all stages of the disease are the source of
infection. People who have recovered from typhoid continue to release
typhoid bacteria for 10-15 days after recovery. It is very difficult to
expose such typhoid carriers. If such people work in dairy or food
producing enterprises or have access to water supply sources and do not
observe sanitary requirements, there would be a new outbreak. In water,
milk and meat the typhoid bacillus not only multiplies but also
accumulates. It is very difficult to locate it given the current boom in
street catering and uncontrollable sale of food products, which was proven
by this outbreak. According to the Almaty Sanitary and Epidemiology
Station, the hotbed of the infection has not yet been found.
"It is very difficult to receive true information from the patients because
the incubation of typhoid lasts 2-3 weeks, and most of them do not remember
what and where they eat at all time. This outbreak has clearly-determined
"social" roots: most patients are unemployed, some of them trade in the
bazaars and even live there. The best safeguard from typhoid, like from any
other intestinal infection, is purity. Doctors think that the infection
source was food, most likely dairy products. But they still cannot tell
exactly. So everyone should be extremely cautious - do not drink raw water
and non-boiled milk, do not buy food products that cannot be thermally
treated on the streets, and observe personal hygiene norms."
