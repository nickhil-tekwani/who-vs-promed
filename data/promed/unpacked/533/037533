Chronic wasting disease is here. We knew it was just a matter of
time. North Dakota has long been an island, free of chronic wasting
disease (CWD) in the deer herd. Surrounding states and provinces have
dealt with the problem to one degree or another. States like Colorado
and Wyoming have had widespread problems with CWD since the disease
was first identified in the 1960s.

North Dakota is no longer CWD free. Last fall [2009] a deer hunter in
unit 3F2 (west side of Missouri River, bordering South Dakota) killed
a mule deer buck that appeared to be sick. He reported it and test
samples were taken of the deer and tested along with the state's
regular testing protocol that included 3000 samples taken this year
[2010].

Last week [week of 15 Mar 2010], after testing only 2/3 of those
samples, the test result from that sick mule deer came up positive
for CWD. The rest of the samples will be tested over the next month.
