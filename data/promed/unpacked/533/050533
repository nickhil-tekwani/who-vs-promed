Infectious disease now confirmed among captive Calico mustangs
--------------------------------------------------------------
Writing in her 'Art and Horses' blog today [30 Mar 2010], artist,
videographer, author, and wild horse activist Laura Leigh reports that
a highly contagious disease known as "pigeon fever," which can cause
lameness, fever, lethargy, and deep abscesses, is running through the
captive wild horse population at the "Broken Arrow" feedlot near
Fallon, Nevada. The BLM's [Bureau of Land Management] weeklong failure
to issue daily updates on the condition of the horses now begins to
make a lot of sense.

Alarmingly, the BLM is making no effort whatsoever to isolate sick
horses to prevent the spread of the disease, virtually ensuring that
many more horses will contract it.

According to Ms. Leigh: "When asked if the cases were confined to the
horses gathered from a specific area and isolated in the pens sorted
by area gathered, he (BLM facility manager John Neill) replied, 'No,
we've been moving horses around.'"

The BLM's cavalier approach to a potentially serious situation is not
only unconscionable, it defies good veterinary practice. According to
Dr Andrea Torres, a veterinarian and microbiology resident who
conducted a study of pigeon fever in Colorado in 2000-2001:

"Because this disease is so highly contagious, it is very important
that veterinarians accurately diagnose these cases to tailor treatment
and control. Infected horses should be isolated, the abscesses
properly treated, and the drainage properly disposed of. The area
where the infected horse is kept must be properly cleaned and
completely disinfected because this is a very hardy bacterium. Pest
control is extremely important."

In light of the fact that the 1800+ horses being held at the Fallon
facility are already under tremendous stress as a result of being
stampeded from their homes, fed forage to which they were
unaccustomed, and subsequently run through squeeze chutes for
vaccinations, worming, and freeze-branding, their immune systems have
been severely compromised. Without extreme vigilance and proper care
and containment, many more of the Calico horses will be stricken by
pigeon fever. There is no excuse for that.

[Pigeon fever has many names, but ultimately it affects horses not
birds. Borrowing from this moderator's comment in ProMED-mail posting
Pigeon fever, equine - USA (OR) 20071018.3408 (see reference for full
discussion):

Pigeon fever, pigeon breast, breastbone fever, dryland distemper,
dryland strangles, false strangles, or false distemper are the names
that this disease -- caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium
pseudotuberculosis_ -- are most frequently known by. Geographically,
it was at one time considered to be a disease of California, where it
is regarded as endemic. However, it is much more widespread now,
especially in the western states of the US, but it has a worldwide
distribution. It is a seasonal disease, usually appearing in late fall
but can appear sporadically at any time of year.

The signs of pigeon fever can also initially resemble those of other
diseases such as strangles. Sometimes the only initial signs are
lameness and a reluctance to move. It can strike a horse of any age,
sex, or breed, but usually attacks young adult animals. There is a low
incidence in foals.

It has also been diagnosed in cattle, and a similar disease affects
sheep and goats. The disease is not transmissible to humans, although
humans can carry the infectious agent on shoes, clothing, hands, or
barn tools and transfer it to another animal.

Clinical signs include lameness, fever, lethargy, and weight loss and
usually is accompanied by very deep abscesses and multiple sores along
the chest, midline, and groin area and, sometimes, the back. Abscesses
can also develop internally.

The disease is called pigeon fever because infected animals often
develop abscesses in their pectoral muscles, which swell and resemble
a pigeon's chest. Although the disease is considered seasonal, with
most cases occurring in early fall, a number of cases have been
confirmed during winter months and other times of the year.

The causative bacteria live in the soil and can enter the animal's
body through wounds, broken skin, or through mucous membranes.
Additionally, some researchers believe pigeon fever may be transmitted
by flies.

Of the types of disease (external abscesses, internal abscesses, or
limb infection [ulcerative lymphangitis]), the ulcerative lymphangitis
is the most common form worldwide and rarely involves more than one
leg at a time. Usually, multiple small, draining sores develop above
the fetlock.

The most common form of the disease in the United States is external
abscessation, which often forms deep in the muscles and can be very
large. Usually, it appears in the pectoral region, the ventral
abdomen, and the groin area. After spontaneous rupture, or lancing,
the wound will exude liquid, light tan-colored, malodorous pus.

Internal abscesses can occur and are very difficult to treat. The most
common forms are external abscess and lymphangitis, with the prognosis
of a full recovery being generally good. - Mod.TG]
