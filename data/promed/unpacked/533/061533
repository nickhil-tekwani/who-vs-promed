World animal health officials are monitoring the spread of an
outbreak of the equine venereal disease dourine currently ongoing in
Italy. The outbreak began in late May [2011], according to a report
from the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID).

To date 6 horses have now tested positive for the disease in 2
different locations in Italy. Initially confined to the island of
Sicily, the disease was also detected on the Italian mainland. One
horse was euthanized as a result of the disease. A total of 20 horses
between the 2 locations are thought to be at risk of contracting
dourine.

The WAHID indicated that all affected horses are currently under
quarantine and movement restrictions have been implemented in the
surrounding areas.

Not a disease present in the United States, dourine is caused by the
protozoan _Trypanosoma equiperdum_ and prompts affected horses to
display such clinical signs as paralysis, genital swelling, the
development of plaque on the skin, emaciation, and neurologic
deficits. There is currently no vaccine available, treatment options
are limited, and the mortality rate associated with the disease is
high.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr Louis Touratier, coordinator, OIE ad
hoc Group on Non Tsetse Transmitted Animal Trypanosomoses Diagnosis
(NTTAT) for the following complementary information:

"The NTTAT Group shall follow the evolution of the dourine outbreaks
in Italy with great care.

"The following 3 countries have commendably enhanced their efforts in
detecting and controlling this "old" disease:

- Ethiopia, with its donkey census of 5 million animals where dourine
is a national problem in donkeys, horses, and mules. This has been
supported by the Flemish research fund (6 years of activities with
multiple publications) and cooperation of the British "Donkey
Sanctuary";

- Namibia and Botswana, with Italian cooperation.

"The disease is also present in Asia, where the reporting level
deserves to be improved. However, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Mongolia
report the disease presence as 'suspected'."
