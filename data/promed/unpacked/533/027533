Disease trackers in Massachusetts and Maine are investigating 2 cases of a rare and severe tick-borne illness, providing new evidence of the suffering that can be inflicted by ticks and prompting warnings that the threat can persist into December.

Investigators suspect that the infections were caused by Powassan virus or a related virus, which can spawn headaches, vomiting, confusion, seizures, memory loss, and long-term neurological problems in those who survive the infection. The virus is believed to be fatal in 10 to 15 percent of those who are exposed.

Blood tests show that a Maine woman who died last week was infected with the virus. Health officials said it appears the woman, from mid-coast Maine, had not been traveling and likely was infected locally.

[Human Powassan (POW) virus infections have been recognized in the United States, Canada, and Russia. In the United States, cases of POW virus disease have been reported primarily from northeastern states and the Great Lakes region, including Maine and Massachusetts. Cases of Powassan virus infection cases occur primarily in the late spring, early summer, and mid-fall, when ticks are most active.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (http://www.cdc.gov/powassan/): Powassan (POW) virus is transmitted to humans by infected ticks. About 50 cases of POW virus disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the northeast and Great Lakes region. Signs and symptoms of infection can include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory loss. Long-term neurological problems may occur. There is no specific treatment, but people with severe POW virus illnesses often need to be hospitalized to receive respiratory support, intravenous fluids, or medications.

Reports of Powassan virus infection seem to have been more frequent in the current year (2013), and this report argues that this may perhaps be a consequence of greater prevalence of a strain of the virus adapted to transmission by deer ticks. - Mod.CP]
