Warning against citrus fruit from South Africa
----------------------------------------------
The EU [European Union] Committees of farmer organisations (COPA) and rural cooperatives (COGECA) warn of citrus fruit from South Africa.

According to industry representatives, the highly contagious black spot disease was found this week in a total of 5 import inspections. COPA and COGECA therefore called on the European Commission [EC] to stop the importation of citrus from South Africa urgently, for reasons of plant health and also because there are currently no control measures available against the disease.

Secretary-General Pekka Pesonen pointed out the economic and social importance of citrus cultivation in southern Europe. So far, citrus black spot does not occur in the EU. The EC has repeatedly called on South African authorities for measures to prevent introduction of the disease into Europe.

Certification of freedom from black spot is already required for citrus imports from South Africa. No comments were available on the possibility of an import ban, but the EC may implement limited countermeasures against imports from black spot regions.

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Guignardia citricarpa_ is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape and colour depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit may not show visible symptoms while on the tree. However, characteristic lesions may develop in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. Black spot causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop and disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections) and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season, and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation and pathogen exclusion.

The threat of CBS introduction has been an issue in Europe for several years. The disease has been included in the A1 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). CBS has also recently been introduced into the USA by unknown means (2010; ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183), and this further illustrates the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _G. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.
