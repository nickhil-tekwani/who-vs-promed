First identification of tick-borne encephalitis in Denmark outside of
Bornholm, August 2009. By: A Fomsgaard1, C B Christiansen2, R Bodker3

The incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in Scandinavia is
increasing and spreading geographically. Following 2 clinical cases
of TBE hospitalised after tick bites in northern Zealand, Denmark,
specific IgM and IgG antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus
(TBEV) were demonstrated in acute serum samples of these patients.
TBEV was identified by RT-PCR in ticks collected from the same
location. This is the 1st report of TBEV in _Ixodes ricinus_ leading
to clinical cases in Denmark outside of Bornholm island.

Background
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is caused by TBE virus (TBEV), a member
of genus _Flavivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_. The incidence of TBE
has been increasing in neighbouring countries of Denmark (Sweden and
Germany) over the past years and mirrors the geographic spread and
increased number of ticks [1,2]. The vector for the European subtype,
TBEV-Eu, is _Ixodes ricinus_ (the common tick) that is seen in most
of Europe and is the dominant tick species in Denmark (greater than
90 percent). In Denmark, TBE is endemic only on the island of
Bornholm in the Baltic sea, with a stable annual incidence of 4 per
100 000 inhabitants [3]. Three serum samples from roe deer from
Zealand examined during the 2002-2003 hunting season were found to be
antibody-positive for the TBE-complex of viruses [4]. However, a
cross-reaction with Louping ill virus [a distinct species, mainly
affecting sheep, in the mammalian tick-borne virus group of the genus
_Flavivirus_ - Mod.CP] could not be excluded. Importantly, no
clinical cases of TBE have been reported or TBEV detected outside Bornholm.

Clinical case and virological analysis
In July 2009, a man in his 40s developed fever and other
influenza-like symptoms as well as arthritis about one week after
receiving 4 tick bites in his own garden. The patient is a forest
worker living in a house in the forest. After about 4 days of
recovery, he was hospitalised 2 weeks after the bites with symptoms
of meningoencephalitis and mononuclear cells in the spinal fluid.
Serum samples from the time of admission to hospital at the beginning
of the encephalitis were negative for _Borrelia_ but had positive IgM
(optical density (OD450nm) 1190, cut-off 224) and IgG (OD450nm 695,
cut-off 224) titres to TBEV as measured by a validated ELISA
(Enzygnost, Siemens) [5]. Spinal fluid was negative in the PCR for
herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, varicella zoster virus and TBEV.
At the time of publication of this report, the patient was recovering
but continued to feel dizzy.

The patient reported about a man in his 30s who was working in a
kindergarten in the same forest about 500 meters away, who had a
similar unidentified viral meningoencephalitis after tick bites the
year before (October 2008). When re-examining this 2nd patients'
acute serum from 2008, the antibody test was positive for anti-TBEV
IgM (OD 609, cut-off 224) and IgG (OD 1109, cut-off 243), and a
recent follow-up convalescent serum (taken approximately one year
later) was still IgG-positive (OD 942, cut-off 243) but IgM-negative
for TBEV [5]. He was therefore re-diagnosed as a TBE patient.

A TBEV antibody plaque neutralisation test (kindly performed by Dr.
Matthias Niedrig, Robert Koch-Institute, Berlin) using TBEV K23
according to Reinhardt et al. [6] was positive on the convalescent
serum but not on the acute serum drawn during the encephalitis from
both patients.

Environmental analysis
Ticks were collected by "flagging" (dragging of a 1x1 metre cloth
through the grass) at the edge of the forest surrounding the forest
worker's garden, identified by species and sorted into 3 pools of
approximately 50 nymphs, 30 adult females and 25 adult males,
respectively. Ticks were also collected (9 pools containing a total
of 219 larvae and 62 nymphs and adults) at 3 different sites in an
adjacent forest with the highest density of deer in Denmark. RNA was
extracted from the ticks using MagNA Pure total NA kit (ABI), and a
real-time RT-PCR was run in a quality-controlled routine PCR
diagnostic laboratory using specific primers and probes as described
in [7]. The PCR is specific for viruses of the TBEV complex as
validated by the European Network for Diagnostic of Imported Viral
Diseases, ENIVD (<http://www.enivd.de>). Only the pool of nymphs from
the patient's garden was strongly positive (RT-PCR cycle threshold
value of 22).

Discussion
These are the 1st 2 cases of TBE in Denmark outside Bornholm Island
that are confirmed by identification of viruses of the TBEV complex
in _I. ricinus_ nymphs collected at the same location and same time
of transmission to a patient. Both cases had a typical biphasic
disease starting with influenza-like symptoms, easily misdiagnosed
during the present influenza A(H1N1)v pandemic, and with some
neurological sequelae (dizziness, fatigue) after the
meningoencephalitis. Both patients were TBE IgM- and IgG-positive in
the acute serum. For the patient from 2008, we had the opportunity to
obtain convalescent serum approximately one year later, which, as
expected, was TBE IgG-positive and IgM-negative, and positive in the
neutralisation test confirming the qualitative ELISA test. It takes
time for neutralising antibodies to develop, and they are normally
not present during the acute illness [5].

It was expected that the distribution of TBE would expand in Europe
[1,2,8], and spread in Denmark has been suggested based on serology
in roe deer [4]. However, the investigation of roe deer serum
antibodies has in itself limited relevance to human medicine, partly
because of the uncertainty of the serology method used. So far, the
distribution on Zealand and the rest of Denmark is not known and
could be either very local or very wide. The finding of 2 confirmed
human cases in 2008 and 2009, respectively, suggests that TBEV has
been present but unnoticed for a longer time.

According to the Danish legislation, TBE is not a notifiable disease.
However, diagnostic tests for TBEV are only performed at the
Department of Virology at Statens Serum Institut, and we have not
seen any cases of TBE in Denmark outside Bornholm before these cases.
We have begun a systematic collection of ticks in Denmark and have so
far identified TBEV only in one of 2 likely locations in north
Zealand. The PCR is specific for the TBEV complex, but in addition,
we are in the process of culturing or otherwise amplifying the
viruses isolated from the collected ticks in collaboration with ENIVD
in order to obtain sequences for confirmation and molecular
epidemiology. Further sampling, molecular characterisation of the
Zealand TBEV, increased clinical awareness and continued monitoring
should confirm and clarify the spread of TBE in Denmark.

TBE is caused by 3 different subtypes of tick borne encephalitis
virus: Western European TBE virus, Far Eastern TBE virus and Siberian
TBE virus. Western European TBE (also known as Central European
encephalitis) is endemic in western and central European countries
and is expanding its range, as clearly described in the preceding
report. It is particularly common in forest and mountainous regions
of Austria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,
Germany, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, western Russia, Ukraine,
Belarus, Croatia and Slovenia. It occurs at a lower frequency in
Denmark, France, Liechtenstein, Italy, Norway, the Aland archipelago
and neighbouring Finnish coastline, and along the coastline of
southern Sweden, from Uppsala to Karlshamn. Thousands of cases of TBE
occur each year from late spring to early autumn; the total number of
annual cases in Western European countries has averaged 3000 over the
last 5 years [2000-2005]. This type of TBE is transmitted by the tick
_I. ricinus_, and outbreaks often follow periods when voles (the
principle reservoir) and ticks are numerous (between May and June and
between September and October).

As of mid 2006, no cases of TBE have ever been reported yet in the
British Isles (although it is possible that there may have been cases
imported into England, Wales or Northern Ireland which have not been
diagnosed or reported.

Vaccination against TBE is considered to be the most effective means
of preventing TBE for those living in endemic countries. The vaccine
has been used in national vaccination campaigns in Austria since 1982
and has continued on an annual basis since. There is also widespread
use of TBE vaccine in many other central European countries. Vaccine
should be considered for travellers to endemic areas. For more
