A horse in Lowndes county has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE], according to health officials. EEE is a rare disease caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It can cause inflammation of the brain, but on average, only 8 cases of EEE in humans are reported each year, CDC said.

"The more time someone is outdoors, the more time the person is at risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito; that is why we encourage everyone to take all precautions against mosquito bites," said Dr William Grow, South Health District director.

Severe cases of EEE infection in humans begin with the sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting, according to CDC; the illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma. About a third of patients who develop EEE die, and many of those who survive have mild to severe brain damage, said CDC. There is no specific treatment for EEE. Most cases have been found in Atlantic and Gulf Coast states.

In July [2017], a horse with EEE was found in Brooks county. For more information, call the local health department or visit http://www.cdc.gov/.

The Jackson County Health Department reports a horse has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), which is caused by the EEE virus. The EEE virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin since 2011. EEE virus is transmitted to humans, horses, birds, and other animals during bites from infected mosquitoes.

Mosquitoes acquire EEE virus by feeding on infected birds. The virus is not transmitted person to person or directly between animals or between animals and humans. Presence of a EEE positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the area infected with the EEE virus that can transmit the virus to people and other animals.

Clinical signs of EEE infection in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, blindness, paralysis, and death. Horse owners can vaccinate their horses against EEE virus to protect them from becoming ill.

Because EEE virus is known to be currently circulating, Wisconsin residents and visitors to the state should be vigilant in taking measures to prevent mosquito bites. It is important that people contact their healthcare provider if they suspect they have EEE illness. The best way to avoid mosquitoborne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate mosquito breeding sites. When cold weather arrives, the mosquitoes will be eliminated, but until then people are urged to take measures to protect themselves.

The Chippewa County Health Department reports that a horse in Chippewa County has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE). The EEE virus is transmitted by mosquitoes. The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection reported the positive test result to the Wisconsin Division of Public Health. No EEE cases in humans have been reported in Wisconsin this year or any year since 2011. The human EEE case in 2011 was only the 2nd case known to have occurred in Wisconsin since 1984.

The 3 articles above include the following measures to prevent mosquito bites:
- apply insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535, or PMD to clothing as well as exposed skin since mosquitoes may bite through clothing. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label;
- wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and socks when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk to reduce the amount of exposed skin, as weather permits;
- avoid being outdoors from dusk to dawn, peak mosquito biting times, if possible;
- set up outdoor fans to keep mosquitoes from flying near you;
- make sure window and door screens are in good repair to prevent mosquito entry;
- any containers that can collect water, such as tin cans, plastic containers, ceramic pots, or discarded tires, should be discarded or dumped daily; turn over wheelbarrows, wading pools, boats, and canoes when not in use;
- clean roof gutters and downspouts for proper drainage;
- change the water in birdbaths and pet dishes at least every 3 days;
- clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers;
- trim tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours;
- landscape to prevent water from pooling in low-lying areas.

Judging from the number of cases on this posting alone, it is clearly arbovirus season. Prevent breeding places for mosquitoes, use fly and mosquito repellent especially for horses and above all, vaccinate! Vaccination is usually a combination of EEE, western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus, and tetanus. A lot of protection for a couple of injections. - Mod.TG]
