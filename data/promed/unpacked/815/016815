Real Cause of Bird Flu: Industrial Agriculture
-----------------------------------------------
Industry caused the flu; why blame wild birds?
Not just in India, industrial poultry is the cause of the spread of the
bird flu outbreak worldwide. Several studies show that the transnational
poultry industry is the root cause of the problem. The spread of industrial
poultry production and trade networks have created ideal conditions for the
emergence and transmission of lethal viruses like the H5N1 strains of bird
flu. Inside factory farms, viruses becomes lethal and multiply. Air thick
with viral load from infected factory farms is carried for kilometers,
while integrated trade networks spread the disease through many carriers,
like live birds and chicken manure.
Comparatively, backyard poultry are not fueling the current wave of bird
flu outbreaks stalking large parts of the world. The epicenter of the
outbreaks are the factory farms of China and South East Asia. While wild
migratory birds can carry the virus, at least for short distances, the
viruses are spread by unhygienic farms, global studies said. In the case of
the recent outbreak of bird flu in India, the epicenter of the outbreak was
in 18 factory farms in and around Navapur in Maharashtra, where there is no
sanctuary for migratory birds in the vicinity.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization in November 2005 said, "To date,
extensive testing of clinically normal migratory birds in the infected
countries has not produced any positive results for H5N1 so far." Even with
the current cases of H5N1 in wild birds in Europe, experts agree these
birds probably contacted the virus in the Black Sea region, where H5N1 is
well established in poultry, and died while heading westward to escape the
unusually cold conditions.
The attributed reasons for the spread of H5N1 virus by migratory birds
among geese in Qinghai Lake in north China were negated by BirdLife
International, which pointed out that the lake has many surrounding poultry
farms. It also has integrated fish farms where chicken feces are commonly
used as feed and manure. Besides, rail routes connect the region to areas
of bird flu outbreaks, like Lanzhou.
Wild migratory birds and backyard poultry are the victims and not carriers
of the disease. The geographical spread of the disease does not match with
migratory routes and seasons, the BirdLife International report said.
A study done by a global organization, GRAIN shows that migratory birds and
backyard poultry are not effective vectors of bird flu. For example, in
Malaysia, the mortality rate from H5N1 among village chicken is only 5
percent, indicating that the virus has a hard time spreading among small
scale chicken flocks. H5N1 outbreaks in Laos, which is surrounded by
infected countries, have only occurred in the nation's few factory farms,
which were supplied by Thai hatcheries.
The only case of bird flu in backyard poultry, which account for over 90
percent of Laos's production, occurred next to infected factory farms.
The lethal bird flu outbreaks took place in large factory farms in
Netherlands in 2003, Japan in 2004 and Egypt in 2006. The Nigerian outbreak
earlier this year [2006] occurred in a single factory farm distant from hot
spots of migratory birds, but known for importing unregulated hatchable eggs.
In September 2004, Cambodian authorities noted that the source of a bird
flu outbreak was chicks supplied by the Thai company, Charoen Pokphand.
This company dominates the feed industry and is the biggest supplier of
chicks to China, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Turkey, which have witnessed bird
flu outbreaks. Ukraine, where bird flu occurred, imported 12 million live
birds in 2004.
Russian authorities pointed out that feed is one of the main suspected
sources of an H5N1 outbreak at a large factory farm in Kurgan province.
A newsletter of e-Pharmail said the outbreak of avian flu in Maharashtra
may be due to inoculating improperly cultured vaccine (inactivated viruses)
in poultry, allegedly distributed by Venkateshwara Hatcheries.

[For a profile of Charoen Pokphand (India) that claims that their flocks
are healthy, go to:

and
<http://icmr.icfai.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20Strategy2/Charoen%20Pokphand.htm>.
Vertical integration was highly developed at Charoen Pokphand; reportedly,
nothing went to waste at the group companies. For instance, the
protein-rich chicken feathers were recycled to make chicken feed; the
innards of the chickens were recycled into fish feed; and the carcasses of
chickens were fed to crocodiles on the group's crocodile farms:
