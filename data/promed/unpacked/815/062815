RIBAVIRIN, AVAILABILITY (06)
============================
Date: Sun, 27 April 1997
From: Charles Calisher <ccalisher@vines.colostate.edu>
Within the past weeks ProMED-mail has posted messages concerning a serious
Lassa fever outbreak in Sierra Leone. Recent indications are that the
situation remains critical and, given social and other conditions there,
could become worse.
[see

Lassa fever - Sierra Leone (03) 970323132330]
A critically low supply of the only antiviral known to be effective against
Lassa virus infection prompted me to ask what I thought was the simple
question "Why?". I asked the readers of ProMED-mail, government authorities,
and the manufacturer itself to be so kind as to provide whatever information
they might have regarding this shortfall.

I received many responses. Some constituted no more than what the writer was
able to dredge up from standard books or by "asking around". I made numerous
inquiries and was able to obtain some remarkable comments from government and
nongovernment employees, some of which were for the record, some not.
I had very generous responses from some people here and abroad as well as
from a representative of the manufacturer of ribavirin but I was unable to
obtain permission to quote his message, so I will not do so. I cannot, of
course, quote those who spoke off the record, although I will here summarize
my views as to the situation. I do not speak for ProMED-mail on this issue
and I have not cleared any of this with other Moderators of ProMED-mail
because I do not wish them to get sucked into coresponsibility for any errors
I may make or misguided views I might have. I apologize in advance for any
misstatements I might make or misconceptions I might have.
1. There really is a woeful lack of available ribavirin. There seems to
be a sufficient amount of ribavirin produced but it is not available. I
define availability not as how much exists but as how much one can get when
one needs it.
2. A manufacturing problem caused a shut-down in both production and
shipment of this drug. This is, of course, reasonable, proper, and
appropriate, but there had been no sufficient back-up and the newly scheduled
production/release date may still be months away. The manufacturer has
reconfigured the concentration of ribavirin in the IV preparation (8%) such
that the concentration will be lower (than the 10% concentration heretofore
used) but the quality control problem might not recur. How this will effect
cost is another issue, which I cannot begin to estimate.
3. No one has begun to answer the question as to the reason for the high
cost of ribavirin. As the drug is a simple nucleoside analog, it might not
be expensive to produce. Perhaps when the patent expires the U.S. Government
will contract out the production and distribution of ribavirin, solving some
important problems and initiating less important ones.
4. Ribavirin is already approved for inhalation therapy for treatment of
severely ill infants with lower respiratory tract respiratory syncytial virus
infections. Oral ribavirin is being used in studies (combined with
interferon) of treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. I have
received conflicting views as to whether applications for approval are or are
not planned for filing in the U.S. and Europe at the end of this year.
Intravenous ribavirin is not under consideration for licensing but it is
available on a compassionate basis, provided the physician first obtains an
Investigational New Drug approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
I find it fascinating that a drug can be licensed for use but that the route
of administration of that drug is not wholly restricted. That is, a drug
licensed for use by one route can be used by another route (which might make
it ineffective) and there is not much the Food and Drug Administration can do
about it. Nonetheless, if the drug is not available, questions about the
route of administration are only hypothetical.
5. The U.S. Government laboratories that would need ribavirin the most
(for laboratory accidents, limited distribution overseas, etc.) have very
little on hand, perhaps sufficient to treat no more than tens of people,
should there be a laboratory or field exposure. Let me say again that the
entirety of the U.S. Government has on hand enough ribavirin to treat perhaps
100 people. Dennis Rodman has more tattoos than that.
Other countries, including Canada and European countries, are in the same
boat.
6. These government laboratories have been offered ribavirin at
extraordinary cost with the understanding that some multiple of those
purchases would be donated to countries overseas with needs. I was never
very good at arithmetic but if one divides the $1,000 cost of a course
of treatment by four (one purchased course + three donated courses), the
actual cost is $250, or about $50 per dose. I must be missing something here.
7. One north European reader told me that powdered ribavirin is
available in Sweden and Norway for US$1,500 for 3x6g and that 200 mg tablets
are available at a cost of US$1,000/180 tablets (retail US$1,300). I may be
wrong but it appears to me as though all the distributors of ribavirin in
Europe (Sweden, Norway, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, UK, and elsewhere are
merely licensed by the U.S. manufacturer.
An employee of the U.S. Department of State suggested that in addition to the
humanitarian function of having ribavirin available where needed, the U.S.
should keep in mind its own self-interests. A Department of State internet
link covers basic information on emerging diseases as well as a position
statement regarding the Department's awareness that infectious diseases are a
problem [see <http://www.usia.gov/usis.html> and click on "What's New". I
went to this site to confirm the accuracy of the address but you could also
go to <http://www.usia.gov/tropical/global/disease/infected.htm>.
It would certainly be visionary for the U.S. to be in a position to
distribute an antiviral that is effective against an array of viruses known
to be human pathogens. Not visionary in terms of ethics, not visionary in
terms of troop morale, not visionary in terms of good will and international
responsibilities, and not visionary in terms of experimental medical
research. It may be time for an investigation, not of the manufacturer,
which seems to be doing what it must and which cannot serve as a foreign aid
arm of the Government, but of the Government's role in not acquiring and
stockpiling a useful antiviral drug. Very recently, the manufacturer was
able to release a small batch of ribavirin for shipment overseas (ostensibly
to Sierra Leone); that certainly helps and is appreciated, but it is not
enough. What would it be like if we waited for an outbreak of streptococcal
diseases to produce penicillin? What parent would tolerate such a situation?
And while I am at it, what parent would not pay whatever it cost to get that
penicillin, no matter how unreasonable that cost. What we have here is a
modified Harry Lime philosophy.
Meanwhile, the situation in Sierra Leone, and particularly at the Kenema
Special Lassa ward grows more critical, in spite of the heroic work of the
MERLIN teams; 239 cases with 35 deaths in <4 months of 1997, compared with
367 cases with 93 deaths in all of 1996. Isolation and treatment of
patients, restructuring a crumbling medical infrastructure, education, rodent
control (a little rain might provide enough incentive for rodents to stay
where they are instead of invading homes), cessation of hostilities, and a
return to civility will mean the end of this outbreak but liberal accession
to ribavirin would bring this time closer, save more lives, and avoid more
misery.
Paraphrasing what one of our readers said in a message to me, "I can imagine
what might have happened had ProMED-mail been some poor fool writing to worry
about aircraft and battleship dispersal in Hawaii on 6 December 1941."
