An outbreak of deadly African horse sickness [AHS] has taken place in South Africa. In all, 34 cases of the disease have been confirmed or suspected across South Africa.

Due to the disease, at least 20 horses have perished in KwaZulu-Natal. Some other cases have been reported in Gauteng. Western Cape is said to be the only province which is free from the disease.

Therefore, measures are being taken to maintain the same status. Moving in and out of Western Cape has been banned for horses. On Friday [28 Feb 2014], the province's agriculture agency levied the restrictions.

AHS affects horses, mules, zebras, and donkeys. Fever, heart, and respiratory problems are some of complications that take place due to the disease. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease.

Western Cape agriculture MEC [Member of the Executive Council] Gerrit van Rensburg's office said to protect local horses, idea of direct horse movements to the province's AHS control area was discouraged.

"Due to persistent high rainfall in the rest of the country, the number of cases has increased dramatically and (they) are also occurring earlier than in previous years", said Van Rensburg's office in a statement.

Experts explained the summer rainfall provinces make favorable environment for the spread of disease. Moreover, the Western Cape export zone around Kenilworth and Cape Town has a buffer zone. In this zone, different measures like quarantine, surveillance, and vaccination measures are taken to keep the disease at bay.

Safety measures need to be taken as if the disease spreads to the area around Kenilworth, then it could prove disastrous for South Africa's horse export status. Traffic police and department of agriculture officials have been keeping a watch on the movement of horses in the province.

[African horse sickness (AHS) is endemic in South Africa with the exception of the AHS controlled areas of the Western Cape Province. These areas were declared as part of the AHS free zone application to the OIE in 2012. According to an immediate notification submitted by South Africa on 10 Jul 2013, 2 AHS outbreaks, involving 4 cases (out of a population of 18 susceptible Thoroughbred horses) had been detected in the AHS protection zone on 20 and 28 May 2013. The agent was identified by PCR in a blood sample from a horse that died without showing signs of typical AHS and without any history of a recent AHS vaccination. The agent could not be isolated and no sequencing of the virus could, reportedly, be carried out. The outbreak did not spread in a susceptible horse population as would be expected, and was declared resolved as of 3 Jul 2013 (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13708).
