Health officials say 6 people are receiving rabies treatments after being exposed to a rabid horse in Whitfield County in northwest Georgia. North Georgia Health District spokeswoman Jennifer King told The Daily Citizen of Dalton that the people had contact with the horse's saliva or mucus.

King said the horse, which was pastured near Dalton's municipal airport, began to show symptoms on 9 Jun 2012. Health officials don't know how the horse became infected, but it was likely bitten by a rabid wild animal. Other horses and cattle in the pasture have been given rabies vaccinations and will be closely monitored for the next 6 months.

Officials said that among wild animals, more than 80 percent of all positive laboratory cases in Georgia and the U.S. are from raccoons. This is the 2nd case of rabies confirmed in Whitfield County this year [2012]. The 1st was a raccoon in Dalton in April 2012 (http://daltondailycitizen.com/local/x1047715131/Rabid-horse-confirmed-near-Dalton).

[It is not clear from the above report how long the 6 people had been exposed to the sick animal prior to diagnosis of rabies virus infection and when post-exposure prophylaxis was initiated. No tests are available to diagnose rabies infection in humans before the onset of clinical disease. The incubation period for rabies in both humans and animals is typically 1-3 months but may vary from less than a week to over a year. Further information is awaited.
