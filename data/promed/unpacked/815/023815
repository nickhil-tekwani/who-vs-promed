CLIMATE CHANGE (9)
==================
"Organizations to Cooperate on Climate and Disease Research," Environmental
Change Report, vol VII, 22 December 1995.
The US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) plans to coordinate
international research efforts on the relationship between climate change
and human diseases. William Sprigg, director of the NAS Board on
Atmospheric Sciences and Climate, told GECR that the board is working
on forming an interdisciplinary team to develop a research strategy and ways
of articulating what is known about the connections between climatic events
and the spread of vector-borne diseases.
Sprigg is working with the US EPA and Centers for Disease
Control, as well as other US government agencies, to make the team
a reality, although right now "everyone is waiting for a budget."
The World Health Organization and the World Meteorological
Organization have also expressed interest in participating in the
effort, Sprigg said. If all goes well, Sprigg expects that the
team will develop a research program will over the next three
years. The team will identify basic research needs, as well as
identifying climate prediction tools that could be applied
immediately. A system of monitoring the connections between
climatic events and disease outbreaks would also be established. In
an era of shrinking research finds, the team will also attempt to
prioritize which research would have the most significant health
benefits.
For example, climatic conditions linked to El Nino events have
been correlated to outbreaks of cholera, dengue fever, and malaria
in various parts of the world and may also be connected to the
recent hantavirus outbreak in the American Southwest, according
to research presented at the American Geophysical Union's fall
meeting, held 11 - 15 December in San Francisco, California. Providing
healthcare workers with more information about the connections
between climate and disease, as well as advance predictions of
key climatic events such as El Nino, could help alleviate the impacts
of these disease outbreaks.

[The following comments are intended to amplify a few points
mentioned in the article above:]
From: "William Sprigg" <wsprigg@nas.edu>
We need to emphasize that "a proposal to develop an international
research and information dissemination strategy on this subject has been
submitted to the EPA for coordination and funding among several U.S.
agencies." Also, we might highlight one of the benefits will be
long-lead alerts of potential health problems. Such would allow more
rapid, mobilized, targeted-for-effect, actions (eg. mosquito control and
increased surveillance). Another point to clarify in future might be
that the proposal is from the National Research Council representing both
the National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine.
