A series of whole-herd tests have found several more cattle infected with bovine tuberculosis in a Dane county herd. The animal health incident began in late September [2018] when a cow at slaughter had lesions in its lungs consistent with TB.

Confirmatory tests were then done in Ames, Iowa at the National Veterinary Services Lab, run by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).

Because there was what acting State Veterinarian Darlene Konkle called a "strong trace" to Maier Farms LLC in rural Waunakee, several levels of TB testing were done on all of the farm's cows and young stock -- all animals over 2 months of age.

Konkle gave a report on the unusual incident to the citizen policy board overseeing the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection at a 15 Nov 2018 meeting in Madison.

The incident is unusual since Wisconsin has had TB-free status since 1980 and staff at her branch of the agency have no experience dealing with this kind of incident -- although they have regular drills to rehearse what to do in cases like this.

Konkle explained this incident is not going to jeopardize the state's TB-free status because the case is isolated and there is no evidence the disease has spread.

In conjunction with the state's public health authorities, all personnel and service providers at the farm, including breeders, veterinarians, workers, owners and their families were given TB tests.

Testing
-------
The genetic testing of the organism isolated from the 1st cow, which was diagnosed with the disease at slaughter, showed it matched the DNA of a tuberculosis organism isolated from a worker who had been diagnosed with the disease when he was employed at the farm briefly in 2015.

Testing of the cattle on the farm includes 3 tests, Konkle said, including a caudal fold skin test, which is the initial screening test. Any animals that are found to be "reactors" in this test are removed from the herd and either necropsied or slaughtered. "All animals reacting to the skin test go to slaughter," she said.

There were 3 animals that were reactors that went to slaughter on 29 Oct 2018 and 2 of them were confirmed to have TB by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The genomic testing from those animals' TB organism wasn't yet available at the time Konkle spoke to the board.

Another group of animals was being removed from the farm on 15 Nov 2018, as Konkle was giving her report to the board. Genomic testing will be done on all TB organisms isolated from any infected cattle, she said.

Follow-up testing includes comparative cervical tests and blood tests.

Challenges ahead
----------------
Speaking with reporters, Konkle said a total of 48 reactor animals have been removed -- 10 initially and the remainder of the 48 left the farm on 15 Nov 2018. During the necropsy process, tissues and lymph nodes are taken to test for the TB organism.

When samples come into the USDA's lab, the organism is cultured. But since the bacterium that causes the disease is so slow-growing, it can take several weeks to get results, she explained.

Working with APHIS officials, state animal health authorities are now looking at any herds possibly having had contact with Maier Farms in the 5 last years.

"Our initial challenges were this is a large undertaking. We have been working with the Division of Public Health and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources on the potential for wildlife involvement," she said.

Another challenge is the disease is slow to develop and grow in animals or in humans. The farm is currently under quarantine, which means they cannot move bull calves off the farm nor can they send any cull cows to slaughter. Milk is still being sold from the farm, with the knowledge that pasteurization kills the pathogen that could be carried in the milk. Even if some TB organism were in the milk, the heating of pasteurization is known to kill it.

Though it hasn't happened in Wisconsin, in anyone's recent memory, Konkle said in any given year there are 2 to 8 herds affected by the disease across the United States.

What's next?
------------
Next steps for Maier Farms "will depend on how many infected cattle we find in the coming weeks," Konkle said.

One option for the family is depopulation of the whole herd -- about 1000 milking cows and 1000 head of young stock housed at several locations. Another option would be a test-and-removal protocol, she said, which would require periodic testing.

Farmers, said Konkle, should always be thinking about biosecurity and "what can be done to do it better" in the wake of this infection.

This unusual case may be tied to a human case of TB. Readers are encouraged to see more information on this particular link on ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis - USA (06): (WI) bovine 20181107.6132360 and on ProMED-mail post Bovine tuberculosis - USA (05): (WI) bovine 20181031.6122495. This is a very difficult situation for the producer. We hope this is brought to a speedy conclusion. - Mod.TG
