[San Diego] County public health officials warned campers Tuesday [17 Sep 2013] to stay away from common California ground squirrels after 3 of the rodents trapped at a Palomar Mountain campground tested positive for plague.

Chris Conlan, supervising vector ecologist for the San Diego County Vector Control Program, said the 3 plague squirrels were trapped at the Cedar Grove Campground inside Palomar Mountain State Park.

The county had already found 3 plague squirrels at Cedar Grove this year [2013] and one at nearby Doane Valley Campground in May, bringing the season total to 7. Though that number is higher than the 4 detected by county officials in 2012, it's less than the 9 squirrels that tested positive in 2008.

Conlan said the most common way to get plague is to be bitten by a flea that was living on an infected animal.

To avoid the disease, health officials caution against feeding, touching or camping near the burrows of wild animals. Touching sick or dead animals is also a risk, and household pets should be protected with flea control medication and kept out of areas where plague has been detected.

Though the county detects a few plague-infected squirrels nearly every year, no human plague cases have been reported in San Diego County since 1926, though there have been cases elsewhere in the state.

In 2006, for example, a 28-year-old Los Angeles woman tested positive for plague after handling raw rabbit meat hunted in an area where plague fleas were present. She survived after treatment with 2 types of antibiotics.

A study published by the California Department of Public Health states that there have been 62 human plague cases reported in California from 1926 to 2013. Of those, 39 survived and 23 died.

Symptoms of plague infection include the sudden onset of fever and chills and tender, swollen lymph nodes. Those who experience these symptoms one week after visiting an area where plague was recently found should immediately contact their doctor.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.
