A man in Zhaoqing, neglecting precautions, developed fever, chills and weakness in both legs after being bitten by a mite, even being diagnosed with stroke before being confirmed to have scrub typhus in Guangzhou. Physicians advise that summertime is the peak season for mite bites, and residents should promptly seek medical attention if they have persistent high fever of unknown causes and discover any obvious bite marks on their body.

In mid-July [2020], the retired, previously healthy, 67-year-old man was prescribed some medicine at a nearby clinic for chills. However, after taking the medicine for 3 or 4 days, not only did his symptoms of chills and fever not improve, but he also discovered when he woke on the morning of 17 Jul [2020] that both legs were too weak to walk normally, and was accompanied by family to the hospital after realizing that his condition was getting serious.

In the local hospital, a brain CT examination revealed that he had lacunar cerebral infarction in the right frontal lobe and right basal ganglia, as well as hypokalemia [low blood potassium level]. After potassium supplementation and other treatments, the weakness in his legs improved. However, chills and fever returned, with hypokalemia and hyponatremia [low blood sodium level]. "Considering that my dad had a history of cerebral infarction 3 or 4 years ago, he still thought of the big hospital in Guangzhou for treatment," the patient's son said. On 18 Jul [2020], [the patient] went to Guangdong Sanjiu Brain Hospital.

Hu Yunxin, the director of the Sixth Department of Neurology in the hospital, carefully checked the patient's imaging data and found that his intracranial lesions were obviously old and were not the main cause of the disease. After detailed questioning and physical examination, the director found a black scab on the inside of the patient's right calf. "Patients always think that this wound is a burn caused by the exhaust pipe of a motorcycle. In fact, this is obviously a trace of 'eschar' after being bitten by a chigger," Hu Yunxin said. After a clear diagnosis, the patient was given an antibiotic and symptomatic treatment. The patient's symptoms improved significantly, and he was discharged from the hospital recently.

Hu Yunxin reminded that each year from May to November is the most common season for tsutsugamushi disease [scrub typhus], and the peak incidence is from June to July. In the south, especially Guangdong, Hainan, Guangxi and other places, tsutsugamushi is more common. "After being bitten by a chigger, there may be persistent fever, weakness of the limbs, and even liver, kidney, lung, and brain involvement. Similar to other infectious diseases, it is easy to be misdiagnosed." Hu Yunxin said that most patients who are diagnosed and treated in time can recover, but if there is no targeted treatment, the consequences may be more serious.

Because the area of the chigger bite is generally hidden and does not elicit symptoms, such as pain and itching, many people are unaware of having been bitten. Hu Yunxin reminded the general public that if you have been to grassland, bushes and other places, and find that you have repeated fever, fatigue, headache and dizziness after returning, you should be alert to whether a chigger has bitten you.

[Scrub typhus is caused by a rickettsia-like microorganism _Orientia tsutsugamushi_ that is transmitted by chiggers, the larval stage of trombiculid mites. Chiggers feed on the skin cells of animals, including humans and rodents. After feeding on their hosts, chiggers drop to the ground and become nymphs, which then mature into adults that feed only on plant materials. The cutaneous reaction to chiggers leaves a characteristic black eschar that is useful for making the diagnosis. Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the infected chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _O. tsutsugamushi_ (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article).

Scrub typhus has been reported from regions that extend from Japan and eastern Russia southward to Australia and westward to Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Scrub typhus is typically a nonspecific febrile illness. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients range from 1% to 30% (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation.

The Weil-Felix test is an agglutination test based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. The Weil-Felix test continues to be used for the diagnosis of scrub typhus in resource-poor regions, but it has poor sensitivity and specificity (https://www.japi.org/r2f4c4b4/relevance-of-weil-felix-test-in-diagnosis-of-scrub-typhus-in-india). The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are not often available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic.

Because antibody titers may persist in some individuals for years after the original exposure, only demonstration of recent changes in titers between paired specimens can be considered reliable confirmation of an acute scrub typhus infection. The most rapid and specific diagnostic assays for scrub typhus rely on molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect DNA in a whole blood, eschar swab, or tissue sample. Immunostaining procedures can also be performed on formalin-fixed tissue samples (https://www.cdc.gov/typhus/healthcare-providers/index.html).

Zhaoqing, with a population of almost 4 million residents in 2010, is a city in Guangdong Province, China in the Pearl River Delta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhaoqing).
