A dozen inmates were sickened, including 3 in critical condition, in a
suspected botulism outbreak after they drank alcohol brewed inside a
prison cell, Utah health officials said Wed 5 Oct 2011. 8 male
prisoners who were hospitalized had exhibited botulism symptoms and
preliminary tests were positive for the disease in 2 of the men, said
Dr Dagmar Vitek, the medical director of the Salt Lake Valley Health
Department.

It was not clear where the drink was made, what its ingredients were,
or who was responsible for its production. Prison officials believe
the inmates drank the cell brew, often referred to as "pruno", over
the weekend [1-2 Oct 2011], corrections department spokesman Steve
Gehrke said.

Vitek said she understood the liquid is typically made with fruit,
water, and sugar. Bread and raw potato are other common ingredients,
she said.

"It's obviously considered contraband," said Gehrke, "But right now,
we're not really focused on the disciplinary aspect of this, we want
to focus on the health aspect and to take steps to prevent it from
happening again."

It's not uncommon for inmates to make their own alcohol, although it's
a violation of prison rules, Gehrke said. Health official are testing
samples of the "pruno" to pinpoint the specific bacteria that
triggered the disease, which has 7 different strains. Those results
are not expected for several days, Vitek said.

Most of the 12 inmates became sick on Sat 1 October 2011, she said.
The last illness was reported 2 days later, and officials believe they
have identified everyone who might be at risk, although the incubation
period for the disease can be as long as 8 days, Vitek said.

The 8 hospitalized inmates were treated with an antitoxin obtained
from the CDC. 3 of them remained in critical condition Wed 5 Oct 2011,
while 4 others were being treated at the prison infirmary, Vitek
said.

The disease is rare in Utah, which last reported 2 cases in 2003.
Before that, the last known case was in 1993, Vitek said. Data from
the CDC shows an average of 145 cases of botulism are annually
reported in the USA, of which 15 percent are foodborne and typically
caused by improper home canning.

[Pruno, or prison wine, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruno) is an
alcoholic liquid variously made from apples, oranges, fruit cocktail,
ketchup, sugar, and possibly other ingredients, including crumbled
bread. Bread provides the yeast for the pruno to ferment. Pruno
originated in (and remains largely confined to) prisons and jails,
where it can be produced cheaply, easily, and discreetly. The
concoction can be made using only a plastic bag, hot running water,
and a towel or sock to conceal the pulp during fermentation. The end
result has been colorfully described as a "vomit-flavored
wine-cooler", although flavor is often not the primary objective.
Depending on the time spent fermenting, the sugar content, and the
quality of the ingredients and preparation, pruno's alcohol content by
volume can range from as low as 2 percent (equivalent to a very weak
beer) to as high as 14 percent (equivalent to a strong wine).

The following is from Vugia DJ, Mase SR, Cole B, et al: Botulism from
drinking pruno. Emerg Infect Dis 2009; 15(1): 69-71 and describes 2
outbreaks of this in California prisons, one of which was covered by
ProMED-mail in 2004 (Botulism, prison brew - USA (CA) 20040806.2155):

"In our investigations, the potatoes used in the pruno could have been
the source of botulinum toxin. _Clostridium botulinum_ is commonly
found in the soil, and its spores have been found on raw potatoes.
Several outbreaks of botulism caused by eating potatoes have occurred
in the United States, and laboratory studies have shown that _C.
botulinum_ spores on the surface of raw potatoes can survive baking
and lead to production of botulinum toxin. The warm anaerobic
fermentation process of making pruno probably predisposes toward
production of botulinum toxin, particularly if any ingredient happens
to be contaminated with _C. botulinum_ or its spores, such as the
potatoes used in these 2 instances.

"Pruno is popular in prisons across the country, and it is somewhat
surprising that botulism caused by pruno consumption has not been
previously reported. This lack of reporting may be due to the fact
that potatoes are not generally used in the making of pruno; recipes
for making pruno and references to pruno found on the Internet do not
mention potatoes as an ingredient. Occasional crackdowns on making
pruno in some prisons could have driven some inmates to look for
alternative ingredients, including potatoes. Nonetheless, with more
than 2 million inmates in prisons and jails in the United States, this
illicit homemade alcoholic drink may put more inmates at risk for
botulism. Anecdotally, making pruno has been attempted outside
prisons, possibly extending the potential risk for foodborne botulism
carried by this novel vehicle beyond the prison walls. Risk for
botulism from consuming pruno should be conveyed to inmates, prison
staff, the medical community, and the general public. Any inmate with
clinical botulism should be examined for an infected wound caused by
drug injection and queried about recent drug use and drinking pruno."
