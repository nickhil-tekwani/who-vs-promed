Source: ADNS, 2005, 01 Jan-09 Sep, table 11 [edited]

According to table 11 at the above URL ("ANIMAL DISEASE SITUATION PER
COUNTRY AND PER DISEASE"), 41 outbreaks of bluetongue have been reported by
Spain to the Animal Disease Notification System (ADNS) of the European
Union from 1 Jan 2005 through 5 Sep 2005. In the previous issue of the said
table, covering the period 1 Jan 2005-1 Sep 2005, the total number of
outbreaks was indicated to be 38. In the last issue table 11 before the
reemergence of bluetongue in Spain, namely the one covering the period 1
Jan 2005 - 21 Jul 2005, 7 outbreaks were recorded (actually, they had
occurred in Jan 2005).
These data indicate that since the start of the current bluetongue season
(which reportedly took place in Andalusia towards the end of Jul 2005), 34
outbreaks have been recorded -- including 3 between 1 and 5 Sep 2005. No
updated data are available on their locations, the number of animals
involved, or the latter's respective species, age and immunity status. It
may be assumed that the bluetongue virus currently involved is the same one
as was responsible for the 2004 season, namely BT4, but confirmation (or
otherwise) will help.
Spain has not issued an OIE follow-up report on Bluetongue since 29 Jul
2005 (OIE Disease Information 2005; 18(30), 29 Jul)
