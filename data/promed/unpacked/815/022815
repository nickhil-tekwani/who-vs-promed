MARBURG VIRUS, PERSISTENCE

According to an article published in 1996 in Voprosi Virusologii (41:32-4),
[Survival of Marburg virus infectivity on contaminated surfaces and in
aerosols] by Belanov EF, Muntianov VP, Kriuk VD, Sokolov AV, Bormotov NI,
P'iankov OV, Sergeev AN, Marburg virus was shown to survive for up to 4-5
days on contaminated surfaces. In aerosol, it is not stable, the specific
rate of its inactivation being 0.05 min-1.
Relatively close contact is needed for virus transmission from human to
human, although the possibility of aerosol transmission of the infection
may be appreciably increased in cases with high titer viremias. This
suggests that the recent illnesses in soldiers could have been due to less
than intimate contact with gold miners or the mines themselves. Having
visited many of the "hotels" in that area of North Kivu, Democratic Congo,
I can say that as of 1991, they were infested with rodents (Rattus sp.).
Many of these exist in ramshackle mining towns where soldiers may have been
posted. Since the material can last this long on surfaces, I think this
suggests that better sanitary conditions for all intra-African commercial
traffic, especially trucks with live animals, blood supply vehicles and of
course airplanes, should be instituted immediately to prevent further
spread in the Pays de Grands Lacs (Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania,
Zambia, and the DRC) as well as to nations participating in the Congolese
civil war. It also suggests that populations in internal displacement and
international migration could be at higher risk if more cases are found in
camps in the rebel held Eastern region of the DRC.

[No rodent host has been shown for either Marburg or Ebola viruses. Better
sanitation is always a good idea but how to bring this about? Anyway, the
soldiers have not been shown to have had Marburg virus infection. We await
further laboratory reports. - Mod.CC]
