GeoSentinel, the global surveillance program of the International
Society of Travel Medicine (ISTM) wishes to report a new
travel-related case of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria acquired in
Great Exuma.

Prof. Dr. Gerd Burchard at our Hamburg, Germany site (HAM) located at
the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Diseases reported that the
patient had returned to Germany on 15 Mar 2008 after a 2-week stay.
This 58-year-old German-born lifelong resident of Germany had become
ill about one week ago. She was admitted to the neurology service at
another hospital with fever, headache and suspected temporal
arteritis, and, fortunately, a malaria thick film was ordered, even
though the Bahamas is considered non-endemic for malaria. On detailed
enquiry, she did not have any exposures in countries considered
malarious.

The Bahamas are considered to be an area where malaria transmission
does not normally occur and for which antimalarial drugs are not
usually recommended. From August 2007 to 13 Dec 2007, the US CDC
recommended malaria preventive medication (prophylaxis) for travel to
Great Exuma after a small outbreak during August 2007. An outbreak of
malaria had previously occurred on Great Exuma in the late spring and
summer of 2006. This travel related case indicates a possible 3rd
outbreak.

GeoSentinel sites and network members have intensified surveillance
for further suspect cases, and we would appreciate hearing from
others if they encounter such cases.

[The outbreak in 2006 and the additional 2 cases in 2007 were
investigated by the CDC, and the most likely source was found to be
gametocyte carriers from Haiti. So far, malaria is not transmitted in
the Bahamas, but infections transmitted by immigrants carrying
gametocytes are difficult to prevent. Malaria prophylaxis is, at
present, not indicated in travelers to the Bahamas. - Mod.EP]
