Rice farmers in West Coast Demerara in Region 3 [Essequibo Islands-West Demerara] have encountered a very strange development in some plots. It is a disease which looks like "root worms or root rot" but it has significant immunity against all known insecticides and this is what sends fear into all rice farmers. Nothing seems to stop the progression of this disease.

Rice emerges with a pale yellow colour, then it changes rapidly after application of fertilizer at 18-21 days old [to] a rich olive-green. However, plots never did that change. They remained pale yellow well past 45 days old and 90 per cent of the plants had not attained more than six inches height.

Scientists at Burma Rice Research Station have got to be more decisive. Sweeps with a net [were] able to identify [a] tiny brown [insect] that would bore [into] the young rice plants.

[A range of pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes, have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Some of these pathogens may lead to yellowing and stunting as described above, but some physiological disorders may also lead to similar symptoms.

The discovery of insects in the affected plots does not prove a causal relationship and the lack of effect from insecticides would suggest that this is not primarily a pest problem. However, insects (for example, brown rice hoppers) are also known as vectors for several rice viruses (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives), some of which may lead to chlorosis and stunting of plants. Symptoms will not appear until some time after the infection has taken place, and therefore insecticide treatment when symptoms are noticed will seem ineffective because they cannot "cure" the plants, although it may reduce the further spread of a virus.

Reliable molecular diagnosis of the cause and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems above is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
