Sarasota-based ice cream maker Big Olaf Creamery agreed to recall its ice cream from store shelves after public health officials linked the company to a listeria outbreak, Fox 13 first reported Friday [8 Jul 2022].

Florida Department of Health Jeremy Redfern confirmed the recall Saturday [9 Jul 2022], adding that the company has halted production of ice cream products until health officials complete their investigation.

In a food safety alert posted Friday [8 Jul 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advised Florida residents and businesses to immediately throw away any ice cream produced by Big Olaf Creamery or any of its associated brands.

The Tampa Bay Times was not able to reach Big Olaf Creamery for comment Saturday [9 Jul 2022]. The company's products are sold under various brand names and may still be on store shelves, according to the CDC. People in Florida should check with store employees before buying or eating ice cream if they are uncertain where it comes from. Tampa Bay area stores that may have sold Big Olaf Creamery products are listed on the company's website.

Investigation details
-----------------------
The Florida Department of Health, CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several other states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are collecting different types of data to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to ice cream.

Epidemiologic data
----------------------
No new illnesses have been reported since the initial announcement on 30 Jun 2022. As of 8 Jul 2022, a total of 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 10 states (see map). Twelve sick people are residents of Florida, and 9 reported traveling to Florida before getting sick. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 24 Jan 2021 through 12 Jun 2022 (see timeline [at source URL]).

Sick people range in age from less than 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 72, and 52% are male. Twenty-two people (96%) have been hospitalized. One death in a person who was not pregnant has been reported from Illinois. Five [women] got sick during their pregnancy, and one [woman's] illness resulted in a fetal loss.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 3 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Public health officials continue to interview people about the foods they ate before they got sick. Of the 18 people interviewed, all (100%) reported eating ice cream. Among 18 people who remembered details about the type of ice cream they ate, 10 reported eating Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream or eating ice cream at locations that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery.

Seven ill people were identified as part of 3 illness clusters in this outbreak. An illness cluster is defined as 2 or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating food from the same retail location before becoming ill. If several unrelated ill people ate food from the same retail location, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. All 3 illness clusters were at retail locations that sell Big Olaf Creamery ice cream.

This investigation is ongoing to determine if any additional products are linked to illnesses.

Public health actions
-------------------
CDC is concerned that Big Olaf Creamery ice cream could still be in people's homes or available for sale in stores in Florida. CDC recommends people not eat, and restaurants and retailers not serve or sell, Big Olaf Creamery ice cream. Consumers should throw away any remaining products they have at home.

[As of 8 Jul 2022, the total case count remains at 23 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in 10 US states. Although no new illnesses have been reported since 30 Jun 2022, more of the infected people in this outbreak now remember eating ice cream, and in those who remember details about the type of ice cream they ate, more people remember eating Big Olaf Creamery brand ice cream or eating ice cream at locations that might have been supplied by Big Olaf Creamery. On [Fri 8 Jul 2022], Big Olaf Creamery has now issued a recall of its products.

At this point, we are awaiting results of culturing Big Olaf ice cream and Big Olaf Creamery premises. If Big Olaf ice cream cultures are positive for _Listeria_, we will await whole-gene sequencing (WGS) of the ice cream isolates to see if they match that of the outbreak strain. We're also awaiting WGS of the Florida Publix supermarket Vidalia onion _Listeria_ isolate to see if that genetically matches the outbreak strain. - Mod.ML

The timing of the recall is interesting as other reporting on 8 Jul 2022 (https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2022/07/big-olaf-ice-cream-owners-say-they-are-being-unfairly-targeted-in-investigation-of-deadly-outbreak/) indicated Big Olaf was not recalling its products and only recommending they not be sold. One hopes a recall is actually underway based on the CDC's announcement on 9 Jul 2022 that the establishment was the likely source of the outbreak. - Mod.JH
