re: ProMED Avian influenza (102): Europe (Belgium) HPAI-free status, OIE 20210822.8614555
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid any misperception amongst ProMED readers, please note that freedom from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a self-declared status, and the OIE Delegate of the declaring country assumes full responsibility for the information contained in the self-declaration. The OIE procedure before publication ensures all the elements of the international standards (OIE Code and Manual) are addressed in the self-declaration, but does not assume responsibility for their verification. This is addressed in the disclaimer attached to all self-declarations published by the OIE on our website.

This is distinct from the OIE Official Recognition of Status or Control Programmes, which is restricted to specific OIE Listed diseases (AHS [African horse sickness], BSE [bovine spongiform encephalopathy], CBPP [contagious bovine pleuropneumonia], CSF [classical swine fever], FMD [foot-and-mouth disease], PPR [peste des petits ruminants], rabies) and results in a Resolution endorsed by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates.

[OIE's valuable contribution above, clarifying the difference between "official freedom" of an animal disease and "self-declared" freedom of animal diseases, is gratefully acknowledged and appreciated. OIE's web pages addressing 'self-declared-disease-status', including a disclaimer and a link to the 'Standard Operating Procedure' (SOP) for countries wishing to self-declare the freedom from a disease of their country, zone, or compartment, are available at https://www.oie.int/en/what-we-do/animal-health-and-welfare/official-disease-status/self-declared-disease-status/.

A table including all self-declarations of (alphabetically presented) OIE member-countries, since 2000, last updated in January 2021, is available at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/05/eng-archive-2000-january-2021.pdf. According to the table, Belgium's self-declaration of countrywide freedom from HPAI was active between 29 Sep 2017 and 18 Nov 2020. Its recent re-activation is yet to be published in the said table. - Mod.AS
