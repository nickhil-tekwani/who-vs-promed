A new study by Harvard University explains a little more about colony collapse disorder (CCD), the name given to the sudden and widespread die-off of the honey bees that our food supply depends on for pollination. The findings may also explain why Texas beehives are doing better than those in other parts of the country.

Scientists have suspected for some time that a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids is responsible for CCD. But the new study, which is an extension of existing neonicotinoid research, suggests neonicotinoid-infected bees are dying of exposure to the cold.

Dr Alex Lu, associate professor of environmental exposure biology at Harvard School of Public Health, said the pesticide most likely causes a neurological problem. "In the honey bee study, they put a little bit of the neonicotinoid on a bee and they can track how quickly the bee comes back," Lu said. "And they found out that the amount of time for them to complete one trip is increased according to the dosage they give to them. Eventually the bee lost the way to go home." Lu said that the bees' ability to survive the cold is also diminished by the effects of the poison.

Lu said an EPA [US Environmental Protection Agency] study last year [2013] attributed colony collapse to several factors, including parasites and bacteria. But Lu refuted those findings, reasoning that if bees die from disease, the hives would be filled with dead bees. He said collapsed hives are empty. Lu said neonicotinoids are used extensively across the country, but Texas bees may not be dying off as extensively because the winters here are milder.

The abstract constitutes an excellent summary of the study and its implications:

"Honey bee (_Apis mellifera_ L.) colony collapse disorder (CCD) that appeared in 2005/2006 still lingers in many parts of the world. Here we show that sub-lethal exposure of neonicotinoids, imidacloprid or clothianidin, affected the winterization of healthy colonies that subsequently leads lo CCD. We found honey bees in both control and neonicotinoid-treated groups progressed almost identically through the summer and fall seasons and observed no acute morbidity or mortality in either group until the end of winter. Bees from 6 of the 12 neonicotinoid-treated colonies had abandoned their hives, and were eventually dead with symptoms resembling CCD. However, we observed a complete opposite phenomenon in the control colonics in which instead of abandonment, they were re-populated quickly with new emerging bees. Only one of the 6 control colonies was lost due to Nosema-like infection. The observations from this study may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which sub-lethal neonicotinoids exposure caused honey bees to vanish from their hives."

We are now one step closer to unveiling the web of causation underlying CCD. Instinctively, we are driven to look for a single culprit, but it is very likely that we are observing the output of a network of interacting factors. The culprit may not be a single pesticide or pathogens but many factors interacting in synergy. - Mod.PMB]
