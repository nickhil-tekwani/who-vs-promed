The CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections linked to hard-boiled eggs.

At a glance
-----------
Reported cases: 7
States: 5
Hospitalizations: 4
Deaths: 1
Recall: No

Advice for retailers, food service operators, and consumers
--------------------------------------------------------------
The CDC is concerned that bulk, fresh hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods of Gainesville, Georgia, are contaminated with _Listeria_ and have made people sick. These products were packaged in plastic pails for use nationwide by food service operators. These products have not been recalled. However, because _Listeria_ can cause severe infections, the CDC is warning against selling, serving, or using these eggs to make other food products.

Retailers and food service operators should know who supplies their bulk hard-boiled eggs. Consumers will not be able to tell if products they've purchased from stores contain these eggs, so it is important that people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infections follow the advice listed below.

Advice for retailers and food service operators:
- Retailers and food service operators should not use bulk hard-boiled eggs produced at the Almark Foods Gainesville, Georgia facility, regardless of use-by date.
- These eggs were peeled, hard-boiled, and packaged in plastic pails of various sizes. Food processors and manufacturers should not use these eggs to make ready-to-eat foods, such as egg salad, deviled eggs, or salads.
- These fresh hard-boiled eggs were packaged in plastic pails and have a 49-day shelf-life.
- Wash and sanitize any surfaces that may have come in contact with the eggs or the pail packaging. _Listeria_ can easily spread to other foods and surfaces.
- Retailers and food service operators should be aware of the following: This advice does not include Almark Foods hard-boiled eggs sold directly to consumers (https://www.almarkeggs.com/product-category/retail/hard-boiled-eggs/), or any other brands of hard-boiled eggs or products made with hard-boiled eggs. The data collected to date [have] not indicated that these products are linked to illness. This advice does not include eggs hard-boiled by retailers or restaurants.

Advice for people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection, such as pregnant women and their newborns, adults ages 65 or older, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer or on dialysis:
- Until we learn more, CDC advises that people at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection throw away any store-bought hard-boiled eggs or products containing hard-boiled eggs, such as egg salad. If you have these products at home, don't eat them. Throw them away, regardless of where you bought them or the use-by date.
- Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators and freezers where the products were stored. Follow these 5 steps to clean your refrigerator (see https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/communication/clean-refrigerator-steps.html). This advice does not include eggs hard-boiled at home or homemade products made with those eggs, such as egg salad or deviled eggs.
- If you buy products with hard-boiled eggs, or order or eat items with hard-boiled eggs at a restaurant: Before you buy, order, or eat, confirm with the store or restaurant that they do not use hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods. If they use hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods, don't buy or order the product. If they don't know where their hard-boiled eggs are from, don't buy or order the product.
- People at higher risk for _Listeria_ infection are much more likely than the general public to get sick after eating a food contaminated with this bacteria. People on dialysis are 50 times more likely to get a _Listeria_ infection. People with cancer and pregnant women are 10 times more likely than other people to get a _Listeria_ infection. Adults 65 and older are 4 times more likely to get an infection.

Latest outbreak information
-------------------------
- Seven people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 5 states. Four hospitalizations have been reported. One death has been reported from Texas.
- Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that bulk hard-boiled eggs from Almark Foods are a likely source of this outbreak.
- This investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness.
- The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

Investigation details
---------------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Listeria_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

As of 17 Dec 2019, a total of 7 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ have been reported from 5 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page (https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/eggs-12-19/map.html).

_Listeria_ specimens from ill people were collected from 10 Apr 2017 to 12 Nov 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 82 years, with a median age of 75. Seventy-one percent of ill people are male. Of 6 ill people with information available, 4 hospitalizations have been reported. One death has been reported from Texas. One illness was reported in a newborn who was infected with _Listeria_ while the mother was pregnant, but the newborn survived.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicates that bulk hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods of Gainesville, Georgia, are a likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the month before they became ill. Of the 5 people for whom information was available, 4 (80%) reported eating products containing eggs. Three of these people reported eating hard-boiled eggs in deli salads purchased from grocery stores and in salads eaten at restaurants.

In the PulseNet database, CDC noted 2 environmental samples from February 2019 that are closely related genetically to bacteria from ill people in this outbreak. The FDA reports that these samples were taken during a routine inspection of the Almark Foods facility (https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/almark-foods-inc-576633-07222019). These results provide additional evidence that people in this outbreak got sick from eating hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods.

Investigators are continuing to collect records from grocery stores and restaurants where ill people reported eating hard-boiled eggs. Investigations are ongoing to determine and document the distribution and production chain, as well as the source of hard-boiled eggs to the locations reported by ill people.

The CDC is concerned that bulk, fresh hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods of Gainesville, Georgia, are contaminated with _Listeria_ and have made people sick. These products were packaged in plastic pails for use nationwide by food service operators.

The investigation is ongoing to determine the source of contamination and if additional products are linked to illness. The CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[In the USA, the CDC identifies clusters of possibly related cases based on clinical isolates of _Listeria monocytogenes_, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (such as amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue) that have similar genotypes based on whole genome sequencing. These isolates had been forwarded to state public health laboratories for genotyping, the results of which had been submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance (https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/outbreak-detection/index.html). When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to identify a common source.

Once a cluster is identified, PulseNet also works with other federal food regulatory agencies -- the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) -- to find isolates found in food monitoring programs that have similar genotypes, which would implicate them as a common source.

The above alert issued by the CDC concerns 7 people who have been infected with the outbreak strain of _Listeria monocytogenes_ in 5 states from 10 Apr 2017 to 12 Nov 2019. One of the 7 people has died. Of cases for which information was available, 80% reported eating products containing eggs. Two "environmental samples" taken at the Almark Foods facility of Gainesville, Georgia, a producer of bulk hard-boiled eggs, during a routine inspection in February 2019 are reported above to be closely related genetically to the outbreak strain of _L. monocytogenes_, which provided additional evidence that "that people in this outbreak got sick from eating [bulk] hard-boiled eggs produced by Almark Foods." The FDA report (https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/almark-foods-inc-576633-07222019) specifies that one swab was collected at the Almark Foods facility from the peeling room floor drain and the other from "the egg counter entrance and stainless-steel area at the end of the conveyor belt", a location in contact with food. The FDA reports "the 2 isolates are genetically identical to 2 cases of human illness dating back to 2017." However, the CDC report above notes that these products have not been recalled. - Mod.ML
