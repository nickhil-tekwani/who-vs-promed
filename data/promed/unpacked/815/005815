One case of poliomyelitis has been reported in Mogadishu, Somalia where a
15-month-old girl had onset of paralysis on 12 Jul 2005. Genetic sequencing
is ongoing to determine the origin of the virus. Somalia had been
polio-free since 2002.
The Global Polio Eradication Initiative -- spearheaded by the World Health
Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF -- today launched an ambitious new
series of polio immunization campaigns to prevent the re-establishment of
the disease in the Horn of Africa.

The Global Polio Eradication Initiative -- spearheaded by the World Health
Organization (WHO), Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and UNICEF -- today launched an ambitious new
series of polio immunization campaigns to prevent the re-establishment of
the disease in the Horn of Africa. The new plan comes as a polio case is
confirmed in Mogadishu, Somalia, a country which had been polio-free since
2002.
The plan will see large-scale series of immunization campaigns coordinated
across 8 countries: Somalia, Ethiopia, Yemen, Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, and
parts of Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- between
September and November [2005]. The campaigns will reach more than 34
million children with multiple doses of polio vaccine and rapidly boost
population immunity in the Horn of Africa. The rapid and large-scale
response is largely possible due to a USD 25-million grant provided by the
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and support by other donors including the
Humanitarian Aid Department of the European Commission (ECHO).
The plan had been finalized over the past weeks, amid growing concern that
outbreaks in neighbouring Ethiopia and Yemen could spread across porous
borders with Somalia. Now, with confirmation of polio in Mogadishu, rapid
implementation of the emergency measures are essential. Although 5
nationwide campaigns were conducted this year, most recently in June, July
and August [2005] to prevent the risk of a large-scale epidemic, insecurity
in the country and low routine immunization rates could still result in
rapid spread of the virus across Somalia.
"The polio eradication initiative has shown the world that even in the
poorest countries, widespread and debilitating disease can be defeated,"
said Patty Stonesifer, Co-chair and President of the Bill & Melinda Gates
Foundation. "Today, as a resurgence of polio threatens to roll back the
amazing progress of the past 20 years, it is more important than ever that
governments and donors support the final push to eradicate polio."
The 1st phase of the plan is being launched on 28 Sep [2005] in Somalia,
where 1.5 million children under the age of 5 years will be targeted for
immunization. To maximise the impact of the campaigns, some of the
countries will be using the recently-developed monovalent oral polio
vaccine type 1 (mOPV1). Licensed earlier this year, also with support by
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, mOPV1 offers higher protection against
poliovirus type 1, the specific virus currently affecting the Horn of
Africa, with fewer doses than traditional trivalent polio vaccine.
Notes to editors: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative is spearheaded by
national governments, the World Health Organization (WHO), Rotary
International, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and
UNICEF. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a key partner in the global
effort to eradicate polio. In addition to this most recent USD 25 million
grant, the Foundation previously provided USD 85 million in funding,
including USD 10 million for the development of the monovalent oral polio
vaccine.
The polio case in Somalia occurred in Mogadishu. The case (a 15-month-old
girl) had onset of paralysis on 12 Jul 2005. Genetic sequencing is ongoing
to determine the origin of the virus.
Global eradication efforts have reduced the number of polio cases from 350
000 annually in 1988 to 1163 cases in 2005 (as of 6 Sep [2005]). 6
countries remain polio-endemic (Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
Niger and Egypt); however, poliovirus continues to spread to previously
polio-free countries. In total, 10 previously polio-free countries have
been re-infected in late 2004 and 2005 (Somalia, Indonesia, Yemen, Angola,
Ethiopia, Chad, Sudan, Mali, Eritrea and Cameroon).
Evidence from other recent outbreaks in west and central Africa and Yemen
confirms that rapid implementation of large-scale, high-quality
immunization campaigns can rapidly stop epidemics in previously polio-free
countries.

[The above reports mention the confirmation of a case in Somalia with date
of onset in July 2005 and another case in Eritrea that we have not
previously been aware of. Both cases are felt to be importations related
to the ongoing wild poliovirus circulation in Africa.
According to the polio eradication website, as of 6 Sep 2005 there have
been 1163 cases of polio reported in 2005. A table from that website is
produced below, showing the number of cases reported by country and by
epidemiologic classification of outbreak. Transmission is considered
re-established after 6 months of continued wild poliovirus circulation and
cases. We do not have further information on the reported case in Eritrea
other than the date of onset of the case was in April 2005, it was a wild
poliovirus type 1 (although genetic origin is not reported), and it is
considered an imported case under investigation.
The continued importation of wild poliovirus into countries that had
successfully interrupted wild poliovirus circulation is a major setback to
the goals of the polio eradication initiative. However, it does serve as a
wake-up call that interruption of wild poliovirus circulation in a country
should not result in a reduction in polio vaccination activities until
there has been interruption of wild poliovirus circulation worldwide. - Mod.MPP
