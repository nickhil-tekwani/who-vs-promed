A low pathogenic strain of avian influenza has been found on a single
turkey farm in Sampson County, North Carolina. According to Dow Jones
Newswires, the strain was H3N3, which presents no threat to humans,
and was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory on
28 Nov 2005. Despite the virus being found on the farm, no birds were
reported as ill.

[Low pathogenic avian influenza is spread through direct contact of
infected birds and healthy birds. The virus may also be transmitted
by contact with contaminated materials and equipment. Infected birds
excrete viral particles in the feces as well as nasal, oral, and
ophthalmic secretions.
