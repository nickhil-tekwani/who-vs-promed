Six people have tested positive for leptospirosis, the dreaded bacterial infection, in the last few days in the city [of Pune], doctors said on Wednesday [3 Aug 2022]. The condition of one of them, a woman, is critical.

"The woman is a homemaker from Kasba Peth [the oldest residential sector in Pune], whose liver and lungs have been severely affected. At a time when our wards and intensive care units are filled with patients infected with H1N1, dengue and COVID-19 cases, leptospirosis is one more addition," said KEM hospital's senior physician Dr Rajesh Gadia. Dr Gadia has come across 4 patients with a lab-confirmed diagnosis of leptospirosis in the last few days. "One was a 40 year old mutton shop operator from Kondhwa," he said. Two other patients were from Somwar Peth.

Leptospirosis, a disease often associated with farmers and animal handlers, has left 6 unwell and one among them critical in the city. "Finding cases in the city areas is considered unusual. But in view of the presence of stray animals on the city's roads and rodents in the sewage, citizens can come in direct contact with water or food contaminated with animal urine and feces, resulting in leptospirosis," said Gadia.

The common way of contracting the infection is urine or contaminated water getting into a person's eyes, nose, mouth or broken skin (a cut or a scratch). "People can also get infected by consuming contaminated food or water. Some people with leptospirosis show no symptoms," he said. Critical care expert Dr Subhal Dixit of Sanjeevan Hospital, Karvenagar, said, "I recently treated a patient from Kasba Peth for leptospirosis. He had moderate symptoms and recovered in a few days."

Leptospirosis can cause a wide range of symptoms, some of which may be mistaken for other diseases. "If left untreated, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis (inflammation of the membrane around the brain and spinal cord), liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death," said Sahyadri hospital's critical care expert Dr Kapil Borawake. He treated a patient from Hadapsar 2 weeks ago. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, a senior health official of the PMC, told TOI, "People must be cautious while wading through rainwater. If it is contaminated with leptospira bacteria and a person has cuts/scratches on the legs, s/he may develop the disease."

Health activist Dr Sanjay Dabhade said, "The city's drainage lines are infested with rodents. Their body wastes spill out on the roads during the rains when the lines get choked, exposing citizens to the infection."

The city [Mumbai] on Tuesday [2 Aug 2022] saw the first death due to a rain-related illness this monsoon, with sources saying that a 49 year old man from Santacruz East had succumbed to leptospirosis. The BrihanMumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, said its death review committee will ascertain what claimed the man's life. Mumbai saw 65 leptospirosis cases in July [2022] of which about half were reported in the past 7 days. The casualty comes amid an increase in cases of monsoon ailments like swine flu, dengue and leptospirosis in Mumbai.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that spreads through the infected urine of animals like rats, dogs, cats and buffalo. Humans can get the disease through direct contact with urine from infected animals or through water, soil or food contaminated with their urine. The bacteria can invade the body through cuts in the skin as well as the nose, mouth, or genitals.

After heavy rain in the first 15 days of July [2022] left many areas waterlogged, officials had expected a rise in leptospirosis cases. While the city reported 34 leptospirosis cases in the first 24 days of last month [July], it saw 31 cases between 25 and 31 Jul [2022].

Dr Nitin Karnik, professor and head of department (medicine) at Sion hospital said, "We see cases of leptospirosis, dengue, and malaria each day. We found that people are coming with complaints of high fever and loose motion which is something unusual. Usually, people have red eyes, fever and body ache and some develop jaundice and renal failure." Dr Karnik said many patients visit the hospital only after the disease has progressed and they struggle to breathe. "People who have a history of wading through water and have the above symptoms must consult a doctor without wasting time," he said.

On the death of the Santacruz man, a BMC official said, "Though his report was positive for leptospirosis, there might be some other reason for the death. Our death review committee will take a final call on suspected cases."

Dr Madhukar Gaikwad, head of Medicine at JJ hospital, said, "We are seeing a rise in leptospirosis cases. About 10% of the patients can develop a haemorrhagic fever in which the skin and eyes become dark yellow. It can lead to bleeding and kidney failure."

How to prevent leptospirosis infection:
- Avoid touching water or soil that may be contaminated with animal urine
- Avoid touching objects that may be contaminated with animal urine or animal bedding
- Don't wade, swim, or put your head in floodwaters or water from lakes, rivers, or swamps
- If it is not possible to avoid wading through floodwaters, wear protective clothing like footwear and cover cuts and wounds with waterproof bandages or dressing
- Drink boiled water and wash vegetables properly

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of leptospira-infected animals or by contact with water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospira may survive in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water for weeks to months. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection.

In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospira are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic leptospira. Mice, as well as rats, can carry leptospira in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Prevalence of particular leptospiral serovars vary by geographical region.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, gardening or farming, and working in piggeries. Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with occupations or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever.

Leptospirosis is also a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from leptospira-infected animals (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). However, laboratory diagnosis for leptospirosis may not be not widely available at a local level. Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is a port city on the western coast of India, with a total metropolitan area population of about 20.5 million (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai). It is the capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra and is always badly hit during the monsoon season (June to September), with heaviest rainfall in July and August. Pune, an inland city, considered to be the cultural capital of the Indian state of Maharashtra, with a population of about 3.1 million residents, is the 2nd largest city in Maharashtra and the 9th most populous city in the country (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pune#Museums.2C_parks_and_zoos). - Mod.ML
