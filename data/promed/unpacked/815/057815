The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 6 Nov 2018:
- A total of 308 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 273 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 273 confirmed, 156 died and 91 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 39 suspected cases under investigation.
- 3 new confirmed cases, 2 in Beni and 1 in Vuhovi [North Kivu].
- 2 new confirmed fatalities, including 1 in Butembo [North Kivu] and 1 in Vuhovi.
- 3 new recoveries in Beni.

News of the response
High level visit to Beni
------------------------
- The response teams in Beni were visited by a large delegation composed of the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, the Governor of North Kivu Province, Julien Paluku, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping operations, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and the UN Special Representative in the DRC, Leila Zerrougui.
- The delegation began the day at the emergency operations center of the response, where National Response Coordinator Dr Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe presented the epidemiological situation, challenges and progress of the response. The Coordinator agreed, on behalf of all stakeholders in the response, with the Merit Certificate awarded to congratulate them on the work done in this Ebola outbreak, which is the most complex epidemic in the history of the country.
- The delegation then went to the town hall where it met the Beni security committee to take stock of the security situation and the civil society of Beni who shared the point of view of the inhabitants of the city in relation to the Ebola outbreak and the security situation.
- The guests closed their visit with a meeting with Beni's sub-coordination teams and a visit to the site of the transit center under construction, which will house the numerous suspected cases detected every day before their transfer to the ETC in the event of a positive laboratory test. The surveillance teams receive, on average, 100 alerts per day, of which about 30 become suspect cases to investigate, collect, and isolate. The opening of the transit center will unload the 60-bed ETC, which is currently full.
- At the end of the visit, the Minister of Health warmly congratulated the teams that have so far managed to prevent this epidemic from turning into a real human tragedy, resulting in thousands of deaths across the country. Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga said he was reassured by the positive progress made since the refocusing of the response plan and the new directions taken last October [2018]. Although the number of new confirmed cases reported daily has slightly decreased in recent days, the situation remains extremely critical and it is not time to give up. On the contrary, it is during these apparent lull times that teams must redouble their efforts to identify and isolate cases still in the community and avoid a new outbreak.

Insecurity
----------
- A team of 3 civil protection agents and one epidemiologist was taken hostage by a group of Mai-Mai rebels at the village of Matembo, located on the road between Beni and Butembo [North Kivu], while preparing a dignified and secure burial. A community death had occurred in the village and the family had called the emergency services. Arriving at the scene, the team proceeded to the decontamination of the house, the removal of the body of the deceased, and the preparation of the body for burial. It was at this point that the rebels entered the village and took the 4 response team agents hostage. The alert was relayed to the security commission coordination, which then sent police to release the hostages. Fortunately, the hostages were found safe and sound.

[See Helen Branswell's tweet (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1060308795316953091): "The team [of 3 civil protection agents and 1 epidemiologist] had gone to a village between Beni & Butembo to check out a situation where someone had died of what might have been #Ebola (it was not). This just underscores how much danger responders there face hourly."

It is also worth reading the first-hand account of a health care worker in the DRC (ProMED-mail Ebola update (126): Congo DR (NK, IT) cases, fear, summary 20181107.6130618).

The situation is dire and distressing. Ebola virus will continue to spread unless vaccinations and surveillance can proceed unimpeded by the danger of working in the region. - Mod.LK]

Ebola case count rises as Uganda health workers vaccinated
--------------------------------------
In the latest weekly situation report on the ongoing Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the World Health Organization (WHO) said half of all recent deaths are taking place in the community -- a worrisome sign.

Community deaths, which occur outside of a hospital or Ebola treatment center, threaten to extend the transmission chain of a given case and further accelerate the mounting case count.

The WHO also said that 2 of the recent cases in Beni [North Kivu]were in nurses, bringing the total of healthcare workers infected during this outbreak to 27, including 26 confirmed and 3 deaths. And vaccination efforts have expanded to front-line healthcare workers in neighboring Uganda, the agency noted.

Also today [7 Nov 2018], the WHO said on its Ebola outbreak dashboard there were 3 new cases of Ebola, bringing the outbreak total to 308, including 191 deaths.

As of 4 Nov 2018, the case-fatality ratio (CFR) of the outbreak was 62% (186/300). But with more than 30 cases reported in the week of 30 Oct 2018 and this week [week of 6 Nov 2018], that percentage could be higher. The outbreak has affected women in greater numbers, with 59% of cases occurring in females, the WHO said. The majority (59%) of cases have also been in teens and younger adults, ages 15-44.

A total of 88 patients (as of 4 Nov 2018) have recovered, and 91 remain hospitalized at Ebola treatment centers.

About half of all cases in this outbreak have originated in Beni, which has been the site of violence from rebel armed forces who have opposed outbreak response efforts.

"The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis, with over one million internally displaced people and continuous movement of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi, and Tanzania," the WHO said.

Vaccination, surveillance efforts still under way
-------------------------------------------------
Health officials have tracked more than 16 000 case contacts during this outbreak, of which more than 4000 are still being traced. On average, health workers on the ground are getting 161 alerts of potential cases each day; about 52 cases per day are validated as suspected cases.

"Over the past week, high contact follow-up rates were achieved (ranging 90-92% per day)," the WHO said. However, a large proportion of newly identified cases continue to be detected among individuals who were not previously identified as contacts."

The surveillance activities go hand in hand with the ongoing implementation of a ring vaccination campaign in the DRC. As of 4 Nov 2018, officials have identified 168 rings, and approximately 27 000 people in the DRC have been vaccinated against the virus, including at least 9105 healthcare workers and 7006 children.

Today [7 Nov 2018] health officials in Uganda announced that the 1st wave of health officials have been vaccinated in Ntoroko district, which borders the DRC, according to a WHO news release. Workers in 5 other high-risk districts bordering the DRC will also be vaccinated.

So far, no Ugandans have contracted the virus during this outbreak.
