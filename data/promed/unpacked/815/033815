Russia: viral meningitis outbreak in Khabarovsk Region - update
---------------------------------------------------------------
17 children in the age range 7 to 12 years have been admitted to hospital
with viral meningitis [also known as serous or aseptic meningitis] in the
Khabarovsk region. The first sick child was admitted to hospital about 2
weeks ago [approx. 9 Jul 2005]. At present 9 cases of viral meningitis have
been notified in Khabarovsk; 3 in Komsomolsk-na-Amure, 2 in Nanaian
district, and one each in the Khabarovskiy, Bikinskiy, and Nikolaevskiy
