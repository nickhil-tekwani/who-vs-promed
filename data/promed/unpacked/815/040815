Pillar Point Harbor near this seaside town is turning into an anchovy
graveyard. Thousands of the silvery fish are beaching themselves, and
fishermen and scientists are trying to figure out why. It could be an
annual die-off or caused by a red-tide bloom, they say.
Each year, anchovies come in close to shore to spawn, and there are so many
they sap the oxygen from the water, killing themselves, said John Draper,
assistant harbor master at Pillar Point.
Biologist John Mello of the state Department of Fish and Game said it could
be the case or it could be a red tide bloom, which is caused by single-cell
plankton. The plankton, which turn the water a brownish-red, use up oxygen
and are toxic to certain fish, including anchovies.
Mike McHenry, a commercial anchovy fisherman for 40 years, estimated the
total die-off to be around 3000 tons so far. "This is about a 10-year
ordeal we see, although I saw a similar die-off 3 years ago, but not to
this extent," he said.
The anchovies are not the first fish to die out recently in the area,
McHenry said. Perch, halibut and kingfish are also suffering from the lack
of oxygen. McHenry recently tried to get permission to fish anchovies in
the Farallon National Wildlife Refuge to use as fish-hatchery bait and
fertilizer, but the Pacific Fisheries Management Council denied him.
