[Since 2009, Italy has reported the largest number of outbreaks in
horses with 95 in 2010 and more than 100 in 2009. The greatest numbers
have occurred in the later half of the year, with a significant uptick
in September of 2009. So, the occurrence pattern appears to be right
on schedule in Italy. Outbreaks in humans have been reported in the
north of Italy already this year (2011) -- see ProMED-mail West Nile
virus - Eurasia (07): Italy (VN) 20110821.2542. So, it appears as if
humans were acting as sentinels for the horses this year. - Mod.PC

In Spain, West Nile virus was identified in both 2009 and 2010 but
there wasn't any quantitative information in the OIE WAHID database.
Additionally, Greece is currently experiencing an outbreak in both
horses and people, and Russia is experiencing an outbreak in people
but with no reports of outbreaks in horses, which may indicate a lack
of surveillance in the equine population.

Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Hungary, Portugal, and Romania have
reported at least the presence of West Nile since 2009, so those may
be countries to watch this season. - Mod.PC]
