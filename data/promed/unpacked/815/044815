Due to the outbreak of an unknown disease/epidemic, hundreds of
cattle and livestock, including cows, bulls, buffaloes and their
calves, have been reportedly dying over the last 3 weeks at Nungba
area in Manipur's Tamenglong district.

G Poukhuilung, president of Nungba Area Village Authority
Association, in a memorandum to the Minister of Veterinary and Animal
Husbandry, sought the government's help. Responding to his
memorandum, a team of state veterinary doctors have also rushed to
the hill district along with the necessary medicines.

However, there's no report confirming the details of the disease that
hit the remote hill villages up to the time of the filing of this report.

In the absence of information on the clinical signs, age and
husbandry of the affected animals, PM changes and results of any
laboratory tests applied, there is no room for hypotheses on the
background to this event, which can have infectious etiology or
otherwise. Zoonotic disease agents should be taken into consideration
as well. Such information is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
