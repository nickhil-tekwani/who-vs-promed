Hypotheses derived from jungle virology analogies and experience
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Charlie Calisher's questions [see; West Nile virus surveillance - USA:
questions 2000.3089 have never been easy to answer! The following are still
not answers to some of his questions, but working hypotheses derived from
jungle virology analogies and experience.
As an old virologist who conducted viral surveillance in tropical rain
forests, I remember that each level of the canopy has its own ecology and
mosquito species and variants tend to feed at defined levels. I ignore
whether this is true for the mosquito species involved in the transmission
of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America. However, assuming that crows are
the most important American host for WNV, one would presume that the _Culex_
species primarily feeding on them would be doing so early in the morning and
late in the afternoon. During these times crows are likely to be either
returning to their feeding areas or flocking to roost, and in either case
they are more likely to be perched on trees than hopping on the ground.
Therefore, one wonders whether mosquitoes feeding on crows at these levels
would readily fly down to feed on chicken at ground level and whether the
efficiency of chicken flocks as sentinel birds for WNV might not be
increased if they were elevated from ground to crow roosting levels. If the
mosquito does not come down to the chicken, then make the chicken come up to
the mosquito!
Lethargic howler monkeys infected with YFV fall from the canopy and bring
down hemagogus mosquitoes creating the conditions for humans to become
infected. Using this jungle analogy, it is likely that sick birds falling to
the ground would bring with them their mosquitoes and that being close to a
sick bird that just fell to the ground (particularly from its roosting site
at dusk, when mosquitoes are likely to be most active) may particularly
increase the risk of human beings becoming infected.

More on chickens
----------------
I found it ironic that the last paragraph of a recent posting [WEST NILE
VIRUS SURVEILLANCE - USA (25) reads...The total number of West Nile
positive specimens for New York State this year is 202 birds, 87 mosquito
pools, 1 sentinel chicken and 3 human cases. This suggests to me that
humans are serving as an effective sentinel for the chickens. However, we
have seen in previous postings that the Canadians have set up a chicken
perimeter. If dead crows and other birds are such effective indicators,
perhaps they may consider shifting their efforts while there is still time.

Some denominators
-----------------
The point was made by Charlie Calisher that we were seeing a great many
more numerators than denominators. Some denominators are now available at
the Connecticut State West Nile virus (WNV) website:
<http://dep.state.ct.us/mosquito/tstrslt.asp> which and can be accessed
from the ProMED-mail WNV Links page. They are derived as follows: "All
mosquitoes for the week of 8 Aug 2000 are negative for WNV and Eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE) virus, with the identification of a positive
isolation of WNV from Stamford already reported on 21 Jul 2000. Overall,
7227 mosquitoes (collected from 18 Jul through 27 Jul 2000) were tested
from 71 permanent state-wide sites as well as 3 supplemental sites in
Greenwich (1) and Stamford (2). In addition, the State will be placing 6
mosquito traps in 3 locations in Cheshire to test and assess mosquito
populations and test for WNV and EEE virus".
These figures indicate a minimum field infection rate (MIF) of 1:7000 for
the Stamford area. There may be something in the literature to indicate
whether that level has been significant in past St. Louis encephalitis
virus outbreaks.
Over the past week, an increase has been noticed in daily mosquito
collections rising from an average of 1000 a day to 4000 a day. Most are
floodwater mosquitoes from the recent rain.
Statewide, 70 000 mosquitoes have been tested, all negative for WNV or EEE
with the identification of a positive isolation of WNV from Stamford
already reported.

Some responses to points raised by Eleanor Kellon in West Nile virus
surveillance - USA: Questions (04)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) "I would like to know why sporadic spraying efforts should give anyone a
sense of security......?".
After each spray, a large number of adult mosquitoes, including infected
adults, are killed. Adults emerging post-spray have to find a blood meal. If
they find an infected bird, it still takes a few days for the virus to pass
from the gut to the salivary glands, plus the mosquito may not need another
blood meal until after it has matured and laid its eggs, so there cannot be
any transmission for a few days. Hence daily spraying is not necessary.
(2) "......it is not always/usually clear what test results are being used
to "confirm" West Nile virus (WNV) infection".
That may be so in the context of human infection, but Dr Laura Kramer of
the New York State Wadsworth Center's Arbovirus Laboratory has made it
absolutely clear what tests are being used in the State lab for confirming
WNV infection in birds and mosquitoes -- see: West Nile virus, crow - USA
(New York) (05) subsection.
(3) I can only assume that if a single CSF IgM is being used, [diagnosis
must be based on presumption..........
CDC has shown that WNV IgM lasts more than 200 days in some cases, so it may
persist since last year's outbreak. The post-epidemic survey in Queens showed
that hundreds of people had been infected without being ill. What is missing
from the information handed out is the titer of the IgM antibody. In old
cases this should be lower then in current cases.
(4) A pressing need is to find an effective vaccine.
There is no licensed vaccine available for Eastern or Western equine or St.
Louis encephalitis, which together kill each year perhaps as many people as
were killed by WNV last year. Unless there is a huge demand, there will be
no commercial incentive to produce the vaccine.

A further question from Eleanor Kellon
--------------------------------------
In "West Nile virus Surveillance - USA (26)" New York City Health
Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D. was quoted as saying on Aug 17 that " This
morning 23 mosquito pools from Staten Island, 3 mosquito pools from Central
Park, Manhattan, one mosquito pool from Hunts Point in the Bronx, one crow
from Northern Manhattan, one crow from Central Park and one crow from
Whitestone, Queens have tested positive for West Nile virus. These findings
were reported to the City Health Department yesterday by the New York State
Department of Health. As a result of this information, the City will apply
pesticides to reduce the number of potentially infected mosquitoes at
several locations city-wide over the next several days.
Whereas an Associated Press report dated Wednesday 16 Aug indicated that
"Health officials are escalating the battle against the West Nile virus with
a one-two punch of ground spraying and the season's first aerial spraying.
After another round of ground spraying on Wednesday evening, the first
aerial assault, with the pesticide Anvil, is scheduled for Thursday night on
Staten Island and in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn".
I am assuming from the fact (1) that they didn't specifically mention that
the positives were samples collected before spraying, and (2) that the
decision has been made to add aerial spray, that the most recent positives,
including the large number of positive mosquito pools on Staten island, were
collected after ground spraying had commenced.
Can anyone confirm this?
