[The following open access publication reports the partial
characterisation of novel human cardioviruses associated with
gastrointestinal tract infections, and demonstrates the power of a
pan-viral DNA microarray (Virochip; University of California, San
Francisco) technique designed to detect known and novel viruses in
clinical specimens on the basis of homology to conserved regions of
known viral sequences. Previously the Virochip has been used
successfully to detect novel pathogens such as the severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and other disease-producing
agents. - Mod.CP]

Abstract: Cardioviruses comprise a genus of picornaviruses that cause
severe illnesses in rodents, but little is known about the
prevalence, diversity, or spectrum of disease of such agents among
humans. A single cardiovirus isolate, Saffold virus, was cultured in
1981 in stool from an infant with fever. Here, we describe the
identification of a group of human cardioviruses that have been
cloned directly from patient specimens, the 1st of which was detected
using a pan-viral microarray in respiratory secretions from a child
with influenza-like illness. Phylogenetic analysis of the nearly
complete viral genome (7961 bp) revealed that this virus belongs to
the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) subgroup of
cardioviruses and is most closely related to Saffold virus.
Subsequent screening by RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction] of 719 additional respiratory specimens [637 (89
percent) from patients with acute respiratory illness] and 400
cerebrospinal fluid specimens from patients with neurological disease
(aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis) revealed
no evidence of cardiovirus infection. However, screening of 751 stool
specimens from 498 individuals in a gastroenteritis cohort resulted
in the detection of 6 additional cardioviruses (1.2 percent).
Although all 8 human cardioviruses (including Saffold virus)
clustered together by phylogenetic analysis, significant sequence
diversity was observed in the VP1 gene (66.9 percent-100 percent
pairwise amino acid identities). These findings suggest that there
exists a diverse group of novel human Theiler's murine
encephalomyelitis virus-like cardioviruses that hitherto have gone
largely undetected, are found primarily in the gastrointestinal
tract, can be shed asymptomatically, and have potential links to
enteric and extra intestinal disease.

[The following background information has been extracted from the
text of the paper.

The 1st candidate human cardiovirus was Vilyuisk virus, which was
linked to Vilyuisk encephalitis, an unusual neurodegenerative disease
found among the Yakuts people of Siberia in the 1950s and still
endemic to the region. The Vilyuisk virus was initially isolated from
the cerebrospinal fluid of an affected patient and underwent 41
serial passages in mice before sequencing and characterization as a
Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV)-like picornavirus. Given
its sequence similarity to TMEV and its extensive passage history in
mice, questions have arisen as to whether the virus may in fact be of
murine origin.

In 1981, another TMEV-related cardiovirus was cultured from the stool
of an infant who presented with a febrile illness. Although early
passages appeared to show that the virus was transmissible, long-term
continuous propagation of the isolate has been problematic. The
nearly complete genomic sequence of this isolate (provisionally
called Saffold virus) was recovered from frozen stocks by cloning in
2007 and was found to be much more divergent from TMEV than Vilyuisk
virus. However, neither Vilyuisk nor Saffold virus was cloned
directly from primary clinical specimens, and the diversity,
prevalence, and potential clinical manifestations of human
cardiovirus infection have remained largely unexplored. The
publication by Chiu et al is the 1st report of the presence of
cardioviruses in primary clinical specimens.

It is presently unclear how frequently enteric cardioviral infection
produces clinical illness. Moreover, cardioviruses were detected in
stool from subjects without enteritis, suggesting that asymptomatic
shedding of cardioviruses in the gastrointestinal tract can and does
occur. Further studies will be required to define the pathogenic role
of cardiovirus infection in the intestine. Although a cardiovirus was
recovered from a number of cases with symptomatic enteritis, other
potential gastrointestinal pathogens were also detected in some
cases. Thus, it is presently unclear how frequently enteric
cardioviral infection produces clinical illness.

A surprising finding from this study was the diversity of the human
cardioviruses that have been identified. For the family
_Picornaviridae_, the definition of a new species in a genus is
having 70 percent amino acid identity in the coding regions of either
VP1, 2C, 3C, or 3D. By this strict definition, cardioviruses UC2 and
UC5 would classify as a novel species distinct from Saffold virus,
with 66.9 percent amino acid identity in the VP1 gene. However,
cardioviruses UC1 through UC7 and Saffold virus as a whole clearly
define a separate group within the genus _Cardiovirus_ by
phylogenetic analysis.

Several lines of evidence support that these human cardioviruses are
bona fide human viruses and not the products of sporadic viral
crossover events from rodents to humans since no rodent TMEV
sequences were detected in 1870 total clinical specimens. - Mod.CP]
