2000/008 Corrections to PQR 3.9, Quarantine Pests for Europe, Maps of
Quarantine Pests for Europe
After further inquiries, it appears that the record of _Puccinia
pittieriana_ (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) in BOLIVIA is erroneous.
[_P. pittieriana_ is a fungal pathogen which causes a rust disease on
potato. There is a quarantine against its entry into the UK. Does anyone
have information about this pathogen and the disease that it induces? -Mod.
DH
As mentioned in EPPO RS 98/024, _Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3, biovar 2
(EPPO A2 quarantine pest) was found on potatoes in Nagasaki, JAPAN, which
is located on the island of Kyushu (not Honshu as appearing in PQR). This
will be corrected in the next version of PQR.
