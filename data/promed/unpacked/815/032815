There have been 217 cases in a new foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] outbreak since 29 Sep 2015, Faruk Celik, minister for food, agriculture and livestock said on 16 Dec 2015.

Speaking at a press conference, Celik said 117 of these outbreaks are under control while 100 others are still active.

"We don't need to panic, as we have been taking all necessary actions to keep the disease under control," Celik said, as quoted by Anadolu Agency.

These actions included producing vaccines for the virus, he added.

Celik said the virus had 1st been detected in the eastern Van province.

Since then, 10 km (6.2 miles) around the affected area have been quarantined, with livestock barred from both leaving and entering the area.

Livestock in the area have been vaccinated and livestock markets have been closed.

"We have produced 4.6 million doses of vaccine so far and sent them to all the provinces," Celik said.

"As foot-and-mouth disease has spread over several countries other than Turkey, the European Commission for the Control of FMD [EuFMD] of the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] of the U.N. has taken action. The commission has requested 5 million doses of the vaccine to be made by Turkey so far. We will do our best to battle this disease in these affected countries," the minister said.

Meanwhile, the livestock market of the Central Anatolian province of Eskisehir was closed down on 15 Dec 2015 due to a number of cases detected, as reported by Dogan News Agency.

The Province Animal Health Control Commission said the market will be closed until a 2nd notification in a written statement.

"A new virus, which has been unseen in Turkey, was detected in Van in September [2015] and this virus, which has spread at a rapid pace, was 1st seen in our province on [23 Nov 2015]," said the statement, adding that new cases were then detected in other districts.

"As we have seen the virus spread in a very rapid manner both in Eskisehir and in our neighboring provinces, and some cases have been seen in the Tepebasi district where our cattle market is located, a commission was established under the leadership of Vice Governor Bekir Sahin Tutuncu to discuss the issue. The commission has decided to close down the market to prevent further infections," added the statement.

A number of provinces and districts have also been imposing quarantines to thwart the spread of the infection since September [2015].

[On 6 Nov 2015, Turkey informed EuFMD Secretariat on the occurrence of 2 FMD outbreaks due to a new serotype A strain, topotype Asia, lately named "Genotype VII". Since then, there have been a total of 3 outbreaks of the new FMD virus from 3 provinces, namely. Van & Bitils (south-east) and Amasya (north) were reported to OIE; the most recent follow-up report was submitted on 30 Nov 2015. Links to the OIE reports and a map showing the 3 outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=19092. The above information means underreporting.

According to the genotyping results of the new Turkish FMDV-A strain, published by the WRLFMD (Pirbright), this strain is closely related to recent Saudi strains and to FMDV-A strains from the Indian subcontinent, including a recent strain from Bangladesh.

The 5 most closely related virus strains are the following:

No. // Virus name // Identity (percentage) // Topotype // strain
1 // A/SAU/1/2015 // 98.28 // ASIA // genotype VII
2 // A/SAU/2/2015 // 98 .28 // ASIA // genotype VII
3 // A/BAN/GA/Sa-197/2013 (KJ754939) // 95.15 // ASIA // genotype VII
4 // A/IND/161/2003* (HQ832578) // 93.27 // ASIA // genotype VII
5 // A/IND/249/2004* (HQ832582) // 93.27 // ASIA // genotype VII

The above and further genotyping details are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2015/WRLMEG-2015-00019%20A%20Turkey%202015%20v2.pdf.

Complete Genome Sequence of the FMD Virus Type A strain from Bangladesh has been reported by Huzzat Ullah, Mohammad Anwar Siddique et al in Genome Announc. 2014 May-Jun; 2(3): e00506-14, published online 2014 Jun 12, available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4056291/. Their abstract follows.

Abstract
"The complete genome sequence of a foot-and-and mouth disease virus (FMDV) type A strain (BAN/GA/Sa-197/2013), isolated from Gazipur in Bangladesh, revealed an 84-nucleotide insertion within the 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a lengthened poly(C) tract, and amino acid substitutions at the VP1 region compared to the available genome sequence of the vaccine strain (GenBank accession no. HM854025)."

Information on the vaccine strain included in the vaccine produced by the Turkish FMD institute, and in particular the results of matching studies defining its protection capacity against the new field strain, will be much appreciated.

Turkey is expected to submit updated information on the number and locations of the outbreaks accumulated since its last follow-up report, as well as information on the morbidity and mortality rates and species affected. This information is of particular significance for adjacent countries, including the continent of Europe where FMD vaccination has been discontinued since 1992.

FMD is endemic in Turkey, with the exception of the Thrace region. In the rest of the country 65 outbreaks have been reported in the period January-June 2015 (WAHID). - Mod.AS
