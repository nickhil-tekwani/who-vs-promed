After Dr Castellanos' information about dengue in Dom. Rep. I think there
is not too much to add. The Department of Virology of the Central
Veterinary Laboratory had made 5 isolations of dengue viruses of the
following serotypes: 3 of dengue 2; 1 of dengue 1, and 1 of dengue 4. All
this from a total of 51 samples cultured.
Until this moment dengue 3 virus has not been isolated. Samples were
inoculated into mosquito cell line C636 (from mosquito _Aedes albopictus_)
then incubated 5-7 days. These cells are cultured in Leighton tubes for 48
hours until a monolayer is formed, then are inoculated with 30 mcl [0.03
ml of serum per tube.
Virus detection is by direct immunofluorescence using a polyclonal
conjugate that reacts with almost all flaviviruses. [By these methods our
lab made the first dengue virus isolation in our country.

[Strictly speaking, these may be the first dengue viruses isolated in the
Dominican Republic but I recall that Joel Ehrenkranz and Arnoldo Ventura
isolated dengue viruses from bloods collected in the D.R. in the 1060's.
There may have been others. Nonetheless, local control of specimens and
tests is always appropriate and, as the buzz word goes, "empowering". -
