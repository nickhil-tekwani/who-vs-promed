USA: Washington Nursing Facility Affected by Norovirus Infection
----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of norovirus infection has occurred at a nursing facility
in Northwest D.C. A spokeswoman at the facility called The Washington
Home says that the outbreak of [gastroenteritis] began about 2 weeks
ago, but the number of people who have come down with it has
increased in the past few days.
The Washington Home has reportedly stopped admitting new patients
until further notice, and visits have been suspended until the
illness is brought under control. Nursing homes in Northern Virginia
were recently hit by an outbreak of a similar illness also believed
to have been caused by norovirus infection.
At Terra Centre Elementary in Burke, officials cleaned the building
last month after about 50 children apparently came down with the
illness.

USA: Raw Oysters Responsible for Norovirus Outbreak in Texas
--------------------------------------------------
Contaminated raw oysters sickened dozens of conventioneers in
Galveston during February 2004, the county health district announced
on Wed 17 Mar 2004. Norovirus was detected in stool specimens from 2
cases.
This virus has been implicated in numerous other food-related
outbreaks, often from raw or under-cooked seafood. In many cases we
are unable to determine the cause of an outbreak, but in this case we
were able to do so due to rapid reporting and investigating, said
Chuck Chambers, a health district epidemiologist.
Most people will recover from a norovirus infection within a few days
but may experience symptoms which can be severe. Good hygiene,
especially hand washing, is important in preventing the spread of
this type of illness.
The oysters were served at a catered meal at the Lone Star Flight
Museum on 27 Feb 2004. Most of the 47 people who fell ill at the
National Trooper Coalition convention had eaten the oysters. Chambers
said the investigation showed the caterers handled the oysters
properly. The oysters came from a part of Galveston Bay subsequently
closed to harvesting by state health authorities. The health district
declined to identify the caterers but said they were based outside
Galveston County.

USA: Number of Norovirus Cases among Guests at Hotel in Las Vegas Rises
--------------------------------------------------
[Previously the number of cases reported by the Honolulu Advertiser
on 10 Mar 2004 was 284 for the period from 3 Dec 2003 to 8 Mar 2004 -
see the ProMED-mail post: "Viral gastroenteritis update 2004 (09)
20040313.0697". - Mod.CP]
Now the Health Department in Las Vegas says that since 3 Dec 2003 as
many as 1174 people who stayed at the California Hotel and Casino
have reported suffering from norovirus infection. The number has been
rising as more people come forward after seeing news reports on the
outbreak. Officials say most of those sickened are Hawaii residents.
Boyd Gaming Corp., which owns the California Hotel, sells many Las
Vegas packages to people in Hawaii.
Noroviruses can cause diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting for 24 to
48 hours. The virus is spread through food, water, and close contact
with infected people or things they have touched. The California
Hotel said the numbers are inflated and it's not good for business.
Rob Stillwell, a hotel spokesman, conceded the hotel may not be
knowledgeable about all of the cases, especially if sick people
called the health department after leaving Las Vegas. The California
Hotel has stepped up cleaning at its properties, even going so far as
to clean public bathrooms every hour.
As regards the impact of the norovirus outbreak on the hotel's
business, the California said some people have canceled reservations,
but it's minimal. A spokesman said he couldn't give any numbers. but
a travel agent told KITV, a Honolulu television station, that with
spring break around the corner, the California is usually booked
solid. Right now, there are still many openings, according to the
agent. Nonetheless the number of complaints had declined last week,
KITV reported. But the Clark County Health Department in Nevada said
it cannot and will not give a clean bill of health until it has
observed a sustained decline for a period of at least one month.
