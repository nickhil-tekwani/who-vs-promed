The Departmental Health Services (SEDES) confirmed the death of a 15-year-old girl as well as 4 confirmed cases and 4 suspected cases from [infection by a] lethal hantavirus in the municipalities of Villa Tunari, Eterazama, Isinuta, and Villa since 14 Sep [2012] in Cochabamba department.

The death of the young girl put Cochabamba SEDES on alert, and a health emergency was declared in the whole Chapare jurisdiction, which is prone to occurrence of this disease. Concerning this situation, the Chief of Epidemiology of SEDES, Arturo Quinones, stated that the girl died this past weekend [20-21 Apr 2013] with an infectious clinical picture, and after laboratory tests were done, [it was confirmed that a] hantavirus [infection] was responsible [for her death]. He said that the disease [virus] is transmitted by infected rodents.

[This may be a duplicate report of the death of an adolescent girl in the tropical area of Cochabamba department that was posted on 15 Apr 2013 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130417.1651399). However, that report indicated that the girl was 17 years old, whereas this one indicates the death of a 15-year-old girl. In any case, the total case count is higher in the above report than in previous ones this year (2013).

The specific hantavirus involved in this or previous cases this year (2013) in Bolivia, or those in 2012, are not given.

In the lowland Amazon basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases is Laguna Negra virus and its rodent hosts, _Calomys laucha_ (http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg), the small vesper mouse and _C. callosus_ (https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg), the large vesper mouse. Other hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) that have been found in lowland Bolivia and can cause HPS include:
- Bermejo virus (_Oligoryzomys chacoensis_)

- Oran virus (_O. longicaudatus_) http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1203.jpeg.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health reports a Texas County [Oklahoma] man has died due to hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS].

The department says the death is the 1st due to [a] hantavirus [infection in the state] since 2001 and is the 3rd confirmed hantavirus death [in Oklahoma] since it was 1st recognized in the USA in 1993.

Hantaviruses are carried by wild rodents, particularly by deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] in Oklahoma. The health department says the hantavirus is transmitted to humans when they breathe in air that is contaminated by particles from rodent droppings, urine or saliva. Early symptoms of hantavirus [infections] can include fever and muscle aches, chills, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and coughing.

The department warns residents to be particularly careful during spring cleaning of barns, vacant cabins and outbuildings [by damping down dust before sweeping, wearing a face mask and disposable gloves. - Mod.JW].

[It is curious that in the above report, the state Health Department indicated that this fatal case of HPS is the 1st in the state this year [2013]. A 27 Mar 2013 report (ProMED-mail archive no. 20130329.1609076) stated that a previous fatal case in a 50-year-old woman was the 1st of the year.

This report indicates that the hantavirus responsible is most likely Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_ [deer mouse], which is widely distributed in North America and frequently invades houses, especially during cold, winter weather. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America. It will be of interest to know the outcome of any laboratory tests done. The case fatality rate for Sin Nombre virus is 38-40 per cent, with a higher risk of death in those patients who seek medical attention late in the course of their disease.
