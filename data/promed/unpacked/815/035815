Twelve Royal Bengal tigers died in an Indian zoo after eating contaminated
meat, a laboratory official said Sunday.
Originally, authorities at the Nandankanan Zoo in Bhubaneshwar, the capital
of Orissa state, said the tigers died last week of sleeping sickness, a
disease carried by tsetse flies. But tests by Calcutta's Pathological
Laboratory, run by the federal government, established the deaths were
caused by the consumption of decomposed and contaminated cow meat, an
official at the laboratory said on condition of anonymity. The official
helped carry out the tests. There was no immediate comment from zoo
officials.
On Monday, India's Supreme Court ordered a federal investigation into the
tigers' deaths. The Nandankanan zoo had conducted necropsies and cremated
the tigers before federal investigators arrived, saying it acted to keep
the skins from reaching the black market.
The zoo is home to India's largest collection of tigers. It had 56 of the
rare cats. Now it has 44. Eight of the dead animals were white tigers.

Tests by a government-run pathological laboratory here have established the
deaths of the 12 Royal Bengal tigers at the Nandankanan Zoo were caused by
"consumption of decomposed and contaminated meat of dead cattle" and not
sleeping sickness as claimed by the zoo authorities, an official at the
laboratory said on condition of anonymity. The official was a member of the
team carrying out the tests.
There was no immediate comment by the Nandankanan Zoo authorities in
Bhubaneshwar, which claimed the tigers had died of sleeping sickness, a
disease carried by tsetse flies.
A Chowdhury, an expert, dismissed the possibility of the disease being
transmitted to the tigers by the fly bite. "The infection in the
Nandankanan zoo was certainly spread through contaminated cattle meat
consumed by the tigers, who more often than not, have abrasions in their
mouth caused by sharp bones while eating the meat," said Chowdhury, former
head of the Zoology department of Calcutta University. He said the
infection entered into the blood stream of the tigers through these cuts
while they ate the infected meat.

[Earlier postings on ProMED-mail reported on the zoo trading tigers for
other species, possibly African species. Furthermore, trypanosomes could
potentially be acquired through consumption of trypanosome infected meat.
The zoo has only said the tigers died from decomposed meat. This meat may
well have been trypanosome infected meat. It would seem a necropsy with
blood smears would identify the trypanosome.
However, decomposed meat may contain bacteria and/or preformed endotoxins
as well as opportunistic pathogens and potentially trypanosomes. However,
the clinical signs of jaundice does not fit well with the indication of
decomposed meat. Tigers are quite capable of vomiting and it seems with
decomposed meat there would have been clinical signs of vomiting and
diarrhea.
Furthermore, this does not add up, as the zoo first announced they were
having difficulty feeding the tigers. Was this an effort to avoid admitting
they fed potentially trypanosome-infected meat or decomposing meat?
Could someone associated with necropsy could let us know what is really
happening. The clinical signs and previous releases from the zoo do not add
up. - Mod.TG

Tests at the Tamil Nadu Veterinary Sciences University have "confirmed"
flies carrying the dreaded Tryponsome parasite, and not infected meat, were
the cause for the deaths of 12 tigers in Nandankanan.
The live flies were caught in the Nandankanan zoo. The killer tryponsomes
parasite was found in the tigers' guts.
Doctors at the University, however, said it was not possible to trace the
source of infection by examining the blood and other tissue samples of the
dead tigers. "By and large flies have been the culprit and infected meat is
only a remote possibility," said Dr. M. Manohar.
