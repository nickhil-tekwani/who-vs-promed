Dozens sickened at Kansas City conference
----------------------
KANSAS CITY, Missouri (CNN) -- Health officials are trying to find the
source of an outbreak of a suspected food-borne illness that sickened at
least 50 people attending a convention in Kansas City this week.
All of those who reported coming down with a gastro-intestinal illness were
participants in an anti-smoking conference held at a Marriott hotel
downtown. No one was hospitalized, but at least one person did go to a
local hospital for treatment.
The cause of the outbreak hasn't been determined, but Sheryl Woods, a
spokeswoman for the Kansas City Health Department, said the symptoms were
compatible with a food-borne illness.
None of the other hotel guests were sickened, said hotel general manager
Carol Pecoraro. She said the hotel is cooperating with the health
department's investigation, and noted that some events related to the
conference were held outside the hotel.
"We're as anxious as they are to determine the cause of this," she said.
About 300 people from 48 states and several other countries attended the
conference, and most left Kansas City after the convention ended Friday,
Woods said.
Investigators plan interview all of the attendees to find out where they
went and what they ate, she said.

[In the absence of information on the clinical presentation of the cases,
or information on the incubation period it is hazardous to attempt to
define the etiology of this outbreak. An article in the Kansas City
Star (<http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/3657414.htm> mentioned
that the health department would have to suspend the investigation until
Monday, as most participants registered giving their work contact
information and hence they were unable to contact participants for the
investigation. More information on this outbreak from official sources
would be appreciated when available. - Mod.MPP]
