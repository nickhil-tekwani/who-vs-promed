The confirmation of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in
domestic birds in northern Nigeria marks the further geographic
spread of this virus. Although all evidence to date indicates that
the virus does not spread easily from birds to humans, careful
monitoring of the situation is warranted. Experience in several other
countries has shown how quickly the H5N1 virus can spread and become
firmly established in poultry. The ability of this virus to cause
rare but severe disease in humans is well documented.

At present, the only confirmed H5N1 outbreak is thought to be
confined to a large commercial farm located in Kaduna State in the
northern part of the country, where thousands of chickens were kept
in battery cages. Investigations are urgently needed to determine
whether the outbreak, which began almost a month ago, has spread from
the farm to affect household flocks. Poultry deaths in the adjacent
province of Kano have been reported, but the cause has not yet been
determined.

The most immediate public health need is to reduce opportunities for
human infections. Investigations of human cases in Asia and elsewhere
have identified close contact with diseased or dead household poultry
as the most important source of human exposure to the virus.

In Nigeria, as in other parts of Africa, most village households
maintain free-ranging flocks of poultry as a source of income and
food. Close human contact with poultry is extensive. If the virus has
spread to household flocks in Nigeria, public information campaigns
will be needed to warn populations to avoid high-risk behaviors,
including the slaughtering, de-feathering, butchering, and
preparation for consumption of diseased poultry.

WHO is ready to respond to requests from Nigeria for support,
including assessment teams and the provision of essential supplies
and equipment. Infectious disease staff at WHO's regional office in
Harare, Zimbabwe held an emergency meeting today [8 Feb 2006] to
assess the situation, plan a response, and evaluate the possible risk
to other African countries. A team of experts experienced in the
investigation of outbreaks has been placed on standby.

No clear information about the source of the Nigerian outbreak is
presently available, but the country is known to lie along a flight
route for birds migrating from central Asia.

Full sequence information about the virus in the Nigerian outbreak is
expected later this week [2nd week February 2005]. This information
will allow comparison with viruses that have caused human cases
elsewhere and thus assist in the assessment of risks to human health.
Sequence information may also shed some light on the origins of the
outbreak.

2 Indonesian women from an area just east of the capital are in
hospital after local tests showed they had [contracted] H5N1 bird flu
virus, a senior Health Ministry official said on Thu [9 Feb 2006].
Hariadi Wibisono, Director of Control of Animal-borne Diseases at the
Ministry, said the two women -- one aged 27 and the other 22 -- were
being treated at a Jakarta hospital designated for bird flu patients.
"We received the results last night. Their health condition now is
worsening," Wibisono said. Further blood samples had been sent to a
Hong Kong laboratory recognised by the World Health Organisation for
confirmation.

Indonesia has had 16 WHO-confirmed deaths from bird flu and seven
confirmed cases where patients have survived. The two women are not
related, but hail from the same suburban Jakarta area of Bekasi.
Sulianti Saroso hospital spokesman Ilham Patu said it was not clear
how they may have picked up the virus. At least one had no direct
contact with chickens, he said. Most Indonesian cases have shown the
victims had contact with dead chickens.

Turkey, Iraq and Nigeria have in recent weeks become the latest
countries outside Asia to report human cases of the H5N1 strain of
avian flu. [This statement is incorrect: no confirmed or suspected
human cases of H5N1 virus infection have been reported from Nigeria;
as of 9 Feb 2006, only outbreaks of disease in poultry have been
reported: see Avian Influenza, human - worldwide: Nigeria, WHO update
- to be archived. - Mod.CP].

While it mostly affects birds, the virus has killed at least 88
people [and 77 have survived] in seven countries since 2003,
according to the World Health Organisation. Experts fear the H5N1
virus will mutate to become easily passed between humans, triggering
a pandemic. The highly pathogenic [H5N1 avian influenza virus] has
affected birds in two-thirds of the provinces in Indonesia, an
archipelago of about 17 000 islands and 220 million people. The
country has millions of chickens and ducks, many in the yards of
rural or urban homes, making it likely that more humans will become
infected with the virus.

[If these 2 suspected human cases of avian influenza are confirmed by
the WHO reference laboratory in the Hong Kong S.A.R., the number of
confirmed cases in Indonesia since 2003 will become 25 with 16
deaths. The first cases were not recorded until 2005. - Mod.CP]

China: Avian Influenza situation - WHO Update 3
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has reported the country's 11th
laboratory-confirmed case of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The case is a 26-year-old female farmer from the
southeastern province of Fujian. She developed symptoms on 10 Jan
2006 and was subsequently hospitalized with pneumonia. She remains
under treatment in stable condition. Like many of the other cases in
China, this one occurred in an area where no recent poultry outbreaks
have been officially reported.

Of China's 11 laboratory-confirmed cases, 7 have been fatal. The
cases have occurred in 7 provinces and regions: Anhui, Fujian,
Guangxi, Jiangxi, Hunan, Liaoning, and Sichuan.

The continuing occurrence of sporadic human cases indicates that the
virus is continuing to circulate in birds in at least some parts of
the country. Since May 2005, agricultural authorities have reported
32 poultry outbreaks across the country, the majority of which were
reported in October and November 2005.

3 poultry outbreaks have been reported so far in 2006: one in Sichuan
Province on 3 Jan, one in Guizhou Province on 10 Jan and one in
Shanxi Province on 8 Feb. The country's first 2 confirmed human cases
of H5N1 infection were reported in mid-November 2005.
