An anthrax outbreak has been confirmed on a cattle farm in southern
Alberta, according to an official with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA). The farm in question has been quarantined, and it is believed the
outbreak has been contained.
Larry Turner, acting regional director, south Alberta region, of the CFIA
was alerted last week of the possibility of anthrax by a local
veterinarian. The report was confirmed over the weekend. So far, 12 deaths
have resulted from anthrax in the herd. Turner described the outbreak as a
"controlled situation." It appears the disease has not spread to any other
properties.
Upon reporting of the outbreak, the farm was placed under immediate
quarantine. Movement around the farm was restricted and the remaining
animals in the herd have also been placed under a quarantine and moved
away. The herd has been vaccinated and will be observed to see if any signs
develop. The 12 carcasses were burned and buried to avoid the spread of the
disease.
Anthrax is a disease that attacks sheep, cattle, and horses. In Canada, the
incidence of anthrax varies with the soil type and climactic conditions. It
does occur sporadically, causing loss of livestock.
Anthrax is caused by anthrax bacteria (_Bacillus anthracis_), which grow
very rapidly with adequate nourishment and moderate temperatures. Even when
the environment is not favorable, the bacteria produce spores that can
survive for extremely long periods of time in the soil.
The bacteria or spores enter the body by ingestion, inhalation, or a break
in the skin. Most infections are thought to occur when the animals
encounter infected pasture conditions. Anthrax is not highly contagious and
most animals exposed to the disease do not succumb to it.
