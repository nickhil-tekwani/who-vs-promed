Many people in the health field as well as the field of avian ecology are
becoming increasingly disturbed by the disregard for sound science in the
rush to draw conclusions about the current H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks.

This has been going on for some time and is perpetuated in current reports.
For example: In the ProMED-mail posting of 22 Jun 2005 (Avian influenza,
wild waterfowl - China (04): (Xingiang) 20050622.1743), mortalities of
"ducks and geese" are mentioned without specifying if they were domestic
ducks and domestic geese, or free-ranging wild species of ducks and geese.

In the posting: Avian influenza, geese - China (04) 20050620.1735, species
specificity was clearly (and usefully) provided in the FAO report: "The 519
wild bird deaths, including Bar-headed Geese, Great Black-headed Gulls,
Brown-headed Gulls, Ruddy Shelducks, and Great Cormorants, at the Qinghai
Lake Nature Reserve in Gangcha County, Qinghai Province were confirmed by
the National AI Reference Laboratory (Harbin) to be due to H5N1 avian
influenza (AI) strain infection."

Most of these species do not migrate to Southeast China or to Southeast
Asia. Some, such as the bar-headed geese, fly southwest for the winter to
India and Bangladesh. There have been no reports of H5N1 outbreaks in India
or Bangladesh occurring this past winter, reasonably suggesting that
migratory birds neither carried H5N1 with them from China last fall, nor
returned with it this spring. If there was a high mortality in Quinghai, it
would suggest that H5N1 is also highly pathogenic to the wild species
affected, rather than making them likely sub-clinical carriers -- as
domestic ducks are. The percentage mortality of the various wild species
has not been reported, nor has the percentage of dead birds that tested
positive for H5N1. More likely than migratory birds bringing the virus from
India or Bangladesh, uninfected wild birds arriving on summer breeding
grounds in China could have easily been infected by local domestic ducks
(or domestic chickens or geese) close to the end of the migration route.

There is also precedence for long distance travel of avian influenza due to
domestic poultry: reports suggested that the introduction of H5N1 to Lhasa
in January 2004 followed the movement of poultry from Lanzhou, Gansu
province, China; a distance of approximately 1500 km (FAO 2004).

Recent laboratory confirmation matching the H5N1 with the virus present
during previous years in China, along with a large mortality event in a
number of wild species suggests recent infection upon entering China as a
hypothesis equally sound as that of migratory birds bringing the virus with
them.

Since dead birds do not migrate well, the likelihood of migratory birds
spreading the disease is reduced to the few (if any) carriers that survived
the outbreak. This is also unknown. Studies need to be conducted before
statements are made that any specific species of wild bird in current
outbreak areas is capable of carrier status.

There is also the unfortunate tendency to draw a large circle around 10
percent of the Earth's surface that includes Asia and the western Pacific
and call it "the" migratory route. This generalization does not represent
the reality of species-specific timings of migration nor the geographic
specificity of routes, many of which have been poorly studied.

Many scientists are concerned with the potential misuse of non-peer
reviewed information, but we need to be equally aware of the risks of
peer-reviewed publications and releases not being reviewed by "non-peer"
experts from other disciplines. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that
much of the public is informed by simplified versions of findings or
announcements provided by media reports.

Misinterpretations and inaccurate generalities can be perpetuated in the
literature and textbooks for decades, resulting in commonly accepted ideas
being based on an originally false conclusion. Statements implying that
migratory birds are spreading H5N1 in Asia with little sound scientific
basis contributes little to the solution. We are not so naive to say that
the possibility that either migratory or wild resident birds are not now a
source of H5N1 after originally being infected by domestic birds, but
currently the evidence does not indicate whether migratory wild birds are
the victims or the vectors (loosely-used), or both.

Good science has never demonstrated that the culling of wild birds is an
effective avian influenza control measure, not to mention that this can be
a violation of a number of international treaties and conventions. The most
effective way to prevent transmission of HPAI between domestic poultry and
wild birds is to improve biosecurity around poultry farms. The key goal of
improved biosecurity would be to reduce or prevent contact between wild
birds and domestic poultry and their wastes, whether in backyard flocks or
larger poultry-producing facilities. Better surveillance of not only
commercial but also rural poultry flocks is equally important. Vaccination
of domestic poultry is another effective method to control avian influenza.

All of this is supported by the FAO because they base their recommendations
on sound science and sensible solutions.

Waterfowl in Vietnam's central province infected with bird flu
--------------------------------------------------------------
1/5 of total waterfowl flocks in Vietnam's central Quang Tri province have
just been found to contract bird flu virus strain H5N1, local newspaper
Saigon Liberation reported on Friday [24 Jun 2005].

The provincial Veterinarian Bureau has culled over 23 000 waterfowl, mainly
ducks, in the 38 infected flocks. It will further the culling if the 144
untested flocks prove to be infected with H5N1.

Vietnam, which has seen no bird flu outbreaks since April 2005, culled a
flock of 6700 chickens in southern Ben Tre province in mid-June after
specimens from 6000 dead or sick poultry in the flock tested positive to H5N1.

An international team, consisting of top virologists and epidemiologists
from Chinese Hong Kong, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States,
arrived in Vietnam on 6 Jun 2005 to study the possibility of more
widespread H5N1 human transmission, changes in the virus strain, and the
likelihood of increased person-to-person transmission, said a press release
by the office of the World Health Organization (WHO) Representative in
Vietnam on Friday.

"What has happened in Vietnam may have public health implications for the
entire world, and will be crucial in preparing for a possible pandemic,"
Hans Troedsson, WHO Representative in the country, was quoted in the release.

In mid-June, the Preventive Medicine Department under Vietnam's Health
Ministry announced that 4 local people were infected with H5N1 from 1-17
June, including 2 from Hanoi capital city, 1 from northern Hai Duong
province, and 1 from central Nghe An province.

The newly confirmed cases bring the total in Vietnam since mid- December
2004 to 59 cases, of which 18 were fatal. Since the 1st bird flu patient
was detected in Vietnam in late 2003, Vietnam had detected 86 human cases
of bird flu infection, including 38 fatalities, in 31 cities and provinces,
the department confirmed late last week.
