While the town of Forézienne welcomes the international competition of ultimate Frisbee, which will be ongoing until 4 Aug 2018, this 1st day has turned into a nightmare. In all, 34 participants from foreign delegations (20 Israelis, 4 Colombians and 10 Belgians) were victims of food poisoning. Many of them will have to be hospitalized, but there are no further details for the moment.

First Aid was given on site at the municipal gymnasium near the Maurice-Rousson Stadium. Gérard Lacroix, secretary general of the prefecture of the Loire, said that "the medical teams of Sdis and Samu were immediately engaged, as well as the gendarmerie and the DDPP (Departmental Directorate of protection of the population)." The latter will visit the caterer who provided the meals, who is based in Saint-Chamond, this Mon 30 Jul 2018.

A Samu helicopter also went to the scene but left without taking any food poisoning patient on board.

[The etiology of the presumed foodborne illnesses here is not stated. Useful information regarding the cluster would be the incubation period from ingestion of the presumed vehicle and the beginning of illness, the symptoms (gastrointestinal or otherwise), and the presence or absence of fever. Since it seemed to occur on the 1st day of competition, the etiology may well be the short incubation period staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced illness, which presents with a short incubation period, often under 6 hours, with vomiting and little or no fever.

Ultimate, originally known as Ultimate Frisbee (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)), is a non-contact team sport played with a flying disc (frisbee). Ultimate was developed in 1968 by a group of students at Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey. Although Ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. The term frisbee, often used to generically describe all flying discs, is a registered trademark of the Wham-O toy company, and thus the sport is not formally called "Ultimate frisbee," though this name is still in common casual use. Points are scored by passing the disc to a teammate in the opposing end zone. Other basic rules are that players must not take steps while holding the disc, and interceptions, incomplete passes, and passes out of bounds are turnovers. Rain, wind, or occasionally other adversities can make for a testing match with rapid turnovers, heightening the pressure of play.

From its beginnings in the American counterculture of the late 1960s, ultimate has resisted empowering any referee with rule enforcement, instead relying on the sportsmanship of players and invoking "Spirit of the Game" to maintain fair play. Players call their own fouls and dispute a foul only when they genuinely believe it did not occur. Playing without referees is the norm for league play but has been supplanted in club competition by the use of "observers" or "game advisors" to help in disputes, and the professional league employs empowered referees. The sport is recognized by the International Olympic Committee and is eligible for the 2024 Olympics. - Mod.LL
