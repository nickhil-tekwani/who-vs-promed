Veterinarians are warning pet owners to keep their pups out of the dog park this month [April 2015], as a flu epidemic is sickening dogs all over the US Midwest.

WXYZ Detroit, Michigan, reports that there have been 13 000 known cases across 4 states: Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio, and Indiana. The virus is now being identified as the H3N2 strain.

There is a regular seasonal flu vaccine already available for pooches, but doctors aren't sure how effective it will be against this particular strain. The illness is a new threat for the dog population of the United States, and believed to have come from Asia.

Much like the flu, which affects humans, symptoms of the canine influenza include a persistent cough, runny nose, and fever. And, like the flu we love to hate, some of those infected face worse symptoms than others. According to reports, 6 cases have been fatal.

Experts say the virus is no threat to humans, but that petting an infected dog will leave the germs on your hands and clothes, which can then be spread to other dogs. It is also suspected that this strain of the flu could potentially affect cats. As of now, experts suggest keeping your dog isolated until the outbreak subsides.

[The new strain of canine influenza, H3N2, was confirmed some days ago with a link to Asia, a strain that may have come from Korea. People in the US have been bringing dogs from factory farms for meat production in Korea where they are brutally treated, with the goal of saving them. It is possible that a dog infected with a Korean version of the canine influenza came over to the US. It is understandable that a new strain having been transported in from somewhere means our native animals have no immunity. - Mod.TG
