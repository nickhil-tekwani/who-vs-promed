Swept by a storm a week ago, southeast Madagascar is at the same time
hit by a chikungunya [virus infection] epidemic. At least 2000 cases
were recorded in Mananjary.

Double trouble for Malagasies. After the storm "Hubert" that has
battered part of the Big Island (54 dead, 97 589 victims, and 38 188
homeless), the disease is just now the challenge. And the events
unfold exactly the same area, southeast, in the region
Vatovavy-Fitovinany, located in the province of Fianarantsoa. "We had
an epidemic signal the end of last week [week of 8 Mar 2010]," said
Dr Jean-Louis Solet, a physician epidemiologist at the interregional
cell for epidemiology (CIRE), Reunion-Mayotte.

There is an epidemic of chikungunya [virus infection] in the town of
Mananjary, with over 2000 suspected cases identified. "The laboratory
of the Pasteur Institute, based in Antananarivo has laboratory
confirmed 100 [chikungunya] cases. Yet in the Malagasy press, it is
reported that there are "37 cases". The daily newspaper "L'Express de
Madagascar" describes the situation there: "This disease has a
peculiar character. It causes a sort of paralysis of the lower limbs,
paralysis that also affects the hip. Which is why local people have
called it "Kilalaka 2010", referring to the "dahalo" dance which is
very popular at the moment."

Madagascan health officials have pressed ahead on Friday [12 Mar
2010] to see the extent of the epidemic. Furthermore, anti-mosquito
actions have been conducted with support from the Malagasy Red Cross
(MRC). "They have strengthened disease surveillance for the entire
territory," said Dr Solet. It must be said that other outbreaks of
chikungunya [disease] have been reported across the country. The
chikungunya epidemic that struck the Indian Ocean between 2005 and
2006 "had not affected all regions of Madagascar, said Jean-Louis
Solet. This can lead to small localized epidemics in [previously]
unaffected populations. "In the region affected by this new epidemic
wave, the "Hubert" storm has killed 42 people. And the natural
disaster could lead to a health disaster: "At first, the storm killed
many mosquitoes. But afterward, this will create many breeding
sites," fears the epidemiologist. And an outbreak of chikungunya,
which extends to Madagascar, can only worry Reunion [as well].

report was kindly provided by Dr Jean-Michel Heraud, Head of Virology
Unit (NRL) Institut Pasteur from Madagascar. ProMED-mail would

growing outbreak becomes available.
