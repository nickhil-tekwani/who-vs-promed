West Nile Virus Alert
---------------------
Background: In 2002, West Nile virus (WNV) is expected to return to
Pennsylvania and other states where it has been found since 1999, and to
continue moving westward across the United States. The virus has already been
identified in Florida and Louisiana this year. Since the virus was first
identified in New York in 1999, it has spread as far west as Iowa, and south
to southern Florida.
In 2001, there were 2 separate foci of infection in the U.S.; the
Northeastern U.S., including Pennsylvania, and the Southeastern U.S., with
Florida having the majority of the equine cases. In 2001 66 human cases were
reported, with 9 deaths. More than 700 equine cases were reported, with at
least 156 deaths; the total number of fatalities is probably much higher, but
many of the equine case outcomes were not reported. In Pennsylvania, 7
affected horses were reported, and 4 were euthanized due to the severity of
clinical symptoms. All 7 cases were stabled in the southeastern part of the
state.
Transmission: WNV is transmitted by mosquitoes that have taken a blood meal
from a bird that is infected with the virus. The mosquitoes may transmit the
virus to horses, other animals, and people when they take another blood meal.
Prevention and Control: Control of mosquito populations through elimination
of mosquito breeding sites is necessary to reduce the risk of infection.
Mosquitoes breed in areas with stagnant water, so all containers or natural
sources of stagnant water should be cleaned frequently or drained. Additional
methods of reducing risk of horses becoming infected include the use of
screens, insect repellants, and fans. Results from a USDA case study done
late in 2000 indicated that horses stabled outdoors at night might be at a
slightly higher risk of becoming infected with WNV.
Equine Vaccine
--------------
An equine vaccine for the protection of healthy horses against disease from
WNV is available from Fort Dodge through veterinarians. The vaccine was
granted a conditional license in 2001 from the USDA. A conditional license is
granted when there is an immediate need for a product, and that product has
been shown to be safe and pure, with a reasonable expectation of efficacy.
Preliminary efficacy studies reportedly suggest that the vaccine is effective
in preventing disease in healthy horses, and neutralizing antibodies (IgG)
have been identified in vaccinated horses at approximately 14 days following
the second vaccine dose (it may take longer before antibodies can be
detected).
It is impossible to identify naturally infected horses from vaccinated horses
with current laboratory tests. It has been shown that only one dose of
vaccine is not likely to protect a horse from infection; horses that are
bitten by an infected mosquito before the horse has received the second dose
of vaccine may become infected and ill. This suggests that it is vital to
adhere to the recommended protocol of 2 (1 ml) intramuscular (IM) doses 3 to
6 weeks apart. The second dose should be given at least 3 weeks before
mosquito activity is expected in your area, if possible. An annual booster is
recommended.
