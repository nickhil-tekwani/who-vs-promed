SARS multi-country outbreak - update 6
--------------------------------------
Major step towards development of diagnostic test:
A laboratory in a new network set up on Mon 17 Mar 2003 has today succeeded
in growing, in cell culture, an infectious agent that might be the cause of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). This major step towards the
development of a diagnostic test has occurred despite the failure, up to
now, to pinpoint the exact identity of the causative agent.
Researchers at the laboratory took serum samples from the blood of
recovering SARS patients and a matching number of healthy volunteers in
what is known as a "blinded" test. Serum from patients infected by a virus
usually contains neutralizing antibodies that stop the growth of the virus
-- whatever its identity -- when added to a cell culture in which the virus
has been successfully grown. When the researchers added serum from SARS
patients to the cell culture, virus growth was halted. Serum from
uninfected healthy controls had no effect on the virus.
"This is not just some light at the end of the tunnel," said WHO virologist
Dr Klaus St√∂hr, who is coordinating the collaborative laboratory efforts.
"This is a real ray of sunshine."
WHO cautions, however, that the number of patients in the test was small
and more work needs to be done. The scientific community is excited by the
news, which could be regarded as the first important step towards the
development of a diagnostic test.
The infectious agent resembles the morphology of a Paramyxovirus.
Scientists cannot, however, be certain about the identity of the virus,
which may indeed be a new Paramyxovirus or another virus with a similar
morphology.
The laboratory is one of 11 leading labs participating in an international
multicentre research project. The project was set up by WHO on Monday to
expedite identification of the causative agent -- considered by several
research groups to be a member of the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses --
and rapidly develop a diagnostic test.
WHO team of experts travelling to China:
A WHO team of 5 infectious disease experts will be travelling over the
weekend to China to support investigations there of an outbreak of atypical
pneumonia that began in Guangdong Province in mid-November. The
multinational team was assembled in response to a request from the Chinese
Ministry of Health for epidemiological and laboratory support to aid
ongoing investigation of the outbreak. The team will also assist in
laboratory work that might lead to identification of the causative agent.
The team includes experts in virology, laboratory techniques,
epidemiological investigation, and the control of unusual infectious
diseases. Team members, of American, Australian, British, and German
nationality, have been drawn from institutes participating in the WHO
Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.
The outbreak in southern China is linked geographically and by timing to
the current outbreak of SARS, which first surfaced in Asia in mid-February
and caused its first known death on 13 Mar 2003. Cases of this new disease
have now been detected in 13 countries on three continents. Hong Kong SAR
China, which as of today accounts for 203 of the 350 suspected or probable
cases reported worldwide, remains the most severely affected area.
Apart from searching for the causative agent, the WHO team is expected to
help Chinese scientists determine whether the Guangdong outbreak included
cases that fit the current definition of SARS.
Conclusive identification of the causative agent, which is thought to be a
virus of the Paramyxoviridae family, would greatly aid the investigation by
Chinese scientists and the WHO team, which is expected to begin on Monday.
Research on the identity of the SARS pathogen is progressing rapidly within
a network of 11 leading laboratories set up by WHO earlier this week. WHO
remains optimistic that a definitive announcement of the cause of SARS can
be made soon.
History of the Guangdong outbreak:
WHO was first officially informed of the outbreak on 11 Feb 2003, when the
Chinese Ministry of Health reported that 305 cases of acute respiratory
syndrome of unknown cause had occurred in six municipalities in Guangdong
Province in southern China. [see ProMED-mail 10 Feb 2003: Pneumonia - China
(Guangdong): RFI 20030210.0357 - Mod.MPP] 5 deaths were reported.
Transmission of the disease was largely confined to health care workers
(105 doctors, nurses, and other medical workers) and household contacts of
patients.
On 14 Feb 2003, WHO was informed by the Chinese Ministry of Health that the
outbreak was clinically consistent with atypical pneumonia. Reported
symptoms included fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing.
Patients had acute symptoms, included high fever, dry cough, muscle pain,
and weakness, and required hospitalization. The Chinese authorities also
provided information that cases had been detected in the province as far
back as 16 Nov 2002.
In mid-February 2003, some Chinese experts concluded that the outbreak was
caused by chlamydial organisms. Others speculated that a virus might be the
cause. It is hoped that the WHO team can help authorities quickly resolve
these and other outstanding questions about the Guangdong outbreak.
Update on cases and affected countries As of 21 March, 350 suspected and
probable cases, including 10 deaths, have been reported from 13 countries.
These figures represent an additional 44 cases and two new countries
compared with the previous day. The number of deaths remains unchanged.
Countries reported their first suspected cases are Italy and the Republic
of Ireland, each reporting one case. New cases were reported in Hong Kong
(30), Singapore (5), Taiwan, China (2), Thailand (3), and the United States
of America (2).
New guidelines for health authorities WHO has today posted on its web site
2 documents to assist national authorities in the investigation and
management of cases. The first gives a more complete, though still
preliminary, clinical picture of SARS, pooled from findings provided by
clinicians treating SARS patients in seven countries. It is anticipated
that the clinical description will help health authorities recognize cases
with greater precision.
The second document provides advice, including recommended laboratory tests
and radiological findings, that can guide the safe discharge and follow-up
of convalescent cases. The policy advice aims to ensure that the release of
recovered patients carries no risks for family members and other close
contacts. Until more is known about the etiological agent, and the
potential for continued carriage, WHO is recommending a cautious approach.

[The above notice is very promising towards having identified the etiologic
agent for SARS. As is mentioned in this report, serum from cases of SARS
has inhibited the growth of the suspected etiologic agent, an as yet
unidentified member of the paramyxovirus family, suggesting that patients
with SARS have developed protective antibodies against this agent, whereas
healthy controls do not have these protective antibodies. Again caution is
advised as these tests have been conducted on a small number of the cases
and controls, and larger studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.
As an addendum to the history of the outbreak in Guangdong, ProMED-mail
received a report of an outbreak of pneumonia in Guangdong on 10 Feb 2003
from Stephen O Cunnion, MD, PhD, MPH <cunnion@erols.com> stating "An
acquaintance of mine from a teacher's chat room lives there (Guangdong)
and reports that the hospitals there have been closed and people are
dying." On the same date our Chinese website manager Jack Soo
<kyip@gmx.net> found a newswire report in the Chinese language press in
Hong Kong which stated "Commenting on the problem of pneumonia on the
Mainland, Dr Yeoh said the Department of Health has already touched base
with the Guangdong authorities to learn more about the type of infection
prevalent there. The department will also determine whether there is any
particular risk of that infection coming to Hong Kong." This further
highlights the power of the internet in facilitating the rapid transmission
of information, in this case on disease occurrence. - Mod.MPP]
