Soil fungi linked to insect-associated decline of resistant grape rootstocks
------------------------------------------------
Destructive phylloxera insects have been reported feeding on grape
rootstocks in several declining Northern California vineyards. The cause of
the damage appears to be fungal activity rather than the loss of rootstock
resistance, researchers report at the University of California, Davis.
They suspect that disease-causing fungi, spread by phylloxera, are
responsible for the weakened vines at some previously infected vineyard
sites. Research results suggest these fungi are spread by phylloxera as
they taste and probe among feeder roots and older storage roots of the
grapevines, leaving the roots more vulnerable to fungal decay. Scientists
are conducting studies at several field sites in Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino
counties
"There is no reason to question the utility of either the 101-14 Mgt.
rootstock or the Teleki 5C rootstock," stressed Jim Wolpert, chair of UC
Davis' viticulture and enology department. "Nor is there any indication
that any other phylloxera rootstock with pure American species parentage is
failing." However, researchers noted that phylloxera populations were
higher than normal on the immature roots of the strongly resistant
rootstocks, and that such populations are not normally associated with vine
damage.
Phylloxera are aphid-like insects that feed on grapevine roots, eventually
killing the vines. During the later part of the 1800s, phylloxera destroyed
2/3rds of Europe's vineyards. The pest arrived in California about the same
time, either from its native range in the eastern United States or from Europe.
California viticulture adopted the European solution to the problem, using
rootstocks developed from resistant American species. These rootstocks
performed well when poorly resistant rootstock AXR#1 were planted at the
end of the 20th century.
For the past year [2004], UC Davis professors Jeff Granett and Andy Walker,
with expertise respectively in entomology and grape rootstocks and
breeding, have been investigating several sites where phylloxera-associated
damage was reported.
Several of the vineyards studied had been planted on rootstocks that are
not resistant to phylloxera. At other study sites where vines were damaged,
phylloxera were rarely found.
Phylloxera were present at 4 sites where declining grapevines were planted
on the phylloxera-resistant rootstocks 101-14 Mgt. and Teleki 5C. The
researchers observed that shoot growth was reduced on these vines, and
phylloxera populations were unusually high on young feeder roots. However,
phylloxera were not found feeding on the vines' mature roots, suggesting
that those rootstocks were still resistant to the pest.
The researchers found plant-feeding nematodes at the research sites, but
their numbers were the same among both strong and weakened vines. These
fungi also were found among the vineyards studied, appearing much more
virulent in the soils of the damaged vines.
Deep roots, left over from vineyards where phylloxera-susceptible vines
were removed many years ago, can continue to provide a food source for
phylloxera and the fungal strains, as well as for nematodes associated with
root decline.
This would explain the phylloxera-associated decline observed in vineyards
that had been previously planted with the rootstock AXR#1, known for its
poor resistance to phylloxera. AXR#1 was widely removed in the 1990s from
California vineyards due to phylloxera and associated fungal activity.
Granett and Walker suspect that phylloxera populations are elevated
somewhat by the effect of irrigation on the initiation of susceptible
feeder roots, and that dead AXR#1 roots, now buried deep in the replanted
vineyards, have helped to maintain virulent fungal strains that have
subsequently been transferred to mature storage roots by phylloxera
probing. They note, however, that an alternative scenario could be that the
virulence of the phylloxera has changed.
Research is being planned for 2006 to explore these 2 possibilities. Since
phylloxera appear to partially adapt at infesting immature feeder roots of
most rootstocks now in commercial use, the results do not suggest that any
of the strongly resistant rootstocks are better or worse than the others
under these circumstances. In addition, they note that many acres of
vineyards have been replanted with 5C and 101-14 rootstocks, and symptoms
of decline in these replanted vineyards are rare.
Granett and Walker stress that phylloxera have been observed for many years
feeding on root tips of resistant vines, but reports linking root-tip
feeding to decline of the grape vines are rare. They urge vineyard managers
to be vigilant and notify them of any unusual phylloxera activity.
"The university takes seriously all reports of phylloxera and declining
vines and is in the process of evaluating these sites to determine what is
happening," Wolpert said. "There is no evidence of phylloxera-related
decline on the vast majority of the replanted vineyards."

[Grape phylloxera, _Daktulosphaira vitifoliae_ [Dv] (_Homoptera:
Phylloxeridae_), is a worldwide pest of grapevines. Its life cycle has
sexual and asexual portions with forms that feed from leaf and root galls.
Not all forms occur throughout the insect's range. Root forms predominate
on _Vitis vinifera_ cultivars; leaf forms predominate on other _Vitis_
spp.characteristic of the American native range. Other conditions influence
expression of the life cycle. Hosts and conditions similarly affect life
table performance. Damage to grapevines is by secondary soilborne pathogens
attacking feeding sites and by physiological interaction of Dv with the
grapevine, though the latter has not been well studied. Resistant
rootstocks derived from native American _Vitis_ are the primary control
tool. Dv varies genetically and relative to performance on hosts. Use of
insecticides is limited in effect, and other control methods are not
proven. More research on the biology, ecology, and management of Dv is needed.
What is interesting in this piece is the involvement of Dv in spreading the
soilborne fungus, _Fusarium oxysporum_, in vineyards where it overpowers
resistant cultivars. Granett stated that strains of _Fusarium oxysporum_
were involved in this vineyard decline. Interestingly, Fo strains isolated
from declining areas in vineyards are far more aggressive than isolates
from non-impacted vineyards or soils when tested by root assays in the lab,
greenhouse and field. Soil compaction (increase in penetration resistance)
is the natural result of multiple passes of heavy equipment down vineyard
rows. The use of farm equipment with narrow tires exacerbates the problem
as the weight of the vehicle is spread over a very small area. Using wider
set of tires on heavy vehicles can, in part, alleviate this problem
