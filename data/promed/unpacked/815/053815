After a rash of skunk sightings last weekend [4-5 Apr 2015], authorities are warning of a distemper outbreak.

Over the weekend several sick skunks were reported to Duluth police; 2 were euthanized. Authorities with the Humane Society suspect the skunks were infected with canine distemper, which is a neurological virus that can be transferred between animals through saliva. Symptoms include disorientation and difficulty maneuvering.

Officials with Wildwoods Animal Rehabilitation Center say that there is no cause for alarm but if you sight an animal in obvious distress you should call police.

"Distemper in no way impacts humans, so it's not an illness that we can contract," said Animal Care Supervisor Sarah Glesner. "Also everyone that I know that is a pet owner gets their animals vaccinated on an annual basis, so that distemper vaccine completely protects your dog or your cat."

Authorities say outbreaks of distemper normally occur about every 10 years and are most common in the spring.
