The cause of an outbreak of a rare strain of _E. coli_ in Dorset is still unknown, health officials have said. The number of people affected has risen to 18 in the past month. Nursery children were among those infected with _E. coli_ O55, which can lead to kidney problems in some cases.

Public Health England (PHE) said the outbreak was being taken "very seriously." Clusters of the strain have not been identified in England since records began in 1994. Noeleen McFarland, a consultant in health protection at PHE said: "It has been thoroughly investigated from the 1st outbreaks, but with the small number of cases, it is difficult to tell people what the source is. Until we can identify a particular source, it's important to get that general advice out about good hand hygiene."

Public Health England said any previous cases of the O55 strain had been associated with travel. 10 people in the Blandford area of Dorset were diagnosed with the bacterial illness between July and November 2014, PHE said. A further 2 cases have been identified in Portland, 4 in Bournemouth and Poole, as well as 3 cases outside the county which have links to Dorset.

Samples from more than 400 family members and friends of those affected have been analyzed. Experts are looking for any link, including restaurants or supermarkets they have visited, as well as local water supplies, in order to pinpoint the cause of the outbreak.

Those affected include children at Blandford Children's Centre Nursery which reopened earlier this week following a deep clean. Seven of the children developed the kidney problems, but there have been no deaths, PHE confirmed. Two children remain in hospital.
