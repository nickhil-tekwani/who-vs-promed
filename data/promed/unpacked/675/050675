Cows and buffalos in Terengganu have been hit by the disease hemorrhagic
septicemia again, with 88 deaths reported in the last 6 days.
Hemorrhagic septicemia is caused by a serotype of _Pasteurella multocida_
and spread throughout the body by the blood. The deaths took place in
Kampung Gong Lingai and Kampung Lingai in Kuala Nerus.
State Veterinary Services Department director Dr Ibrahim Che Embong said
the 88 cows and buffalos belonged to 12 breeders whose total loss had been
estimated at more than RM100 000.
"We are taking a very serious view of this and have recalled department
officials on leave to control the disease," he said.
Dr Ibrahim said septicemia was first detected in Kampung Bukit Tunggal on 4
Jan 2000 and later in other nearby kampungs. Only 13 cows died then and the
situation was brought under control.
In this outbreak, the bulk of the deaths, numbering 70, occurred in Kampung
Gong Lingai. The victims were mostly wild buffalos. Diseases in wild
animals can be difficult to control.
Dr Ibrahim expressed disappointment the affected breeders did not report
the fresh attack of the disease until Monday, by which time 70 deaths had
occurred. "We visited the 2 (affected) kampungs today and suspect the
outbreak was caused by the slaughtering of cows or the movement of
livestock from the Bukit Tunggal area to Lingai," he added.
