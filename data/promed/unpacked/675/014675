High Rates Of Cervical Carcinoma In Mexico Associated With HPV16 Variant
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A sexually transmitted virus that [is associated with cervical cancer may
be found more frequently in Mexico than most other parts of the world, and
may account for the high number of new cases of cervical cancer there,
according to recent research. Cervical cancer is one of the most common
female cancers worldwide, and Mexico has one of the highest rates of
cervical cancer, with an estimated 16 000 new cases developing each year.
According to the authors of a newly published paper, the high rate of
cervical cancer in Mexico may be due in part to inadequate screening, but
may also be due to a [genetic variant of Human papillomavirus type 16
(HPV16), which is prevalent in the Mexican population.
HPV16 has a number of different genetic variants, each found in different
regions throughout the world. Asian-American (AA) variants are found mainly
in Central and South America, Mexico and Spain; and European variants
appear everywhere except Africa. In an earlier study, researchers led by
Dr. Jaime Berumen of the Universidad del Ejercito y Fuerza Aerea, Mexico,
found that the AA variants were frequently present in Mexican women with
cervical cancer. But they were not sure whether the high rate of cervical
cancer in Mexico occurred because the AA variant is more likely to cause
cancer than other strains. In their current study, published in the 15 Sep
2001 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Berumen's team
tested 181 samples of cervical cells from women with cancer and compared
them with samples from 181 women without cervical cancer. The investigators
found HPV16 in about half of the women with cancer, but in only 11% of the
women without cancer. And the frequency of the AA variant was 21 times
higher in the cancer patients than in the women without cancer, suggesting
that infection with the AA variant was especially likely to result in
cervical cancer.
According to Berumen, the women infected with the AA variant had a risk of
developing cervical cancer 27 times higher than the women not infected with
that variant, but women infected with the European variant had only a 3.3
times higher risk of developing cervical cancer. The findings also suggest
that the AA variant causes cancer at an earlier age than the European
variant, Berumen told Reuters Health. "Women with cancer who were infected
with the AA HPV variant were, on average, 8 years younger than those
infected with the European variant," he said.

be considered with caution since other types of Human papillomavirus
(particularly HPV18) are frequently present together with HPV16 in cervical
carcinoma tissue. It will be relevant also to establish the relationship of
the AA variant to cervical carcinoma in Mexican women. - Mod.CP
