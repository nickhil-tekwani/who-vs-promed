With the death of one more person due to encephalitis in Uttar
Pradesh today [22 Dec 2009], the statewide toll due to the disease
rose to 567, officials said. The patient died at BRD Medical College
Hospital [in Gorakhpur], they said.

As many as 52 encephalitis patients are undergoing treatment at BRD
hospital, while 2 are being treated at other government hospitals of
the region, they said. "However, the cases of Japanese encephalitis,
caused due to mosquito bites, have substantially dropped due to fall
in temperature resulting in low mosquito density," additional
director of health LP Rawat said.

[The number of encephalitis cases has increased by 7 since the 14 Dec
2009 report (see ProMED archive no. 20091214.4241). There is no
information indicating how many of these recent cases are due to
Japanese encephalitis virus an how many to another etiological agent,
perhaps enteroviruses or Nipah virus.
