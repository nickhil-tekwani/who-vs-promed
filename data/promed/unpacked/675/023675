[Although the post reports 56 cases hospitalized, the numbers following do
not add up to 56. The manifestations of tularemia and the methods of
diagnosis are not stated. Such information could be useful in elucidating
the mode of transmission (insect or tick bite), exposure to other animals,
or water-borne. - Mod.LL]
