The Corral Hospital, in the southern Chilean city of Corral, was
emptied this past Thursday [24 Mar 2011] after 2 patients tested
positive for fatal hantavirus [infections]. This relates to 2 women,
ages 31 and 51 years, who died as a consequence of the diseases
[virus] transmitted through urine and excretions of the so called
long-tailed rat [long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_] when they were treated in the intensive care unit of
the regional hospital in the city of Valdivia.

The youngest of these victims was an assistant in the unit. In
addition to these, a woman of 60 years who died hours shortly before,
also in Valdivia, presented with similar symptoms which, until now,
have not been confirmed as related to the same disease.

The Director of the Corral Hospital, Marianela Caro, said that they
are evaluating the working conditions of the employees, looking for
the focus of the infection. "Up until now, we have not discarded the
focus of infection could be in the hospital, nor that it could be in
the homes of those patients," she stated to the radio Cooperativa.

In any event, the Mayor of the City, Gaston Perez, confirmed that the
temporary closure of the the hospital "Is to be assured that the
situation would not be as serious as one might think."

[The specific hantavirus involved with these cases of suspected
hantavirus infection in Chile is not indicated. The virus most likely
to be responsible for this case is Andes virus, with the long-tailed
pygmy rice rat as its rodent host.
