There have been 9 confirmed rabid bats in San Bernardino County including 4 within the past 2 weeks [2nd half of July 2020] in Rancho Cucamonga, Fontana and Apple Valley. San Bernardino County Public Health is urging the public to protect themselves and their pets from interactions with unfamiliar, stray or wild animals.

"Rabies is almost always fatal in humans once symptoms begin," stated Dr. Erin Gustafson, County Interim Health Officer. "It is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible for any animal bite or possible rabies exposure."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common wild reservoirs of rabies are raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Domestic mammals can also get rabies. Cats, cattle, and dogs are the most frequently reported rabid domestic animals in the USA. Rabies among domestic animals is rare with animal vaccination programs.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, with infections almost always fatal unless treated. Also, a dog, cat or ferret infected with a bat rabies virus can infect a human. - Mod.PMB
