Enquiry Into Queniborough vCJD Cluster Appears to Be Stalled
------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 5 people, aged between 18 and 35, who lived within 3 miles of
each other near Queniborough, Leicestershire, have died of [new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) since 1998. Dr Philip Monk, a communicable
disease control consultant, and his colleague Dr Gerry Bryant, have been
seeking a cause of the cluster of 5 deaths for the last 4 months. Because
of the long incubation period of the disease they have been seeking a
common factor from as far back as the early eighties [1980s. Yesterday, in
a report of their progress to the County Health Authority, they ruled out
baby foods, school meals, drinking water, occupational exposure, injections
or animal bites as possible causes. All the victims ate meat or meat
products, including beef, but the affected families did not use the same
butcher, nor had they attended a common social event, such as an ox-roast.
Although a local scandal involving the supply of knacker's yard meat for
human consumption had occurred in the area, no link between this and the
deaths was found. The team said that the absence of records about farming,
market auctions, slaughtering and butchering practices at the time posed a
problem. "Given the passage of time since the common 'window' of exposure
of the vCJD victims , some of those involved in the farming and meat trades
are now elderly, in poor health or have died." The team said they were
still conducting interviews and added: "When we have completed these our
intention will be to develop a theory linking all the cases in this cluster."
The team also reported that at least one local cat had died from feline
CJD, further confirming that the disease [BSE or vCJD? was active in the
area, which includes 13 small [farming communities.

[This investigation has so far failed to identify any unique factor which
might explain the cluster of cases. It might be relevant now to look for
possible distinguishing features in the infecting agent (prion). - Mod.CP
