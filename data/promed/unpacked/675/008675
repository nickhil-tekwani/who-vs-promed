Scrub typhus, also known as the World War II fever, is back this monsoon to haunt inhabitants, particularly the rural folk in HP [Himachal Pradesh]. So far, 137 people across the state have tested positive for the fever. The outbreak is more evident in Bilaspur district [Himachal Pradesh] where 29 people have tested positive so far. As many as 36 patients infested with rickettsial-scrub typhus have been hospitalised at the Indira Gandhi Medical College. The number of patients with scrub typhus was more in the low lying areas -- 69 patients have been treated in the Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda.

The revival of monsoons has made the conditions congenial for the spread of scrub typhus. The department of health has issued a circular to all chief medical officers, block medical officers, and authorities of government-run hospitals to make adequate arrangements for combating the fever that takes a toll on humans every year.

The health department has asked the government to distribute handbills among the general public to make them aware of the symptoms of and treatment for scrub typhus. Further, the health institutions across the state have been asked to adequately stock doxycycline and azithromycin. "Directions have already been issued to all the medical officers for the use of doxycycline and azithromycin in any suspected cases of scrub typhus," said a senior government functionary. A health official at the directorate of health said directions had been issued to all block medical officers and hospital in charges for daily audit of scrub typhus cases.

Scrub typhus resurges every monsoon and has claimed many lives in the last eight years. Since 2006, more than 159 people have died due to the disease while 8498 have tested positive.

Rodents may serve as reservoirs, although transovarial transmission in mites is the dominant mechanism for maintenance of _ Orientia tsutsugamushi_ (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/9/12/03-0212_article). Humans become infected when they accidentally encroach in an area where the chigger-rodent cycle is occurring, most often areas of low-lying scrub brush or transitional vegetation. Patients with severe scrub typhus can develop multiorgan failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy with hemorrhage. Establishing the diagnosis and initiating prompt antimicrobial drug therapy are important, because death rates for untreated scrub typhus patients are 1-30 per cent (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/2/pdfs/v12-n2.pdf). Scrub typhus is effectively treated with doxycycline, and treatment should begin immediately upon suspicion of illness without awaiting laboratory confirmation. Azithromycin is an alternative in children and pregnant women with scrub typhus (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/9/1329.full).

The Weil-Felix test, an agglutination test for the diagnosis of rickettsial disease, is based on the detection of antibodies to various _Proteus_ species, which contain antigens that cross-react with rickettsial antigens. This test has poor sensitivity and specificity, but continues to be used in resource-poor regions (http://www.japi.org/august2006/O-619.pdf). Because of the relatively poor sensitivity and specificity of this test, more specific assays can be used for diagnosis, including complement fixation. The gold standard for the diagnosis of scrub typhus is the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but the fluorescence microscopes that are required for performance of this assay are often not available in resource-poor settings where scrub typhus is endemic. Dipstick assays (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12479551) have been developed that are easy to perform and do not require sophisticated equipment, making them suitable for use in rural areas where more sophisticated diagnostic tests such as the IFA may not be available.

Bilaspur is a city and a municipal council in Bilaspur district in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilaspur,_Himachal_Pradesh). Himachal Pradesh is a mountainous state in northwestern India with an elevation ranging from about 350 meters (1148 feet) to 7000 meters (22 966 feet) above sea level and has one of the highest per capita incomes of any state in India (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himachal_Pradesh).

Himachal Pradesh can be located on a map of India at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:India_Himachal_Pradesh_locator_map.svg. A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India that shows the state of Himachal Pradesh can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=2627698,20503. - Mod.ML]
