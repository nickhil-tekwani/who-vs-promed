Ebola Response Roadmap Situation Report 5 Nov 2014
Highlights
-------------
There have been 13 042 reported cases of Ebola, with 4818 reported deaths, up to the end of 2 Nov [2014].

All districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have been affected.

All 83 contacts of the health-care worker infected in Spain have completed 21-day follow-up [and were negative].

Summary
-------
A total of 13 042 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 6 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) and 2 previously affected countries (Nigeria and Senegal) up to the end of 2 Nov [2014]. There have been 4818 reported deaths.

The outbreaks of EVD in Senegal and Nigeria were declared over on 17 Oct and 19 Oct 2014, respectively.

At the country level, the weekly incidence appears to be stable in Guinea. In Sierra Leone, the weekly incidence continues to rise, while in Liberia, it appears to be declining. In all 3 countries, EVD transmission remains persistent and widespread, particularly in the capital cities. All administrative districts in Liberia and Sierra Leone have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the outbreak began. Cases and deaths continue to be under-reported in this outbreak. Of the countries with localized transmission, Mali and the United States of America continue to monitor potential contacts... - more

[2] West Africa: US army Wi-Fi
Date: Wed 29 Oct 2014
Source: DISA [edited]
http://www.nextgov.com/defense/2014/10/us-army-will-provide-wi-fi-other-communications-ngos-fight-against-ebola/97709/


The US Defense Department has started to beef up systems needed to support troops and non-governmental organizations engaged in the Ebola fight in West Africa, including e-mail, video and satellite systems.

The Defense Information Systems Agency [DISA] last week [19-25 Oct 2014] turned on a node of the Blue Force Tracking System [BFT] over West Africa, which transmits feeds from GPS receivers over satellites to a central node to pinpoint locations. This will enable real-time messaging and location-status information for vehicles and individuals.

The system, part of the Army Warrior Information-Tactical battlefield network or WIN-T network, will be used by the 4000 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division when they deploy to West Africa this month [October 2014], said Lt. Col. Joel Babbitt, the WIN-T product manager. The networks the Army is setting up in West Africa will support both military users and NGOs, such as Doctors without Borders [MSF], Babbit said. WIN-T will provide the NGOs "with the communications reach-back that will allow them to coordinate their efforts as an entire task force," he said. "It will make our response to the Ebola crisis much more coordinated and much more effective."

Lt. Col. Michael Olmstead, product manager for the Joint Battle Command-Platform, which manages BFT, said the Army has set up commercial internet enclaves the NGOs can use with a hub in Landstuhl, Germany. These hubs will provide reach-back access to the Army global information network to transmit voice and data. "Since they are commercial enclaves, you can go and buy commercial items like a WiFi hotspot, plug them in directly, and you instantly have a connection," Babbitt said. "The Army is providing the communications backbone for what is inherently a civil response. As engineers flow in to build treatment facilities, they will be operating directly with these NGOs, so the ability to provide a common backbone via commercial internet is critical to an assistance response task force."

The Army plans to deploy WIN-T in packages to West Africa, including network nodes and command post systems. The Army also accelerated efforts to upgrade units' modems, allowing for higher bandwidth to support the anticipated demand for medical information and other data. The modem upgrade, like the drive to expand commercial Internet capability for expeditionary signal battalions, was already underway prior to Operation United Assistance, so the Army was poised for rapid response. "It highlights the importance of continually modernizing the network so that you can provide these sorts of capabilities when required," Babbitt said.

Tracy Sharpe, a DISA spokeswoman, said the agency is providing long-haul communications capabilities to extend Africa Command networks and DISA Enterprise Services, such as email and video, to West Africa. DISA has also stood up a "community of interest," within its All Partners Access Network to enable unclassified information sharing with other DOD entities, interagency partners, NGOs and coalition partners. APAN is a DISA-managed unclassified collaboration platform accessible via the commercial Internet for groups who do not possess access to traditional DOD systems and networks.

[Re: comment at the end of ProMED Ebola virus disease - ex Africa (26): USA quarantines, drug, vaccines, WHO 20141027.2906997: A trial of the GSK vaccine was planned for Mali, but now that an unknown number of people there have been exposed to the little girl from Guinea, it may be difficult to find a large group of unexposed people in Mali. - Mod.JW]

The studies, which are ongoing in Mali, are Phase 1 safety studies, similar to the studies that are ongoing in the UK and the US. That there has been a case of Ebola in Mali is unlikely to have any impact on the safety studies there. As far as I am aware, there are certainly no plans for a Phase III study in Mali, but they are planned in the 3 currently affected West African countries.

[4] Liberia: survivors help out
Date: Fri 31 Oct 2014

http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-31/in-liberia-ebola-survivors-find-they-have superpowers?utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&utm_campaign=social


Yesterday [30 Oct 2014], Dr. Darin Portnoy, a family physician from the Bronx, completed his 1st rounds -- 60 patients, 5 of them children -- in an Ebola ward of a treatment center in Paynesville, about 250 miles southeast of Monrovia, Liberia. He's been impressed from the start by the efficiency of the clinic, but what struck him the most was watching as an Ebola survivor, a man he describes as looking a little like Mike Tyson [the champion boxer], scooped up an 11-year-old boy in the infectious stages of the disease, carried him to a washbasin, and gave him a sponge bath, before carefully returning him to his cot.

Survivors, Portnoy says, are playing an increasing role in caring for the sick and the effort outside the wards to halt the epidemic. Ebola survivors are immune to the virus for as long as 3 months or longer. Research indicates immunity to re-infection by the same strain of Ebola virus could last 10 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]. This means they can risk getting close to those with symptoms, and even touch them, something that's especially helpful with children, a number of whom are separated from their families. "It's kind of like a superpower," Portnoy says of the survivors' immunity. "Even those who are not fully recovered, but that you can tell are going to clear the virus, they'll help other patients before they've finished convalescing," he adds.

This is Week One of Portnoy's 4-week stint at ELWA3, an Ebola treatment center with 250 beds in Paynesville. ELWA3 is operated by Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders, the privately funded relief organization often known simply as MSF. The staff at the center totals around 700, about 100 of whom are from outside West Africa. MSF has similar, smaller facilities in the neighboring countries of Sierra Leone and Guinea, where Ebola remains out of control.

Portnoy has just arrived as a volunteer. On his rounds, he isn't working solo, of course. A nurse and sanitation aide, also suited head-to-toe in personal protection equipment (PPE), accompany him; assistants are available, as well, to help clean patients and disinfect around them. "I had a couple of dry runs, where we put on the PPEs, took off the PPEs," the 52-year-old doctor says. "Then I did one round where I only spoke to patients."

Portnoy provides his patients with anti-malaria and anti-nausea medicines, generic Tylenol and antibiotics, and hydration salts. Severe dehydration is the underlying, grave danger with Ebola. Via phone, Portnoy confirmed the press reports and World Health Organization figures showing that, for the 1st time in weeks, there are fewer new cases of Ebola in Liberia. At ELWA3, empty beds outnumber the patients, and only about 80 to 85 confirmed cases remain.

Did this decline strike those who'd been there all summer as cause for optimism that there won't be, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned, as many as 5000 new cases a week by January [2015]?

"It would be great to think so," Portnoy says, but no one at ELWA3 believes it's over yet. "For us, it's more a chance to prepare, build capacity, train as many people as we can, and be ready." To hear him tell it, ELWA3 is becoming an Ebola-treatment teaching hospital.

The reason it was too soon to declare victory, he says, is that "a lot of things that should be working are not. Contact tracing -- tracking those who may have been exposed -- is not working. The ambulances are not fully functioning. It's hard to tell if safe burial practices are really being observed. So we are staying vigilant."

As for the survivors, getting clear of the virus is just part of a long journey. "Some [survivors] want to return to their communities, kind of anonymously, because there's still a lot of stigma," says Athena Viscusi, a New Yorker who ran the mental health intervention center at ELWA3 until last week. (MSF mental health workers provide grief counseling to families and help to caregivers, too, as the work is often traumatic.) "Usually, though, Ebola has affected several members of the family, and the neighbors know there's been an infection in the house, so they can't return quietly," Viscusi says. "And they find they're more comfortable coming back to the Ebola centers, because we're very welcoming of them."

MSF hires some of these returning survivors to work with patients. Of the man who helped the child, says Portnoy: "You know you hear about things like that, but when you see it, that whatever someone is going through, their humanity remains intact, it's magnificent."... - more

[5] Sierra Leone: Ambulance services
Date: Thu 30 Oct 2014
Source: WSJ [edited]
http://online.wsj.com/articles/in-sierra-leone-ambulances-carry-ebola-patients-big-questions-1414686785


Boarding an ambulance in Freetown last Fri [24 Oct 2014], a pair of Ebola patients began what some in Sierra Leone call the journey of no return. On a blazing afternoon, an ambulance transporting a brother and sister arrived at the Red Cross Ebola clinic just outside the town of Kenema, a 4-hour and 190-mile drive from Sierra Leone's capital. A child's wails could be heard while a team of 6 health workers disinfected the vehicle. A naked 14-year-old boy later stepped out, but not his younger sister. "She's dead," shouted one worker near the vehicle. The ambulance then drove slowly to the back of the clinic, where her corpse was unloaded at the morgue.

Sierra Leone's ambulances zip down freeways, blow by crowded street markets, and bob over rutted jungle roads. Yet all that movement has exposed a dangerously disjointed emergency-response system, one that sends gravely ill patients across the country for hospital beds they sometimes don't live to see. That has prompted a rethinking of how the country dispatches its emergency vehicles, in the hope of establishing a template for other countries battling Ebola. "The ambulance link is really important and it's not quite working" said Steve McAndrew, Freetown-based head of emergency operations for the Ebola Virus Response at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. "It may be making matters worse."

Until recently, Sierra Leone's ministry of health handled calls for emergency vehicles and then sent word to its local officers to follow up. Now, the nation's president has appointed a former soldier to head its new National Ebola Response Center. District Ebola Response Centers will track the status of patients who need to get to a hospital; or persons who need to be monitored; or bodies that need to be buried. "This new organization is not a talking shop," said retired Maj. Palo Conteh, the new Ebola czar, on Wed [29 Oct 29014]. "It's a place of action." Maj. Conteh said soldiers would be trained as drivers and appealed for more vehicles, but didn't elaborate on why the existing ambulances are traveling so far afield...

Despite having Ebola clinics in Freetown, ambulances often transport suspected patients far beyond the capital, in a sign of the poor coordination matching Ebola patients with available beds. Health workers describe opening ambulance doors and seeing piles of people soaked in vomit, blood and excrement. Not long after the Red Cross opened its 1st Ebola treatment center in Kenema in September [2014], an ambulance arrived with 12 Ebola patients crammed inside the sport-utility vehicle. Other emergency vehicles appear unexpectedly, sometimes not having identification for the patients, sometimes not knowing what hospital dispatched them...

Unlike Liberia and Guinea, where disease is concentrated in pockets, Sierra Leone's Ebola cases stretch across the country, from the metal shacks of coastal Freetown to the mud huts of Kailahun near the eastern border. Some ambulances have showed up at Kailahun from Freetown in search of empty beds at the local Ebola treatment center, said doctors and ambulance drivers. The last stretch of that 250-mile journey is over roads that are little more than brown gashes cut through jungle shrubs and trees. "The distances are too much to take for patients who are very weak," says Mohamed Kamara, a 37-year-old ambulance driver in Kailahun. "Some lose their lives."

Public-health experts said they suspect the shuffle has had as much to do with the search for empty beds as it has with moving those with Ebola away from clinics and hospitals that aren't prepared to treat them. The long ambulance trips, said John Otoo, a World Health Organization official in Kailahun, "puts strain on the system and the patient."...

Kenie Lahi, the 52-year-old chief ambulance driver for Kailahun, said he requires his drivers to don personal protective equipment, including goggles and rubber gloves. That requirement was put in place after 2 of his drivers died of Ebola as the outbreak began to spread out of control in June [2014]. Some ambulance drivers said they face hostile communities, residents of which sometimes throw stones at vehicles to prevent them from taking away neighbors.

Bottles of water are placed in the back for patients to slake their thirst in the scorching heat. But for the very sick, even holding a bottle can prove too difficult. Those who arrive alive at an Ebola clinic may be too drained to put up much of a fight later... - more

More than 2600 cots were sent from US Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services sites on 9 Oct [2014] to contribute to DLA's effort to provide food, water, cots and tents to support Operation United Assistance, the U.S. effort to stop the spread of Ebola virus in West Africa.

"DLA's job is to use our logistical might to set conditions of success for everyone going into Africa," said Army Col. Eric Sloughfy, chief of the DLA Joint Logistics Operations Center. Personnel from DLA Disposition Services and DLA Distribution in Jacksonville, Florida worked to move out 1728 cots, while people in Gulfport, Mississippi were preparing another 900 they received from the Naval Construction Battalion Center there.

Altogether, 2628 cots were provided... - more

[7] Guinea: South African tycoon donates USD 1 million
Date: 29 Oct 2014

South Africa's 1st black billionaire, Patrice Motsepe, has donated USD one million (GBL 620 000) to Guinea to help the country fight Ebola. ... The mining magnate said he hoped it would assist with clinical management, social mobilisation and other key steps in controlling the deadly virus. His donation was announced as the USA praised the international aid effort.

Mr Motsepe, who is chairman of the mining company African Rainbow Minerals and has set up the charitable Motsepe Foundation, urged other Africans in business to continue making contributions to fight Ebola.

America's UN envoy Samantha Power, on a visit to the region, praised the efforts of Ebola-hit nations and foreign donors and urged them to continue to help.

[8] Sierra Leone: state of emergency extended, journalist jailed

Police in Sierra Leone have jailed a journalist in the capital Freetown under emergency measures introduced to help the West African country cope with the Ebola epidemic, a senior police source said on Tue [4 Nov 2014].

David Tam-Baryoh was sent to the Pademba Road prison on an executive order from the president, according to Chief Superintendent Ibrahim Koroma. "The powers were derived from the Ebola emergency regulations the country is currently under," Koroma said, without detailing the charges against the journalist or specifying the length of his detention.

The arrest may be linked to comments made by Tam-Baryoh on his popular radio program MONOLGUE in which he appeared to challenge arrests made last week [beginning 26 Oct 2014] in the Kono district after Ebola-linked riots. The Sierra Leone Association of Journalists condemned the arrest.
