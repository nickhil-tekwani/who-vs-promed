Nigeria has found cases of "highly pathogenic" bird flu in 3 new
states including one in the far south, indicating that the virus has
spread all over Africa's most populous country despite measures to
contain it.
The disease, which has killed hundreds of thousands of poultry, is
present from Katsina state in the far north on the border with Niger,
to Rivers state, 1400 km (900 miles) away on the southern Gulf of
Guinea coast.
The World Organisation for Animal Health confirmed Africa's 1st
outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain in northern Kaduna state on 8 Feb
2006, and Nigerian authorities have now detected bird flu in a total
of 11 states.
Nigerian labs are able to identify bird flu, but not to determine
whether it is the H5N1 strain which has spread from Asia and killed
at least 95 people in 7 countries since late 2003.
A U.N. reference laboratory in the Italian city of Padua has
confirmed that H5N1 was present in 5 states [for their identity, see
commentary further], and further tests were pending on samples from 6
other states, the government crisis management centre said.
The 3 states where bird flu outbreaks have been newly reported are
Rivers in the far south, Anambra in the southeast and Benue in the
centre. The crisis management centre said a highly pathogenic form of
bird flu was present in all 3 but could not yet say if it was H5N1.
"The culling of infected birds and decontamination of the affected
areas in the 3 states has commenced," Information Minister Frank
Nweke said in a statement.
The Rivers outbreak is in Port Harcourt, the main city in the
oil-producing Niger Delta and one of Nigeria's biggest.
In northern Kano state, one of the worst-hit, the government began
compensating farmers on Monday. It handed over a first batch of
cheques worth a total of 23.5 million naira (USD 184 000) to 47
affected farms.
After H5N1 was confirmed in Kaduna, the government ordered that all
suspect poultry be culled, all suspect farms quarantined and poultry
from affected states should not be transported.
But lack of resources to implement these measures meant very little
happened on the ground initially, and panic selling of chickens
contributed to spreading the disease. Farmers in affected areas had
no protective equipment and handled diseased or dead poultry with
their bare hands.
No human case of bird flu has been found in Nigeria, but a laboratory
in Britain has begun testing samples from 4 possible cases including
a woman who died on 16 Feb 2006 after being exposed to diseased
poultry and suffering respiratory problems.
Millions of Nigerians keep chickens in their backyards and fears of
poultry-to-human infections are high.
The conditions for detecting any human case are difficult as Nigeria
has high mortality rates from a variety of diseases, health services
in rural areas are almost non-existent and people are often buried
without any medical checks.

[According to Nigeria's official follow-up report to the OIE, dated 5
Mar 2006, the new outbreaks, confirmed as H5N1, have been identified
in the following 5 main administrative divisions: Anambra State,
Benue State, Federal Capital Territory, Plateau State and Rivers
State. The report includes additional statistical information on the
outbreaks, and the following description: "The affected farms are
mostly commercial and backyard poultry layer production units inside
towns except the farm at Benue which had a mixture of 500 free range
local birds and 100 ducks."

[2] Serbia-Montenegro: swans, first cases
Date: Tue, 7 Mar 2006

There have been 3 cases of the avian flu registered in Serbia thus
far. Currently, Backi Monostor and Bacevci, where swans infected with
the virus were found dead, have been declared danger zones. The zones
run 10 km in all directions from where the infected birds were found,
which coincides with protective measures implemented all over Europe
in such cases.
Veterinary Administration Chief Dejan Krnjajic said that all of the
agency's attention has been placed on making sure that the virus is
not found in any livestock or domesticated birds, adding that he is
surprised by the appearance of the bird flu in Bajina Basta, since
the Balkans are not where swans typically spend their winters.
"We will now be waiting for the arrival of birds from Nigeria, and
they could come in contact with domestic and wild birds on every body
of water on the way, so there will be increased risk of domestic
birds being infected. As a result, the risk of human infection
increases. We cannot control the movement of wild birds, but we can
prohibit people from keeping poultry outside and we can follow the
movement of wild birds." Krnjajic said.
He added that his administration continues to follow all procedures
rigorously for the control of avian flu.

[Sombor is situated in northwest Serbia, facing east Croatia:
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=290_0_4&language=1>.
A previous newswire from the same source, dated 2 Mar 2006, included
the following initial information:
"It has been confirmed that a swan found dead 20 km from Sombor was
infected with the H5 strain of the bird flu. The swan was found in
the Veliki Backi canal, in the municipality of Sombor, and according
to the diagnosis, the swan died because of the H5 bird flu, according
to the Serbian Agriculture Ministry's Veterinary Council.
The remains of the swan were taken in for analysis at the Veterinary
Institute in Novi Sad and the Veterinary Specialist Institute in
Kraljevo, where it was confirmed that the avian flu strain was
present and responsible for the swan's death.
The findings will be sent to England and the Weybridge laboratories
in order to be confirmed. The Agriculture Ministry has stated that
Serbia has been in the process of taking preventative safety measures
against the spread of the bird flu long before this first case was
uncovered".
This 1st reported case of H5 avian influenza in an avian in Serbia
should not surprise; infections have already been found in the
neighbouring countries Hungary, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and
Romania. - Mod.AS]

[3] Austria, cat infection inconclusive

An Austrian cat which has twice tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu
virus did not show the virus in a 3rd probe on Tuesday [7 Mar 2006],
Austria's health ministry said, adding to uncertainty about the
infection in cats.
The cat is one of 170 that were kept in an animal sanctuary in
southern Austria close to a cage of fowl which had been infected with
H5N1. 3 cats tested positive for the virus in saliva tests last week,
Austria said on Monday.
A subsequent test of the 3 cats' faeces confirmed H5N1 in only one of
the samples, in a very low concentration. A 3rd faeces test taken on
Tuesday was negative for all of them, a health ministry spokeswoman
said.
However, the spokeswoman added the ministry was still waiting for the
results of tests on the cats' blood.
"Apparently cats are more resistant than chickens," the spokeswoman
said. "That you find the virus in the mouth apparently doesn't mean
that it reaches the other end too."
The 170 cats, 40 of which had been saliva-tested in the Noah's Ark
sanctuary in the city of Graz, were brought to a quarantine centre
close to Vienna for observation and tests.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Tuesday that more studies
were needed on infections in cats, including how they shed the virus
in their environment.
The WHO asked Austria to provide more detail on the cats, adding that
it was potentially significant that an animal could contract the
virus and not show any symptoms of illness.
Johann Thalhammer, a professor at Vienna's veterinary university who
is now monitoring the cats, said he could not confirm that they did
not have any symptoms of the virus.
"There were no symptoms that the people in the sanctuary noticed,"
Thalhammer told Reuters. "How exactly they were observing the cats in
the sanctuary I don't know. What we are looking for now is: are there
more cats testing positive? Are those which are infected showing any
symptoms that can be correlated to the virus?" he added.
Bird flu can wipe out poultry flocks in the space of 48 hours and can
also infect people who come into close contact with infected birds.
It has killed at least 95 people in Asia and the Middle East since
late 2003.
