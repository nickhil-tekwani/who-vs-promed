People exposed to camel herds in which MERS-CoV is endemic showed no evidence of infection, according to a study published yesterday [12 Jan 2015] in [the monthly] 'Emerging Infectious Diseases'.

Researchers from the University of Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia's King Faisal University tested serum from 191 people in the Saudi Arabian town of Al-Ahsa (also called Al-Hasa). Subjects had varying degrees of exposure to a local dromedary camel herd in which MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) is endemic.

Most study subjects (146 people) lived in Al-Ahsa but were not directly exposed to camels. Other subjects included 4 people who had daily contact with and drank raw milk from the infected herd, 8 people with intermittent herd contact, 30 veterinary staff who were not exposed to the herd but had other animal contact, and 3 slaughterhouse workers.

None of the 191 people tested from December 2013 to February 2014 showed signs of infection or had MERS-CoV serum antibodies. Results suggest that zoonotic transmission of MERS from infected camels to humans is rare, the authors conclude.

The researchers advocate additional research to further understand the epidemiologic patterns of MERS exposure and incidence in human populations.

[The above "ahead of print" paper's details are: Hemida MG, Al-Naeem A, Perera RAPM, Chin AWH, Poon LLM, Peiris M. Lack of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission from infected camels. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015 Apr [cited 17 Jan 2015] http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2104.141949.

The paper's "conclusions" section follows (2 of the references retained; for the others, please refer to the original paper):

"We conclude that MERS-CoV was not highly transmissible from dromedaries to humans with various levels of exposure to this infected dromedary herd. Two other studies have reported lack of serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection among persons with various levels of exposure to dromedaries (Refs 1, 2), but neither study documented MERS-CoV infection in the relevant animals. Studies of MERS-CoV RNA prevalence in nasal swab specimens from dromedaries in the field or abattoirs have found rates of 0-15 percent (by PCR) among adults and 35 percent among calves (1 study).

A study limitation is that precise events of individual-level human exposure to infected animals cannot be ascertained because different animals were infected at different times over the 1-month period. The timing of serum collection (4-6 weeks after putative exposure) from persons exposed to the infected herd was optimal in terms of detecting a serologic response. However, data on antibody titers after asymptomatic or mild MERS-CoV infections are limited, and our conclusion about lack of human infection must be subject to that caveat.

Our findings do not imply that dromedaries are not a source of infection for humans. Spillover infection of humans may be more common in other settings in which humans are exposed over sustained periods to animals among which virus prevalence is higher. For example, animals from diverse origins with varying immune status that are housed together in abattoirs before slaughter may provide opportunity for virus amplification and persistence, analogous to that seen with avian influenza virus in live poultry markets. Our study period (December-February) was timed to coincide with the calving season. However, human cases seem to peak during April-June, although this peak may be skewed by clusters of human-to-human transmission. Future longitudinal studies of dromedaries should be of longer duration.

Our finding that MERS-CoV is poorly transmissible from dromedaries to humans is compatible with the observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in humans, in which human disease is not directly proportional to potential exposure to a virus that seems to be common in dromedary camels. Infections in dromedaries in settings such as abattoirs are regularly documented; thus, the numbers of humans exposed to virus-infected animals must greatly exceed the number of humans with diagnosed MERS-CoV infection. Conversely, some persons seem to acquire infection with apparently minimal or no apparent exposure to camels, even when secondary transmission from other infected humans is excluded. This setting is analogous to that observed for avian influenza (H5N1) virus, in which the virus can be ubiquitous in live poultry markets in some settings but human infection and disease remain stochastic and rare (i.e., not directly proportional to exposure). The biological basis for such an epidemiologic pattern remains obscure for both viruses, avian influenza (H5N1) and MERS-CoV, but the heterogeneity of host susceptibility is a hypothesis to be explored. Further studies on the mechanisms by which MERS-CoV is transmitted from dromedaries to humans, whether by direct or indirect routes, and the heterogeneity of human susceptibility to this virus are needed."

It deserves to be noted that prior to the findings in dromedary camels, the possible role of bats as the MERS-CoV reservoir (similar to the SARS coronavirus), even if not direct source of human infection, was suggested. This issue was subject to a 2013 research project in Saudi Arabia (Ref 3). The investigators trapped, in and around the locations of human infections Bisha, Unaizah, and Riyadh, 96 bats representing 7 species (_Rhinopoma hardwickii_, _Rhinopoma microphyllum_, _Taphozous perforatus_, _Pipistrellus kuhlii_, _Eptesicus bottae_, _Eidolon helvum_, and _Rousettus aegyptiacus_). One single bat, trapped in the vicinity of a location where a MERS-CoV human patient was diagnosed (Bisha), was found to be excreting a virus, a fragment of which found by the authors to show "100 percent nucleotide identity to the coronavirus from the human index case". This bat was identified as _Taphozous perforatus_, the "Egyptian tomb bat". The distribution range of this insectivore bat includes sub-Saharan Africa, the Nile valley and territories eastwards as far as Pakistan and north-western India. Details and findings of this and other research projects addressing the origin of MERS-CoV and its epidemiology were presented and discussed by several speakers during the recent IMED 2014 meeting in Vienna. The bat's distribution map was included in the presentation (slide 33) of K. Olival, "Why Did the Camel Kiss the Bat?", available at http://imed.isid.org/downloads/IMED2014_Presentations/IMED2014_Olival1.pdf.

In view of the pending need for definitive elucidation of the source of primary human MERS-CoV infections, further research in bats, in addition to camels (and other animals), is prescribed. Such undertaking should cover, in addition to Saudi Arabia, other countries where locally acquired primary human infections have been recorded, such as Jordan, Qatar and United Arab Emirates.

The 1st human MERS-CoV cluster appeared in Jordan in April 2012 (Ref 4), prior to the disease 1st appearance in Saudi Arabia. According to the results of a serosurvey conducted in Jordan between June and September 2013, neutralising MERS-CoV antibodies were found in all (11) camel sera tested, while sera from goats and cattle tested negative (Ref 5). The "Egyptian tomb bat" is known to be one of the 25 bat species (8 families) included in the Chiroptera fauna of Jordan. The bat has been reportedly observed in the Jordan valley, in the vicinity of the Dead Sea. Tests in this bat species in Jordan deserve to be considered.

Sampling of material from this bat species could also be attempted on the western, Israeli side of the Jordan valley. According to information included in the 2013 annual report of Israel's Nature and Parks Authority on Insectivore Bats (published May 2014, in Hebrew, available at http://www.parks.org.il/ConservationAndheritage/Science/Documents/bat2013.pdf), there are 4 active colonies of _Taphozous perforatus_ in Israel, 3 of which were found in caves along the Jordan valley, one in a cave near Eilat. The largest, breeding cave (designated Q11) is situated near Kalia, on the northern shore of the Dead Sea, where 300-500 individuals have been sighted in the spring months of 2013. Would Israel's authorities consider sampling and testing these bats for MERS-CoV?

Jordan's camel population is reportedly 11 000 strong. Israel's camel population is estimated by knowledgeable sources at about 3000 to 3500, most of them in the Negev desert (south).
