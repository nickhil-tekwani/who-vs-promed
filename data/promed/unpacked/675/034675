Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, previously found in domestic rabbits at a private Utah farm, has now been found in wild rabbit populations in the state.

Not related to the COVID-19 virus that infects humans, the disease is highly contagious and causes rapid rabbit death, killing one to five days after exposure according to Utah's Division of Wildlife Resources [DWR]. Officials there want Utahn's to contact them if they see multiple dead wild rabbits in an area. The DWR's website contact page provides information about how to notify them at http://wildlife.utah.gov/about-us/contact-dwr.html.

Rabbit and pikas are susceptible to the disease. Symptoms include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, and difficulty breathing. Frothy blood comes from animal's noses just prior to death. It has an 80% to 100% fatality rate with no known cure or treatment.

Humans, dogs, and other animals are not susceptible to the virus, officially named RHDV-2, but can carry it from one location to another on feet or other contaminated items. The hardy virus can survive for months and can infect rabbits by direct contact to sick rabbits or through contact of sick rabbits' urine or feces.

"Always wear disposable gloves when handling a dead animal, and wash your hands thoroughly after," the DWR said. "Rabbit carcasses that are not fresh enough to be tested should be double bagged and disposed of by deep burial or landfill."

Those hunting cottontail or snowshoe rabbits are advised infected wild rabbits may not flee when approached. If the rabbit acts normally at the time of the hunt, it likely isn't affected.

"However, if you notice any discoloration or hemorrhages on internal organs after harvesting the rabbit, or if you see anything that may appear abnormal or a cause for concern, please contact your local DWR office."

If you suspect RHDV-2 in a domestic rabbit, contact your veterinarian or the State Veterinarian's office. For more information on RHDV-2 in domestic rabbits, visit the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food website (https://ag.utah.gov/farmers/animal-industry/).

The dead wild rabbits were found in the Teasdale area of Wayne County and tested at a lab. The domestic rabbit farm where the disease was tested for and detected was in Sanpete County. It was 1st identified in Europe where a vaccine is reportedly being developed.

Rabbits with the disease have now been found in California, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America.

RHD is characterized by high morbidity and high mortality (70%-90%) in European rabbits, and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea, and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (under 2 months old) and RHD-vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia.
