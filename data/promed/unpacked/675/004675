We have recently confirmed a case of acute Ross River fever in a Japanese traveler from Australia. There are no prior reports on Ross River fever in travelers in Japan.

The traveler, a 31 year old female, visited Melbourne [Victoria] between January to May 2013 and developed symptoms of Ross River fever on March 2013, with arthralgia and swelling in her ankle and knee. Her arthralgia subsequently worsened, and she was unable to walk. Her symptoms elevated [lessened?] in early May 2013, and she regained her ability to walk. She received further treatment for hand and finger arthralgia upon her return to Japan in May 2013. The traveler was positive for Ross River virus IgM and IgG antibody.

There has been an increase in the number of RRV disease cases in Australia in recent years (ProMED-mail posts 20120325.1079874 and 20120302.1059212). Although imported RRV cases are rare (Travel Med Infect Dis. 2012;10(3):129-34), no vaccine or therapeutics are available for the disease. Thus, it is important for travelers, medical practitioners, and public health authorities to be aware of the risk for RRV infection and take appropriate measures.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Tochitani and colleagues for sending in this report.

Interestingly, there have been no reports of cases Ross River virus infections in Victoria state this year [2013]. Dr Steve Berger reported on 20 Apr 2012: "For over 20 years, the highest incidence of Ross River disease has been reported in Queensland and New South Wales (highest disease rates per 100 000 in Northern Territory). In 2011, Victoria reported more cases than any other state" (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120421.1109313).

As Dr Tochitani and colleagues commented, it is important for health providers to be aware of the risk of infectious diseases in localities where their patients have been recently. Good travel histories are essential for assessing risk of infection.
