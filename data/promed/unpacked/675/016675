2 people showing symptoms of [avian influenza virus infection] have died in
the past week in Viet Nam, where the disease has already killed more than
40 people [41 - Mod.CP], a hospital official said on Saturday [29 Oct
2005]. "It's very, very clear that all the critical symptoms pointed to
bird flu," Dr Nguyen Ngoc Tai, the Director of the Vietnam-Cuba Hospital in
Dong Hoi, central Viet Nam, told Reuters.
The Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper quoted a report from the hospital in Quang
Binh province as saying the victims, a 14-year-old girl and a 26-year-old
man, had eaten duck and a chicken's egg around a week before they [became
ill]. The girl was admitted to hospital on 21 Oct 2005 and died on 23 Oct
2005, and the man died 26 Oct 2005 within an hour of arriving at the
hospital. Their bodies had been sent home to be buried, Tai said. He said
the victims were not related and from different towns in the province,
which is around 500 km (310 miles) south of the capital Hanoi. [The same]
newspaper quoted doctors at the hospital as saying that [both patients] had
severe respiratory problems, fever and lung infection -- symptoms similar
to bird flu.
Tai said a 3rd person with symptoms of the disease had been sent to a
better-equipped hospital in Hue City, central Viet Nam, for treatment.
"There is another case of a 27-year-old man who is suspected to have been
infected with bird flu but in a milder form," Tai said.
Tai said his hospital was ill equipped to treat bird flu patients and
called for immediate supplies of the antiviral drug Tamiflu and flu
vaccines to cope with the situation if more bird flu patients emerged. Most
human bird flu infections are due to handling birds sick with the virus or
contact with their droppings. Cooked meat is not a known source of infection.
The latest H5N1 outbreak first surfaced in Asia in late 2003. Since then,
62 people have died in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia and the
virus has spread to Europe's eastern border

[These are the first human cases of avian influenza to be reported from
Viet Nam since the end of August 2005.
It seems that the deaths of these 2 unrelated patients have been attributed
to avian H5N1 influenza virus infection on the basis of clinical assessment
alone, and that no laboratory testing has been undertaken, nor is likely to
be undertaken since the bodies of the patients have been returned to their
families. Therefore the status of these cases remains "suspected" and may
remain so. As of 24 Oct 2005, the total number of laboratory-confirmed
human cases of avian H5N1 influenza in Viet Nam since the beginning of the
outbreak in December 2003 remains 91, including 41 deaths. - Mod.CP]
