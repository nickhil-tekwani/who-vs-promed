Wisconsin State Veterinarian Bob Ehlenfeldt says tests on the swine
in the 2nd pseudorabies quarantine came back negative on Wednesday [2
May 2007]. "Those herds will be released from quarantine
immediately." Blood samples were drawn on Monday and Tuesday from
hogs on farms within 5 miles of an infected herd southeast of Loyal.
Two other herds outside the area that had purchased hogs from the
infected farm were also tested.
In all, 35 herds were tested in connection with the Loyal site;
earlier, 33 herds were tested in connection with the infected herd
west of Greenwood.
The 2 infected herds were destroyed last Friday; those premises must
be cleaned and then will be disinfected by Department of Agriculture
and USDA staff. Herds within 2 miles of the infected farms will be
retested in 30 to 60 days. If all tests are negative, the original
farms may repopulate.
Wisconsin should be able to retain its Stage-5 Pseudorabies-Free
status. No word yet as to whether Michigan and Kansas will remove
restrictions they recently place on Wisconsin hogs.

[It seems rather optimistic to forecast the state should retain its
Stage-5 Pseudorabies-Free status until the required testing 30-60
days later is complete. Also, it would seem appropriate to issue an
epidemiology report detailing where the disease came from. Was it
brought into the herd, indicating infection in some other herd, or
was it contact with wild hogs, in which case this then becomes a
transition herd for purposes of risk assessment.
Transition herds are those with some form of contact, generally nose
to nose through the fence with feral swine. - Mod.TG]
