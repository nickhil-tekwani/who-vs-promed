Imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) under CHP investigation
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [13 Apr 2014] investigating an imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a woman aged 85.

The patient, with underlying medical conditions, travelled to Dongguan from [4 to 5 Apr 2014] with her husband and younger brother. They lived at their relatives' home where their relatives have reared chickens. The patient also visited a wet market near their home there and helped in slaughtering chickens at home on [4 Apr 2014]. She returned to Hong Kong on [5 Apr 2014], and developed fever, cough with blood-stained sputum and shortness of breath since [11 Apr 2014]. She was sent to the Accident and Emergency Department of Tseung Kwan O Hospital (TKOH) by ambulance today and was subsequently admitted. She is currently managed under isolation and her condition is critical.

Her respiratory specimen was positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) virus upon preliminary laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch today [13 Apr 2014].

Initial investigation revealed that the patient had visited her husband at Haven of Hope Hospital (HHH) on [10 Apr 2014] who was admitted due to other illness. Her husband has remained asymptomatic so far and is currently under observation at HHH.

Apart from her husband, 7 other family members of the patient are also considered as close contacts. One of them had sore throat since [12 Apr 2014] and his condition is stable. The other close contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. These close contacts will be admitted to hospital for observation and their respiratory specimens will be taken for preliminary laboratory testing.

The CHP's investigations and tracing of other contacts are ongoing. The patient's brother who travelled to Dongguan with the patient, relevant healthcare workers, ambulance staff and patients who had stayed in the same cubicle with the patient's husband at HHH are being traced for exposure assessment and medical surveillance.

The CHP will liaise with the relevant Mainland health authority to follow up on the patient's contacts during her stay in the Mainland.

"The Serious Response Level under the Government's Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic remains activated and the CHP's follow-up actions are in full swing," a spokesman for the CHP remarked.

This is the 10th confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong. The CHP will notify the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Health and Family Planning Commission as well as health and quarantine authorities of Guangdong and Macau.

Locally, enhanced surveillance of suspected cases in public and private hospitals is underway. The CHP will continue to maintain liaison with the WHO, the Mainland and overseas health authorities to monitor the latest developments. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations.

Epidemiological investigation and follow-up actions by CHP on confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today [14 Apr 2014] provided an update on the 10th confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) affecting a woman aged 85.

"The epidemiological investigations, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures and health education against avian influenza are all ongoing," a spokesman for the DH said.

As of 4 pm, 8 close contacts and 52 other contacts had been identified.

Close contacts are the patient's family members. One of them was symptomatic and the others have remained asymptomatic so far. Preliminary laboratory testing of all of their respiratory specimens was negative for the influenza A virus. They remain hospitalised under observation.

Other contacts include the patient's brother who travelled to Dongguan with her, relevant health-care workers (HCWs), ambulance crew members and in-patients who stayed in the same cubicle with the patient's husband in Haven of Hope Hospital, as well as staff and patients in a private clinic in Po Lam, Tseung Kwan O, which she attended. Among them, an HCW reported influenza-like symptoms and preliminary testing of her specimen was negative for the influenza A virus. The others have remained asymptomatic. All of them remain under medical surveillance.

"In view of human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) confirmed locally and in the Mainland, further cases are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas. Those planning to travel outside Hong Kong should maintain good personal, environmental and food hygiene at all times," the spokesman urged.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[The number of cases of laboratory confirmed human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China continues to increase. As of yesterday, 14 Apr 2014, there were 407 cases reported. Zhejiang continues as the province reporting the most number of cases (138), with Guangdong now increasing in reported cases (102). As can be seen in the WHO update above, the majority of cases continue to have defined histories of exposure to poultry prior to onset of illness. Given the insidious nature of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAI), where infected avians are primarily asymptomatic, the presence of the LPAI A(H7N9) in domestic poultry stock in Mainland China, and the cultural practice of preferring to slaughter poultry immediately prior to preparing for consumption either through maintenance of backyard flocks or through "wet markets" (markets selling live poultry) in this situation is a continued recipe for transmission of the avian influenza A(H7N9) to humans in China - a significant challenge for the public health sector.
