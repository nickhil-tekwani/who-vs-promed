Commercial pigs in Indiana test positive for H1N1 flu
-----------------------------------------------------
The US Department of Agriculture says pigs in a commercial herd in Indiana
have tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus. This is the 1st instance of
H1N1 flu, also known as swine flu, in a commercial herd in the United States.

The USDA says it discovered 4 tissue samples that tested positive for the
virus using its swine surveillance program. The USDA says the pigs as well
as the people caring for the pigs have recovered. The sample was collected
in late October [2009].

Last month [October 2009], tests confirmed several show pigs at the
Minnesota State Fair contracted the virus.

5 more pigs found with H1N1 virus
---------------------------------
University study researching human-pig interaction looks to reduce flu spread.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed 5 more pigs from the
Minnesota and South Dakota [state fairs] with the H1N1 virus.

The infected pigs were tested as part of a study, "Swine Influenza at State
and County Fairs," proposed by Greg Gray, director of the Center for
Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa, to better
understand the spread of influenza in places where pigs and animals converge.

"The fair setting was investigated because during 2005 to 2008, the Center
for Disease Control and state and local health partners had identified a
number of sporadic cases of swine influenza infection where the infected
person had most likely been exposed at a fair or other public setting,"
said Jeff Bender, director of the International Cooperative Zoonotic
Influenza Research Center (ICZIRC) at the University of Minnesota, which is
funding the study.

The study began before the H1N1 pandemic arose, Bender said, and the
particular strain of the virus was not a focus of the study. Researchers
tested 50 pigs at the Minnesota State Fair in 2008, and 102 pigs at the
Minnesota and South Dakota state fairs in 2009. In addition to the 6 total
cases of H1N1, one pig was found to have H1N2, a strain of flu rarely found
in humans.

Although Gray said that the research team has not decided whether to
continue the study in 2010, the results could help pig farmers have a
better understanding of how to keep themselves and their herds healthy.
"It's important to know that these viruses move from man to pigs and back
again," Gray said. "They can mix with other viruses in man or pigs and out
can come new viruses that cause much more problems."

Right now, the research team is looking for evidence where the influenza
viruses cross over between species so they can make recommendations for how
to reduce flu transmission. This involves documenting virus transmissions,
determining risk factors and testing methods of intervention. In the
meantime, they are advocating for pig farmers and veterinarians to be
short-listed for the H1N1 vaccine.

"Swine veterinarians are important in reducing this problem and we have to
protect them like we protect workers in hospitals," Gray said. Gray also
recommends people working with swine receive the seasonal flu vaccine and
educate themselves in biosecurity measures. Limiting human contact with
pigs, especially in cases of sick humans, and using protective equipment
can reduce disease transmission.

The pigs were not tracked after testing and the researchers could not
comment on what happened to the infected pigs. The H1N1 virus continues to
threaten humans more than pigs, Gray said.

The University of Minnesota's ICZIRC houses 6 other studies investigating
influenza viruses and their effects on human health. The center was
established because of increasing interactions among humans, livestock,
poultry, and wildlife that have resulted in the emergence of zoonotic diseases.
