First West Nile Virus-associated Death in South Texas
-----------------------------------------------------
The death of a Nueces County man in October 2002 was the first in South
Texas to be linked to West Nile virus, health officials said on Thu 5 Dec
2002. At the time, state health officials believed the man, who was in his
80s, had St. Louis encephalitis, [caused by] a virus that has similar
symptoms, said Jim Schuermann, an epidemiologist with the Texas Department
of Health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did further
testing and confirmed West Nile virus infection to Corpus Christi officials
on Thu 5 Dec 2002.
Texas has confirmed 181 human cases of West Nile virus infection this year,
which included 10 deaths, Schuermann said. A total of 35 Texas counties
have confirmed human cases, most of which have been in and around Harris
County, Schuermann said. The Corpus Christi death was the second human case
in Nueces County, Assistant City Manager Jorge G. Cruz-Aedo said. He said
the man was admitted to a hospital with symptoms that were mistaken for St.
Louis encephalitis, but he also had suffered from diabetes and cancer.
In an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus this summer, city workers
sprayed for adult insects and larvae for up to 14 hours a day in July and
August 2002. Nationwide, 3775 human cases of West Nile have been confirmed;
218 have died, according to the CDC. Schuermann said people exposed to the
virus would likely develop a resistance to it. "We think it's lifetime
immunity," he said.

30 000 Pints of Plasma Quarantined
----------------------------------
Blood banks are quarantining all plasma frozen during the West Nile virus
epidemic -- an estimated 30 000 pints -- to reduce further the low risk of
spreading the disease through blood products. West Nile virus is spread
mostly by infected mosquitoes, but federal health officials discovered in
September 2002 that it also occasionally is spread through donated blood or
organs. Of the more than 3800 West Nile cases this year, about 13 are
believed to have been caused by a blood transfusion. Most donated blood --
the red blood cells and platelets -- is used right away. The government had
tried to limit the West Nile virus risk by warning blood banks earlier this
fall not to accept donations from people with West Nile fever-like symptoms.
But plasma, the liquid part of blood, is routinely frozen and thus can be
used up to a year later. It's needed mostly by people with advanced liver
disease and to treat serious trauma. So large hospitals in states that were
hard hit by the West Nile fever epidemic may face temporary tight supplies,
as blood banks race to replace quarantined plasma with plasma donated in
West Nile virus-free states or after the epidemic ended.
The American Association of Blood Banks and the nation's 2 major blood
suppliers -- the American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers --
announced the move on Thu 12 Dec 2002. Included in the quarantine are
frozen blood products that were collected anywhere from a week before each
state's first case of West Nile virus, through a week after the last case.
That means that how much frozen plasma is quarantined will differ greatly
from state to state, depending on how many West Nile cases each had.
Will there be serious shortages? "Nobody really knows," said Dr. Steven
Kleinman of the AABB, who said next week will be the crucial period. But he
said if hospitals have emergencies to treat and only quarantined plasma on
the shelf, they should use it -- but try to use bags dated near the
beginning or end of their region's West Nile outbreak, when the risk of
donations by sick people would have been lower.
During the holidays, blood banks always need more donations, particularly
of red blood cells, which make up most lifesaving transfusions. But
officials are hopeful of replacing the quarantined plasma fairly quickly.
The quarantined amount makes up only about 15 percent of the Red Cross'
frozen inventory, said medical officer Dr. Peter Page. "The problem is
worst today. It'll only get better in coming weeks," as shipments of
pre-West Nile frozen bags go out and new blood donations come in, he said.
The quarantine was a voluntary decision by the blood industry, but the Food
and Drug Administration, which regulates blood safety, called it a logical
move considering hospital freezers still harbored plasma that might contain
some West Nile virus. Yet the quarantine couldn't have come earlier,
because until winter ended the epidemic in the South, there was no way to
replace the supply, noted FDA blood chief Dr. Jay Epstein.

First West Nile Virus Human Fatality in Florida
-----------------------------------------------
The first person to die in Florida after contracting West Nile virus was a
74-year-old Marion County man who died on Sun 9 Dec 2002, the Health
Department announced on Thu 12 Dec 2002. The man, a retired Scout executive
for the Boy Scouts of America, was aged 74, of Ocala.
County Health Department Director Dr. Nate Grossman said the West Nile
patient died from complications of encephalitis, or swelling of the brain,
at a local hospital. He had been hospitalized for about 4 weeks. Grosman
said he encourages residents to keep up their guard against mosquito bites.
"The advice remains the same -- keep following the personal protective
measures," he said. "Although the weather has gotten cool, it hasn't gotten
cold enough to kill the mosquitoes. The chances of being bit by a mosquito
are less, but not zero."
This was the third human case of West Nile virus infection in Marion County
and the state's 27th this year, said Rob Hayes, Department of Health
spokesman. Marion County has been under medical alert for West Nile virus
since 13 Aug 2002. Statewide, 39 counties are under the medical alert.
In the United States so far this year, 225 people have died from the virus,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It has also
affected animals. Terry McElroy of the Florida Department of Agriculture
and Consumer Services said 476 Florida horses tested positive for the virus
this year and 25 have died.

Intrauterine Transmission of West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------------
A month-old baby with West Nile virus [contracted infection] before she was
born in the country's first documented intrauterine transmission of the
disease, according to a report. The case surprised health officials who had
believed the disease could not be passed from pregnant mothers to their
unborn children, the Post-Standard of Syracuse reported on Thu 19 Dec 2002.
The 20-year-old mother, a resident of this central New York city, was
admitted to a hospital on 29 Aug 2002 with fever, headaches, blurred vision
and other symptoms that weren't attributed to West Nile virus infection.
She was released a week later, but diagnosed [West Nile virus-positive]
when she was readmitted on 24 Sep 2002, the paper reported. The woman gave
birth at full-term in November 2002, and tests on her daughter's spinal
fluid and umbilical cord blood showed West Nile infection, said Dr. Lloyd
Novick, Onondaga County health commissioner. The baby has a number of
health complications, he told the paper. The baby's life is not in danger,
but the virus or its complications may have caused problems affecting the
infant's central nervous system, according to county health officials.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site
as of Wed 18 Dec 2002, there was no evidence that West Nile virus can be
transmitted during pregnancy or birth. The CDC has documented 6 cases of
West Nile virus infection in pregnant women. None of the women or children
died. A case of West Nile virus infection in a Michigan infant was
attributed to breast-feeding from the mother, who was infected with the
virus through a blood transfusion shortly after giving birth, according to
the CDC.
"We're not recommending screening of pregnant mothers," said Novick, whose
department reported the Syracuse case to the CDC. "But since this is the
first time this has happened, people have to be clinically aware of the
possibility in the future."

Intrauterine West Nile Virus Infection; New York, 2002
------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus and human neuropathogen,
is epidemic in the United States (1). In 2002, newly recognized mechanisms
of person-to-person WNV transmission were described, including possible
transmission from mother to infant through breast milk (2,3). WNV has not
been previously associated with intrauterine infection or adverse birth
outcomes. This report describes a case of transplacental WNV transmission.
Pregnant women should take precautions to reduce their risk for WNV or
other arboviral infection and should undergo diagnostic testing when
clinically appropriate.
On 29 Aug 2002, a previously healthy woman aged 20 years in the estimated
27th week of pregnancy was admitted to a New York hospital with a 2-day
history of fever, severe headache, blurred vision, abdominal and back pain,
and vomiting. On examination, she had a fever of 102.7 F (39.3 C); the
fetal heart rate was elevated. A computerized tomographic scan of the
patient's head, a fetal sonogram, and routine analyses of blood and
amniocentesis fluid were normal. A urine culture grew _Proteus mirabilis_
and _Escherichia coli_. Intravenous antibiotics were administered. The
fever had resolved 4 days after admission, and the patient had pain and
weakness of the legs. Neurologic examination indicated symmetric weakness
of the legs and hyporeflexia of the legs and arms. No cranial nerve
abnormalities were noted. Electromyelography (EMG) was not completed. On 14
Sep 2002, despite persistent lower extremity paresis, she left the hospital
against medical advice. On 16 Sep 2002, the patient was readmitted
following a fall. She was afebrile, but physical examination revealed
weakness in both legs. Fetal monitoring results were normal. Serum was
positive for IgG antibodies to rubella virus and herpes simplex virus
(HSV), and laboratory tests showed no evidence of syphilis or infection
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Serum also was positive for
flavivirus IgM and IgG by immunofluorescence assay. Additional serum and
CSF specimens were obtained during the week ending 12 Oct 2002. Serum was
positive for WNV-specific IgM antibodies. CSF analysis indicated
lymphocytic pleocytosis (11 white blood cells/mm3, 87 percent lymphocytes,
8 percent monocytes, and 5 percent neutrophils), elevated protein (63
mg/dL), and the presence of WNV-specific IgM antibodies. Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) tests of CSF for WNV, enterovirus (EV), and HSV were
negative. EMG studies indicated widespread involvement of the lower motor
neurons or their proximal axons, with the legs affected more severely than
the arms. A diagnosis of meningoencephalitis was made.
Approximately 5 weeks later, the patient delivered a live infant (estimated
gestational age: 38 weeks). Serum obtained from the mother at the time of
birth was positive for WNV-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. The
infant's birth weight and general clinical examination were normal. An
ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral chorioretinitis, and MRI of
the brain indicated severe cerebral abnormalities, including severe
bilateral white-matter loss in the temporal and occipital lobes and cystic
change in one temporal lobe consistent with focal cerebral destruction.
Cord blood and infant heel-stick blood samples were positive for
WNV-specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. CSF was WNV-specific IgM
antibody-positive but was contaminated with red blood cells. The presence
of WNV-specific IgM antibody in the infant's serum and CSF confirmed
intrauterine infection with WNV. Serum was cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM
antibody-negative but IgG-positive, and serologic tests were negative for
lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection and toxoplasmosis. PCR tests
of CSF for WNV, EV, and HSV were negative. Urine CMV culture was negative.
Gross and histopathologic examinations of the placenta, umbilical cord, and
amniotic membranes were normal. The placenta was WNV PCR-positive at one of
2 reference laboratories. The umbilical cord tissue was WNV-positive and
equivocal by PCR, respectively, at the same 2 laboratories. Viral cultures
of umbilical cord tissue were negative; viral cultures of CSF and placenta
are pending.

MMWR Editorial Note:
On the basis of the presence of WNV-specific IgM in the mother and infant,
this is the first report of transplacental transmission of WNV in humans.
Intrauterine infections with Japanese encephalitis virus and dengue virus,
2 mosquito-borne flaviviruses closely related to WNV, have been associated
with spontaneous abortion and severe dengue fever in the infant,
respectively (4 to 7). Although the single case reported here demonstrates
intrauterine WNV infection in an infant who had evidence of congenital
abnormalities, it does not prove a causal relation between such an
infection and these abnormalities.
Pregnant women should take precautions to reduce their risk for WNV and
other arboviral infections by avoiding mosquitoes and by using protective
clothing and repellents containing N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) per
manufacturers' directions. When WNV transmission is occurring in an area,
pregnant women who have an illness that is clinically consistent with acute
WNV infection should undergo appropriate diagnostic testing. Screening of
asymptomatic pregnant women or newborns for evidence of WNV infection is
not recommended because no specific treatment for this infection is
available, and because WNV IgM antibody might persist for more than a year,
tests of a single serum sample cannot accurately determine the timing of
infection (8). CDC has initiated a voluntary registry to monitor birth
outcomes among WNV-infected women. In the event of an adverse birth
outcome, maternal and fetal or newborn samples should be submitted to a
state public health laboratory or CDC for testing.

Provisional Surveillance Summary of the West Nile Virus Epidemic; United
States, Jan to Nov 2002
-------------------------------------------------
This report presents provisional summary surveillance data about West Nile
virus (WNV) activity that were reported to CDC during the period 1 Jan to
30 Nov 2002, through the ArboNET surveillance network. In 2002, the
reported numbers of human and animal infections increased, and the
geographic range of WNV activity expanded substantially. These data
underscore the need for intensive surveillance to detect and quantify WNV
activity in areas where humans are at risk, public education to teach
persons how to prevent mosquito bites, and sustained and integrated
mosquito-control activities.
ArboNET is a web-based surveillance data network comprising 54 state and
local public health departments and CDC. Specimens from ill humans and
animals, dead birds, captive sentinel animals (mostly chickens),
wild-caught birds, and mosquitoes were collected by state and local public
health departments and other cooperating state and federal agencies and
tested for WNV or WNV-specific antibody. Test results, the county and date
of specimen collection or illness onset, and other data were entered into
state and local public health department databases. Animal data were
forwarded regularly to ArboNET through a secure data network; human cases
were reported to CDC by telephone or facsimile only.
In 2002, WNV activity was reported from 2289 counties in 44 states and the
District of Columbia (DC) compared with 359 counties in 27 states and DC in
2001 (1), and WNV virus was detected for the first time in 1929 U.S.
counties and 16 states. In 2002, a total of 3389 human cases of WNV disease
were reported, compared with 149 during 1999 to 2001, and large numbers of
WNV-infected birds, equines, and mosquitoes also were reported.
Human Surveillance:
In 2002, of the 3389 reported cases of human WNV-associated illness, 2354
(69 percent) persons had West Nile meningoencephalitis (WNME), 704 (21
percent) had West Nile fever (WNF), and 331 (10 percent) had an unspecified
illness. Human cases were reported from 619 counties in 37 states and DC; 5
states (Illinois [774 cases], Michigan [475], Ohio [409], Louisiana [319],
and Indiana [202]) accounted for 2179 (64 percent) cases. 4 of these 5
states (Illinois [492], Michigan [437], Ohio [277], and Louisiana [202])
together with Texas [164] accounted for 1572 (67 percent) reported WNME
cases. Illness onset dates ranged from 10 Jun to 4 Nov 2002, and the
epidemic peak of WNME cases occurred during the week ending 24 Aug 2002.
Illness onset dates ranged from 10 Jun to 4 Nov 2002 in southern states and
from 10 Jul to 28 Oct 2002 in northern states [see below for definitions of
northern and southern states]. The epidemic peak of WNME cases occurred one
week earlier in southern states (88 cases during the week ending 17 Aug
2002) than in northern states (317 cases during the week ending 24 aug
2002). For all reported human cases, the median age of infected persons was
55 years (range: 1 month to 99 years); for persons with WNME, the median
age was 59 years (range: 1 month to 99 years); and for persons with WNF,
the median age was 48 years (range: 1 to 93 years). Of the 2354 persons
with WNME, 199 (9 percent) died; 2 (0.3 percent) of 704 persons with WNF
died; both were age >80 years. The median age of the 201 decedents was 78
years (range: 24 to 99 years).
Animal Surveillance:
Of 2289 counties reporting WNV activity, 1719 (75 percent) counties in 42
states and DC reported 14 122 dead WNV-infected birds (7719 crows, 4948
blue jays, and 1455 birds of 92 other species). Infected birds were
collected from 10 Jan to 7 Nov 2002, and the peak number of infected birds
occurred during the week ending 10 Aug 2002. Of 10 036 tested dead crows,
7719 (77 percent) were WNV-positive compared with 6403 (40 percent) of 16
132 birds from other species.
In 2002, a total of 9144 (99.9 percent) of 9157 reported nonhuman mammal
cases occurred in equines, and 13 occurred in other species (dogs [3],
squirrels [8], and unspecified species [2]). Cases were reported from 1374
counties in 38 states, with illness onset dates ranging from 3 Jan to 8 Nov
2002. 6 states (Illinois [1116 cases], Texas [1050], Minnesota [945],
Indiana [704], Kansas [675], and South Dakota [653]) accounted for 56
percent of reported nonhuman mammal cases.
A limited number of counties and states tested mosquitoes (639 counties in
37 states and DC), wild-caught birds (65 counties in 8 states), and
sentinel chickens (92 counties in 8 states) as part of WNV surveillance. In
2002, approximately 1.3 million mosquitoes of 88 species were tested. WNV
was detected in 4943 pools (representing 26 species) from 315 counties in
28 states and DC. _Culex_ mosquitoes (_Cx. pipiens_, _Cx. restuans_, _Cx.
salinarius_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and _Cx. tarsalis_) accounted for 2717
(55 percent) WNV-positive pools. WNV was reported for the first time in 7
mosquito species (_Aedes aegypti_, _Anopheles walkeri_, _Cx. erraticus_,
_Cx. tarsalis_, _Cx. territans_, _Culiseta inornata_, and _Psorophora
ciliata_). Since 1999, a total of 36 WNV-infected mosquito species have
been reported to ArboNET. In 2002, a total of 144 seropositive wild-caught
birds were reported from 25 counties in 4 states (Indiana, Kansas,
Louisiana, and Ohio), and 366 sero-converting captive sentinel birds were
reported from 47 counties in 7 states (Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, New York,
North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas).
First Indicators of WNV Activity;
Among 2289 counties reporting WNV activity in 2002, the first indicator of
activity was a WNV-infected dead bird in 1420 (62 percent) counties, an
equine case in 660 (29 percent) counties, a human case in 84 (4 percent)
counties, a sero-converting sentinel bird in 18 (0.8 percent) counties, an
infected mosquito pool in 77 (3 percent) counties, and a seropositive
wild-caught bird in 6 (0.2 percent) counties. In 24 counties, WNV activity
was first detected on the same date by at least 2 surveillance mechanisms.
In 531 (86 percent) of 619 counties reporting human cases, the first human
illness onset was preceded by reports of a dead WNV-infected bird, infected
equine, sero-converting sentinel chicken, or infected mosquito pool by a
median of 33 days (range: 1 to 252 days). Of the 2289 counties with WNV
activity, 1670 (73 percent) counties detected enzootic WNV activity but no
human infections.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The 2002 WNV epidemic in the United States was the largest arboviral
meningoencephalitis epidemic documented in the western hemisphere and the
largest reported WNME epidemic. Epizootic and epidemic activity was most
intense in the central United States, especially the Great Lakes region,
and extended to the west coast. One human case reported in a Los Angeles
County, California, resident with no known travel history (and with no
other WNV activity found statewide) and a report of a WNV-infected horse in
Island County, Washington, indicate the complete transcontinental movement
of WNV within 3 years. In 2002, Canadian health authorities also documented
WNV activity in 5 provinces (Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Quebec, and
Saskatchewan) (2). The 2002 WNV epidemic included the first documented
cases of person-to-person WNV transmission through organ transplantation,
blood and blood product transfusion, and possibly breast-feeding (3,4).
Also in 2002, intrauterine infection was reported (5), and a
poliomyelitis-like syndrome was first recognized in the United States among
some WNME patients with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) (6).
Nationally, the epidemic peak of human WNV-associated illness during 2002
occurred in late August; human cases in southern states preceded those in
northern states by approximately 1 month. In 2002, human cases also were
reported from the New York City metropolitan area for the fourth
consecutive year. This prolonged and continued widespread transmission to
humans, including in areas of previous epidemic activity, underscores the
importance of maintaining human surveillance programs from early June
through November and the need to consider WNV disease in the differential
diagnosis of encephalitis, meningitis, AFP, and nonspecific febrile illness
before and after the late summer months in which arboviral outbreaks
traditionally occur.
The 2002 WNV epidemic is similar to the 1975 St. Louis encephalitis (SLE)
epidemic, which produced approximately 2100 reported human illnesses and
170 fatalities (case-fatality ratio: 8 percent), primarily in the
Mississippi and Ohio River basins (7). WNV and SLE virus are closely
related; both are transmitted primarily by _Culex_ mosquitoes and amplified
in birds. However, SLE virus is not an avian or equine pathogen.
In 2002, the proportion of human cases reported with WNF was greater than
in previous years. This change probably reflects increased testing and
diagnosis of WNV infection in persons with milder illness. WNF patients
tend to be younger than patients with WNME (8). The somewhat lower median
age among persons with WNME reported in 2002 compared with those reported
during 1999 to 2001 (59 years versus 66 years) could reflect the incorrect
classification of some WNF cases as WNME cases. The median age among
persons with fatal WNME reported in 2002 was similar to that in previous
years. Although older persons are at higher risk for WNME and death,
persons of any age might develop severe neurologic disease.
Bird- and horse-based surveillance are important tools for monitoring the
geographic spread of WNV and for signaling WNV activity in an area before
the recognition of human illnesses. The number of counties reporting
WNV-infected dead birds in 2002 was 5 times greater than that in 2001, and
the number of reported WNV-infected dead birds doubled (1). In 2002, crows,
blue jays, and other members of the family _Corvidae_ accounted for 90
percent of WNV-infected birds, and crows had the highest rate of WNV
infection. State and local health department surveillance programs should
continue to emphasize the collection and testing of dead corvids. Because
non-corvid bird species were the first indicator of WNV activity in 144 (6
percent) counties, surveillance programs should include these species when
possible.
From 2001 to 2002, equine cases reported to ArboNET increased 12-fold, and
equine transmission occurred over a longer season and in 9 new states (1).
In 2002, the geographic and temporal distribution of equine cases closely
paralleled the human epidemic in the midwestern and north-central states,
suggesting that horses, although unlikely to contribute to the transmission
cycle for WNV (9), might be useful indicators of increased human risk in
those areas.
The 3 _Culex_ species that produced the most WNV-positive pools during
2002, _Cx. pipiens_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, and _Cx. restuans_, are among
the most important WNV epizootic or epidemic vectors in the United States.
During 1999 to 2002, an additional 33 mosquito species also were found
infected with WNV. These include _Cx. nigripalpus_, the principal epidemic
vector of SLE in Florida, and _Cx. tarsalis_, an important vector of SLE
and western equine encephalitis in the western states. Although other
species (e.g., _Ochlerotatus triseriatus_, _Ae. albopictus_, _Ae. aegypti_)
might contribute to human WNV transmission, control of _Culex_ mosquitoes
continues to be the most important strategy to reduce the risk for WNV
transmission to humans.
The ArboNET data summarized in this report probably underestimate the
actual geographic distribution and intensity of WNV virus transmission in
the United States for at least 3 reasons. First, although dead bird
surveillance is important in monitoring WNV activity, only 27 percent of
reported dead birds in 2002 were submitted for testing, compared with 50
percent in 2001. Many state and local health departments were overwhelmed
by the large numbers of samples submitted for WNV testing and discontinued
dead bird testing during the transmission season. Second, because data
provided by the 54 ArboNET coordinators are derived primarily from local
health unit surveillance efforts, which vary according to local capacity
and priorities, some animal and human surveillance data might not yet be
reported and confirmed. Finally, states might vary in their interpretation
of and adherence to the national surveillance case definition of arboviral
encephalitis/meningitis, and no standard national case definition for WNF
exists.
The epidemic of 2002 underscores the continued need for intensive ecologic
surveillance to detect early-season WNV activity. To decrease the risk for
human WNV infection, the coordinated and phased public health response to
detection of WNV activity in an area should include intensified
mosquito-control activities that reduce the avian-mosquito amplification
cycle. Prevention activities should continue to include 1) public education
programs urging residential source reduction and personal protective
measures to reduce mosquito exposure; 2) development of long-term,
community-level, integrated mosquito surveillance and control programs
(10); and 3) high-priority emphasis on the control of Culex mosquitoes,
especially in urban and suburban areas.
