An outbreak of hepatitis E has claimed the lives of at least 50 people in
remote villages of eastern Chad. The medical centre in Kerfi is the only
one in a 50-km radius.

In one village alone, scores of people have already died. Aid workers in
the region are trying to help, but there are problems with access. The
village of Kerfi, 80 km from the Sudanese border, is very difficult to get
to. There are few roads and during the rainy season floodwaters create huge
seasonal rivers, called wadis. The only way to reach the village of Kerfi
is to cross the deep, muddy ring of water. Vital medical supplies have to
be floated across the wadi on rafts.

Even though the hepatitis outbreak is slowing down there, more than 50
people in this area near the town of Goz Beida have already lost their
lives. Doctor Camilo Kuan, who has been treating hepatitis patients at the
village clinic, says there still are not enough medical facilities in this
remote corner of Chad. "The medical centre in Kerfi is the only one for 50
kilometres and people can't reach it," Dr Kuan says. "There aren't any
boats, there aren't horses which can cross the wadis -- people have to
swim. So if people are ill they stay at home."

Hepatitis E may not be a headline-grabbing disease like Ebola or HIV/AIDS,
but it can still be deadly. There is no vaccine for the disease, and there
is also no cure.

Souleymane Diabate of UNICEF says that one of the most frustrating aspects
of the disease is how simple it is to prevent - clean drinking water and
good hygiene practices are all that are needed. "It's mainly due to the
fact that most of the localities around Goz Beida don't have drinking
water, the sanitation is really poor and the practice of hygiene also
doesn't exist," she says. "So most of the people are going to the river to
fetch water for consumption. So, most of the population suffer from this
disease."

As [this reporter] learnt from the medical staff here [the village of Goz
Beida], 15 other villages are also suffering from the outbreak of hepatitis
E. The hope now is that supplies get to them before it is too late for even
more people.

[Hepatitis E is an important public health concern in many developing
countries. Hepatitis E is caused by a small single-stranded RNA
calicivirus-like enteric virus now classified as the separate genus
_Hepevivirus_. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and
is associated with fecal contamination of water supplies. The hepatitis E
mortality rate can reach 25 percent in pregnant women in deprived
communities, but is generally much lower. Although hepatitis E disease only
occurs rarely in countries with good health-care systems, the
seroprevalence rate in healthy individuals can be high.

Hepatitis E disease can be controlled to a large extent by provision of
clean water and adequate sewage treatment facilities. However, there is
increasing evidence that hepatitis E virus is also a zoonotic agent and
that animal reservoirs may exist. Many species of domestic and wild animals
have anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies, and animal hepatitis E viruses
closely related to human hepatitis E viruses have been isolated. Avian
hepatitis E viruses appear to be less closely related to human viruses.
Swine may be an important reservoir of the virus, as pig handlers and
veterinarians appear to be at greater risk of infection, as indicated by
higher antibody levels. Furthermore, cases of acute hepatitis E have
occurred in Japan in association with consumption of raw pig and wild boar
meat.

Lack of an efficient cell culture system has impeded the development of
vaccines and therapeutic agents. - Mod.CP]
