Cholera has killed 43 people in the last 2 weeks along the remote
border between Kenya and Somalia, officials in both nations said on
Friday [29 Feb 2008].

Abubakar Abdi, a public health official in Kenya's Mandera District
[in the North Eastern Province of Kenya, bordering Somalia -
CopyEd.MJ], said 30 people, including at least 6 children, had died
there from the water-borne disease in a fortnight [14 days]. Meat
exports to Somalia and Ethiopia were banned, he said.

On the Somali side of the border, a staff member with the Irish
charity Trocaire said 13 people had died from 676 suspected cases,
257 of which had needed hospital treatment.

[2] Cholera - Somalia (Gedo)

About 70 people have died in a severe outbreak of cholera in southern
Somalia, close to the Kenyan border town of Mandera, reports say. At
least 400 people have been affected and drought conditions are
aggravating the problem.

People affected on the Kenyan side of the border are getting medical
aid but almost none is available in Somalia, says the BBC's reporter
in the region. Local non-government organisations have appealed for
international help.

The crisis is affecting Somalia's Gedo region, where people interact
with their Kenyan neighbors across the border in Mandera, the BBC's
Bashkash Jugsodaay says.

Health personnel are helping sufferers on the Kenyan side and
spreading information about how the illness can be contracted from
dirty water. However, in Gedo, the lack of medical facilities is
making the situation unbearable, our reporter says. The handful of
NGOs in the area are unable to provide enough support and fear the
situation might get out of control, he adds.

The cholera situation in Mwense district of Luapula Province is under
control. No new patients have been recorded since 15 Feb 2008. Lusaka
District continues to report cases of cholera in high-density
settlements (Chipata Overspill, Chaisa, George (Zone 3), and Matero).
Cumulatively 71 patients have been treated for cholera in Lusaka in
the last 30 days; no deaths have been recorded. In Kitwe district
(Copperbelt Province), 35 cases of watery diarrhea have been recorded
with 6 confirmed as cholera.

UNICEF is responding to all 3 cholera zones by supporting MOH
(Ministry of Health) assessments and providing zinc tablets,
ciprofloxacilin, sodium lactate, glucose hyperton, ORS (oral
rehydration solution), cannulas, and latex examination gloves to
District Epidemic Preparedness Committees.

Although heavy rains are forecast until end March [2008] in the
northern part of Zambia, floodwaters are receding in the Southern
parts of the country, raising the risk of disease outbreaks,
diarrhea, cholera, and malaria, especially from highly contaminated
water sources and standing water.

[5] Diarrhea, fatal - Philippines (Eastern Samar)

<http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20080224-120891/Diarrhea-cases-surge-in-flood-hit-Eastern-Samar>


At least 178 persons from the flooded city and towns of Eastern Samar
were reported to be suffering from diarrhea, according to reports
collated by the Office of Civil Defense in Eastern Visayas. The death
toll due to flooding reached 18, the report released on Sunday [24
Feb 2008] said.

The city of Borongan and the towns of Maydolong and Dolores, the
report said, had the highest number of fatalities with 3 each. The
rest of the dead were from the towns of Jipapad, Gen. MacArthur,
Taft, Can-avid, San Julian, all in Eastern Samar; Pinabacdao in
Samar; Dulag and Palo, both in Leyte; and Culaba in Biliran. The
death toll is expected to climb as more reports from affected towns
are received, said operation chief Rey Gozon.

As flooding spawned by the relentless rain continued, diarrhea cases
also rose, said Gozon. He said that diarrhea cases were detected in
practically all localities in Eastern Samar, with Borongan City
having 38 people afflicted with diarrhea, the highest number of cases
among all areas in the province. The other towns in the province,
which had double-digit cases of diarrhea were Can-avid, 15; Llorente,
14; Guiuan, 14; Balangkayan, 13; and Taft, 10.

[What appears to be a high case fatality rate, for instance, 3 of 38
in the capital Borongan City suggests cholera as an etiology.

The province of Eastern Samar lies on Samar Island, the largest
island in the Visayas (all the islands in the middle of the
Philippine archipelago between Luzon to the north and Mindanao to the
south). The island is divided into 3 provinces: Samar (previously
Western Samar), Northern Samar, and Eastern Samar. Together with the
provinces Leyte, Southern Leyte, and Biliran they form the region
known as the Eastern Visayas. They can be found on a map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Samar>.
