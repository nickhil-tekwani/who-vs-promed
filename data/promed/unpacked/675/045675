This is a belated response to the query raised by David Waltner-Toews as to
published information on whether disinsectization of aircraft really works.
In 1930, Ray Shannon, an entomologist with the Yellow Fever Service,
reported
detecting the presence in Natal, Brazil, of _Anopheles gambiae_, a highly
efficient vector of malaria in Africa. No action was taken against the
invader, and the next year, 1931, witnessed a large outbreak of malaria in
Natal; prompt action was taken, and the disease disappeared, never to
return.
No further action was taken, and there ensued a period of
quiescence from 1932 to 1937, when _A. gambiae_ spread over the Northeastern
states of Ceara, Rio Grande do Sul and Pernambuco. In 1937, malaria
exploded over the entire area. Brazilians, accustomed to seeing the annual
outbreaks of endemic malaria, were terrified by what they considered a
horrible new disease from Africa -- this was epidemic malaria, with an
incredible morbidity and an appalling mortality rate. In 1939, the
Malaria Service of The Northeast was established as a collaborative effort
by The Rockefeller Foundation and the Ministry of Health of Brazil. A
terrestrial line of demarcation was established, along which mosquito
breeding loci were destroyed and the line was inexorably pushed toward the
sea.
Concurrently, all marine and air traffic
into the Northeast along the entire littoral, from San Salvador de Bahia
(State of Bahia) to Belem do Para on the Amazon River, was subjected to
spraying to deny the mosquito re-entry into the country. The result? What
had begun as a vaunted eradication program, deemed impossible according to
conventional wisdom, came out a total success -- in less than two years a
vicious carrier of malaria was totally eradicated, and the Malaria Service
was disbanded. Two subsequent years of close surveillance yielded no
evidence that _A. gambiae_ had survived or returned.
The story of this classic war is provided by two eminent participants in
the book: "Anopheles Gambiae in Brazil, 1930 to 1940" by Fred L.Soper &
D. Bruce Wilson, The Rockefeller Foundation, 1943.

Leaving aside the issue of the efficacy -- or lack thereof -- of spraying
aircraft, am I missing something here re. passengers' RIGHTS? At least to
be informed? Do airlines not have any legal obligation to inform would-be
passengers of their practices, so that those who object can take their
business elsewhere?

The text on Aircraft Disinsection Requirements (West Nile-like virus,
aircraft spraying (03) 991025230628) lists South Africa as mandating cabin
spraying for planes coming from areas infected with malaria or yellow fever.
That is probably why, last August [1999, the SAA [South African Airways
plane I was in, arriving from Sao Paulo city (actually, nearby Guarulhos)
was duly sprayed. This is perhaps funny, since Sao Paulo city is not -- and
has never been -- an area of occurrence of either disease.
Bureaucratic execution of technical directives can indeed be funny:
during my stay in Africa, I had occasion to arrive at the same South
African airport (Johannesburg) thrice: arriving from Kenya, from
Namibia, and from Zimbabwe. In none of these instances was the plane
sprayed.

[Ah but, Celso, maybe the S. Africans knew that your plane had originated in
Rio, where we see cases of malaria in the big university hospital a stoneÂ´s
throw from the airport every week, and where there were huge epidemics of
yellow fever earlier in this century and yellow fever mosquitoes are all
over the place today! - Mod.JW
