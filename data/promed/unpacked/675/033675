We thank proMED for the opportunity to make a few corrections to the post (Herpesvirus, zoo elephant - Switzerland: (ZH), archive number: 20220712.8704381) and add some information for your readers.

Asian and African elephants get different subtypes of the EEHV: Asian elephants typically get EEHV1, EEHV4, and EEHV5, while African elephants typically get EEHV2, EEHV3, EEHV6, and EEHV7. These subtypes have most likely co-evolved with their elephant species over millions of years. It is not thought that EEHV1 in Asian elephants is due to a cross-over from African elephants.

The original finding of EEHV1 in a few African elephant samples has not been repeated and was most likely due to laboratory contamination. Both Asian and African elephants can get EEHV Hemorrhagic Disease (EEHV-HD).
