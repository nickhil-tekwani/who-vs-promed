The [African] swine fever is being tackled by the Moldovan authorities, after 2 foci of infection have been discovered in the north of the country.

Agriculture Minister Eduard Grama has told today [29 Sep 2016] a news conference it matters to make the people aware of the disease: "We do have problems with the [African] swine fever. Several slaughterhouses have been quarantined since spring."

Food Safety Agency ANSA deputy director Vsevolod Stamati: "We notified the Government at once about the 58 outbreaks in Ukraine. In Moldova, 10 pigs were infected, 8 died and 2 were shot dead. We sent the samples to Spain, and we expect the results tomorrow.

"The disease was brought to Moldova on St Mary Day [see comment], as people bought meat in Ukraine for a celebration."

He warns the virus must not spread out into nature and infect the wild boars: "We have done a lot informationally, disinfection and annihilating the [outbreak]. We urge people to be cautious and not keep animals older than one year."

Minister Eduard Grama says a joint struggle is necessary to have the problem solved.

[Moldova borders Ukraine on its north, east and south; its western big neighbor is Romania, probably the candidate to become next in line to encounter African swine fever [ASF] (see map at http://tinyurl.com/hsp5r2j).

The distance between the 2 named Moldovan villages, where the backyard holdings are suspected to be ASF-infected, is 9.5 km [about 5.9 miles]. Since the virus is suspected to have been introduced from Ukraine with infected pig meat around St. Mary's Day (15 Aug 2016, about 6 weeks ago) its early eradication/control in Moldova is a very challenging undertaking. In particular, in view of the fact that the number of swine-keeping establishments is, according to Moldova's OIE data (2014 report) not less than 18 000: a huge number of small backyard holdings. The total number of (domestic) swine in Moldova in 2014 was, reportedly, 522 566. The 2014 number of the domestic pig population in Romania was 4 014 335 (the number of establishments not available).

For Romania's preparedness for ASF control please see the presentation discussed during EU's SCOPAFF meeting of 13-14 Sep 2016 in Brussels, at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20160913_pres_asf_rou.pdf.
