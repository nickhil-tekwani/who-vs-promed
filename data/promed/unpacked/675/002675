Early start of tick activity in Munich, Germany
------------------------------------------------
An unusually high tick activity has been observed in a popular inner-city park of Munich. The park was identified in 2021 as a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) natural focus by detection of TBE virus in a number of ticks of the species _Ixodes ricinus_. At least one patient got infected and suffered from clinical overt TBE.

The 1st tick-sampling activity was conducted on 14 Feb this year [2022] and resulted in 36 _I. ricinus_ ticks (15 nymphs, 10 females, 11 males). This is an unusually high number of different stages for this part of the year, as during the nights before, temperatures below 0 deg C [32 deg F] had been reported. In contrast, tick sampling on the same afternoon in a TBE natural focus outside of the city with usually comparable tick numbers during the year resulted in only 3 _I. ricinus_ ticks (1 nymph, 2 females).

Tick activity in the inner city seemed to start very early this year [2022] compared to a very low activity in a TBE focus outside of the city. As ticks were collected from a known TBE focus, there is already now a relevant risk of infection by TBE virus. This early tick activity extends the transmission period of TBE virus for several weeks.

The early start of the tick activity might be due to the basically higher environmental temperatures inside the city compared to outside and due to this year's [2022] mild winter. Usually, the _I. ricinus_ activity in Germany starts only mid- to end of March. The coming situation of the tick activity and prevalence of TBE virus in the ticks will now be monitored continuously during the year to predict an increasing risk of infection in the known TBE foci.

[ProMED thanks Drs Gerhard Dobler and Lidia Chitimia-Dobler for sending in this report.

Finding numbers of active _Ixodes ricinus_ ticks in mid-February is early indeed and makes one wonder if this portends an unusually high level of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus transmission in the city park with increased risk of human cases. The report above may be an illustration of the effects of climate change on tick populations and their acquisition of TBE virus from abundant rodents. The occurrence of human TBE virus infection in 2020 was increased by more frequent recreational use of natural areas by people whose activities were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, leading them to be active in areas where TBE-infected ticks occur (see Tick-borne encephalitis - Germany (03): (BW, BY) 20200924.7808054).

Tick-borne encephalitis is a virus infection caused by one of 3 TBE virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family: Central European, Siberian, and Far Eastern (formerly known as Russian spring-summer encephalitis). It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected _Ixodes_ ticks. A vaccine is available and is recommended for individuals who visit or work in forested areas where the ticks are abundant. - Mod.TY
