Has there been any increase in the water temperature of eastern Long
Island Sound that may stress the lobsters? I suspect there may have
been, and also suspect it has been considered, but it's just a thought.

[An outbreak of shell disease in American lobster (_Homarus
americanus_) over the past several years has generated a great deal
of attention and concern regarding its causes and spread into New
England coastal waters. An examination of the disease within
Massachusetts state waters was conducted from 2000 through 2004. The
overall average incidence observed in our data was 3 percent males
and 8 percent females. Female lobsters were more likely to exhibit
disease symptoms than males, and larger lobsters were more likely to
possess disease symptoms than smaller lobsters.

Disease incidence was highest in May and June, immediately prior to
the molting period, and decreased dramatically through the molting
season. We detected a north to south latitudinal gradient of
increasing shell disease prevalence along the Massachusetts coast.
Over the course of our study period, we found relatively constant low
levels of shell disease in both the Gulf of Maine and Outer Cape Cod
regions. However, a significantly higher level of shell disease was
recorded in the Buzzards Bay region, indicating important differences
in regional prevalence of disease.

Our data suggest that this gradient in shell disease may be related
to an interaction between water temperature, sexual maturity, and
intermolt duration. There is a significant correlation between
disease incidence in Buzzards Bay and a series of warmer than average
water temperatures from 1999 to 2003, which suggests that temperature
may be a primary factor related to the recent outbreak of epizootic
shell disease.

Although this references Massachusetts there may be some similar
correlation with the waters around New York.

The paper: A shell disease in lobsters (_Homarus americanus_) caused
by chitinovorous bacteria- clearly indicates a bacteria, while others
publications are suspicious of the sewage contamination in certain
areas around NY leading to experimental work being done on bacteria
in relationship to higher levels of organic and chemical contaminants.
