Syria does not have a large dog population, free-roaming or otherwise, as dogs have been culturally considered unclean and have been frequently shot or poisoned.

Turkey, however, has been historically rather tolerant of free-roaming dogs and instituted a national dog sterilization program 10 years ago to replace shooting or poisoning street dogs. Unfortunately, the sterilization program has not been very well managed in much of the nation, so much of Turkey still has abundant street dogs.

Jordan and Lebanon have far fewer free-roaming dogs but are nonetheless much more tolerant of dogs than Syria.

This sets up the possibility that, whereas dogs are sometimes implicated in transmitting leishmaniasis to humans, in this situation, human refugees may be inadvertently bringing the sand flies that carry leishmaniasis into more frequent contact with the dogs of Turkey, Jordan, and Lebanon, and the pet keepers and humane communities of those nations may, accordingly, need to escalate vigilance against leishmaniasis, after having not worried about it much for many years.

[ProMED-mail thanks Merritt Clifton for his comment.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is caused by _Leishmania tropica_, and 30 000 cases were reported in 2008 in Syria (Alvar J et al. and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of Its Incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671).

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is rare but is found from Aleppo and towards the Turkish border. The reservoir for _L. tropica_ is small rodents and for _L. infantum_, it is dogs.

In Turkey, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of reported cases since 1995 onwards (Zeyrek FY et al. Serodiagnosis of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) caused by _Leishmania tropica_ in Sanliurfa Province, Turkey, where ACL is highly endemic. Clin Vaccine Immunol 2007;14:1409-15).

A recent upsurge of CL cases in the southeastern Anatolia Region is attributed to the environmental impact of a big irrigation project (Guneydogu Anadolu Projesi-GAP) [Ok UZ et al. Leishmaniasis in Turkey. Acta Trop 2002;84:43-8).

Some CL cases are attributed to _L. infantum_ in the eastern Mediterranean region. The main reservoirs are dogs and humans.

In Jordan, outbreaks of CL have been reported every year for the past 5 years: in Aqaba (2006 and 2007), North Agwar (2008) and South Shuneh (2004 and 2005) with 100-200 cases. Severe underreporting of CL is suspected; between 2001 and 2003, an estimated incidence was 47 times higher than the officially reported number of cases (Mosleh IM et al. (2008). Cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Jordanian side of the Jordan Valley: severe under-reporting and consequences on public health management. Trop Med Int Health 2008;13:855-60).

The main reservoir for _L. infantum is dogs and for _L. major_, small rodents (_Psammomys obesus_, _Meriones libycus_). - Mod.EP
