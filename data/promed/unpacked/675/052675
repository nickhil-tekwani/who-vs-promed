Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Israel
--------------------------------------------
Emergency message: disease never reported before.
Information received on 4 June 2002 from Dr Oded Nir, Director of
Veterinary and Animal Health Services, Ministry of Agriculture and
Rural Development, Beit Dagan:
Report date: 4 Jun 2002.
On 28 May 2002, the preliminary rapid test for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) showed a positive result for a cow. The test was
repeated on 29 May 2002 and followed by the immunohistochemical
test. Both the rapid test and the immunohistochemical test showed
positive results.
The sample in question was sent to the OIE Reference Laboratories for
BSE in Bern (Switzerland). A positive confirmation was received on 4
Jun 2002.
Affected animal and structure of the farm of origin:
-- An Israeli Holstein born on 19 Sep 1992, which had shown clinical
central nervous system signs for 2 days before, died.
-- The establishment is a Kibbutz herd that keeps 1300 dairy heifers and
cows and is situated in the Golan Heights. The affected cow had been
bought as a 2-year-old heifer from another farm situated in the Jordan
Valley.
Measures taken:
-- An immediate ban had been placed on both herds.
-- The affected cow had 3 living cohort mates in the herd of origin. The
cow had 2 living offspring. All those 5 animals are under restriction
and will be destroyed.
Further details will be published in the next issue of Weekly Disease
Information, available on line as from Fri 7 June 2002 afternoon
(GMT).

[Israel is the second non-European country reporting BSE in endemic
cattle, following Japan, which reported its first case in September 2001.
The old age of the affected animal -- almost 10 years -- and the rapid
clinical course, differ from data on most BSE cases in the UK and other
countries, where typical cases are said to have a protracted clinical
course, extending usually over a period of weeks or months, and most
cases were reported in animals 4-5 years of age. - Mod.AS]
