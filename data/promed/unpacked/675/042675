Highly pathogenic bird flu strain killed chickens in Daegu
----------------------------------------------------------
South Korea's quarantine service said Saturday [3 May 2008] that a
highly pathogenic strain of the bird flu virus was responsible for
the sudden death of chickens at a private home in Daegu.

The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service (NVRQS) said
the H5N1 strain of the bird flu killed the 5 birds at the private
home in the industrial city 302 kilometers [187 miles] southeast of Seoul.

It said to prevent further spreading of the avian influenza, 260
chickens raised in 3 small-scale farms within a 3-km [1.8-mile]
radius of the home have been culled and buried.

Quarantine officials said the 5 chickens were purchased at a local
open air market and are tracking where the birds came from.

Earlier in the week, the government said it would ban the sale of all
poultry sold at traditional markets that are open at regular
intervals. The measures were taken after experts said the recent
outbreaks in the southeastern Gyeongsang region were caused by people
buying birds from such markets, which have largely escaped government
oversight owing to their relatively small size.

Authorities meanwhile said that decontamination efforts were underway
within 10 km [6.2 miles] of the Daegu home with close observation
being carried out on homes and small-time poultry farms within this zone.

The government has been catching considerable flak for failing to
contain the outbreaks, which have generally been centered around the
Jeolla region in southwestern South Korea.

Bird flu deaths advance southeast
---------------------------------
Bird flu outbreaks in Korea are spreading to Korea's southeast as
poultry deaths from the H5 virus were reported in the cities of Busan
and Daegu this week [28 Apr - 2 May 2008]. The cases came one day
after 2 new cases were confirmed Thursday [1 May 2008] in Ulsan, 69
km (43 miles) from Busan and Yeongcheon, 35 km from Daegu, officials
said yesterday.

4 chickens died at the Gijang farm in Busan and 5 chickens died in
Suseong District in Daegu this week due to the avian influenza virus.
All remaining 370 chickens at the infected sites were slaughtered.

The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service is conducting
more tests to determine if the virus that killed the chickens is the
H5N1 strain, which is highly contagious to birds and can infect humans.

Government authorities had confirmed 2 cases of bird flu in the
cities of Ulsan and Yeongcheon, Gyeongsang provinces, that led to
culling of about 50 000 poultry within a 3-km radius of the infected farms.

Authorities also ordered a ban on the movement of about 600 000 fowls
within a 10-km radius of the infected farms. "We just finished
slaughtering chickens at the bird flu-infected farms", said a
Yeongcheon county official, declining to be named. "We are very busy
trying to stop the spread of bird flu outbreak in our region".

The most recent confirmed outbreaks mean the bird flu that started at
a Gimje farm in southwestern Korea at the beginning of April 2008 is
now spreading southeast.

Since the 1st confirmed case of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza
was found at a Gimje farm in North Jeolla in early April, 31
confirmed cases have been found in Jeolla, Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and
Gyeongsang provinces, prompting the slaughter of more than 6.4
million chickens and ducks.

That exceeds the culling of 5 million poultry in the 2003 bird flu outbreak.

the country. Only the north-eastern province of Gangweon, North
Chungcheong in the centre and the southern island of Jeju have been
unaffected so far. - Mod.JW]
