More children killed by rabies outbreak in Peru's jungle
--------------------------------------------------------
At present, 5 children from the indigenous communities of Awajun and
Wampis have died in Peru due to rabies spread by vampire bats,
according to information issued by the Ministry of Health. This case
brings the total number of fatalities in this outbreak to 20.

Fernando Borjas, a local health official said that some 3500 people
had been bitten by these vampire bats, and warned that there are not
enough vaccines in the affected areas since these are located in
remote places. To make matter worse, some indigenous people were
reported to have refused treatment [vaccination].

Vampire bats usually feed on animals, but sometimes, if potential
prey become scarce, they may attack humans, especially when their
habitat has been destroyed.

Rabid Vampire Bats Kill 5 Children In Peru
------------------------------------------
At least 5 children in a remote Amazon region of Peru have now died
of rabies after being bitten by rabid vampire bats, say health
officials, bringing the total number of deaths in this latest outbreak to 20.

A Health Ministry announcement, reported by the Peruvian press, said
that: "We have received reports of 5 children killed in an outbreak
of rabies that has been going on for several months in the
region." The children, all aged between 5 and 10 years, were from
the Awajun and Wampis indigenous communities situated about 600 miles
north of the capital Lima, on the border with Ecuador. According to a
local news report relayed by Noticias24, it has been suggested that 3
more children may also have died from rabies, but this could not be
confirmed because, due to their beliefs, their families refused to
allow their bodies to be autopsied.

Communities in this part of the remote jungle are often affected by
outbreaks of attack by blood-sucking bats, reports Peru's La Jornada.
This outbreak of rabies has been confirmed by the capture of several
bats infected by rabies, they reported earlier today.

Rabies is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the brain in
warm-blooded animals. It is usually fatal in unvaccinated people
unless treated straight away. The virus is usually transmitted via
bites from infected animals.

A local health official told the press that about 3500 people have
been bitten by vampire bats in the 2 communities so far this year
[2010]. He said this number was likely to rise because of the
difficulties and the cost of trying to get vaccines to these remote
areas. Fernando Borjas, a doctor in the regional health directorate,
said the outbreak started several months ago, and that it can take up
to 15 hours by river to reach the remote jungle communities, by which
time it is often too late to vaccinate people.

According to the UK's Daily Telegraph, Borjas said "we cannot get
them the vaccines quickly enough because the communities are so
remote." He said the bats feed at night, and when they don't find
large animals to feed on, they bite unprotected people. Some reports
suggest the bats are turning to humans for food because their rain
forest habitats are disappearing; there are also reports that the
local people say the temperatures in recent years have been unusually
low in the Amazon region and that could also be a [factor].

Borjas said Peru's health ministry have been sending emergency teams
to the region and so far around 900 people have been immunized. But
there are still thousands without vaccine, and some people have
refused to be treated [vaccinated]. Other sources reported by
Noticias24 suggest that some communities are also failing to protect
themselves with mosquito nets, which are thought to be a simple way
to stop the bats from biting.

[The Awajun (Aguaruna) are an indigenous people of the Peruvian
jungle. Historically, they lived primarily on the banks of the
Maranon River, a tributary of the Amazon in northern Peru near the
border with Ecuador. Currently, they possess titled community lands
in 4 of Peru's regions: Amazonas, Cajamarca, Loreto, and San Martin.
According to Peru's 1993 Census the Aguaruna (Awajun) numbered
approximately 45 000. World Census data for 2000 lists their
population at just over 38 000 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aguaruna>.

It is estimated now that approximately 3500 people have been bitten
by vampire bats and the number of deaths has risen to at least 20,
which includes 5 children between the ages of 5 and 10 years. Another
3 children are suspected to have died as a result of rabies virus
infection, but this cannot be confirmed. Hopefully the use of
mosquito netting to provide protection against bats at night combined
with the developing vaccination campaign will help to stem this
outbreak which is several months old.
