[Farmed mink are highly susceptible to SARS-Cov-2.

"In January 2021, a risk assessment was developed by GLEWS+ on SARS-CoV-2 and animals used in fur farming (see report at https://www.oie.int/app/uploads/2021/03/glews-risk-assessment-fur-animals-sars-cov-2.pdf). This tripartite assessment conducted by FAO, the OIE and WHO, focuses on fur farms and Mustelidae, the only farmed species that has reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 to date. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 in fur farms impacts animal health and animal welfare, and poses a risk of spill over to native wildlife which may affect the biodiversity of species. The presence of this virus in mink farms may also have an important impact on public health and economic well-being contributing to widespread socioeconomic disruption".
