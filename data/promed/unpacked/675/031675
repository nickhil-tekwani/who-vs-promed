Four out of a total of eight patients who underwent cataract surgery on 6
April, 1998 in the Ophthalmology Unit at the teaching hospital Umberto I in
Rome developed severe endophthalmitis, presumed due to _Bacillus cereus_.
By 7 April, the second, fourth, seventh, and eighth patients on the
operating list had similar, severe endophthalmitis. Conjunctival swabs were
immediately sent to the microbiology laboratory for investigation and
repeated the next day. _B. cereus_ was isolated from the second and
seventh patients, while _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _S. epidermidis_ were
isolated from patients eight and four. Three days after surgery the
condition of patients two and seven became critical and the infected eyes
had to be eviscerated. _B. cereus_ of indistinguishable antibiogram
pattern was isolated from the eye tissue of both patients. Patients four
and eight are recovering very slowly, but their clinical features lead us
to believe that they too had _B. cereus_ endophthalmitis.
Unfortunately, all surgical materials had already been discarded when the
epidemiological investigation team was alerted, and the detailed mechanism
of transmission could therefore not be identified. It has been established
that a total of eight surgeons worked in the operating theatre that day.
Each patient was attended by a team of three, in different combinations.
One surgeon operated on all four infected patients only, and another on the
four infected plus two (patients three and five) who remained well. A third
surgeon operated, with the other two, on patient seven only, who became
infected. Patients one and six, who remained well, were operated on by
three of the other five surgeons.
Extensive sampling was carried out in the surgical unit environment and on
personnel. _B. cereus_ was isolated from dust sampled from a shelf in the
sterilisation room of the operating theatre. This isolate, along with the
two clinical isolates, is being examined using the polymerase chain
reaction. Attention to hygiene in the surgical procedures also appeared to
be inadequate and may have contributed to the _B. cereus_ infection in
patients.

[_Bacillus cereus_, spore-forming bacillus, is most commonly recognized as
an occasional cause of food poisoning because of enterotoxins produced.
This organism is also an occasional cause of serious infections in the case
of immunologically impaired patients, and especially with the presence of
foreign bodies or prosthetic devices. The organism is a recognized cause
of serious infection and loss of vision subsequent to penetrating ocular
trauma. - Mod.ES]
