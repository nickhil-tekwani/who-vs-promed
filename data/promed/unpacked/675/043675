Deaths attributed to pertussis (whooping cough) mounted to 13 in a span of 16 days in Dera Bugti in Balochistan as 3 more children died on Mon 26 Jan 2015. As many as 11 deaths were confirmed in Peer Koh [Dera Bugti] while the deceased included a 1.5-year-old male, 4 male and 5 female 1-year-olds, and a 2-year old male.

The only healthcare worker working at the Basic Health Unit revealed that population of Peer Koh is estimated to be 20 000, and he can provide vaccination to only 5 percent of the population. Locals told Dunya News that the media is focused on the deaths in Tharparker (Sindh Province) alone and if due attention will not be given to the situation of whooping cough locally, significant human tragedies might arise.

[The scope of this outbreak is not clear. Most pertussis-associated deaths are in quite young, unimmunized children who are in contact with older children or young adults who have milder illness. Pertussis mortality can be minimized not only by immunization with trivalent vaccine against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, but also by early antimicrobial intervention. Large populations of susceptible people in the developing world are the cause of large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.

Balochistan (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan) is the largest of Pakistan's 4 provinces in terms of area, constituting approximately 44 percent of the country's total land mass, and the smallest in terms of population, being home to less than 5 percent of the country's population. Balochistan province is bordered by Afghanistan to the north and north-west, Iran to the south-west, the Arabian Sea to the south, Punjab and Sindh to the east, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas to the north-east. Quetta is the capital and largest city of Balochistan. - Mod.LL]
