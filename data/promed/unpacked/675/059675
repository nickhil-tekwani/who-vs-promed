CWD found in Saskatchewan deer
------------------------------
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has turned up in a new part of Saskatchewan
and in a different kind of deer. A 2 year old white-tailed buck, shot by a
hunter in the Paradise Hill district north of Lloydminster, is the 7th
positive case found in the wild deer population since early 2001. This fall
4 cases were found in animals killed by hunters. The previous cases had all
been in western Saskatchewan, but south of Lloydminster.
Kevin Omoth of Saskatchewan Environment said he couldn't explain why
several positives have turned up in a relatively short period of time.
There is no way to predict the results, he said. "Last fall [2001?] we
tested I think 5300 plus and didn't get one positive," he said, but the
following spring [2002] officials tested 185 and one was positive. Omoth
said the discovery that the disease is further north than previously
thought is a concern. "We'll have to work (the area) into our strategy for
next year," he said, referring to herd reduction programs.
Omoth also said it's no surprise that the disease surfaced in white-tailed
deer. "The Americans have been telling us they are equally susceptible," he
said. Of the 7 positive tests, 5 were mule deer bucks, one was a mule deer
doe, and now the white-tailed buck.
CWD has not shown up in wild elk and Omoth said officials don't expect it
will, although it is a possibility. Where it is most prevalent in the US
wild population, it affects about 16 per cent of deer but less than one per
cent of elk, he said. Saskatchewan Environment said last week 4000 deer
heads had been submitted for testing so far. Omoth said the cooperation of
hunters and landowners has been invaluable in the fight to control CWD. The
department would like to test as many heads as possible and is still asking
hunters to drop off frozen samples at their local department office.
Hunters should supply their name and address and the date and location
where the animal was killed. Antlers should be removed. Hunters are also
reminded that the department does not accept animal hides. They should be
dropped off at Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation depots.
