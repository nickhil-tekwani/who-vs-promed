The Chubut Ministry of Health stated the child who was admitted to the Epuyen Hospital 2 days ago and was taken to Bariloche as a suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection], was confirmed as "positive" [for the infection] after tests done by the Malbran Institute; with this case, the number affected by this disease, which is transmitted by the long-tail mouse, increases to 14 including 5 fatalities.

In the last part of the official announcement, the Chubut Ministry of Health indicated that "the contingency team continues to work in Epuyen, focusing their action on selective respiratory isolation of people classified as close contacts [of the patient]," adding that the child, who was sent to the Bariloche Hospital in Rio Negro [province] is currently in stable condition.

Epuyen, with a population of approximately 4000 inhabitants and the epicenter of the outbreak, is located in the extreme northwest of Chubut [province], in the so-called Andean region. About 220 blood samples have been taken to test for those who are potentially affected [infected].

The samples for testing were taken from people who were at the quinceanera [a party for children, usually girls, celebrating their 15th birthday], where presumably the outbreak started, to which was added the so-called "continent population," that is, those neighbors with whom the potential bearers [of the virus] made close contact, especially family, as well as the population at risk of the municipality and health personnel.

[Epuyen is located in the Andes mountains, and the virus most likely involved, although not stated, is Andes hantavirus, which is endemic in the southern Andes. This is the beginning of the summer season there, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. Health officials in this and a previous report hypothesize that the outbreak is due to human-to-human transmission, which would be unusual. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person and only through close physical contact, usually within the family. Transmission of the virus person to person at a party would seems unlikely. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat or its excretions. The patients likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the region.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg and an additional map of the area can be found here: https://www.ezilon.com/maps/south-america/argentina-maps.html. - Mod.TY
