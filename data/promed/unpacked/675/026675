Cases of whooping cough in the West Midlands [England] have almost doubled during the past 2 years, new figures reveal. The number of patients diagnosed with the contagious infection has also risen across the Black Country and Staffordshire [West Midlands].

Whooping cough -- a bacterial infection of the lungs and airways -- affects all ages, but newborns and infants under 3 months of age are at highest risk of severe complications and death.

During 2014 there were 135 cases in the West Midlands -- 39 of those were in the Black Country and Staffordshire. This is up by 42 per cent compared with 2013's figures when there were a total of 95 cases in the West Midlands.

Health chiefs have urged pregnant women to have a vaccination to protect themselves and their unborn babies against the risk of the infection, also known as pertussis. It protects the baby from developing whooping cough in the first few weeks of life as the mother passes immunity on to her unborn child, protecting the youngster until they receive their first vaccination at 2 months old. All pregnant women are offered vaccination against whooping cough when they are 28-38 weeks pregnant.

In 2014, the highest number of cases were diagnosed in Sandwell and Walsall with 12 patients in each borough suffering from the infection. This is compared with 4 cases and 6 cases respectively in 2013. The figure has also risen in Wolverhampton from 2 to 3 cases.

But the number of people being diagnosed fell in Dudley from 10 cases to 4, in Cannock from 3 to 2 and in Stafford from 4 to 2. The number of cases remained static in Wyre Forest with 2 reported in both 2013 and 2014.

Jyoti Atri, director of public health at Sandwell Council, said it was important to get vaccinated to prevent the risk of catching the infection, adding: "Whooping cough is highly contagious and newborns are particularly vulnerable. It's vital that babies are protected from the day they are born - that's why the vaccine is being offered to all pregnant women. If you are pregnant, getting vaccinated is the best way you can protect your baby against whooping cough."

The condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough that progresses to intense bouts of coughing. The gasping for breath after one of these coughing bouts causes a distinctive 'whooping' noise, which is how the infection gets its name. The coughing can last for around three months.

The Midlands is an area spanning central England, with a population of 9 439 516 (2001 census), but does not correspond to any current administrative area. Its largest city is Birmingham, and the greater part of the area is now administered as the Government Office Regions of the West Midlands and East Midlands (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midlands). Wolverhampton (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton), Sandwell (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandwell), and Walsall (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walsall) are located in the West Midlands, surrounding the city of Birmingham.
