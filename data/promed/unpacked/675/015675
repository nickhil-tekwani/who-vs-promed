DNR: chronic wasting disease contained in 2 West Virginia counties
---------------------------------------------------------
Chronic wasting disease [CWD] in West Virginia (WV) deer is believed
to be contained in Hampshire and Hardy counties, but the West Virginia
Division of Natural Resources [DNR] continues to be vigilant in its
efforts to control the disease.

CWD is a neurological, brain and nervous system disease of deer and
elk. The 1st confirmed case of it in the Mountain State was in a
road-kill deer found in Hampshire County in 2005. Since then, 99 cases
have been confirmed in Hampshire and Hardy counties -- one in Hardy
and the rest in Hampshire. The agency regularly tests both road-kill
deer and hunter-harvested deer as part of a CWD containment area that
includes all of Hampshire County, the northern part of Hardy County
and the western part of Morgan County.

The DNR has tested road-kill deer in all 55 counties for CWD since
2002. In cooperation with the Southeast Cooperative Wildlife Disease
Study at the University of Georgia and the Minnesota Veterinary
Diagnostic Laboratory, more than 12 200 deer from West Virginia have
been tested for the abnormal prion associated with CWD.

According to Richard Rogers, district wildlife biologist for the West
Virginia Division of Natural Resources, CWD is not harmful to humans.
As far as we know -- and nobody is actually 100 percent sure -- CWD is
not harmful to humans. There is still a lot of research to be done,"
said Rogers.

As of June [2011], CWD has been found in free-ranging deer and elk in
14 other states and 2 Canadian provinces. The disease has been
confirmed in captive or farm-raised deer and elk in 10 states and 2
provinces, but not in West Virginia. [CWD has been confirmed in WV,
just not in their captive or farmed animals. - Mod.TG]

Officials say the disease can be spread both directly via
animal-to-animal and indirectly through soils or other surfaces. "It
is most commonly spread from animal-to-animal," said Rogers. Because
of the risk of spreading CWD, hunters are prohibited from transporting
dead carcass of deer or elk beyond the boundary of the containment
area.

"Spinal material and brain matter is what we believe to contain CWD.
That has to stay where it is and not be moved because they are the
most likely contaminated tissues," said Rogers.

The DNR said the discovery of CWD in Hampshire County represented a
significant threat to the state's white-tailed deer. The agency said
the disease can be described as a 30- to 50-year epidemic on the deer
population.

Infected deer and elk may not show any signs of the disease. The
disease is thought to be caused by a protein called a prion that
accumulates in the brain and the lymphatic tissues. However, deer that
appear sickly or emaciated should be reported to the DNR immediately.
In some stages of the disease, infected animals begin to lose control
of bodily function and display abnormal behavior such as staggering.
The disease is always fatal for the infected animal.

Those deer hunting in Hampshire, Hardy, or Morgan counties are asked
to refer to the special West Virginia regulations regarding carcass
transport and baiting in the hunting and trapping regulations summary
online at http://www.wvdnr.gov.

According to the DNR, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland
Fisheries has detected 2 positive deer in Frederick County just east
of the Hampshire County line. The Maryland Department of Natural
Resources has detected one positive deer in Allegany County just north
of the Hampshire County line.

[This represents a nice summary of the area regarding CWD. It may also
represent a success story of containment. But one must remember that,
on average, a deer has a home territory range of only about 2-2.5
miles (3-4 km) in radius. - Mod.TG]
