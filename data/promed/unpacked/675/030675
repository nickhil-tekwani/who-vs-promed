Deadly fish virus spreads to West Sumatra
------------------------------------------
Millions of carp and gurami have been found dead in a lake and river in
West Sumatra province, following a similar disaster recently in Lake Toba,
North Sumatra province.
With the help of excavators, farmers and government employees worked
together on Monday [8 Nov 2004] to remove hundreds of tons of dead fish
from karamba [floating cages or holding pens] in Lake Maninjau, Agam
regency and Batang Sumpur river in Pasaman regency.
M. Kamil, a veterinarian from Agam Animal Husbandry and Fishery Office,
explained on Monday that staffers at his office had begun detect[ing] the
spread of the koi herpesvirus a few weeks ago in 17 karamba in Lake
Maninjau. Staffers then ordered the fish farmers to separate the infected
fish from the healthy fish, but it was too late. Millions of fish had
already died; after the removal, the amount of fish totaled 2.5 tons.
The virus quickly attacked other fish in another 4000 karamba in the lake,
killing a large number of fish in each karamba, said Kamil.
The fish were certain to have been infected with Koi herpesvirus, which is
seen from the white or black coloring of the gills and the shedding of scales.
"Samples of the fish have been dispatched to a fish laboratory in Sukabumi,
West Java, and it is positive that the fish were infected with Koi herpes,"
said Kamil.
Kamil explained that there was no cure for fish infected with Koi herpes,
so that he suggested that the farmers harvest the healthy fish and at the
same time, remove the infected fish and bury them. The karamba should be
left empty for at least 4 months to ensure the habitat is free from the
virus, thus ensuring it will not come back.
Kamil said that the virus was believed to come from Solok regency, also in
West Sumatra province, following an earlier report that the fish in the
area were infected by Koi herpes a few months ago.
In Pasaman regency some 850 tons of carp and gurami were removed from
karamba in Batang Sumpur river.
Pasaman deputy regent Benny Utama said on Monday that the government was
looking into ways to help the fish farmers.
Fish farming is a prominent industry in Pasaman regency. In 2003, fish
farmers in the regency produced 1884 carp and gurami fry, which were sold
to several other provinces on Sumatra island. The farmers also sold dozens
of tons of gurami and carp to traders in the regency and outside regencies.
People in Pasaman [alone] consume some 13 000 tons of gurami and carp per year.
Some 5000 households here are involved in the karamba business.
Meanwhile, a fishery expert from Bung Hatta University in Padang, the
capital of West Sumatra province, explained that the virus spread quickly
in temperatures below 25 Celsius.
"The water temperature has dropped in West Sumatra province after rain fell
in the area recently, enabling the virus to spread fast," said Hafrizal
Syandri. Syandri, on the other hand, believed that the virus came from Java
Island through fish fry [see comment].
The disaster in West Sumatra came after the death of millions of carp in
Lake Toba last week. The Simalungun regental government has banned the
consumption of fish from the lake and also instructed the farmers to take
the necessary measures to prevent the virus from spreading.

[A fish disease, suspected to be caused by Koi herpesvirus (KHV), has been
initially reported in Indonesia (East Java) in April 2002. The virus, which
reportedly had been introduced through importation of koi carp from another
country, subsequently spread rapidly throughout Java Island (see
20020630.4639]. Its current penetration into Sumatra is not overly surprising.
KHV is not included among the 16 fish diseases listed in OIE's
International Aquatic Animal Health Code, 2004. It would be of utmost
importance to carry out surveillance, to report, and to take measures to
prevent the introduction of this serious pathogen into the carp populations
of countries where this species is a major source of animal protein. For
the provisions of international trade in live fish related to listed
diseases, see <http://oie.int/eng/normes/fcode/A_summry.htm>.
KHV has already been identified in at least 10 European countries, in
Israel, the USA, Japan and Indonesia. Though the great majority of the
outbreaks have affected ornamental fish, KHV disease has been reported in
common carp farms in Germany and Indonesia. It poses a serious threat to
the extensive pond culture of food carp in East-European countries as well
as wild carp populations all over Europe and Asia. It could become a
serious world threat to carp production, diminishing the protein supply for
large human populations.
According to FAO statistics, the world cyprinid (mainly carp) annual
production is approximately 17 million tons, of which more than 12 million
tons are produced in China. The KHV situation there is not known; we repeat
our request (see 20040907.2497) for any available information on relevant
KHV monitoring activities in China. - Mod.AS]
