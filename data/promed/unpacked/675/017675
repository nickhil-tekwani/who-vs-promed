[With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases there have now been a total of 129 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia since the beginning of this year (1 Jan 2019) including 25 deaths (reported case fatality rate 19.4 percent). Of note is that both newly reported cases are classified as secondary cases; one, part of the growing cluster now up to 10 cases in Al Khafji, Ash Sharqiyah (Eastern) region, the other a new secondary spread noted in Jizan region, probably related to contact with the 39-year-old male reported from Jizan city on 2 Apr 2019, and reported as a fatality at the time of the initial confirmation report.

Geographically Jizan region is the most southerly region in the western part of Saudi Arabia, whereas Ash Sharqiyah (Eastern) region, is in the southeastern of the country.
