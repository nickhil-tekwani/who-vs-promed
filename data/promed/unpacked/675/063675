30 workers of a cleaning company in Albadaye'a governorate of Qassim
were found to have cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The company said the infected workers worked near farms and swamps.
It said the unavailability of medication led to the disease spreading
among the workers.

Infections can be treated in many ways if the sores do not heal on
their own, which happens often, said Abdullah Al-Suqair, Assistant
general director of the Primary Healthcare department. He said the
disease is transmitted by the 2 millimeter-sized sand fly from
infected animals to humans. He said it "is hard to eradicate, but the
healthcare efforts to combat the disease are continuing. The disease
in the Kingdom can be found in the regions of Qassim, Madina and
Riyadh. However, it is present particularly in Qassim, given the
agriculture and grazing activities which can provide an environment
for the parasites."

He said infections in Qassim are determined annually by the weather
because the sand fly is more active in hot and mild weather, and also
because people are more involved in outdoor activities during these
periods.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Saudi Arabia, and the workers could have
been infected from a common source. A recent study from the area
(Shalaby I et al. Genotypic Characterization of Cutaneous
Leishmaniasis at al Baha and Al Qasim Provinces (Saudi Arabia). Vector
Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2011 Mar 21. [Epub ahead of print]) found both _L.
tropica_ and _L. major_ in biopsies from skin lesions.

The occurrence of leishmaniasis in the region has recently been
reviewed (Postigo JA. Leishmaniasis in the World Health Organization
Eastern Mediterranean Region. Int J Antimicrob Agents. 2010;36(Suppl
1):S62-5). For the HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia, see
