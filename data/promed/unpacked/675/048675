[Following the termination of the 2005 Bluetongue season, Pablo Nart
has extracted the following final data. - Mod.AS]
Since the last update (29 Sep 2005)[see ProMED post 20050929.2855], BT
infection has been detected in 23 additional premises.
The new outbreaks by region/province are:
Ceuta (1)
Madrid (1)
Castilla La Mancha (total 5: Toledo 1, Ciudad Real 4)
Castilla y Leon (total 3: Salamanca 2, Avila 1)
Andalucia (total 7: Cordoba 5, Huelva 2).
The species affected during the said period:
24 Bovine
1 Ovine
2 Caprine and Ovine
Total accumulated since the beginning of the current season (not
including 6 registered early in January 2005, which belong to the
previous year's disease season:
Extremadura 25 (Caceres 11, Badajoz 14)
Andalucia 39 (Huelva 19, Sevilla 17 and Cordoba 3)
Castilla y Leon (Avila 2, Salamanca 2)
Castilla la Mancha (Toledo 1)
See map, including areas under animal movement restrictions and
surveillance (almost 20 percent of Spain's territory):

f>.
By species (total 2005):
77 Bovine
1 Caprine
2 Caprine and Ovine
2 Ovine
3 new provinces have been affected west of the previous area of BT
virus detection (Andalucia and Extremadura): Cordoba (3), Madrid (1),
and Salamanca (2).
The localities in the Salamanca province are situated on latitude
north 40:26:10, on the northern slopes of the Central mountain
system, less than 2 km from the Portuguese border.
The Iberic Central mountain system, located west-southwest to
east-northeast, divides central Spain into northern and southern
subregions, with peaks of up to 2600 meters, continuing westwards
into Portugal, several km north of Lisbon.
These findings are indicative that the virus may have crossed this
important geographic barrier, extending its area of activity further
north into the stock breeding areas of Salamanca.
Viral activity has been reported in goats and sheep in Ceuta, a
Spanish city on the north coast of the African continent, bordering
Morocco, which is generally suspected as the origin of the ongoing
spanish BTV epizootic.
There is no reported incidence of BT from some areas where
_Culicoides imicola_ has been detected, such as central Spain and the
Mediterranean coast up to France. The vector has been detected as
high as latitude 42 north in both the Mediterranean (Gerona) and
Atlantic coast (Pontevedra).
For a map of Culicoides distribution, 2005, see:

[It seems that the outbreak, which peaked in southern Spain, southern
Portugal, and Corsica (France) in 2002-2004, has subsided. The
disease's season is limited to the late summer/autumn months.
Data (particularly bovine serology, which is the preferable indicator
for virus activity) from other European territories, such as Italy
(Sicily, Sardinia) and the Balkans, will be of interest. - Mod.AS]
