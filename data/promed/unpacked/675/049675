We have received a number of letters concerning "Chronic wasting disease - USA (14): new research" Archive Number: 20190913.6671713 published by ProMED on 13 Sep 2019. The authors of these letters point out that the concept of _Spiroplasma_ causing chronic wasting disease is a theory that has not been proven or replicated and is not widely accepted. Although the paper in question was published in a peer-reviewed journal, they question the results. We post below a response from one reader and a review of the topic posted earlier this year, prior to this most recent publication, by a veterinary researcher at Cornell.

I have been working in the field of chronic wasting disease (CWD) research for 15 years now, starting with a PhD in Ed Hoover's lab at Colorado State University in 2004. The prion theory, whereby a misfolded form of the normal prion protein coerces its normally folded counterpart to take that abnormal formation, is as incontrovertible for me as the theories of both gravity and evolution. There are innumerable proofs of this theory in the literature, thousands of manuscripts going back more than 4 decades in support of the concept. There are scientists who I greatly respect that have paved roads into this field and allowed more casual researchers like myself to work towards solutions for managing this rampant disease, one which has over the past few decades been identified in a range of cervid species on several continents.

I was alarmed to read the unfortunate comments offered by a ProMED moderator on what most in my field would consider "fringe theories" on the topic of TSEs (ProMED post 20190913.6671713). These ideas on _Spiroplasma_ are as far as it gets from "scientifically proven."

I suppose it shouldn't be surprising in the era of cries of fake news coming from actual fake sources, manipulated weather forecasts, and organized misinformation campaigns seeking to derail our efforts to manage significant human diseases like Ebola and plague (https://www.cfr.org/blog/disinformation-and-disease-social-media-and-ebola-epidemic-democratic-republic-congo, https://www.cfr.org/blog/disinformation-and-disease-social-media-and-ebola-epidemic-democratic-republic-congo and https://www.france24.com/en/20171004-panic-madagascar-plague-spreadshttps://www.france24.com/en/20171004-panic-madagascar-plague-spreads>) but I am surprised to see it surface now on ProMED. This resource is used not only by health professionals the world over, but our students as well, and it should serve as a source for the most current, rigorously tested science we have available.

It also should not surprise me that this is creeping into the field of CWD - now that other prion disorders like BSE and scrapie have some history of management success. Chronic wasting disease is different - intractable, sometimes stochastic in its appearance, a political hot potato. People dealing with this disease, from deer farmers to veterinarians to game biologists to politicians, are often desperate for answers, in the face of ever-dwindling resources for providing those answers. The field is ripe for fringe theories, though in my opinion they have no place on a forum like ProMED.

I will be the first to admit that not all of us working on CWD can agree on the best way to manage this disease in wild and farmed cervids. We are anything but a cohesive unit with a common goal of stopping this disease in its tracks, and that alone troubles me. But there is one thing most working against this disease do agree on: we are dealing with a transmissible misfolded protein, one which contaminates the environment, spreads easily between cervids, and ultimately contributes to their demise.

I appreciate the opportunity to correct the record,

Prion Hypothesis for CWD: An Examination of the Evidence
--------------------------------------------------------
As a wildlife disease ecologist, I've been asked my opinion on the scientific support for prions as the agent of chronic wasting disease (CWD). I have been studying CWD for 2 decades. The _Spiroplasma_ (bacteria) theory (1) has been around for years, but has recently resurfaced. I'll lay out the many reasons why prions are implicated in all transmissible spongiform encephalopathy diseases (TSE). No other infectious agent has the same amount of evidence.

First off, what is a prion? Dr. Stanley Prusiner first described prions in 1982 (2) and coined the term prion as shorter version of "proteinaceous infectious particle." (Smart guy - he won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1997.) A prion is a cellular protein normally produced by all mammals. In this normal form, prions are relatively unstable and are broken down quickly by proteases (enzymes that break down proteins and peptides). Disease happens when the protein change shape and are no longer broken down by proteases. Prions end up clumping together and poisoning brain cells, causing them to die and form holes in the brain (3).

There are many different TSE diseases. Some are genetic and happen along familial lines, some apparently occur spontaneously (ex. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans), some are caused by feeding behavior (ex. "mad cow" disease), but scrapie in sheep and CWD in deer, elk, moose, and reindeer are the only 2 TSEs that are contagious (i.e., transmissible via contact). All prion diseases have several characteristics in common that do not fit with a bacteria or virus as the source of the infection.

Lines of evidence:

1. There is not an immune response to CWD like other disease agents (4).
When a foreign virus or bacteria enters the body, the immune system starts to fight it. There is inflammation and fever. The body produces antibodies to the disease agent. We do not see these processes in CWD.

2. Prions are resistant to normal disinfection procedures that kill bacteria and viruses.
Prions can withstand high temperatures, radiation, and chemicals (including formalin) that would normally kill bacteria and viruses. Commonly used methods, such as autoclaving, decreases infectivity but does not completely eliminate it. Harsh chemicals, like bleach, must have an extended contact time to break down the protein.

3. Prions can last in the environment for years.
Multiple studies looking at CWD and scrapie have attempted to "clean" pastures and then restock with animals (5). This involves decontaminating all equipment or structures and leaving the area fallow for 2 or more years. Invariably, new animals end up becoming diseased because prions can bind to steel and soil particles, where they remain infectious. Scrapie persisted in infected sheep paddocks in Iceland for at least 16 years (6).

4. Genetic studies have shown that "knock-out" animals that do not produce normal prions do not get TSEs.
Genetically engineered animals that lack the prion gene have been produced in a variety of species from mice to cattle. These animals do not produce normal cellular prion protein, and therefore, are not susceptible to TSEs (7).

5. Synthetic "artificial" prions have been created and they cause TSE-like disease.
Most studies use brain material as the source of prions for infection trials, which could potentially transfer other disease agents. However, researchers created prions in _E. coli_ bacteria and produced disease in mice, which is compelling evidence that prions are infectious proteins (8).

6. Bacteria have not been identified in diseased animal tissues using a variety of testing methods (9, 10). DNA or RNA from a virus or bacteria has not been identified consistently in diseased animals.

Examining infected tissues under a microscope has not demonstrated that bacteria are present. If _Spiroplasma_ was the cause, genetic sequencing should be able to find the DNA or RNA for those bacteria in samples. Highly sensitive tests used only to amplify proteins have generated infectious prions (11). Originally, Dr. Prusiner examined scrapie and found if he inactivated all DNA or RNA in the source material, when he infected experimental animals they still ended up diseased. If he got rid of all the proteins in the source material, the disease agent was no longer infectious (2).

While prions still are challenging and there is still plenty to be learned, we would be taking a step backwards in the fight against CWD if we are distracted by nay-sayers. Hundreds of scientists are investigating prion diseases. The evidence is compelling.

"Based on the available data, the idea that prions consist of viruses or any other type of conventional micro-organism is simply untenable" Soto 2011 (12). "These findings have proven beyond any doubt that the prion hypothesis was indeed correct. This does not mean that everything is known regarding prions. On the contrary, there are many outstanding questions still unanswered."

While the public may become frustrated with the unanswered questions around CWD, the one thing we should agree on is stopping prions from being introduced to new areas. Prevention is our best strategy.
