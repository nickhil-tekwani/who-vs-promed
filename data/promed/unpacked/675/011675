Utah: Chickens, horses and mosquitoes test West Nile virus-positive
---------------------------------------------------
Utah public health officials report that West Nile virus (WNV) has been found
in Utah. Blood taken from 2 chickens near Price, Utah, shows the presence of
WNV. In addition, just this morning [Fri 15 Aug 2003], tests showed that 2
horses from Uintah & Emery counties are positive for WNV. Also today,
preliminary-positive results are reported in 2 pools of mosquitoes from Utah
County and Uintah counties. This means that WNV has been identified in Utah.
No human cases [are so far known] have been acquired in Utah.
The preliminary test results of sentinel chicken blood, taken late last week,
showed the presence of WNV. These tests were processed at the Utah State
University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Further testing at the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, today confirmed that the
chickens had been infected with WNV. Chickens are infected through bites from
infected mosquitoes. Chickens are used as "sentinels" to detect when the
virus is present in mosquitoes as a warning for humans, horses, and other
animals. Testing of sentinel chickens, dead birds, and mosquitoes will
continue statewide. However, tracking and monitoring resources may be shifted
to look for the virus in other areas of the state. To date, 14 people, 9
horses, 262 chickens (bled weekly), 98 dead birds, and thousands of
mosquitoes have been tested for WNV in Utah and only 2 chickens and 2 horses
have tested positive.
It is very important to continue vaccinating horses with the WNV vaccine.
Mosquito abatement efforts will continue statewide and will be increased in
areas where WNV has been found.

[Confirmation of West Nile virus infection in sentinel chickens in Utah
leaves Oregon and Nevada as the only western states where neither probable
nor confirmed cases of West Nile virus infection have been recorded.
Note that the 2 cases reported from California are believed to have been
contracted elsewhere and are not considered to be indigenous cases. - Mod.CP]
