Specialists of the Rospotrebnadzor administration report that a rare
parasitic disease, dirofilariasis, has been registered in Udmurtia
for the 1st time this year [2009].

Dirofilariasis is caused by _Dirofilaria_, which usually parasitize
subcutaneously in different parts of the body, in mucous membranes,
and in eye conjunctiva. The infection is caused by a 5-15 cm long
roundworm [nematode].

The infection is transmitted by mosquitoes. The 1st sign of the
disease is a painful nodule. Patients feel itching and burning in the
bite area. A sensation of crawling within the consolidated skin is
considered to be a specific sign. The standard treatment is surgical
removal of the parasite from the nodule or eye.

Subcutaneous dirofilariasis is distributed in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
Georgia, Ukraine and in many oblasts of Russia, such as Astrakhan,
Volgograd, Nijegorodskiy, Saratov, Rostov, Chelyabinsk, and many
others. People usually become infected during agricultural work,
hiking, hunting and fishing in places where infected mosquitoes and
infected animals are prevalent.

Prophylactic methods include extermination of mosquitoes, timely
treatment of dogs and cats, control of wandering animals, and repellent use.

[This case reminds one about last year's (2008) ProMED-Rus report
from Kirovski oblast. The latest epidemiological research shows
increasing numbers of this rare disease in different parts of the
world. The largest number of cases have been registered in 2004 in
Rostov-on-Don. There were 14 registered cases of subcutaneous
dirofilariasis from February 2003 to July 2004; see
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/13/1/150.htm>.
- Mod.NR]

[_Dirofilaria_ cause heartworm in dogs, cats, foxes, wolves, muskrats
and otters. The human infection is usually located in the lungs but
may be found in the heart and subcutaneous tissue. Of the 11 cases
originally reported from the United States (Beaver et al. Am. J.
Trop. Med. Hyg. 1965;14:1010-29), none were located in the skin, but
a report from Japan (Nishimura et al. Biken J 1964;7:1-8) found the
worm in a subcutaneous nodule.

It is important to know the _Dirofilaria_ species causing the
infection, and methods for genotyping 6 species have been described
(Rishniw M et al. Discrimination between 6 species of canine
microfilariae by a single polymerase chain reaction. Vet Parasitol.
2006;135:303-14
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16289566?ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum>).

It is possible that the cases of cutaneous dirofilariasis are a
minority of the infected patients and that the majority, with
pulmonary or heart infections, remain undiagnosed or are being
followed under another diagnosis. For pulmonary dirofilariasis,
tuberculosis is an obvious differential diagnosis.
