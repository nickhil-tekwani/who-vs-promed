City Hall is preparing 400 000 doses of the rabies vaccine for dogs and
cats in Bangkok to prevent the spread of the disease among animals during
the hot season. The move is aimed at allaying public fears after the owner
of a pet shop at Chatuchak Weekend Market died from rabies on Sun 14 Feb
2010. The woman was a Public Health Ministry official and owner of the Take
Care Pet Shop at the market. She died from rabies after being bitten by one
of her dogs.

Apirom Puanghat, a veterinarian at the Bureau of General Communicable
Diseases, said the victim bought dogs from a pet farm in Chiang Mai
province to sell at the weekend market. She was bitten by a 3 year old
Rottweiler. The dog later died, followed by another 8 pets at the victim's
house, Dr Apirom said.

Bangkok deputy governor Malinee Sukavejworakit said 400 000 doses of the
rabies vaccine will be available free in Bangkok from next month [March
2010] to control the disease, which is prevalent among dogs and cats during
the summer. Strays will also be caught and injected, she said. Bangkok
governor Sukhumbhand Paribatra and Bangkok health authorities yesterday [20
Feb 2010] inspected pet shops at Chatuchak market.

MR Sukhumbhand said the vaccination campaign would allay public concern and
boost confidence among owners of pet shops and customers buying pets. In
the initial phase, at least 100 dogs and cats at the market would be
vaccinated and certificates issued for pets vaccinated against rabies, he
said. He said authorities will also inspect pet shops to see if they have
proper operating licenses.

MR Sukhumbhand said pet owners can also bring their dogs and cats in for
free rabies jabs at the market. Aroon Sricharoon, director of Chatuchak
market, said he would meet 300 pet shop owners to stress the importance of
acquiring operating licenses. He said those who have no licenses will be
prohibited from selling pets in the market. A penalty for violators will be
a 2000-baht [about 60 USD] fine.

Phra Maha Vichai Akkhatecho, the abbot of Wat Weluwanaram in Lampang's Mae
Tha district, where 400 abandoned dogs are looked after, said the death was
worrying. He has asked district health officials to inject the dogs at the
temple with the rabies vaccine.

So far this year [2010], 6 people have died from rabies, compared with 24
last year and 9 in 2008, according to the Public Health Ministry.

People are urged to contact the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration's
hotline 1555 or call 02-245-3311 if they suspect their pets are infected
with rabies.

[The policy of the Bankok administration in offering canine rabies vaccine
free of charge to all pet shop proprietors and domestic pet owners in the
capital is commendable and a prudent public health measure. The licensing
of pet shop owners, if rigorously enforced, should further reduce the
incidence of urban canine rabies.

More surprising is the number of human deaths recorded annually in the
capital, suggesting that prophylactic post-exposure vaccination is not
easily available or that there is a lack of awareness of the need for
immediate treatment. The fact that the victim in this incident was an
employee of the Public Health Service is both ironic and alarming. - Mod.CP
