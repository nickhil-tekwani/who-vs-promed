Outbreaks of bovine variola (poxvirus) are extremely common in several
cattle-raising areas of the south-east of the country. We have diagnosed 16
outbreaks of the disease in the last 4 years, with high levels of
morbidity both in cows and the people who milk them.
I judge that retrospective epidemiological studies are important when
outbreaks occur. In several outbreaks we have observed recurrence on the
same properties, suggesting the immunity does not last long. The sale of
animals spreads the problem. Reference laboratories interested in studying
the problem are lacking, as are places to make the differential diagnosis.
