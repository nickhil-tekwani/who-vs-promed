During January--February 2000, three pools of overwintering _Culex_ spp.
mosquitoes collected at Fort Totten, New York, were positive for West Nile
Virus (WNV) RNA by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) assay (TaqMan, Perkin-Elmer Biosystems, Foster City,
California*) (1). Additional testing to detect the presence of intact virus
was performed but was negative as of March 10, 2000. Since then, one of the
pools that was positive by RT-PCR yielded a live WNV isolate in a fluid
Vero cell culture system and confirmed by West Nile-specific monoclonal
antibody staining of virus infected cells and virus gene sequencing.
Studies of this isolate continue.

[There still are some questions to be answered and problems to be resolved.
For one, that the mosquitoes were identified as _Culex_ species suggests
the identification is not final or that the mosquitoes were in such
condition that they could not be definitely identified. Nonethless, we do
not yet know which _Culex_ spp. mosquitoes are overwintering with virus.
Probably doesn't matter much. For another, it seems odd that an isolate
would be retrieved from a mosquito pool so long after the PCR was done and
the initial isolation work done. Continued study of the isolate is a good
idea. - Mod.CHC
