--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, including Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2, were shown to be effective for COVID-19 prevention, eliciting both robust antibody responses in naive individuals and boosting pre-existing antibody levels in SARS-CoV-2-recovered individuals. However, the magnitude, repertoire, and phenotype of epitope-specific T cell responses to this vaccine, and the effect of vaccination on pre-existing T cell memory in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent patients, are still poorly understood. Thus, in this study we compared epitope-specific T cells elicited after natural SARS-CoV-2 infection, and vaccination of both naive and recovered individuals.

We collected peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after BNT162b2 vaccination and used pools of 18 DNA-barcoded MHC-class I multimers, combined with scRNAseq and scTCRseq, to characterize T cell responses to several immunodominant epitopes, including a spike-derived epitope cross-reactive to common cold coronaviruses. Comparing responses after infection or vaccination, we found that T cells responding to spike-derived epitopes show similar magnitudes of response, memory phenotypes, TCR repertoire diversity, and alphabetaTCR sequence motifs, demonstrating the potency of this vaccination platform. Importantly, in COVID-19-recovered individuals receiving the vaccine, pre-existing spike-specific memory cells showed both clonal expansion and a phenotypic shift towards more differentiated CCR7-CD45RA+ effector cells. In-depth analysis of T cell receptor repertoires demonstrates that both vaccination and infection elicit largely identical repertoires as measured by dominant TCR motifs and receptor breadth, indicating that BNT162b2 vaccination largely recapitulates T cell generation by infection for all critical parameters.

Thus, BNT162b2 vaccination elicits potent spike-specific T cell responses in naive individuals and also triggers the recall T cell response in previously infected individuals, further boosting spike-specific responses but altering their differentiation state. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of mRNA vaccines to induce, maintain, and shape T cell memory through vaccination and revaccination.

[Tweets in response to the article:

From Paul G. Thomas (@PGTimmune): "The mRNA vaccine bnt162b2 induces a strikingly potent CD8 T cell response, comparable in functionality, magnitude, memory phenotypes, and underlying TCR repertoires as infection. Vaccination after infection is able to further expand Spike-specific responses" (see full, very informative thread at https://mobile.twitter.com/PGTimmune/status/1417216638160674823).

From Shane Crotty (@profshanecrotty): "Good CD8 T cell responses to the Pfizer COVID vaccine. Nice detailed working comparing the responses to COVID infections!" Replying to @PGTimmune: "Would be really interesting to study vaccine followed by infection/exposure."

Apparently, this last suggestion is ongoing. - Mod.LK]

[2] USA: Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations
Date: Tue 20 Jul 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/gao-gives-15-new-pointers-pandemic-recovery-readiness


In its 7th report about the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES), the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) yesterday [19 Jul 2021] made 15 recommendations around topics such as program integrity and preparedness for future public health emergencies. "GAO's recommendations, if effectively implemented, can help improve the government's ongoing response and recovery efforts as well as help it to prepare for future public health emergencies," the authors write.

Previous reports have included 72 recommendations, 16 of which are fully in place right now, according to the report. The relevant government agencies have agreed with 57 of the actions, and most are in the process of being executed.

Part of the report looked at the approximately USD 484 billion that went to the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to be distributed as pandemic aid. Of the USD 324 billion given to the department via the first 5 COVID-related relief laws, 78% had been obligated and 52% had been expended. Of the USD 160 billion from the 6th law, 47% had been obligated and 2% had been expended. As of May 2021, GAO had reviewed 15 HHS spending plans (the 6th law did not require one) but found that most current plans did not include time frames for obligating the remaining funds.

GAO recommended that HHS increase communication and facilitation of the COVID relief funds by creating time frames in its spending plans when it submits them to Congress. In response, "HHS partially concurred with the recommendation and stated that the department would aim to incorporate some time frames on planned spending where that information may be available such as time frames for select grants to states," the report says.

The report also highlighted relief funds involving the Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While the Treasury was the one to allocate USD 500 billion of relief funding to states, localities, tribal governments, and other entities, the authors recommended that the Office of Management and Budget assist with the required single audits. GAO also recommended that the Treasury, in coordination with the IRS, assess and improve its outreach strategy to those who may not file with the IRS but were eligible for the direct economic impact payments (EIPs).

Back in January [2021], the Treasury had begun analyzing nearly 9 million notices it had sent to nonfilers who might be eligible for the 1st round of EIP payments, but the project wasn't set to be complete until this fall -- more than 6 months after the 3rd round of EIPs was being issued, GAO reports.

A few of GAO's other recommendations looked at the country's ability to combat future public health emergencies. For instance, the report re-emphasized a key recommendation from its January [2021] report: to engage with non-federal stakeholders and Congress and develop a supply chain strategy before the next pandemic, particularly for personal protective equipment such as respirators, masks, and gloves. Since then, however, GAO says HHS has not developed any framework to start this process.

Another example involves the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), which GAO says is currently defined as a "short-term stopgap buffer" during emergencies. Prior to the pandemic, the Office of Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) began restructuring the SNS' keeper, the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE). During this time, ASPR did not conduct SNS annual reviews from 2017 to 2019, and GAO notes that there has been a lack of documentation around restructuring choices and medical countermeasure issues, which can involve the SNS.

GAO wants more, not only asking for better records management practices in general but adding, "The [PHECME restructuring] plans should describe how ASPR will ensure a transparent and deliberative process that engages interagency partners in PHEMCE responsibilities outlined in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019, including those related to SNS annual reviews."

To try to stop future public health emergencies from escalating, GAO also makes 2 recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) around future pandemics. First, GAO suggests that the CDC work with stakeholders to have a plan for dealing with surges in laboratory testing. Second, it recommends that CDC analyze its needs for manufacturing and deploying diagnostic test kits during public health emergencies, which could result in establishing pre-emptive contracts with test kit manufacturers.

"While continuing to get 'shots in arms' remains a priority for the federal government, other important steps are needed as well to ensure the economy and the nation can fully rebound from the pandemic and be prepared for the future," said Gene L. Dodaro, comptroller general of the United States and head of the GAO, in a press release. "The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that improving the federal process for developing infectious disease testing and increasing laboratory capacity should be a top priority."

[3] UK: healthcare workers speak out
Date: Tue 20 Jul 2021 01:00 EDT
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jul/20/the-hospitals-are-very-near-to-not-coping-uk-health-workers-speak-out


On Monday [19 Jul 2021], for the 1st time since the early days of the vaccination programme in the UK, new COVID cases outnumbered the number of daily doses administered. As England lifts most restrictions, 6 healthcare workers from paramedics to paediatricians speak about what the reality is like amid rising coronavirus infections.

The paramedic, east of England: "The hospitals are very near to not coping"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's horrendous: the hospitals are very near to not coping and our ambulance service is near to declaring REAP level 4 [extreme pressure]. We are seeing a lot more COVID now with cases rising. We're taking more people into hospital who are really unwell because they've had to wait for treatment during lockdown. Their conditions could have been managed if they were seen earlier but now they're deteriorating and in the acute phase. When you hear about the lifting of restrictions, people seem to forget that it's not just about people dying of COVID: it's the cancer patients and the ones on kidney dialysis.

I totally understand people's frustrations but we're not in a good enough place. What's frightening is when the media calls us "heroes" -- that's really dangerous as heroes don't need to be protected because they don't die, but we're just humans, like everyone else. I still have night terrors of taking people away from their loved ones knowing they're going to die. I'm having therapy but quite often I think: "... I can't do this. I don't want to do this anymore." I think there's a lot of that among colleagues as mental health cases are through the roof and people can't cope.

The paediatrician, north of England: "We have seen winter levels of admissions in the emergency department"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the last few weeks we have seen winter levels of admissions in the emergency department. Modelling suggests numbers have yet to reach their peak. We're seeing mainly viral respiratory-tract infections in children, and it's expected that these numbers are going to get worse. It's because the kids normally would have been exposed to these in the winter, but they were locked down and are therefore not immune now. Another concern is rising cases of children with PIMS, which is a post-infectious viral infection that is quite rare but can be very serious, with some children needing intensive care treatment. There are also insufficient numbers of psychiatric beds for children, which means we have significant numbers of kids with mental health issues presenting in acute medical paediatric units, where they're now stuck. Overall, it's unsustainable working in this environment, and made worse with staff absences due to self-isolation. Because of such high levels of admissions, elective surgical cases are being cancelled. An elective non-urgent case will at some point become urgent if not dealt with in a timely fashion. I think the decision not to vaccinate children is reckless. They should all be offered vaccines.

The GP, Isle of Wight: "We've had families testing positive with the delta variant"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are lucky in that not a single clinical member of staff has had COVID. Since May [2021], however, we've had families testing positive with the delta variant and lots of children have had to self-isolate. We're also still working through the same backlog we had in May. Even though people are being vaccinated, it takes 3 weeks to work so I think we will continue to see the number of cases rise as restrictions ease. For us, the biggest concern is masks no longer being compulsory and getting rid of that is something we just don't feel we're ready to do. In our view it's not just a concern around COVID but viral illnesses we're seeing in children. Masks are for both patients and staff and I think we may still insist people wear them because of the healthcare setting we work in. I understand lifting restrictions in the summer as we tend to be quieter with other illnesses as we're outdoors more, but with cases rising you just question whether we should have a few more weeks to allow people's immunity to kick in. Everyone talks about the flu in winter, but we are already seeing winter illnesses in children.

The midwife, Greater Manchester: "A lot more staff are having to isolate due to family members having COVID"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm working more than 60 hours a week to cover sickness because a lot more staff are having to isolate due to family members having COVID, or they've come into contact with someone who has tested positive. We've also seen an increase in women and their partners testing positive too. We have to isolate them when that happens and we only have a certain number of side rooms that are normally for women who are septic or who have high blood loss. If cases rise to 100 000 a day then we'll have to put them in bays because there's nowhere else. I've met some women who don't want to be vaccinated as they're worried about how it might affect their baby before it's born. Most of them book in for a jab after giving birth but pregnant women are vulnerable and COVID is still a danger to them. Lifting the restrictions might be a little too much at once. There are people in hospital who have had 2 vaccinations so it's not foolproof, and the more people who catch COVID the more likely it will mutate.

The ICU nurse, London: "Right now we can manage"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We've had COVID patients throughout the year, they never stopped coming, and at all times at least one intensive care patient with COVID, though since the last peak in January [2021] a maximum of 4 at any given time. Before the younger people were offered vaccinations, we regularly had COVID patients in their 20s in the ICU.

Sadly, we're already seeing that people are slacking on taking precautions, such as washing hands and wearing face masks. They walk into the hospital not thinking about the dangers. Right now we can manage, but we do wonder: "will it go off the charts again?". I will certainly still be wearing face masks and hope people will continue being cautious. I hope people will be sensible in public, stay at home when unwell -- even if it's just a cold -- and keep on getting vaccinated. I'm quite apprehensive about the winter.

The cardiac physiologist, Birmingham: "Lots of patients with long COVID have been referred to us"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lots of patients with long COVID have been referred to us to see if it's affected their heart. We don't know much about it and we want to see if it has an effect on other parts of their bodies, not just their lungs. Referrals have increased as services that were closed have now reopened. Some patients stayed at home with their problems and were too scared to go to hospital or see their GP. Only now are they being referred for all these tests and that's why we're seeing an increase. I think the lifting of restrictions is difficult. The number of cases in the community is going up, so on paper it doesn't seem like the right time. My main worry is people travelling. While we might be safe here, we don't want to bring variants from other parts of the world, especially if other countries have not had such good vaccine programmes. We've got a responsibility not just nationally but globally to tackle it.

[4] Vaccine
[4A] USA: mandates
Date: Tue 20 Jul 2021 08:00 EDT
Source: Bloomberg News [edited]
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-20/vaccine-mandates-protect-people-and-speed-the-pandemic-recovery


In much of America, vaccine hesitancy has turned into vaccine defiance. Several states have banned or are considering banning demands by businesses that people show proof of vaccination. Tennessee -- where only 38% of adults are fully inoculated and the COVID-19 caseload is growing fast -- has gone so far as to cancel public schools' efforts to encourage eligible children to get their shots (including flu shots). For good measure, the state has fired its medical director for vaccine programs.

These actions make it harder to protect the public from COVID-19 as the highly infectious delta variant spreads. States should instead be issuing their own vaccine passports and requiring healthcare workers to be vaccinated -- as President Emmanuel Macron has done in France. President Joe Biden should go beyond cajoling the vaccine-hesitant and call on hospitals and nursing homes across the USA to insist that their employees get their shots.

The healthcare industry is the best place to start issuing vaccine mandates. A handful of hospital systems have already imposed them -- and proved they work. The Houston Methodist system, the 1st [hospital system] to act, retained all but 153 of its 26 000 employees as it pushed its vaccination rate from 85% to 100% (with about 600 staffers allowed medical or religious exemptions). A lawsuit brought by employees wanting to work unvaccinated failed.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has confirmed that employers have the authority to require that their workers be vaccinated -- even though COVID-19 vaccines still have only emergency-use approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As the FDA works on granting full approval by the end of summer [2021], hospitals and nursing homes should move ahead with mandates, as epidemiologists and infectious disease doctors have urged.

Many colleges and universities are also demanding that students, faculty and staff be vaccinated. On Monday [19 Jul 2021] a federal judge upheld Indiana University's mandate. Some banks are requiring employees to disclose their vaccination status. Morgan Stanley has told its workers to get their shots or stay home. It makes sense for companies of all kinds to allow only vaccinated employees to work alongside others.

The USA has made impressive progress toward defeating COVID-19. Although not quite 60% of adults are fully vaccinated, almost 80% of those over 65 are. So even as the delta variant spreads, the most vulnerable are well protected. Because COVID tends to be less severe in younger adults and children, rising caseloads pose less risk than before of overwhelming hospitals. Even so, cases are rising (up 70% over the past week) and so are hospital admissions and deaths (up 36% and 26%, respectively). The surge is occurring almost entirely among the unvaccinated.

To discourage people from their getting their shots is unconscionable. But it's no longer good enough to simply call on the vaccine-hesitant to protect themselves and others. Hospitals, schools and businesses are within their rights to insist on vaccinations -- and ought to be doing just that.

[It seems uncanny to bring politics so deeply into public health. The concept of public health likely needs to be taught in high school, if not earlier, so students can understand and teach their recalcitrant parents. The only way out of this pandemic is through this understanding the need for vaccination. If this can be achieved only through vaccine mandates, then it seems important to implement them. - Mod.LK]

France's vaccination rollout is accelerating after President Emmanuel Macron announced that "health passes" -- showing proof of testing or immunization -- will be required in restaurants and cafes. A Health Ministry official said at a briefing that 4.3 million injections were administered last week, including 1.7 million 1st doses. In another record, 880 000 shots were administered on Friday [16 Jul 2021]. And this week saw the best Monday [19 Jul 2021] of the rollout, the official said.

French vaccinations are proceeding twice as much fast as the rollouts in Italy and Germany, the official said. After Macron's speech, the number of online vaccine appointments climbed to 520 000 daily from 140 000 daily in early July [2021]. France will reach its target of 40 million 1st doses ahead of schedule, the official said.
