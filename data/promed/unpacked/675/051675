The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of Arizona, California, and Nevada. These
declarations allow USDA to apply federal authority within Arizona,
California and Nevada.
* Sequencing results have confirmed 2 new infected commercial premises in
San Diego County, CA.
* Currently there are 15 commercial flocks in the State of California
affected by END.The breakdown of the commercial premises involved is as
follows:4 premises in Riverside County (3 infected and 1 contact), 4
counties in San Diego County (4 infected), and 7 premises in San Bernardino

* Of the 2018 premises designated for depopulation, 87.6 percent have been
completed.
* The Central Valley Incident Command Post in Modesto, CA, is staffed and
working cooperatively with approximately 15) 20 county officials to
implement efficient surveillance measures throughout the Central Valley.
The Agriculture Multi-Agency Coordination (AgMAC) Group met on 12 Feb 2003,
to discuss interagency agreements and agency resource allocations.The AgMAC
is scheduled to have a follow-up meeting on 26 Feb 2003, and will meet
weekly to address issues as they emerge.
Once affected premises are identified and birds humanely depopulated,
affected areas are being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Landfills,
composting, and rendering are being used for safe disposal of affected
birds and materials.
Task Force personnel are conducting a door-to-door campaign to identify
affected premises. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. Entities
that sell birds continue to be monitored in affected areas. If a flock
tests positive, officials will quarantine the premises immediately and
order the destruction of the flock as soon as it is logistically possible.
Task Force personnel, in close collaboration with the California State
Highway Patrol, are exploring the possibility of establishing inspection
stations on Interstate 5. Personnel are also discussing border control and
voluntary compliance issues.
APHIS has developed and distributed a plan to enhance national END
surveillance.This plan will enhance the already extensive surveillance
underway in Arizona, California, and Nevada.
CDFA's Division of Fairs and Expositions has issued an official
recommendation that the California Fairs Boards adopt a local policy to
suspend all poultry shows for the 2003 fair season.

airing on both Spanish- and English-language television stations in
Southern California.The announcements encourage citizens to report any sick
or dying birds.

stations in the greater southern California radio market area. Public
