In Medvenskiy district, in the faraway village of Aksyonovka [no region
given a calf died of anthrax. Its owner and relatives divided up the
carcass and took it to the "livestock grave" [skotomogil'nik. Then the
owner became ill. The diagnosis of anthrax, cutaneous form, was confirmed
by the laboratory of the regional infectious disease hospital. Three people
were hospitalized. The village is under quarantine.

[The Medvenskiy district is in the Kursk Oblast that is close to the
Russia-Ukranian border. We had to delay posting until we were able to
locate this obscure part of Russia. Calves very rarely die of anthrax on
their own, especially in mid-summer; this is a disease primarily of adult
stock. So this is either a journalistic error or there were further
unreported deaths.
