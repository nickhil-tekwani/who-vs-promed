Neurologic EHV-1 confirmed in California horse
----------------------------------------------
A 15-year-old Oldenburg mare from Sonoma County, California, tested
positive for the neurologic strain of equine herpesvirus-1 yesterday
(23 Aug 2011), according to a statement from the California Department
of Food and Agriculture (CDFA).

The mare has been quarantined and is currently undergoing treatment at
a veterinary referral hospital, the statement relayed. The mare's home
farm is currently under veterinary observation and potentially exposed
horses are being monitored closely, having their temperatures checked
twice daily.

"Epidemiologic investigation conducted by the CDFA reveals minimum
disease risk based on lack of animal movement on and off the affected
premises," the statement noted.

Although it's not transmissible to humans, EHV-1 is highly contagious
among horses and camelids, and it is generally passed from horse to
horse via aerosol transmission (when affected animals sneeze/cough)
and contact with nasal secretions. The disease can cause a variety of
ailments in equines, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease
usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and
myeloencephalopathy (EHM -- equine herpes myeloencephalopathy -- the
neurologic form). Myeloencephalopathy is characterized by fever,
ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs, and
incontinence.

Further, the CDFA indicated that this case has "no direct link" to the
widespread EHV-1 outbreak that took place in the western United States
and Canada in May and June of this year [2011]. TheHorse.com will
continue to provide updates on the situation as more information
becomes available.
