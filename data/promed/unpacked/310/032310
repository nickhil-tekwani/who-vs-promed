[We are grateful for the new information in light of the situation in
Jordan -- see reference below. Of course, it will again be helpful to
know the serotype from both outbreaks in Lebanon as the report
indicates that sheep and goats were vaccinated with type O and did
not get sick in the area of Zahle suburb, Al Biqa, where the dairy
cattle outbreak occurred.
The regular follow-up information from the Palestinian Autonomous
Territories indicating the continued circulation of foot-and-mouth
disease serotype O is also very helpful in putting together a
complete picture of the foot-and-mouth disease situation in the
region, especially as multiple animal health officials are attempting
to control at least 2 serotypes in different types of ruminant
populations. - Mod.PC]
