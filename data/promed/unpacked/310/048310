Measles cases increase by nearly 700 per cent in Kano
----------------------------------------------------
LAGOS: The number of measles infections in Kano, northern Nigeria's biggest
city, in the first 21 weeks of 2001 was 670 per cent higher than in the
same period in 2000 (16 263 cases/2111), Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF)
said on Tue 22 May 2001. The statement was based on the results of MSF
research at 2 hospitals in Kano and of a joint surveillance by MSF and Kano
State's Ministry of Health. This is an indication of a general rise in the
incidence of measles in most of northern Nigeria.
"Cases of measles have been rising since November last year," stated Dr
Gebrewold Petros, medical coordinator of MSF in Nigeria. "They have started
dropping now." MSF did not provide fatality figures, but local newspapers
quoting health officials from different parts of northern Nigeria suggest
that the disease [has also claimed more lives. Cases of measles usually
increase during the dry, hot season, from November to May. They generally
drop with the onset of the rainy season. [The reverse might have been
expected, since measles is transmitted by aerosol. Presumably this pattern
is determined by social factors such as school terms, etc. - Mod.CP Petros
said it was not yet possible to say why the incidence of the disease had
risen dramatically this year. He said all those now fighting the epidemic
would take part in a study into the reasons for the increase.
Local and international medical workers involved in immunisation in parts
of Nigeria's north have reported some resistance to vaccination by local
people this year. They have attributed it to suspicions fuelled by some
radical groups in the area, [which have alleged that the vaccines were
either tainted with HIV or were meant to sterilise people as part of an
alleged Western conspiracy to control African population growth.

[This article is being posted as a reminder that measles remains a
significant problem in Africa, where vaccination programs still have not
achieved the high levels of coverage maintained in other regions. (In
contrast, the occurrence of one case in Mexico resulted in an international
debate, and 2 cases in El Salvador resulted in a multi-country alert.)
While mortality figures are not mentioned in this article, mortality rates
of 20 per cent or more have been seen in many African countries, where
measles tends to be a more severe disease, especially in malnourished
people. - Mod.MPP
