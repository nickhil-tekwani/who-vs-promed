Hepatitis C could be decreased with better screening
Better screening of blood and organ donors could prevent transmission of
hepatitis C, the World Health Organization said Friday. The disease is a
spreading viral infection already estimated to affect 170 million
people. The United Nations agency also said that there was growing data
on links between the infectious disease and cancer. There is no vaccine
for hepatitis C, first identified in 1989, although an experimental
vaccine is being used in preliminary clinical trials, according to WHO.
New infections continue to occur because of unscreened blood
transfusions, failure to sterilize hospital and injection equipment and
unprotected sexual intercourse." WHO said it was estimated that about 80
per cent of acutely infected patients progress to chronic hepatitis,
that about 20 per cent of these chronic infections develop cirrhosis,
and that one to five percent of cirrhotic patients would develop liver
cancer in the next 10 years.
CDPC Note: This is yet another example of a relatively "silent" epidemic
that is being neglected by the international health community to the
point that it is almost a case of public health malpractice. Everyone
will begin jumping on the hepatitis C prevention bandwagon when the
epidemics of liver diseases related to this agent cannot be ignored.
However, by then it will be too late for hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of persons who are being and will be infected in developing
countries because of the general lack of adequate screening of their
blood supplies for hepatitis C. All countries who are now screening for
HIV in their blood bank system should also be "required" to screen for
hepatitis C.
