RICE BLAST - USA (CALIFORNIA)

Sacramento, California - The California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the
California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) have issued a joint
agreement to allow rice growers to burn limited additional acreage of crops
infected with a devastating disease called rice blast. [Rice blast is a
disease caused by the fungus _Pyricularia grisea_ (Cooke) Sacc. - Mod.PKA].
The action is being taken to prevent the spread of the infestation and
protect the state's 508,000 acres of rice from further infestation. The
infestation has affected 867 fields in 58,000 acres in parts of Glenn,
Colusa and Sutter counties [in north central California, north of
Sacramento - PKA].
In October 1996, rice blast was found for the first time in California in
8,000 acres of Glenn and Colusa counties and a burn agreement was
instituted to lessen the chance of crop devastation. This year's burn
agreement allows Glenn County to burn up to 8,000 acres, 11,600 acres in
Colusa County and 3,400 in Sutter County.
The state will continue to pursue measures to control the further spread of
this disease. These include: additional information and education outreach
to the public and rice industry; the destruction of rice stubble and straw
located in adjacent fields exposed to the infestation; cleaning of rice
harvesters and other harvesting equipment; allow the planting of only
certified seeds and use seed treatments to prevent an further
contamination; avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization; and continued
efforts to monitor rice fields for signs of additional outbreaks. The
disease affects production and yield.
Experts believe that the infestation in California may be associated with
the combination of high temperatures and high humidity which occurred in
the area in the past year. These are the weather conditions found in the
southeast United States and Asia, where the disease is more common.

Resources Board, 916-322-2990.
