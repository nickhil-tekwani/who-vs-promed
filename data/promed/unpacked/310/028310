[The previous case of equine piroplasmosis in Finland was detected in June 2020. According to the epidemiological comments: "The horse was imported from Portugal approximately 2 years ago. Positive results for _Babesia caballi_ and _Theileria equi_were obtained by PCR, and the horse is receiving treatment". The event was resolved, see final report at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=28068.

"Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal disease of horses, mules, donkeys and zebra. The aetiological agents are blood parasites named _Theileria equi_ and _Babesia caballi_. _Theileria equi_was previously designated as _Babesia equi_. Infected animals may remain carriers of these parasites for long periods and act as sources of infection for ticks, which act as vectors.

"The introduction of carrier animals into areas where tick vectors are prevalent can lead to an epizootic spread of the disease.

"The parasites occur in southern Europe, Asia, countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa, Cuba, South and Central America, and certain parts of the southern United States of America. _T. equi_ has also been reported from Australia (but, apparently never established itself in this region), and is now believed to have a wider general distribution than _B. caballi_.
