New outbreaks

[A total of 8 outbreaks are covered in this follow-up report (which
we have abridged), of which 3 in sheep holdings, 2 in cattle
holdings, 2 in mixed sheep and cattle holdings (both species
affected), and 1 in a dairy goats operation. All 3 species showed
clinical signs, including mortalities. The place names of the
outbreaks, detailed information on the number of cases, deaths, etc.,
in each of them can be accessed in the original OIE report at the
above URL. The report includes also a map showing the respective 8
locations which are to be seen spread throughout the entire territory
of Israel. - Mod.AS]

[The total, accumulated number of BTV outbreaks in Israel during
Oct/Nov 2008, reported in the immediate notification of 10 Dec 2008
(item 3 above) and the follow-up report No 1 of 20 Jan 2009 (item 2),
is 10, of which 5 in sheep holdings, 2 in cattle holdings, 2 in mixed
sheep and cattle holdings, and 1 in a dairy goat operation. Clinical
disease and mortality in Israeli cattle and goats is highly unusual.
Although sporadic BT cases in cattle (mostly involving fattening
young bulls) have been seen in the past, they were rare and
exceptional. Clinical BT in goats is extremely rare in Israel. Indeed
a major outbreak of EHD, which cannot be clinically differentiated
from BT, was reported in Israeli cattle in 2006; but according to the
results of the Kimron Veterinary Institute reported in the immediate
notification, and of the OIE reference laboratory in Pirbright,
reported in the follow-up report, samples from cattle have now been
identified as BTV, though serotyping seems to be pending. This may exclude EHD.

The report mentions, among "applied control measures," "vaccination
in response to the outbreak." Since the only BTV vaccine currently
available in Israel is an inactivated bivalent BTV2/BTV4 vaccine
(manufactured in Europe), the efficacy of such vaccine to protect
susceptible animals (which may now include cattle on top of sheep)
against the current causative agent, is questionable. BTV2 and BTV4,
both endemic and long familiar in Israel, would have already been
identified if present in the tested samples.

An early completion of the serotyping, potentially enabling the
purchase (or, if unavailable, the production) of a homologous
inactivated vaccine, is to be wishfully anticipated. Could this be
achieved sufficiently ahead of the 2009 BT season? - Mod.AS]
