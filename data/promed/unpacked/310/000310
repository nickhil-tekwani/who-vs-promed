A 2nd case of [classical] swine fever [CSF] was detected in Gifu Prefecture on Fri [16 Nov 2018] at a park, after the nation's 1st case in decades was reported in September [2018] at a nearby pig farm. The Gifu Prefectural Government culled all 21 pigs kept at the Chikusan Center Park (Livestock Center Park) after confirming earlier in the morning through tests that 2 of them were infected with what is also known as hog cholera. The virus affects only pigs and wild boars and has an almost 100 per cent fatality rate.

Already 49 wild boars in the prefecture have been found to be infected with the virus, and 2 of them were found in the park in late September 2018. But the pigs in the park had shown no signs of infection at that time, according to the prefecture. The park said it will close until 25 Nov 2018 due to disinfection and epidemic control work.

Farm minister Takamori Yoshikawa urged all prefectures to take measures to prevent wild boars from entering pig farms, deeming them to be the cause of the outbreak. Eight Gifu pig farms near the affected park have been banned from shipping their pigs and meat outside the area.

Following the CSF infection at a Gifu farm just 8 km southeast of the park in September 2018, Japan suspended exports of pork and related products from across the country. But the ban on shipments had been lifted for some markets after individual negotiations, and Tokyo does not plan to stop exports to those destinations following the latest case, according to farm ministry officials.

CSF does not affect humans even if an infected animal is consumed. The nation's pork exports totalled around one billion yen (USD 9 million) last year [2017]. Prior to this year's [2018] outbreak, Japan had only seen cases of CSF in 1992 and had declared the virus eradicated in 2007.

[Japan submitted its most recent report to the OIE addressing CSF, follow-up report No 4, on 9 Oct 2018. OIE's summary of the event, as of 9 Oct 2018, including epidemiological comments, follows:

"Total outbreaks = 18 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Swine / 610 / 29 / 29 / 581 / 0
Wild boar / - / 19 / 12 / 7 / 0

"Epidemiological comments
(1) Removal of movement restriction zone (MRZ):
On 00:00 of 10 Oct 2018, movement restrictions, which were established within 3 km radius of the affected farm, were lifted as 28 days have passed after the completion of full implementation of control measures (stamping out, disinfection etc.) in the affected farm.
(2) Wild boars reported in this follow-up report:
Nine wild boars were found within a 10 km radius of the affected farm, 7 of them are live-captured and 2 were found dead. The local government of Gifu Prefecture confirmed all of the cases as CSF positive by PCR.
(3) Summary of the wild boar surveillance:
As of 10 Oct 2018, 130 wild boars in Gifu Prefecture have been tested and found that 19 are positive and the rest (111) are negative (*).
Among the other prefectures, 68 wild boars in 29 prefectures were tested and all found to be negative (**).
(*): Gifu prefecture has been conducting CSF testing of dead/captured wild boars since 13 Sep 2018.
(**): All reported dead wild boars are subjected to CSF testing since 14 Sep 2018."

According to the Japan Times media report above, dated 16 Nov 2018, "already 49 wild boars in the prefecture have been found to be infected with the virus"; this may mean that, on top of the 19 reported, 30 additional CSF-infected wild boar have been identified since 9 Oct 2018.

A new, 5th follow-up report, addressing the new outbreak on the Chikusan (Livestock) Center Park and the added wild boars, is expected soon.

Hopefully, the limited CSF event in Japan, involving, so far, 2 small pig farms and 49 wild boars in a restricted zone, will not become a prelude to the introduction of African swine fever from China. Accumulated experience and increased alertness will support Japan's preparedness. - Mod.AS
