Tackling cattle deaths in Dharmapuri
------------------------------------
A total of 5 more milch animals fell victim to the foot and mouth
disease [FMD] that is spreading rampantly in Boomathanahalli in
Karimanglam Union [Map at
<http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Dharmapuri&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=37.410045,77.34375&ie=UTF8&ll=21.166484,79.101563&spn=5.509697,9.667969&z=6&om=0>].
The disease claimed more than 22 lives of the cattle since Sunday [2
Sep 2007]. [What was the denominator?! - Mod.AS]
The farmers of Pulikkal, Elangalappatti, Ulagankottai and
Boomathanahalli, who lost their cattle to the disease, were
approached by the district administration in this connection.
The Dharmapuri district administration ordered the Animal Husbandry
Department to deploy medical teams to administer vaccines to the
cattle in the affected villages. Even then, a few more deaths of
cattle were reported in Boomathanahalli village.
Two milch animals belonging to farmers Venkatesan and Krishnan and 3
animals of P Krishnan, K Shanmugam and R Ganesan of the same village
reportedly died of the disease.

[FMD is endemic in India and mass vaccinations are carried out
annually. When a disease is regarded endemic in a country, the
country is not required by the OIE to report each outbreak. The
occurrence is included in semi-annual reports only.
According to the data available at the website of the FMD World
Reference laboratory, Pirbright, the following FMDV Serotypes were
the last ones reported from India: O, Asia 1, C (1996), A. (see
source at <http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/ind.htm>).
We decided to post this item in view of the alleged high mortality
which may be exceptional in case adult animals are involved, and to
encourage laboratory involvement. If FMD is confirmed, the serotype
of the pathogen and the immune status of the affected farms should be
determined. In case the suspected FMD diagnosis not be confirmed,
further investigations should be undertaken to obtain a final
diagnosis. - Mod.AS]
