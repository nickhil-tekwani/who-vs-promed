Tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] have been found in 10 different locations in the Netherlands this year [2020], while yellow fever mosquitoes have been found twice, broadcaster RTL Nieuws reported on Friday [20 Nov 2020].

Tiger mosquitoes were found at locations all over the country, including Lelystad, Haarlemmermeer and Breda. They can carry yellow fever and dengue fever in their native habitat and were first sighted in the Netherlands in 2005.

In Assen and Lelystad, the arrival of foreign mosquitos is linked to used car tyre import companies, but they are also found in imported bamboo plants, RTL said.

The figures come from the Dutch product safety board NVWA information, which does not state how many mosquitoes were found. Last year [2019], for example, 350 tiger mosquitoes were found in Valkenburg, RTL Nieuws said.

[This is not the 1st time that _Aedes albopictus_ has been found in the Netherlands. In 2010, eggs and larvae of this mosquito were found in imported used tires in Brabant. In 2013, they were found in Oss, Weert, Montfort, Almere, Lelystad, Emmeloord, and Harderberg but were eliminated (see ProMED-mail Aedes albopictus - Netherlands 20130817.1885955). They were present in 2018 in Eindhoven, Weert, Amstelveen, Assen, and Almere and now in 10 locations this year (2020). It is very unlikely that _Ae. albopictus_ is sufficiently abundant to permit ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, or Zika viruses should they be introduced by travelers from countries where the viruses are currently being transmitted. Nevertheless, elimination of these mosquitoes is prudent.

One does not know if the eggs of _Ae. albopictus_ found in various localities are capable of going into physiologically inactive diapause and survive winter temperatures. The Netherlands has a maritime climate, and winter temperatures may not fall much below 0 deg C (32 deg F). _Ae. albopictus_ can survive in considerably colder conditions, such as those in the Midwestern states of the USA. Although this mosquito is present now in these localities in the Netherlands, it is not considered to have become established there. A map of the distribution of this mosquito in Europe shows that it has become established in southern Europe but not in northern Europe as of September 2020 (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/aedes-albopictus-current-known-distribution-september-2020). - Mod.TY
