[1] Control measures addressing wild boar along the border with North Korea

South Korea has ordered hundreds of soldiers manning the demilitarised zone (DMZ) on its border with North Korea to track and capture wild boars in a bid to prevent the spread of African swine fever [ASF], military officials said.

South Korea confirmed its 7th case on Thursday [26 Sep 2019], just over a week after the virus was 1st detected, and prompted authorities to step up disinfection measures.

The source of the outbreak has not been confirmed, but the virus has been found on hog farms near the border with North Korea, which reported an outbreak in May [2019] to the world body in charge of fighting animal diseases.

Troops and equipment normally used to guard against North Korean provocations were deployed this summer to monitor and trap wild boars suspected of carrying the virus, a South Korean military official told Reuters.

"We can't shoot them because it would be a violation of the armistice agreement," the official said, referring to the 1953 pact with the North that halted fighting but did not end the war and has governed the border ever since.

The border, decades after the 1950-53 Korean War, is laced with landmines, razor wire, and high-tech surveillance equipment. The 250 km [155 mi] DMZ is also home to wild animals that thrive in the wooded no-man's land.

The animals may be deterred by fences and other barriers along the DMZ, the military official added.

The US-led United Nations Command (UNC), which helps oversee the DMZ, is not involved in containing the virus, the official said. The UNC did not respond to a request for comment.

The efforts against the highly contagious disease, which is fatal to pigs but does not affect humans, have taken on new urgency as more cases are reported.

The wild boars trapped by the military have tested negative for ASF, the military official said. Two boars found dead in the DMZ had also tested negative, the defence ministry said.

South Korea has deployed 1173 military personnel and 166 decontamination vehicles to 7 areas, deputy defence ministry spokesman Roh Jae-cheon said on Thursday [26 Sep 2019].

"There have been no cases of wild boars crossing the border from North to South within the DMZ," he told a news briefing. "No attempt was made to enter general outposts, and no boars have been shot dead inside the DMZ."

More than 300 South Korean soldiers and 40 decontamination trucks were deployed along roads and checkpoints near the border on Thursday [26 Sep 2019] to control the spread of the virus, Roh said.

South Korea has been disinfecting people, cars, and equipment at a liaison office jointly run with the North in the border city of Kaesong, said an official at the Unification Ministry, which handles cross-border ties.

DMZ "peace trails" used by hikers have also been closed.

[North Korea submitted its immediate notification on ASF on 30 May 2019, indicating 23 May 2019 as "start of outbreak" and 25 May 2019 as date of confirmation; no follow-up report nor other official information have become available since then (see ProMED-mail post 20190530.6494781 and https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=30664). - Mod.AS]

[2] FAO weekly Asia ASF update, 26 Sep 2019
Date: Thu 26 Sep 2019
Source: FAO/EMPRES -- Animal Health: ASF Asia weekly update for 26 Sep 2019 [abridged, edited]
http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/Situation_update.html [to be published on website soon]


South Korea [selected]
1. Situation update: Since the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs [MAFRA], confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak on 17 Sep 2019, a total of 7 ASF outbreaks were reported in Gyeonggi-Do (4) and Incheon City (3), and 3 more are suspected in Yangju-Si and Yeoncheon-Gun in Gyeonggi-Do, and Incheon City. More than 10 000 pigs have died or been destroyed due to the ASF.

2. Actions taken by the Republic of Korea
MAFRA issued a nationwide standstill order from 24 Sep 12:00 until 28 Sep 12:00 [2019] to carry out extensive disinfection at farms and livestock-related facilities. The prime minister presided at a pan-government meeting on 24 Sep 2019 16:00 and, recognising measures taken were not enough, ordered pre-emptive actions beyond existing manuals and asked all governments, local governments, farms, agricultural cooperatives, unions, and residents to respond in full force.

Four key control areas have been designated: North Gyeonggi province (10 cities, counties including Yeoncheon, Pocheon, Dongducheon, Yangju, Paju, Goyang, Gimpo, Ganghwa, Ongjin, Cheorwon); North Gangwon province (4 cities, counties including Hwacheon, Yanggu, Inje, and Goseong); Southern Gyeonggi province (the remaining 20 cities and counties); and South Gangwon province (13 remaining cities, counties).

In the areas, movement of pig and manure is allowed only within the zone; a veterinarian's clinical examination is required before moving pigs in the areas; private veterinarians in the 4 zones are mobilized to support clinical inspection; and pork meat can be moved to other zones after slaughter. In addition, [there is] a nationwide ban of swill feeding and [restriction of] entry of veterinarians, personnel from feed company, etc. to pig farms in Gyeonggi-Gangwon area, except for the purpose of treating the sick animals.

[It remains to hope that the severe control measures described above have been timely undertaken, enabling the South Korean veterinary authorities to attain the same good results they attained when handling the 2018 FMD serotype A event, similarly close to the northwest border region, in March-April 2018. The event started 26 Mar 2018 and was declared resolved 30 Apr 2018, affecting a total of 2 swine farms.
