Interim Guidance on the Use of Antiviral Medications for Treatment of Human Infections with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Human Disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document provides guidance for antiviral treatment of human infection with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease; these viruses currently include influenza A (H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus.

This guidance merges and replaces the previously posted guidance on the use of antiviral agents for treatment of human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) and avian influenza A (H5N1). This antiviral treatment guidance is consistent with current CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, and provides updated recommendations for treatment of novel influenza A infections associated with severe human disease in the United States.

This guidance reflects recently updated novel influenza A case definitions (see H7N9 case definitions [http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h7n9/case-definitions.htm] and H5N1 case definitions [http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/h5n1/case-definitions.htm]). This guidance recommends antiviral treatment as soon as possible for all hospitalized cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease, and for confirmed and probable outpatient cases. Outpatient cases under investigation who have had recent close contact with a confirmed or probable case of human infection with a novel influenza A virus that can cause severe disease should receive follow-up antiviral treatment, whereas outpatient cases under investigation meeting only the travel exposure criteria for a case under investigation are not recommended to receive antiviral treatment. (For guidance on investigation of close contacts of confirmed or probable cases, see [2] below: Interim Guidance on Follow-up of Close Contacts of Persons Infected with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Human Disease and the Use of Antiviral Medications for Chemoprophylaxis [http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/novel-av-chemoprophylaxis-guidance.htm].)

These recommendations are based on expert opinion and available published and unpublished data on the treatment of infection caused by influenza viruses, including seasonal, pandemic, and novel viruses. This guidance will continue to be updated as additional information on virus transmissibility, epidemiology, and antiviral susceptibility patterns becomes available for novel influenza A viruses that cause severe disease. ...

[2015 is striking in the sharp increase in human cases of A(H5N1) in Egypt, as posted in ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (89): WHO update, Egypt, H5N1 20150409.3287821. The case-fatality rate (CFR) following infection with this virus spans a broad range, from 10 per cent to 75 per cent, with an overall CFR of 33.9 per cent.

Similarly, human cases of A(H7N9) have been increasing. In total, there have been 3 waves described of A(H7N9) activity in China, with 656 cases in humans since it was 1st detected there in the spring of 2013. A description of these waves can be found in Liu Y et al. The Third Wave: H7N9 Endemic Reassortant Viruses and Patient Clusters. J Infect Dev Ctries 2015; 9(2):122-127. doi:10.3855/jidc.6759 (http://www.jidc.org/index.php/journal/article/view/25699485/1244). To date, the greatest number of cases was observed in January 2014 during the 2nd wave. An informative map of the distribution of cases in China during the 3rd wave can be accessed at https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zM8zoioYlQg0.kV_Uo7mb0Zwg.

Most of these infections have been associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets). The risk to travelers, as well as residents, in China and Egypt, as well as other countries with novel avian influenza strains circulating, increases with the increase in activity in poultry.

In January 2015, 2 Canadian travelers were diagnosed with the 1st 2 imported cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) in North America after having visited China (http://who.int/csr/don/01-february-2015-avian-influenza/en/). 1 year earlier, in January 2014, Canada reported the 1st case of human infection with avian influenza A (H5N1) virus ever detected in the Americas (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/news/first-human-h5n1-americas.htm). While human infection with novel avian influenza viruses is rare, H5N1 and H7N9 may result in serious illness with very high mortality. Therefore, CDC has proactively moved forward with interim guidance on the use of antiviral medications for treatment. - Mod.LK]

[2] CDC interim guidance on follow-up of contacts of novel influenza A cases

Interim Guidance on Follow-up of Close Contacts of Persons Infected with Novel Influenza A Viruses Associated with Severe Human Disease and on the Use of Antiviral Medications for Chemoprophylaxis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This document provides guidance for follow-up and antiviral chemoprophylaxis of close contacts of cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease, which currently includes avian influenza A (H7N9) virus and highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. This guidance merges previously posted guidance on the use of antiviral agents for chemoprophylaxis of human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) and avian influenza A (H5N1).

This interim guidance is based on expert opinion and currently available published and unpublished data for antiviral treatment and chemoprophylaxis of seasonal, pandemic, and novel influenza. These recommendations are based on the following considerations:
- Novel influenza A viruses have caused severe human disease and substantial mortality among detected cases to date.
- Limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission cannot be excluded in some case clusters.
- Sufficient supplies of antiviral agents that are expected to be effective against novel influenza A viruses are available.

The public health goal of this interim guidance is to prevent further spread of novel influenza A viruses associated with severe human disease if there is introduction/travel of infected persons into the United States. It is specific to a scenario where there are sporadic cases associated with poultry exposure and possible limited, non-sustained human-to-human virus transmission.

This guidance will be updated as additional information on epidemiology and transmissibility becomes available for novel influenza A viruses causing severe human disease.

Definition of Close Contacts
----------------------------
Close contacts are defined as persons within approximately 6 feet (2 meters) or within the room or care area of a confirmed or probable novel influenza A case patient for a prolonged period of time, or with direct contact with infectious secretions while the case patient was likely to be infectious (beginning 1 day prior to illness onset and continuing until resolution of illness).

In general, decisions to initiate antiviral chemoprophylaxis should be guided by the risk stratification described below, based on observational data for reported cases of human infections with H7N9 and H5N1 viruses, and on data from seasonal influenza studies.
1. Highest-risk exposure groups (recognized risk of transmission)
- Household or close family member contacts of a confirmed or probable case
2. Moderate-risk exposure groups (unknown risk of transmission)
- Health care personnel with unprotected close contact with a confirmed or probable case
3. Low-risk exposure groups (transmission unlikely)
- Others who have had social contact of a short duration with a confirmed or probable case in a non-hospital setting (e.g., in a community or workplace environment)

Persons with an unprotected exposure to novel influenza A virus associated with severe human disease in a laboratory setting may have a high-risk or moderate-risk exposure, and need to be evaluated case by case. ... [more]

[To date, minimal transmission to contacts of cases has been suspected, as the avian influenza viruses are not transmitted easily from person to person. But because of the number of strains circulating in the environment, and the level of activity in poultry, reassortment presents a real threat, as does mutation in the viral genome, that may facilitate such a mode of transmission. Genetic changes have been observed in A(H5N1) that are of concern (see ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (81): genetic changes H5N1 20150402.3274191), as well as in H7N9 (http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/11/us-health-china-birdflu-idUSKBN0M727420150311). But the changes are not necessarily associated with increasing potential to create a pandemic strain. Nonetheless, along with monitoring the strains of avian influenza that are circulating, guidance on treatment of cases and protocols for follow-up of persons who have had contact with cases is timely. - Mod.LK]

CHP notified of additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Mainland
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (10 Apr 2015) received notification of 13 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) with onset of symptoms between 14 Feb 2015 and 21 Mar 2015 from the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The patients comprise 9 men and 4 women aged 32 to 80 and 3 of them (2 men and 1 woman) died. 10 cases are from Zhejiang [province], 2 are from Fujian [province] and 1 is from Shandong [province].

To date, 633 cases of human H7N9 infection have been reported by the Mainland health authorities cumulatively since 2013. In the 3rd wave since November 2014, 193 cases have been reported in the Mainland, including 72 cases in Guangdong, 39 cases in Fujian, 38 cases in Zhejiang, 17 cases in Jiangsu, 7 cases in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 7 cases in Anhui, 6 cases in Shanghai, 2 cases in Hunan, 2 cases in Jiangxi, 2 cases in Shandong and 1 case in Guizhou.

[An attachment to the report above shows the geographic distribution of cases in Guangdong province.

There are actually only 3 additional cases -- from Fujian and Shandong provinces -- that have not been reported previously. See ProMED-mail post Avian influenza, human (87): China (ZJ) H7N9, China (HK) alert status 20150408.3285269 and earlier avian influenza human China postings for those cases already reported. The total number of cases in China according to FluTrackers (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links is now 656.
