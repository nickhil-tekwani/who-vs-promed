The lone star tick advances into New Hampshire and Maine
-----------------------------------------------
A handful of Lone Star ticks are finding their
way into New Hampshire and Maine from points further south.
The ticks, which are named for a small white spot
on their backs, used to be found only in the
southeast, but they have been reported in growing
numbers in Rhode Island, Connecticut and Cape Cod in recent years.
Scientists, however, don't believe they are
established in Maine and New Hampshire yet; the
few that have been found are probably straying
travelers, and there's no clear evidence yet that
they are surviving the winter and living out
their entire life cycle in northern New England.
But as the climate grows warmer and the ticks
advance northward, that is likely to change, said
Eleanor Lacombe, a research associate at the
Vector-borne Disease Laboratory of the Maine
Medical Center Research Institute, in South
Portland. She said "it's only a matter of time."
Lone Star ticks are more aggressive than native
New England ticks, such as the dog tick and
blacklegged tick, and their bites are more painful and leave bigger welts.
Lone star ticks do not transmit Lyme disease, but
they can transmit Rocky Mountain spotted fever,
tularemia, ehrlichiosis and Southern
tick-associated rash illness, whose symptoms are
similar to those of Lyme disease. The ticks can also cause tick paralysis.
A dog from Somersworth apparently contracted
Rocky Mountain spotted fever in June 2006 and had
to be euthanized. The disease is extremely rare
in northern New England. Lacombe said that of
1000 to 1500 ticks collected in Maine each year, about 10 are Lone Star ticks.
New Hampshire state entomologist Tom Durkis said
the state examines about 200 ticks in its
laboratories each year, and only 2 Lone Star
ticks have been found in the past 2 years. But
there's a good chance they will become more
common, since they're already in southern New England, he said.
"New Hampshire is just as susceptible and likely
to see more activity and possible establishment
in the near future," Durkis said.
Alan Eaton, a professor of entomology with the
University of New Hampshire Cooperative
Extension, said he has only seen a handful of
specimens in the past few years, but that's enough to get his attention.
"[There are] still enough reports turning up that
we're beginning to wonder if it's surviving in
New Hampshire," he said. "It's a critter we're still learning about."
Eaton said people walking in wooded or grassy
areas can avoid most tick bites by wearing long
pants (trousers) tucked into their socks, wearing
light-colored clothing and using tick repellent.

[This is an interesting report and is another
instance of speculation that global warming may
be responsible for extending the range or
abundance of arthropod vectors. The lone star
tick is _Amblyomma americanum_ and is a notorious
pest species in the USA, being found on the
atlantic coast from New York southwards to
Florida and extending westwards into Texas and
Oklahoma. It is the primary vector of human
monocytic ehrlichiosis (_Ehrlichia chaffeensis_)
and was more recently discovered as a vector of
_E. ewingii_ to dogs and also possibly humans. As
stated in the report, _A. americanum_ can also be
_ a vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever
(_Rickettsia rickettsii_) and tularemia (_Francisella tularensis_).
Like many hard (ixodid) ticks, _A. americanum_
can also cause tick paralysis. This condition is
not caused by a pathogen but is the host's (human
or animal) reaction to having large amount of
tick saliva, containing toxins, injected during
the prolonged feeding time of female hard ticks.
It is characterized by ascending paralysis, but
symptoms usually disappear upon removal of the tick(s).
The American dog tick and blacklegged tick are
vernacular names for _Dermacentor variabilis_ and Ixodes scapularis_. - Mod.MS]
