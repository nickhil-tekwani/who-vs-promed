----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Cacao swollen shoot virus_ (CSSV) populations in West Africa are highly variable and genetically structured into several different groups. To unravel the extent of isolate diversity and address the problems of low titer and mixed viral sequences in samples, we used Next Generation Sequencing technology.

We were able to reconstruct de novo 20 new complete genomes from cacao samples in the Cocoa Research Institute of Ghana (CRIG) Museum and from field samples collected in Côte d'Ivoire or Ghana. Based on thresholds of nucleotide divergence denoting species demarcation, we conclude there exist 7 new species associated with the cacao swollen shoot disease [CSSD]. These new species along with the 3 already described [see also ProMED-mail post 20171025.5404488] leads to 10, the total number of the complex of viral species associated with the disease.

CSSD has always been described as a disease endemic to West Africa. An attenuated form of CSSD in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka has been mentioned [but] to date, beyond West Africa, swellings were only reported in Sri Lanka. A sample from Sri Lanka exhibiting similar leaf symptomology to West African CSSD-affected plants was also included in the study and the corresponding sequence represents the genome of a new virus named cacao bacilliform Sri Lanka virus (CBSLV).

[Swollen shoot disease of cocoa (CSSD) caused by species of genus _Badnavirus_ can lead to severe crop losses. The viruses are thought to have been transferred to cocoa from West African forest trees. Symptoms vary with different viral strains, from severe effects on shoots and roots resulting in serious dieback or even death of the tree, to no symptoms at all. The viruses are spread by several species of mealybugs (_Pseudococcidae_) and may also be transmitted by grafting and mechanical inoculation. Seed transmission is also suspected.

Disease management relies on phytosanitation and clean planting material. Most affected countries require the removal of all infected trees and their neighbours. Mealybugs are difficult to control, and native forests serve as pathogen reservoirs. Keeping replanted trees from becoming reinfected would be challenging under local conditions, thus ongoing breeding programmes for virus- or vector-resistant crop varieties are crucial. Cross protection against severe viral strains by mild strains is also being trialled (see link below).

A westward spread of CSSD in Ghana led to a serious outbreak with more severe symptoms in 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081030.3416) and the possibility of the involvement of a new viral strain was considered. Ghana, Togo, Nigeria, and Côte d'Ivoire have signed an agreement to tackle the disease and subsequently molecular work has increased. The 3 badnaviruses currently recognised as cause of the disease are _Cacao swollen shoot virus_, _Cacao swollen shoot CD virus_, and _Cacao swollen shoot Togo A virus_. An additional proposed species, Cacao red vein virus (CRVV) was isolated from field samples (ProMED-mail post 20171025.5404488 and link below) and is suspected to be the causal agent of the rapid decline phenotype of CSSD.

Whether the additional virus sequences constructed by _in silico_ analysis in the report above are associated with intact virus particles and thus represent actual infectious viruses involved in CSSD _in vivo_ will need to be verified by pathogenicity and epidemiology studies.
