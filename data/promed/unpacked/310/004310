Wheat farmers in the north Rift region risk incurring losses running into
millions of shillings due to attacks of the crop by ants and an outbreak of
bacterial disease. The farmers said several hectares of the crop under
cultivation are likely to go to waste due to attack by rust due to the
ongoing heavy rains pounding the area.

The downpour, they said, has made it impossible for machinery to move on
the farms and to spray the crop against attacks by diseases and pests. "We
are incurring extra costs in containing further destruction of wheat by
ants and rusts, and the situation might turn worse unless the rain
subsides," said David Busienei, a large scale wheat farmer in Uasin Gishu
district. The heavy rains may result in rotting of the crop on the farms.
The north Rift region is considered the country's granary basket.

The spate of farmers abandoning cash crops suffering from poor prices has
spread to the coconut sector at the Coast province where frustrations over
lack of markets has led growers to cut down the trees. Presently, they are
also grappling with diseases affecting the trees in Kwale and Kaloleni
districts.

In Uganda, residents of Karamoja [sub-region including 5 districts in the
Northern Region] in the north east are enduring the effects of a prolonged
dry spell and emerging crop disease.

[In item [1], both bacterial and rust diseases of wheat are mentioned, but
it is uncertain how reliable this distinction may be. Several bacterial
diseases as well as 3 different rusts are known for this crop. Leaf,
stripe, and stem rusts are caused by different fungi in the genus
_Puccinia_, and Ug99, a recently emerged, highly virulent strain of stem
rust, has caused epidemics in Kenya before (for more information on the
wheat rusts please refer to previous ProMED-mail posts via the archives).
One or several of these pathogens may be causing the problems reported in
item [1].

For the diseases of coconut palm and the unspecified crops in items [2] and
[3], respectively, it is not possible to guess from the reports which
pathogens may be involved.
