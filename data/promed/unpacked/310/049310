Bird flu discovered at Hamburg
------------------------------
On an organic farm in Tangstedt in Hamburg, a form of avian influenza which is harmless to humans has been detected.

As a precautionary measure, the authorities have destroyed 1500 animals. The affected animals are 1200 laying hens and 300 geese. The action was completed on Thursday [20 Dec 2012] evening. A restricted area around the farm had been established with a radius of 1 km [0.62 mi]. Within this area, adjacent to Hamburg, there are a few private poultry farms, said the spokesman for the Consumer Agency Hamburg, Rico Schmidt. These would have their animals now kept indoors. So far no further cases had been identified. For poultry farmers outside the restricted area there are no restrictions.

The type of virus H5N3 is harmless to humans, stressed SDP [Social Democratic Party] district administration Klaus Ploeger. "Everything you have in the freezers, you can safely eat," he said, addressing the citizens. Other animal species, including pets, are not at risk. The killing of the affected poultry flocks was applied due to legal regulations, to prevent a slight possibility of the virus becoming pathogenic in future. Such is not the case if the H5N1 bird flu virus is encountered.

According to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, this is the 1st time that low pathogenic avian influenza has been detected in a poultry farm in Schleswig-Holstein.

The virus has now been demonstrated in the course of regular surveillance, said the Ministry of Agriculture. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, the National Reference Laboratory on Riems Island, confirmed the findings on Thursday [20 Dec 2012]. The animals did not show any signs of disease, but were found infected by the low-pathogenic virus. The risk analysis of the institute indicated it was likely that the virus originated from wild geese, said district veterinarian Karlheinz Reisewitz. According to the Kiel Department of Agriculture, this virus type had already been detected in mallard ducks in the Czech Republic and in wild birds in Georgia. Schleswig-Holstein is also pursuing a so-called wild bird monitoring to uncover possible cases.

[According to the media report, the affected holding is an organic one. Have these birds been kept outside?

Confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the media-derived information on the identification of the current LPAI virus as H5N3, is anticipated. The LPAI strains detected in Germany during 2010/2011 were of serotypes H5N2 and H7N7. - Mod.AS
