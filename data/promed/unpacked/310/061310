After successive floods that destroyed Aus paddy, pest attack and diseases
are making Amon prospects bleak in greater Rangpur, frustrating farmers and
worrying agriculture officials. Agriculture Extension Department (AED)
officials in Rangpur, Kurigram, Lalmonirhat, Nilphamari, and Gaibandha have
detected diseases along with pest attack in Amon fields that may affect the
crop, now in the flowering stage in most areas, our correspondents reported.

Rangpur
-------
Some farmers claimed that the diseases and pest attack may reduce the yield
by 25-30 per cent. Agriculture officials, however, differ on the extent of
damage. AED deputy director in Lalmonirhat, Aftab Uddin, said,
"Transplanted Amon on 625 hectares (1544 acres) of land out of 100 000
hectares (247 105 acres) in the district is so far affected with 'sheet
blight' and 'rot blight' diseases. This may decrease the yield by 2 to 5
per cent." Only BR-11 and Shawrna varieties of Amon are attacked by the
diseases, he said. "BR-11 is an old variety and so its disease resistance
capacity has decreased. Shawrna is an Indian variety not suitable to the
climate of the region," he explained.

Farmer Abu Moktadir of Itapotha village in Mogholhat union in Lalmonirhat
said, he used pesticide but is worried that he would not get even 30 to 40
per cent yield.

Rangpur AED deputy director, Shariful Alam, admitted 'sheet blight' and
'rot blight' diseases in Amon fields in 'some areas' but said the
'situation is now under control.' He said all agriculture officials have
been deployed in fields to monitor the situation. "Deficiency of potash in
lands in some areas in the district may affect Amon yield. Farmers use only
urea but they need to use potash also," the AED official said.

Khondker Topakkharul Islam of Dahiganj in Rangpur Sadar upazila said
farmers like him cannot afford to buy potash at high price now. He said
most of the late-transplanted Amon plants are attacked by 'sheet blight'.
Chief scientific officer of Bangladesh Rice Research Institute in Rangpur,
Dr MA Mojid, identified 2 major causes for the diseases. Climate in the
region is dry after floods, which is suitable for the diseases to grow.
Late planting may be another reason.

Nilphamari
----------
Widespread attack by 'brown plant hopper' in Amon fields in the district
has caused serious concern among farmers. They said the BR-11 variety is
more susceptible to the pest attack. About one fourth of BR-11 paddy fields
have so far been attacked, they claimed. The worst affected unions are
Panchapukur and Kachukata in Nilphamari Sadar upazila. In Dimla upazila,
the affected unions are Balapara, Jhunagachh Chapani, Khalisha Chapani,
Nautara, Purba Chhatnai, Paschim Chhatnai, and adjoining villages.

Mannan Fakir, a big farmer in Singdoi village in Sadar upazila said 'brown
plant hopper', locally called 'current poka', suddenly attacks paddy fields
in swarms, sucks the plants' fluid within a short time and turns them into
yellowish straw. Ramzan Ali of Gayaban village in Dimla said paddy fields
turn yellow after the attack. No ears of paddy come out from the plants.
Even animals do not eat affected paddy plants. The farmers said cold nights
and heat during day time is favourable for breeding of these insects.
Usually, low-lying lands are more affected.

Member of Uttar Titpara Union Parishad in Dimla, Abul Hossen, said paddy on
7 bighas out of his 24 bighas have been damaged by pest attack. Fazlar
Rahman of Modhya Haroa village in Sadar upazila said he sold his cow and
bought Amon seedlings at a high price for his one bigha of land after the
earlier crop was completely damaged by floods twice. But 'current poka' has
damaged the field, now in the flowering stage. The farmers alleged that
insecticides used by them are not effective against 'brown plant hopper'.

Pesticide trader Pijush Sarkar in Nilphamari town said farmers come to him
in large numbers every day for pesticide to combat attacks by 'brown plant
hopper'. He said Tido-20 SL and Mephsin are effective against the insects
but should be used in appropriate doses.

Nilphamari AED deputy director, Eunus Ali, said, however, that farmers'
claims of a massive pest attack is not correct. "Amon on only 50-60
hectares (124-148 acres) have so far been attacked by brown plant hopper in
the district. The attack has been effectively controlled," he claimed. A
total of 115 135 hectares (284 505 acres) were brought under Amon
cultivation in Nilphamari this year [2007] with a production target of 264
444 tonnes of rice, officials said.

Gaibandha
---------
About 20 per cent of Amon fields has so far been attacked by pests and
diseases, according to a field survey by agriculture extension officials.
Normally, downpours after flood and disproportionate use of fertiliser are
the main reasons for pest attack and disease, which need instant care for
remedy, they said. Amon fields turned brown due to deficiency of potash,
they said.

Farmers usually apply high dose of urea and lesser quantities of triple
super phosphate (TSP), murate of potash (MP), and zinc sulphate. This
creates an ideal situation for attack by diseases and pests, said Shahidur
Rahman, sub-assistant agriculture officer in Gaibandha Sadar upazila.
According to AED, Amon was cultivated on 114 851 hectares (284 acres) in
the district against a target of 127 447 hectares (315 acres) because of 2
floods.

The officials said, Amon on 397 hectares (981 acres) has been attacked by
'stem rot' disease, 145 hectares (358 acres) by 'leaf rot', 54 hectares
(133 acres) by 'stem blight,' and 40 hectares (99 acres) by 'brown plant
hopper' insects in the district. "We have already controlled 90 per cent of
the pest attack and stopped further attacks," said AED deputy director,
Abdul Matin. Adequate measure have been taken to combat spread of diseases
and pest attacks and an awareness campaign is going on urging farmers to
contact local agriculture officials in case of any problem, he added.

[The diseases referred to are sheath blight (called 'sheet blight' in this
report) caused by the fungus _Thanatephorus cucumeris_ (previously
_Rhizoctonia solani_; for further disease information see ProMED-mail post
20070718.2300), and stem rot caused by the fungus _Sclerotium oryzae_
(further information in ProMED-mail post 20070424.1340). The names 'rot
blight', 'leaf rot,' and 'stem blight' are not commonly used for any rice
diseases and it is not clear which problems are referred to here.

The Asian brown planthopper (_Nilaparvata lugens_) is one of the worst
pests of rice in the Australasian and Pacific Island region. It is also the
vector of _Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) and _Rice
ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_). These viruses can cause
serious yield losses and are spreading in large parts of the rice-growing
areas of Asia. In tropical regions levels of infection and vector density
are often very high. For more information see ProMED-mail post no.

Aman or amon rice is a term used in Bangladesh and east India for lowland
rice grown in the wet season during June to November. BR-11 and Shawrna (or
Sharna) are varieties of Aman. Aus rice is a photoperiod-insensitive,
rainfed, drought-prone, lowland or upland rice, broadcast and transplanted
during the early part of the wet season from March to September in
Bangladesh and from April to August in east India. A 3rd type used in the
region is boro rice, an irrigated, high-yielding, cold-tolerant, relatively
pest-free, and photoperiod-insensitive rice cultivated during the winter
months in India and Bangladesh.

The bigha is a unit of measurement of area of land, commonly used in Nepal,
Bangladesh, and in a few states of India. The size of a bigha may vary
considerably depending on the region. In Bangladesh the bigha is equivalent
to 0.1338 hectares (0.33 acres).

This report is an example of the different perceptions of the seriousness
of agricultural problems by politicians and farmers. Without doubt, the
farmers in the area are facing serious hardship.
