Given the floods throughout the Island caused by the passage of Hurricane Fiona [that made landfall in southwestern Puerto Rico on 18 Sep 2022], the Department of Health issued a health alert on Monday [26 Sep 2022] about leptospirosis, a disease that can affect anyone who comes into contact with water contaminated with the urine of infected animals and have identified 7 suspected cases that are under investigation.

"Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can cause serious health conditions in the kidneys, liver, meningitis, difficulty breathing, and bleeding. It is a disease that could be fatal. Since last week [week of 19 Sep 2022] we have issued a notice and we are calling on the public to know how to prevent it, specifically to stay away from contaminated water," said the Secretary of Health, Dr Carlos Mellado, in written statements.

A sample was taken from all patients and the result is awaited; however, since it was a lethal disease, all patients began antibiotic treatment. The cases [include] 4 men and 3 women between the ages of 10 to 69 years. The suspected cases are found in the Bayamón, Metro, Ponce, Caguas, and Mayagüez regions.

Last Monday, 19 Sep 2022, a Health Notice about the disease was shared with health facilities, all hospitals, CDTs [diagnosis and treatment centers], 330 Centers [primary health centers], and dialysis clinics, and the guide for managing patient cases related to this disease. The guide is available at https://www.salud.gov.pr/leptospirosis [in Spanish/English].

The incubation period for leptospirosis is 2 to 30 days; most cases of illness occur 5 to 14 days after exposure. The 1st symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, muscle aches, red eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellow skin and eyes), rash, and cough.

Some recommendations to avoid getting infected with leptospirosis:
- Do not walk, swim, bathe, submerge your head, or swallow flood water or any body of water that may be contaminated with animal urine or flood water.
- Cover skin cuts with waterproof bandages, Band-Aids, or other material that does not allow water to enter.
- If you are going to drive with debris, wear long-sleeved clothing, cover most of the skin, and wear gloves, safety glasses, and closed shoes.
- Don't walk outside barefoot. Wear waterproof protective clothing, gloves, closed shoes, or boots near water or wet ground that may be contaminated.
- Do not use flood water or water bodies to clean the house or wash clothes.
- Keep food and garbage in closed containers and, if you can, set out rat traps.
- If you feel ill and have the following symptoms you should seek medical evaluation immediately. Early detection saves lives.

Finally, a call is made for anyone who has symptoms of leptospirosis to immediately contact their health professional or visit an emergency room. "Treatment against the disease is more effective when it is started as soon as possible," concluded the Secretary.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall and flooding with fresh water. Parts of Puerto Rico saw more than 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain and subsequent flooding with Hurricane Maria in 2017, which was followed by outbreaks of leptospirosis.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - New Zealand: rural, occupational, animal, waterways exposures 20220706.8704256.

Puerto Rico has 6 regions: Metro Region includes Bayamon and San Juan; the East Region includes Caguas; the South Region includes Ponce; and the West Region includes Mayaguez. A map showing the location of these regions can be found at https://welcome.topuertorico.org/city/region.shtml. - Mod.ML
