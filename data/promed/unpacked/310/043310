[1] Cholera, post-cyclone - Myanmar (Irrawaddy): WHO confirmation

An international aid agency has confirmed some cases of cholera in
Myanmar's cyclone-hit Irrawaddy delta but the number was in line with
normal levels in previous years, an aid official said on Friday [16 May
2008]. "We do have some confirmed cholera," WHO representative Maureen
Birmingham told a news conference in Bangkok. She was speaking on behalf of
around 30 health groups trying to get medical aid into the delta, where
cholera is endemic.

"We don't have an explosion of cholera. Thus far the rate of cholera is no
greater than the background rate that we would be seeing in Myanmar during
this season," she said. A network was still being set up to monitor for
diseases among 2.5 million people severely affected by the cyclone that
tore through the delta 2 weeks ago, she said.

Diarrhea, dysentery, and skin infections have afflicted some cyclone
refugees crammed into monasteries, schools, and other temporary shelters
after the devastating 2 May 2008 storm. Corpses are still rotting along the
banks of the Irrawaddy river 2 weeks after the disaster which killed up to
128 000, but WHO said they pose no risk to public health. "There has never
been a documented case of a post-natural disaster epidemic that could be
traced to dead bodies," WHO said in a statement.

[At this point, WHO has confirmed the cholera outbreak. Although the number
of cases is small, it would not be at all surprising if many more cases
will occur or are occurring in areas not reached yet. A map of Myanmar can

Diarrhea has taken a serious toll in Sapata VDC in Bajura district
following its outbreak 2 weeks ago. So far, 3 people have died and more
than a dozen villagers are in a critical state due to the deadly outbreak
even as locals fear that it may spread to adjoining villages if nothing is
done about it.

[The degree of severity in this report suggests that the etiology may well
be cholera. Bajura district is in the Far Western region of Nepal and can

indeed, reported in bordering districts in 2007. - Mod.LL]

Nyanza Province has had cholera outbreaks since late 2007, where the 1st
case was confirmed in Suba District on 2 Dec 2007. The outbreaks have so
far been reported in 10 districts: Suba, Migori, Rongo, Bondo, Kisumu East
and West, South Kisii, Homa Bay, Nyando, and Siaya. According to the
statistics from the provincial medical officer of Nyanza Province, 708
cases of cholera have been recorded in the health facilities in the region
and 42 deaths from the disease have been registered.

In some districts like Rongo, Migori, Suba, and Kisumu West the outbreaks
are sporadic. The common features about these outbreaks are that they are
occurring in households whose main water sources are rivers and lakes. In
addition, the sanitation component (latrine coverage) in the affected
divisions of the above-mentioned districts is as low as one per cent.

[4] Cholera - Namibia (Ohangwena)

Lack of pit latrines and general toilet facilities in the northern regions
of the country is likely to compromise health officials' efforts in curbing
cholera, a disease that has since early in 2008 claimed more than 37 lives.
Regional health director for the Ohangwena Region, Dr Naftali Hamata, has
said if no drastic measures are taken to address the situation, the
affected areas should be prepared to have cholera cases every rainy season.

Since Friday [9 May 2008], 1406 suspected cholera cases were recorded in
the Ohangwena Region with 17 confirmed laboratory cases and 19 deaths, Dr
Hamata said. "Sanitation and clean water remain some of the challenges in
the regions. The majority of people do not have access to latrines, a good
place for cholera to spread," the doctor said.

A total of 9 cases of cholera have been reported in Mansa, Luapula
Province. A woman from Nchelenge was also admitted to Butungwa clinic in
Mansa with suspected cholera. The 9 cholera patients are all from Sebe
Village, but are admitted to a cholera center in Samfya as it is nearest to
the village.

Mansa district commissioner, Moddy Chola, said no deaths have been recorded
so far. Ms Chola is appealing to the Ministry of Health to urgently send
medicine and other requirements to help curb the spread of the disease.

Angop (Angola Press Agency) learnt on Monday [12 May 2008] from the
provincial health director, Quiala Godi, that 29 cases of cholera, from
which 2 resulted in deaths, were registered last week [5-11 May 2008] in
the northern Uige province by the local health authorities.

According to the official, one of the deaths was registered at the Negage
Municipal Hospital coming from Dambi village, due to the late arrival at
the hospital, while the other was not registered at a hospital in Caquiuia
ward, next to Uige city. He revealed that the 1st case of the
epidemiological outbreak was detected on the 2nd part of April 2008 and
samples were sent to the country's capital, Luanda, registering negative
results, but the cases of diarrhea continue emerging, a situation that
intensified in the beginning of May 2008.
