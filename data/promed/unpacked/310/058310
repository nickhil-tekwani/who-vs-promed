So far in 2018, there have been a total of 7 outbreaks of scabies, with 59 affected in the region, most cases health care workers.

The Public Health Agency of Catalonia has declared a new outbreak of scabies at the Moisès Broggi Hospital in Sant Joan Despí (Barcelona), with 4 affected workers, in addition to 35 at Sant Joan Hospital in Reus (Tarragona).

The secretary of the Public Health Agency of Catalonia, Joan Guix, released this data on Thursday [25 Jan 2018] at a press conference in Barcelona, during which it was reported that in 2018, there have been a total of 7 scabies outbreaks with 59 affected in Catalonia.

In addition to the 2 outbreaks in the hospitals of Reus and Sant Joan Despí, there have been another 5 outbreaks in 3 nursing homes, with 3, 4 and 5 cases, respectively in a family (4 members) and in the Montoliu school, La Riera de Gaià (Tarragona), with 4 affected children. The outbreak of the hospital Sant Joan, of Reus, is the most important detected and declared in Catalonia until now, although in 2012, there was another, with 26 affected professionals in another health center.

The Health Federation of CCOO of Catalonia dates the outbreak on 11 Jan 2018, when several workers of the emergency service attended the Occupational Health Committee with the suspicion that they had scabies and asked that appropriate measures be taken in view of the ease of transmission of this disease.

The definitive diagnosis as an outbreak of scabies was made on 17 Jan 2018, when the relevant treatments began, and, according to the union, the company then informed the Department of Health of the Generalitat.

The deputy general director of Surveillance and Emergency Response of Public Health, Mireia Jané, has specified in the same press conference that, between 2010 and 2017, 115 outbreaks of scabies have been detected in Catalonia, with 947 people affected, mostly in geriatric residences. Thus, 41% of the outbreaks occur in residences of the elderly, many of whom do not realize that the mite is affecting them due to neurological or disease problems, so it is easily transmitted.

The head of the Dermatology Department of the Hospital Dos de Maig, Joan Antoni Smandia, said that the infection among the emergency staff of the Reus Hospital has been extensive, since it is within a small area with easy to share sofas, beds, robes and lockers. Smandia noted that scabies has always been around and that he sees cases every year and that if it is treated with permethrin once and repeated after a week, the treatment is effective at eliminating this annoying mite.

[Scabies is highly contagious and will spread before it is recognized that there is an outbreak. In addition to using permethrin, treatment with ivermectin (tablets) is highly effective in killing the mites in the skin. - Mod.EP
