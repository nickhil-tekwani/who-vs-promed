[The follow-up report above, submitted 29 Dec 2012, does not add new outbreaks or new epidemiological comments to those included in follow-up report no 7, submitted 26 Dec 2012. However it conveniently provides a summing-up of all lumpy skin disease (LSD) outbreaks recorded in Israel during 2012, and updated information on the number of vaccinated cattle (107 094 vaccinated animals, compared to the earlier figure of 44 136).

In a separate, locally distributed circular (in Hebrew), dated 27 Dec 2012, VSAH added that the morbidity rate recorded within infected cattle herds varied between 0.1 and 95 percent, while mortality varied between 0 and 25 percent. So far, 114 herds have been found infected, of which 14 dairy cattle herds (number of herds is not identical to the number of outbreaks; in some cases, several herds belonged to the same outbreak/locality).

Regarding R&D, the circular further stated that an additional vaccine is under investigation, while a revised protocol for the application of the current vaccine in use [sheep pox vaccine JOVAC] is being contemplated to improve vaccination efficacy. Additional LSD research and knowledge gathering are being initiated, in collaboration with the agricultural scientific community and with international bodies, to improve abilities to deal with LSD spreading factors and to enhance its control.

The follow-up report above (source URL) includes a map showing all 55 outbreaks since the start of the epizootic in July 2012. The epizootic started in July in the Golan sub-district, bordering Syria and Lebanon, from where it spread in a south-westerly direction, now circulating also in the adjacent sub-districts of Zefat and Kinneret. All 3 infected sub-districts are located within Hazafon District.

The LSD situation in Syria and/or Lebanon remains to be illuminated. - Mod.AS]
