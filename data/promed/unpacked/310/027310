Bird flu prevention authorities in the central Ninh Thuan Province have raised an alarm about the possible return of a new epidemic after an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu was discovered last week among a flock of poultry in the province's Ninh Son District.

About 1000 ducks owned by Dang Hung Kien, a farmer in the Ninh Son District, were immediately culled after a variety of samples were confirmed to have been infected with H5N1 bird flu.

The farmer had earlier reported to the local health preventive authority that a large number of birds in his flock had died of symptoms of H5N1, such as blindness and paralysed legs.

A series of preventive measures were undertaken to quarantine the infected areas.

In May 2015, an outbreak of H5N1 was discovered in the same district and a total of 2500 ducks were culled.

The Ministry of Health's Preventive Medicine Department has asked the health sector in Ninh Thuan to roll out precautionary measures to prevent any possible transmission of A/H5N1 bird flu strain to humans.

The provincial Health Department was tasked with intensifying communication campaigns regarding protection measures for those living in high-risk areas. It will also focus on management and supervision while keeping a close watch over vulnerable residents to detect infected cases immediately.

Local hospitals were requested to prepare necessary facilities, equipment and medicine stocks for supervising and treating suspected cases. The Preventive Medicine Department also recommended regular washing of hands with soap, practicing personal hygiene and avoiding direct contact with A/H5N1 patients or sick poultry to effectively prevent the disease.

Vietnam recorded its initial A/H5N1 cases in fowl and humans in December 2003. The virus has since spread and triggered a number of outbreaks, causing severe health and economic damage.
