More Norwegian pig herds infected with swine flu
------------------------------------------------
Another 8 pig herds in Nord-Trondelag in Norway have been diagnosed
with the swine flu, and Minister of Agriculture Lars Peder Brekk has
asked that pig farmers be given priority when the mass vaccination
program against the flu begins.

Experts said the flu spreads from humans to pigs more easily than
earlier believed. The Minister is therefore concerned about the
possibility that farmers will infect their own animals, and that the
disease will gain a foothold in Norway, which has up to now been free
of the disease among animals.

A pig herd of 500 animals were mass slaughtered on Tuesday [13 Oct
2009], after swine flu was confirmed on a farm in the county of
Nord-Trondelag last week. Another 900 pigs from a 2nd farm will also
be slaughtered. This is the 1st time that swine flu has been
diagnosed on pigs in Norway, and the mass slaughtering is a measure
to prevent the disease from spreading. The slaughtered animals will
be incinerated.

[Norway reported to the OIE, so far, 3 H1N1 outbreaks on pig farms.
The initial, immediate notification was submitted on 12 Oct 2009;
follow-up reports were submitted on 13 and 16 Oct 2009; all 3,
including a map, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8515>.

The most recent follow-up report, number 2, submitted on 16 Oct 2009,
included the following epidemiological comments: "More herds in the
district are infected though not all of them have been tested and
confirmed as having the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 variant. No
animal contact between this herd and the 2 first confirmed cases. The
virus seems to be extremely contagious between humans and pigs. On 15
October, we decided to abandon our attempt at culling infected herds."

The international public and animal health agencies FAO, OIE, and the
WHO published in May 2009 a common statement pertaining to pork
safety, which included the following (see ProMED-mail archive number
20090507.1710):

"Influenza viruses are not known to be transmissible to people
through eating processed pork or other food products derived from pigs.

Heat treatments commonly used in cooking meat (such as 70 deg C/160
deg F core temperature) will readily inactivate any viruses
potentially present in raw meat products.

Pork and pork products, handled in accordance with good hygienic
practices recommended by the WHO, Codex Alimentarius Commission, and
the OIE, will not be a source of infection.

Authorities and consumers should ensure that meat from sick pigs or
pigs found dead are not processed or used for human consumption under
any circumstances." - Mod.AS]
