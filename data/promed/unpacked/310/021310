The Healdsburg Pickling Company is voluntarily recalling 3 of its pickled food products after the California Department of Public Health warned consumers that they may have been improperly produced. The products affected by the recall are green beans, carrots and pickles, which are packaged in quart and pint jars with screw-on metal lids. They have the label "Healdsburg Pickling Company" but do not have any coding or "use by" dates on the labels, officials said. The products were sold at The Cheese Shop in Healdsburg and Perry's Deli in Inverness.

While no illnesses have been linked to any of the products, state health officials are asking consumers who have purchased the products to discard them. Possible improper packaging could make the products susceptible to contamination, causing botulism, a rare but sometimes fatal illness.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Pickling food in an acidic medium such as vinegar is one way of preserving the food and minimizing the risk of botulism, since the spores do not germinate below pH 4.6. Inadequate acidification, therefore, may be the issue here, and this has occurred before related to human botulism, as an example, from home-made pickled eggs (CDC: Foodborne botulism from eating home-pickled eggs --- Illinois, 1997. MMWR 2000;49:778-780). - Mod.LL
