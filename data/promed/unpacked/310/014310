California: West Nile virus positive crow found in south of state
-----------------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has been detected in 3 dead birds in Southern California,
the state Department of Health Services has announced. The virus was found
in a dead crow in the San Gabriel Valley on Thu 1 Apr 2004 and in 2 local
house finches in Orange County on Wed 31 Apr 2004 [already reported in
previous ProMED-mail posts].
"West Nile virus has been detected earlier than expected in 2004, probably
due to unseasonably warm weather," state health director Sandra Shewry said
in a prepared statement. "The state's surveillance system is closely
monitoring for any evidence of the virus across the state."
The virus has not yet been detected in humans in 2004. During 2003, 3
people, all from Southern California, tested positive for the virus.
California is one of the last states to be affected; in 2003 the virus was
linked to 9389 illnesses and 246 deaths in 46 states.

[2] Surveillance data - (Florida)

Situation in Florida and a comment on data interpretation
---------------------------------------------------------
"In a preceding update [see: West Nile virus update 2004 - USA (01)
20040401.0885] the moderator commented that: "It may be indicative of the
characteristics of the impending outbreak in 2004 that the first reports
have originated from the south (Texas) and the west coast (California)".
These may indeed be the 1st reports sent to ProMED-mail. However, clearly
ProMED-mail reports should be used to interpreting (sic) epidemiology with
great caution. Like any passive data collecting system, the information
sent voluntarily to ProMED-mail is likely incomplete. West Nile
virus-positive wild birds and sentinel chickens have continually been
detected in Florida every month since the 1st West Nile virus-infected bird
was detected in Florida on 3 Jul 2001. Florida surveillance information
collected by the Florida Department of Health from throughout the state can
be viewed at <http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Environment/hsee/arbo/surv_info.htm>.
The "1st" reports of positive birds may not provide any useful information
about the characteristics of a presumed 2004 impending outbreak in humans,
if indeed such an outbreak does occur. Florida has continuing evidence of
year-long West Nile virus transmission with relatively few human cases to
date. Of course this could change and is of great concern. Florida
continues to monitor West Nile virus transmission using a sentinel
surveillance system."

[We are very aware of the dangers of over-interpreting reports received by
ProMED-mail -- hence my comment was prefaced by the phrase ".....may be
indicative......". It is only recently, however, that ArboNET and Health
Canada have compiled and released comprehensive surveillance data for North
America. Even so, trends are difficult to analyse with certainty, because
surveillance data are recorded at state or provincial level, and practice
and commitment are variable. For example some states/provinces ceased to
report data after the first appearance of West Nile virus at county level
(whereas others did not), which makes direct comparison of numerical data
problematic. During 2003, West Nile virus infection appeared to spread
westwards, leaving a much diminished epidemic toward the east. (To what
extent reporting fatigue in the east and the novelty of the situation in
the west contributed to this situation is difficult to access.) - Mod.CP]

[3] Blood donation and transfusion screening 2003 - USA : MMWR update

Update: West Nile virus screening of blood donations and
transfusion-associated transmission -- United States, 2003
----------------------------------------------------
In 2002, transfusion-associated transmission (TAT) of West Nile virus (WNV)
infection acquired through blood transfusion marked the emergence of a new
threat to the US blood supply (1). Although mosquitoborne transmission
remains the predominant mode of WNV transmission (2), identification of TAT
underscored the need for WNV screening of donated blood. In June 2003,
blood-collection agencies (BCAs) implemented investigational WNV nucleic
acid-amplification tests (NATs) to screen all blood donations and identify
potentially infectious donations for quarantine and retrieval. This
screening was performed on about 6 million units during June to December
2003, resulting in the removal of at least 818 viremic blood donations from
the blood supply. This report summarizes the results of blood-donation
screening tests conducted during 2003 and describes 6 cases of WNV TAT that
occurred because of transfusion of components containing low levels of
virus not detected by the testing algorithm. These data indicate that blood
screening for WNV has improved blood safety. However, a small risk of WNV
transfusion-associated transmission remains. To address this risk, changes
to screening strategies are planned for 2004.
BCA testing activities
----------------------
In June 2003, under the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA)
investigational new drug (IND) mechanism, BCAs began screening donations by
using NATs from 2 test-kit manufacturers. Initial screening protocols
included NAT performed on mini-pools (MP NAT) of samples from 6 or 16
donations, depending on the test-kit manufacturer. Donation samples that
were part of reactive mini-pools were tested individually. Any reactive
samples were re-tested by individual donation testing (IDT NAT). In certain
cases, an alternate sample from the same donation or an alternate NAT might
have been used for re-testing. In addition, selected blood banks serving
areas with epidemic activity stopped using this MP NAT screening algorithm
and implemented IDT NAT screening during limited periods of the epidemic
season. Donors of IDT NAT-reactive samples identified by either screening
method were asked to participate in a BCA-directed follow-up study to
confirm WNV infection and evaluate for the persistence of WNV RNA in blood
samples collected subsequently. Both follow-up samples and the
index-donation samples were tested for WNV-specific IgM antibody. Donations
that were IDT NAT-reactive were not released for transfusion; these donors
were deferred from donating blood again until >28 days after the date of
collection for the last NAT-reactive sample and the documented development
of WNV-specific antibody.
To determine the sensitivity of the MP NAT-screening algorithm, certain
BCAs performed retrospective testing studies in selected areas that
experienced high rates of viremic donations. In these studies, individual
components of archived MP NAT-negative donation samples were re-tested by
IDT NAT.
Surveillance activities
-----------------------
For surveillance purposes, a donation that was repeatedly reactive on IDT
NAT was considered to be from a presumptive viremic donor (PVD).
Cooperating local blood centers provided reports of PVDs (including donor
age, sex, postal code, and date of donation) to state health departments,
which provided reports to ArboNET, the national arbovirus surveillance system.
As of 31 Mar 2004, state and local health departments had reported 818 PVDs
to ArboNET; dates of collection ranged from 25 Jun to 2 Dec 2003 [data
presented as a figure in the original text]. Complete information was
available for 811 (99 per cent) of these PVDs; 6 (1 per cent) had West Nile
viral encephalitis or meningitis subsequent to donation (median age: 45
years, range: 28 to 76), 137 (17 per cent) had West Nile fever (median age:
46 years, range: 17 to 76), and 654 (81 per cent) remained asymptomatic. Of
the PVDs reported to ArboNET, 691 (85 per cent) were residents of 9 states
(Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South
Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming). These states experienced WNV epidemics in 2003
and accounted for 60 per cent of reported cases of West Nile viral
encephalitis or meningitis.
WNV transfusion-associated transmission investigations
------------------------------------------------------
Since 2002, public health authorities have been encouraged to investigate
reports of WNV illness among patients who had received blood transfusions
<4 weeks before illness onset and to report these suspected TAT cases to
CDC. A probable TAT was defined as transfusion to a recipient who 1) had a
confirmed WNV infection (3) and 2) had received a blood product from a
NAT-reactive index donation associated with a donor with WNV-specific IgM
antibody in the index donation or a follow-up collection. A confirmed TAT
case was defined as meeting the criteria for a probable case and having any
one of the following criteria: 1) Unlikely mosquito exposure during the 14
days before recipient illness onset; 2) testing of remaining diagnostic
samples from the hospitalized transfusion recipient indicating that WNV
infection occurred at the time of transfusion; or 3) transfusion of a
co-component of the infectious donation into another recipient who then had
a confirmed WNV infection. A case was classified as a non-case if WNV
infection could not be confirmed in the recipient <4 weeks after the
implicated transfusions, if WNV RNA was not identified in any implicated
donation, or if all implicated donors were seronegative for WNV. If samples
were not available to satisfy the criteria for probable, confirmed, or
non-case classification, the case was considered inconclusive.
During 2003, a total of 23 suspected cases of WNV TAT were reported to CDC.
Public health authorities reported 15 suspected cases of WNV TAT among
patients who had WNV illness after receiving transfusions. Another 8
suspected cases were in recipients of components derived from low-level
viremic donations that were identified during special retrospective studies
of MP-negative blood retested with IDT NAT by 2 BCAs. Follow-up of these 8
cases was performed to determine whether WNV infection had resulted from
the implicated transfusions. As a result of these 23 investigations, 6
cases were classified as confirmed or probable WNV TAT, 11 as non-cases,
and 3 as inconclusive. As of 27 Mar 2004, 3 cases remained under investigation.
In each of these 6 confirmed or probable cases, the recipient received
components from multiple donations; however, only one infectious blood
component was found in each case. All 6 of these infectious donations had
been collected during the period 29 Jul to 18 Sep 2003, and were not
identified in MP screening. The median age of the 6 recipients was 63 years
(range: 13 to 82); 4 had WNV encephalitis, one had West Nile fever, and one
critically ill patient did not have discernible WNV-compatible illness
despite confirmed WNV infection. A sufficient index-donation sample was
available to estimate the titer of the implicated donor's viremia in 4 of 6
cases: the median estimated viremia was 0.11 plaque-forming units per
milliliter (pfu/mL) (range: 0.06 to 0.5 pfu/mL). 2 of these 6 cases were
reported previously (4); a description of a 3rd case follows.
On 31 Aug 2003, a boy aged 13 years was admitted to a hospital with
multiple injuries. On 1 Sep 2003, he received 3 units of packed red blood
cells. On 9 Sep 2003, after hospital discharge, he had a maculopapular
rash. On 12 Sep 2003, he was readmitted to the hospital with fever,
headache, vomiting, and diarrhea, consistent with West Nile fever; blood
drawn on that day was positive for WNV-specific IgM antibody.
The 3 transfused blood units had been collected during the 2nd week of
August 2003. No donors of this blood reported symptoms of WNV illness
before or after donation. Samples from these donations were non-reactive
for WNV RNA by MP NAT performed on 6-specimen mini-pools. All other
components derived from these 3 donations were quarantined immediately;
there were no co-component recipients. Recalled plasma samples from the 3
index donations were WNV IgM-negative. One donor seroconverted evidenced by
development of WNV-specific IgM antibody in serum collected 50 days after
donation. Recalled plasma from this donor was reactive when tested by IDT
NAT. CDC confirmed results by using polymerase chain reaction; the
estimated viral load was 0.09 pfu/mL. The recipient recovered without sequelae.

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
Previous studies have documented that an estimated 80 per cent of
WNV-infected people remain asymptomatic but are believed to have viremia
lasting a median of 6.5 days (5,6). Asymptomatic WNV-infected people with
viremia probably represent the largest risk group of blood donors. Because
symptom screening at the time of blood donation will not identify most
viremic donors, screening by NAT was implemented rapidly to identify
potentially infectious blood donations by detecting WNV RNA. Use of
blood-donor screening for WNV by NAT under the IND mechanism has enhanced
the safety of the blood supply. Despite this enhanced safety, documentation
of the 6 WNV TAT cases in 2003 indicates that blood components containing
low levels of virus might escape detection and that at least some of these
might be infectious. Virus loads in infectious donations were considerably
lower in 2003 than in 2002 (1). In 2002, the estimated viremia levels in
implicated donations were 0.8 to 75 pfu/mL, compared with 0.06 to 0.5
pfu/mL for TAT cases during 2003. The reasons for this lower range are
unclear, and the lower limit of donor viremia that can lead to
transfusion-associated infection is unknown.
Data collected during 2003 will be considered by the blood supply community
in collaboration with public health authorities when developing screening
strategies for 2004, when widespread seasonal transmission of WNV is
expected to continue. MP screening will continue to identify most persons
who donate during the short viremic period, but prospective IDT might be
implemented in regions with high WNV-infection rates (that is, high
MP-screening--test yields). However, the capacity of laboratory equipment
and personnel for performing IDT and the availability of reagents are
limited, and the higher false-positive rate of IDT (compared with MP
screening) could have a negative short-term impact on the availability of
blood in these regions.
About 4.5 million people receive blood or blood products annually. Although
people who need blood transfusions should be aware of the limited risk for
WNV infection, the benefits of receiving needed transfusions outweigh the
potential risk for WNV infection. In addition, blood donation poses no risk
to the donor for acquiring WNV, and the US Public Health Service encourages
blood donation. FDA, CDC, and the blood-collection community will continue
to evaluate WNV-screening strategies to ensure blood safety.
