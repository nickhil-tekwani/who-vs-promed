The Ministry of Health informs the general public that a hemorrhagic fever outbreak has been confirmed in Omot sub-county, Agago district. Following tests done by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Entebbe, the samples obtained from one person have tested positive for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) [virus infection].

CCHF is a zoonotic disease that is caused by a tick-borne virus (genus _Nairo-Virus_) of the family _Bunyaviridae_. This virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks; it is highly infectious and kills about 40 percent of people infected. It is endemic in livestock in Africa, e.g. cattle, goats and sheep. This virus is transmitted to human beings through bites of infected ticks. The ticks pick up their infection from wild or domestic animals like sheep, cattle and goats, among others. The signs and symptoms of the disease range from sudden headache, high fever, back pain, joint muscle pain, stomach pain, vomiting, red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and bleeding from some body parts. The infection has a short incubation period of 3-5 days.

The confirmed case of CCHF is a male adult farmer from Baroma village, Atece Parish in Omot Sub-county in Agago District. His illness started on 8 Aug 2013 presenting with a high fever, general body weakness, muscle pains, and bleeding from some body parts. He was admitted at Kalongo Hospital on 10 Aug 2013 and is still undergoing supportive treatment. We are also investigating 3 other deaths in Omot sub-county in relation to the outbreak [i.e. this case].

In response to the outbreak, the Ministry of Health has reactivated the task force to coordinate all responses. A district task force has, in addition, been organised to coordinate the local responses.

[The following addendum is from Dr. Elioda Tumwesigye, Minister of State for Health (General Duties); Vishnu-Priya Snellers, CDC-Uganda:

"A technical team from the Ministry of Health and other partners will today [16 Aug 2013] be dispatched to the district to conduct further investigations and support the response on ground. Surveillance teams in the district have intensified their activities to trace and identify contacts. So far, 6 contacts from Omot sub-county have been identified and are all under strict surveillance.

A temporary isolation section has been identified at Kalongo Hospital to accommodate any suspected cases. Health workers at Kalongo Hospital have been briefed to enhance their infection and prevention control. The public in the affected areas is, therefore, advised to observe the following:
1. Avoid close physical contact with suspected/infected people or their body fluids.
2. Report to a nearby health facility in case of showing the above symptoms and signs.
3. Wear long sleeved, light coloured clothing when dealing with livestock so as to identify ticks quickly and avoid tick bites.
4. Avoid direct contact with animals (e.g. slaughtering) without protective wear.
5. Report to the Ministry of Health Hotline at 0750996034."

In a Reuters report previously posted in ProMED-mail (Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Uganda: (AG) fatal 20130816.1885056), it was stated that 3 patients had died as a result of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. The official ministry statement posted above indicates that only the currently surviving farmer is a confirmed case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever. The 3 deceased patients are suspected to have died as a result of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, but this has not yet been confirmed.
