The Stanislaus County Health Services Agency has confirmed that the county has seen its 1st case of the St. Louis encephalitis virus [infection] with the diagnosis of a male county resident in his 70s.

"He had symptoms and was tested in September [2017]," said Stanislaus County Public Health Officer Dr. Julie Vaishampayan. "Confirmatory testing was performed 1st by the California Department of Public Health, followed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

The diagnosis marks the 2nd confirmed case of the virus in a person in California for the year [2017].

The East Side and Turlock Mosquito Abatement Districts received confirmation in August [2017] that a mosquito sample from Stanislaus County has tested positive for St. Louis encephalitis virus, which is similar to West Nile virus and carried by the same type of mosquitoes. This was the 1st time the virus had been detected in the area for more than 40 years. As of now, the virus has been found in mosquitoes in 14 California counties.

St. Louis encephalitis virus was recognized in California in 1937 and caused periodic epidemics in humans and horses until 1989, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Like West Nile virus, most people who become infected with SLEV will never feel sick. Most people who do feel sick will have mild flu-like symptoms. A small number of people will have severe disease with headache, confusion, disorientation, and dizziness. Seizures, paralysis, coma, and sometimes death may occur. Severe disease is more likely in people who are older and those with weakened immune systems. Also, like West Nile virus, there is no vaccine for SLEV or a specific course of treatment.

The colder temperatures have dramatically decreased mosquito activity in the region, but health officials are urging county residents to take precautions to avoid being bitten.
- Dump or drain standing water. These are places mosquitoes like to lay their eggs.
- Defend yourself against mosquitoes by using repellants containing DEET, Picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus.
- Avoid being outdoors at dusk and dawn. These are the times when WNV carrying mosquitoes are generally most active.
- Report neglected swimming pools to your local MAD. [There has been a problem in the past in California with abandoned swimming pools becoming major vector mosquito breeding sites. - Mod.TY]
- Use tight fitting door and window screens to keep mosquitoes from entering your home.

[Active St. Louis encephalitis [SLE] virus transmission has been occurring in several locations in California this year (2017) in localities where it has been absent for many years. It has recently been detected in mosquitoes in Butte County after an absence of 48 years. A sentinel chicken in Merced County tested positive for St Louis encephalitis virus for the 1st time in decades. In August 2017, the virus was found in mosquitoes in 2 other counties in California: Yuba and Stanislaus counties. Now, a human case has been reported above in Stanislaus county. SLE virus is endemic in the southwestern USA, and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. In 2015, human cases occurred in the adjoining states of Nevada and Arizona, and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005.

Wild birds are the reservoir hosts, and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are the vectors that transmit SLE virus. The mosquito species in which SLEV was detected are not mentioned in the above report. Avoidance of mosquito bites is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents.
