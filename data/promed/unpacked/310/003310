Virus threatens farms
----------------------
Dairy and beef farmers on the South Coast are gearing up for a virus which
has already claimed at least half a dozen calves in the Jamberoo area. The
full impact will be known in late winter and early spring during calving,
but indications suggest it could be one of the worst Akabane outbreaks for
a few years.
Tests on a sentinel cattle herd in Nowra have shown that 10 out of 10
heifers have been infected with the virus between March and May
2003. Sentinel herds are part of a national monitoring system to track the
movement of insect-transmitted viruses from summer to winter.
In reports so far received from farmers the virus appears to be affecting
herds between Jamberoo and Moruya.
"It's just one more kick in the guts for farmers still labouring under the
strain of drought," district vet Keith Hart said.
The virus is spread by an airborne insect similar to a mosquito (known as
the midge), infects pregnant cows, and targets the foetus. It results in
horribly deformed calves which rarely survive and have no marketability.
The infected foetus usually has misshapen limbs and brain damage. It can
also affect the cow which, after the difficult birth due to the limb
deformities, often [cannot] recover.
The virus can not be passed from animal to animal and it does not affect
humans.
Jamberoo Valley farmer Mark Honey is watching one of his cows slowly die
after giving birth to an infected calf. "This is one of the lowest points
in my dairy farming career," he admitted on Friday. "The calf was born last
week with curly limbs and without a brain. Now the mother has just lost
condition and is unlikely to survive."
The farm has been passed through generations of Honeys since 1839.
"We are still crippled by feed costs and now we have this outbreak," he
said. "I recently bought my neighbour's herd of 160 cattle, on top of mine,
so the timing is bad. But there is just no good time in the industry for
this to happen," Mr Honey said.
The problem was not only the loss of one calf so far and the likelihood of
losing the mother, but also the cost of vet fees for the difficult
delivery. Mr Honey is looking at losing nearly 2000 AUD (1334 USD) for one
infection, which is an indication of potential losses for farmers.
Vet Peter Davis, whose partner David Chaffey delivered the Honey calf, said
he knew of at least 6 other calf losses in the valley. "The only defence
for farmers was insect protection for each head of cattle, but this is not
really practical because it wears off too quickly," he said.
Mr Hart, who works with the Moss Vale Rural Lands Protection Board, said
tests on both Nowra and Exeter sentinel herds showed there has been a
pretty good strike rate.
"This insect doesn't spread well in dry conditions, so given the drought we
were not expecting an outbreak this year. But it seems the heavy autumn
rains may have contributed to the problem."
He said farmers on the South Coast had been issued a virus alert but
nothing much could be done at this stage.
"All we can do is to make them aware of the virus and the possible
difficult births ahead in an attempt to save the mothers' lives, because
nothing can be done for infected foetuses," Mr Hart said. "It's just
another woe for already overburdened farmers. If the outbreak is
significant then it follows the cost will also be significant. It's now
just a case of sitting and waiting."

[Akabane virus, an arthropod-borne Bunyavirus, is the major cause of
epizootics of congenital malformations in ruminants in Australia, Japan,
Korea, and Israel, and is suspected to be a cause of sporadic outbreaks
elsewhere. The distribution of Akabane disease is determined by that of its
vectors. The virus was first identified in Japan in 1961, but is now
believed to be distributed through 2 large north-south geographical bands:
firstly from Japan through Southeast Asia to Australia, and secondly from
the Middle East through Africa to South Africa. Clinical Akabane disease
tends to occur only near the northern and southern extremities of these
geographical bands, or in susceptible stock introduced to the endemic areas.
Blood-sucking insects, such as biting midges, transmit the virus
horizontally to vertebrates. Climatic factors influence the seasonal
activity and geographic range of the vector population and, therefore,
occurrence of related disease. Inoculated ruminants seroconvert rapidly
after a short subclinical viremia. Infection is of consequence only if
ruminants are pregnant and not protected by adequate specific neutralizing
antibodies. In naive pregnant animals, virus may spread hematogenously to
replicate and persist in trophoblastic cells of placental cotyledons and
subsequently invade the fetus. A distinct tropism for immature rapidly
dividing cells of the fetal central nervous system and skeletal muscle
results in direct virus-induced necrotizing encephalomyelitis and
polymyositis. If fetuses survive, such injury may manifest as
arthrogryposis, hydranencephaly, porencephaly, microencephaly,
hydrocephalus, or encephalomyelitis at term.
The earlier in gestation that fetal infection occurs, the more severe the
lesions, reflecting the large population of vulnerable cells and lack of
fetal immunocompetency at earlier stages of pregnancy. Injury during the
period of critical cell migration and differentiation in organogenesis may
substantially disrupt structural development in target organs. Late
gestational infections cause nonsuppurative inflammation in the brain and
spinal cord, premature birth, or fetal death with stillbirth or abortion.
Affected neonates are nonviable. The only risk factor relevant to disease
is pregnancy.
Killed vaccine has been produced in Australia and Japan and has been used
to prevent disease by protecting susceptible cows during pregnancy in areas
at great risk. Though such vaccination is not always justified
economically, in circumstances such as the one prevailing in the case under
discussion, it might have been justifiable, provided carried out at the
onset of the vector activity season.
Akabane viral infections must be differentiated from infections with other
teratogenic viruses (including related Bunyaviruses, which have been
identified in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres), inherited
conditions, and maternal intoxications. Diagnosis is made by serology,
viral isolation, and antigen detection. The damaged foetus or neonate does
not normally contain virus.
The currently described cases in Australia are located at the fringe of the
usual distribution range of the vector, _Culicoides brevitarsis_, namely at
the southern boundary of the area endemically infected. Sporadic outbreaks
of arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly in newborn calves and lambs, almost
certainly caused by Akabane virus, had been observed in southeastern New
South Wales (NSW) as early as the mid-1940s and continue to occur at
irregular intervals. Though in Australia and Japan calves are most commonly
affected, while Akabane disease is rarely diagnosed in other species, a
major epizootic in northern Israel in 1969/70 affected large numbers of
ovines and caprines besides dairy cattle; about 3000 calves, 700 lambs, and
600 kids were reportedly affected. Such a major outbreak has not recurred
there since, though sporadic cases, mainly in cattle, do occur.
The herd in Nowra (NSW), about 200 km south of Sydney, has been serving as
a sentinel herd for almost 30 years; data on seroconversions in the same
location can be seen on a map included in a 1976 paper by Della-Porta et
al: "Congenital bovine epizootic arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly in
Australia. Distribution of antibodies to Akabane virus in Australian Cattle
after the 1974 epizootic", Aust Vet J. 52 (11): 496-501.
Akabane and the related Aino virus do not cause disease in humans.
