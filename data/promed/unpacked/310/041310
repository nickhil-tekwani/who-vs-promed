3 skeletons of monkeys were found in Almas, in May 2014
--------------------------------------------
After finding the bones of monkeys in southeastern Tocantins [state, Brazil], the Health Department of the State (SESAU) issued a bulletin warning municipalities to intensify immunization of the population against yellow fever [YF]. The reason for the alert is suspected circulation of the virus disease in the region.

According to the veterinarian and analyst in the SESAU zoonoses control, Emmanuel da Silva, in May [2014] skeletons of a howler, a capuchin monkey and a marmoset monkey were found in Almas. Last week [beginning 7 Jul 2014], another howler monkey skeleton was found in Taguatinga [in Tocantins]. [For the bones to have been picked clean, as in the photo of the source article taken in May 2014, death must have occurred about a month previously. - Mod. PMB].

To verify that the monkeys have the virus, the SASAU technicians will go to Taguatinga between 21-25 Jul [2014]. "We will catch the primates and collect blood to see if they are infected. Also, technical training for the council will be held," said the veterinarian.

According to the Director of the state Dengue and Yellow Fever [Unit], Christiane Bueno, the death of monkeys is the 1st indication of possible [YF] virus circulation, which can be transmitted to humans. The recommendation is that all people go to health clinics to receive vaccination against yellow fever. Tocantins is in a region at risk for the disease, according to Christiane.

Cases of the disease
--------------------
According to the veterinarian, from 1999-2000, 22 cases of yellow fever in humans in Tocantins were recorded. Of these, 9 people died, but after this period there were no more reported cases of the disease in humans.

"Every year we recorded small numbers of cases of yellow fever in animals. During 2008, we observed a burst of events, when 39 primates died in the state. This explosion happens every 7 years, which means that in 2014 and 2015 the cycle restarts; thus the warning," adds the veterinarian.

Silva says that the disease is transmitted to humans through mosquitoes infected by the virus. "If people do not get immunized, and enter the forest where the vectors are, they can be infected. [YF] virus is more aggressive than dengue, and the person can die in 7 days." The monkey is the reservoir of the virus. The veterinarian said that the rural and urban population should be immunized every 10 years. The vaccine is free and available in all clinics to individuals from 9 months old on. [WHO recently indicated that the vaccination is good for life, with no re-vaccination required.]

[Epizootic surveillance is one of the main pillars in yellow fever (YF) surveillance. When they occur, epizootics must be considered a potential sentinel event (suggesting virus circulation) making an eventual prediction for the occurrence of human cases of the disease in a given locality, including perturbed environments. Because of this, actions are complex and involve the investigation of the deaths of primates, identifying viral circulation (through serum surveys, for example), active surveillance of human cases (syndromic surveillance would be a strategy), control of vector infestation and vaccination. - Mod.RNA (transl. Mod.TY)]

[Sylvan YF is endemic in extensive areas in Brazil and is endemic in the South American tropics. Cases occur sporadically in Brazil, with dead monkeys as the indicators of the occurrence of YF virus transmission in given localities. A rapid response, as indicated in the report above, is essential to prevent spill-over of the sylvan virus transmission cycle into the urban cycle with rapid transmission by _Aedes aegypti_, as occurred in Paraguay in 2008 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080308.0949).

[2 monkeys (capuchins, by the look of the remains in the photo in the source) were found dead in the road in April 2014 in Gurupi, south Tocantins; see http://g1.globo.com/to/tocantins/noticia/2014/04/macacos-sao-encontrados-mortos-e-agentes-suspeitam-de-febre-amarela.html [in Portuguese] and a detailed map at http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/to/TO.GIF/matatocantins.jpg. Gurupi is a white dot near the bottom.

The 200 residents of the area were offered yellow fever vaccination in case the monkeys had died of YF. The monkeys could have been run over, not dead of disease, but the precaution was justified because of the long history of monkey deaths associated with YF in Brazil. The authorities are now recommending that the population of the whole state be vaccinated.

WHO's yellow fever vaccination requirements and recommendations say yellow fever vaccination is "recommended for all travelers 9 months of age or older going to the following areas: the entire states of Acre, Amapa, Amazonas, Distrito Federal (including the capital city of Brasilia), Goias, Maranhao, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Para, Rondonia, Roraima, ***Tocantins; and designated areas of the following states: Bahia, Parana, Piaui, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Sao Paulo (state). Vaccination is also recommended for travelers visiting Iguazu Falls (http://www.who.int/ith/chapters/ith2012en_countrylist.pdf?ua=1). In Brazil, vaccination is free and available nationwide at the State Secretariats for Health and posts of Anvisa (National Agency for Health Surveillance).
