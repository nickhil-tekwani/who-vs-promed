2001/044 - Phytosanitary incident: _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_sepedonicus_ found in imported potatoes in Finland [edited
--------------------------------------------------
In Finland, in March and April 2000, 3 seed potato lots (_Solanum
tuberosum_ cv. Velox) were imported from Germany [which tested negative
for _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ (EPPO A2 quarantine
pest) by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). During summer 2000, these lots were
then cultivated [on 3 Finnish farms. In November 2000, one tuber showing
visual symptoms of potato ring rot was observed [on a farm. [It tested
positive by IFA and PCR. [All other seed lots of Velox from 3 farms
concerned were found to be infected. These farms specialized in seed
potato production. For several years, they have only [grown officially
inspected seed potatoes, and their whole potato production has [been tested
annually for latent infections. Until this incident, the disease had never
been found. It was concluded that the only possible source of infestation
was the [importation of infected seed potatoes from Germany. According to
Directive 93/85/EEC, strict eradication measures are being applied.

[According to Jukka Tegel, Head of the Laboratory, Plant Production
Inspection Center, Helsinki, the only explanation for the ring rot outbreak
was that the seed, originally imported from Germany, was infected with the
ring rot pathogen but it was not detected by testing upon arrival in
Finland. The disease was detected later in the growing season when ware
potatoes were tested. Ring rot disease has been present in Finland for
about 30 years despite a continual eradication program. The disease is
still present to some extent in ware potato production but the seed
production system is free of the disease. - Mod.DH
