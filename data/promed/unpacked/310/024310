Foot-and-mouth hits second S. African province
-----------------------------------------------
JOHANNESBURG: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has surfaced in a second
province in South Africa, 3 months after the highly-contagious virus was
first detected in farm animals in this area, an official said. Mpumalanga
borders KwaZulu-Natal province, where some 7,000 farm animals have been
slaughtered since the virus was first detected at a pig farm in September.
Several cows slaughtered from a farm near the town of Middelburg, in
Mpumalanga province, tested positive Wednesday for the virus, Mpumalanga
Agricultural Union president Lourie Bosman said.
The disease, which is relatively harmless to humans but deadly to
cloven-hoofed animals, has already cost South Africa millions of dollars in
canceled meat exports. Bosman said further tests were to be carried out on
10,000 cows and 54,000 pigs at the affected farm and others nearby.
Infected animals would be slaughtered and all other animals would be
vaccinated, Bosman said.
The strain of FMD detected in Mpumalanga was different to the one in
KwaZulu-Natal, he added."The strain identified (at the farm) is not the
same as the KwaZulu-Natal strain, which was a foreign one," he said. "At
the moment we're not quite sure where this infection comes from," he said,
adding it appeared to be a local strain. KwaZulu's FMD outbreak apparently
came from pig swill bought from a foreign ship. FMD is endemic in parts of
Mpumalanga near the Kruger National Park game reserve, where game animals
are infected, and animal movement is strictly controlled in this area.
However, the Middelburg area fell outside the endemic region, Bosman said.
The province did not export a lot of meat, but a spread of the outbreak
would be "disastrous," he said. More than 30 countries, including 15 from
the European Union, have imposed full or partial bans on meat products from
KwaZulu-Natal. The outbreak in that province was the first in South Africa,
outside of the endemic region, since 1952. Authorities in the province have
embarked on a mass vaccination program of some 1.3 million animals.

[FMD can affect human beings, but it is relatively harmless, much like a
bad cold virus. There have been approximately 40 documented human cases
since 1921.
We would like to know the strain of the current outbreak. Is it O, A, or C?
