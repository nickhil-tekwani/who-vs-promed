The death of several head of cattle due to foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the last few weeks in Kolar district [Karnataka state] has caused panic among farmers.

Though the exact figures are not available from officials of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Sciences, it was estimated that more than 100 head of cattle died of the disease in the last month [August to September 2013]. Of these, 29 cases were reported from Kolar town and 19 from Rachenahalli in Malur taluk [a subdivision of a district].

In Doddagurki village in Mulbagal taluk, 23 head of cattle, 40 goats and 4 buffaloes died of the disease. A total of 5 head of cattle died in Beechagondanahalli, 7 in Vanarasi and 8 in Gaddekannur, all in Kolar taluk. However, according to farmers, the actual number of deaths is more.

The visit of Additional Director of the department Nagaraj Shetty and 2 experts from the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Devaraj and Rashmi, a couple of days ago to the district following complaints about the spread of the disease brought to the fore the difference of opinion among officials and staff over vaccination to help prevent the disease.

The team noticed that calves and sheep were also suffering from fever at Vanarasi.

Some officials put the blame on farmers for not getting their livestock vaccinated 2 times in a year as a precautionary measure. They abstained from getting their livestock vaccinated due to some superstitious beliefs, the officials said. However, insiders in the department allege that officers and staff evinced no interest in motivating farmers to get their livestock vaccinated.

[Another team] visited several areas to take stock of the situation. Blood samples were collected from cattle and sheep. Some cattle-rearing farmers explained to the team that they had to spend thousands of rupees daily to get a cure for the suffering livestock. "The government should supply medicines free," the farmers demanded. Kolar Zilla Kurubara Horata Samiti president Tyagaraj Muddappa alleged that veterinarians collected money from farmers for vaccination which ought to be given free. Such doctors should be suspended, he demanded.

"The department officials have failed in creating awareness about vaccination. They did not take the issue seriously," a farmer alleged during an interaction with officials at Vanarasi. Mr. Shetty appealed to the farmers to shed superstitious beliefs and get their cattle vaccinated to save them. Deputy Commissioner D.K. Ravi has directed the authorities not to sit idle on the pretext that farmers were not showing interest. "Find out alternative ways to motivate farmers to get their cattle vaccinated," he said.
