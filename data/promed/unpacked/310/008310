The foodborne illness outbreak that sickened at least 60 recipients of a meal at the Denver Rescue Mission in July 2012 has been linked to turkey contaminated with _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteria, officials say.

According to the Denver Department of Environmental Health, a stool sample from an outbreak victim tested positive for [staphylococcus], pointing to that bacterium as the cause of illness. This discovery matches up with the fact that victims became ill within an hour after eating.

While other dishes such as mashed potatoes and a vegetable side were served at the 22 Jul 2012 dinner, the turkey was the suspected source of contamination, since evidence suggests that it was not handled according to sanitation standards.

"Poor hygienic practices were linked with preparation of that turkey, as well as temperature abuse after it was prepared," said Danica Lee, Program Manager at the Denver Department of Environmental Health in an interview with Food Safety News.

Staphylococcus bacteria are usually found on the skin and nasal passages of humans. They can grow in foods kept at improper temperatures, and cause illness if ingested.

Officials say this incident was strictly due to improper handling and not to previous contamination, therefore there is no risk of more illnesses linked to the outbreak. "We have no reason to believe it was anything other than an isolated incident where organizational practices in handling of the food were not followed," says Environmental Public Health Food Supervisor, Abby Davidson in a statement. "These practices were documented and immediately corrected by the Denver Rescue Mission's leadership and staff."

[Classical food poisoning due to _Staphylococcus aureus_ presents with a short incubation period of 4-6 hours as acute nausea and vomiting usually without fever or diarrhea. The illness generally lasts less than 24 hours.

The following information regarding this entity is extracted from the USA FDA's Bad Bug Book at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodSafety/FoodborneIllness/FoodborneIllnessFoodbornePathogensNaturalToxins/BadBugBook/ucm070015.htm

In the diagnosis of staphylococcal foodborne illness, proper interviews with the victims and the gathering and analyzing of epidemiological data, are essential. Incriminated foods should be collected and examined for staphylococci. The presence of relatively large numbers of enterotoxigenic staphylococci is good circumstantial evidence that the food contains toxin. The most conclusive test is the linking of an illness with a specific food, or, in cases where multiple vehicles exist, the detection of the toxin in the food sample(s).

In cases where the food may have been treated to kill the staphylococci, as in pasteurization or heating, direct microscopic observation of the food may be an aid in the diagnosis. A number of serological methods for determining the enterotoxigenicity of _S. aureus_ isolated from foods, as well as methods for the separation and detection of toxins in foods, have been developed, and used successfully, to aid in the diagnosis of the illness. Phage typing may also be useful when viable staphylococci can be isolated from the incriminated food, from victims, and from suspected carriers, such as food handlers.

A toxin dose of less than 1.0 microgram in contaminated food will produce symptoms of staphylococcal intoxication. This toxin level is reached when _S. aureus_ populations exceed 100 000 per gram.

Foods that are frequently incriminated in staphylococcal food poisoning include meat and meat products; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and chocolate eclairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products. Foods that require considerable handling during preparation, and that are kept at slightly elevated temperatures after preparation, are frequently involved in staphylococcal food poisoning. - Mod.LL
