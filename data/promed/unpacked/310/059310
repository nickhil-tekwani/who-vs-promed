A Sha Tin kindergarten that was closed to control an outbreak of
chickenpox, which is said to have contributed to the death of a
5-year- old boy from scarlet fever, should have been closed for more
than a week, international experts said.

The Centre for Health Protection requested the Salvation Army Tin Ka
Ping Kindergarten in Sha Tin, to close for 7 days from last Wednesday
[22 Jun 2011]. Classes are expected to resume tomorrow [28 Jun 2011].

So far 12 out of 400 pupils, including the boy, have come down with
chickenpox. He [the 5-year-old boy] contracted scarlet fever and died
from a related complication of toxic shock. But infectious diseases
experts, who have been closely monitoring the outbreak of scarlet
fever, said it would be wise to close the outbreak school "for more
than one week" because the incubation period of the chickenpox virus
could be up to 4 weeks.

Members of the International Society for Infectious Diseases have
expressed concern in internet forums [ProMED-mail] over the outbreak
of scarlet fever, caused by the bacterium Group A _Streptococcus
pyogenes_.

Miami-based pediatrician Allen Lenoir noted that streptococcal toxic
shock is recognized as a "potentially fatal complication of
chickenpox," caused by the varicella virus [see ProMED-mail post
Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - China (05): (HK, MO) 20110625.1946]. "Is it known how many of the other cases have been
associated with varicella infections?" he asked. "Since the incubation
period for varicella can be up to 3 weeks [4 if the child has received
immunoglobulin] it might be necessary to close the involved schools
for more than one week."

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called for
children to be vaccinated against chickenpox to control any outbreak,
or it could last "as long as 4 to 5 months," the society [Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices] said [see CDC. Prevention of
Varicella. Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP). MMWR 2007; 56(RR04); 1-40. Available at
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5604a1.htm#tab1].

Steve Berger, a geographic medicine specialist in the Tel Aviv
Medical Center in Israel, also noted that the rates of scarlet fever
in Hong Kong have been increasing during the past decade [ProMED-mail
post Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - China (06): (HK, MO) 20110626.1953]. Only 6 fatal cases were recorded between 1946 and
2006, the last in 1970, he said.

The 2 deaths this year [2011] therefore were the first in 41 years.

This afternoon (Mon 27 Jun 2011) the Controller of the Centre for
Health Protection Thomas Tsang Ho-fair held a press stand-up on the
latest situation and disclosed the serotype of the strains, as
follows: tests of 97 bacterial samples show the dominant strain to be
M12: 50 of them belong to M12, 16 have M1, and 8 are M28.

70-80 percent of M12 has the new mutated gene (referred to in our
earlier report), which is antibiotic-resistant, while some of the M1
have it as well. No details [were given] on M28.

[The Hong Kong outbreak group A streptococcal isolates are
predominantly serotype M12, with smaller numbers of M1 and M28. M1 and
M12 are known to be prevalent serotypes in several regions, such as
North America and Taiwan. Serotype M28 isolates are overrepresented
among cases of puerperal sepsis and neonatal group A streptococcal
infections, but they also cause other types of invasive infections and
pharyngitis (http://expasy.org/sprot/hamap/STRPM.html). However,
further genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular
methods such as multilocus sequence typing, ribotyping, pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and random amplified polymorphic DNA
(RAPD) analysis will be necessary to see if there are common outbreak
strains. For further discussion of group A _Streptococcus_ genotyping,
see ProMED-mail post Streptococcus group A, scarlet fever - China
