Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome in Afghanistan - Update
----------------------------------------------------------
To date, there have been 27 suspected cases, including 16 deaths reported
from an isolated village in Gulran district, Herat Province, Afghanistan
(see previous report). An international team, including experts from the
WHO Collaborating Centre at the National Institute for Virology (NIV- South
Africa), Epicentre and WHO have completed their investigation. Extensive
virologic and serologic tests for a wide variety of pathogens have not yet
identified the etiologic agent.

[This report sheds no further light on the etiology of the outbreak. The
negative outcome of the investigations so far must be presumed to reflect
the technical difficulties encountered rather than the appearance of a
novel pathogen. - Mod.CP
