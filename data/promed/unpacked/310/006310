They may want to look at the way too much sulphur affects the other minerals' utilization/uptake. It's very complex and interactive.

Death after lambing reminds me of losing Saanen does after kidding. 1 in particular had almost zero copper. She was "fine" until a couple of days after kidding. The assay, which included other serious mineral deficiencies, was done on the liver.

[ProMED-mail's toxicologist moderator TG confirms: Sulfur binds to copper and other minerals; It is likely having an effect. They should run a mineral panel on these animals.

On 28 Jul 2015, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority stated that blood samples from the sheep had been sent to Norway for testing, with the results expected around the end of July 2015.(see 20150730.3546935).

The information included in the mentioned results would be very much appreciated. - Mod.AS
