In response to the 2 postings above:

The moderator and M Gilbert duly note a repeated pattern of spring H5N1
outbreaks in wild birds in Qinghai (China) followed by outbreaks in central
Mongolia (years 2005, 2006, and potentially 2009).

Bar-headed geese _Anser indicus_ comprised the bulk of deaths in 2005 and
2006. Results from our telemetry studies of bar-headed geese and ruddy
shelduck _Tadorna ferruginea_ marked at Qinghai Lake in 2007 and 2008 show
a spring migratory connection between Qinghai Lake (stopover site) and
breeding areas in central Mongolia (Arkhangai province). This is the 1st
documentation of its kind (ref 1).

The timing of migration (including use of Qinghai wetlands in April before
migration to Mongolia breeding areas in early to mid-May), supports
hypothesis of the potential for wild bird transmission between the 2
regions (Kilpatrick et al, 2006). H5N1 challenge studies (Brown et al,
2008) of bar-headed geese infected with A/whooper swan/Mongolia/244/2005
(H5N1) showed mixed results with 2 of 5 infected individuals dying within
6-7d of infection. However, despite extensive global surveillance efforts
over the past few years, detection of HPAI in healthy wild birds has been
extremely rare, challenging the hypothesis that wild birds can effectively
spread the disease. Continued efforts to understand HPAI virus dynamics
within its wild bird host range is important to understanding the potential
for transmission of H5N1 and related viruses, particularly given the recent
emergence of 2009 H1N1.
