[Once again reviewing reports for cases and positive environmental samples since 1 Jan 2021, there have been cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) associated with circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV) confirmed in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Congo, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar (cVDPV1), Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Tajikistan, and Yemen (cVDPV1) (cases associated with cVDPV2 in all but Madagascar and Yemen). Counties with no AFP confirmed cases but positive environmental samples (ES) for cVDPV2 include Egypt, Kenya, Somalia, and newly added to this list are Gambia and Uganda.

Equally disconcerting is the increase in confirmed cases of AFP associated with cVDPV2 in Nigeria with cases reported in Jigawa, Yobe, Borno, Adamawa, and Bauchi, raising the number of 2021 cases to 49. Noting that cases in other African countries have been associated with the Jigawa outbreak (Benin, Burkina Faso, and now Gambia), the increase in cases in Jigawa is of increased concern.

Interpretation: cVDPV transmission/circulation continues in 16 African countries, 4 Eastern Mediterranean regions, and 1 European region country. It appears as though transmission in Nigeria continues to increase. For a map of Nigeria showing states, see https://nigerianfinder.com/map-of-nigeria-states/.

While there were no positive AFP cases or positive environmental samples for WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1), it has only been 3 weeks since the last positive environmental sample in Pakistan was reported (Poliomyelitis update (14): Global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2, cVDPV1) 20210708.8505008).

Globally, right now, the risk of disease from the vaccine is greater than the risk from the disease from the wild virus.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

[2] Pakistan: no WPV1 AFP cases in 6 months
Date: Tue 27 Jul 2021
Source: The News [edited]
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/869375-pakistan-reports-no-polio-case-in-six-months%3E


Pakistan reported no case of polio in the past 6 months, which has never happened before.

According to the focal person for polio eradication Brigadier Shehzad Baig, Pakistan has come closest ever to achieve the goal of polio eradication with no wild polio cases in the last 6 months and consistent decline in the number of positive environmental samples. The geographic distribution of the virus has been confined only to a few areas, the official explained.

A report on the status of polio by the ministry of health states that the polio eradication programme has achieved similar results in the past at least once (having low case count), but the significant decrease in the virus in the environment simultaneously is unique and heartening. It indicates that the virus is under immense pressure and finding it difficult to survive in the majority of the areas, says the report.

The News has also learned from the official that novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) is also being introduced in the country after being approved by DRAP [Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan].

Secretary Health Amir Khuwaja told The News that the challenges still exist such as missed children, refusals, and negative propagandas, but he assured that the authorities are making all requisite efforts to overcome these obstacles.

Explaining about the efforts being put in place, Mr Shehbaz briefed that to strengthen campaign operations, active community engagement and roll-out of integrated health services in high-risk areas were being ensured. He elaborated that they have been vaccinating the repeatedly missed children especially in core reservoirs of transmission as an effort to completely wipe out the virus from the country. "Program to eradicate polio is implementing all the key strategies to ensure high-quality campaigns," the incumbent said. Further, additional teams for permanent and temporary transit points have been trained and deployed, The News has learned. He also revealed that orientation of DCs [deputy commissioners] of key districts will also be planned this month.

More than 33 million children under 5 years received their vaccination during the subnational anti-polio campaign, according to the health ministry. The campaign was conducted from 7-11 Jun [2021] in 124 districts of the country, including all 4 provinces, Azad Jammu Kashmir, and the federal capital Islamabad.

More than 225 000 "Sehat Tahafuz" frontline workers visited families and caregivers during the campaign to ensure vaccination of children from the crippling poliovirus.

According to another report, Dr Shahzad Baig said that with the great support of parents and communities, the programme achieved the campaign target; however, now is not the time for complacency. The current gains of the programme are fragile and can easily be reversed, especially during the upcoming season when the virus is especially active," said Dr. Shahzad Baig.

[While the article states there have been no polio cases in Pakistan in 6 months, I've taken the liberty to qualify that statement as referring to AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases associated with WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) infection, as there have been 8 cases of AFP associated with cVDPV2 (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2), with the date of onset of the most recent case 23 Apr 2021 (https://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/weekly-polio-analyses-cVDPV-20210720.pdf). In addition, there have been 59 isolates of WPV1 in Pakistan from non-AFP cases (including asymptomatic infections and environmental samples) during 2021 to date, with the most recent positive isolate obtained on 18 Jun 2021, indicative of continued circulation of the virus. The presence of cVDPV2-associated AFP cases, which is indicative of pockets of susceptibles in the country, along with other sources (asymptomatic individuals and environmental samples) positive for WPV1 means it is premature to celebrate interruption of WPV1 transmission in the country.

The growing concern being expressed by Nigerians over the outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in 13 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) should not be treated lightly. Much as it seemed to have taken the country by surprise, the outbreak of this polio variant is outrightly unfortunate considering the huge funds expended on polio eradication. According to health professionals, this outbreak is worrisome, as it threatens Nigeria's wild-poliovirus-free status even as it is likely to compound the nation's wobbly healthcare delivery system.

Recent reports stated that the Executive Director of the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency (NPHCDA), Dr Faisal Shuaib, confirmed the cVDPV2 outbreaks in the FCT, Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Lagos, Niger, Rivers, Sokoto, Yobe, Zamfara, Abia, Bayelsa, Borno, and Delta states. Shuaib was also said to have noted that the agency had conducted 4 outbreak response strategies (OBRs) using the novel oral polio vaccine.

Although polio (poliomyelitis) has endured so much controversy in the politics of global healthcare, it should be emphasised that its virulent and deadly nature has not abated. Medical experts have described polio as a highly infectious viral disease that invades the nervous system and is capable of causing irreversible paralysis in a matter of hours. According to the Polio Global Eradication Initiative, "Polio is spread through person-to-person contact. When a child is infected with wild poliovirus, the virus enters the body through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. It is then shed into the environment through the faeces, where it can spread rapidly through a community, especially in situations of poor hygiene and sanitation."

Given the nature of transmission, through foods and drinks contaminated with infected faeces and the symptomless state of infected persons [and person-to-person transmission related to suboptimal handwashing conditions and most likely oropharyngeal droplet spread - Mod.MPP] the World Health Organisation (WHO) considers a single confirmed case of polio paralysis to be evidence of an epidemic.

All this calls for concern, especially at a time the Ministry of Health and its stakeholders are grappling with the possibility of a 3rd wave and the deadly delta variant of the COVID-19. It also leads us to ask: What is it that Nigeria did not do right when it was claimed that polio had been eradicated? What lessons can we learn from polio to address other pandemic outbreaks like COVID-19?

Indeed, with her resources, Nigeria has no reason to be a polio state. It would be recalled that Nigeria, on 25 Aug 2020, became the last country in Africa to be certified free from wild polio after the last reported case in Borno in 2016. However, in these precarious times of healthcare management, when health workers are overwhelmed with COVID-19 management, Nigeria must do all it can to jealously guard its WPV-free status and stop the cVDPV2 transmission in communities. Whilst the wild poliovirus (WPV) is the most common form of poliovirus, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, or cVDPV, is another form of polio that can spread within communities, which Nigeria is currently experiencing.

As the WHO has advised, immunisation with the appropriate vaccines remains the most potent prevention measure against polio. This being the case, the government health authorities and community leaders must work together to ensure that children in the affected states are properly immunised.

Nearly a decade ago, when Nigeria was embroiled in the polio controversy leading to the death of foreign medical workers and immunisation officers in Kano State, experts and stakeholders implicated clerics and journalists suspected to have been at the forefront of misinformation. Given the recent outbreak and its widespread nature, it is not unlikely that such atavistic sentiments would be recalled. In readiness for such, Nigerians must guard against paid hirelings who may be deployed to foment trouble.

This is where those at the forefront of information gathering and dissemination, especially clerics, community leaders, and journalists, should demonstrate a high level of information management. As they have always been reminded, they should be conscious of the moral demands of their roles to the community and society at large.

Like COVID-19 and like malaria, polio is a health issue. Nigerians, either as individuals or as a collective, must strip themselves of cultural and religious inhibitions that make them victims of not only polio but also of other endemic afflictions. Community must eschew all forms of politicisation of polio for political gains. Concerted efforts should be made to discourage misinterpretation of immunisation exercises. Therefore, it behooves them to eschew all subversive tendencies and inclinations towards disinformation and misinformation.

In states where polio cases have been reported, government should empower their local government officials to mobilise traditional chieftains and community and religious leaders to sensitise their fold on the resurgence of polio. Whilst polio is prevalent amongst children aged 5 and below, it can infect persons of any age. Therefore, beyond conscious aggressive immunisation of children in affected areas, there should also be emphasis on good sanitation. This is very crucial because poverty and poor sanitation are becoming widespread with the dwindling economy and dismal healthcare regulation. Besides, communities need to partner with philanthropic or charity organisations and harness resources towards a polio-free country.
