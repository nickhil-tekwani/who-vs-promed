After having successfully expelled the Ebola virus, Nigeria now faces another health challenge, as an outbreak of Lassa fever has been reported in Oyo state, South West Nigeria.

The announcement was reportedly made by the state's commissioner of health, Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, who said that as many as 10 cases had been reported.

"We are already working to bring it under control. We are doing the best to curtail it. We have what it takes to manage it very well. I only want to appeal to our people to be very hygienic, and when they feel that something is wrong with our system, we should go to the hospital for proper diagnosis of their sickness and treatment," Gbadegesin said.

Lassa fever or Lassa hemorrhagic fever (LHF) is an acute viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus and was 1st described in 1969 in the town of Lassa, in Borno State, Nigeria.

[A medical worker in Oyo state was infected with Lassa virus earlier this year (20 Feb 2014), indicating that transmission of this virus was active in Oyo state (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140222.2294417) and apparently continues.

As noted in the 2014 ProMED-mail posts on Lassa fever in Nigeria cited below, Lassa fever virus is endemic in Nigeria and is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country. As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived report 20130131.1524034: "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multi-system disease. Exceptionally, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients."

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contacts with food or household items contaminated with excreta of multimammate rats (_Mastomys_ spp.). Virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments or laboratories in the absence of adequate infection control measures. Because elimination of these rodents is not possible currently, reduction of risk of human infections can be accomplished, but eradication of the virus in these endemic areas cannot be.
