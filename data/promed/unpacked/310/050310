There is a [health] alert in the area due to the 19 cases of this virus [disease].

Yesterday, the death of a Salta policeman was confirmed.

Dr. Pedro Cortada, Chief of Epidemiology of the San Vicente de Paul Hospital, confirmed 19 cases of the disease [caused by a virus] transmitted by rats when we are just entering April, with the previous seasonal averages of 30 [cases] per year.

Specifically, of the 19 registered cases, 16 are from the Oran hospital service area, 1 is from Pichanal, 1 is from Colonia Santa Rosa, and 1 is from Bolivia. Concerning the Oran situation, the majority of the infected individuals are known to have come from a rural area, but there are also cases involving people who live in neighborhoods or remote settlements that border forests. Among all these cases, there is 1 death.

[The fatal case mentioned above is likely the same one reported in the previous ProMED-mail post of 2 days ago (7 Apr 2015, archive no. 20150408.3285307). However, that post mentioned only 5 cases in the Oran area, whereas this post reports 19 cases. As mentioned in the previous post, the hantavirus involved in these cases is likely Oran hantavirus that occurs in northwestern Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in any of these cases.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_, is available at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio.htm.
