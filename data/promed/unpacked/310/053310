Another 2-dozen cases of mumps are being reported in Nova Scotia,
bringing the total to 326 since the outbreak began in February
[2007]. Medical officer of health, Dr. Robert Strang, has already
said the peak of the outbreak is over but, as part of the normal
cycle, more cases can be expected for weeks or months to come. And
Strang says there's the possibility of an "upswing" in mumps cases in
September [2007], when university students return to classes.
Strang says a vaccination program is being considered for students
and a meeting has been scheduled for next week with the presidents of
the province's universities.
The majority of cases have occurred in people between the ages of 20
and 25. The outbreak in Nova Scotia has also been linked to cases in
other provinces. In New Brunswick, there have been dozens of cases.
