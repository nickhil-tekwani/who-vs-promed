Helsingin Sanomat, the leading Finnish newspaper, reported on 26 Feb
2009 that 4 elderly people in Denmark had died due to complications
of salmonellosis. According to the report the source of the infection
had been sausages made of pork and the contamination had been traced
to 2 slaughterhouses, one in Sjaelland [Zealand] and one in Jylland
[Jutland]. One of the slaughterhouses had exported considerable
amounts of the contaminated meat. Unexpectedly there have been no
reports of this in ProMED-mail.

Since October 2008, Denmark has suffered 2 big outbreaks of
salmonellosis from Danish sausages. 4 people have died as a result of
eating "medister" sausage, and at least 79 have been hospitalized
with stomach infections, according to the national disease control
center Statens Serum Institut.

Investigators have traced the deadly bacteria to 2 pork
slaughterhouses in Jutland and Zealand. However, Dr Kare Molbak of
the Statens Serum Institut says they can't be absolutely sure the
salmonella originated only in those 2 spots. The problem could be
more widespread in the nation's pork industry.

In a statement reported by the Copenhagen Post, Molbak confirmed:
"There are grounds for concern and this time we are in no doubt that
the salmonella comes from Danish pork."

But the deputy director of the Danish Meat Association, Erik Bisgaard
Madsen, insists that he's "99 per cent certain" that the salmonella
outbreak did not originate from one of his association's members.
