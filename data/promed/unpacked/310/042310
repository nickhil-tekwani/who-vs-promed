Schmallenberg virus [SBV] is believed to have spread to all counties. Figures provided to AgriLand by the Department of Agriculture indicate that SBV positive test results have been recorded in both cattle and sheep this year [2018].

Of the 311 tests (polymerase chain reaction) carried out on cattle, 6 positive results were identified. In addition, 96 tests were carried out on sheep at Regional Veterinary Laboratories, and 38 positive results were obtained [see source URL for a table presenting results from each of 7 samplings carried out between 7 Jan-18 Feb 2018].

The data also delve into where each case was identified: between January and February 2018, 13 cases were identified in Sligo, 8 in Galway, and 6 in Donegal. SBV was also found in the counties of Cork, Dublin, Kerry, Kildare, Laois, Limerick, Waterford and Westmeath in 2017 [see source URL for a table presenting the number of cases in each of the mentioned counties].

Commenting on the data, a department spokesperson said: "SBV is now believed to have effectively spread to all counties with the detection of confirmed cases in County Donegal."

Schmallenberg 1st hit Irish shores in 2012. It was transported by midges and affected flocks mainly in the southern and eastern parts of the country. It is a low-impact disease, with the potential to cause significant losses in individual herds/flocks. This is particularly the case where a substantial number of susceptible animals are infected, for the 1st time, at a vulnerable stage of gestation, especially where breeding is synchronised.

[Sheep, due to their relatively short pregnancy (5 months, compared to 9 in cattle) will be the 1st to demonstrate deformed offspring following their exposure to the SBV during pregnancy, earlier than pregnant cows that have been simultaneously exposed. On the other hand, SBV has not been reported to cause clinical signs in infected sheep during their viraemic stage, while in susceptible adult bovines, transient febrile illness and milk drop were observed subsequent to their infection (see further details at https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/diseasecontrol/schmallenbergvirus/).

SBV does not transmit directly from animal to animal, other than maternal transmission from mother to offspring in utero. There is no evidence to suggest that the virus is transmissible to humans; to date, people who have been in close contact with infected animals (such as animal workers, farmers, and veterinarians) have not reported any unusual illnesses. The disease is not officially notifiable, but OIE has been publishing reports of infections as an "emerging" disease. - Mod.AS
