An outbreak of salmonella infection has prompted an urgent recall of eggs
from the Queensland company, Game Farm Enterprises. Queensland Health
negotiated the voluntary recall with the Mount Cotton company after cracked
and dirty eggs were supplied to small retail outlets and fruit and
vegetable shops around Queensland.
It was believed the eggs were linked to a spate of _Salmonella_ poisonings
in the past few months, Queensland Health spokeswoman Dr Linda Selvey said.
Health authorities and Safe Food Queensland are investigating.
Dr Selvey said anyone who had bought eggs with Game Farm Enterprises on the
carton should either return the eggs to the place of purchase for a full
refund or dispose of them.

[The serotype of salmonellosis in this cluster is not reported.
Salmonellosis is often thought to be associated with cracked eggs or eggs
dirty with fecal matter, a problem controlled by cleaning procedures
implemented in the egg industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most
of the salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with
uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs. The
undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus were
contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed.
Queensland occupies the north east corner of the mainland continent. Its
location can be seen at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland>. - Mod.LL]
