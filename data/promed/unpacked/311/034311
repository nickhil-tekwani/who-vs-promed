Tetrodotoxin poisoning outbreak from imported dried puffer fish -- Minneapolis, Minnesota, 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 13 Jun 2014, 2 patients went to the Hennepin County Medical Center Emergency Department in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with symptoms suggestive of tetrodotoxin poisoning (that is, oral paresthesias, weakness, and dyspnea) after consuming dried puffer fish (also known as globefish) purchased during a recent visit to New York City. The patients said 2 friends who consumed the same fish had similar, although less pronounced, symptoms and had not sought care. The Minnesota Department of Health conducted an investigation to determine the source of the product and samples were sent to the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition for chemical and genetic analysis. Genetic analysis identified the product as puffer fish (_Lagocephalus lunaris_) and chemical analysis determined it was contaminated with high levels of tetrodotoxin.

A traceback investigation was unable to determine the original source of the product. Tetrodotoxin is a deadly, potent poison; the minimum lethal dose in an adult human is estimated to be 2-3 mg (1). Tetrodotoxin is a heat-stable and acid-stable, nonprotein, alkaloid toxin found in many species of the fish family Tetraodontidae (puffer fish) as well as in certain gobies, amphibians, invertebrates, and the blue-ringed octopus (2). Tetrodotoxin exerts its effects by blocking voltage-activated sodium channels, terminating nerve conduction and muscle action potentials, leading to progressive paralysis and, in extreme cases, to death from respiratory failure. Because these fish were reportedly purchased in the USA, they pose a substantial public health hazard given the potency of the toxin and the high levels of toxin found in the fish.

Case reports
------------
Patient 1: A man aged 30 years went to the emergency department (ED) with his sister (patient 2), concerned that they both might have puffer fish poisoning. The patient stated that he had purchased dried fish described as globefish from a street vendor in New York City and transported the fish to Minnesota himself. 6 hours before he came to the ED, he rehydrated some fish and consumed it with his sister and 2 friends. 30 minutes after consumption, he experienced perioral and tongue numbness, numbness, and weakness in his extremities, extreme fatigue, and dyspnea. He also complained that "my teeth can't feel themselves." Despite self-induced vomiting, his symptoms did not resolve, after which he went to the ED. He noted that his 2 friends, who also consumed the fish but did not go to the ED, had similar symptoms that resolved over several hours... The patient was observed in the ED for 6 hours, during which time his hypertension and tachypnea resolved and his symptoms improved. Overnight observation was recommended; however, the patient elected to leave against medical advice.

Patient 2: A woman aged 33 years, who went to the ED with her brother (patient 1), also consumed the fish 6 hours before arrival at the ED and also complained of perioral and tongue numbness, numbness, and weakness in her extremities, extreme fatigue, dyspnea, and the feeling that "my teeth can't feel themselves," all beginning 30 minutes after consuming the rehydrated fish. Her temperature was 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), pulse 71 beats/min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/74 mmHg, and blood oxygen saturation 100 percent on room air. Her physical examination was unremarkable; respiratory effort, mental status, and strength testing were normal. After 6 hours of observation in the ED, the patient's symptoms began to improve. Overnight observation was recommended but she also left against medical advice.

Laboratory analysis

Actions taken
-------------
Several attempts were made to contact patient 1 and patient 2 by telephone; however, none were successful. Visits to the 2 patients' home were made by both public health officials and law enforcement; however, current residents of the home stated that they had no knowledge of the patients' whereabouts. There was no labeling on the fish packaging, and all attempts to determine the source of the fish were unsuccessful. The Minnesota Department of Health and Department of Agriculture notified the New York City Department of Health and Department of Agriculture of the outbreak. However, with no specific information available about the source of the fish, no further investigation was feasible.

Discussion
----------
The puffer fish (sometimes called globefish, fugu, or blowfish) is highly prized in many Asian cultures and is consumed safely in some countries (such as in Japan). Consumption is safe, however, only with specialized training regarding which species to prepare and how to prepare them because the concentration and tissue distribution of toxin varies greatly among the more than 180 known species. Regulatory authorities in the USA do not provide this training, nor is tetrodotoxin testing routinely conducted; therefore, only the frozen meat, skin, and male gonad from one species of puffer fish (_Takifugu rubripes_) from Japan, processed according to Japanese safety guidelines, is permitted to be imported into the USA a limited number of times per year, pursuant to an FDA/Japanese government agreement established in 1988 (6). All other imported puffer fish products are prohibited (7). For domestic sources of puffer fish, only nontoxic species are recommended by FDA for consumption. FDA regulates domestically sourced puffer fish through the Seafood Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points regulation (5). Selected states have established additional requirements for controls for puffer fish from certain areas because of potential toxicity (8).

_Lagocephalus lunaris_ is an Indo-Pacific species of puffer fish and is one of the only species known to contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin naturally in the meat, making safe preparation of this product impossible (9). In its native region, it has been confused with similar looking, nontoxic species, resulting in numerous illnesses (10). This is the same species that was illegally imported and responsible for illnesses in California, Illinois, and New Jersey in 2007 (4).

The presence of this puffer fish species in a USA market represents a substantial public health threat given the potentially lethal toxin and the high concentration of the toxin in the flesh of these fish. However, because the 2 patients provided limited information, the source of the fish and how it was imported, in violation of current FDA import restrictions, could not be determined. Medical professionals who work in EDs or with persons from countries with a tradition of puffer fish consumption should be aware of this potential public health threat and collaborate with local poison centers and health departments to investigate any outbreaks of tetrodotoxin poisoning to determine the source of the product and block additional sales to prevent additional illnesses. FDA recently released materials, including instructions for the collection and submission of meal remnants, for several fish-related illnesses, including puffer fish poisoning.

[It is important to know that the distribution of toxin varies quite widely based on the species of puffer fish and that the fish involved here, _Lagocephalus lunaris_, is one of the only species known to contain high concentrations of tetrodotoxin naturally in the meat, making safe preparation of this product impossible.

The following was extracted from the US FDA "Bad Bug Book" http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070842.htm:

Fish poisoning by consumption of members of the order Tetraodontiformes is one of the most violent intoxications from marine species. The gonads, liver, intestines, and skin of puffer fish can contain levels of tetrodotoxin sufficient to produce rapid and violent death. The flesh of many puffer fish may not usually be dangerously toxic.

Tetrodotoxin has also been isolated from widely differing animal species, including the California newt, parrotfish, frogs of the genus _Atelopus_, the blue-ringed octopus, starfish, angelfish, and xanthid crabs. The metabolic source of tetrodotoxin is uncertain. No algal source has been identified, and until recently tetrodotoxin was assumed to be a metabolic product of the host. However, recent reports of the production of tetrodotoxin/anhydrotetrodotoxin by several bacterial species, including strains of the family _Vibrionaceae_, _Pseudomonas_ sp, and _Photobacterium phosphoreum_, point toward a bacterial origin of this family of toxins. These are relatively common marine bacteria that are often associated with marine animals. If confirmed, these findings may have some significance in toxicoses that have been more directly related to these bacterial species.

The 1st symptom of intoxication is a slight numbness of the lips and tongue, appearing between 20 minutes to 3 hours after eating poisonous puffer fish. The next symptom is increasing paresthesia [sensation of burning, numbness, tingling, itching, or prickling] in the face and extremities, which may be followed by sensations of lightness or floating. Headache, epigastric pain, nausea, diarrhea, and/or vomiting may occur. Occasionally, some reeling or difficulty in walking may occur. The 2nd stage of the intoxication is increasing paralysis. Many victims are unable to move; even sitting may be difficult. There is increasing respiratory distress. Speech is affected, and the victim usually exhibits dyspnea [shortness of breath], cyanosis [turns blue], and hypotension [drop in blood pressure]. Paralysis increases, and convulsions, mental impairment, and cardiac arrhythmia [alterations in heartbeat] may occur.

The victim, although completely paralyzed, may be conscious and in some cases completely lucid until shortly before death. Death usually occurs within 4 to 6 hours, with a known range of about 20 minutes to 8 hours. - Mod.LL
