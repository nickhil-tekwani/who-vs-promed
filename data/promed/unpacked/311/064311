Plateau State Government has disclosed that a total of 17 persons have died from a cholera outbreak in the state. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nimkong Lar, who gave the update in Jos, the state capital, yesterday, 11 Jul 2021, added that so far, 1004 suspected cases have been recorded. According to Lar, out of the 1004 suspected cases recorded in the state, 980 persons have been discharged, while 7 others were still receiving treatment in various hospitals. The commissioner stated that the affected local government areas are Jos North, Jos South, Riyom, Kanam, Bokkos, Wase, Mangu, Bassa, Jos East, Barkin Ladi, Qua'anpan, Langtang North, and Shendam.

Reassuring the people of the state government commitment to curtailing the disease from spreading further, Lar also advised the people to imbibe the act of hand washing and sanitizing their hands to avoid the spread of the highly contagious disease.

He said: "As a government, we are not relenting in our efforts to address the problem, but we also want to appeal to the public to always maintain good sanitation and shun indiscriminate dumping of waste."

[Plateau is the twelfth-largest state in Nigeria. Approximately in the centre of the country, it is geographically unique in Nigeria due to its boundaries of elevated hills surrounding the Jos Plateau, its capital, and the entire plateau itself. - Mod. LL]

The health department [Haryana state] has confirmed cholera as the reason for the death of a 9-year-old boy on Wed 14 Jul 2021 even as the number of cases in Abheypur and Budhanpur villages due to the bacterial disease burgeoned to 179. Confirming a cholera outbreak in the villages, civil surgeon Dr Mukta Kumar said the disease caused the death of [9-year-old A] in Abheypur. She said in the last 2 days, 179 patients from the 2 villages had been admitted to the Civil Hospital in Sector 6, Panchkula, after drinking contaminated water. _Vibrio cholerae_ bacteria had been found in 16 out of 18 stool samples tested. Health teams had also collected 55 water samples from the villages and reports will be out in a couple of days, she added. While the health department denied any other death, 2 admitted youths, claimed a friend, 20, also died due to the disease.

Congress leader Om Parkash claimed the water contamination started after a new pipeline was laid near the park in Abheypur. "Around 10 days ago, we complained to the HUDA officials concerned. They even visited the area, but left after saying that everything is fine." For a village with nearly 50 000 people living in over 500 houses, only 12 water tankers were provided till Thursday, he said.

At the civil hospital, wards were full with people mostly from Abheypur and some from Budhanpur. "Water is so filthy and smells so bad that you cannot stand near it. We are getting sewage water in our homes," alleged Rajesh, one of the patients. A mother of a 16-year-old patient, claimed they had been getting contaminated water for over 2 months, but it had worsened over the last 10 days.

[Haryana is a state in India located in the northern part of the country. It was carved out of the former state of East Punjab. Chandigarh is the state capital.

A number of cholera vaccines are available, but edible vaccine technology offers the potential for a cold chain-free method. The following recent Japanese publication reports on a phase 1 study actually performed in 2016 using MucoRice-CTB vaccine, a genetically modified rice strain that carries a cholera toxin B subunit antigen (the Methods section of the abstract, not included here, can be found at the URL, below):

Abstract
--------
"Background: There are an estimated 1.3-4.0 million cases of cholera and 20 000-140 000 cholera-related deaths worldwide each year. The rice-based cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) vaccine [manufactured as a powder from the transgenic rice - Mod.LL], MucoRice-CTB, is an oral candidate vaccine that does not require a cold chain, has shown efficacy in animal models, and could be of benefit in places where there is a paucity of medical infrastructure. We aim to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MucoRice-CTB in humans.

"Findings: Between 23 Jun 2015 and 31 May 2016, 226 participants were recruited and assessed for eligibility. 166 participants were excluded based on health condition or schedule. We then randomly selected 60 male volunteers aged 20-40 years who were enrolled and assigned to MucoRice-CTB (10 participants assigned to 1 g, 10 participants assigned to 3 g, and 10 participants assigned to 6 g), or placebo (10 participants assigned to 1 g, 10 participants assigned to 3 g, and 10 participants assigned to 6 g). All participants received at least one dose of study drug or placebo and were included in the safety analyses. Two participants given MucoRice-CTB 3 g and one participant given MucoRice-CTB 6 g were lost to follow-up and excluded from the efficacy analysis. Serum CTB-specific IgG and IgA antibody concentrations in participants who received 6 g MucoRice-CTB increased significantly in both a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner compared with those in the placebo groups (p for interaction = 0.002 for IgG, p = 0.004 for IgA). Genome analysis of subjects' feces before vaccination revealed that compared to non-responders, responders had a gut microbiota of higher diversity with the presence of _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ spp. 28 (93%) of 30 participants who received MucoRice-CTB at any dose had at least one adverse event during the study period, compared with 30 (100%) of 30 participants given placebo. Grade 3 or higher adverse events were reported in 4 participants in the MucoRice-CTB group (5 events) and 4 participants in the placebo group (10 events). The most common serious adverse event was hemoglobin decrease (2 events in 2 participants in the pooled MucoRice-CTB group, 2 events in 2 participants in the placebo group; all grade 3).

"Interpretation: Participants given MucoRice-CTB showed increased CTB-specific serum IgG and IgA antibody concentrations without inducing serious adverse events, indicating that MucoRice-CTB could be a safe and potent vaccine to prevent diarrheal disease. MucoRice-CTB induced neutralizing antibodies against diarrhoeal toxins in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. A similar phase 1 trial will be done with participants of other ethnicities to substantiate our findings." - Mod.LL
