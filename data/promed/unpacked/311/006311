A total of 1009 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) have
been detected in Thailand so far in 2006, the Director-general of the
Disease Control Department said on Saturday [2 Sep 2006]. Doctor
Thawat Sunthajan, the Director-general, said the cases were reported
by public health clinics nationwide between January and the end of
July [2006].
Thawat said 4 children died of the disease and most of the patients
were between 2 and 5 years old.

[The outbreak of HFMD affecting children in Thailand is considerable,
but less extensive than in other parts of southeast Asia, Sarawak in
particular. Enterovirus 71 of genogroup B has been associated
primarily with HFMD in Sarawak; see ProMED-mail post archived as
"Hand, foot & mouth disease - Malaysia (Sarawak)(07) 20060730.2103".
Information on the identity of the virus responsible for HFMD in
Thailand would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
