Bird Migration and West Nile Virus Spread
-----------------------------------------
It is very interesting and enlightening to compare the animated map
of Common Grackle migrations and concentrations at:
<http://www.birdsource.org/GIS/images/cgrack_as96moani.gif>
with the animated map of the spread and distribution of West Nile
Virus in North America from 1999-2002 posted on the Cornell
Laboratory of Ornithology's website:

Influence of Water Abundance on West Nile Virus Spread in the
USA
--------------------------------------------------
I have found the patterns very interesting, because the states with
the most cases generally have the least free or standing water and
have actually had drought or fire danger warnings. That is true for
South Dakota and Colorado for sure. I think we should consider
that extreme dryness and its effect on the occurrence of disease.
Minnesota has a lot of water and many mosquitoes, yet didn't have
the numbers of cases one might expect for our available standing
water conditions. There may be other conditions that explain the
differences, however.
