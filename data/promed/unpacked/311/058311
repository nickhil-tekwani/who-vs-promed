4000 Suspected Chikungunya Cases Detected Nationwide
----------------------------------------------------
The Health Ministry has detected about 4000 suspected chikungunya
cases nationwide this year, Minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai said
Wednesday [17 Dec 2008]. He said the disease which was 1st detected
in Johor had spread to Negeri Sembilan, Melaka, Perak, Selangor and
the latest Kedah.

"So far, the chikungunya [virus] disease is still under control
nationwide," he told reporters after visiting Sultanah Nur Zahirah
Hospital here. Present was Terengganu Health Director Dr Nordiyanah
Hassan.

Liow said that so far, there was no specific medicine to treat the
chikungunya fever disease spread by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. "So, I would
like to call on the public to be careful particularly during the wet
season now because aedes mosquito breeds easily," he said.

To contain the spread of the disease, he said, the ministry had taken
several measures including intensifying the campaign to rid of
_Aedes_ mosquito and holding lectures on the outbreak. He said the
disease was 1st detected to have spread to Malaysia from Africa in
1997.

Meanwhile, he said 63 health projects costing RM458 million [157 313
047 USD] had been approved for implementation in Terengganu under the
9th Malaysia Plan and some had started.

[The number of recorded chikungunya cases has increased from 1703
reported on 4 Sep 2008 by the Ministry of Health to about 4000
reported above, and new cases are occurring (see report below).

This report answers the question posed in earlier posts about
mosquito vector control activities. The chikungunya prevention
activities do include mosquito vector control.
