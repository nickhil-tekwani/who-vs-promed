Last week [week of 21 Nov 2011] new cases of leishmaniasis were
confirmed, so new activities for blocking vector transmission in the
most affected areas are programmed for the next days. As of November
2011, the number of positive diagnoses in the Capital City
[Corrientes] is 122 infected dogs.

According to reports from the Provincial Public Health Ministry and
Health Subsecretariat in Corrientes Municipality, this week,
transmission blocking activities will reach the neighborhoods of
Yapeyu, San Antonio, and San Martin. Some of these places had already
been visited by healthcare personnel, who fumigated the affected areas
and instructed the population with respect to necessary preventive
measures.

It is worth mentioning that the last positive cases reported in the
Capital City were detected in the Yapeyu neighborhood, after being
diagnosed by a private veterinarian who reported the cases to
healthcare authorities.
