The measles epidemic is in decline over a major part of France
--------------------------------------------------------------
More than 22 000 cases of measles have been reported in France since
the beginning of the epidemic in January 2008, according to the latest
figures from the Institute of Health Surveillance [l'Institut de
veille sanitaire (InVS)]. During the first eleven months of 2011, as
many as 15 000 people were affected by the disease. However, the InVS
has identified a major declinee in the number of cases since the
summer, marking the end of the 3rd wave of the measles epidemic.
Among the 15 000 cases observed during the first 11 months of 2011, 16
experienced neurological complications, 649 contracted severe
pneumonia, and 6 French residents died from the disease.

Despite the decline in the number of cases since the summer of 2011,
the InVS cautioned the French population to be vigilant "as a 4th
epidemic wave is very likely with risk of increase in the number of
cases in the coming weeks."

Measles spotted more often in 2011
------------------------------
The number of measles cases in Germany more than doubled in 2011
compared to last year [2010] new figures show, with 1607 people
infected with the virus which can sometimes kill its victims. The
number of infections in 2010 was 780, the public health authority
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) said in Berlin on Friday [30 Dec 2011].

Most of those infected now are older children and young adults, said
RKI president Reinhard Burger, noting that younger children are fairly
well vaccinated. Among children starting school, 96 percent already
have at least one measles vaccination -- but the share of those with
the all-important second jab is lower, at 90 percent.
“This shows that the measles vaccine is not being fundamentally
rejected, rather that the second vaccination is frequently being
forgotten,” said Burger. He said he could not understand why parents
sometimes refuse to get their children inoculated against the disease.
“Measles is not as harmless as some perhaps think. In individual
cases the illness can even kill, or lead to a lasting brain damage,”
he said.

Eastern parts of Germany are better protected not only against measles
but other diseases against which there is a vaccine, he said. But he
added that social status could also affect vaccination rates. A study
conducted by the RKI showed that families with higher social status
tended to vaccinate their children more thoroughly.

Director of the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA), Elisabeth
Pott, said that some social groups were of the opinion that certain
childhood diseases should be allowed to run their course, to
strengthen children’s immune systems -- and thus do not vaccinate
their children.

Germany is following the European trend in a rise of measles cases,
with 14 000 cases reported in 2011 in France alone [15 000 in the
report above]. Information from the World Health Organisation suggests
that more than half the 26 000 cases in Europe affected people older
than 15.

The RKI’s permanent commission on vaccination recommends that not
only children be vaccinated against measles – but also all those
born after 1970 who have not yet been vaccinated, should get it done.

1/3rd of all cases of measles in Russia registered in Dagestan
--------------------------------------------------------------
In the current year [2011], 222 cases of measles in 24 Russian regions
were registered. According to the press service of Dagestan office of
the Russian Federal Consumer Rights Protection and Human Health
Control Service [Rospotrebnadzor], from July till December this year
[2011] 68 laboratory confirmed cases of measles were recorded in 8
administrative districts of Dagestan.

According to the results of epidemiologic investigations, the measles
cases were found mainly among those not vaccinated or those who could
give no information about their vaccination status. "Also, there are
cases of refusal to vaccinate" -- the Office management officials
stated.

Experts of the Rospotrebnadzor Dagestan warned that measles is a
highly contagious and severe infectious disease. After apparent
recovery complications such as blindness, encephalitis, severe
diarrhea and associated dehydration may develop. The are also other
consequences -- including respiratory infections such as bronchitis
and pneumonia. The only effective measure of protection against
measles is immunization. Vaccination against measles is mandatory and
is included in the national immunization schedule of the Russian
Federation.

Long-forgotten disease
----------------------
They say that in our region, people have begun to forget measles.
However, last week 5 adult cases of measles were diagnosed. The
infection was introduced into Chechnya by 2 young men from Dagestan
[see above]. The disease is easily spread by airborne droplets. More
than 500 at-risk people were in contact with these 2 cases. During
the early days of infection the symptoms resemble those of a common
cold, but after a few days body temperature rises to 40 degrees, while
the skin is covered with a rash. For many years this disease had not
been recorded in the adult population, but recently it has become
widespread in Western Europe, and is now appearing among us in the
south [of Russia]. In contrast influenza and SARS have been absent in
the region. During the past week the epidemiological thresholds for
influenza and SARS have been absent in the Voronezh region (Oblast)
