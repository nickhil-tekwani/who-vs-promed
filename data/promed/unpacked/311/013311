Legionnaires' Disease source pinpointed
---------------------------------------
Authorities at Ostfold Hospital Fredrikstad announced Wed, 8 Jun 2005, that
the source of the Legionnaires' disease outbreak that killed 10 and infected
52 so far has been found.
"The hunt for the source of infection is over. We have, to a high degree of
likelihood, found the source," Svein Ronsen said at the press conference. The
Borregard [company] in Sarpsborg has been named as the probable source of the
_Legionella_ bacteria. A purifying installation known as a scrubber, which
cleans air using water, is considered the specific source.
"Such facilities spread large amounts of water vapor through the air,"
communicable disease authorities said at the press conference. The result
came as a surprise to investigating authorities, as such facilities have never
caused a Legionnaires' outbreak before, either in Norway or abroad.

[In order to prove the link, the organisms found in the suggested source and
those from patients need to be shown to be identical. This requires a
diagnosis of legionellosis by culture, not just urinary antigen or serology.
Any device that produces an aqueous aerosol can spread legionellosis. - Mod.LL]
