http://www.hachaklait.org.il/articles/files/3572813011.pdf


In view of the continuing and increasing threat of lumpy skin disease [LSD] to spread during the approaching summer with increased density/activity of blood-sucking arthropods and in order to confer maximal protection to cattle at risk and to reduce the disease's losses, I have decided to order an immediate vaccination of the entire cattle population, all ages.

The following 2 live attenuated vaccines, which have undergone safety tests in the laboratories of the veterinary services and safety trials in the field, are the vaccines prescribed:

1. Sheep pox vaccine (fortified) "POX-10," manufactured by JOVAC.
2. Neethling Lumpy skin vaccine, manufactured by OBP.

All cattle must be vaccinated by 1 May 2013. Later born offspring will be vaccinated in line with the vaccination protocol and according to the instructions of the veterinary services.

[The circular pertains to vaccination protocol and includes a link to the forms required for the reporting of vaccinations when performed by non-governmental practitioners. The forms are available at the web-site of the veterinary services http://tinyurl.com/cx8ncrl. - Mod.AS]

[The circular does not address the payment for vaccination issue. Traditionally, the costs of vaccinations of livestock in Israel -- even when compulsory -- are paid by the animal owners according to State's official fees.

The circular indicates that a significant part of the vaccinations will be performed by non-governmental practitioners. This is a change in the policy prevailing in the country until 2012, when such vaccinations were performed by State Veterinary Services employees.

LSD has been recently reported from Lebanon and the Palestinian authority, and is suspected to be circulating in other Middle Eastern countries. Information on the safety tests/trials performed on the 2 vaccines, and future recordings of their efficacy in Israel, will be useful. - Mod.AS]

[The map in item [2] shows all recorded foci accumulated in Israel since the start of the epizootic in July 2012. Affected beef cattle herds are presented by a green sign, dairy cattle by a pink sign. A concerning feature of this new map is the appearance of a single outbreak in dairy cattle in an area significantly distant from the affected zone in northern Israel, namely some 20-25 km south to Tel Aviv.

Israel's last follow-up report to the OIE on the LSD epizootic was submitted on 4 Feb 2013; at that date, 78 outbreaks had been accumulated. The said report is available at
