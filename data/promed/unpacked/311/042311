Malaria vectors in Liberia
-----------------------------
Virtually nothing has been said about the vectors in Liberia. One of
the world's most efficient malaria vectors is _Anopheles gambiae_, a
species that is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and is the major
vector in Liberia. It breeds in sunlit temporary pools and also larger
collections of water including ricefields.
In coastal Liberia, malaria will also be transmitted by a closely related
species, _An. melas_, which breeds only in saltwater, especially in
mangrove swamps. With _An. gambiae_ the sporozoite rate (the
percentage of females carrying infective malaria stages -- the
sporozoites) is commonly around 5 percent, although a previous survey
in Liberia has recorded sporozoite rates of 8-10 percent, and about 2
percent in the less efficient vector, _An. melas_.
Because the majority of adults of both species bite late at night (
mainly from 2300 - 0400 hrs), mosquito nets can afford good
protection. When nets are impregnated with the insecticide permethrin
or some other pyrethroid, torn nets also become effective in protecting
against malaria. Insecticide-treated nets remain effective for 3-12
months depending on what insecticide is used. They then need to re-
impregnated, which can be done simply by dipping them in an
insecticidal solution. However, the latest development involves
impregnating the fibres used to make nets with permethrin during their
manufacture. Nets made with such insecticide-impregnated fibres give
protection against bites from malaria mosquitoes for up to 4 years.
[Further information about these long-lasting insecticidal nets can be
found on <http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2003/pr71/en/>. -

[From (03) in the refs. below:
"...none slept under insecticide-treated mosquito nets."
It is not clear whether they had no nets, or that the nets were not treated.
If the latter, one wonders why not. Can anyone clarify? - Mod.JW]
