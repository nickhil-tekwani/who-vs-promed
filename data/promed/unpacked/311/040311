A 13-year-old child is a new case of [infection by a] hantavirus in
Maule. Health authorities reported yesterday [24 Jun 2010] that the
child, from the O'Higgins region (Chimbarongo), is being treated in
the Talca Hospital, in Maule region. At first, the child was attended
in the Teno Hospital and later went to the Curico Base Hospital. Due
to the seriousness [of the disease] he was sent to the Talca Hospital,
where he is currently admitted in the UCI [intensive care unit],
connected to a respirator.

According to the epidemiological investigation being carried out by
the Health SEREMI [Regional Ministerial Secretariat], the home of the
youngster was visited, [their report] stating that there are many
conditions of epidemiological risk [there]. The report also states
that the home is in the jurisdiction of the Municipality of
Chimbarongo, in the O'Higgins region. However, due to his serious
condition, he was admitted to the health assistance center in Maule.
Finally, they reported that the child was exposed to places with high
risk factors, and so contracted the disease [virus infection].

To date, there are 7 confirmed hantavirus [infections] in Maule, which
indicates an increase in infections of this disease [virus]. Of these
7 cases, 2 people died.

[Sporadic cases of infection by a hantavirus continue in this region
of central Chile. Although not stated, the hantavirus involved in this
and previous cases doubtless is Andes virus.
