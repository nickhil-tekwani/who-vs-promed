Regional plan for FMD control approved / Middle East outbreaks spread
as far as Libya
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The FAO-designed regional road map was approved by the 38th session
of the FAO European Commission on Foot-and-Mouth Disease [FMD] in
Rome. It is a far-reaching strategy designed to put an end to the
devastating disease in 14 West Asian and Middle East countries most
directly affected.

"We have agreed a plan that links the different authorities and
agencies involved in controlling this disease, the aim being to free
this group of countries of FMD by 2020," said Keith Sumption,
Secretary of the FAO-based EuFMD Commission.

In the 1st 2 months of 2009 more than 130 cases of type A FMD
outbreaks were recorded in central and southern Iraq and cases of the
same strain were also discovered in Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon and as
far afield as Libya, FAO said.

There is concern the disease could spread to neighbouring FMD-free
zones in the Mediterranean area. FMD is a highly contagious disease
affecting cloven-hoofed animals, including domestic animals such as
cattle, sheep and pigs and although it is rarely transmitted to
humans an outbreak can increase the price of protein for poor people
and wreak havoc on farmers' incomes.

Type A is particularly dangerous because it is difficult to keep
emergency stocks of suitable vaccines as the strain evolves and
mutates rapidly. "Type A FMD is already considered endemic in Turkey,
Iran and Pakistan" said Sumption. "The fact it is now showing up
elsewhere indicates that it is increasing in these countries as well
as being on the move in the region, even making its way as far as Libya."

Several agencies and donors, including the FAO, the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the European Commission (EC)
and the Asian Development Bank, support programmes in Eastern Europe,
West and Central Asia and the Middle East aimed at controlling FMD.
In addition, most governments in this region invest heavily in FMD
control programmes, and receive technical assistance from FAO. The
roadmap will help to improve early warning, prevention and outbreak
control measures, as well as boost the presence and accessibility of
European expertise and technical know-how. It will be carried out
under the umbrella of the OIE/FAO Global Framework for the
Progressive Control of Trans-boundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADS).

In Iraq, where conflict has devastated veterinary services, FAO is
implementing an USD 8.8 million programme to restore animal health
services and a separate USD 2.4 million programme to strengthen the
capacity of the Iraqi veterinary services for the control of
trans-boundary animal diseases. It has a similar USD 5 million
programme in Pakistan to control contagious animal diseases in
Central Asia. In the Trans-Caucasus, Iran and Syria, FAO is
implementing support to FMD control under an Euro 8 million agreement
with the EC to implement EuFMD Commission actions.

Meat imports into many countries of the Middle and Near East are
expanding due to growing demand from large sections of the
population, increasing the probability of trans-boundary infection.
Decisive investments in surveillance, detection and control of this
dangerous disease are therefore regarded generally as particularly
well justified.

The FAO European Commission on FMD met in Rome from 28-30 Apr 2009.
