The alarming increase in the number of coronavirus-related fatalities in Brazil continued on Friday [12 Jun 2020] as the South American nation recorded around 909 deaths in the last 24 hours alone. Brazil's total death toll now stands at 41 828, and it has surpassed Britain to become the 2nd worst-affected country by COVID-19 in the world after the USA.

According to official reports, the sharp increase in virus-related cases and deaths in Brazil will continue for now while the experts suggest the actual number of coronavirus cases in the country might be 10 or 15 times higher than the existing number. Brazil, the largest country in South America, is not far away from touching one million coronavirus cases, as the number currently stands at 828 810. The only country to hit one million infections is the USA.

It should be noted that Brazil reported its 1st COVID-19 case some 3.5 months ago, and the coronavirus situation is still far from being controlled in the country. Despite the rampant spike in cases and deaths, Brazil administration has reopened activities in major cities like Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo to boost the economy.

Sao Paulo state, with 46 million people, is by far the hardest-hit in Brazil with 10 368 deaths -- about a quarter of the country's total -- and 167 900 infections. Rio de Janeiro has seen 7417 deaths and nearly 78 000 cases of coronavirus so far.

In terms of coronavirus cases, the USA leads the global charts with a staggering number of 2.04 million infections. Brazil comes at 2nd with 828 810 cases, while Russia follows next with 510 761 cases. India stands at the 4th spot with 297 535 cases, while Britain completes the top 5 with 294 402 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

[The Ministry of Health maintains statistics on the "novo coronavirus" (SARS-CoV-2) at https://covid.saude.gov.br/. There are excellent statistics on the geographic breakdown of cases and cumulative population-based rates: In terms of absolute numbers, Sao Paulo state has the highest number of cases followed by the states of Ceara, Para, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Paraiba, Maranhao, Amapa, Bahia, and Espirito Santo with the 10th highest number of cases. Sao Paulo is the hardest hit state in terms of absolute numbers, and it has a population-based rate of 365.6 per 100 000 population and a population-based mortality rate is 22.6 per 100 000 population. However, the state with the highest population-based rate is Amapa, in the north of the country with a rate of 1854.4 per 100 000 population. Amapa is bordered by French Guiana to its north, the Atlantic Ocean to its east, Para state to its south and west and Suriname to its northwest. The other states with population-based rates higher than 1000 per 100 000 population (i.e.; 1%) are also in the North Region, including Amazonas, Roraima, and Acre.

Summary
------
Background: Assessing the burden of COVID-19 on the basis of medically attended case numbers is suboptimal given its reliance on testing strategy, changing case definitions, and disease presentation. Population-based serosurveys measuring anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (anti-SARS-CoV-2) antibodies provide one method for estimating infection rates and monitoring the progression of the epidemic. Here, we estimate weekly seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the population of Geneva, Switzerland, during the epidemic.

Methods: The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Sante study [an annual health examination survey of a representative sample of the population of the canton] and their household members. We planned a series of 12 consecutive weekly serosurveys among randomly selected participants from a previous population-representative survey, and their household members aged 5 years and older. We tested each participant for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA. We estimated seroprevalence using a Bayesian logistic regression model taking into account test performance and adjusting for the age and sex of Geneva's population. Here we present results from the first 5 weeks of the study.

Findings: Between 6 Apr 2020 and 9 May 2020, we enrolled 2766 participants from 1339 households, with a demographic distribution similar to that of the canton of Geneva. In the 1st week, we estimated a seroprevalence of 4.8% (95% CI, 2.4-8.0; n = 341). The estimate increased to 8.5% (5.9-11.4; n = 469) in the 2nd week, 10.9% (7.9-14.4; n = 577) in the 3rd week, 6.6% (4.3-9.4; n = 604) in the 4th week, and 10.8% (8.2-13.9; n = 775) in the 5th week. Individuals aged 5-9 years (relative risk [RR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.11-0.63]) and those older than 65 years (RR, 0.50 [0.28-0.78]) had a significantly lower risk of being seropositive than those aged 20-49 years. After accounting for the time to seroconversion, we estimated that for every reported confirmed case, there were 11.6 infections in the community.

Interpretation: These results suggest that most of the population of Geneva remained uninfected during this wave of the pandemic, despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in the region (5000 reported clinical cases over less than 2.5 months in the population of half a million people). Assuming that the presence of IgG antibodies is associated with immunity, these results highlight that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of fewer susceptible people in the population. Further, a significantly lower seroprevalence was observed for children aged 5-9 years and adults older than 65 years, compared with those aged 10-64 years. These results will inform countries considering the easing of restrictions aimed at curbing transmission.

[It is interesting to see that the estimated uncaptured rate of the surveillance system is 11.6 -- so for each reported case there are 11.6 additional infected individuals -- in keeping with the estimated range of 10 to 20 uncaptured infections per reported case. The survey population is described as: "The SEROCoV-POP study is a population-based study of former participants of the Bus Sante study and their household members. The Bus Sante study is a yearly representative stratified sample of 500 men and 500 women from the general population of the canton of Geneva. Eligible individuals were aged 20-74 years, identified through an annual residential list established by the local government." -- providing somewhat more validity to the results as representative of the population of the Canton of Geneva. Interestingly, there was only one positive child in the 5- to 9-year-old age-group, in a household where there was a positive adult case, consistent with the observation of children being less affected. The authors mentioned that there was household clustering, but there were 21 (17.1%) that had at least one positive household member. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 55.2% of the global newly reported cases and 69.1% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Brazil reported 43.7% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, the USA reported 27.0%, Chile 7.4%, Peru 6.8%, and Mexico 6.5%.

The European region reported 14.5% of the global newly reported cases and 11.5% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 45.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by Sweden 7.4%, the UK 6.4%, Turkey 5.0%, Belarus 3.8%, and Ukraine 3.4%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 14.1% of the global newly reported cases and 7.4% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 31.0% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia 19.3%, Iran 11.6%, Qatar 7.6%, Egypt 7.5%, and Iraq 6.5%.

The African region reported 4.2% of the global newly reported cases and 2.2% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 55.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria 12.0%, Cote d'Ivoire 3.9%, Gabon 3.0%, Ethiopia 2.9%, Ghana 2.8%, and Central African Republic 2.7%.

The Western Pacific region reported 0.74% of the global newly reported cases and 0.24% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 57.3% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore 34.9%, South Korea 3.5%, and Japan 3.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 11.5% of the global newly reported cases and 8.0% of global fatalities. India reported 67.8% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 21.6%, Indonesia 8.4%, and Nepal 1.9%.

Impression: Europe seems to be stabilizing at a significantly lower rate, although Russia is still reporting 8000+ new cases a day. The Eastern Mediterranean is approximately at parity with the European region with Pakistan reporting 5000+ cases a day. South East Asia is approaching parity with the European and Eastern Mediterranean regions with India reporting 8000-10 000+ cases a day. The Americas region is reporting over 70 000 cases a day with Brazil reporting 25 000-30 000+ cases a day, and the USA seems to have stabilized at 20 000+ a day. In the Africa region, the regional proportion is slowly climbing with South Africa reporting in the 2000-3000+ range daily, and in the Western Pacific region they are maintaining a very low rate compared with the other regions, with Singapore and the Philippines averaging 400+ cases per day (Singapore had been reporting twice as many cases per day for a period of time but has dropped back over the past couple of weeks).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 12 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas region continues to increase, as does South East Asia, which is approaching parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases, and the Eastern Mediterranean, which has surpassed the European region, and the African region is noticeably increasing as well. The Americas region continues to greatly outnumber all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]

[*On 2 Jun 2020, France completed a review of all positive lab tests reported and removed all duplicate tests on individuals who were counted more than once. This led to a decrease in cumulative case counts.
In the table above, NA is "not applicable"; those countries whose 1st case was reported after 1 Mar 2020 did not have cases on 1 Mar 2020. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 7 732 485, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count increased by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA, with more than 2.11 million confirmed cases, now represents 27.4% of the global cases of COVID-19, as other countries such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Mexico, India, and Pakistan are increasing their numbers of cumulative cases significantly. A global total of 428 236 deaths have been reported, an increase of 4392 deaths in the past 24 hours. A reminder that in the absence of well-developed contact tracing activities with testing of asymptomatic and mildly ill contacts, there is major underreporting of numbers of infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, possibly 1/10th to 1/20th in order of magnitude. There are also individuals who stay at home throughout their illness, sometimes unfortunately dying at home and are never officially confirmed as infected with the SARS-CoV-2. These data are presented to provide relative indicators of the situations in each of the countries and comparisons between countries and regions of the world.

In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19, followed by Brazil, Russia, India, the UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Germany, and Iran at number 10. China is number 18. This ordering has not changed in the past 24 hours. In descending rank order, the USA is number 1 for number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, Russia, Chile, Peru, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, and South Africa -- Pakistan did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours, so South Africa joined the top 10 list for number of newly confirmed cases.

The top 20 countries in terms of absolute cumulative cases, which include 7 from the European region, 6 from the Americas region, 4 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the Western Pacific region -- unchanged in the past 96 hours. There are no countries from the Africa region. The top 20 countries with most newly confirmed cases include 8 from the Americas region, 5 from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the European region, 2 from the South-East Asia region, and 1 from the African region -- none from the Western Pacific region. There was 1 additional country from the European region (Turkey) and 1 fewer country from the Eastern Mediterranean region (Pakistan). This listing very much reflects the "hot spots" in terms of countries with ongoing high transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.MPP]
