The rate of tick-borne encephalitis is lower this year [2013] in comparison with last year. Summer is the peak season for ticks. There are still some lethal and serious cases of tick-borne encephalitis occurring due to the fact that people bitten by ticks have not been vaccinated. The senior epidemiologist in Zabaykalye, Anna Vasilyeva stated that 23 districts of Chita city are endemic zones for tick-borne encephalitis. The highest rate is observed in the Krasnochikoisky, Petrovsk-Zabaykalye, Khiloksky, Uletovsky, Baleysky, Karymsky, Shelopuginsky, Tungokochensky, Olovianinsky districts, and Chita city. Last year [2012] there were 57 cases of tick-borne encephalitis, 3 with lethal outcomes.

During the same epidemic period last year (March-November 2012) 5638 people applied for tick-bite treatment and 13.8 per cent were found to be tick-borne encephalitis [virus] carriers. During the same period this year there were 2360 people who were identified as tick-borne encephalitis carriers as of 25 Jun 2013. 24 people among those carriers were hospitalized with suspected tick-borne encephalitis, and 7 were confirmed. (Last year [2012] 25 cases were suspected and 6 were confirmed).

[Tick-borne encephalitis is now a vaccine preventable disease. It is caused by closely related but distinct flaviviruses. 3 subtypes are recognised by the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy: a far-eastern subtype, a Siberian subtype, and a European subtype. The Siberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_ (see image at http://www.planktonik.com/museum/images/insects/0205dani01.jpg), whereas the European subtype causes central European encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (see image at http://www.biopix.com/photos/ixodes-ricinus-00078.jpg). The former causes the more serious disease, with mortality that can reach 25 per cent, whereas mortality in the case of the latter seldom reaches 5 per cent. Effective vaccines are now available against each subtype.

The location of Zabaykalye krai in the south-eastern region of Russia can be seen on the map at http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/russiaaddivisions.jpg. The city of Chita is located in the Eastern Siberian region of Zabaykalye. Zabaykalye literally means "beyond the Baikal' (Lake Baikal). This territory lies 4000 miles [6437 km] east of Moscow. It is much closer to China, North Korea, and Mongolia -- with which it shares borders -- than to European Russia. - Mod.CP]
