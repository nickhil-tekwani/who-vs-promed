[1] Cholera - Nigeria (Adamawa)

A cholera outbreak has claimed 39 lives in northern Nigeria's Adamawa
state in the past week, a senior local official said on Tuesday [18 Aug 2009].

"An outbreak of cholera in our locality in the last week has killed a
family, including a 52-year-old man, his wife and child. 36 other
people have also died," the deputy chairman of Maiha local
government, Yahaya Hamman-Julde, told reporters.

He said "scores of people" had been hospitalized as a result of the
disease, adding that an ongoing strike by medical workers in the
state was hampering efforts to assist the sick. Julde could not
immediately disclose the cause of the disease, but recalled that a
similar outbreak in June 2009 killed 20 people in the area.

Last September 2008, a spate of cholera outbreaks in northern Nigeria
claimed almost 100 lives in 3 states, Katsina, Zamfara and Bauchi.

[2] Cholera - Congo DR (Notth Kivu)
Date: Tue 18 Aug 2009

87 cases of acute diarrhea have been reported in less than 2 weeks.
According to the provincial medical inspector, it is cholera,
although laboratory results have not yet confirmed that. The only
good news at the moment is that there have not been any deaths
reported, said radiookapi.net.

At the Provincial hospital, visited this Tuesday [18 Aug 2009]
morning, there were 25 patients hospitalized [with cholera].
According to the provincial medical inspector, this situation is due
to the lack of running water in the city of Goma. Until now, many
households directly consume water taken from the lake. The director
of nursing at this hospital says the hospital has treated over 10 new
patients since the weekend.

"Since Saturday [15 Aug 2009], there have already been more than 40
cases; on Sunday [16 Aug 2009], 12 cases [were seen]; yesterday [17
Aug 2009], there were 18 cases seen, and now we are left with 25
cases. Last week, there were 2 or 3 cases per day. You see, since
Saturday, the number of cases per day has exceeded 10; it's too many.

[3] Cholera - Ethiopia (Oromia)
Date: Sat 8 Aug 2009

According to information obtained from Oromia, AWD (Acute Watery
Diarrhea, commonly known as cholera) is ravaging West Arsi, East
Shewa, West Hararghe, North Shewa and Arsi zones in the state of
Oromia. Unfortunately, the government's lack of attention to the
control, treatment and intervention of the situation is exacerbating
the problem.

Cholera is expanding and killing hundreds of people in West Arsi
(Shashamane, Kofale, Shalla, Arsi Negele and other districts), East
Shewa (Fantale, Boset and Adami Tulu districts), West Hararghe
(Mieso, Guba Qoricha, Chiro and other neighboring districts) and
North Shewa (Wara Jarso district), and Arsi zones (Merti, Jaju, and
other neighboring districts).

According to experts and informants, on 29 Jul 2009, there were over
1700 cases of cholera and 28 deaths in the West Arsi zone. Out of 220
cases, 5 deaths are reported in Mieso, Chiro and Guba Qoricha
districts. Similar death cases are also reported from all other
affected districts and zones.

Due to lack of access to the remote areas of the zones, the number of
death cases and cholera-affected people has been under-reported; the
problem is much worse than what is being reported. The situation in
West Arsi is the worst; the government has prohibited visits to the area.

[4] Cholera - Somalia
Date: Wed Aug 12 2009
From: Grainne Moloney <grainne.moloney@fsnau.org>


Cholera is endemic in Somalia, and in 2009, the outbreak is
particularly bad. However, we are not reporting directly in this
update on Mogadishu, given our lack of access, and, in addition, our
target population for assessments are children less than 5 years old.
We are not involved in any assessment of the peace keepers, and I do
not have access to any information on the outbreak affecting them.

[6] Cholera, prison - Zimbabwe (Masvingo)

Six inmates at Masvingo Remand Prison have succumbed to cholera as a
fresh outbreak has been reported, despite claims by the government
that it has contained the disease. Prison officials told Radio VOP on
Monday [3 Aug 2009] that the fresh outbreak had added woes at the
prison, battling to contain hunger-related diseases that have claimed
over 100 lives in all Masvingo's 3 prison centers.

"Six of our inmates at the Remand prison lost their lives after they
contracted cholera last week. We did not anticipate another outbreak
this year [2009] after we had successfully contained the previous
outbreak in 2008," said Zimbabwe Prison Service provincial officer,
Edmore Chatikobo.

He said they were hurriedly taken to Masvingo general hospital but
could not get medical attention due to drug shortages, and only 4
were treated, leading to the deaths of the other 6.

Masvingo Provincial Medical Director, Dr Robert Madyiradima,
confirmed the outbreak. "We received reports about the outbreak, and
I am sure about 10 inmates from the prison were brought to our
hospital for treatment, and we could not attend all due to shortages
of drugs, and this led to the death of others," he said.

[7] Cholera - Nepal

The Ministry of Health has put the latest death toll due to the
diarrhea-cholera epidemic at 301, including 151 in Jajarkot.

Organizing a press conference on Sunday [16 Aug 2009], senior health
administrator at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division Dr
Bishwa Raj Khanal said 46 diarrhea deaths have been confirmed in
Rukum, 20 in Dailekh, 17 in Achham, 14 in Surkhet, 8 each in Baitadi
and Doti, 7 in Dolpa, 6 each in Salyan and Bajhang, 4 each in Rolpa,
Dadeldhura and Kailali, 3 in Bajura, 2 in Pyuthan and one in Kanchanpur.

Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, who returned to the capital recently after
serving in Jajarkot for around a month, shared his experience while
working in the district and blamed lack of awareness and sanitation
and difficult terrain for the severity of the outbreak.

Talking about the death tolls, Chand admitted that there are bound to
be differences in numbers because no one has a foolproof mechanism to
verify the cause of deaths, and they have to rely on the accounts of
villagers. "We don't entertain any deaths as caused by cholera on
mere insistence of villagers, who generally say that the deceased
also had a bout of diarrhea," Chand explained.

A 50-year-old resident of Maharaaj Nagar was tested positive for
cholera this morning [14 Aug 2009]. He had been admitted to a
hospital at Gurdev Nagar yesterday, 13 Aug 2009. With this case, the
confirmed cholera cases have gone up to 18. The district health
officer, Dr SS Dhir, said the previous cases had been reported from
private hospitals in various localities.

Two out of the 3 persons who died recently at Sunet village near BRS
Nagar had cholera. Expressing concern that the cholera patient lived
among 22 families living in a "vehra" at Maharaaj Nagar, he said a
team of health officials would collect water samples and assess the situation.

Dr GS Garewal, medical director of the hospital where the patient was
admitted, said: "Consumption of contaminated water is the apparent
cause of infection. He has been kept in isolation. He was in a
critical condition yesterday [13 Aug 2009], but is stable now."

[9] Diarrhea, Dysentery - Honduras
Date: Tue 18 Aug 2009

<http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=30903>


The health authorities reported yesterday [17 Aug 2009] that the
numbers of reported cases of diarrhea and dysentery during the
current year [2009] have reached more than 150 000, an increase of 20
percent compared over the number of cases reported in 2008, which
also represents infant mortality.

"We expect that approximately 3000 children will die from different
causes during the year, and one of them is diarrhea, followed by
pneumonia and congenital malformations, and this should be given
special attention and not direct activities only towards [influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009]," Pinel said.

According to the [ministry] official, the increase in [reported cases
of] diarrhea is related to [the fact that] programs against this
disease do not have adequate funds to meet the established targets
for reduction of child mortality, but it is something that needs to
be readdressed immediately.
