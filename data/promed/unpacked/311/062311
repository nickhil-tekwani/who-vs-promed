The government is to set up a wide-ranging public inquiry into the
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) crisis, the environment minister, Michael
Meacher, said. It will investigate the reasons for the outbreak and look at
a major shake-up in farming with more organic locally-produced meat and
crops. Public inquiries were set up after the 1967 FMD outbreak and in 1952.
Mr Meacher, head of the government's rural task force, said:
"Unquestionably, there will be [a public inquiry this time, to ascertain
the cause and how it happened, and the way we can prevent it happening
again. We will want to know how the disease got such a hold and the levels
of animal transport across the country."
The regions worst affected by foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)are those already
most exposed to economic setbacks. The vulnerability of Cumbria,
Northumberland, and Devon is worsened by their rural economy being heavily
dependent on the "duo-poly" of agriculture and tourism, according to the
Countryside Agency (CA), the government's statutory adviser on rural issues.
The future of farming, with more emphasis on organic production, small
abattoirs, and local production methods, would come under the spotlight. Mr
Meacher said although farming in the UK accounted for only 1 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP), farmers were responsible for caring for 70-80
percent of the landscape.
Before the disease outbreak, the CA detected pessimistic attitudes among
livestock farmers, with 12 percent saying they intended to leave an
industry they believed had no future - double last year's figure. The CA
found farming incomes averaged just GBP 7800 ($12 000) last year - the
lowest level for a quarter of a century.
Mr. Meacher added that a longer-term view was needed "about what we mean
about sustainability in agriculture. I think we have to accelerate this
shift away from what is subsidized agriculture to agri-environment, on a
much larger scale and roll out many of the measures that are in the rural
white paper. We need a fundamental re-think of what we expect farming to
produce. It will certainly be more localized, it will be less
internationalized, less dependent on chemicals and fertilizers, it will be
more low-impact agriculture, more organic. We are at the outset of what has
to be a widescale public debate."
But he also identified the need for farmers to adjust their attitudes to
changing situations. He said, "I think farmers may have to look at the sort
of services they can provide as land managers which is beyond growing food.
It could be renewable energy, it could be flood control measures, it could
be habitat creation and we need to create more mechanisms to enable society
to pay them to do that."
