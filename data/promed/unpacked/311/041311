Southern China may have been the source for much of the spread of the
H5N1 avian flu virus, researchers suggested on Tuesday [18 Mar 2008].

A genetic analysis of the virus shows that strains that showed up in
Viet Nam, Thailand and Malaysia in 2002 and 2003 closely resemble a
strain from poultry markets in China's Yunnan Province, the flu
experts found. Two viruses found in poultry in China's Hunan province
in 2002 and 2003 were most closely related to viruses from Indonesia,
they reported in the Journal of Virology. "These results suggest a
direct transmission link for H5N1 viruses between Yunnan and Viet Nam
and also between Hunan and Indonesia during 2002 and 2003," wrote the
researchers, who included Guan Yi of the University of Hong Kong and
Robert Webster of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis,
Tennessee. "Poultry trade may be responsible for virus introduction
to Viet Nam, while the transmission route from Hunan to Indonesia
remains unclear," they wrote.

The H5N1 bird flu virus was 1st seen in a goose in southern China's
Guangdong province in 1996. A 1997 outbreak in Hong Kong killed 6
people. The virus reemerged in 2003 when 2 members of a Hong Kong
family who had recently visited Fujian province became ill, and one
died. [See ProMED archive Influenza, human, H5N1 - China (Hong Kong)
(11) 19971208.2449. - Mod.JW]

Since 2003, H5N1 bird flu has been found in more than 60 countries
and territories. It has killed 236 people out of 373 infected in 14
countries: Myanmar, Turkey, Djibouti, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Pakistan,
Iraq, Indonesia, Thailand, Viet Nam, China, Nigeria, Laos and
Cambodia.

Yi and Webster's team wanted to find out whether H5N1 viruses all
descend from one type. "Due to the lack of influenza surveillance
prior to these outbreaks, the genetic diversity and the transmission
pathways of H5N1 viruses from this period remain undefined," they
wrote.

In 2007, a team at the University of California Irvine reported that
Guangdong appeared to be the source of renewed waves of the H5N1
strain. Chinese officials denied the report at the time.

[There have been many reports on the undocumented and illegal
movements of poultry between regions and countries, so this is
probably a sound working hypothesis.

There are total of 80 reports in this thread in the ProMED-mail
archive. - Mod.MHJ]
