Further to our first posting on 29 August 1997 in which we reported two
fatal cases of acute viral encephalomyelitis due to enterovirus 71, we now
report on two additional cases seen in the University Hospital, Kuala
Lumpur.
Case 3: WYG, a 15 month-old Chinese boy, was unwell for 5 days before
admission. He developed high fever and red spots on the palms and soles.
He had cough with poor feeding and was seen by a pediatrician who made a
diagnosis of viral fever. When his condition deteriorated, he was taken to
the Emergency Unit of the University Hospital and was found to be
tachypnoeic, sweaty, cyanosed with very poor peripheral perfusion. He was
still alert and responding to his mother appropriately. A chest x-ray
showed diffuse pulmonary oedema. Upon intubation, copious amounts of pink
frothy secretions were obtained. He developed bradycardia and despite
intervention, died two and a half hours after admission.
Case 4: KR, a 4 year-old Indian girl, had a 3 day history of fever and
vomiting with associated lower limbs weakness for 2 days. When seen at the
University Hospital, she was alert, fully conscious with mild neck
stiffness. There was paresis of the lower limbs with absent reflexes and
down-going plantar. Sensation was intact. There was transient
hypertension and her clinical condition deteriorated rapidly while in the
ward with the development of tachypnoea and tachycardia. The patient was
intubated and copious amounts of pink frothy secretion were obtained. She
developed cardiorespiratory arrest and died one hour later despite active
resuscitation.
Laboratory investigation: Post mortem was conducted and the pathology
findings in both cases were similar to the first two cases reported
earlier. In Case 3, the sections of the cerebrum did not show any
significant changes. However, the section of the medulla, pons and
midbrain showed extensive peri-vascular cuffing of lymphocytes around most
of the blood vessels, occasional sites of neuronal early degeneration with
microglial reaction, and acute inflammatory cell reaction. The heart
muscle was normal. In Case 4, sections of the medulla and cervical spinal
cord showed widespread inflammation with perivascular lymphocytic
infiltrates, microglial nodule reaction, extensive neuronal necrosis,
myelin depletion and gliosis. The cerebrum did not show any inflammation
and the myocardium showed no myocarditis. The lungs showed extensive
oedema with reticulated strands of fibrin within the alveoli. According to
the pathology reports, the cause of death in both cases was brain stem
encephalitis.
Enterovirus 71 was isolated in Vero cells from the medulla, cervical spinal
cord and throat swabs in both cases five days post-inoculation.
[Thanks to Ken Lam for this up-date. What was the case-fatality rate in
this epidemic? Would Ken, Mark Pallansch, or another expert care to
comment on whether this was an unusual experience with this virus or simply
an outbreak of a well-recognized human pathogen? -- Mod CHC
