Bulgaria has reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu virus on a farm in the northeastern district of Dobrich, the national food safety agency said on [Mon 5 Feb 2018].

The virus, found on a farm in the town of General Toshevo, located near the border with Romania, would lead to the death of 140 000 birds, the agency said.

"A 3-kilometer [2-mile] protection zone and a 10-km [6-mi] observation area around the livestock area were set up," the agency said in a statement, adding that a ban on the trade and movement of domestic, wild and other birds and trade in eggs, had been imposed.

The Balkan country has also registered 4 cases of bird flu since October [see comment below].

The virulence of highly pathogenic bird flu viruses has prompted countries such as Saudi Arabia to bar poultry imports from Bulgaria.

[On 26 Feb 2018, Bulgaria submitted to the OIE a follow-up (final) report (no 3) notifying an outbreak of HPAI H5N8 which had started on 20 Nov 2017 on a poultry farm in central Bulgaria (Gita, Stara Zagora), causing 19 deaths out of the 2981 susceptible birds. This outbreak was, similarly to the previous 4 outbreaks during this Bulgarian H5N8 event which started on 17 Oct 2017, addressed by the application of stamping out policy as required by EC legislation. It became the last and final outbreak in the event which was declared "resolved" as of 31 Dec 2017 (see summary, a map, and links to all relevant reports, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=25082).

The current outbreak is thus a new event, expected to be reported in an immediate notification to the OIE. - Mod.AS
