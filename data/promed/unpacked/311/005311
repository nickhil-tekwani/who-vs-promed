The Ministry of Health would like to state that the autopsy report on
2 of the dead monkeys found recently in the forest, were positive for
the yellow fever virus. The autopsy was conducted by CAREC (Caribbean
Epidemiology Centre) / PAHO (Pan American Health Organization). It
should be noted that in 1988, 1999, and again in 1995 the yellow
fever virus was found in monkeys. However there were no associated
human cases of the yellow fever virus.

Humans are completely protected from the virus once they are immunized.

As a reminder though, the Ministry of Health would like to advise
persons living around or entering the forests that they MUST ensure
that their immunization status is up to date.

The following precautionary measures should also be followed:
- wear long and protective clothing;
- apply insect repellent;
- use mosquito nets

The Ministry of Health has also intensified its public health
education program and its immunization program in communities close
to forested areas and throughout the country

Additional flyers, loudspeaker announcements, and the Clinomobile
Units are being used to sensitize these communities on the yellow
fever virus and on immunization in general.

The population is reminded to check their immunization cards in order
to ensure that they are up to date. Immunization coverage can last up
to 10 years from the date of immunization. Persons, who are not up to
date, can go to their nearest local health centre for boosters.

Although there have been no human cases of yellow fever in Trinidad
and Tobago since 1979, cases have occurred in Brazil and other Latin
American countries over the past 2 years.

The Ministry of Health would like to assure the public that there is
an adequate supply of yellow fever vaccines in stock and additional
doses are expected in the first quarter of this year.

[ProMED-mail thanks Naomi Bryant for sending in this report
confirming that the red howler monkeys in Trinidad were, in fact,
dying of yellow fever virus infection. The Ministry of Health there
is wisely taking a proactive response to these findings.
