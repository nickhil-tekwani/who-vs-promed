The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS), in collaboration with the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) and local health departments, is working to investigate cases of _Salmonella_ infection associated with shelled peas sold at Wisconsin farmers markets. The investigation shows that at least 6 people were infected with the same strain of the _Salmonella_ bacterium after purchasing shelled peas produced by Green Barn Farm Market of Ripon, Wisconsin. The peas were sold at Green Barn Farm Market farm stands and farmers markets in Ripon, Green Bay, Madison, and Fond du Lac, as well as Green Valley Acres Farm and Company farm stand in Neenah. Shelled peas are loose, no longer in their pod.

Anyone who purchased shelled (loose) peas from Green Barn Farm Market or Green Valley Acres Farm since 1 Jul 2022 is advised to not eat them and to throw them away, even if the peas have been frozen. If you ate any shelled (loose) peas purchased from Green Barn Farm Market or Green Valley Acres Farm since 1 Jul 2022 and are experiencing symptoms of salmonellosis, contact a doctor right away. Let them know you may have been in contact with _Salmonella_. Signs and symptoms of _Salmonella_ infection include diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting that lasts for several days.

This investigation is ongoing.

[It is unclear at this point at which point the peas were contaminated, in the field or during the process of removing the peas from the shells. While in the shells, they would seem protected; in some produce with irrigation contamination, enteric bacteria such as _Salmonella_ or _E. coli_ can enter the plant and potentially be transmissible. This type of contamination has been described with leafy vegetables such as lettuce or spinach, but it is unclear whether it could occur in peas. - Mod.LL
