The possible person-to-person transmission of a hantavirus, in this case most probably of Andes virus (ANDV), remains fascinating and perplexing. However, the occurrence of clusters of (even seroconfirmed) ANDV human infection should always be scrutinized with the necessary circumspection. I remember the story of one of the Swedish founding fathers of hantavirology, Bo Niklasson, describing the fate of 4 friends who likewise shared a rural cabin for one night, only to find thereafter they were all 4 acutely infected with Puumala virus (PUUV). The hypothesis was that this same cabin had also been shared by a "super-shedder" of the PUUV rodent reservoir, _Myodes glareolus_.

The PCR confirmation in an index case, and serum molecular analysis of all subsequent involved cases, remains a conditio sine qua non for claiming yet another person-to-person transmission of ANDV, as was done for an ANDV Epilink/96 variant in El Bolson, Rio Negro province, in 1996.

[As the epidemiological studies of this unusual outbreak are reported, one hopes that the specific circumstances under which transmission occurred will become available, as will molecular analyses of the Andes viruses involved in these cases. Dr. Clement is thanked for his insightful comments. - Mod.TY
