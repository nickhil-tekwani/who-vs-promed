French BSE crisis worsens
-------------------------
Fears over the safety of French beef rose again this weekend after the
country's most senior scientific adviser on BSE confirmed that large
amounts of infected meat were still likely to be entering the human food
chain, putting anyone eating beef at risk of developing variant CJD.
Professor Jeanne Brug-Picoux, an adviser to the French government on BSE
and related diseases, said most of the country's farmers and meat
inspectors were incapable of recognising even the most obvious symptoms of
the disease. "Of course there is infected meat being passed for human
consumption," Brug-Picoux said. "It is there either because of fraud or
because our meat inspectors cannot diagnose BSE in its early stages."
Brug-Picoux's comments were followed by a warning from France's meat
inspectors that they planned to strike over the lack of training, equipment
and manpower to monitor BSE.
Last year Britain imported 4800 tons of beef from France. Its Food
Standards Agency (FSA) insisted this weekend, however, that there is little
Britain can do because under European Union regulations introduced on
October 1, no member state can unilaterally block imports from another,
whatever the risk is thought to be. France has illegally refused to lift
its ban on British beef, despite the EU's insistence it must."We cannot
stop beef imports from France without breaking the law," an FSA spokesman
said. "Action has to come from Brussels."
The mounting crisis over French beef is reverberating around Europe. Italy
has threatened a total ban unless there is an urgent meeting of the EU
veterinary committee to discuss the situation. Hungary and Poland have
banned French beef and Germany is threatening to do so. Spain has banned
the import of French cattle for breeding.
Beef sales within France have declined by 60% over the past week as public
confidence in the meat has collapsed.
88 French cases of BSE have come to light this year, compared with 80
between 1988, when the disease was first reported, and 1999.
This total is far smaller than the 2000-plus cases expected in Britain this
year, but 2 factors make the French situation more unpredictable and
dangerous. The number of infected animals in France is unknown but it is
likely to be many thousands since most of the country's herds were exposed
to infected feed, which is the most likely source of the disease. In
addition, France has no limit on the age at which cows can enter the food
chain, even though experiments have shown that animals with BSE become
highly infectious over the age of 30 months.

France acts on BSE
------------------
Sales of beef have dropped recently French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has
announced a ban on T-bone steaks and a moratorium on the use of animal
products in livestock feed. The measures are intended to calm public fears
in France over the rising cases of BSE, or mad cow disease. Other measures
announced by Mr Jospin include: random tests on cattle entering
slaughterhouses; more funds for research into BSE.
French restrictions in force since 1990 ban the use of meat and bone meal
in cattle feed, but the new temporary ban will apply to all livestock
fodder. The new ban has been prompted by fears that feeds containing cattle
products have been accidentally or deliberately fed to cattle, despite the
existing ban. The ban on T-bone steaks is intended to eliminate from the
food chain the vertebrae of cattle. Butchers will also be ordered to
provide a new cut of cote de boeuf, a traditional French dish.
Last week Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany rejected a proposal by farmers
to slaughter of millions of cattle in an attempt to wipe out the disease.
Mr Glavany said it would be too costly and would only create more
"psychosis" among consumers.

Paris bans beef on the bone to calm consumers
---------------------------------------------
Three more BSE cases were reported yesterday, bringing the French total
this year to 99 and the total since 1998 to 180. Three cases of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the human equivalent of BSE. have been
identified in France.
Unlike Britain, which allows consumption only of animals younger than 30
months, France has no age restrictions on cattle entering the food chain.
The Government has rejected an offer by the FNSEA, the main farmers' union,
to halt the sale of cattle born before 1996, the year that British beef was
banned and tighter restrictions were imposed on animal feed.
The Government decision on feed, depicted as temporary, will mean stocking
a million tonnes of unused animal-based feed. This will cost tens of
millions of pounds and raise the risks, already faced by Britain, of
environmental damage. The switch to vegetable-based feed for all French
livestock will mean a big demand for soya-bean and rapeseed, much of which
will have to be imported. France is also worried that imported soya-based
feed could contain genetically modified material.

Panic over BSE spreads to Italy
-------------------------------
Normally impervious to the fear sweeping Europe over "mad cow" disease,
Italy was gripped by sudden panic yesterday as the Government ordered
"immediate tests" on all beef cattle more than two years old. Schools
banned red meat on lunch menus and the media said that a woman in Florence
with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) may have eaten infected meat.
In Milan, Florence, Genoa, Alessandria, Verona and Civitavecchia the school
ban on red meat was to take immediate effect. In Rome, schools will follow
suit from Monday. Alfonso Pecoraro Scanio, the Agriculture Minister, said
that beef cattle over 2 years old - 800 000 in all - would be tested
immediately, and all meat sold in Italy would be obliged to carry a label
saying where the animal had been farmed and slaughtered.
Umberto Veronesi, the Minister of Health, sought to calm hysteria, saying
that there was "no cause for alarm". There had been only 2 confirmed cases
of cattle infected with BSE in the past 5 years in Italy and in both cases
the cows had been imported from Britain. He assured Italians that the meat
in Italian butchers' shops was "perfectly safe", but from now on Italy
should only import "beef off the bone". He said that banning meat in
schools was an over-reaction.
Signor Veronesi said there had been 364 cases of CJD in Italy since 1993,
but none had any proven link to BSE.
Corriere della Sera said EU inspectors had carried out tests this year to
check whether Italy was complying with anti-BSE measures. The inspectors
said that controls at slaughterhouses were "often inadequate, if not
downright non-existent". As a result, Italian foodstuff factories using
meat products and by-products may have used "contaminated ingredients".
