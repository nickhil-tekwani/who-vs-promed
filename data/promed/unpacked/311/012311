Louisiana horse owners advised to be on the alert
-------------------------------------------------
Horse owners, beware. Agriculture and Forestry commissioner Mike
Strain says a tick-borne disease has shown up in Texas and that horse
owners in Louisiana should be on the alert.

The disease is called equine piroplasmosis, or EP for short. It's a
tick-borne disease caused by microscopic parasites of the red blood
cells. Texas animal health officials say 101 horses at a ranch in
Kleberg County, Texas, have tested positive for EP. The ranch is near
Corpus Christi.

EP symptoms include weakness, loss of appetite, fever, anemia,
jaundiced mucous membranes, swollen abdomen and labored breathing.

[Readers are encouraged to see ProMED-mail post 20091021.3617 for
information about the disease.

Ectoparasites are responsible for a number of different diseases and
over the years have become resistant to many pesticides. This disease
and the tick that caries it are one such example. It behooves everyone
with animals to be on the look out for ticks. Ticks like certain
places, such as ears, tails, heads, genital regions, mid belly, and
mid back. Those are places an animal has a hard time scratching but is
easy for a tick to get a blood meal. There are other places where
ticks can be found, but these are often good areas to start a search.
Remember, ticks can be tiny so look carefully. - Mod.TG]
