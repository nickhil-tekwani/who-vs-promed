On September 18 the media in Peru reported a case of probable Hantavirus
Pulmonary Syndrome in the city of Matarani-Mollendo (a port in the south,
nearly 800 km from Lima). The suspected case is a Chilean person who
became sick [upon arrival at that city. Mollendo is 300 km from the
Peru-Chile frontier. No official confirmation of this has been reported to
date.

[It is quite clear by now that hantaviruses are causing human illnesses
throughout this hemisphere, indeed essentially throughout the world. The
exceedingly complex epidemiologic picture can only be clarified by
molecular and antigenic studies of each virus, in each location, and with
each virus-vertebrate host pair. One positive aspect of all these human
cases is that the recognition of hantaviruses as widespread agents might
serve to decrease the panic level. Another positive aspect is that with
more frequent recognition, education will become more common and reduction
in infection rates more likely. -- Mod CHC
