http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/measles-rubella-monitoring-oct-2012.pdf


Measles and rubella are targeted for elimination in Europe by 2015. ECDC closely monitors progress towards interruption of endemic transmission of both diseases through enhanced surveillance and epidemic intelligence. Measles and rubella vaccinations are routinely delivered in the form of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in Europe, and the 1st of the 2 recommended doses is normally given during the 2nd year of life.

- The 29 contributing EU [European Union] and the EEA [European Economic Area] countries reported 5360 cases of measles from 1 Jan to 31 Aug 2012 and 8547 cases during the last 12-month period from September 2011 to August 2012.

- Reporting was complete for the 12-month period, with the exception of Austria that did not report for September 2012.

- France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom accounted for 92 percent of the reported cases.

- The number of reported cases is substantially lower in 2012 compared to the same period in 2011, but the notification rate for the last 12-month period continues to exceed the elimination target.

- During the last 12 months, just 9 countries reported less than one case of measles per million population, and the aggregated notification rate for the EU/EEA countries was 16.8 cases per million.

- Of the cases reported in the last 12-month period for which vaccination status was available, 83 percent were unvaccinated. 12 percent (1054) of the cases were under one year of age, and of these, 99 percent were reported as being unvaccinated.

- There have been no measles-related deaths during the last 12 months, but 10 cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis.

- Measles transmission continued at the European level, but no new large outbreaks have been reported since the previous report.

Measles - Surveillance data
-----------------------
The enhanced measles surveillance data were retrieved from the European Surveillance System (TESSY) on 27 Sep 2012, and the analysis covers the 12-month period from 1 Sep 2011 to 31 Aug 2012. 29 countries reported case-based data for the entire period, with the exception of Austria, which did not submit data for September [2011 or 2012?].

The number of cases and notification rates for the past 12 months are shown in the following Table.

Country Total cases / Cases per million

Austria 34 / 4.0
Belgium 69 / 6.4
Bulgaria 3 / 0.4
Cyprus 1 / 1.2
Czech Republic 21 / 2.0
Denmark 2 / 0.4
Estonia 3 / 2.2
Finland 6 / 1.1
France 1152 / 17.7
Germany 205 / 2.5
Greece 3 / 0.3
Hungary 7 / 0.7
Iceland 0 / 0.0
Ireland 201 / 44.9
Italy 832 / 13.7
Latvia 3 / 1.3
Lithuania 2 / 0.6
Luxembourg 3 / 5.9
Malta 1 / 2.4
Netherlands 10 / 0.6
Norway 6 / 1.2
Poland 52 / 1.4
Portugal 8 / 0.8
Romania 3409 / 158.8
Slovakia 1 / 0.2
Slovenia 2 / 1
Spain 1077 / 23.3
Sweden 31 / 3.3
United Kingdom 1403 / 22.5

Total 8547 / 16.8

Reported cases in 2012 are much lower than for the same period in 2011, and there was no increase in cases at the European level during the peak transmission season from February to June 2012.

The highest notification rate was among infants under one year of age (210.5 cases per 1 000 000 population), followed by children aged between one and 4 years (102.6 cases per 1 000 000 population).

Vaccination status was known for 7637 (89 percent) of the 8547 reported cases, and of these: 83 percent (6331 cases) were unvaccinated; 13 percent (978) had received one dose of measles vaccine; 4 percent (303) had received 2 or more doses; and 0.3 percent (25) had received an unknown number of doses. The proportion of unvaccinated cases was high across all age groups, including those between one and 4 years old, the age group targeted by vaccination programmes.

Ten cases were complicated by acute measles encephalitis over the last 12 months, but there were no measles-related deaths reported.

Since the beginning of the year [2012], 12 281 cases of measles have been recorded in Ukraine. During the past week (up to 31 Oct 2012), a total of 57 suspected measles cases has been registered, mostly in the western region of Ukraine, namely 12 in Lvov region, 6 in Ternopil region, 5 in Volyn region, and 11 in Kiev region. According to the regional medical authorities, overall, approximately 18 000 Ukrainians may have contracted measles.

The increase in measles cases has been attributed to incomplete vaccine coverage. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease, and measles vaccine should be administered at one year, 6 years, and again at 12-15 years of age. Those aged 29-30 years of age are at greatest risk, since their (innate) immunity may have declined in the absence of revaccination, according to O. Nazar, chief immunologist in the Kiev region.

[The persisting high incidence of measles virus infection in Ukraine is a consequence of past problems associated with purchase of sub-standard vaccine.

The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Administration said it has recorded cases of measles virus in 3 of the 6 area councils in the territory. Secretary of the FCT Primary Health Care Development Board, Dr. Rilwan Mohammed, who disclosed this yesterday [6 Nov 2012], said that the listed councils include Gwagwalada, Kuje and Bwari.

Mohammed, who was speaking on the sidelines at a state level training during Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health Week (MNCHW) organized for senior health officials in the FCT, said the board was already working to contain the disease and prevent a recurrence. "The affected areas have come to collect more vaccines from us, and even though we don't have the actual number of people affected, we have started massive vaccination and have given out over 1000 vaccines," he said.

Speaking in an earlier address to declare the training workshop open, he said the MNCHW was one of the key interventions of the board in area councils, with focused awareness and service delivery on maternal, newborn and child health care.

Mohammed recalled that the last MNCHW held in June 2012 recorded 61 per cent vitamin A coverage, 64 per cent Albendazole, and 42 per cent iron folate coverage and urged the trainees to work hard during the MNCHW, scheduled to commence on 17 Nov 2012, to surpass the record.

He also urged them to transmit what they would be taught during the training to health workers in all the health care facilities in the territory and to also mobilise eligible women and newborn children to avail themselves of the services to be offered during the weeklong programme. Some of the trainees were optimistic that the training would enable them shift to a more integrated approach towards offering qualitative primary health care service delivery.

The incidence of measles cases in different areas of North Darfur has increased to 77, as compared to the 52 cases registered before [the Festival of Eid al-Adha, the Ministry of Health of North Darfur announced on Mon 5 Nov 2012. According to the ministry, the affected areas are El-Sref Beni Hussein, Kabkabiya, and Saraf Omra. In the latter, 15 new cases have been reported in addition to the 10 cases already registered, it was pointed out.

The Director of the Ministry of Health in North Darfur, Dr. Munir Mohammed Mattar, attributed the increase of measles cases to the densely populated gold mining area of Jebel 'Amer, which employs 60 000 workers. Mattar announced the formation of a joint initiative between the states of Central, West, and South Darfur aimed at quickly intervening and reducing the spread of the disease. In addition, the director denied that people infected with measles are dying, and he denied the existence of yellow fever in North Darfur [but see comment below]. Lastly, Mattar asserted that there is no link between cases of yellow fever and of measles in North Darfur.

[Regarding the occurrence of yellow fever, in fact Sudan's Federal Health Ministry announced that the number of yellow fever cases in Darfur has increased to more than 143, including 63 deaths, according to Radio Dabanga on Sun 4 Nov 2011. The Ministry confirmed the emergence of new cases among the population in the southern regions of El-Geneina in West Darfur and the adjacent areas in Central Darfur, see ProMED-mail post: Yellow fever - Africa (10): Sudan (Darfur) 20121106.1395260.

According to Wilkipedia, Darfur is a region in western Sudan. An independent sultanate for several hundred years, it was incorporated into Sudan by Anglo-Egyptian forces in 1916. The region is divided into three federal states: North Darfur, South Darfur and West Darfur. Because of the war in Darfur between Sudanese government forces and the non-Arab indigenous population, the region was in a state of humanitarian emergency between 2003 and 2011.

Mpelembe Secondary School in Kitwe has recorded 3 more suspected measles cases. This brings the number of cases [reported] on Wed 17 Oct 2012 to 53. School principal Margaret Chilando and clinic sister-in-charge Dorothy Bolla confirmed this development yesterday [Mon 22 Oct 2012] in separate interviews. Two pupils have since been quarantined. Ms Bolla said 2 grade 9 pupils and a girl from the school township were cases recorded yesterday [22 Oct 2012]. She said the district health management team had collected samples and taken them to Lusaka [the capital city] for examination. "However, the situation is under control, and those isolated are in stable condition," Ms Bolla said.

The school recorded 49 cases of measles on Wednesday last week [17 Oct 2012], thus compelling management to prematurely close non-examination classes.

Measles hasn't been seen in the Saskatoon Health Region in the past 15 years, but on Thu 25 Oct 2012, the region reported a case of the disease. Parents of infants should check their children's vaccination records, said Julie Kryzanowski, the region's medical health officer.

About one in 4 children younger than 2 are not properly covered by the vaccine because their immunizations are not up to date, she said. "We're at about 76 per cent coverage rate for children under 2 years with 2 doses, so public health will be calling parents of children who are behind with their measles vaccine," Kryzanowski said. "We've set up extra drop-in clinics in Saskatoon and some of the surrounding communities of our health region starting Saturday [27 Oct 2012] and running through next week."

Measles can be quite serious. "If somebody isn't protected by immunization, and they are exposed to a case of measles, over 90 per cent will be infected," Kryzanowski said. "Whenever we see a single case of measles, we are concerned about the risk of an outbreak because measles is so contagious." While rare, there are cases seen across the country. "Most of the cases of measles that we do see in Canada are sporadic cases and usually attributed to travel internationally or people coming from overseas to Canada and bringing the measles virus with them."

The case here has been linked to a case in Prince Albert reported last month [September 2012]. The case is a woman who lives in one of the more rural areas of the region and who began feeling symptoms on 13 Oct 2012 before being diagnosed on 16 Oct 2012. The incubation period is between 7 and 21 days, so there is still a week left before the region will know for sure whether anyone else was infected.

Health officials have traced the contacts of the woman to see whether anyone she was in touch with began developing symptoms. Currently, no one else is showing signs of measles.

Woodland Primary School [Cowlitz County, Washington state] is alerting parents and guardians that a student has a case of measles, a highly contagious viral disease. Superintendent Michael Green sent home a letter with students on Thursday [1 Nov 2012] listing the symptoms and the precautions taken by the Woodland School District.

The Cowlitz County Health Department and the district have thoroughly reviewed the immunization history of every student at Woodland Primary School and found 25 students who must be excluded from school due to either not being vaccinated for mumps, measles and rubella (the MMR vaccine) or to only having had one of the 2 required doses.

"We are taking serious precautions to notify everyone of this situation and make you aware of our efforts," Green wrote. "The district is offering a free immunization clinic on Mon 5 Nov 2012 for students who have only had one shot." After receiving shots, a student may return to school, but if symptoms develop despite the shot, the student must stay home.

The child with measles may have been exposed to the virus while on a trip to California, said Hilary Gillette-Walch of the county's health department. The child has not been hospitalized, she said. Green said the district is closely following Health Department guidelines to control measles in the school setting.

Measles signs and symptoms appear 7-14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the Mayo Clinic website. They include: fever, dry cough, runny nose, sore throat, inflamed eyes (conjunctivitis), sensitivity to light, tiny white spots with bluish-white centers found inside the mouth on the inner lining of the cheek, and a skin rash made up of large, flat blotches that often flow into one another.

Globally, measles remains one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable death among children, killing more than 100 000 children in the world each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2000, measles was declared eliminated in the United States, but measles continues to be imported, the CDC said. Last year [2011], there were 222 measles cases reported in the U.S. and 17 measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases linked in time and place).

The last cases of measles in Cowlitz County were reported in 1999.
