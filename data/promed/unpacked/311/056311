Scientists have discovered 2 spots on the H5N1 bird flu virus which would
need to mutate for the virus to infect people more easily. H5N1 is largely
a disease in animals [birds] because it has surface proteins which bind
more easily to "receptors" lining respiratory tracts of birds, rather than
receptors in humans [mammals]. Experts fear H5N1 will infect more humans
and trigger a pandemic killing millions of people if the virus mutates to
attach easily to human receptors.
In the latest issue of Nature [see below], scientists in Japan, Britain and
the United States said they had discovered 2 specific spots on the genes
of H5N1 which appeared to determine if the virus attached more easily to
bird or human receptors. This discovery will help scientists decide if any
strain of the H5N1 has the potential to cause a human pandemic. "The bottom
line is that the changes (on the 2 spots) can be used as molecular markers
to identify the potential of the viruses that may grow well in humans,"
said Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the Institute of Medical Science at the
University of Tokyo.
Using 21 samples of the H5N1 virus taken from human victims in Indonesia
and Viet Nam, the team of scientists found that 3 of them bound especially
easily to human receptors. "We found many mutations and we tried to
identify which mutations were important ... 2 appeared to be very
important," Kawaoka told Reuters by telephone from the United States.
Kawaoka warned against any over-emphasis on these 2 spots [sites]. "It is
very important that we shouldn't only focus on these 2. The virus can
become human-like by many mutations, these 2 are important but they are not
the only ones," he said. "But these 2 will give indication when a virus has
changed receptor specificity."

[The research described above is reported in the issue of the journal
Nature for Thu 16 Nov 2006 (Nature 444, 378-382;
<http://ealerts.nature.com/cgi-bin24/DM/y/ebF10Spa6e0HjB0BFkn0EW>).
The paper entitled: "Haemagglutinin mutations responsible for the binding
of H5N1 influenza A viruses to human-type receptors" is authored by Shinya
Yamada and 22 others at laboratories in Japan, Viet Nam, Indonesia, the
United Kingdom and the United States.
The Abstract reads as follows: "H5N1 influenza A viruses have spread to
numerous countries in Asia, Europe and Africa, infecting not only large
numbers of poultry, but also an increasing number of humans, often with
lethal effects. Human and avian influenza A viruses differ in their
recognition of host cell receptors: the former preferentially recognize
receptors with saccharides terminating in sialic acid-alpha2,6-galactose
(SAalpha2,6Gal), whereas the latter prefer those ending in SAalpha2,3Gal. A
conversion from SAalpha2,3Gal to SAalpha2,6Gal recognition is thought to be
one of the changes that must occur before avian influenza viruses can
replicate efficiently in humans and acquire the potential to cause a
pandemic. By identifying mutations in the receptor-binding haemagglutinin
(HA) molecule that would enable avian H5N1 viruses to recognize human-type
host cell receptors, it may be possible to predict (and thus to increase
preparedness for) the emergence of pandemic viruses. Here we show that some
H5N1 viruses isolated from humans can bind to both human and avian
receptors, in contrast to those isolated from chickens and ducks, which
recognize the avian receptors exclusively. Mutations at positions 182 and
192 independently convert the HAs of H5N1 viruses known to recognize the
avian receptor to ones that recognize the human receptor. Analysis of the
crystal structure of the HA from an H5N1 virus used in our genetic
experiments shows that the locations of these amino acids in the HA
molecule are compatible with an effect on receptor binding. The amino acid
changes that we identify might serve as molecular markers for assessing the
pandemic potential of H5N1 field isolates."
The significance of this paper is that 2 independent mutations in the HA
protein of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, conferring recognition of human
cell receptors, are located in the crystal structure of the HA molecule
compatible with their inferred effect on receptor binding. Not all H5N1
viruses isolated from human patients, however, exhibited these mutations
and other factors are likely to be involved in the host range phenotype and
pandemic potential of avian influenza viruses. - Mod.CP]
