At least 15 people died and 26 others were injured, 6 critically, after a liquid ammonia leak at a refrigeration unit in Shanghai on Saturday [31 Aug 2013], local authorities said.

The accident took place at about 11 AM at Shanghai Weng's Cold Storage Industrial Co. Ltd. in the Baoshan District, the municipal government announced in a statement posted via its official account on Sina Weibo.

The injured have been rushed to hospital. Six of them are in critical condition, the statement said.

Local authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.

A liquid ammonia leak from a refrigeration unit at a cold storage facility in Shanghai on Sat 31 Aug 2013 has killed 15 people and injured 26 others, local authorities said.

The leak occurred at 10:50 A.M. local time (0250 GMT/10:50 p.m. EDT) at Shanghai Weng's Cold Storage Industrial Co. Ltd., located in the Baoshan district of eastern Shanghai, the Shanghai municipal government said on its official Sina Weibo account.

Six of those injured were in a critical condition, the government said.

China, the world's 2nd-largest economy, has a poor record on workplace safety. In June 2013, at least 120 people died, and 77 were injured when a fire engulfed a chicken processing plant in northeastern Jilin province.

Many of China's deadly industrial accidents happen in the huge coal mining industry, in which more than 1300 people died last year [2012] from explosions, mine collapses and floods.

[This appears to be an unfortunate accident. It nevertheless represents problems for the people involved. Furthermore, there is likely to be some investigation to determine whether it was an accidental leak due to high pressures or faulty equipment or sabotage.

Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most commonly produced industrial chemicals. It is used in industry and commerce, and also exists naturally in humans and in the environment. Ammonia is essential for many biological processes and serves as a precursor for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. In the environment, ammonia is part of the nitrogen cycle and is produced in soil from bacterial processes. Ammonia is also produced naturally from decomposition of organic matter, including plants, animals and animal wastes.

Some chemical/physical properties of ammonia are:
- At room temperature, ammonia is a colorless, highly irritating gas with a pungent, suffocating odor.
- In pure form, it is known as anhydrous ammonia and is hygroscopic (readily absorbs moisture).
- Ammonia has alkaline properties and is corrosive.
- Ammonia gas dissolves easily in water to form ammonium hydroxide, a caustic solution and weak base.
- Ammonia gas is easily compressed and forms a clear liquid under pressure.
- Ammonia is usually shipped as a compressed liquid in steel containers.
- Ammonia is not highly flammable, but containers of ammonia may explode when exposed to high heat.

About 80 percent of the ammonia produced by industry is used in agriculture as fertilizer. Ammonia is also used as a refrigerant gas, for purification of water supplies, and in the manufacture of plastics, explosives, textiles, pesticides, dyes and other chemicals. It is found in many household and industrial-strength cleaning solutions. Household ammonia cleaning solutions are manufactured by adding ammonia gas to water and can be between 5 and 10 percent ammonia. Ammonia solutions for industrial use may be at concentrations of 25 percent or higher and are corrosive.

Most people are exposed to ammonia from inhalation of the gas or vapors. Since ammonia exists naturally and is also present in cleaning products, exposure may occur from these sources. The widespread use of ammonia on farms and in industrial and commercial locations also means that exposure can occur from an accidental release or from a deliberate terrorist attack.

Anhydrous ammonia gas is lighter than air and will rise, so that generally it dissipates and does not settle in low-lying areas. However, in the presence of moisture (such as high relative humidity), the liquefied anhydrous ammonia gas forms vapors that are heavier than air. These vapors may spread along the ground or into low-lying areas with poor airflow where people may become exposed.

Ammonia interacts immediately upon contact with available moisture in the skin, eyes, oral cavity, respiratory tract, and particularly mucous surfaces to form the very caustic ammonium hydroxide. Ammonium hydroxide causes the necrosis of tissues through disruption of cell membrane lipids (saponification) leading to cellular destruction. As cell proteins break down, water is extracted, resulting in an inflammatory response that causes further damage.

Inhalation: Ammonia is irritating and corrosive. Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia in air causes immediate burning of the nose, throat and respiratory tract. This can cause bronchiolar and alveolar edema, and airway destruction resulting in respiratory distress or failure. Inhalation of lower concentrations can cause coughing, and nose and throat irritation. Ammonia's odor provides adequate early warning of its presence, but ammonia also causes olfactory fatigue or adaptation, reducing awareness of one's prolonged exposure at low concentrations.

Children exposed to the same concentrations of ammonia vapor as adults may receive a larger dose because they have greater lung surface area-to-body weight ratios and increased minute volumes-to-weight ratios. In addition, they may be exposed to higher concentrations than adults in the same location because of their shorter height and the higher concentrations of ammonia vapor initially found near the ground.

Skin or eye contact: Exposure to low concentrations of ammonia in air or solution may produce rapid skin or eye irritation. Higher concentrations of ammonia may cause severe injury and burns. Contact with concentrated ammonia solutions such as industrial cleaners may cause corrosive injury including skin burns, permanent eye damage or blindness. The full extent of eye injury may not be apparent for up to a week after the exposure. Contact with liquefied ammonia can also cause frostbite injury.

Ingestion: Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia from swallowing ammonia solution results in corrosive damage to the mouth, throat and stomach. Ingestion of ammonia does not normally result in systemic poisoning.

There is no antidote for ammonia poisoning, but ammonia's effects can be treated, and most people recover. Immediate decontamination of skin and eyes with copious amounts of water is very important. Treatment consists of supportive measures and can include administration of humidified oxygen, bronchodilators and airway management. Ingested ammonia is diluted with milk or water.
