The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has concluded its investigation of the
case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) confirmed on 16 Apr 2006, in
a cow from British Columbia.
The investigation, conducted in line with international guidelines,
identified 148 animals, including the affected animal's herdmates and
recent offspring. From this group, 22 live animals were located and all
tested negative for BSE. One additional animal, which is currently
pregnant, has been placed under quarantine and will be tested once it has
calved. Of the remaining animals investigated, 77 had died or been
slaughtered, 15 were exported to the United States and 33 were untraceable.
Because BSE investigations typically involve older animals, it is common
for a portion of the herdmates to go untraceable due to lack of records.
The Agency examined feed to which the affected animal would have been
exposed early in its life, when cattle are most likely to develop BSE.
Efforts to identify potential routes of transmission included reviews of
records and procedures at the farm, retail and production levels. While a
specific source of infection was not found, investigators determined that
vehicles and equipment used to ship and receive a variety of ingredients
likely contaminated cattle feed with the BSE agent.
Investigators also identified a feed ingredient supplier common to this
case and Canada's 4th BSE animal, confirmed on 22 Jan 2006. This potential
link suggests that all of Canada's BSE cases fall within the same
geographic cluster, which is reflective of feed sourcing, production and
distribution patterns. The clustering theory is explained in the
epidemiological report Canada's Assessment of the North American BSE Cases
Diagnosed From 2003 to 2005, which is available on the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency's website.
The investigation noted high compliance with the requirements of Canada's
feed ban. Such findings -- which have been observed during other
investigations and regular inspections of feed mills, renderers and
retailers across the country -- confirm the presence of limited
opportunities for contamination during feed manufacture, transportation,
storage and use. With an eye to eliminating these risks, the Agency
continues its progress toward enhancing Canada's feed ban. Proposed changes
would prohibit the use of potentially harmful cattle tissues as ingredients
in any animal feeds.
