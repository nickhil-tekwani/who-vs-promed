Sequence analysis from the Netherlands 2006 and comparison to other
European strains
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
During 2006 the 1st outbreak of bluetongue ever recorded in northern
Europe started in Belgium and the Netherlands, spreading to
Luxemburg, Germany, and north-east France. The virus overwintered
(2006-2007) reappearing during May-June 2007 with greatly increased
severity in affected areas, spreading further into Germany and
France, reaching Denmark, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and the UK.
Infected animals were also imported into Poland, Italy, Spain and the
UK.

An initial isolate from the Netherlands (NET2006/04) was identified
as BTV-8 by RT-PCR assays targeting genome segment 2. The full genome
of NET2006/04 was sequenced and compared to selected European
isolates, South African vaccine strains and other BTV-8 strains,
indicating that it originated in sub-Saharan Africa.

Although NET2006/04 showed high levels of nucleotide identity with
other 'western' BTV strains, it represents a new introduction and was
not derived from the BTV-8 vaccine, although its route of entry into
Europe has not been established.

[The Discussion chapter in the paper includes the following 2
passages pertaining to the Bulgarian event. - Mod.AS]:

1. These analyses indicate that NET2006/04 is not derived from the
BTV-8 vaccine strain, which was used as part of the South African
'Group B' multivalent live attenuated vaccine (containing BTV-3, 8,
9, 10 and 11) in Bulgaria during 2000. However, there was some
serological evidence indicating BTV-8 infections of sentinel animals
in Bulgaria during 2006, even though attempts to isolate or detect
the virus by RT-PCR were unsuccessful. [See commentary for the
characteristics of the mentioned BTV-8 vaccine strain. - Mod.AS]

2. Despite also belonging to different serotypes, Seg-5 from the
1999 strain of BTV-16 from Greece (GRE1999/13) is also very similar
to BTV-9 from Bulgaria (99.9 percent) indicating that they have also
been involved in a recent reassortment event.

[The modified live bluetongue virus serotype 8, which is included in
bottle B of the South African vaccine, is reportedly of strain
Camp/8438, origin RSA, 1937. Its passage history is the following:

1. 50 passages in eggs;
2. 3 passages in baby hamster kidney cells (BHK);
3. 10 large plaque selections;
4. 7 passages in BHK cells.

For subscribers' convenience, we include herewith some electronically
available data on the Bulgarian BTV history:

1. Outbreaks of BTV-9 were reported by Bulgaria for the first time
in 1999 (Jul, 17 outbreaks; Aug, 28; Sep, 40; total 85 outbreaks) and
in 2001 (Sep, 10; Oct, 2 outbreaks; total 12 outbreaks).

2. According to the European Commission Decision 1999/606/EC of 27
Aug 1999, Bulgaria obtained a financial contribution from the
Community for the acquisition of 100 000 doses of bluetongue vaccine
for an emergency vaccination campaign in the provinces of Bourgas,
Jambol and Hasskovo.

3. According to EFSA scientific report on Bluetongue (adoptd by the
Animal Health and Animal Welfare committee on 27 Apr 2007), the
vaccination in Bulgaria was carried out in Sep 1999 in lambs and in
March 2000 in sheep, with a "pentavalent MLV (modified live virus)
vaccine probably imported from South Africa: Bottle B- serotypes 3,
8, 9, 10 and 11."
FAO/EMPRES Bulletin NO. 18/3 - 2001, "UPDATE ON VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES
IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN", included the following statement:
"later. Bulgaria also resorted to vaccination in 1999/2000, using a
pentavalent (serotypes 3, 8, 9, 10 and 11) imported from South
Africa, but did not intend to vaccinate in 2001." See at
<ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/Y2283E/Y2283E00.pdf>.

4. Bulgaria reported to the OIE that the number of vaccinations was
6853 in 1999 and 56 293 in 2000.

5. According to Bulgaria's notifications to the OIE, an outbreak of
bluetongue was recorded again, namely during October-November 2006,
affecting sheep, cattle and goats in 13 locations in the Bourgas
region, adjacent to the Turkish border. The 4 follow-up reports and
the summary of the event, with map, are available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=2316>.
No serotype nor details of the diagnostic test applied, which was
named "basic" and led to "positive" results, were included in the
notifications.

6. According to the information included in posting 20061124.3347,
specific BTV-8 neutralising antibodies have been detected by the
Pirbright Community Reference Laboratory in 3 of the 4 sentinel
calves sampled in November 2006 in Bourgas; PCR was negative and no
virus was isolated.

Subscribers may also refer to chapter 3, "Modified live virus (MLV)
vaccines" in the paper "Vaccines against bluetongue in Europe" by
Savini, MacLachlan et al., in Comparative Immunology, Microbiology
and Infectious Diseases, Vol 31, 2-3, March 2008, Pages 101-120. The
said chapter includes, under "safety," the following articles: Fever
and sickness; Effect on pregnancy; Effect on semen; Milk production;
Duration and titer of viremia. Recent observations from Europe are
presented.

1996, suspected to be caused by a BTV-8 strain, see G.H. Gerdes
