A Taiwanese man suffering from a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis
(TB)took 2 flights to reach China last week [16-22 Jul 2007],
prompting a hunt for passengers who traveled with him, officials said.
The 55-year-old man, breaking a travel ban, flew out of Kaohsiung in
Taiwan on Dragonair flight KA 435 to Hong Kong on 21 Jul 2007,
accompanied by his wife, who is also suffering from TB.
The couple then took Dragonair flight KA 810 to Nanjing in eastern
China, according to a statement from Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control.
The couple's flight comes after a US lawyer set off international
alarms in May [2007] for fleeing across borders when he was thought
to be infected with the most dangerous form of TB, or extensively
drug-resistant TB [XDR], which is extremely difficult to treat. The
US man has since been confirmed with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB),
which is less dangerous, but still difficult to cure.
The Taiwan man, who was not identified, also has MDR-TB, which is
resistant to 2 major drugs, the disease control center said. There
are 2nd-line drugs that can treat this form of TB.
His 57-year-old wife suffers from standard TB, which is more
treatable, but she is deemed to be infectious.
More than 270 people were on the 1st flight and over 120 were on the
2nd, but authorities were looking for those who sat in the same row
as the couple and those who sat in the 2 rows in front and behind
them. "They will be sent for checks and if they display symptoms,
they will be given medication," said a spokeswoman for Hong Kong's
Health Department, adding that Taiwan was also trying to track down passengers.
TB is a highly infectious disease that is spread by coughing and
sneezing, and kills about 1.6 million people a year. One of every 3
people in the world is infected with dormant TB bacteria but it is
only when a person's immunity is low that the TB bacteria becomes
active and symptoms show.
The Taiwanese disease control center said the couple was staying with
relatives in Nanjing, and Taipei had dispatched a medical officer to
help them obtain treatment in China and arrange their journey home.
Taiwan prohibits people with MDR-TB from any air travel and those who
flout the rules can be fined TWD 150 000 (approx USD 4550).

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall
[This news release reports another, and likely not the last,
international commercial airplane traveler with apparently infectious
MDR tuberculosis. In addition, the traveler's wife who has
antibiotic-susceptible tuberculosis, accompanied him on the trip.
In response to reports in the 1990's of the transmission of
tuberculosis during long flights from contagious travelers to other
passengers and crew, WHO published regulations for travelers,
physicians and health authorities, and airline companies.
(see <http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_TB_2006.363_eng.pdf>).
These regulations state clearly that: "People known to have
infectious TB must not travel by public air transportation until at
least 2 weeks of adequate treatment have been completed. Patients
with MDR-TB should not travel until they have been proved to be
non-infectious (that is, culture-negative)."
Details of how authorities became aware of the patient's and his
wife's travel and what efforts were made to prevent their travel are
not disclosed in this news release. However, amplification is given
in a Taiwan CDC release that states: "On [24 Jul 2007], Taiwan CDC
identified 2 TB cases that traveled in a commercial aircraft to China
when reviewing the passenger departure record obtained from the
National Immigration Agency."
(see <http://www.cdc.gov.tw/index_news_info.asp?data_id=2369>
Tuberculosis is acquired through inhalation of aerosolized
respiratory secretions that contain _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from
a contagious person who is coughing, talking, or sneezing. The risk
of transmission is related to the infectiousness of the person with
tuberculosis, the duration of exposure, the proximity to the source
person, and the ventilation. The durations of the 2 airplane flights
in the current incident are not specified in the news release above,
but from past experience the risk seems only to exist for flights
longer than 8 hours; in addition, from past experience, the risk for
airborne transmission is limited to the passengers in the immediate
vicinity of the infectious traveler. The Taiwan CDC release states
that the duration of each flight was less than 8 hours and therefore
they believe that risk to other passengers is negligible.
(see <http://www.cdc.gov.tw/index_news_info.asp?data_id=2369>)
The Taiwan CDC consequently "does not recommend the passengers and
crew to immediately undergo medical examination or X-ray examination."
(see <http://www.cdc.gov.tw/index_news_info.asp?data_id=2373>)
Also unknown from the news release above is the degree of
infectiousness of the 2 travelers with tuberculosis; that is, what is
the extent of their pulmonary disease on chest X ray, are they
coughing, are their stained sputum smears or cultures positive for
tubercle bacilli, and are they on antibiotic therapy and for how long.
(see <http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2006/WHO_HTM_TB_2006.363_eng.pdf>).
However, the Taiwan CDC release states that the wife "has also been
determined to be infectious (sputum positive) at this point" (see
<http://www.cdc.gov.tw/index_news_info.asp?data_id=2369>). - Mod.ML]
