S&S Food Import Corp. is recalling all packages of Uneviscerated Dried Roach (Vobla) with the package code: "Best Before 06.05.2015."

Analysis of the product by New York State food Laboratory personnel confirmed that the fish had not been properly eviscerated prior to processing. It may be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum spores_ which [if they germinate] can cause botulism, a serious and potentially fatal food-borne illness.

No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

The uneviscerated dried roach (Vobla) was distributed nationwide in 5-kg boxes.

Consumers who have purchased the recalled product are advised not to eat it and should return the product to the place of purchase.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most of the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

Vobla, also spelled wobla, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vobla) is a Russian word for a fish called the Caspian roach (_Rutilus caspicus_, formerly recognized as subspecies of the common roach). Salt-dried vobla is a common Russian meal or snack that goes well with beer. It is popular in many Russian households and beer restaurants.

The following is abstracted from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulations Section 540.650: Uneviscerated Fish Products that are Salt-cured, Dried, or Smoked (CPG 7108.17) http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgfod/cpg540-650.htm:

Uneviscerated, salt-cured, whole fish products have caused several outbreaks of botulism and death. _C. botulinum_ spores are ubiquitous in fishery products and the marine environment. The spores represent a public health hazard when conditions are suitable for vegetative cell growth and toxin production.

A total of 3 outbreaks of botulism, causing 3 deaths and 11 illnesses, resulted from "kapchunka" in the USA between 1981 and 1987. Kapchunka, an ethnic food usually produced from whitefish, is also known as "rybetz," "ribeyza," or "rostov." Kapchunka is an uneviscerated, salt-cured, air-dried, whole fish, which may or may not be smoked. It is consumed without further preparation, such as cooking. The fish are salt-cured under minimum refrigeration conditions for a minimum of 25 days and then air dried at ambient temperature for 3 to 7 days. Kapchunka may be smoked before packing and are commonly stored under refrigeration.

In 1991, 2 botulism outbreaks occurred. In one, "faseikh" was implicated in at least 91 illnesses and 18 deaths in Egypt. Faseikh is a traditional product made by fermenting uneviscerated fresh mullet for up to one day and then salt-curing it in barrels, which may be tightly sealed from one week to one year. In another, an ethnic fish product called "moloha" caused a botulism outbreak involving 4 family members in New Jersey. Moloha is an uneviscerated, salt-cured fish product similar to "faseikh." The preparation steps in the New Jersey incident were not identified since the source of the "moloha" could not be found.

Other salt-cured products, such as "bloaters," can also pose a public health hazard. Bloaters are prepared by salt-curing uneviscerated whole herring, which may or may not be smoked. Bloaters may be transformed into other products, such as fillets or bloater paste. In addition to the products noted above, whole fish that are dried, pickled, or fermented can also pose a public health hazard. The referenced episodes of botulism are representative of a well-documented history of life-threatening health hazards associated with uneviscerated, salt-cured fish.

The problems with these products are compounded by the difficulty in attaining sufficient levels of salt in all portions of an uneviscerated fish to inhibit the growth of _C. botulinum_. Consequently, any fish product that is salt-cured and then dried, smoked, pickled, or fermented can pose a public health hazard. Toxin may be present in these products even when there are no outward signs of microbiological spoilage or other clear indications to alert the consumer. - Mod.LL
