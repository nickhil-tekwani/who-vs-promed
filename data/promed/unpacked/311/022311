Health authorities in south China's Shenzhen city have identified sodium
nitrite as the cause of a mass food poisoning that left 2 people dead and
61 people in hospital on Saturday [23 Feb 2008]. The health bureau of the
city's Longgang district said the investigation had focused on a restaurant
in which food and water samples were found to be contaminated with the
chemical. The news was announced as 42 people were discharged from hospital
on Sunday [24 Feb 2008], leaving 19 -- all described as stable -- still
receiving treatment.

63 workers of BYD Company Ltd suffered stomach aches, vomiting, and other
symptoms around 11:00 am on Saturday [23 Feb 2008] after having lunch at a
restaurant near their workplace in Longgang district. Two died after
treatment failed. The other 61 had been removed from critical care, 42 of
whom left hospital at around 3:00 pm on Sunday [24 Feb 2008] after
recovering, according to the Health Bureau of Longgang district.

"We knew that the restaurant had poor hygiene, but its food was cheap, so
we liked to have lunch there," said Wei Tangwei, one of the 19 people who
were still in hospital.

Sodium nitrite, similar in appearance to salt, is used as an industrial
color fixative, but is also used in small amounts as a meat preservative.
But police have ruled out the possibility that the chemical was mistaken
for salt or sugar by the chefs. Health experts warned that 0.2 grams of
sodium nitrite could poison an adult and 3 grams were enough to kill.

Local police and health officers have begun questioning the manager of the
restaurant, patients, and employees of BYD Company.

[Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial
action converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism
responsible for botulism poisoning. Generally, sodium nitrite has replaced
sodium nitrate, except in slow-cured hams.

Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the
spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes
botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word botulinum
comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which was responsible
for many deaths centuries ago before cured with nitrite. In addition to
serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite is used to produce the characteristic
flavor, texture, and pink color of cured meats.

At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in
hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin, which
does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood. Symptoms of
methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heart
rate), weakness and dizziness. As decreased oxygenation of tissues becomes
truly inadequate, dyspnea (shortness of breath), acidosis, arrhythmias
(irregular heart rhythms), coma, convulsions and even death may occur.

Methemoglobin is an abnormal hemoglobin that is not capable of carrying
oxygen or carbon dioxide. In adults and normal children, the level of
methemoglobin is less than one per cent of the total hemoglobin. Acquired
methemoglobinemia (presence of methemoglobin in the blood) results when the
rate of formation of methemoglobin exceeds the rate of reduction after
exposure to certain compounds. Nitrites and aniline derivatives are
substances which most frequently produce methemoglobinemia. Because of its
use as a meat preservative and its similarity in appearance to table salt,
sodium nitrite is frequently the cause of methemoglobinemia. Nitrites are
also present in many medicinal agents. Most reports of nitrate-induced
methemoglobinemia, however, are due to infants given well water
contaminated with high levels of nitrates. Nitrate salts are converted by
enteric bacteria to nitrites, which are then rapidly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract. Silver nitrate used on burns is also a common
source, as bacteria infecting burns may similarly cause nitrite production.

Aniline and its derivatives are found in many household products such as
inks, shoe polishes, paints and varnishes, and in some red and orange wax
crayons. Other drugs commonly associated with methemoglobinemia include
phenacetin, sulfonamides, and pyridium. Benzocaine, a common ingredient of
topical anesthetics has also been known to cause marked cyanosis from
methemoglobinemia.

Treatment involves general supportive care and removal of any offending
toxins. The drug of choice for treating severe methemoglobinemia is
methylene blue. Severe cases may require exchange transfusion or the use of
ascorbic acid.

Shenzhen is located in the southern portion of the Guangdong Province, on
the eastern shore of the Pearl River Delta. Neighboring the Pearl River
Delta and Hong Kong (located just south of Shenzhen), Shenzhen's location
gives it a geographical advantage for economic development. - Mod.TG]
