We agree with the ProMED moderator that details of the obtained titers
or O.D. and exact nature of the lab formats used for the hantavirus
screening of the current Nellore cases could be very helpful. As
indicated already in a previous 4 Feb 2010 ProMED-mail post (archive
no. 20100205.0385), we found in 2006 and in ELISA and immunoblot
formats not only evidence of the murine Seoul virus (SEOV) infection,
but also of the arvicoline Puumala virus (PUUV) infection, the latter
in 2 fatal cases (from the Cochin, respectively Chennai region) with
symptoms similar to those now described in the Nellore cases. In the
meantime, we found similar serologic evidence for PUUV-like infection
in non-fatal hantavirus cases in Sri Lanka, considered as
leptospirosis cases, some of which also presented with cough or
dyspnea.

Wild rat-transmitted SEOV can be found worldwide but is, with about 2
per cent case fatality rate, mostly mild, and affects in humans more
the liver than the lung. However, as recently showed again in Sweden,
PUUV can also involve the lungs as well as the kidneys, leading to a
fatal form of viral ARDS [acute respiratory disease syndrome]
(Rasmuson J, Andersson C, Norrman E, Haney M, Evander M, Ahlm C. Time
to revise the paradigm of hantavirus syndromes? Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome caused by European hantavirus. Eur J. Clin Microbiol Infect
Dis 2011; 30:685-690).

In Europe and Russia, however, PUUV infections are spread by bank
voles (_Myodes glareolus_), but this rodent is absent from India, as
are all other related species of the Arvicolinae subfamily.
Consequently, PUUV cannot be expected to be endemic in India, and we
had to do with cross-reactions. Sri Lanka is a country neighbouring
India, with fauna very similar to it, including the total absence of
rodent species of the Arvicolinae subfamily.

As indicated already in our ProMED-mail post no. 20100205.0385, RT-PCR
on all these "PUUV-positive" sera, including the 2 fatal cases, was
negative for all hitherto known hanta-viral pathogens, including PUUV
and Thottapalayam virus (TPMV), with a positive control on live TPMV.
It should be noted, however, that, in comparison to SEOV and other
murine hantaviruses found in the Far or South East, PUUV is
genetically more closely related to the American hantaviruses, giving
in 35 per cent a lethal form of viral ARDS, called hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a picture reminiscent of the current Nellore
cases.

Given the fact that TPMV, the only indigenous hantavirus with a
documented presence in India, is genetically completely distinct from
all other known rodent-borne and even from most of the many (now over
21) recently discovered insectivore-borne hantaviruses, it seems
improbable that TPMV should give cross-reactions with PUUV in
serology. Moreover, no human pathogenicity is known for TPMV, as it is
for all other insectivore-borne hantaviruses so far. However, we
recently presented retrospective (1987 and 1991) evidence of what
might be the first clinical description of insectivore-borne human
hantavirus disease, both with mainly renal involvement. One patient
was bitten by a water shrew (_Neomys fodiens_), the other splashed in
the face and on his clothes with blood of a common mole (_Talpa
europaea_), decapitated with his spade. Remarkably, in an IFA battery
with several species of the then different pathogens (Hantaan [virus],
SEOV and PUUV), PUUV yielded the highest titers (manuscript in
preparation).

There are several relatively simple and quick lab tests to support a
suspicion of an ongoing hantavirus infection, such as initial
proteinuria and thrombocytopenia, high leukocytosis with a left shift,
elevated levels of LDH and CRP (surprisingly for a virus infection),
and the "lipid paradox" consisting of very low serum cholesterol,
contrasting with high triglycerides. A very peculiar and pathognomonic
clinical sign, present in 50 per cent of hanta [virus], and 25 per
cent of PUUV cases, is blurred vision by acute myopia, noted shortly
after the onset of fever, but never reported so far in American HPS
cases. Paradoxical bradycardia (under 60 beats/min) despite the fever,
might be another sign.

Our National Reference Laboratory for Hantavirus Infections offered
last year to Indian health authorities and doctors different screening
and confirmation techniques such as ELISA, different forms of RT-PCR
(including pan-hanta PCR), and a new variant of neutralisation test
(NT), based on PCR, but Indian sera appeared difficult to obtain.
Moreover, we are also ready to perform on short notice a very
demanding new technique, called pyrosequencing. However, this test
requires fresh serum samples, sent in optimal conditions on dry ice,
but requires above all a high degree of familiarity with the many
fallacies of hantavirus results interpretation. If the Nellore health
authorities are willing to send us fresh serum samples of recent
suspect cases, we are willing to help them.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Clement and colleagues for this interesting
discussion and evaluation of current and past hantavirus infection
cases in India. One hopes that Indian Health authorities will take
advantage of their very generous offer of help with laboratory
diagnosis of these cases. Isolation of the virus (or viruses) involved
in these cases would be of particular interest, as it would provide an
opportunity for comparative genetic studies of the viruses circulating
in India and their relationships to other hantaviruses. Building on
Dr. Clement's and colleagues' previous hantavirus studies in India
cited below, that would make a significant contribution to our
understanding of the bio-geography of hantaviruses in the Indian
subcontinent and Asia in general.
