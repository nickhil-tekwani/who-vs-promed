Murray Valley encephalitis [MVE] has been found in sentinel chickens in the Katherine region [Northern Territory].

The [Australian] Centre for Disease Control (CDC) said the infected flock indicates the mosquito-borne virus is widespread, along with Kunjin virus.

CDC director Vicki Krause said symptoms of the Murray Valley encephalitis include severe headache, high fever, drowsiness, and tremor. In some cases the disease can cause delirium, coma, permanent brain damage, or even death, she said in a release. It can also cause seizures, especially in young children, where fever can be an early sign of the illness, she said.

"If the child also has drowsiness, floppiness, poor feeding, or general distress, parents should consult a doctor," she said.

A 19-year-old Canadian tourist died last year [2011] after contracting the disease while on a 10-day tour of the Northern Territory.

Kunjin virus was also found in the flock. The virus causes high fever, headache, and muscle pain.

The diseases [viruses] are spread by the common banded mosquito and the floodwater mosquito which breed in grassy depressions and sewage ponds, the CDC said.

Top End residents are urged to protect themselves and especially children from mosquito bites.

The CDC advises to:
- avoid outdoor exposure around dusk and at night, near rivers and areas of dense vegetation, as well as other areas of high mosquito activity;
- consider bifenthrin insecticide barrier treatments by pest control companies around homes;
- use mosquito-proof accommodation and camping facilities at night;
- wear protective light-coloured clothing with long sleeves, long trousers, and ankle protection with socks, between dusk and dawn in areas where mosquito bites are likely;
- use repellent containing 20 per cent DEET or picaridin and other mosquito protection devices when out at night in areas of mosquito activity.

[MVE virus has been found circulating in the far northeast of Western Australia state earlier this year (2012), and now it, and Kunjin virus, are being transmitted in the Northern Territory. One hopes that the CDC advice is taken seriously. No vaccines are available for either of these viruses, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only practical preventive measure.

As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment of 17 Apr 2010 (ProMED-mail archive number 20100417.1251): In the 8th ICTV Report Kunjin virus and West Nile virus are grouped together (as members of the West Nile virus species), whereas Murray Valley encephalitis virus is considered to be close to Alfuy virus (together forming the Murray Valley encephalitis virus species). Both species are members of the Japanese encephalitis virus group of flaviviruses.
