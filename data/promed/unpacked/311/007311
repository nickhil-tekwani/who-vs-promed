Despite completing the injection course required to prevent rabies, a
person was found to be infected at a major city hospital, while
another [contracted rabies] because he didn't complete the vaccination
process. Both of them have slipped into coma.

Doctors say that after a dog bite, the patient should complete the
injection course and immediately go for an antibody titre test to
check if enough anti-genes [that is, sufficient antibodies] have been
produced in the body. Experts also feel that there should be more
awareness of rabies as many people do not complete the vaccination
course and risk their life in the process.

Dr Abhay Chowdhary (director, Haffkine institute for training,
research and testing, Parel) said, "Rabies injections are 99 per cent
effective. In some cases, an individual with an immunity level that is
not very strong can get the infection even after completing the
injection course. Sometimes, patients do not respond to vaccination."

Talking about the need to have more awareness on rabies, Dr Om
Shrivastav (infectious diseases specialist, Jaslok hospital) said,
"Getting a rabies infection after completing the vaccination course is
very rare. What is worrying is people's attitude towards rabies. Most
of the time, patients delay treatment. There are others who do not
complete the vaccination course. They need to understand that dog
bites have to be taken seriously."

In India, according to WHO estimates, the number of human deaths
resulting from rabies infection, is about 1.7 to 3.3 per 100 000
inhabitants (about 25 000-30 000 deaths per annum).

[An implication of this report is that a comprehensive public
education programme together with improved access to post-exposure
treatment might have more immediate effect on the extent of human
rabies virus infection in India than control of canine rabies alone.
