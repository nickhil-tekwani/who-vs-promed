SCIEH Weekly Report, 8th July 1997 (no.97/27): resume of the Borders outbreak
--
Between 26 June & 1 July 1997, 69 people fell ill with diarrhoea, all but two
of whom had consumed cold cooked meat supplied and prepared by a butcher in
St. Boswell's in the Borders Health Board area. 65 of these have so far been
confirmed as suffering from infection with a Group D salmonella and all
isolates forwarded to the Salmonella Reference Laboratory have been
identified as _Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type 4. A group D salmonella has
also been identified in a sample of meat supplied by the butcher.
Four cases were admitted to hospital but all have now been discharged. The
outbreak was declared over on 7 July 1997 and the Scottish Borders Council
Environmental Health Department is working with the butcher who had ceased
selling [distributing] cold cooked meats on 1 July 1997 [and] ensure that his
premises are safe before resuming business.
