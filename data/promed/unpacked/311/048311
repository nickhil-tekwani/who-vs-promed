Almost 100 people have now been affected by an outbreak of
gastroenteritis linked to a bread shop in Sydney's west. Sydney South
West Area Health Service (SSWAHS) is investigating the outbreak
involving 98 people, many of whom ate products from a Homebush hot
bread shop on the past weekend.
[Of the affected people], 18 have been hospitalized and public health
officers are currently interviewing [the rest]. All of the cases
interviewed so far had eaten either pork rolls or chicken rolls from
the French Golden hot bread shop in Homebush West. So far, 13 have
been confirmed as having salmonellosis.
The Public Health Unit is warning anyone who may have eaten these
food products from the bread shop between Fri 23 Mar and Tue 27 Mar
2007 to watch out for the symptoms of salmonellosis and seek medical
care. Common symptoms usually last 4 to 7 days, and include nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.
The New South Wales Food Authority has sent inspectors to the bread
shop to examine food safety practices and to take samples for
laboratory testing. In the meantime, the bread shop has been
prohibited from producing or selling the implicated foods.

Tasmania's Health Department is testing food samples to try to find
the cause of a salmonella outbreak in the state's northwest. A
Somerset bakery has been closed after it was linked to the outbreak 2
days ago. At least 14 people in the northwest have been struck down
with salmonella poisoning in 2 weeks; 2 of them went to hospital with
dehydration, and the director of public health, Roscoe Taylor, says
the number of reports may rise.
Dr Taylor says several of the patients had eaten food from VJ's
Bakery in Somerset. "[It] first came to our attention last week with
a couple of cases that we weren't able to connect together, and then
over the weekend, it became clearer with further laboratory
notification that we had a problem," he said. "I think that we've
isolated at least one source. "The particular food business has
voluntarily closed while we try and sort out what the underlying
causes were within the premises there."
Dr Taylor says uncooked eggs, contaminated minced meat, and unwashed
hands are among the possible causes. He says all salmonella cases are
investigated under Public Health laws. Dr Taylor says the bakery has
a good record of hygiene and food handling, and its link to the food
poisoning has not been officially confirmed.
Other shops and suppliers are also being investigated. Health
officials are interviewing patients and testing samples today to try
to find the cause. The Health Department says it contacted local
general practitioners on Fri 23 Mar 2007, asking them to test any
patients with gastroenteritis symptoms. It says all the victims of
the salmonella outbreak are recovering well.

[We are posting these clusters together because of their
similarities. More information is needed to assess whether the
clusters are caused by the same serotypes and are related. Whether
the filling or the bread of the meat rolls is the source of the
salmonellosis is not yet clear.
