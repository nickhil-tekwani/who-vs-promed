2 Jul 2018. Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Return of the Japan Disaster Relief Infectious Diseases Response Team
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan [edited]

Introduction
---------------------
In response to the outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD), the government of Japan (GOJ) dispatched the Japan Disaster Relief Infectious Diseases Response Team (JDR-IDRT) from [Mon 11 Jun 2018-Sat 30 Jun 2018] upon the request from the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The JDR-IDRT consists of a total of 14 members, including 7 technical experts in the areas of epidemiology, public health, and laboratory.

Prior to the JDR-IDRT deployment, an assessment team of the GOJ was dispatched to identify the gaps to be filled for containing the current outbreak of EVD. Based on the consultations with the Ministry of Health of the DRC, World Health Organization, and other relevant organizations, the team focused on some challenges on the ground such as the weakness of quarantine at points of entry (PoEs) in Kinshasa, [DRC], the insufficient data management at PoEs, and the shortage of trained staff at the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB) due to temporary allocation to mobile laboratories in the Equateur province.

Activities
-------------
1) Points of entry
Training of Trainers (ToT) for quarantine officers: The team joined the preparation of ToT for quarantine officers as well as for trainees of the Field Epidemiology Training Program organized by the National Program of Hygiene at Borders (PNHF) along with WHO, IOM, UNICEF, US-CDC, and FHI360. The team also provided a training session for hand hygiene and infection prevention and control (IPC) with necessary equipment during the training held on [Mon 11 Jun 2018-Tue 12 Jun 2018].

Strengthening PoE at Maluku: PNHF has established 5 prioritized PoEs to scale up surveillance of EVD in Kinshasa with a view to prevent the capital city of the DRC from the spread of EVD. The team supported one of the prioritized PoEs, Bende Bende, Maluku commune, the northern part of Kinshasa city, by providing essential materials to carry out effective quarantine. Applying all equipment, each step of quarantine was properly separated and easy to control the flow of the passengers. One of the trained trainers of above-mentioned ToT took the lead on capacity development of all staff at Bende Bende and ensured how to deal with suspected cases, including isolation of patient, which aligned with SOP developed by the PNHF.

Data management: Regarding the procedure of quarantine and contact tracing, the team advised the selection of items of the registration form and the means of data archiving. It was confirmed that the registration form covers sufficient information to detect and report the alerts or EVD suspected cases among passengers at the PoEs. As a next step, the team advised PNHF to improve the linkage of data among PoEs, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory, and clinical management.

2) Laboratory
Upon request of INRB EVD Laboratory, the team inspected each step of the current procedures from collecting samples to getting diagnostic results. It turned out that lab workers were well trained, and the laboratory was equipped with enough materials necessary to mitigate exposure risk during sample manipulation. It was also found that laboratory diagnosis of EVD was promptly conducted upon a sample receipt. With these findings, the team concluded that INRB EVD Laboratory has adequate capacity to respond to the current outbreak.

The team tested EVD-negative samples to rule out other infectious diseases such as yellow fever and dengue fever, while providing the INRB EVD Laboratory with reagents, consumables, and positive control. Then, for the future outbreaks, the team trained the lab staffs for further strengthening their capacity of carrying out the EVD diagnoses based on the new protocols brought by the team, which proposes the lab staff an alternative diagnostic method.

[Organizations from around the world responded generously to the DRC outbreak, just as they did to the West African Ebola virus epidemic. This emergency international public health response to Ebola, as well as to other global threats of epidemic-prone and emerging diseases, is a wonderful demonstration of how countries can coordinate activities and work together to achieve an end that is beneficial to all. - Mod.LK

5 Jul 2018. Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) [edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/07/news-scan-jul-05-2018


Surveillance activities in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) continue to identify and test new suspected Ebola cases, but no more confirmed cases have been reported over the past few days as the country edges closer to declaring the outbreak over.

In a [Tue 3 Jul 2018] situation report, the World Health Organization (WHO) said since [Tue 26 Jun 2018], 13 more suspected cases were identified: 10 from Bikoro, 2 from Iboko, and one from Wangata Health Zone in the provincial capital city of Mbandaka. Two rounds of testing have ruled out the disease in 11 of the patients, and 2nd-round test results are still pending for 2 other people who tested negative in their initial tests.

The total number of cases is 53, which includes 38 confirmed, 15 probable, and 2 suspected cases. The number of deaths remains at 28. Though the outbreak is largely contained, there is still a risk of flare-ups due to undetected transmission chains and the risk of sexual transmission by some male survivors, the WHO said.

Strengthened surveillance is in place, along with a survivor-monitoring program, according to the WHO, which added that the revised risk has been downgraded to moderate for the DRC and low for the regional and global levels.

[3] WHO Disease Outbreak News
6 Jul 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
Disease Outbreak News [edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/06-july-2018-ebola-drc/en/


[excerpt:] The Ministry of Health and WHO continue to closely monitor the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Contact tracing activities concluded on [Wed 27 Jun 2018] after the last people with potential exposure to the virus completed their 21-day follow-up without developing symptoms. Over 20 000 visits to contacts have been conducted by the field team throughout the outbreak.

On [Tue 12 Jun 2018], the last confirmed Ebola virus disease patient in Equateur Province was discharged from an Ebola treatment centre, following 2 negative tests on serial laboratory specimens. Before the outbreak can be declared over, a period of 42 days (2 incubation periods) following the last possible exposure to a confirmed case must elapse without any new confirmed cases being detected. Until this milestone is reached, it is critical to maintain all key response pillars, including intensive surveillance to rapidly detect and respond to any resurgence.

In light of progress in the response, WHO has revised the risk assessment for this outbreak (see section below).

From [Sun 1 Apr 2018] through [Tue 3 Jul 2018], a total of 53 Ebola virus disease cases, including 29 deaths (case fatality ratio 55 percent), were reported from Equateur Province. The total includes 38 laboratory-confirmed and 15 probable cases (i.e., suspected cases that died without the opportunity to collect samples for laboratory testing). Cases have been reported from 3 health zones: Bikoro (n=21; 10 confirmed, 11 probable), Iboko (n=28; 24 confirmed, 4 probable), Wangata (n=4; all confirmed) (Figure 2). Five cases were health-care workers, of which 4 were confirmed cases and 2 died.

From [Tue 3 Jul 2018 through Thu 5 Jul 2018], the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, conducted a strategic operations review to assess the current epidemiological situation, evaluate progress against the Ebola virus disease Strategic Response Plan, engage in initial lesson learning, and prioritize key activities and resources for continued vigilance in affected areas through to the end of the outbreak. The review included the development of a 90-day enhanced surveillance and response plan for the continuation of core activities after the end of the outbreak, as well as planning for sustaining local and national capacities for ongoing health emergency response across the DRC. The Ebola treatment centres will remain operational and continue to provide clinical care to suspected cases.

The Ministry of Health continues to lead the response in the affected health zones with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include the strengthening of surveillance and contract tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC), case management, community engagement, safe and dignified burials, response coordination, and vaccination. Additionally, to avoid the spread of the disease from affected provinces to non-affected provinces and to other countries, the DRC has put into place cross-border surveillance at points of entry (neighbouring at-risk zones, provinces, countries, and important travellers' congregation points). WHO continues to work closely with the Ministries of Health from 9 neighbouring countries to strengthen preparedness to mitigate the risk of international spread.

- Since the launch of the vaccination intervention on [Mon 21 May 2018] through [Sat 30 Jun 2018], a total of 3330 people have been vaccinated in Iboko (1530), Wangata (893), Bikoro (779), Ingende (107), and Kinshasa (21). Populations eligible for ring vaccination include front-line health professionals, people who have been exposed to confirmed Ebola virus disease cases (contacts), and contacts of contacts. A total of 2020 vaccine doses are available in the central vaccine stores, and 870 doses are in Mbandaka.

- Intensive surveillance activities are ongoing, including active case searching at the community and health-facility levels, real-time investigation of alerts, and laboratory testing of all suspected cases to confirm or exclude Ebola virus disease. From [Sun 13 May 2018] through [Tue 3 Jul 2018], 728 alerts were investigated, and 387 individuals meeting the suspected case definition were tested.

- WHO is supporting the Ministry of Health to establish a one-year programme for care to survivors. The programme will be focused on 3 axes: clinical follow-up, counselling and semen testing, and psychosocial support. A workshop to launch the project will be held in Mbandaka from [Fri 6 Jul 2018 through Sat 7 Jul 2018].

- Risk communication, social mobilization, and community engagement activities continue in the area with support for active community-based alerts for epidemic prone diseases, addressing rumours related to Ebola virus disease and reduction of stigma against survivors.

- As of [Fri 6 Jul 2018], WHO has deployed a total of 332 technical experts (217 international, 115 national) in various critical functions of the Incident Management System (IMS) to support response to the EVD outbreak, including 20 experts from the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) partner institutions.

- WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event. As of [Fri 6 Jul 2018], no restriction of international traffic was put in place. Based on informal sources available publicly, 25 countries have implemented entry screening for international travellers coming from the DRC during this outbreak.

- To date, no exported cases have been reported. The risk of missed cases able to travel outside of Equateur Province and internationally during the incubation period (2-21 days) is considered very low. However, it was decided to maintain exit screening at points of entry and congregation sites as a precautionary measure and to prepare a deactivation plan for after the end of the outbreak.

[4] Sierra Leone: Serological study
5 Jul 2018. Serological Evidence for the Circulation of Ebolaviruses in Pigs, Sierra Leone
The Journal of Infectious Diseases [edited]
https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiy330

[Citation: Kerstin Fischer et al., Serological Evidence for the Circulation of Ebolaviruses in Pigs from Sierra Leone. The Journal of Infectious Diseases, jiy330.]

Abstract. Many human ebolavirus outbreaks have been linked to contact with wildlife including nonhuman primates and bats, which are assumed to serve as host species. However, it is largely unknown to what extent other animal species, particularly livestock, are involved in the transmission cycle or act as additional hosts for filoviruses. Pigs were identified as a susceptible host for Reston virus with subsequent transmission to humans reported in the Philippines. To date, there is no evidence of natural Ebola virus (EBOV) infection in pigs, although pigs were shown to be susceptible to EBOV infection under experimental settings. To investigate the potential role of pigs in the ecology of EBOV, we analyzed 400 porcine serum samples from Sierra Leone for the presence of ebolavirus-specific antibodies. Three samples reacted with ebolavirus nucleoproteins but had no neutralizing antibodies. Our results (1) suggest the circulation of ebolaviruses in swine in Sierra Leone that are antigenically related but not identical to EBOV and (2) could represent undiscovered ebolaviruses with unknown pathogenic and/or zoonotic potential.

Conclusions. In conclusion, we provide the 1st serological evidence of ebolavirus-specific antibodies in pigs from West Africa, suggesting that African pigs have been in contact with and can be infected by ebolaviruses or ebola-like viruses. However, based on epidemiological evidence, it seems rather unlikely that pigs played an important role in the EBOV ecology in the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa. Future comprehensive studies, including animal infection experiments, will be necessary to further understand and define the role of pigs in the ecology of ebolaviruses.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Folkers for submitting this paper. The gorilla (_Gorilla gorilla_), chimpanzee (_Pan troglodytes_), and duiker (_Cephalophus_ sp.) have been implicated as Ebola virus hosts, and bats have long been postulated as a potential reservoir host. But once the virus has spilled out of the sylvatic cycle, it is not known whether other animals may become infected and contribute to the transmission cycle.

Serologic evidence of infection in animals is difficult to interpret because of cross-reactions between virus strains and among viruses, added to lack of knowledge about how long-lasting antibodies are in pigs. However, since earlier studies indicated susceptibility of pigs to Ebola virus, this serosurvey conducted in Sierra Leone following the West African outbreak was an opportune time to address the question of the involvement of pigs. The results are not clear-cut, indicating the need for more field studies. - Mod.LK]

[The following excerpt from the Discussion segment of the paper includes some additional background related to Reston virus ("Reston ebolavirus"; RESTV; see 20090203.0482, 20160327.4121931):

"Although RESTV is believed to be a virus of Asian origin, antibodies specific to RESTV antigens have recently been found in the African straw-colored fruit bat (_Eidolon helvum_), suggesting the circulation of Reston or Reston-like viruses in a greater geographical range than previously anticipated including Africa. We found at least 2 African pigs with RESTV NP (cross-) reactive antibodies.

"However, since we observed considerable serological cross-reactivity among the different ebolavirus species tested in our study, it remains to be investigated whether RESTV or Reston-like ebolaviruses circulate in the African pig population.

Intriguingly, a one-year-old African pig that tested positive for ebolavirus IgG in our study used to live on a farm with contact to the surrounding bush habitat and potentially to wildlife. Another positive one-year-old pig was reported living free range inside a community, thus enabling contact to both human and wildlife populations. It still remains unclear whether African pigs can play any role as a potential intermediate host transmitting ebolaviruses to humans causing infection." - Mod.AS
