I'm an infectious disease specialist at Martha's Vineyard Hospital and have
seen 3 of the 4 confirmed cases of tularemia this summer. One child was
reported to have acquired the ulceroglandular form in April of this year.
That patient was from the Boston area and had visited the Vineyard and
acquired the disease via a tick bite. The other 3 cases that I have
personally seen in consultation have been confirmed by convalescent
serology (through the Massachusetts Dept of Public Health) had the
pneumonic form. They are all males who had worked extensively as grass and
brush cutters in various parts of the island. They all presented in nearly
the same way: rather sudden onset of fatigue and fever (some to 104 degrees
F), moderate to severe headache, dry cough beginning around 48 hours into
the illness and persistence of fever in spite of oral antimicrobials
(amoxicillin) in 2 cases. All have been admitted to Martha's Vineyard
Hospital and resolved with IV once daily gentamicin, in addition to either
IV ceftriaxone or levofloxacin (to treat other community acquired
organisms).
Laboratory data include slightly elevated transaminases (60 to 100) but
unremarkable white counts. A rather interesting clue (also noted in some
of the pneumonic cases last summer) is the finding of nearly normal breath
sounds on exam but diffuse multi-lobe infiltrates on chest x-ray when done
on day 3 or 4 of the illness. No sputum is produced, blood cultures have
been negative. Physical exam is otherwise unremarkable. These patients are
quite fatigued but remain alert with mild hypoxemia.
One case was very slow to resolve with progression of infiltrates, a
pleural effusion and fevers that persisted for 8 days.
I'll be happy to discuss any questions with physicians who may be
diagnosing illness in persons who have visited Martha's Vineyard. A lovely
place to visit, but it has an interesting collection of tick-borne diseases.
