Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection in Organ Transplant Recipients -
- Massachusetts, Rhode Island, 2005
-----------------------------------
On 3 May 2005, CDC received a report of severe illness in 4 patients who had
received solid organ transplants from a common donor. All 4 organ recipients
subsequently were found to have evidence of infection with lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a rodent-borne Old World arenavirus.
Preliminary findings from the ensuing investigation indicate the source of
infection likely was an infected hamster in the donor's home. This report
summarizes the ongoing investigation and provides information on exposure
risks and possible prevention measures.
In early April [2005], in Rhode Island, a woman with a medical history
remarkable only for hypertension and one week of headache had sudden onset
of hemiplegia caused by a stroke, followed by brainstem herniation and brain
death within 3 days. A thorough evaluation was not suggestive of infection.
Family members of the woman consented to donation; organs and tissues were
recovered, including the liver, the lungs, both kidneys, both corneas, and
skin. Within 3 weeks after transplantation, the 4 persons who received the
liver, lungs, and 2 kidneys had abnormalities of liver function and blood
coagulation, and dysfunction of the transplanted organ. Signs, symptoms, and
clinical laboratory test results varied in these patients and included
fever, localized rash, diarrhea, hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, hypoxia,
and kidney failure. 3 of the 4 organ recipients died, 23 to 27 days after
transplantation. The 4th patient, a kidney recipient, survived.
Histopathologic findings varied in the 4 cases, but hepatocellular necrosis
was common to all 3 decedents on autopsy. The 2 cornea recipients were
asymptomatic. Skin was not transplanted.
When the cause of illness among the recipients was not identified through
extensive diagnostic testing and suspicion of transplant-transmitted
infection arose, tissue and blood samples from the donor and recipients were
sent from the Rhode Island Department of Health and the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health to CDC. LCMV was identified as the cause of
illness in all 4 organ recipients; diagnosis was made in tissues from
multiple organs through immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(i.e., IgM capture and indirect IgG), and viral culture on Vero E6 cells.
Sequencing of the virus genome confirmed its identity as LCMV. Based on the
diagnosis of LCMV infection, the surviving kidney transplant recipient was
treated with intravenous ribavirin and reduction in his immunosuppressive
drug regimen; the patient improved clinically.
Epidemiologic Investigation
---------------------------
To determine the source of LCMV infection, investigations were conducted at
the hospitals involved in organ recovery and transplantation and at the
coordinating organ procurement organization. Interviews also were conducted
at locations where the donor had spent substantial time in the month
preceding her death.
Interviews with hospital and organ bank staff members revealed no likely
sources of LCMV infection in the hospital or organ-recovery settings.
Environmental assessment at locations the donor frequented (e.g., home and
work) revealed limited opportunities for exposure to wild rodents; the sole
location noted with rodent infestation was a garden shed at her home.
Interviews with family members of the donor determined that a pet hamster
had been acquired recently. The hamster was cared for primarily by another
family member. No illnesses compatible with LCMV had been reported in the
donor or family members during the month preceding the donor's death.
Further investigation of the source of infection, including rodent
traceback, is ongoing.
Laboratory Investigation
------------------------
Family members of the donor were tested for LCMV antibodies. The family
member who cared for the hamster had specific IgM and IgG antibodies to
LCMV. No other family member had detectable IgG or IgM antibodies to LCMV.
All available donor tissues were tested, and no evidence of LCMV was
determined by serology, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, or viral culture.
However, the pet hamster was determined positive for LCMV by virus
isolation, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. Genetic sequencing to enable
comparison of patient and rodent virus isolates is planned.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
LCMV infection usually is either asymptomatic or causes mild self-limited
illness in otherwise healthy persons. LCMV can cause aseptic meningitis, but
the infection is rarely fatal (1). Infection during pregnancy can result in
vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus; LCMV infection
during the 1st or 2nd trimesters can lead to severe illness in the fetus
(2). Serologic studies conducted in urban areas of the United States have
indicated that prevalence of LCMV infection among humans is approximately 5
percent (3,4). The house mouse (_Mus musculus_) is the primary reservoir for
LCMV, with a prevalence of infection of 3-40 percent; a high degree of
focality often is noted (3,5,6). However, other types of rodents (e.g.,
hamsters or guinea pigs) can be infected after contact with infected house
mice (7); these rodents also have been implicated in human infection.
Animals can become ill or can be asymptomatic. Infection in humans occurs
primarily through exposure to secretions or excretions of infected animals
(8).
Human-to-human transmission of LCMV has not been reported, with the
exception of vertical transmission from an infected mother to fetus (2). A
large outbreak associated with pet hamsters sold by a single distributor was
reported in 1975, when 181 symptomatic cases among persons with hamster
contact were identified in 12 states; no deaths occurred (9). In 2003, a
cluster of solid organ transplant-associated meningoencephalitis deaths in
Wisconsin was investigated and determined to be associated with LCMV
infection. In that investigation, testing of donor tissues did not reveal
any evidence of infection (10), and no exposures to rodents were found.
Acute LCMV infection in an organ donor is thought to be a rare event.
In the case described in this report, neither the donor nor the infected
family member had illness characteristic of LCMV infection. In the organ
recipients, transplantation of LCMV-infected organs in the setting of
immunosuppression likely increased disease severity. Although most persons
infected with LCMV do not exhibit symptoms and the risk for LCMV infection
from pet rodents is considered low, persons (especially pregnant women)
should be aware of the possible risks associated with LCMV infection.
Persons can minimize risk of LCMV infection from pet rodents by being
attentive to proper hand hygiene and environmental cleaning. Additional
information on handling pet rodents is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/animals/pocket_pets.htm>.
Additional information on LCMV is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lcmv.htm>.
Health-care providers should be aware that LCMV can be transmitted through
organ transplantation. Any unexpected infectious syndromes in recipients
after solid organ or tissue transplantation should trigger concern about the
possibility of transplant-associated transmission of an infectious agent.
Although such instances are rare, providers should alert the associated
organ procurement organization, tissue bank, and public health authorities
when such events are suspected. The lifesaving benefits from transplanted
organs outweigh the potential risk for unidentified infectious diseases;
opportunities to increase donation should be encouraged.
