Infectious salmon anemia, Norway
--------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 3 Mar 2014 from Dre Kristina Landsverk, Chief Veterinary Officer, Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Ministry of Agriculture and Food, Brumunddal, Norway

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 28 Feb 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 28 Feb 2014
Report date: 3 Mar 2014
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Infectious salmon anemia virus [ISAV]
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (2014/2): Lille Asvaer 10990, Ytre Helgeland, Donna, Nordland
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 Feb 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 2 (scale 0 to 5) / 170 000 / 1000 / 700 / 300 / 0
Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 0.59 percent / 0.41 percent / 70 percent / 0.59 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and / or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: from an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority considers this ISA outbreak at Donna to be a first occurrence. Infectious salmon anemia (ISA) was present at another location 15 km [9.3 mi] away in July 2013 as well. The Norwegian Veterinary Institute uses genotyping to determine whether ISA outbreaks are an occurrence or a reoccurrence. The epidemiological survey relating to this ISA outbreak shows no genotypic association to the previous ISA outbreak at the other mentioned location. Therefore this event is reported as a 1st occurrence. The ISA cases seem to be 2 separate outbreaks without any epidemiological correlation, although both of them belong to the same administrative region, Nordland. The virus relating to the outbreak will be further characterized associated with the epidemiological studies.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); emergency harvest; tracing forward; tracing back; surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; official destruction of aquatic animal products.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / histopathological examination / 28 Feb 2014 / positive
Norwegian Veterinary Institute (regional reference laboratory) / Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / real-time PCR / 28 Feb 2014 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The comments made under the "Epidemiological comments" section are quite noteworthy because they highlight the importance of using genotyping to distinguish viral strains. In this case, the Norwegian authorities were able to use the tool to determine that both cases were not related. As the OIE Aquatic Code indicates, "Sequence analysis of various gene segments has revealed differences between isolates both within and between defined geographical areas." (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.05_ISA.pdf)

During 2013, Norway submitted 7 immediate ISA notification reports to the OIE. To date, a total of 10 outbreaks of ISA have been reported (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Countryreports.
