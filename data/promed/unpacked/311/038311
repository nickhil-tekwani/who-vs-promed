[This single case has occurred in the same province, Karlovarsky, as
the previous outbreak that occurred 29 Nov 2007. This new outbreak is
in Dolni Zdanov near Cheb while the previous one was in Stary Rybnik,
also near Cheb. Using the zoom on the map, both farm locations can be seen at
<http://www.maplandia.com/czech-republic/karlovarsky-kraj/cheb/stary-rybnik/>.

Although not separated by great distances, the earlier outbreak is
north of Cheb, whereas this new outbreak is southeast of Cheb.

Of particular interest is the epidemiological comment that the
temperature has been below 10 DEG C (50 DEG F) since the first
outbreak. It is thought that temperatures around 10.5 DEG C (50.9 DEG
F) are the lower limit for activity for _Culicoides imicola_, for
example. This was the temperature used in an interesting article
examining the effects of generally warmer temperatures on Culicoides
distribution -- see Using climate data to map the potential
distribution of Culicoides imicola (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in
Europe. E.J. Wittmann, P.S. Mellor & M. Baylis Rev. sci. tech. Off.
int. Epiz., 2001, 20 (3), 731-740, which can be found at the OIE website
<http://www.oie.int/eng/publicat/rt/2003/A_R2035.htm>.

In any case, it would be very helpful to know the current thinking on
the origin of this particular new outbreak and the role vectors
played in it, given the low temperatures since last December. - Mod. PC]
