A total of 8 lions at an Indian zoo have tested positive for coronavirus in what is believed to be the first case of its kind in the country. Officials at Nehru Zoological Park reportedly decided to test the Asiatic lions for COVID-19 after veterinarians working in the zoo noticed the felines had symptoms of the virus, including loss of appetite and coughing.

The Hyderabad zoo is believed to have been told by The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) that the RT-PCR tests of 8 lions had come back positive on [29 Apr 2021]. Four males and 4 female lions, out of 12 in total on the 40-acre safari area, tested positive for coronavirus, according to Times of India.

The curator and director of Nehru Zoological Park did not confirm or deny the news, claiming that they were yet to receive the RT-PRC reports. Dr Siddhanand Kukrety continued: 'It's true that the lions showed COVID-19 symptoms but I'm yet to receive the RT-PCR reports from the CCMB and hence it will not be proper to comment. The lions are doing well.'

According to sources, the veterinarians were advised to take samples from the lions after the management was informed of the symptoms, which were sent to the CCMB in Hyderabad for testing.

Field vets took samples from the lions' oropharynges (the oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx, behind the mouth) and sent them to CCMB scientists for genome sequencing in a bid to determine if the strain came from humans or animals.

Amid a spike in coronavirus cases across India, Nehru Zoological Park closed its doors to the public 2 days ago [2 May 2021].

Although the lions' cases of coronavirus are believed to be the first of its kind in India, other zoos and national parks have seen rare cases of animals contracting the virus. In December [2021], 4 lions at Barcelona Zoo tested positive for Covid-19, which was thought to be only the third known case in which large felines have contracted coronavirus. Three females and a male were tested after keepers noticed they showed mild signs of coronavirus. Two staff at the zoo also tested positive for coronavirus, veterinary authorities said, after the outbreak was first detected the month before. The Veterinary Service of Barcelona had contacted colleagues at the Bronx Zoo in New York, where 4 tigers and 3 lions tested positive for COVID-19 in April last year [2020].

In at least one other case involving large felines, a tiger tested positive for the virus and 2 more were presumed positive after briefly displaying symptoms at Zoo Knoxville in the US state of Tennessee in October [2020], according to the zoo. "The zoo has contacted and collaborated with international experts such as the Veterinary Service of the Bronx Zoo [...] that has documented cases of Sars-CoV-2 infection in felines," the Barcelona zoo said in a statement.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed so far in carnivores (order CARNIVORA) of 3 families, canids (dogs and raccoon dogs), felids (cats, tigers, lions, puma/cougar, and snow leopard), and mustelids (ferrets and minks). Lions and tigers experienced respiratory disease due to COVID-19 at the Bronx Zoo in April 2020, tigers with mild respiratory signs tested positive at Zoo Knoxville in October 2020, and lions in Barcelona Zoo in December 2020. In January 2021, 1 tiger and 2 lions tested positive at a zoo in Sweden. All infections detected in carnivores were among animals held captive (and therefore exposed to infected people), except for the recent record of a wild mink captured and sampled in Utah. - Mod.PMB
