Farmers of Raydanda in Baglung district are worried after their goats started to die due to a mysterious disease from Tuesday [2 Sep 2014]. The District Livestock Service Office, Baglung, on the basis of symptoms, has suspected an outbreak of peste des petits ruminants [PPR] disease.

The goats have been found to develop symptoms like swelling of the head and dizziness, among others. Chief at the office, Dr Gopal Giri, said that preparation was under way to send a team of veterinarians along with necessary drugs and vaccine to the affected areas.

A farmer, Padam Thapa, said 14 goats of 5 farmers have perished since Tuesday [2 Sep 2014]. Locals said that Halhale and Hadyan of Raudanda are the most affected areas.

[While PPR is considered to be widely spread in Nepal, the described clinical signs -- head swelling and dizziness -- in case accurately described, are not very typical of this disease, which is caused by a Morbillivirus (of the family Paramyxoviridae).

PPR (peste des petits ruminants -- also called goat plague, pest of small ruminants, pest of sheep and goats, stomatitis-pneumoenteritis syndrome and pneumoenteritis complex) -- is characterised mainly by pyrexia, serous ocular and nasal discharges, diarrhoea, pneumonia and erosive lesions on different mucous membranes, particularly in the mouth.

Results of the planned investigation by a veterinary team are anticipated. PPR is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS
