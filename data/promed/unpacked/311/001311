Regarding a recent ProMED-mail posting (Equine Infectious Anemia - USA Utah
07), please note that the EIA positive foals are NOT being housed in an
isolation unit within the teaching hospital here at Oklahoma State
University (OSU). They will be housed in a separate isolation unit some
distance from the main veterinary campus. There has been some concern here
already about having EIA horses in the teaching hospital where client
horses are seen.
