Further to your request for information the Federation of Tour
Operators has been working with the British Health Protection Agency.

One major British package tour operator uses Sarigerme and their
clients stay in either of 2 properties. One of the properties is a
complex with around 3000 guests at any time.

The operator had reports of stomach illness from around 300 guests at
the end of August 2008. They said they had been ill over the previous
week but had not reported it to the representative. A British hygiene
consultant (environmental health officer) was dispatched to the hotel
and apart from a few lapses did not find anything particularly
lacking in the food hygiene. He gave some basic advice including a
reminder to guests on the importance of hand washing. Since then the
illness reports have reduced with 36 over the past week.

The increase in illness has been reflected in the illness data
collected during the return flight using the CSQ (client satisfaction
questionnaire). These are background data that have to be interpreted
with care as bias can easily be introduced; for example, disgruntled
tourists are more likely to complete the CSQs. Nevertheless, the
analysis shows a significant increase in stomach upsets in tourists
returning from the suspect hotel in Sarigerme.

The operator also reports an increase in the number of fecal
accidents in the swimming pool but with formed feces. Previous
experience suggests that these may be deliberate and are related to
impending litigation.

The tour operator has received 3 reports of _Salmonella_ isolates in
the UK from clients who had recently returned from the hotel complex.

The tourist industry can only undertake syndromic surveillance and
relies on the health authorities to undertake any investigation. The
available information has been shared with the Health Protection
Agency.

Monitoring of the situation continues.
