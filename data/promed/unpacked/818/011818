Central high-level team: Nipah virus disease is not a major outbreak. It is only a local occurrence.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following directions of the Union Health Minister, Shri J P Nadda, a multi-disciplinary Central Team led by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is presently in Kerala constantly reviewing the situation of the Nipah virus disease.

After reviewing the cases of all the patients who have lost their lives, the Central High-level Team is of the view that the Nipah virus disease is not a major outbreak and is only a local occurrence. The Team has also further fine-tuned the draft guidelines, case definitions, advisory for healthcare workers, information to the general public, advisories for sample collection and transportation accordingly.

The Central Team held meetings with the District Collectors and the medical and paramedical staff of the hospitals today also to review the condition of the admitted patients and to consider further course of action to be taken to prevent the disease from spreading. The efforts taken so far for containment of the disease have been fruitful as the disease has not spread to new areas. The contact tracing strategy adopted has also been successful. It has been found that all the reported cases including the suspected cases had direct or indirect contact with the 1st casualty/his family prior to contacting the disease.

General awareness among the general public has been encouraging. They have been asked to follow safe hygiene practices, not to consume fruits/vegetables partly eaten by birds/animals and steps to be taken while going near the infected persons/areas. The State Government has also issued advisories in the vernacular. The continued round-the-clock presence of the Central and State Teams in the affected areas right from day one of the outbreak and the surveillance and preventive actions taken by them, have instilled confidence among the public.

The Team also reviewed/discussed with the hospitals the management and treatment of the patients. The treatment procedure adopted by the hospitals for the patients with specific/non-specific symptoms has been found effective. The suspect cases admitted in the Kozhikode Medical College and Trivandrum Medical College are under observation.

All healthcare workers have adopted safe practices for dealing with the patients. The Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare is closely monitoring the situation.

Details of cases and deaths, as on 24 May 2018:
Total number of confirmed cases: 14
Total number of suspected cases: 20
Total number of deaths: 12 (9 from Kozhikode and 3 from Malappuram)

[It will be interesting to see how many of the 20 suspected cases are subsequently confirmed or discarded as cases of Nipah virus infection. Health authorities are proactively attempting to keep this limited outbreak from becoming a major one, and have wisely involved both the medical community and the public in that effort. Although giant fruit bats (genus _Pteropus_) are the likely reservoir of Nipah virus in the area, there is no indication that they have been studied to determine if they have the virus and what the prevalence is in the local populations of this bat. - Mod.TY

After 2 suspected cases of Nipah virus [infection] were found in Mangaluru, there has been one more such case in Gadag, and [Karnataka] state is on high alert.

Dr Suresh Shastri, I/C Joint Director (IEC/Information Education and Communication), Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services said, "There was one suspect found on [Thu 24 May 2018] in Gadag, but we are yet to confirm it. The patient was hospitalised and the blood samples have been sent to Pune for the test."

The Karnataka Health and Family Welfare department also directed all the district hospitals to be on alert and coordinate among each other. The Department Director Dr PL Nataraj said, "The reports are awaited and we have sent out clear instructions to all the district hospitals to be alert."

Many hospitals in the city have set up separate wards as a precautionary measure. KC General Hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Chest Diseases, and Victoria Hospital have made arrangement to isolate patients if there is a need.

Sources at KC General Hospital said that a separate ward with 3-4 beds have been set up along with the doctors and nurses assigned for the same.

BBMP [administrative body of the Greater Bangalore metropolitan area] has also issued various instructions. If a Nipah virus suspect is found in any government or private hospitals within BBMP limits then they will have to inform the Health Department immediately; call 104 for help; inform the health officer. They distributed hand bills as part of creating awareness.

Asha [accredited social health activists] workers are also being trained by the health officers to create awareness among public about Nipah virus.

District health department of Bengaluru Urban Zilla Panchayat [district council] has also spelt out measures to be taken to prevent the disease. Dr Suryanarayana Sharma, Consultant Neuro Physician and HOD [head of department], Department of Neurosciences, BGS Gleneagles Global Hospitals said, "It is critical to use standard barrier nursing techniques with proper isolation of the patients. Timely laboratory confirmation and aggressive epidemiologic tracing of contacts with patient quarantine and isolation can contain spread of virus. This is important because there is no effective specific treatment for the infection."

As it is an emerging disease, there is no passive immunity for this infection. Hence, it can cause severe infection with mortality as high as 75 percent.

Dr Sharma also explained about the infection and the range of symptoms.

Infection starts usually 5-14 days after exposure and the symptom persists for 10-12 days. They range from asymptomatic infection to sudden onset of high fever, headache and rapid progression to drowsiness and coma. Vomiting, breathlessness, giddiness, seizures and focal neurological deficits are also seen. "If you experience a combination of any of these symptoms, visit a physician immediately," he added.

[Interestingly, 2 of the suspected cases in Karnataka, a state bordering Kerala where the 1st cases occurred, have been reported as tested and proved negative (https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/250518/3-nipah-suspects-put-karnataka-on-alert.html). ProMED awaits clarification of the situation in Karnataka state with interest. - Mod.TY]
