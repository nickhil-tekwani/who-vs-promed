Chikungunya [virus] is suspected to have resurfaced in Ganjam district with many persons in Boxipalli village exhibiting symptoms of the mosquito-borne viral disease. It will be confirmed after medical tests, doctors said on Saturday [12 May 2012].

"Doctors and para-medical staff led by district malaria officer (DLO) went to the affected village on Saturday. They treated patients and collected blood samples for diagnostic tests," said S K Patnaik, chief district medical officer [CDMO] of Ganjam. MLA [Member of the Legislative Assembly] (Gopalpur) Pradip Panigrahi asked the CDMO to deploy a medical team in the affected village till the disease is controlled.

The disease was reported from this fishing village 2 days ago. The number of those affected has increased to a dozen with 2 more suffering from fever on Saturday, the CDMO said.

Last month, 9 chikungunya cases were confirmed in Golabandh [in the Balangir district, Orissa state] . "Out of the 22 blood samples tested in Golabandh last month, 9 were found to be positive," the CDMO said. The situation in Golabandh is now normal, he added.

Chikungunya, malaria, dengue and Japanese encephalitis spreads because of stagnant water as the mosquito larva survives in it, a medical officer of social medicine department, MKCG Medical College and Hospital, said. People should prevent water from stagnating, he added. The CDMO said health personnel would create awareness to destroy the stagnant water sources and to dry the water-logging spots in the village. He also said that there is no need to panic as the number of affected persons in the village was very small compared to the population of 2100.

[Chikungunya is endemic in many parts of India, and sporadic cases occur there frequently. One hopes that this small outbreak does not spread and become a large one. This alphavirus is transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes. Concern about the spread is justified because although the case fatality rate is extremely low or nil, morbidity can be high. The severe arthralgia from the infection can be incapacitating, and in some cases may last for weeks or months after the acute infection. Last year (2011) there were many reports of chikungunya virus infections from various parts of India, including one small outbreak in Ganjam district (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110831.2671). There is no commercially available vaccine for chikungunya virus, so mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only preventive measures available.
