Two thousand mallard ducks in Idaho likely died after they ate moldy grain
and contracted a fatal infection, scientists said on Thursday.

Paul Slota, a wildlife expert with the United States Geological Survey's
National Wildlife Health Center, said a fungal infection known as
aspergillosis was the likely killer. "The results are certainly consistent
with that diagnosis," Slota said. Dave Parrish, regional supervisor for the
Idaho Department of Fish and Game, said further tests would be conducted.

The preliminary finding eased fears that the massive mallard die-off, which
experts say is unprecedented in Idaho, was linked to bird flu. Birds can
contract aspergillosis after feeding on waste grain and silage pits during
bad weather, according to the National Wildlife Health Center.

Large scale, rapid die-offs among waterfowl have chiefly affected mallards,
it said. An estimated 2000 mallards died between Friday and Wednesday near
the agricultural community of Burley, about 150 miles (241 km) south east
of Boise.

State fish and game officers on Wednesday retrieved carcasses from a stream
clogged with dead and dying mallards. The stream is surrounded by farmland
and a cattle feedlot, potential sources of the moldy grain, officials said.

Concerns over the deadly H5N1 flu strain and an extensive national
monitoring network prompted officials to submit samples from Idaho to labs
specializing in detecting avian influenza and drew the US Department of
Homeland Security into the investigation.

A similar aspergillosis outbreak killed 500 mallards in Iowa in 2005, the
wildlife health center said. Moldy grain was the culprit in that case. The
disease is not contagious.

[Although aspergillosis is a possibility and has caused high mortality in
the Iowa case, this is not the common picture. It also is unclear as why it
is only mallards and not other birds. There are other possibilities. Read
the next post for a different point of view. - Mod.TG]

The hemorrhage in the heart and the fact that the disease is restricted to
ducks brings to mind DVE (duck viral enteritis).

[Duck viral enteritis, also known as duck plague, is caused by a
herpesvirus. There are many strains of this virus that vary greatly in
their pathogenicity but not their antigenicity. Generally this disease is
characterized by high mortality. It often affects older ducks more
severely. Geese and swans as well as ducks of all ages are susceptible.

Clinical findings may include hemorrhages in various tissues, especially
the heart, liver, pancreas, and mesentery. Though these are not
pathognomonic lesions, they are most prominent. Because death is often
quite sudden, there may be few lesions. Other lesions may be hemorrhages in
the esophagus, oral cavity, cloaca, cecum and rectum. Necrosis and
hemorrhages are present in all the lymphoid tissues.

A good review of DVE can be found on ProMED-mail post 20050602.1537.

Since DVE affects more than just ducks it is still curious that only ducks
in this case are mentioned. Perhaps there are only ducks in the area? -

The US Geological Survey's National Wildlife Health Center has completed
necropsies on 6 mallards and one American wigeon from the Idaho wild-bird
die-off.

Gross observations and preliminary laboratory results are consistent with
acute fungal infection. Body conditions ranged from good with primarily
lung involvement to fair with more advanced fungal plagues throughout the
body. Multiple laboratory tests are pending to confirm genus and species
identity of the fungus and to rule out any other disease problems.
