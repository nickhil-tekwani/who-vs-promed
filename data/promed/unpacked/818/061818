With regard to ceftriaxone-resistant _Salmonella_ acquired from cattle. It
is worth noting that the beta-lactam antibiotic approved for primary
testing, for use in cattle, by the US-FDA is CEFTIOFUR. This antibiotic is
a third generation cephalosporin which exhibits a spectrum of activity
similar to that of cefotaxime (and ceftriaxone).
