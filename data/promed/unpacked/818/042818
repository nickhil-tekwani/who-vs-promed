Many countries in the Americas are experiencing unexpected outbreaks of
cholera associated with extreme weather conditions brought by the arrival
of the El Nino phenomenon.
During 1998, the following countries have already reported cholera
outbreaks: Bolivia (La Paz, El Alto, Valles y Tropico de la Paz) 165 cases
and 5 deaths; Honduras (La Mosquitia in Gracias a Dios Department) 219
cases and 12 deaths; Ecuador (Loja Province) 11 cases and 1 death; Peru
(various departments) 2863 cases and 16 deaths; Nicaragua (border area with
Honduras) 3 suspected cases. It is expected that other countries in the
region will report increased cholera incidence in the coming months.
Preventive and control measures are being taken by the Ministries of Health
of the affected countries. However, as the epidemic enters its 8th year in
the western hemisphere and with the added impact of El Nino, cholera will
continue to challenge governments and health agencies; additional
international resources for emergency preparedness and control measures
will be needed this year. WHO/PAHO are working closely with countries in
the region to reactivate cholera preparedness and response plans.
