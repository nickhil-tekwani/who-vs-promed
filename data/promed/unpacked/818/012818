The CDC has been notified by several states of clusters of pneumonia and other
infections caused by _Burkholderia cepacia_. These cases had exposure to
alcohol-free mouthwash manufactured by Carrington Labs (Irving, TX) for
Medline Industries (Mundelein, IL). Cultures performed by a hospital
laboratory where the first cases were detected indicate that multiple lots of
Medline alcohol-free mouthwash are intrinsically contaminated with _B.
cepacia_. [See recall of similar product by a different manufacturer in 2001 --
ref. below. - Mod.JW]
In August 2005, the Texas Department of State Health Services was notified of
a cluster of nosocomial pneumonia involving 3 patients hospitalized at a Texas
health-care facility.
All 3 patients were intubated and in the intensive care unit for their
underlying illnesses when they developed signs of pneumonia, and respiratory
cultures grew _B. cepacia_. All 3 patients had received oral care using 4 oz.
bottles of Medline alcohol-free mouthwash prior to illness onset. One patient
has recovered and has been discharged. The 2nd and 3rd remain hospitalized,
one with a poor prognosis. Molecular typing is pending.
An additional 2 clusters (2 cases and 5 cases), both associated with prior use
of Medline alcohol-free mouthwash, are currently being investigated in 2
Florida health-care facilities.
CDC is working with state health departments and the FDA [U.S. Food & Drug
Administration] to determine the magnitude of this outbreak. Carrington Labs
analysis of in-house retained samples has confirmed contamination in multiple
lots of the product in both 4-oz. and 2-oz. bottles, leading to a recall of
all alcohol-free mouthwash manufactured by Carrington Labs for Medline.
The suspect product bears a 7 or 8 digit lot number on the bottom of the
bottle; suspect lot numbers include numbers 0503*** through 0508*** and
0503**** through 0508**** (asterisks represent any digit). The product is
available in 2-oz. bottles as well as 4-oz. bottles and was distributed only
to hospitals and long-term care facilities. The product is not distributed for
direct retail sale to the consumer. However, the 2-oz. bottles are packaged
with other items, such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc. by Medline into
a 'personal hygiene hospital admission kit' so some mouthwash may be in the
possession of the consumer within a residential setting. Medline alcohol-free
mouthwash with the above lot numbers should not be used.
Individuals who are aware of cases of _B. cepacia_ colonization or infection
occurring during or shortly after exposure to these products should contact
their health department and CDC at 1-800-893-0485.

[_B. cepacia_ is a nonfermentative, aerobic, Gram-negative bacillus, formerly
classified as _Pseudomonas_. Unlike _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, _B. cepacia_ is
an organism of low virulence with limited ability to cause infection in
humans. _B. cepacia_ survives and multiplies in aqueous hospital environments,
where it may persist for long periods even in distilled water and in certain
antiseptic solutions such as quaternary ammonium salts. - Mod.LL]
