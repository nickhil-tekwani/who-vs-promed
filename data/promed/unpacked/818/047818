A recent typhoid fever outbreak affecting 81 students in a middle
school in central China's Hubei Province was controlled, local
authorities said Friday [26 Dec 2008].

81 students from Bajiao Middle School in the Bajiao Township of Tong
Minority were hospitalized Sunday afternoon [21 Dec 2008]. All of
them, aged between 13 and 15, suffered sustained fever, headache and
diarrhea, Xiang Shilian, vice mayor of Enshi City, told the press
conference; 63 of them were confirmed as typhoid fever cases as of
the morning of 26 Dec 2008. They are now in stable condition after
treatment in the Central Hospital of Enshi.

Local medical staff started to control the outbreak immediately after
the cases were found. All the patients were treated for free and the
rest of the students received vaccinations to prevent the disease, Xiang said.

[Several points about this cluster suggest that this outbreak may not
have been typhoid fever but rather a non-typhoid salmonellosis
cluster. Typhoid tends to have a more prolonged and variable
incubation period (than non-typhoidal disease) ranging from 3 days to
1 month with most cases between 7 and 14 days. Because of this, it
would be more likely that the cases would be hospitalized over a
period of time instead of all at once, as it appears in the narrative.
Likewise, diarrhea as a symptom is much more common in non-typhoid
salmonellosis, whereas typhoid often is associated with constipation.

Authorities in Alotau have revealed at least 20 confirmed cases of
typhoid fever from areas around Losuia station on Kiriwina Island in
the Milne Bay Province. Most cases reported to the Losuia Health
Center have been treated and listed for follow-up for close monitoring.

The situation 1st began in March 2008. The way of life of the
Trobriand Islands people has seen them manage without proper toilets,
but health authorities are moving into the area to encourage proper
hygiene and the importance of proper toilet facilities. Milne Bay
Provincial Health Advisor Jack Purai said they have to work fast to
contain the infection, and a team from his office has been on the
island for 3 weeks now.

He said they are working meticulously to undertake field
investigations, case diagnosis and conduct community mobilization and
awareness prevention campaign programs.

2 children are being treated for potentially deadly typhoid fever at
Dundee's Ninewells Hospital. The siblings had recently returned from
traveling overseas and are receiving antibiotic treatment. Those who
have been in close contact are being tested but doctors have said
they do not believe there is an increased risk to the general public.
It is believed the children's school has been informed, although
individual letters have not been sent out.

Typhoid is common in Africa and South America, but the greatest risk
appears to be on the Indian subcontinent. It is estimated there are
about 13 to 17 million cases of typhoid fever in the world every
year, with an estimated 600 000 deaths.
