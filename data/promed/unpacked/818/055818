The Department of Health (DOH) has recorded a total of 149 cases of the deadly Japanese encephalitis with at least 22 cases in noted Pampanga , the highest in the [Central Luzon] region during the 1st quarter of 2017.

Japanese encephalitis is a viral disease spread by blood-sucking insects, particularly mosquitoes. The mosquitoes of the _Culex_ species are known to be the viral carriers.

The DOH said it affects the nervous system, causes severe complications and even death. The disease can infect not only humans but domestic animals, birds, bats, snakes, and frogs as well.

Among the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis, according to the DOH, are flu-like illnesses, fever, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. The symptoms usually appear 6-8 days after the mosquito bite.

If untreated, patients could suffer brain damage or paralysis as it also affects the spinal cord. In 30 percent of the cases, death could occur. Young children are more vulnerable due to their weak immune system.

While there is no cure, the virus could be prevented through vaccination.

A separate report from the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Japanese encephalitis is an illness that is endemic in the Philippines and is fatal in almost 3 out of 10 serious cases.

The WHO report also said that nearly all survivors of this mosquito-borne disease experience permanent damage, including physical disabilities, cognitive and language problems, learning disabilities and behavioral problems.

[This is a cluster of Japanese encephalitis in central Luzon Island. Clusters have been relatively rare in the Philippines. There have been relatively few reports of human Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases in the Philippines in recent years, although the islands are within the JE virus endemic zone.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. It is caused by a virus transmitted by culicine mosquitoes. Ardeid birds (including herons) are the reservoir species in nature.

Most human infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild symptoms. However, a small percentage of infected persons develop encephalitis, with symptoms including sudden onset of headache, high fever, disorientation, coma, tremors, and convulsions. About 1 in 4 encephalitis cases is fatal. Apparently, none of the cases in the report above died. There is no specific treatment for JE. Patient management focuses on supportive care and management of complications. Steps to prevent JE virus infections include vaccination and use of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites.
