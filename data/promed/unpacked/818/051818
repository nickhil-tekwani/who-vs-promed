New Mexico health authorities are investigating a cluster of salmonellosis cases in the Albuquerque area, including possible exposures linked to sushi. The state Department of Health reports 6 confirmed cases between 4 Apr 2015 and 1 May 2015, with 5 of the 6 people having reported eating sushi containing raw fish.

According to the Health Department, federal agencies and other states also are investigating illnesses associated with the same salmonella strain [serotype Paratyphi].

All 6 New Mexico cases involve adults, including one who has been hospitalized. Five live in Bernalillo County, and one lives in neighboring Sandoval County.

[Although not specifically stated, the serotype here is likely the d-tartrate-fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_ serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java). This organism has well-characterized animal reservoirs and has been involved in several recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail as noted below. It is not clear whether the New Mexico strain has been linked to the strain in Southern California reported in April 2015, and the Arizona cases reported this month (May 2015); see ProMED archive below.

The organism has been linked to human salmonellosis acquired from ornamental aquaria (Levings RS, Lightfoot D, Hall RM, et al. Aquariums as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B. Emerg Infect Dis. 2006; 12: 507-10 http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-1085.htm).

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. - Mod.LL
