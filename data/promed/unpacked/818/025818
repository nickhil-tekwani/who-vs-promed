Feds May Offer Vaccine to Some Exposed to Anthrax
---------------------------------------------
The U.S. government may offer anthrax vaccinations to some people
exposed to the biowarfare agent in mail attacks so they would not get
sick once they stop taking antibiotics, officials said on Saturday. People
exposed to high doses may still have potentially deadly anthrax spores
in their lungs after taking the recommended 60-day course of
antibiotics. As many as 3000 people are at the highest risk of having
lingering spores and might be candidates for an anthrax vaccine,
officials said.
The government's top experts said they would make a recommendation
early next week to Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and
Human Services, on whether to make the vaccine available to some
people who were exposed. [This was approved 18 Dec 2001; see

The vaccine, which Bioport Corp. makes for the U.S. military, is
approved for preventing anthrax before exposure. Giving it after
someone comes in contact with the biological warfare agent would be
done on an experimental basis only, with patients' informed consent,
officials said. The doses of the vaccine available to health officials have
not received Food and Drug Administration clearance for use, but one
top FDA official said they would be appropriate for an emergency,
stressing that patients would be informed of their status.
Alternatives to vaccination include advising people to watch for
symptoms and to keep in close touch with their doctors after their 60-
day course ends or extending antibiotic treatment to 90 days.
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention held a
meeting with anthrax experts in Washington on Saturday to discuss
data and evaluate options for preventing any new illnesses in people
who inhaled anthrax bacteria spores. Experts have little experience with
anthrax to guide their decisions.
About 10 000 people were urged to take the 60-day treatment because
they were exposed to anthrax through tainted letters sent to media
outlets and 2 US senators. Antibiotic therapy started as early as 8 Oct
2001, so many people have completed their courses. Others did not
start until 25 Nov 2001. No one who has finished the 60-day therapy
has developed anthrax, "an extremely reassuring piece of information,''
said Julie Gerberding, acting deputy director for the CDC's infectious
disease center.
One animal study showed giving a vaccine together with antibiotics
offered no benefit over giving antibiotics alone. [But this is because the
veterinary Sterne vaccine is a "live" vaccine derived from a culture that
is deficient in the pX02 plasmid. The Russians have successfully
explored the possibility of producing STI vaccines resistant to various
antibiotics that would be given simultaneously with the vaccine. The
STI vaccine is similar to the Sterne vaccine. - Mod.MHJ
Vaccines ... would be given in 3 injections at 2-week intervals.
Antibiotic therapy would continue until immunity built up at about 4
weeks after the first shot.
People who were in the room where an anthrax-tainted letter to Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle was opened have been urged to extend
antibiotic treatment to 90 days, said Dr. Gregory Martin, chief of
infectious diseases at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Some members of the military have alleged that the vaccine caused
chronic health problems. Health officials said on Saturday that the
vaccine had not been linked to any long-term side effects, but that
studies were continuing. The most common side effects are injection-
site reactions, such as swelling and tenderness.
The Defense Department is transferring 10 000 doses of the vaccine to
the Department of Health and Human Services and has offered to make
more doses available, said Dr. Kathy Zoon, head of the FDA's Center
for Biologics Research and Evaluation. The 10 000 doses are from a lot
that Bioport has made at a renovated plant that is awaiting regulatory
approval. Other doses could come from another batch of 209 000 made
in 1992. Preservative levels in those doses are lower than required for
regulatory approval, Zoon said, but she added that either batch would
be suitable for emergency use.

[If the USDA/APHIS or AVMA had recommended putting thousands
of cattle on cipro for 60 or 90 days, we would have been roundly
criticised by our physician brethren, and correctly so.
If these people were vaccinated now and the antibiotics discontinued
after a week, when the antibody system had begun to be primed [by the
vaccine -- or after 2 shots had been given, to be more cautious -- they
are then adequately protected against any late-germinating spores,
especially if they later get a third shot. The trials at USAMRIID many
years ago demonstrated the good protection provided by 2 or 3 shots of
the US human vaccine against massive exposures. Similarly, over time
the lungs clear out many if not all of the spores deposited there.
If I were to predict anything, it would be that in future similar
exposures, the putatively exposed people would be started promptly on
a vaccination series and simultaneously be given a limited but adequate
amount of a suitable oral antibiotic. - Mod.MHJ
