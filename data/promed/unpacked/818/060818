The territorial delegate to the Junta [provincial government] of Castile
and Leon in Zamora, Alberto Castro, said yesterday [9 Aug 2010] that the
cause of death of the up to now 79 red deer in the Sierra de la Culebra is
still unknown, but confirmed that it is an infectious disease that affects
exclusively red deer. Tests conducted last week [week of 2 Aug 2010] were
"inconclusive", but bluetongue and "common diseases" such as epizootic
haemorrhagic disease have been ruled out.

Of the 79 deaths recorded up to yesterday [9 Aug 2010], 36 were in the
Regional Game Reserve and 43 in 18 affected private reserves. The Junta has
used the protocols of the animal health laboratories in Leon and Algete
(Madrid) for the analysis of samples. It has also started collaboration
with the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Leon.

Castro justifies the slow pace of investigation because in the case of
diseases of wild animals, "this is not an exact science, with the added
constraint that when [the dead deer] are found they have been decomposing
for a long time." According to what he has been told by veterinarians,
"when a wild animal is sick, he/she hides in inaccessible areas, making the
task [of locating them] difficult. The vultures preying on them indicate
their location but they may not be found until several days later."

The Junta of Castile and Leon has all its resources working "100 per cent"
to search for the origin [of the disease] and to take action. "Samples
taken last week [week of 2 Aug 2010] have been negative but we will
intensify the search for high-quality samples from sick animals, and we
will comb the mountains."

The message to farmers is reassuring, "because the [dead] deer are being
found in higher areas of the mountain where farmers do not graze sheep or
goats. Bluetongue is a disease of concern, which might have spread to
domestic animals, but it has been ruled out [in this instance]." Finally,
authorities called for "responsibility and prudence to avoid speculation"
and said the results will be made public as soon as they become available
and that any person may request information from the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock.

Juan Francisco Marin, former dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of
Leon, said today [10 Aug 2010] that the deaths of red deer in the provinces
of Leon and especially Zamora could be due to the recurrence of an outbreak
of a bacterial infectious disease previously registered in Spain, in 1991,
in the Montes Universales on the border between Aragon and Castile-La
Mancha, as well as in other countries, such as the United States.

Although Marin said he has not directly examined any of the animals that
have died his hypothesis is based on known data and considers this could be
a "similar situation" to that caused by the infectious disease that appears
"especially in summer" and that affects mainly red deer, but also wild
ruminants and occasionally mouflon [a breed of sheep. - Mod.PC] He also
recalled the 1991 outbreak in the Montes Universales that caused a
mortality of more than 100 animals. [Marin] acknowledged that sometimes a
disease "takes time to diagnose", but emphasized that once [researchers]
are satisfied that it may be a particular disease, "a relatively accurate
diagnosis can be obtained in 3 days" without the need to carry out further
analyses.

According to Marin, in the cases recorded so far in Zamora and Leon and
based on published information, there are "several things that match" the
cases registered almost 2 decades ago, and at the same time he reported
that another 2 diseases, bluetongue and hemorrhagic disease of red deer
[epizootic haemorrhagic fever], have been ruled out.

The 1st cases of the "Bierzo virus" have already appeared in the province
of Leon, as confirmed on Monday [9 Aug 2010] by the mayor of the town of
Pozos, Avelino Fernandez, who stated that there have been "not less than 30
dead red deer" in his locality. Added to this number would be the "as many
that have appeared in the locality of Corporales." According to the mayor,
dead animals have also appeared in the villages of Manzaneda and Cunas de
Cabrera, but they have not been able to determine how many. Now the
residents of these villages fear a possible "pandemic" affecting the rest
of the livestock in the area.

For its part, the Junta [provincial government] has confirmed "6 dead deer
in the district of La Cabrera, Leon, on the border Zamora, which might have
died during the last week, and which are already in an advanced state of
decomposition. Thus, the 1st deaths recorded of these ungulates in the
Regional Game Reserve of Sierra de la Culebra and the region of La
Carballeda, now extend to the south west of the province of Leon.

Specifically, the Junta says, "a female was found dead without apparent
cause, or injury, in the locality of Pozos, and 2 more in Corporales.
According to information provided by private guards of the game reserves in
the locality of Morla, another female red deer died last week [week of 2
Aug 2010]. Similarly, in Nogarejas, very close to the border with Zamora,
another 2 females died. However, authorities are reassuring the population
and note that no other deaths have been reported in recent days."

Faced with this situation, environmental agents in the region and
neighboring areas have been instructed to be extremely vigilant in the
detection of dead or diseased specimens of that (red deer) or other
species. Also, veterinarians from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock
have performed autopsies and taken samples, which have been sent to the
Regional Animal Health Laboratory in Leon and the Spanish Animal Health
Reference Laboratory in Algete (Madrid), in the same way as was done for
the dead red deer in Zamora."

[Any undiagnosed die-off in a wild deer population is of concern. The
information contained in these 2 articles is sketchy at best and
ProMED-mail would appreciate a definitive diagnosis as soon as possible.
While there is a possibility that the cause of disease may end up to be
parasitic in nature, such a diagnosis cannot be made from a distance as one
article suggests and it is prudent to wait until necropsies are done on
viable samples. Good gross and histopathology are needed in this instance
and although they made be hard to obtain, at the rate these red deer are
dying, we might have definitive results soon.

We would like to thank our tireless correspondent Susan Baekeland for
finding an excellent reference detailing the previous Spanish experience
with _Elaeophoris schneideri_ infection in red deer, published in the
Journal of Wildlife Diseases in 2000. See
