It's official: the swine industry of this southern port city
[Zamboanga City] is free from the Ebola-Reston virus. Mayor Celso
Lobregat declared so, citing that tests were negative for porcine
reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), pseudo rabies virus
(PRV) and swine influenza virus (H1N1).

The test results that arrived this week were certified by the
Philippine Animal Center of the Bureau of Animal Industry, which also
conducted the tests on serum samples from dead swine sent by the
Office of the City Veterinarian here. The samples were taken from 12
pigs that died early this month [March 2009] in Vitali barangay [village] , 72
km east of this city. The situation caused undue alarm that it was an
outbreak of the Ebola-Reston virus. Lobregat disclosed that 5 of the
8 samples sent tested positive for classical swine fever, or hog
cholera, a highly contagious disease of pigs that usually results in
the death of the animal 15 days after it is infected.

He enjoined hog raisers to practice health management and husbandry
to prevent the spread of hog cholera, which could have a very bad
impact on the swine industry. He told hog raisers to submit their
pigs for regular vaccinations and de-worming and to keep pigpens and
their surroundings cool, dry and clean. He also asked them to feed
pigs with unspoiled food and clean water and report to the city
veterinarian any health problem in their animals. Similarly, the
mayor warned hog raisers not to slaughter and sell sick swine and
other livestock, as this may harm consumers and expose them to
diseases.

[A quick check of the OIE WAHID Interface
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php>
reveals that this disease is reported each year by the Philippine
government, but since 2005 without annual data. There were 1249
outbreaks in 2004, 3470 outbreaks in 2003, and "+" for each previous
year back to 1996. This is a readily controllable disease with a
long-proven successful vaccine, and many countries have eradicated it.
