An unidentified disease has killed 5 people and led to more than 100
being hospitalized over the past 2 weeks in the outskirts of the
Angolan capital Luanda, health officials said Saturday [3 Nov 2007].

"We don't know what it is at this stage", Luanda health official Vita
Vemba told state radio, while announcing the setting up of a special
commission comprising health, environment, and local government officials.

The independent financial daily A Capital on Saturday [3 Nov 2007]
blamed pollution in city's Cacuaco quarter for the rash of illnesses.
The director of the newspaper, Tandala Francisco, told AFP that 2
weeks ago, Cacuaco residents began complaining of a foul smelling
"green thick smoke" emanating from the chimney of a petroleum unit in
the area. The factory has since been closed.

Symptoms including "sleepiness, tiredness, and difficulty with
speech," witnesses told A Capital. Authorities meanwhile refused comment.

Vemba however dispelled fears of a cholera or fever outbreak.

Oil-rich Angola's sole refinery is located in Cacuaco.

An undiagnosed disease that has affected 200 and left at least 4 dead
in Cacuaco, about 20 km (12.5 mi) north of the Angolan capital,
Luanda, has health organizations scrambling to identify the illness.

The 1st cases were reported in early October [2007]. "What we know is
that new cases keep arriving at the hospital," Balbina Felix, disease
control officer at the World Health Organization (WHO) in Luanda, told IRIN.

According to the Municipal Hospital in Cacuaco, 20 new cases per day
have been reported since Monday [5 Nov 2007], with symptoms that
include weakness, drowsiness, muscular spasms, a confused state of
mind, dizziness, and difficulty to walk and speak. Approximately 208
000 people live in the coastal municipality.

Felix described the illness as a "clinical neurological disorder,"
and dismissed fever or cholera as possible culprits, but health
organizations are still in the dark. Identifying the disease has
become a priority, to help prevent further transmission and treat
fatally ill patients.

On Monday [5 Nov 2007], a delegation comprised of Health ministry
officials, Cacuaco municipal officials, and representatives of WHO,
the US-based Centre for Disease Control (CDC), and the Angolan
military health services visited affected areas.

Over 2700 Angolans succumbed to cholera in 2006, and the waterborne
disease has already killed over 400 people this year [2007]. In 2005
the country experienced the largest-ever recorded outbreak of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever, a rare but fatal disease caused by a virus from
the same family as the Ebola virus.

A WHO statement released on Tuesday [6 Nov 2007] said the
organization had deployed "an international team of experts in
clinical toxicology, epidemiology, and environmental health, as well
as laboratory personnel, to assist the Ministry of Health in the
ongoing investigation" and "experts from the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC), based in Luanda, have also offered support for the
investigation."

The teams would "support the Ministry of Health ... provide advice on
case- and risk-management, and identify laboratories for analysis of
human and environmental samples to investigate the cause and the
source of the disease". According to Felix, samples have already been
sent to the CDC in Atlanta, USA, and to testing facilities in France,
the UK, and Germany.

The Ministry of Health has advised the population to observe
individual and collective measures, particularly related to hygiene,
to avoid risk and report to the nearest health facility at the 1st
sign of illness.

International health officials are investigating the emergence of a
mysterious disease in Angola that has killed at least 4 people and
sickened more than 200.

The illness, which leads to weakness, muscular spasms, mental
confusion, and speech impairment, surfaced in Cacuaco, near Luanda,
in early October [2007], the World Health Organization (WHO) said in
a press release sent to Reuters late on Tuesday [6 Nov 2007].

It has since spread to 7 neighborhoods in the municipality, about 20
km (12.5 mi) north of the Angolan capital and home to some 200 000 people.

"As of 1 Nov 2007, more than 200 cases including 4 deaths have been
reported," the WHO said in its statement.

Experts from the WHO, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), and the Angolan government are investigating the outbreak.
"The Ministry of Health advised the population to observe the
individual and collective measures, especially food hygiene, to avoid
all risk factors related to solid wastes and to go to the nearest
health facilities if suffering from any signs of sickness," the WHO added.

Angola suffered an extensive cholera outbreak last year [2006] that
killed at least 1800 people. Some 150 Angolans died in 2004-2005
after contracting Marburg virus, a close relative of the feared Ebola virus.

The oil-rich southwestern African nation is struggling to rebuild its
health system, which was devastated during a 27-year civil war that
ended in 2002. Millions were left vulnerable to malnutrition and
other diseases due to the conflict. An estimated one-quarter of
babies and toddlers die before the age of 5.

Although former colonial power Portugal established a rudimentary
health system while ruling Angola, services crumbled after
independence in 1975.

[The symptoms described in each of these articles do not fit chlorine
gas or phosgene gas. Those gasses are most often associated with
'green smoke'. And indeed, the 'green smoke' may be nothing more than
a coincidence and have nothing to do with the actual illness.

There are some reports that the illness involves an abandoned case of
chloroquine whose expiration date is 2009. However, the symptoms do
not match a chloroquine overdose unless the chloroquine is tainted
with an as yet unknown toxin.

Samples from some victims have allegedly been sent to a couple of
laboratories but precisely what samples from the victims or the
environment have not been reported.

Clearly the situation remains a mystery. - Mod.TG
