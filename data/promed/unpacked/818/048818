Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Switzerland
----------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 31 Mar 2008 from Dr Heinzpeter
Schwermer, scientist, Monitoring, Swiss Federal Veterinary Office,
Liebefeld Berne, Switzerland

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (final report)
Start date: 22 Feb 2008
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 26 Mar 2008
Date submitted to OIE: 31 Mar 2008
Date event resolved: 1 Apr 2008
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: June 2006
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location and affected population
Luzern (Oberkirch, Oberkirch): 2 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_), one
common pochard (_Aythya ferina_), one mallard (_Anas platyrhynchos_) and 2
great cormorants (_Phalacrocorax carbo_) that were caught in a bird fyke
[net held open with hoops. - Mod.SH] on Lake Sempach.

These birds were sampled in the frame of the national programme for HPAI
and released after sampling.
The common pochard (_Aythya ferina_) that tested positive showed no
clinical signs of the disease at the time of sampling. The other birds
tested negative. Until now, there was no indication of the presence of
clinical infection in this region of Switzerland. This region can be
considered as one with the highest surveillance activity for avian
influenza virus in Switzerland. Since October 2007, 200 living birds have
been sampled and tested negative in that region.

Species: wild species
Susceptible 6
Cases 1
Deaths 0
Destroyed 0
Slaughtered 0

Outbreak statistics
Species Wild species
Apparent morbidity rate 17 per cent
Apparent mortality rate 0.00 per cent
Apparent case fatality rate 0.00 per cent
Proportion susceptible animals lost* 0.00 per cent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or
slaughter

Epidemiology: Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection. Unknown or
inconclusive.

Epidemiological comments: there was no evidence for a suspicion of HPAI at
the moment of sampling, as neither clinical signs nor an increase in
morbidity or mortality could be observed in the area (neither in wild birds
nor in backyard or farmed birds). Monitoring samples are typically analysed
in batches, explaining why the result was obtained only recently and
notified with a delay of about one month. The sequence determined (303 BP)
showed high homology to the viral sequences found in Eastern Europe in
2007. The obtained sequence at the hemagglutinin A cleavage site revealed
that the H5N1 strain detected was highly pathogenic, and the pathogenicity
index could not be determined.

In the past 5 weeks after sampling, no increased morbidity or mortality was
observed in wild or domestic birds in the area of Lake Sempach nor in other
regions of Switzerland. Proportionately to its wild bird population, Lake
Sempach is the best monitored water place in Switzerland, as it is the home
base of the Swiss Ornithological Station.

Nevertheless, measures were taken in line with the Swiss and European Union
legislation, and disease notification to the European Committee and to the
OIE was done, since the information about this isolated, random finding
might be of importance to the scientific community and to policy makers.

Laboratory name and type: Institut fur Viruskrankheiten und Immunprophylaxe

Test: polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test date: 26 Mar 2008
Result: positive

[This is an interesting case because the report emphasizes the observation
that there have been no clinical signs or excess morbidity or mortality as
one would expect in a previously non-infected area. If possible, since Lake
Sempach is the best monitored site in Switzerland, it would be useful to
know whether there was more than one wild bird which fell into this
subclinical but H5N1-positive status. If so, at what rate is this occurring
in different species living at the lake.

The location of the outbreak at Lake Sempach can be seen on the
