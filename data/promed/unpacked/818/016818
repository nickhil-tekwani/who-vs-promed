Wyoming State Veterinarian Dr. Jim Logan has been notified that cultures are positive for field strain _Brucella abortus_ (brucellosis) on a cow from one Park County cattle herd. Results were received on 19 Nov 2015 from the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie, Wyoming.

Dr. Logan, with the concurrence of USDA-APHIS, has designated the herd from which the reactor cow originated as "brucellosis affected" as of today [22 Nov 2015].

One cow that originated from a herd within Wyoming's Designated Surveillance Area (DSA) was positive to blood tests at the WSVL and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Specified cattle from the DSA are required to be tested within 30 days prior to change of ownership or movement from counties within the DSA. The herd was quarantined on 10 No 2015. It will remain under quarantine until the herd has undergone 3 consecutive, negative, whole-herd tests after any reactors have been removed from the herd.

Whole-herd testing was conducted on the "affected" herd on 15 Nov 2015, and no additional reactor animals were identified. There is one contact herd also under quarantine for herd testing. The contact herd could be released from quarantine if their herd test is negative.

The testing is being conducted as a cooperative effort between herd owners, Wyoming Livestock Board personnel, and private veterinary practitioners. Epidemiologic interviews with herd owners are ongoing, and quarantine herd plans will be developed with each herd owner associated with the case. Epidemiologic tracing will be conducted in the upcoming weeks by WLSB and APHIS personnel.

"Finding brucellosis in our DSA is not an unexpected event," said Logan. "We have a reservoir of brucellosis in wildlife in northwest Wyoming that occasionally will spill over into cattle. Our producers do a good job of mitigating their risks and trying to prevent brucellosis in their cattle herds. This situation illustrates the value and effectiveness of our surveillance program in Wyoming. We have found this case before the disease spread to other areas and are dealing with it appropriately. At this time, we do not have verification that this case has resulted from wildlife exposure. The epidemiological investigation will give us an answer with time. All of Wyoming's cases of brucellosis, from 2003 to 2011, have been verified as elk source exposure."

Logan said he expects to complete the initial stages of this response by the end of November [2015] with follow-up testing to occur in the ensuing months.

WLSB veterinary staff is also investigating a potential case of brucellosis in Sublette County, which is also in the DSA. Blood test results indicate there may be a positive herd. If this is an "affected herd," there will likely be additional contact/exposed herds that will need to be quarantined until tested.

[Wyoming has it challenges with wildlife, as it is part of the Greater Yellowstone area. Wyoming does a great job of managing this situation and staying on top of surveillance.

The only known focus of _Brucella abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock.

Elk, also known as wapiti (_Cervus canadensis_), are a reservoir of the disease, originally acquired from cattle. The elk are free to move in and out of the national park of Yellowstone. The elk feed at feeding grounds in the park. It is a tremendous tourist draw to see the large number of impressive animals. Some of these animals give birth to a calf at or near the feeding grounds. _Brucella abortus_, the organism responsible for the disease brucellosis, is often spread through the birthing process, fluids, and tissues. Other animals investigate the birthing site and probably become infected with the organism at that time. These same elk are free to move in and out of the park region, and thus may be spreading the disease to cattle they come into contact with in the area, thus, the article's statement of the likely source of the disease in the cow in question being elk.

In areas where a cow is found positive, the producers test their animals prior to moving them to market. This can be time consuming and is certainly an added cost to the producer.

The Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) is a portion of 3 states: Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. A map of the GYA showing the 3 states involved can be found at http://www.yellowstonegeotourism.org/. - Mod.TG
