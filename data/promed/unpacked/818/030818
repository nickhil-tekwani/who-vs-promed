Following the death of two people from leptospirosis, the Nicaraguan
government declared a state of emergency in the southern state of Rio San
Juan, which was hit by an unusually large number of rats. The urine from
domestic animals and rats is the main cause of leptospirosis in human
beings.
Eight years ago an epidemic of the disease, which is characterized by fever,
hepatitis with jaundice and bleeding, in the west of Nicaragua, left 37
people dead and 2000 more infected.
