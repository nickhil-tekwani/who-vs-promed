The history of the discovery of primary amebic meningoencephalitis
-------------------------------------------------
Re the statement that these ameba are freeliving in warm stagnant
water. These organisms are thermophiles. The water may or may not be
stagnant. There has been disease associated with natural thermal
pools in New Zealand and warmed domestic pipelines in Australia.
Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis was first recognised by a South
Australian pathologist. The histopathological appearances indicated
that the organism, _Naegleria fowleri_, entered the central nervous
system from the nasal cavity via the cribriform plate. But the mode
of transmission remained unknown. We hypothesised that pipeline water
supplying northern centres in South Australia was responsible for
transmitting thermophilic amebae during the summer months. The
evidence supporting our hypothesis was that domestic water pipelines
were exposed to sunlight and became heated to 35-45 degrees C in
summer, which promoted the formation of vegetative forms of the
amebae; some patients described using tap water to flush their nasal
cavities; and _Naegleri fowleri_ were eventually recovered from
domestic tap water supplies.

[The CDC has maintained surveillance of infections from water
supplies since 1971 and has recorded 6 cases of apparent _Naegleria
fowleri_ infections from drinking water all related to faulty water
supplies where backflow or backsiphonage had occurred. A case study
from Germany describes isolation of several species of free-living
amebae and bacteria from a newly constructed hospital (Michel R et
al. Intl J Hyg Environmental Med 1995,196:532-44) and studies of the
water supply of Strasbourg, France also showed that free-living
amebae were common (Derr-Harf C et al. Ann Parasit Hum Comp
1978,53:467-77). - Mod.EP]
