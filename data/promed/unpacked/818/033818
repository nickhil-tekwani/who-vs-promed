Malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, and other infections in India
--------------------------------------------------------------
Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar, black fever), confined to the
north and northeast of the country, has resulted in the deaths of 75
people, and 17 637 have been taken ill.

["The term 'leishmaniasis' includes 3 primary clinical syndromes: VL,
cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and mucosal leishmaniasis (1). In
visceral infections, leishmanial parasites replicate in the
reticuloendothelial system (e.g., spleen, liver, and bone marrow).
The infection can remain asymptomatic or subclinical or can become
clinically manifest, with an acute, subacute, or chronic course. In
the classic kala-azar syndrome of VL, patients have potentially
life-threatening disease, typically after an incubation period of
weeks to months, with fever, marked cachexia, hepatosplenomegaly,
pancytopenia, and hypergammaglobulinemia with hypoalbuminemia (1).

"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a sand fly--borne parasitic disease
also known as kala-azar (Hindi, for black sickness or fever), is a
risk for persons who travel to or live in areas of the tropics,
subtropics, and southern Europe where the disease is endemic (1). The
World Health Organization estimates that approximately 500 000 new
cases of this potentially fatal disease occur each year, greater than
90 percent of which are acquired in parts of the Indian subcontinent,
Sudan, and Brazil (1)." (Summary taken from MMWR article: Two Cases
of Visceral Leishmaniasis in U.S. Military Personnel -- Afghanistan,
2002-2004, MMWR 2 Apr 2004 / 53(12);265-268 available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5312a5.htm>. Reference 1
from the above information refers to Herwaldt BL. Leishmaniasis.
Lancet 1999;354:1191--9).

While the information provided about leishmaniasis in India in the
above newswire is very sparse, ProMED-mail has not encountered much
recent information on the status of visceral leishmaniasis in
India. The last report was in February 2008 and was a newswire about
7 suspected cases in Assam (see prior ProMED posting Leishmaniasis,
visceral - India: (Assam), susp., RFI 20080223.0736). A summary
document on the trends in reported incidence of kala-azar in India
during the period 1987 through 2006 is available at the WHO SouthEast
Regional Office (SEARO) website at
<http://www.searo.who.int/LinkFiles/Kala_azar_Trends_India.pdf>. In
2006 there were almost 35 000 reported cases with a case fatality
rate (CFR) of 0.5 percent. Cases were reported from 4 States: Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal. The statistics cited in
the above newswire brief suggest an almost 50 percent reduction in
reported cases since 2006, and a reduction in CFR to 0.42
percent. (Of note, according to the Global Infectious Disease and
Epidemiology Network (GIDEON, <http://www.gideononline.com>) in 2007
there were 22 751 reported cases with 101 fatalities (CFR 0.44
percent)). More information from knowledgeable sources on the
current status of visceral leishmaniasis in India with geographic
distribution of reported cases in 2008 would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
