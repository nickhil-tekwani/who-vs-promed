Cattle fever' epidemic hits Ilocos, other Luzon provinces
----------------------
TARLAC CITY: A deadly disease has afflicted cattle in Ilocos, and other
provinces in Luzon, Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) officials said. The
BAI said more than 700 head of cattle were found positive for ephemeral
fever in the Ilocos region and 216 head in Tarlac province, Dr. Lorna
Baculanta, provincial veterinarian said.
The signs of ephemeral fever are similar to hemorrhagic septicemia, a
dreaded disease also affecting cattle. They include stiff neck, lameness,
fever, drooling, and poor appetite, Baculanta explained.
As this developed, BAI Director Dr. Jose Molina has ordered continuous
collection of blood samples from cattle in Luzon where reported cases of
ephemeral fever are high. Ephemeral fever is called by a rhabdovirus.
But Baculanta said the BAI has successfully monitored the outbreak of the
cattle disease and prevented what could have been a major disaster in the
cattle industry in Luzon. "We have the support of Gov. Jose Yap and the
provincial government supplying free immunization to growers of affected
cattle," Baculanta said.
In Barangay Acocolao in Paniqui town alone, 75 head of cattle were found
positive for ephemeral fever. "The infected cattle, after they were given
medication, have recovered," Baculanta said, noting they showed signs of
recovery and they were immediately immunized against hemorrhagic septicemia.
There are 64 335 and 37 115 head of cattle and carabao [water buffalo,
respectively, in the province.

[Ephemeral fever is an arthropod-transmitted, noncontagious, viral disease
of cattle and water buffalo that occurs in Africa, Australia, and Asia,
except the former USSR. Inapparent infections occur in cape buffalo,
hartebeest, waterbuck, wildebeest, deer, and possibly goats.
Ephemeral fever virus is classified as a Rhabdovirus. The virus can be
transmitted from insect to susceptible cattle by intravenous inoculations.
Virus has been isolated from some _Culicoides_ spp and some mosquito
species. Transmission by contact or fomites does not occur, and the virus
does not appear to persist in recovered cattle. Most recovered cattle have
a life-long immunity.
Signs occur suddenly, vary in severity, and include a biphasic or
polyphasic fever, shivering, inappetence, lacrimation, serous nasal
discharge, drooling dyspnea, atony of forestomachs, depression, stiffness,
lameness, and a sudden decrease in milk yield.
Complete rest is the most effective treatment and recovered animals should
not be stressed or worked because relapse is likely. Anti-inflammatory
drugs given early and repeated doses for at least 3 days are effective. If
the swallowing reflex is functional, then oral dosing may be acceptable.
Attenuated virus vaccines appear to be effective but should be used only in
endemic areas. Inactivated virus vaccines have not produced long-term
protection against experimental challenge with virulent virus and cannot
guarantee
lasting immunity. - Mod.TG
