[Thus far in 2006,] a severe deterioration in the epidemiological
situation for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been
observed in the Southern Federal District of Russia. As of 8 Aug
2006, the Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer Rights and
Human Well-being reported that 192 cases of CCHF had been recorded in
the Southern Federal district. This figure exceeds that for the
corresponding period of [2005] by 43 percent.
The greatest deterioration has occurred in the Republic of Kalmykia
(65 cases of CCHF recorded) and in the Rostov region (53 cases of
CCHF). CCHF has been diagnosed in 40 patients in the Stavropol
region, in 15 patients in the Astrakhan area, in 16 patients in the
Volgograd area, and in 3 patients in the Republic of Dagestan.
So far in 2006, 5 patients have died as a consequence of CCHF virus
infection, compared with 4 fatalities in the corresponding period of
2005. Two fatal cases were recorded in the Republic of Kalmykia, and
one each in the Stavropol, Rostov and Astrakhan regions.
The majority of CCHF cases are contracted during the maintenance of
animals on private farms. Frequently ticks are removed by hand with
no protection of the skin of the farm-worker. Delay in seeking
medical attention often results in development of more severe forms of CCHF.
In the case of 4 patients in the Republic of Kalmykia, 2 in the
Stavropol region, 2 in the Astrakhan region and one in the Rostov
region, medial attention was not sought for 4 or more days after the
1st symptoms of CCHF infection.

[The Southern Federal District is one of 7 federal administrative
districts in Russia. It is located in the far southwest and includes
the Rostov, Krasnodar, Stavropol, Volgograd, and Astrakhan regions,
and the Republics of Chechnya, Kalmykia, Dagestan, Adygeya, Severhaya
Osetiya, Kabardino-Balkariya, Ingushetiya, and
Karachayevo-Cherkesiya. The Capital of the Southern Federal District
is Rostov-on-Don. - Mod.NP]
[Similar reports have been received from other parts of the Southern
Federal District: see for example, Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Russia
(South. Fed. Dist.) (03) 20060719.1985. It is likely that the higher
incidence of CCHF in 2006 reflects a greater density of the tick
vector throughout the Southern Federal District or is a consequence
of lack of attention to tick control procedures. A map of the
Administrative Units of the Russian Federation is available at:
