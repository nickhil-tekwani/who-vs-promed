Current status of cholera outbreaks in the Region
-------------------------------------------------
Cuba:
According to the latest information provided by the Cuba International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP), the total number of cases since epidemiological week (EW) 27 of 2012 through EW 34 of 2013 is 678, including 3 deaths. The cases were registered in the provinces of Camaguey, Granma, Guantanamo, Havana, and Santiago de Cuba, as well as in other towns associated with these provinces.

According to the information, the cases recorded in Havana in August 2013 have been linked to 2 food service centers where the presence of asymptomatic persons infected with cholera among food handlers was found. The food outlets have since adopted appropriate sanitary measures.

Among the confirmed cholera cases are 12 persons who had travelled to Cuba from other countries (2 from Chile, 2 from Germany, 3 from Italy, 2 from the Netherlands, 2 from Spain, and 2 from Venezuela). The cases include 8 men and 4 women, with an age range of 30-74 years (median age of 53).

Dominican Republic:
Since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 36 of 2013, the total number of suspected cholera cases reported was 30 973, of which 455 died. As with Haiti, from EW 1 to EW 9 of 2013, the number of suspected cholera cases and deaths recorded nationwide was higher than the number recorded for the same period of 2012. The increase has been linked to cholera outbreaks registered in some provinces and in the Altagracia prison. As of EW 10 of 2013, there had been a decrease in the number of suspected cases and deaths recorded; however, between EW 32 and EW 36, the suspected cases increased, in particular due to outbreaks in the provinces of La Altagracia, San Cristobal, Santiago and Maria Trinidad Sanchez. With regards to the case-fatality, for 2011 the case-fatality rate was 1.7 percent; at the end of 2012, it was 0.8 percent, and thus far in 2013, it has been 2.4 percent.

Haiti:
Since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) to EW 38 of 2013, the total number of cholera cases reached 678 840, of which 377 426 were hospitalized (55.5 percent), and 8289 died. The global case-fatality rate has been 1.2 percent since November 2011 with, however, variations between 4.3 percent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 percent, in Port-au-Prince.

Since EW 1 to EW 11 of 2013, the number of cases and deaths registered at a national level was greater than the respective numbers registered for the same period of 2012 due to outbreaks recorded in the departments of Artibonite, Centre, Grand Anse and Ouest. From EW 12 to EW 38 of 2013, the number of cases and deaths registered has been lower than what was registered for the same period in 2012.

Mexico:
The IHR NFP of Mexico reported 10 confirmed autochthonous cases of infection with _Vibrio cholerae_ O:1 Ogawa toxigenic; 2 in the Federal District and 8 in the state of Hidalgo. The cases are 6 women and 4 men with ages ranging from 2 to 73 years old. The onset dates range between 17 Aug and 17 Sep 2013. 5 cases were hospitalized and one died (61-year-old patient).

The Mexico health authorities are conducting various activities as part of the prevention and response to cholera, including strengthening epidemiological surveillance, strengthening the capacity and technical performance of the State Public Health Laboratory, and ensuring the availability of inputs and quality of care in medical units.
