On 21 Apr 2015, the Fairfield Medical Center (FMC) and Fairfield Department of Health contacted the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) about a patient suspected of having botulism in Fairfield County, Ohio. Botulism is a severe, potentially fatal neuroparalytic illness. A single case is a public health emergency, because it can signal an outbreak (1). Within 2 hours of health department notification, 4 more patients with similar clinical features arrived at FMC's emergency department. Later that afternoon, 1 patient died of respiratory failure shortly after arriving at the emergency department. All affected persons had eaten at the same widely attended church potluck meal on 19 Apr 2015. CDC's Strategic National Stockpile sent 50 doses of botulinum antitoxin to Ohio. FMC, the Fairfield Department of Health, ODH, and CDC rapidly responded to confirm the diagnosis, identify and treat additional patients, and determine the source.

A confirmed case of botulism was defined as clinically compatible illness in a person who ate food from the potluck meal and had 1) laboratory-confirmed botulism or 2) 2 or more signs of botulism or one sign and 2 or more symptoms of botulism. A probable case was a compatible illness that did not meet the confirmed case definition in a person who ate food from the potluck meal.

Among 77 persons who consumed potluck food, 25 (33 percent) met the confirmed case definition, and 4 (5 percent) met the probable case definition. The median age of patients was 64 years (range = 9-87 years); 17 (59 percent) were female. Among 26 (90 percent) patients who reported onset dates, illness began a median of 2 days after the potluck (range = 1-6 days). 27 of the 29 patients initially went to FMC. 22 (76 percent) patients were transferred from FMC to 6 hospitals in the Columbus metropolitan area approximately 30 miles away; these transfers required substantial and rapid coordination. 25 (86 percent) patients received botulinum antitoxin, and 11 (38 percent) required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation; no other patients died. Within 1 week of the 1st patient's arrival at the emergency department, 16 patients (55 percent) had been discharged. Among 19 cases that were laboratory-confirmed, serum and stool specimens were positive for botulinum neurotoxin type A or _Clostridium botulinum_ type A.

Interviews were conducted with 75 of 77 persons who ate any of the 52 potluck foods. Consumption of any potato salad (homemade or commercial) yielded the highest association with probable or confirmed case status (risk ratio [RR] = 13.9; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 4.6-41.8), followed by homemade potato salad (RR = 9.1; CI = 3.9-21.2). Of 12 food specimens collected from the church dumpster, 6 were positive for botulinum neurotoxin type A; 5 contained potato salad and one contained macaroni and cheese that might have been contaminated after being discarded.

The attendee who prepared the potato salad with home-canned potatoes reported using a boiling water canner, which does not kill _C. botulinum_ spores, rather than a pressure canner, which does eliminate spores (2). In addition, the potatoes were not heated after removal from the can, a step that can inactivate botulinum toxin. The combined evidence implicated potato salad prepared with improperly home-canned potatoes, a known vehicle for botulism (3).

This was the largest botulism outbreak in the USA in nearly 40 years (Table). Early recognition of the outbreak by an astute clinician and a rapid, coordinated response likely reduced illness severity and facilitated early hospital discharge. This outbreak response illustrates the benefits of coordination among responders during botulism outbreaks. Close adherence to established home-canning guidelines can prevent botulism and enable safe sharing of home-canned produce (2).

[Most USA botulism postings relate to the alert that a particular commercially prepared food was not adequately made which would increase a risk of intoxication with _C. botulinum toxin_. In most of these, no clear evidence of botulism is found in the food product. When botulism does occur related to food, it is most likely to be home-prepared. It should be noted that in typical foodborne botulism, the toxin is preformed in the food when ingested rather than disease being produced with ingestion of spores. Infant botulism (and its very rare adult equivalent, adult intestinal toxemia botulism) are caused by ingestion of spores, which germinate, and toxin is formed _in situ_.

Botulinum, the most toxic of known toxins, is produced by the Gram positive spore- forming anaerobic bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, found in soil worldwide. Botulism is caused by the consumption of contaminated products containing spores. Spores produce toxin when they germinate in the product or in the digestive tract. Humans are most often intoxicated by consumption of the preformed toxin in such things as home-canned vegetables or even baked potatoes left unrefrigerated. As little as 0.001 microgram per kilogram body weight may be lethal. The time from ingestion of the toxin until clinical signs are observed will vary with the amount of toxin ingested. The onset of clinical signs may be as short as a few hours but is seldom more than 24 hours. A very small amount of material containing the toxin can cause symptoms. Signs can develop rapidly and death can occur in a little as 6 hours after initial onset. Clinical signs may begin in human beings between 12-36 hours after ingestion of the toxin. The clinical signs and symptoms in human beings include ptosis, blurred vision, diplopia [double vision], dry mouth and throat, dysphagia, and dysphoria [feeling unwell]. These are a result of cranial nerve palsies. These early signs are followed by symmetrical descending flaccid paralysis, with generalized weakness and progression to respiratory failure. - Mod.LL
