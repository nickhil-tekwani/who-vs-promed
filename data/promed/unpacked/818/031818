Influenza Update Number 177
---------------------------
Summary
--------
- Influenza activity in North America remained high with some indications that activity might have peaked in areas. Some but not all indicators of severity in the United States of America and Canada have been slightly higher than in previous recent seasons. The onset of the season was earlier than usual and coincided with circulation of other respiratory viruses. Influenza A(H3N2) predominates in North America with A(H1N1)pdm09 being uncommon.
- Many countries in Europe and temperate Asia are reporting increasing influenza activity with A(H1N1)pdm09 being relatively more prominent in Europe than in North America.
- Some countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and the North Africa have reported declining detections of influenza positive samples. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 is predominant in the region.
- In tropical Asia, the influenza activity is similar to previous weeks, with persistent low-level circulation.
- Influenza activity in sub-Saharan Africa has declined in most countries
- In the Caribbean, Central America and tropical South America, influenza activity decreased to low levels, except for Bolivia, where there is increasing circulation of influenza A(H3N2)
- Influenza in countries of the southern hemisphere is currently at inter-seasonal levels

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
---------------------------------------------------
North America
Influenza activity in North America has seen a sharp increase since the beginning of December 2012 extending into 2013, which is earlier than expected. Some indicators of influenza activity are still elevated while others indicate that activity might have peaked. Influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rates which have been increasing since early December 2012 declined slightly in Canada during the 1st week in January. The ILI consultation rate decreased from 67.1/1000 patient visits at the time of the previous report, to 58.7 during the 1st week of January, with the highest rates observed in children of the 5-19 age group, followed by the <5 years. The percentage of samples that tested positive for influenza also decreased slightly from 34.5 percent in the end of December to 32.4 percent in the beginning of January. But an increasing number of regions (2 in AB, 2 in BC, one in MB, 3 in NL, 5 in ON, and 2 in QC) reported widespread influenza activity and the number of reported influenza outbreaks sharply increased in the 1st week of 2013. In the 1st week of January, 107 new influenza outbreaks were reported across the country, a markedly higher weekly number than any week of the previous 2 years. ILI consultations rates have also exceeded the 95 percent confidence intervals for 2 consecutive weeks in late December 2012. Of the 69 new laboratory confirmed influenza-associated paediatric hospitalizations, 55 percent were aged 0-2. In the 1st week of 2013, 298 laboratory confirmed influenza associated hospitalizations were reported, of which type and subtype information was available for 252. For these cases, 96.4 percent (243/252) were influenza A, of which, approximately 51.4 percent (125/243) were due to influenza A(H3N2) virus and 12.1 percent (5/243) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Just over half of these cases, 54 percent, (162/298) were aged over 65. Of the 138 cases with available data, 14.5 percent were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 14 deaths were reported in week 1 of January, all but one were above 65 years old. The one exception was in a case aged 0-4 years with influenza A.

Influenza A continued to dominate in Canada, with few detections of influenza B. Of the 3864 samples that were positive for influenza in the 1st week of January, 98.1 percent were positive for influenza A and 1.9 percent for influenza B viruses. Of the influenza A viruses that were sub-typed, 95.9 percent was A(H3N2) and 4.1 percent was A(H1N1)pdm09. Since the start of the season, the National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) has antigenically characterized 193 influenza viruses (143 A(H3N2), 25 A(H1N1)pdm09 , and 25 influenza B). The 143 influenza A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus A/Victoria/361/2011. The 25 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus A/California/07/09. Among the influenza B viruses, 21 were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus B/Wisconsin/01/2010 (Yamagata lineage) and 4 were similar to B/Brisbane/60/2008 (Victoria lineage; component of the 2011-2012 seasonal influenza vaccine). None of the viral samples tested against neuraminidase inhibitors oseltamivir (n=178) or zanamivir (n=176) were resistant.

Influenza activity in the US remained high, although there is some evidence that it might have peaked in some areas at the end of December. ILI consultation rates decreased to 4.3 percent which is still above the national baseline of 2.2%, with 32.8 percent of samples testing positive for influenza, down from 35.2 in the last week of December and the 3rd consecutive week of decline. Almost all states (47) reported widespread influenza activity. The proportion of all deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) reported through the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System slightly exceeded the national threshold of 7.2 percent (the upper 90 percent confidence interval for the previous 10 seasons) for the 1st time in recent weeks but has generally been mid-range for most of the season. 2 influenza-associated pediatric deaths were reported the last week of December, bringing the total for the season so far to 20 (34 pediatric deaths were reported during the 2011-12 influenza season). Both deaths were associated with influenza A, one of which was sub-typed as A(H3N2) virus. Between 1 Oct 2012 and 5 Jan 2013, 3710 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations were reported, a rate of 13.3 per 100 000 population. In comparison, the end of season cumulative rate of hospitalization in 2011-12 season, a relatively mild season, was 8.6 and 21.4 in 2010-11. The highest rates of hospitalization (53.4 per 100 000) were reported in individuals over 65 years of age followed by the 0-4 years (22.4 per 100 000). Among all hospitalizations, 86.2 percent (3198/3710) were associated with influenza A and 13.0 percent (484/3170) with influenza B virus. Among hospitalizations with influenza A subtype information, 98.7 percent (767/777) were attributed to A(H3N2) and 1.3 percent (10/777) were attributed to A(H1N1)pdm09.

In the US, the majority of influenza positive samples were due to influenza A(H3N2), however influenza B accounted for a larger proportion of cases than in Canada. Of the 4222 samples that were positive for influenza virus in the 1st week of January, 80 percent were influenza A and 20 percent were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses with sub-type information, 98 percent were A(H3N2). Since 1 Oct 2012, the CDC has antigenically characterized 521 influenza viruses. All 17 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested were characterized as A/California/7/2009-like and 99.4 percent of the 327 A(H3N2) influenza viruses tested were A/Victoria/361/2011-like. Of the 177 influenza B viruses characterized 66.7 percent were B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like of the Yamagata lineage, a component of this seasons trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine, and 33.3 percent were of the Victoria lineage. Since 1 Oct 2012, none of the 600 A(H3N2), 70 A(H1N1)pdm09 (48 for zanamivir), or 230 B viruses have been resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors. However, rare sporadic cases of oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses have been detected worldwide. Additional information is available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/antivirals/index.htm

In Mexico, influenza activity gradually increased. Up to end of December 2012, the percentage of health service visits for ILI and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) had remained below 1 percent. However, positive rates for influenza have been between 20 and 40 percent in the recent weeks. At the national level, the endemic channel for SARI remained just above the 50th percentile. At the end of December, influenza B was the predominant virus detected, followed by influenza A(H3N2) and there were no infections with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09.

Europe
Influenza activity in Europe continued to increase especially in the northern and western part of the continent. The proportion of specimens testing positive for influenza increased to approximately 37 percent from 23 percent at the last WHO update due mainly to an increase in influenza A viruses. The distribution of viruses types and subtypes across Europe was notably different from that observed in North America. Since the beginning of the season in October 2012, influenza viruses typed from sentinel and non- sentinel sources had been distributed as about 65 percent influenza A and 35 percent influenza B. The proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 versus A(H3N2) is higher than in North America and has increased from the last update to 81 percent vs. 19 percent for A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) respectively.

Among individual countries in the region, increasing numbers were reported by approximately 16 countries compared to only 9 in week 52/2012, and medium to high intensity was reported by 12 countries compared to only 4 in the previous weeks. Norway in particular was the only country to report high intensity and the number of both ILI and influenza positive cases increased to a season- high in the 1st week of the year. Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Slovakia, and Sweden all reported medium intensity for the 1st time this influenza season, while France and Italy have reported the same trend for the last 3 weeks.

Influenza detections among SARI cases have been sporadic over the past few weeks and SARI hospitalizations have remained stable with most cases being reported in children aged 0-4 years.

As reported previously, 90 percent of the 85 antigenically tested viruses since the beginning of the season corresponded with the viruses recommended by the WHO for inclusion in the current Northern Hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. None of the 81 viruses tested for susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) were found to be resistant.

Northern Africa and the eastern Mediterranean region
Influenza activity had been increasing in the previous weeks, however, more recently, the number of specimens testing positive for influenza has slowly been declining. The proportion of specimens positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus has been increasing in the region, and now appears to be the dominant sub-type, accounting for the majority of influenza positive samples, Exceptions were Algeria and Pakistan, where influenza B was the most common, and Egypt, which was predominantly A(H3N2) virus.

Temperate Asia
Influenza activity increased throughout most of the temperate region of Asia. ILI activity has increased for the 7th consecutive week in northern China. The proportion of outpatient visits at sentinel surveillance sites that were due to ILI increased to 4.2 percent compared to 3.9 percent in the previous report. Influenza A accounted for 99 percent (101/102) influenza viruses detected; only one sample was positive for influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses that were sub-typed, 60 percent were A(H3N2) and 40 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09. This is in contrast to the previous report, where influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 accounted for one-5th of sub-typed influenza A viruses. China officially announced the start of their influenza season in the north last December [2012]. Among influenza viruses antigenically characterized by the Chinese National Influenza Center since October 2012, 37 (97.4 percent) influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were A/California/7/2009-like, 256 (100 percent) influenza A(H3N2) viruses were A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like; 112 (96.6 percent) influenza B/Victoria viruses were B/Brisbane/60/2008- like and 7 (100 percent) influenza B/Yamagata viruses were B/Wisconsin/01/2010-like. None of the influenza samples tested were resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir.

In Mongolia, ILI activity decreased compared to the rising trend of the previous weeks, although this could be as a result of the New Year holiday period. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most common virus sub-type detected. Much of ILI in recent weeks was associated with other respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus and human coronaviruses.

Influenza activity was increasing in both Japan and the Republic of Korea, with detections of mainly influenza A(H3N2) in Japan, and A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 in the Republic of Korea.

Countries in the tropical zone
-------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas
In both Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity in week 01/2013 was similar or declined compared to previous weeks and continuously decreased from their peaks in late summer. The dominant virus subtypes were A(H3N2) and B, with Cuba being the only exception, where A(H1N1)pdm09 was observed.

Throughout South America, influenza activity declined in the 1st week of the year with the exception of Paraguay and Bolivia, which experienced slight increases. Paraguay reported circulation of both A(H3N2) and influenza B, while Bolivia, reported a moderate increase in circulation of A(H3N2) only.

Sub-Saharan Africa
Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa experienced decreasing detections of influenza. The influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus that had been circulating previously in Ghana has now subsided to inter-seasonal levels. Cameroon, Madagascar, and Zambia also reported low level detections of influenza B.

Tropical Asia
Influenza activity in most countries of south east Asia remained similar to previous weeks, with continuing low-level circulation. Influenza activity in India was at inter-seasonal levels, with low detections of mainly influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and some influenza B viruses.

In Sri Lanka, influenza continued to circulate at similar levels to previous weeks, however, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 which had been detected previously, was declining, resulting in A(H3N2) and influenza B to be the most commonly detected virus sub-types. Influenza A(H3N2) and some influenza B viruses were also detected in Cambodia and Thailand.

Atypical of the region, but similar to previous weeks, Viet Nam reported declining detections of predominantly influenza B, while Lao PDR had co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses.

Influenza activity in Singapore and southern China, including Hong Kong SAR, remained below seasonal thresholds, although it had reached a national warning level in Singapore, and was increasing in southern China, where 56 of 1089 (5.1 percent) specimens were positive for influenza: 46 (82 percent) influenza A and 10 (18 percent) influenza B (lineage not determined). Of the influenza A sub-typed viruses, 82 percent were A(H3N2) and 18 percent were A(H1N1)pdm09.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
---------------------------------------------------
Influenza activity in all temperate countries of the southern hemisphere is now at inter-seasonal levels.

[The EuroFlu bulletin for week 2/2013 (http://www.euroflu.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi) stated the following. "Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) are now increasing in almost all countries in the Region. However, influenza activity is still largely limited to the western part of the Region, where widespread transmission is being reported by most countries currently. While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and type B viruses are circulating in the Region, the proportion of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 continues to increase, relative to influenza B and A(H3N2), and accounts for 84 percent of influenza A viruses subtyped. The number of reported hospitalizations due to severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) is increasing slowly along with a rising proportion of patients testing positive for influenza."

There are marked differences in the frequencies of the influenza virus types prevalent in different regions of the world. Overall the viruses in circulation globally are well-matched by the current vaccine virus strains, and no novel influenza viruses have made their appearance. There is some evidence that the consequences of influenza virus infection may be more severe than in previous years in some regions, but not overall. - Mod.CP.]
