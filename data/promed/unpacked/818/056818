Denmark set off alarm bells this week with its announcement that it is culling the nation's entire mink herd -- the largest in the world -- to stop spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the prized fur species because of potentially dangerous mutations.

Inter-species jumps of viruses make scientists nervous -- as do suggestions of potentially significant mutations that result from those jumps. In this case, Danish authorities say they've found some genetic changes that might undermine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines currently in development.

But is this latest twist in the COVID-19 saga reason to be deeply concerned? Several experts STAT consulted suggested the answer to that question is probably not.

"This hits all the scary buttons," noted Carl Bergstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Washington. But Bergstrom and others argued that while the virus's penchant for infecting mink bears watching, it isn't likely to lead to a nightmare strain that is more effective at infecting people than the current human virus.

"I don't believe that a strain which gets adapted to mink poses a higher risk to humans," said Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute. "We can never rule out anything, but in principle it shouldn't. It should definitely not increase transmission. I don't see any good reason why it should make the virus more severe," he said.

Let's take a look at what's known about the Danish situation, why inter-species jumps make scientists nervous, whether the mutations are likely to affect vaccine effectiveness, and why Balloux thinks this situation is "fantastically interesting."

Denmark is the world's largest producer of mink -- by some estimates 40%. Unfortunately, mink are susceptible to the SARS-2 virus, a fact that came to light in April [2020] when the Netherlands reported outbreaks on mink farms there. Infected humans who work in the farms transmit the virus to captive minks, which are housed in close quarters ideal for rapid transmission from mink to mink.

Occasionally, mink infect people -- a phenomenon recorded in both the Netherlands and Denmark. In a statement, the Danish Ministry of Environment and Food said the country would cull its entire herd -- estimated to be about 17 million animals -- after finding mutations in the viruses from the mink that it believes would allow those viruses to evade the immune protection generated by COVID-19 vaccines.

Experts outside the country are not clear what that claim is based on. While there has been some information released about the mutations that have been recorded, it isn't yet enough to support such a bold claim, said Marion Koopmans, head of virology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, where a lot of the analyses from viruses from the Dutch mink outbreaks have been conducted.

"That is a very big statement," said Koopmans. "A single mutation, I would not expect to have that dramatic an effect."

Outside experts haven't had genetic sequencing data to peruse, said Emma Hodcroft, a molecular epidemiologist at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Bern, Switzerland. But Denmark uploaded 500 genetic sequences into databases open to scientists around the globe on Thursday [5 Nov 2020] and is expected to add hundreds more in the days to come.

Experts will pore over those sequences looking for what the Danes saw and to try to determine what impact these mutations may have if viruses containing them infect people.

For now, however, Hodcroft agrees with Koopmans. "It's almost never the case that it's such a simple story of one mutation and all your vaccines stop working."

She, frankly, is more concerned with how the announcement was handled than about the findings themselves. "It puts scientists and the public in a really difficult position when we have statements like this out there for which we have very little information or context," Hodcroft said. "These things are essentially never black and white."

Species jumps always make scientists nervous. One such event, after all, is how we ended up with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Viruses that typically infect one kind of animal -- let's use bats as an example -- that find their way into another species can trigger severe illness in the new species if the virus is able to transmit efficiently. Viruses can become entrenched -- endemic -- in the new species.

It's thought, for instance, that the 4 coronaviruses -- cousins of SARS-2 -- that cause common colds spilled over from other species into humans at some point in the past. Flu virus spillover events -- from poultry or from pigs -- occur from time to time. The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was triggered when a flu virus that had been circulating in pigs started infecting people.

After years of coping with viral spillovers like Ebola outbreaks, flu pandemics plus the earlier coronavirus jumps like the 2003 SARS outbreak, people are primed to be worried about these events, Bergstrom said.

But this is a different situation, he said. It's not a virus unknown to humans that has jumped from an animal species. In this case, a virus that has already adapted to spreading among people jumped to minks and is now occasionally jumping back.

Bergstrom thinks it's prudent of the Danish government to cull the mink herd. But he's not sure the changes that have occurred in the mink are likely to make the virus worse for people.

"We're used to being scared before a pandemic when something from a distant species comes into a nearer species. And our intuitions aren't quite right for what happens in the middle of a pandemic when something goes from us into a distant species and then comes back," he said.

Balloux and others suggested the changes seen in the mink viruses may be a sign of the virus adapting to infect minks -- which might make the viruses less effective in people over time. Balloux pegs the risk the spillover poses to humans as being "really, really small." But he said it is exceptional to actually be able to capture in real time what happens when a spillover happens and chart the genetic changes from the start.

Typically when such events occur, humans only recognize what's going on when a virus has adapted to spread in people. For example, the early changes that made SARS-2 capable of transmitting from a still unknown animal species to people were never observed.

"It's completely exceptional," Balloux said. "We are always [too] late."

(An earlier version of this story stated that Denmark produces 28% of the world's mink supply. In fact, estimates vary.)

Yesterday [4 Nov 2020], Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced that all mink in Denmark must be killed.

The reason is that infection among mink farms is increasing in number and geographical spread, without the preventive measures having worked. People in areas with infected mink farms have been infected from the mink. New mink variants of COVID-19 have been seen, which show reduced sensitivity to antibodies from several people with a history of COVID-19 infection. This is serious, as it may mean that a future COVID-19 vaccine will be less effective against infection with these variants.

Background: On 6 Nov 2020, COVID-19 infection was registered in Denmark on 216 mink farms. This development has taken place despite intensive efforts by the authorities to limit the infection.

At the same time, new mink variants of COVID-19 virus have been found in humans. This applies both to people who work with mink and to the local population. There has also been a strong geographical and temporal connection between the number of positive mink farms and the incidence of infection among people in the North Jutland Region.

Mink variants occur when there are small changes in virus genetic material (mutations). These occur continuously in connection with the virus copying itself. The more viruses that are copied, the greater the likelihood of mutations occurring.

It is well known that virus mutations can occur especially when viruses jump from one species to another, for example from humans to mink, and from mink to humans. This happens when the virus adapts to the new species. Viruses can also mutate when transmitted between many individuals. It can be, for example, at an animal market or in a large mink farm. This results in a large virus reservoir and different virus variants.

A virus's genetic material, and thus any mutations, can be detected by whole genome sequencing (WGS). So far, 5 different groups or clusters of mink variants have been found in Denmark (clusters 1-5).

Among these mink variants, 7 different mutations have been seen in the so-called spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus. And there are examples of up to 4 different changes in the spike protein in the same virus.

The spike protein is essential, as it is the protein that viruses use to penetrate a cell. Following a natural infection, humans develop antibodies to the spike protein. The potential COVID-19 vaccine candidates are also based on this important protein. Therefore, there is a risk that the effect of spike-based anti-COVID-19 vaccines may be affected when there are changes in the spike protein on the viruses that the vaccine is to fight.

A specific virus from cluster 5 has been detected with 4 simultaneous changes in the genes for the spike protein in 5 North Jutland mink farms and in 12 patient samples. Of these, 4 people were directly connected to 3 of these farms.

To those skilled in the art, SSI can report that the spike protein of the viruses has the following changes in amino acids: H69del/V70del, Y453F, I692V and M1229I. Information on all variants will be uploaded in the international system GISAID.

Preliminary studies suggest that this virus from cluster 5 exhibits decreased susceptibility to antibodies from more individuals with past infection compared with non-mutated virus. This has been demonstrated in laboratory experiments, where it is seen that the particular mink virus [cluster 5] is not inhibited to the same degree by antibodies from humans who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 compared with other non-mutated SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Studies are currently underway that will further uncover the issue.

This finding is worrying, as it could potentially have an impact on the future of COVID-19 vaccine against infection with this and other new mink variants. It may also pose a risk of impaired immunity to these following COVID-19 infection. It is important both for the individual and for the possibility of reinfections with mutants.

Viruses from cluster 1 have also been examined using the same method, but no evidence of reduced susceptibility to antibodies was found. The other variants (clusters 2-4) are also being tested for sensitivity. However, these studies take time (weeks), as viruses need to be cultured first.

In Denmark, mink variants of the virus have been detected in 214 people among 5102 samples that have been completely sequenced from week 24 to week 42. This is the period when there has been an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 among mink.

During this period, a total of 37 967 infections have been detected, so that the proportion of sequenced samples is 13%. Out of the 214, these mink variants have been found in 200 people in the North Jutland region (94%). During this period, 535 samples have been sequenced in North Jutland. This means that mink variants have been detected in 40% of the samples. In addition, 14 people have been infected with these mink variants outside North Jutland, where 4568 samples were sequenced during the period, corresponding to 0.3% of the samples.

Cluster 5 virus was found on 5 mink farms and in 12 [human?] samples in August and September [2020]. Of these [12], 11 are from North Jutland and 1 person on Zealand.

Overall, this suggests that infection with mink variants is so far primarily a problem in North Jutland closer to the infected farms.

SSI has for a long time expressed concern about the mutations that occur in the spike protein. However, concerns that there may be decreased susceptibility to antibodies from vaccines were of a theoretical nature. This concern has now become real after the trials that SSI first had results of on Monday [2 Nov 2020].

Therefore, SSI sent a new risk assessment to the Ministry of Health on 3 Nov 2020. SSI estimated that continued mink breeding would entail a significant risk of recurrence of a large spread of infection among mink and humans, as seen in Western Denmark in 2020.

SSI estimated that this would pose a major risk to public health. Both know that the many infected mink farms can lead to a greater disease burden among humans and that a large virus reservoir in mink increases the risk of new virus mutations occurring again, which vaccines may not provide optimal protection against.

Overall, the immunity gained through vaccination or past infection may also be at risk of being weakened or absent.

The overall conclusion, which was also supported by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority, was therefore that continued mink breeding during an ongoing COVID-19 epidemic entails a significant risk to public health. This includes the possibilities for optimally preventing COVID-19 with vaccines.

As a citizen, you do not have to worry. The mutated virus is no more dangerous than other viruses or more contagious. However, if it spreads in Denmark or internationally, it could potentially have serious consequences for the protective effect of future vaccines. The best way to get rid of this variant is generally to slow down the spread of infection. This is especially true in North Jutland, where the mink variants are most widespread, but also others in the rest of the country.

[The STAT article (section 1, above) reports that Denmark uploaded 500 new sequences from SARS-CoV-2 last night (5 Nov 2020), which will give scientists and public health people a new source to understand how the mink-human interaction causes evolution of the virus.

The news release from Statens Serum Institute (SSI; section 2) reports the amino acid changes in the spike protein found in the cluster 5 variant were associated with a decreased susceptibility to antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 in humans after infection.

As the vaccines under development will at present not include a protein that includes the mutations seen in SARS-CoV-2 cluster 5, they will induce only a partial immunity. This is equivalent to an influenza vaccine with a poor fit to the seasonal outbreak influenza virus.

At present 12 persons are known to be infected with cluster 5 SARS-CoV-2 variant, and all were identified in August and September 2020.

The Danish authorities have closed 7 municipalities in northern Jutland with the most infected mink farms and most humans with mink-associated COVID-19. It is important to emphasize that so far the mink clusters do not induce a more severe disease in humans.

The reduced susceptibility to reconvalescent sera in SARS-CoV-2 cluster 5 virus is the reason the Danish government decided to cull all mink in the country. - Mod.EP
