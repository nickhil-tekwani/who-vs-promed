[The posting above presented a media-published article by Dr Joseph Mugachia, DVM, which included the following message: "The illness (heartwater) is also called Ondiri disease because the 1st case in Kenya was diagnosed around the Ondiri swamp in Kikuyu."

We are grateful to Dr Keith Sumption for the following corrective response. - Mod.AS].

It must be pointed out that Ondiri disease, and heartwater, are not the same, even if the agents concerned are related.

Ondiri fever, or bovine petechial fever, is an ehrlichiosis with a completely different distribution pattern in Kenya, restricted to cool high altitude locations where cattle and the wild host (antelope, bushbuck) share common grazing. The Ondiri swamp where it was 1st discovered is close to the Vet Labs in Kabete. The vector (in my view probably _Ixodes lewisi_) is only associated with these high altitude forests and as the forests have been cleared over the past 30 years, so the disease has disappeared. The ehrlichia sp is probably very closely related to Anaplasma (_A. phagocytohila_) on grounds of the host leucocyte preference and morphology. Its presence in Kenya probably relates to the presence of _Ixodes_ ticks in high latitude, cool locations, with some climatic similarity to parts of Europe, which may have been a source millenia ago for the colonization.

Heartwater, on the other hand, is transmitted by _Amblyomma_ ticks, usually in altitudes less than 1600 meters [approx. 1 mi] above sea level, down to the semi-arid rangelands. Infection involves endothelial cells, not phagocytes.

While Ondiri fever appears extinct (but probably lives on where bushbuck live in the high forests), I am happy to know vets in Kenya at least recall the name, if not the history and differences to heartwater.

[During the 70's of the 20th C., several papers addressing bovine petechial fever (Ondirfi disease) were authored by researchers of the Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Nairobi and the Veterinary Research Laboratory, Kabete, Kenya. (Ref. 1,2).

The following is the abstract of ref 1, addressing the morphology of the causal agent of Ondiri disease.

Abstract
"A study has been made of the agent of bovine petechial fever, which is primarily a parasite of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Distinct morphological forms were observed by light and electron microscopy. They were identical in field cases of the disease, in early bovine passage material, in experimental sheep and in cattle receiving infective sheep blood to reproduce the condition. Maturation into giant bodies and groups of mixed types appeared to be more common during the early stages of the disease, whereas the morula type with small bodies predominated later. The organisms divided by binary fission and by condensation within a large body to produce a small body.

"Extrusion of small and large bodies, and some apparent phagocytic activity against the parasite, were observed in the infected cells.

"It is suggested that the agent be placed tentatively in the genus _Cytoecetes_ proposed by Tyzzer (1938), within the tribe _Ehrlichieae_, together with the causal agent of tick-borne fever, the "equine ehrlichia" agent and Tyzzer's vole organism".
