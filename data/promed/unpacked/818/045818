DROUGHT EFFECTS, LIVESTOCK - USA (TEXAS)
****************************************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

[I put a request out on the Texas veterinary net for their clinical
observations on the present severe heat and drought afflicting Texas and
Louisiana livestock. This was a reply. - Mod.MHJ]

From: Fort Davis Veterinary Services <wtxvets@overland.net>
Results of drought on cattle here:
[1] direct starvation death loss of cows, and other classes;
[2] weed intoxication and sequelae - death, infertility, abortion;
[3] thin cow syndrome/permanent loss of fertility/inability to feed
calf/abortion;
[4] increased susceptibility to infectious diseases (e.g. respiratory,
anaplasmosis)
[5] others: (a) permanent damage to pastures; (b) loss of genetics due to
forced sale.

[Comments that I have received from others include the potential for
increased incidence of aflatoxin poisoning because of the poor quality of
the corn (maize) crop; wide spread extensive feeding of hay; reduction of
milk production by 25% in spite of addition feeding; general increased
number of incidents of retained placentae, mastitis, ephemeral fevers, and
general poor doing; and it is a classic scenario for anthrax outbreaks.
Other comments are welcomed. - Mod.MHJ]
