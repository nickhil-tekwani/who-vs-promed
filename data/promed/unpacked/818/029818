No CWD found in Arizona deer and elk testing
--------------------------------------------
The Arizona Game and Fish Department reports lab tests found no
detection of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in any of the 2343
testable samples from hunter-harvested or road-killed deer and elk
during Arizona's 2008-09 hunting season. The department has tested
approximately 12 500 deer and elk samples since beginning its
surveillance program in 1998. None have tested positive for the
disease. Although CWD has not yet been found in Arizona, it is
present in 3 neighboring states: Utah, Colorado and New Mexico.

"We nearly doubled our surveillance and collection of samples in
areas of concern where neighboring states have detected CWD, which
makes announcing another season with no detection in Arizona very
encouraging," said Clint Luedtke, interim wildlife health specialist
for the department. "However, we are going to continue to focus
heavily in areas that border Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico during
the 2009-10 season." Another improvement to the surveillance effort
this year includes a professional cooperation with the Navajo Nation
Department of Fish and Wildlife. The samples they collected were also
included for testing. All of those samples came back negative.

As in past hunting seasons, Game and Fish will be asking for hunters'
assistance this season in submitting deer or elk heads for free CWD
testing. Heads can be brought to any Game and Fish Department office
between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Luedtke added,
"Arizona's hunters, meat processors and taxidermists continue to play
a crucial role in our surveillance program, and we cannot thank them
enough in assisting this effort." Hunters who are successful in Game
Management Units 12B and 27 are especially encouraged to submit heads
for sampling because these units border states that have positively
detected CWD. Deer and elk from these areas of the state have the
greatest potential for initial detection of CWD. Additionally,
because the Kaibab check station is only mandatory for Units 12AE and
12AW, it is typically more difficult to obtain samples from Unit 12B.

The department has had rules in place since 2002 banning the
importation of cervids designated as restricted live wildlife under
commission rule R12-4-406(A)(9)(b), to protect against the
introduction of CWD to free-ranging or captive wildlife.

[So far Arizona is managing to stay free of CWD, which is a comfort
as this disease pops up in new places elsewhere. We should not forget
that it lurks in an area east of El Paso in North-West Texas on the
New Mexico/Texas border. - Mod.MHJ]
