The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (10 May 2015) received notification of 4 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) with onset of symptoms between 27 Mar 2015 and 12 Apr 2015 from the National Health and Family Planning Commission, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

The patients comprise 2 men and 2 women aged 5 to 67, and 2 of them (1 man and 1 woman) died. 2 cases are from Zhejiang: 1 is from Fujian and 1 is from Jiangsu.

Since 2013, 640 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities. Regarding the 3rd wave in the Mainland since November 2014, a total of 200 cases have been reported, including 72 in Guangdong, 40 in Fujian, 40 in Zhejiang, 18 in Jiangsu, 8 in Anhui, 7 in Xinjiang, 6 in Shanghai, 3 in Jiangxi, 2 in Hunan, 2 in Shandong, 1 in Guizhou and 1 in Hubei.

[FluTrackers' case count since the beginning of recognized activity in Mainland China in 2013 remains 660 (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links).

The Editor-in-Chief of FluTrackers, Sharon Sanders, has not added these newly reported cases to her list because she thinks at least 3 of the 4 listed have already been posted in her tally. The Jiangsu case may be new or may be case #646, residing in Jiangsu but hospitalized in Shanghai. Because the announcement made above has no detail and encompasses 2 months, it is difficult to judge. The April 2014 month-end provincial reports, which include Jiangsu, may help clarify the exact number of cases.

This current announcement brings 2015's 'official' total to 200 cases -- considerably more than the 1st wave of 2013 (n=133), but less than the 2nd wave (n=303), if the 3rd wave numbers are accurate. The number of cases of H7N9 being reported has decreased considerably since the beginning of the 3rd wave in November 2014 -- not surprising since H7N9 demonstrates seasonal activity.
