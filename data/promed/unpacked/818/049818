Indonesia: emergency declared following 44 rabies deaths
-----------------------------------------------
The government of Lembata regency declared an emergency situation on
Thu 3 Feb 2005, after 44 people died in the past week [1st week of
February 2005] due to rabies.
The latest victim was a 7-year-old, who died on Thu 5 Feb 2005 after
being bitten by a rabid dog.
In order to control the outbreak, since Sunday [6 Feb 2005], the
government has shot dead 212 dogs suspected of having the virus and
is now hunting down more, said Maria Geong, the Head of the Animal
Husbandry Office at the Lembata administration. The government will
also vaccinate the remaining healthy dogs in the regency, Geong said.

[The number of deaths in this outbreak in such a short period of time
is exceptional and demands exceptional measures, firstly to make
available adequate amounts of vaccine and immune globulin for
post-exposure treatment of the victims of dog-bite, and, secondly,
for immediate control of the feral dog population by destruction and
by vaccination of domestic dogs. - Mod.CP]
