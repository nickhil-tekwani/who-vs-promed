Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update 17 Jul 2014
------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) continues monitoring the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. New cases and deaths attributed to EVD continue to be reported from the 3 countries.

As of 14 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 3 countries stands at 982, including 613 deaths.

Between 13-14 Jul 2014, 18 new cases and 11 deaths were reported from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. These include suspect, probable and laboratory-confirmed cases. The occurrence of community deaths, still being reported in Guinea, remains a serious concern. The respective Ministries of Health are working with WHO and its partners to step up outbreak containment measures.

Health sector response
----------------------
The national authorities in the 3 affected countries are scaling up outbreak containment measures.

- In Sierra Leone, the Ministry of Health has established an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) aimed to ensure effective coordination and accelerate implementation of EVD outbreak response. The EOC is chaired by the Minister of Health and co-chaired by the WHO Representative, with members including heads of the different sub-committees of the task force, other senior staff and key partners. The EOC will oversee the development of the prioritized operational plan in line with the Accra inter-country strategy, ensure that priority interventions are implemented as planned, and streamline communication and information flow.

- In Guinea, a high level political delegation comprising of the President of the National Assembly, the Ministers of Health and Communication, and senior government officials are conducting a 3-day field visit to Gueckedou, from 14-17 Jul 2014. The outbreak response in Gueckedou, where community deaths continue to be reported, encountered resistance and apprehension from the communities. The delegation engaged local and opinion leaders in order to build a relationship of trust with the community, which should foster optimum cooperation and enhance acceptance of outbreak control measures. As a result of this engagement and dialogue, leaders of 19 out of 23 villages pledged their commitment to embrace the EVD outbreak response. Meanwhile, leaders of the 4 villages that did not turn up for the meeting later made contacts with the local administrative authority, expressing their willingness to be part of the response. In addition, the national authority has established administrative and law enforcement mechanism to deal with extremes of resistance such as violence on the response teams.

- In Liberia, the Chief Medical Officer including senior officials of the Ministry of Health, WHO and other partners visited Foya district, the epicentre of EVD outbreak. The field visit aimed to streamline and strengthen implementation of outbreak containment measures. The delegation participated in the district task force meeting, held discussions with the district authority, partners and health care workers.

Meanwhile, efforts are ongoing to scale up and strengthen all aspects of outbreak response in the 3 countries, including contact tracing, public information and community mobilization, case management and infection prevention and control, etc.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[2] Guinea: Sub-regional Center

WHO Opens Regional Ebola Response Center
----------------------------------------
In response to continuing reports of new cases and deaths attributable to Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, WHO today [16 Jul 2014] activated a Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Center in Conakry, Guinea. "The center will act as a platform to consolidate and harmonize the technical support being provided to West African countries affected by the outbreak. It will also help to mobilize resources for the response," says Dr. Francis Kasolo, director for disease prevention and control for the WHO African Region and head of the Coordination Center. "Alongside national health authorities and WHO, other partner agencies involved in the EVD response, such as Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), the Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and technical partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), will also work from the center."

The establishment of the center was requested by health ministers from 11 African countries at an emergency meeting convened by WHO in Accra, Ghana, 2-3 Jul 2014. The Accra meeting identified critical challenges and gaps in the response: coordination, communications, cross-border collaboration, treatment of patients, contact tracing and community participation, human resources and financial support.

"Addressing these challenges in 3 countries will be far more efficient through a single coordination mechanism," says Dr. Benido Impouma, WHO epidemiologist and the technical coordinator of the new Center. "Finding and treating all EVD patients and then tracing and observing the close contacts of these persons over a period of 21 days to ensure they have not been infected is a key to halting transmission. This can be only done with full community participation."

As of 12 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 3 countries stands at 964, including 603 deaths.

[3] Sierra Leone: survivors
Date: Tue 15 Jul 2014
Source: Politico, Sierra Leone [edited]
http://politicosl.com/2014/07/60-cured-of-ebola-in-sierra-leone


A total of 60 people who had tested positive for Ebola virus disease have been cured of the haemorrhagic fever, according to a press release from the Ministry of Health and Sanitation issued yesterday [14 Jul 2014]. This, since the outbreak started in May [2014]. They have been duly discharged from the treatment centre and told to go home. At one such discharge witnessed by Politico, 2 "survivors" clutched their discharge certificates and laughed understandably so loudly that you could count all their teeth.

On the flip side however, yesterday's release says the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed cases stands at 346 people with 110 of them dead, making last week the deadliest since the onset of the outbreak -- with 30 people killed and nearly 70 new cases recorded.

The new cases include an Egyptian national who was a resident in Kenema [Eastern Province, Sierra Leone] but had his blood sample taken in Freetown [Western Province]. A health ministry spokesman, Sidi Yahya Tunis, told Politico that the North African, the 1st foreigner to test positive for the disease in Sierra Leone, had started showing signs of it in Kenema but travelled to Freetown where he was admitted to an Arab-run hospital where he allegedly hid himself receiving treatment. The hospital has been shut down. Assistant Inspector General [AIG] of Police for eastern Freetown, Memuna Conteh, said they shut it down on the orders of the health ministry. She said health officials had complained that they harboured the Egyptian and did not turn him over to the appropriate health authorities. The AIG said while bolting the hospital shut, they found one teenager receiving some treatment inside it.

Amid all this, laboratory technicians at the only Ebola-testing facility in the country have suspended their weekend strike action over the non-payment of a promised SLL 100 000 [about USD 23] monthly risk allowance. Some of the dozens of workers at the lab told Politico that they had decided on the suspension following pleas by their boss, James Massallay, to consider the present situation of the outbreak. The health workers' union and the authorities are locked in negotiations to resolve the impasse.

Meanwhile, religious leaders have called for 3 days of fasting for an end to the spread of the disease, which has now reached the south and the north.

[4] Sierra Leone: music to the rescue
Date: Thu 17 Jul 2014

http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200525794.shtml


The "God-father" of Sierra Leone's contemporary music industry Jimmy Yeanie Bangura, popularly known as Jimmy B, has joined the fight against the deadly Ebola virus disease in Sierra Leone through the launch of a song titled "The Ebola Song." This is not the 1st time that the musician turned filmmaker has done songs about development and national issues. He was at the forefront of the fight against HIV/AIDS, and his contribution towards bringing peace to Sierra Leone was even better documented. The outbreak of the virus has led to the death of about 110 people in Sierra Leone; Jimmy described the outbreak as "the biggest calamity that has befallen Sierra Leone after the war." He added: "We need to come together and fight together." "The Ebola Song" is aimed at raising awareness about the deadly virus that is spreading fast in the country.

[5] Liberia: spread

http://www.spa.gov.sa/english/

The ebolavirus has spread to 4 additional counties in Liberia, Health Ministry official Tolbert Nyenswah said Thursday [17 Jul 2014]. That brings the number of affected counties to 7 out of a total of 15.

According to DPA [German Press Agency], the 4 new counties are Bong and Bomi in the west, Nimba in the centre and Grand Gedeh in the east of the country. So far, Ebola virus disease [EVD] had affected mainly western Liberia. Nyenswah said at least 105 deaths have been recorded since the EVD outbreak [began] in May [2014].

The Liberian senate, meanwhile, said it wanted the lower house of parliament to join it in asking President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf to declare a state of emergency. The senators described the EVD outbreak as a threat to the livelihood and very existence of Liberians.

[6] Liberia: fake vaccine
Date: Thu 17 Jul 2014
Source: The New Dawn [edited]
http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12157:govt-alarms-over-fake-ebola-vaccine&catid=46:health&Itemid=60


A senior health official here [Liberia] has [raised the alarm about] the issuing of "false Ebola vaccine" by imposters, acting as health workers in Monrovia [Montserrado County] and surroundings.

Deputy Health Minister for Research Planning, Ms. Yah Zolia, told UNMIL radio Wednesday [16 Jul 2014] that the Health Ministry is receiving reports of imposters delivering what they claimed is an Ebola vaccine. Additionally, the deputy health minister said she personally received 2 calls from Paynesville and one from Brewerville [both in Montserrado County], of complaints that unidentified individuals posing as health workers were delivering the Ebola vaccine. She said the action by the alleged imposters is intended to create false hope within the public that there is a vaccine for ebolavirus, which she dismissed as unfounded. Ms. Zolia told UNMIL Radio that her staff did not name a specific community in which the false Ebola vaccine was being offered.

A vaccine is a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide resistance against one or several diseases. It also acts as a foreign substance that induces an immune response in the body without stirring up a disease. The deputy minister has, meanwhile, urged the public, including those who have reported the alleged act, to call the police and health authorities whenever such imposters appear in their communities.

"Whoever that is doing that needs to be arrested.... Whatever they are doing, they are causing more harm than good, because they are giving people false hope that there is a vaccine for Ebola," said Ms. Zolia.

Health authorities in Liberia have reported scores of Ebola related deaths, affecting both patients and nurses since the deadly virus broke out in the West African region, but there has been no official pronouncement of vaccine. Messages have continuously centered on preventive tips such as avoiding contact with infected persons, touching their vomit and urine, or dead bodies, among others.

Gambia increases surveillance in borders areas for Ebola control
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Gambian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has set up a task force to control the border areas as part of the country's efforts to prevent the infection of ebolavirus. Surveillance has been increased and strengthened at the border areas to monitor those going in and out of the country, officials told Xinhua Tuesday [16 Jul 2014].

[There is no sign of an end to the epidemic with 18 new cases and 11 more deaths in 2 days.

Profiteers such as those claiming to have an ebolavirus vaccine are a menace. People taken in by that claim will believe they are immune and not go to a hospital if they fall ill, but continue circulating in the community and infecting others. It is evidence of a disturbing level of public ignorance that the newspaper finds it necessary to explain to its readers exactly what a vaccine is.

One has to wonder what the Gambian border guards think of their new role. Have they been issued with disposable thermometers, gloves and masks? Where are they going to send suspected cases? In what transport? Have these details been thought through? - Mod.JW
