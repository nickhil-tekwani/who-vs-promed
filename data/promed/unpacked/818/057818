Oregon scientists confirmed today, 17 Aug 2011, that deer droppings
from Jaquith Strawberry Farm contained the same strain of _E. coli_
[O157:H7] that sickened people in Multnomah, Washington Clackamas,
Yamhill, and Clatsop counties. Lab testing confirmed deer as the
source of the outbreak," said William Keene, senior epidemiologist at
Oregon Public Health.

Scientists picked up environmental samples from fields at Jaquith
Strawberry Farm in rural Washington County and 10 tested positive for
_E. coli_ O157:H7. Of those, 6 matched the strain that sickened 15
people in Oregon, including a woman who died. The other 4 were
separate strains of _E. coli_ O157:H7.

Keene said the outbreak strain turned up in samples from fields in 3
separate locations. "It could be a single deer that conceivably
traveled from one field to another," Keene said. But he said the
positive tests probably indicate that several or perhaps many of the
deer around Jaquith's property carry O157:H7. But they don't know for
sure because they've not done much testing.

A total of 7 people were hospitalized in the outbreak and 3 suffered
kidney failure, Keene said.

[It is now clear that deer, feeding amongst the strawberry crops,
contaminated some berries with droppings. Although Shiga toxin
producing _E. coli_ are classically associated with cattle, other
animals can also be colonized in their gastrointestinal tract with
this pathogen including pigs, sheep, deer, and elk. As examples of the
association of non-cattle ruminants and this pathogen, _E. coli_ O157
has been isolated in wild deer (1), linked to deer meat jerky (2), and
deer and elk droppings have been suggested to be the source of
waterborne _E. coli_ O157 (3).
