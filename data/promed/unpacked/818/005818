Oat crown rust, an emerging threat to Pakistan
----------------------------------------------
Oat has a special position in Pakistan's economy, where it is mostly used
as fodder. It is suitable to local conditions because it is high yielding
and nutritious with 3 crops a year. It covers the "lean" periods
December-January and May-June when no other fodder is available. But a
global threat to oats has recently been reported in Pakistan -- crown rust
(_Puccinia coronata_). The word "crown" refers to the shape of a type of
spore and is not related to disease features.

Crown rust is difficult to control because of its life cycle, rapid changes
in pathogenicity, and host resistance breakdown. While oat crops for grain
have clearly defined seasons limiting the spread of rust, oats for forage
are grown as continuous green crops creating a "green bridge" on which the
rust can survive all year round. Despite a large number of resistance genes
available, the average effective life span of new crown rust resistant oat
cultivars is 3 to 5 years.

In Pakistan more than 35 per cent of land is under forage. Green yield of
oat in rain-fed areas is about 20 ton/ha [8 ton/acre] and 60-80 ton/ha
[24.3-32.4 ton/acre] in irrigated areas. Crown rust is an emerging threat
to Pakistan that hit some areas in the last 4-5 years. Pakistan and India
are not big producers of oat, but this crop makes a major contribution to
their national income. If their high dependency on oat fodder and low
actual production potential is superimposed with crown rust, it will leave
a bad memory in the history of Pakistan.

[Crown (or leaf) rust of cultivated or wild oats (_Avena_ species) is
caused by the fungus _Puccinia coronata_. While it can infect a number of
grasses, particularly ryegrass, the strains on grasses do not cross into
oats. Rye and barley may be slightly affected by crown rust, but these
strains will also not infect oats. Pustules containing orange spores are
produced on leaves and sheaths, and these are spread by wind and by
mechanical means. The life cycle of _P. coronata_ includes as obligate
alternate hosts buckthorn (_Rhamnus catharticus_) or alder buckthorn
(_Frangula alnus_) before it can infect oats again.

Severe epidemics have been reported with yield losses of 40 per cent or
even total crop loss. The disease is favoured by warm and humid weather.
Disease management may include timely fungicide applications, cultural
methods (for example early planting), and use of resistant oat varieties.
Eradication of reservoir hosts within about 2 km (1.2 mi) of oat fields is
also recommended, but in Pakistan, as described in the report above, this
appears to be impossible.
