Chinese researchers announced on Saturday [26 Oct 2013] that they had successfully developed [a] vaccine for the H7N9 avian influenza virus, after this flu strain had left more than 130 people infected, with 45 fatalities reported. Shu Yuelong, director of the Chinese National Influenza Center, said this is the 1st influenza vaccine ever developed by Chinese scientists. The vaccine [will] provide important technical support to battle the new flu strain, making contribution to H7N9 avian influenza virus epidemic control all over the world, said Shu, also director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza. The vaccine was jointly developed by the First Affiliated Hospital under the School of Medicine of the Zhejiang University, Hong Kong University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Food and Drug Control, and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

Li Lanjuan, leading researcher from the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said the team started research after they successfully isolated the H7N9 bird flu virus from the throat swab sample of an infected patient on 3 Apr 2013. The team applied plasmid reverse genetics and genetic reassortment, which was widely adopted by the world, to develop the vaccine seeds, which were later proved to be safe [compatible?] with embryonated chicken eggs, she said. Currently, the vaccine has passed testing on ferrets, which was conducted by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Drug authorities have also verified the vaccine [is compatible] with relevant requirements of Chinese Pharmacopoeia.

At the news conference on the research findings held Saturday [26 Oct 2013] in Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, medicine producers, such as Tianyuan Bio-Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, showed interest in vaccine's production, although the virus has not been spread widely enough [to justify] mass inoculation.

China reported the world's 1st human case for H7N9 avian influenza infection in March [2013]. As of Friday [25 Oct 2013], a total of 136 [actually 137] people were confirmed to have been infected with the virus, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC). Of the infected, 45 died, representing a fatality rate of 33.1 per cent. No cases have been reported so far in other countries. Liu Dengfeng, deputy chief of the science and education department of the NHFPC, said, as the weather temperature went down, the epidemic [could] return, considering new cases had been reported lately. On 15 and 23 Oct 2013, 2 new H7N9 avian influenza infection cases were reported in Zhejiang Province, the latest since the previous ones reported 2 months ago. "The successful development of H7N9 bird flu vaccine has brought new weapon for us to win the long-term battle," Liu said.

[This statement is encouraging, but perhaps somewhat premature. These Chinese scientists appear to have developed an H7N9 avian influenza virus vaccine by genetic manipulation, which can be propagated in embryonated eggs, and which has been shown to be immunogenic [and protective?] in a ferret model system. As yet no immunogenicity and safety evaluations appear to have been undertaken in human volunteers. Furthermore, a pharmaceutical partner has not been identified.

This may indeed be the 1st H7N9 vaccine to reach this stage of development, but it is unlikely to be the last. - Mod.CP]
