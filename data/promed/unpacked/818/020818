Schmallenberg" virus: Analysis of the Epidemiological Data and Assessment of Impact

ABSTRACT
--------
This scientific report provides an overall assessment of the impact of the infection on animal health, animal production and animal welfare of the provisionally named "Schmallenberg" virus (SBV), 1st detected in Germany. In Europe, 3745 holdings have been reported with SBV cases confirmed by laboratory testing across several Member States, mid May 2012. EFSA reviewed the epidemiological reports noting that SBV has been detected in cattle, sheep, goats and a bison. SBV antibodies have been detected in deer, and no other species are known to be affected. EFSA also confirms that new studies support the initial assessment undertaken by the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention that it is very unlikely that SBV poses a risk to humans. In terms of transmission routes, recent entomological investigations have identified SBV in field samples of biting midges of the _Culicoides obsoletus_ group. Currently, there is no evidence of any other route of transmission other than transplacental or vector borne routes. EFSA coordinated the collation of SBV epidemiological data during 2011-2012 in order to obtain comparable data for Europe. The maximum proportion of reported sheep holdings with SBV confirmed was 4 percent per country and 7.6 percent per region, while for cattle less than 1.3 percent of holdings were reported as SBV confirmed at both country and regional level. In order to assess the impact of SBV (spatial and temporal spread, proportion of affected holding and potential projection of arthrogryposis hydranencephaly syndrome cases), 3 models were used. In regions with SBV confirmed holdings, assuming a high prevalence of infection and post infection immunity, impact in the 2012-2013 calving and lambing season should be low. However, assuming SBV survived the winter of 2011, the models suggest that in unaffected regions with suitable temperatures for within herd transmission by vectors and high density of susceptible species (cattle and sheep), SBV infection is likely to spread. EFSA puts forward a number of recommendations to fill the knowledge gaps, these include but are not limited to: continuing serological investigations in affected regions and regions neighbouring affected areas, within herd and animal level impact investigation, monitoring putative vector population, setting SBV host vector transmission parameters, investigating other routes of transmission, host susceptibility, virulence and vulnerable period during gestation. Furthermore, the possible origins of the virus should be investigated as more information becomes available on the virus characteristics and infection epidemiology.

[The full report (89 pages) is available at http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/doc/2768.pdf. We hereby copy the recommendation chapter:

"It is recommended that serological investigations are continued both in affected regions and regions neighbouring the known affected areas in order to determine the geographic spread of SBV infection and estimate seroprevalence. Such information would be useful to reduce under-ascertainment and improve modelling predictions.

No data is available regarding within-herd impact. Information concerning the number of newborns and foetuses within a holding with arthrogryposis hydranencephaly syndrome (AHS) type clinical signs and other consequences of SBV infection such as loss of production is needed. This could be achieved by follow-up monitoring of selected herds to properly evaluate the impact and magnitude of the spread of SBV infection.

Continued monitoring of EU ruminant adult population in affected regions and regions neighbouring the known affected areas is necessary in order to early detect infection with SBV. Monitoring of the putative vector populations (distribution, abundance and SBV detection) should be continued.

SBV was observed for the 1st time in September 2011. Its origin is still not known and should be investigated as more information becomes available on the virus characteristics and infection epidemiology. Retrospective seroprevalence studies are also essential in order to estimate the start of the outbreak.

The following knowledge gaps should be addressed:

1. SBV vector competency and other vector host transmission parameters (e.g. data on the extrinsic incubation period);
2. Distribution, density and over wintering of Culicoides vectors;
3. SBV host vector transmission parameters;
4. Other routes of transmission;
5. Host susceptibility, species range, virulence and vulnerable period during gestation;
6. Development and duration of post infection immunity;
7. Potential extensions of the geographical spread model". - Mod.AS]
