Influenza update 137
--------------------
Summary
-------
- Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the northern
hemisphere is at baseline inter-seasonal levels.
- Transmission in tropical areas is low overall with focal areas of
transmission noted in a few countries of Central America and northern
South America, western and eastern regions of sub-Saharan Africa, and
tropical Asia.
- The influenza season has now started in South Africa and may be
starting in Australia as well. South Africa has continued to report
increasing numbers of both mild and severe cases, primarily related to
influenza A(H1N1)2009. Australia has noted a recent increase in
emergency room visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) and
significantly increased notifications of influenza activity in the
states of South Australia and Queensland.

The influenza season in the northern hemisphere temperate areas has
largely ended. In Canada, only two regions reported sporadic activity
in the past week and influenza virus detection was very low. In the
United States of America (USA), two pediatric deaths associated with
influenza A(H3N2) virus and influenza type B virus were reported,
however, rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) are below the seasonal
threshold. Only two of the clinical specimens tested in Mexico in the
past week were found to be positive to influenza. Influenza activity
in Europe, northern Africa, and north Asia remained at low levels or
none at all.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Overall, influenza activity in tropical zones remains low with some
focal areas of transmission. The Central America region has reported
low or no influenza activity for most countries. The previously noted
transmission of influenza A(H1N1)2009 in the Dominican Republic has
increased over the past 3 weeks, while Honduras and El Salvador
reported low levels of influenza type B transmission. In tropical
South America, Colombia has detected low level circulation of both
influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)2009, with the latter slightly
more common. Respiratory syncytial virus is also reported in Colombia,
though numbers are decreasing. The most common virus detected in
patients admitted to hospital with respiratory disease in Colombia was
influenza type A. Bolivia has reported increasing numbers of influenza
A(H3N2) detections for the past 8 weeks and currently about 20 percent
of clinical specimens tested are positive for the virus.

Transmission of influenza type B has been noted in West Africa. Mali,
Ghana, Togo, Nigeria and Cameroon all report moderate numbers of
positive influenza test results with influenza B. Ghana has also
reported smaller numbers of influenza A(H1N1)2009 and influenza
A(H3N2). The number of laboratory-confirmed cases has increased since
the last update in the area. In East Africa, transmission has
decreased to low levels in recent weeks as reported by Rwanda, Uganda
and Kenya. A mix of viruses was seen in East Africa in recent weeks
with Kenya and Uganda reporting primarily H1N1 (2009) and influenza
type B, while in Rwanda nearly all of the viruses detected have been
H3N2.

Overall, influenza activity in the tropical countries of Asian
continues to remain low. Sporadic activity has been reported in Sri
Lanka, Indonesia, southern part of China (including Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region), Singapore, Viet Nam, and Cambodia. Viral
distribution of these countries remains similar since the last update,
with a mixture of H1N1 (2009) and influenza type B. In India, small
numbers of H3N2 have been persistently detected over the last 3 weeks
after many weeks of no virus detection.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
South America
-------------
Influenza transmission remains low in the temperature regions of
South America. In Chile, ILI rates have increased slightly while
severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) rates have remained stable
and at low levels. Although influenza A(H1N1)2009 was the most
commonly detected influenza virus in Chile and Argentina, numbers of
viruses detected are very low. Uruguay reported sporadic cases of
influenza B and H1N1 (2009).

Southern Africa
---------------

http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/2011_07_01_influenza_southern_africa_circulation_main.pdf

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases of South Africa has
reported that influenza activity remains high. More than 80% of the
influenza viruses recovered from SARI cases in the last 2 weeks have
been influenza A(H1N1)2009. Influenza type B, has also been detected
in small but increasing numbers of cases. Only a few influenza A(H3N2)
have been reported.

Australia and New Zealand and South Pacific
-------------------------------------------
Influenza activity in both Australia and New Zealand remains low.
However, Australia noted a recent increase in emergency room visits
due to ILI. In addition, notifications of influenza activity have
risen significantly in the states of South Australia and Queensland,
with some increases also observed in other areas. Overall, the viruses
detected were mostly identified as influenza A(H1N1)2009 with lower
number of cases of influenza type B and H3N2, however, in South
Australia, 85 percent of viruses detected were influenza B with no
H3N2. National ILI consultation rate from New Zealand remains below
baseline activity. Influenza type B remains the most common virus
detected there, though influenza A(H1N1)2009 has been detected
sporadically in the past few weeks.

>From the peer-reviewed literature
---------------------------------
Three recently published studies investigated the effects of maternal
influenza infection and vaccination on pregnancy outcomes and newborn
respiratory disease.

One study from the United Kingdom compared the rates of stillbirth,
perinatal mortality, and neonatal mortality between a prospectively
identified cohort of pregnant women who were admitted to the hospital
with confirmed influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection and a historical cohort
of pregnant women admitted to hospital in 2005 and 2006. This study
found that perinatal mortality was significantly higher in
influenza-infected women compared to the historical cohort (39
deaths/1000 live births vs. 9 deaths/1000 live births respectively,
p<0.001) as was the likelihood of premature birth. (Pierce P et al.
Perinatal outcomes after maternal 2009/H1N1 infection: national cohort
study, BMJ 2011; 342:1351-1358.)

A 2nd study from the USA evaluated the impact of influenza
vaccination of pregnant mothers. This study followed a cohort of
pregnant women who gave birth to 4326 live infants between June 2004
and September 2006. The study looked at rates of prematurity in
infants born during the influenza season (October - May) and found
that pregnant mothers who received influenza vaccination were 72
percent less likely than unvaccinated women to deliver prematurely
during the period of most widespread influenza activity (adjusted OR =
0.28; 95 percent CI, 0.11­0.74). The odds of prematurity during the
period between influenza seasons was similar between the 2 groups.
(Omer SB et al. Maternal influenza immunization and reduced likelihood
of prematurity and small for gestational age births: a retrospective
cohort study, PLoS Med 2011; 8:e1000441.)

In the 3rd study, also from the USA, Poehling et al. evaluated
influenza-associated hospitalizations of infants from 3 geographically
diverse counties in the USA where population based hospital
surveillance has been carried out for several years. They found that
infants of vaccinated mothers are 45-48 percent less likely to be
hospitalized for influenza infection than those of unvaccinated
mothers in the 1st 6 months after birth (adjusted odds ratio, 0.52; 95
percent confidence interval, 0.30­0.91). (Poehling KA et al. Impact
of maternal immunization on influenza hospitalizations in infants, Am
J Obstet Gynecol 2011; S141-148.)


Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide
and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on
available epidemiological and virological data sources, including
FluNet (reported by the Global Influenza Surveillance Network) and
influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States.
Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of
data available at the time when the update is developed.

[In brief: Influenza activity in the temperate regions of the
northern hemisphere is negligible. The winter influenza season has now
started in Southern Africa and may be starting in Australia. The
predominant viruses are influenza A/H1N1 (2009) and influenza
A/(H3N2), except in South Australia where influenza B viruses
predominate. - Mod.CP]
