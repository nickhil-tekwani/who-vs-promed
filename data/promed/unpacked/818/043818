The health authorities of the municipality of Villa Montes confirmed the presence of visceral leishmaniasis in 2 dogs in the Ferroviario Bajo area, after diagnosing 7 cases of leishmaniasis in people from surrounding communities, as announced by Fides the head of the unit of Zoonosis and vectors of the municipality, Abimael Castrillo.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. The most common types are cutaneous and visceral. The cutaneous type causes skin sores; the visceral type affects internal organs such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow. Canine leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by the parasite _Leishmania infantum_, and the main route of transmission of this parasite is through the bite of a group of mosquitoes called sandflies.

The animals were isolated for a later application of humanitarian euthanasia, Castrillo detailed in time to lament the situation. In the places where these types of cases were detected, the corresponding cleaning and weeding was carried out to eliminate the breeding spaces for the transmitting mosquito.

"Humane euthanasia will be applied to animals in order to eliminate the reservoir of the disease. Although there is a treatment for this disease, it is too expensive and does not exist in our country, and it is also a very long treatment, which is not 100% effective," he said.

[Leishmaniasis in dogs
"The parasite is transmitted by a small biting sand fly and is an important disease because humans can also contract leishmaniasis. You cannot become infected with leishmaniasis from your dog or cat.

"Leishmaniasis can cause one or two types of infections, a cutaneous or skin infection and a visceral or organ infection.

"Leishmaniasis is common in the Mediterranean, South and Central America, and southern Mexico. It has been reported in Oklahoma, Ohio, and Texas and is considered endemic in foxhounds in the United States.

"What are the clinical signs of leishmaniasis?
Virtually all dogs will develop the visceral form of the disease. Ninety percent will also have cutaneous involvement. The clinical signs associated with the visceral form include fever, anorexia (lack of appetite), weakness, exercise intolerance, severe weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding from the nose, and blood in the stool (usually seen as dark, tarry stools called melena). About 1/3 of dogs will develop swollen lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen and will progress to kidney failure. Muscle pain, joint inflammation, and swelling of the testicles may also be seen.

"Clinical signs of the cutaneous form most commonly include thickening and hardening of the tissues on the muzzle and foot pads, called hyperkeratosis. Many dogs will lose the pigment or dark coloring of these tissues as the disease progresses. Nodules or hard lumps may form in the skin, and the coat often appears dull and brittle with areas of hair loss. The cutaneous form more commonly affects cats.

"How is the disease diagnosed?
Leishmaniasis is diagnosed on medical history, especially recent travel to an area with endemic leishmaniasis, and clinical signs. Blood and urine tests are usually performed along with tissue biopsies. In the United States, if your pet is diagnosed with leishmaniasis, it must be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Canada, leishmaniasis has not been reported to occur, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) lists it as one of the "non-reportable list B" diseases.

"Occasionally, the organism can be found on aspirates of lymph nodes or smears made from skin lesions, but these are not very sensitive. A blood test called a PCR can be sent away to an outside laboratory. This test has the best chance of diagnosis of leishmaniasis, though the test is not 100%. General blood tests may reflect changes if specific organs are affected.

"Is there any treatment?
The treatment requires administration of a special drug, sodium stibogluconate, which is available from the CDC. Alternative treatments include meglumine antimonite (not available in the USA or Canada), allopurinol and/or amphotericin B, most often in combination. Supportive treatments include intravenous fluid support, special diets, and antibiotics if the skin lesions are infected. Solitary skin lesions can be removed surgically.

"What is the prognosis?
The prognosis for a pet diagnosed with leishmaniasis is very guarded to grave. Most dogs die from kidney failure. Severely ill pets may not be able to undergo treatment. Your veterinarian will provide you with specific treatment recommendations based on your pet's condition." (https://vcahospitals.com/meadowdale/know-your-pet/leishmaniasis-in-dogs) - Mod.TG
