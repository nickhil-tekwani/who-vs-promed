The Ministry of Health confirmed today [18 Nov 2015] 3 cholera cases in the province of Pedernales, where it had reported several suspected cases of this disease. Deputy of Collective Health Nelson Rodriguez Monegro said people reported episodes of acute diarrheal disease (ADD) in Pedernales.

So far, only 3 tested positive for cholera, and no deaths have been reported from the disease on the Dominican side following the outbreak of the disease detected in Haiti. Through a statement, the official said that for weeks they have been following up on cases of diarrhea that presented in the slums established by the Haitian authorities on the west bank of the Pedernales River in La Paca communities and Step II Sign. He explained that the provincial Elio Fiallo hospital had 22 suspect cases of cholera, 3 of whom are Dominicans, including an employee of the hospital. The others are Haitian nationals.

Monegro Rodriguez explained that cholera was disproven in 5 patients, while the rest remain under observation to determine whether they have the disease. "Currently, the hospital has only 4 patients admitted with acute diarrhea. It was confirmed that 2 of them do not have cholera, and they will be discharged on Tuesday, 24 Nov 2015," he said. At the same time, he said that the next few hours will determine the condition of the others.

Rodriguez said that in the municipality of Duverge, Independencia Province, a Haitian mother and her daughter showed signs of acute diarrhea and were admitted to the Jose Perez municipal hospital and subsequently referred to the Jaime Mota Hospital of Barahona, where they are being hydrated and will be released in the coming hours.

[2] Cholera - Haiti

Number of IDPs in camps 2015: 60 801
Cumulative cholera cases (1 Jan 2015 to 19 Sep 2015): 22 511
Fatality cases (1 Jan 20115 to 19 Sep 2015): 185
Cholera outbreak: 15 communes on red alert

With the heavy rains of October 2015, the health officials have observed a resurgence of cholera cases in several communes, notably in the departments of Artibonite, West, South East, South and North. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) in the situation report from 18-29 Oct 2015 affirms that in these departments, more than 400 alerts were recorded.

The document indicates that about 15 communes are on red alert. The situation is more critical in Cite Soleil (91 cases), Marigot (51 cases), St. Mark (36 cases) and Jacmel (33 cases) communes. Humanitarian officials estimate that untreated water consumption and poor hygiene practices are the causes of transmission of 73 percent of the cases investigated.

The UNICEF-PAHO technical team recalled the partners to improve surveillance because the end of the year is the period in which the number of cholera cases tends to increase both in the departments and in the capital. They encouraged better coordination, more flexibility of intervention, and information sharing between actors doing interventions in WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) and health sectors.

The Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO), UNICEF, and health departments have intensified activities of rapid response to alerts. Distribution of chlorinated products and oral serum, community awareness, and decontamination of houses, dormitories and sanitary facilities were held in affected communities.

[Haiti continues, despite much overt reporting, to be the top of the haystack for cholera cases, underscoring the continued inability of health organizations to effectively reverse the epidemic. Providing clean, safe water and adequate sanitation can go a long way to help minimize the situation. It is not likely that _V. cholerae_ will soon disappear from the water there. - Mod.LL
