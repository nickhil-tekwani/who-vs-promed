The Director of Zoonoses of Chascomus district [Buenos Aires province], Julia Francese, stated this Thursday [20 Nov 2014] to Diagonales that the man who died several days ago, a victim of a hantavirus [infection], could not have contracted this disease [hantavirus pulmonary syndrome; HPS] in the slaughter house where he was a worker, indicating that "there is no indication that the infection could have been possible [there]."

Following the death of the 37-year-old man -- confirmed officially this past Wednesday [19 Nov 2014, as HPS] -- set off a conflict within the company, which resulted in the workers refusing to go to work.

"There are no indications that the infection could have been possible [there]," stated Francese when interviewed by this medium. And she explained that the dead worker, who lived at km 112 of highway 12, worked in the deboning area of the slaughter house, "an area that is continuously cleaned up. In general, the slaughter house is in a good state of cleanliness," she stated.

[Unfortunately, there is no indication of the circumstances under which the man became infected, now that his workplace has been discarded as the source. This is the 2nd fatal case of HPS in in Buenos Aires province this year (2014). The hantavirus involved in this case is not identified. Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in north western Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
