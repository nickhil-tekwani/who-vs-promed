Meatballs kill dogs; poison suspected
-------------------------------------
More meatballs thought to have been poisoned were found in a Spokane
neighborhood after at least 3 dogs there died on Friday [19 Feb 2010] upon
eating earlier batches.

Several more batches were found Monday on streets in the South Hill
neighborhood, KREM-TV reported, though no more pets were reported to have
died or fallen ill.

On Friday [19 Feb 2010], a woman saw her dog eat some meatballs on the
street and then go into convulsions before dying. A man also had 2 of his
dogs die Friday after eating the meatballs.

The Humane Society of the United States is offering a USD 2500 reward for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is responsible.

Washington State University is testing the meatballs to determine if they
contained poison.

[While the toxin has not yet been identified, it is certainly suspicious. A
possible toxin in the meatballs could be strychnine, since animals
consuming strychnine tend to seizure prior to death. We will be waiting for
the results of the tests.

Cases like this frequently become criminal cases and law enforcement
certainly wants to remove such a person from causing more harm to pets. -
