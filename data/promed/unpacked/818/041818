Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Viet Nam
------------------------------
As of 29 Apr 2012, the Vietnam Ministry of Health has confirmed nearly 40 000 cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) since the beginning of 2012. Cases have occurred in 63 provinces, and 20 deaths (all in children under 5) have occurred in 10 provinces. Hai Phong in the North has the highest number of cases, followed by Bac Can, Yen Bai, Lao Cai, Hoa Binh, Da Nang, Vinh Phuc, Quang Tri, Dong Thap, and Binh Dinh Provinces in the Center and Southern Regions. The Viet Nam Ministry of Health is taking steps to control the outbreak.

Large outbreaks of severe HFMD occur frequently in some countries in Asia. Thousands of people may get infected during these outbreaks. Some people, particularly young children, may have severe disease requiring hospitalization or even causing death. To learn more outbreaks occurring around the world, visit the World Health Organization's website.

HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children under 5 years of age. Adults can also get the disease. Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, blister-like sores in the mouth (often painful), and a rash. HFMD is spread from person to person by direct contact with the saliva, nasal secretions, blister fluid, and stool of an infected person. The virus can also be spread when an infected person touches objects and surfaces that are then touched by others. An infected person is most contagious during the 1st week of the illness. However, the virus can stay in the stool for weeks after symptoms go away. In addition, people with HFMD do not always show signs of infection, but still could have the potential to spread the disease.

There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent HFMD. However, you can protect yourself from HFMD by practicing healthy personal hygiene. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before eating and after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner with at least 60 percent alcohol. Consider packing alcohol-based hand cleaner in your carry-on luggage to ensure you have it when needed. Disinfect dirty surfaces and soiled items. If you are able, 1st wash the items with soap and water; then disinfect them with a solution of chlorine bleach (made by mixing 1 tablespoon of bleach with 4 cups of water) or a cleaning product that contains bleach. Avoid close contact such as kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils or cups with people who have HFMD.

There is no specific treatment for HFMD. If you do develop mouth sores: Take over-the-counter medications to relieve pain and fever. (Caution: Aspirin should not be given to children.) Use mouthwashes or sprays that numb mouth pain. Drink plenty of liquids to stay hydrated.

[Although this travel alert is directed towards travellers to Viet Nam, the advice is equally appropriate for travellers to many other destinations in south and south-east Asia. Indeed HFMD outbreaks are reported almost daily in HealthMap alerts derived from Chinese language sources which as a consequence pass without comment. Interested readers can view a rare English language account of such an outbreak in the Shanghai Daily recording the death of 19 individuals in Hunan province, see:http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/article_xinhua.asp?id=70792.

HFMD is caused by a variety of enteroviruses, rarely identified, that vary with place and time. Outbreaks without identification of the causative agent may not be recorded by ProMED-mail.
