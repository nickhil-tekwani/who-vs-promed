Not all hospitals in Ontario have experienced an increase in MRSA. Because
of concern with MRSA coupled with frequent admissions of children from
areas with high prevalence of MRSA, The Hospital for Sick Children, a
tertiary care hospital, has had an infection control policy for the past
15 years requiring bacteriologic screening of all children admitted to the
hospital who have been hospitalized anywhere outside of Canada in the
previous 12 months. It is recommended that screening (nasal swab) be done
prior to admission or transfer to Toronto. If the patient has not been
screened prior to admission, the patient is isolated until results of
screening are available. Approximately 3-5 MRSA colonized children have been
identified per year. There has been no increase in prevalence of MRSA since
1985. Although this control program appears to be successful, a new trend
has recently emerged. In the past two years, half of the MRSA-infected
children identified at the hospital were born in Canada and had not been
previously hospitalized anywhere, indicating that MRSA is present in the
community. The same screening policy has also been applied to detect
carriage of vancomycin resistant enterococci.
