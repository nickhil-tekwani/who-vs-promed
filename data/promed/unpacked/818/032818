[1] Delta subvariant

A new coronavirus descendant related to delta, called AY.4.2, is being closely monitored by scientists in the USA, UK, and Israel. AY.4.2 is still "very rare" in the USA, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "It is well below 0.05% of all our sequenced viruses, with less than 10 reported in our database so far," the CDC said in a statement sent to Insider on Wednesday [20 Oct 2021].

Meanwhile, AY.4, the parent lineage of the new variant, "represents around 11% of the delta viruses in the United States," the CDC said. While many different AY lineages of the delta variant have been documented to date, AY.4.2 has caught the attention of virus-watchers around the world recently because it has 2 changes located on the viral spike protein, which could perhaps give it some advantages. But it's unclear if that's the case yet. "At this time...there is no evidence that the sublineage A.Y.4.2 impacts the effectiveness of our current vaccines or therapeutics," the CDC said.

The UK Health Security Agency said on Friday [15 Oct 2021] that AY.4.2 is currently "expanding" in England and is "increasing in frequency" there, representing an estimated 6% of sequenced strains in the country. Israeli health officials reported their 1st documented case of AY.4.2 on Tuesday [19 Oct 2021] (https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/first-case-of-delta-mutation-ay-4-2-diagnosed-in-israel/).

Former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on Twitter over the weekend that "we need urgent research" to figure out how much of a threat the new delta descendant really poses. It's possible that AY.4.2 could turn out to be slightly more transmissible than other versions of the virus we've seen so far. But that's no reason to panic.

"This is not a situation comparable to the emergence of alpha and delta that were far more transmissible (50% or more) than any strain in circulation at the time," Professor Francois Balloux, Director of the University College London Genetics Institute, said on Tuesday [19 Oct 2021]. "Here we are dealing with a potential small increase in transmissibility that would not have a comparable impact on the pandemic."

"We have, on occasion, identified the sublineage here in the United States, but not with recent increased frequency or clustering to date," CDC director Rochelle Walensky said during a White House coronavirus briefing Wednesday [20 Oct 2021] morning, referencing AY.4.2. (The UK, which has noticed a larger uptick in AY.4.2 cases recently, has been far better than the USA at tracking and sequencing coronavirus variants in real time during the pandemic.)

Jeffrey Barrett, a genomics expert leading the COVID-19 initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said it's still possible that AY.4.2 has just had a bit of "epidemiological luck" in the UK recently. Professor Balloux agreed. "In Denmark, the other country that besides the UK has excellent genomic surveillance in place, it reached a 2% frequency but has gone down since," he said of the subvariant.

[2] China: increased restrictions
Date: Fri 22 Oct 2021 05:42 EDT

A new COVID-19 outbreak has spurred parts of China to increase restrictions on movement, with the capital Beijing sealing off some areas and northwestern regions imposing a range of transport curbs and closing public venues. China, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019, reported 28 new domestically transmitted cases for Thursday [21 Oct 2021], more than double the 13 cases a day earlier, health authority data showed on Friday [22 Oct 2021].

The numbers are tiny compared to elsewhere in the world, but Chinese cities are quick to contain outbreaks under tough national guidelines of zero tolerance. The Changping district of Beijing banned people in certain higher-risk areas from leaving their residential compounds, suspended face-to-face classes at schools close to those areas and ordered nearby businesses to halt operations, an official told a news briefing.

Six local cases, some of the highly transmissible delta variant, were detected this week in Beijing city, which has vowed high vigilance ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics Games in February [2022]. Beijing city has started injecting booster vaccine doses, with groups including people taking part in the Games given priority.

In Hebei province next to Beijing, the cities of Xingtai and Baoding, a few hours' drive from Zhangjiakou that is co-hosting the Games with Beijing, this week found a total of 4 local asymptomatic infections, which China counts separately as confirmed cases.

The majority of the 70 local confirmed cases reported since 16 Oct 2021 were from northwestern China -- Gansu province, Ningxia autonomous region and some northwestern areas of Inner Mongolia, which in general are remote and do not have as much health resources as major cities.

Around a dozen cities in Gansu province, many of which have yet to report any local infections, halted some long-distance bus services as of Friday [22 Oct 2021] morning, state television said. A few trains linking Gansu's capital, Lanzhou, and the outside had been halted, while only one flight from Lanzhou to Beijing was allowed, an official said on Thursday [21 Oct 2021].

In Qinghai province, an airport has halted serving passengers transferring flights. The province reported one local case on Thursday [21 Oct 2021], the 1st this year. All tourist attractions in Ningxia, and some in Gansu and Qinghai, have been suspended. Travellers arriving from overseas who have stayed in China for fewer than 28 days have to take tests before they are allowed to enter Ningxia and are required to stay indoors for a week of health monitoring on arrival.

China's railway authorities have halted the loading of cargo destined for some stations in the [Xinjiang] region until the end of October [2021], citing virus control measures without giving further details. Xinjiang reported one local confirmed case and 5 asymptomatic infections earlier this month [October 2021]. It has reported no infections since 16 Oct 2021.

As of Thursday [21 Oct 2021], China has had a total 96 665 confirmed coronavirus cases. The death toll stood at 4636.

[China is preparing for the winter Olympics and seemed to be doing very well with keeping COVID under control. But in July and August 2021, the highly transmissible delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 quickly spread to dozens of cities and towns, threatening China's status of having the virus controlled.

"As they had before, authorities pursued a goal of full elimination. The strategy is always the same. Phone app health clearance is implemented in order to enter public buildings, track and trace methods go into overdrive and, as infected people are identified, their housing estates placed into lockdown.

"[In September 2021], this latest outbreak seems to have been reined in like those before it but officials remain on alert to guard against any new clusters threating the Games with several measures in place.

"Entry and exit to the Olympic city can be controlled if needed. Transport links from high-risk areas can be suspended and travellers coming to the capital Beijing from medium risk locations could be required to have negative coronavirus tests.

"With these tools, officials are hoping to have zero domestic COVID infections when the Winter Games begin" (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58196467).

Since they do plan to allow spectators, albeit only from China according to the policy set by the International Olympic Committee, it will be interesting to follow how well they are able to control spread. - Mod.LK]

[3] UK: restrictions
Date: Wed 20 Oct 2021
Source: CNBC [abridged, edited]
https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/uk-doctors-call-for-return-of-covid-restrictions-new-mutation-watched.html


U.K. medical professionals have issued an urgent plea to the British government to reimpose some Covid restrictions due to the increased level of infections and hospitalizations in the country.

Health leaders warned late Tuesday [19 Oct 2021] that the U.K. risks "stumbling into a winter crisis" if the government does not enact its "Plan B," a pledge it made last month [Sep 2021] in which it said it would reimpose Covid measures if data suggested the National Health Service was "likely to come under unsustainable pressure."

Officials at the NHS Confederation, which represents organizations across the U.K. healthcare sector, issued a statement calling on the government "to introduce measures, such as mandatory face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces, without delay to keep people well and avoid the NHS from becoming overwhelmed this winter."

They warned that the National Health Service "is seeing worrying increases in coronavirus cases in its hospitals and the community at a time when it is preparing for a busy winter period, its staff are close to burnout, and it is being expected to recover many of its services that were disrupted by the pandemic."

The U.K. is currently recording between 40 000 and 50 000 new Covid cases a day and the number of hospitalizations and deaths is steadily rising, although at a much lower pace than earlier in the pandemic thanks to Covid vaccines, which greatly reduce the risk of severe infection, hospitalization and death.

On Tuesday [19 Oct 2021], the U.K. reported 43 738 new Covid cases, a decrease from Monday [18 Oct 2021] when 49 156 new cases were recorded, which marked the highest daily number in 3 months.

To date, the U.K. has recorded over 8.5 million Covid cases and on Tuesday [19 Oct 2021], 223 new deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, bringing the total number of fatalities to 138 852 -- putting it among a grim ranking of countries with the highest death tolls in the world. ...

New mutation
Making matters worse, potentially, is a new mutation of the delta variant that British experts are watching closely.

Last Friday [15 Oct 2021], the U.K.'s Health Security Agency issued a report in which it said "a delta sublineage newly designated as AY.4.2 is noted to be expanding in England" and that it was monitoring the subtype.

This new descendent of the delta Covid variant, AY.4.2, has been identified in an increasing number of U.K. Covid cases, with some suggesting it might be another possible factor in rising case numbers, although it is too early to tell for sure.

"This sublineage is currently increasing in frequency. It includes spike mutations A222V and Y145H. In the week beginning [27 Sep 2021] (the last week with complete sequencing data), this sublineage accounted for approximately 6% of all sequences generated, on an increasing trajectory. This estimate may be imprecise ... Further assessment is underway," the U.K. Health Security Agency noted. ...

Why is the UK in this mess?
Experts say there are a variety of reasons for the U.K.'s steep Covid numbers -- ranging from the half-hearted mask adoption (even when masks are required, such as on public transport, the rule is rarely enforced) to large indoor gatherings that have allowed the virus to spread.

The U.K.'s hesitation in vaccinating younger teenagers, something that other countries in Europe and the U.S. did much earlier, and the return to schools in September [2021], have also been cited as reasons for the sharp rise in cases. Although the boom in infections among 0-18 year olds is now ebbing, infections are rising in their parents' generation, data shows.

Ironically, the U.K.'s early vaccination rollout -- which began in December 2020 and was one of the first in the world -- is also seen as contributing to its high case rate now because we know -- due to an increasing body of data -- that immunity in vaccinated people wanes after about 6 months. To date, 78.9% of the U.K. population over the age of 12 is fully vaccinated, official data shows.

The UK Health Security Agency today announced the offshoot of delta, known as AY.4.2 has been designated a variant under investigation due to it becoming increasingly common in the UK.

"We shouldn't be blaming the virus for what is going on in the UK," said Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge. "It is because we have fundamentally failed to control transmission, and that is because kids are vulnerable, they have not been vaccinated, they are back at school, they are spreading virus among themselves and they are feeding it into their families."

All this, he added, was happening with delta dominant, which research had shown had greater ability to evade an immune response than the alpha variant.

"It breaks through the vaccines anyway, so vaccines protect you partially from an infection being transmitted but it is not complete protection," he said. "So the message needs to be, let's stop worrying about mutations and worry about the fact we have uncontrolled transmission in the UK."

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 22 Oct 2021at 06:50 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 143 236 / 453 076 / 324
Bangladesh: 1 566 907 / 27 801 / 167
Pakistan: 1 267 393 / 28 344 / 125
Nepal: 807 522 / 11 326 / 380
Sri Lanka: 533 860 / 13 562 / 630
Afghanistan: 155 891 / 7249 / 181
Maldives: 86 550 / 240 / 434
Bhutan: 2617 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 105 644, 2422, 4622, 3246, and 4105 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 122 023, 3667, 6538, 3994, and 6205 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in these South Asian countries. The development of immunity in significant sections of these countries' populations due to natural infection and by vaccination could play a role in seeing such sustained dropping of new cases in recent times. The daily case positivity is now just over 1% (1.19%) in India, around 1.5% in Bangladesh, and just below 2% in Pakistan.

India has crossed a significant milestone in COVID-19 vaccination as more than 1000 million doses of the vaccine have been administered, as indicated in item [2] above. Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. So far, of the target population, 33% have received the 1st dose and 17% have received both the 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

The country has also decided to vaccinate school children below the age of 18, and a total of 112 students belonging to 4 government schools in Manikganj district in Dhaka division were reportedly vaccinated on 14 Oct 2021 with Pfizer jabs as part of a test run (https://m.theindependentbd.com/post/269067). As of 22 Oct 2021 at 12:49 PM, a total of 99 335 067 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 14 885 262 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 27 627 779 doses of the vaccine. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 63.4% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

The country is also vaccinating 18- and 19-year-olds against the disease with Pfizer vaccine (https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-begins-vaccinating-18-19-age group/article37001914.ece). - Mod.PKB
