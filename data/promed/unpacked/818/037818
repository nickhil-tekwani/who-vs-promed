China: Undiagnosed respiratory illness
---------------------------------------------
According to reports from China News Service, 60 students and teachers
developed fever at midday on 28 Dec 2006 in a middle school in Shanxi's
Wenxi County. The day before yesterday [29 Dec 2006], an expert medical
team held discussions and felt that the cause of fever among students and
teachers might be an upper respiratory tract infection due to mycoplasma or
chlamydia. But the final diagnosis has yet to be made. For now, hospitals
are providing symptomatic treatment to febrile patients.
By 11:00 a.m. on 29 Dec 2006, the number of febrile students at Chengguan
Middle School had increased by 14, bringing the total to 74. Of these, 12
have been treated and released from hospital. 57 remain hospitalized for
treatment, and 5 are undergoing medical observation at home. Of the 57
hospitalized patients, there are 5 whose temperatures exceed 38 C.
Temperatures of the others are below 38 C.
With the agreement of the county's education department, classes were
suspended for more than 1600 students in 20 classes from the afternoon of
28 Dec 2006, and they went home for observation.
The municipal and county level Centers for Disease Control have already
taken swab and blood samples from some patients and sent them to the lab of
Yuncheng City's Center for Disease Control. Preliminary diagnosis is upper
respiratory tract infection caused by mycoplasma or chlamydia. But a final
diagnosis must await results of the laboratory's analysis.

China: Undiagnosed fever affects 60 in a Middle School in Shanxi province
-----------------------------------------------
The Shanxi Youth Daily reports that at 10:00 a.m. on 27 Dec 2006, the
director of 7th grade Class 137 at Shanxi's Wenxi County Chengguan Middle
School, Teacher Zhang, found that some students had developed fever and
cough. After the school sought guidance from the Wenxi County Education
Bureau, it sent ill students to the hospital for treatment. Afterward,
students continued to be admitted to hospital for fever. Between 10:00 a.m.
on 27 Dec 2006 and 12:00 noon on 28 Dec 2006, 59 students and one teacher
had been admitted to the Infectious Disease Department of Wenxi County
People's Hospital.
Chengguan Middle School Principal Zhang was found at the entrance to Wenxi
County People's Hospital's Infectious Disease Department. He stated that
after the 2nd period on the morning of 27 Dec 2006, the director of 7th
grade Class 137, Teacher Zhang, found that some students were coughing and
had fever. Teacher Zhang immediately informed the school administration of
the situation. The school quickly reported to the Wenxi Education Bureau.
Then, the 1st 36 students showing symptoms were rushed to Wenxi County
People's Hospital. Teacher Zhang, who was the 1st to notice the fever [in
students], was also admitted to the hospital for fever on the afternoon of
27 Dec 2006.
Yesterday [28 Dec 2006] morning, special guards were seen posted at the
entrance to the Wenxi County People's Hospital Infectious Disease
Department. All personnel must wear cotton masks and must have permission
from the hospital administration to enter. Medical personnel wear isolation
gowns. Inside, more than 20 students in relatively serious condition
receive IV therapy in the ward. Others students in less serious condition
sit in a room near the department entrance and are on oral medication. All
students in the department wear masks as required.
Yesterday [28 Dec 2006] at noon, the Wenxi County government stated that,
within a day after students came down with fever, the number of patients
had increased to 60, affecting 6 classes in grade 7 and grade 8 at
Chengguan Middle School.
Of 60 patients, there are 39 males and 21 females. Five are between 11 and
13 years old, 2 are 14 years old, and one is 40 years old. 29 have fever
accompanied by cough. Three have temperatures above 39 C, 17 between 38-39
C, and 9 between 37-38 C. Another 31 have temperatures around 37 C.
This incident has attracted concern from countless parents in Wenxi.
Yesterday [28 Dec 2006] morning, several dozen parents anxiously waited in
the cold wind outside the hospital's Infectious Disease Department for the
diagnosis.
Chengguan Middle School's Administrative Director Tian told reporters that
Christmas holiday was just prior to this incident. So some people suspect
that when students burned spray-string ribbons on Christmas Eve, they
inhaled a large amount of toxic gas, which caused their fevers. Director
Tian confirmed that some ill students had burned spray-string ribbons. The
school has already registered the names of students who burned this type of
ribbon on Christmas Eve.
A parent said that there were reports from overseas of burning spray-string
ribbon causing respiratory ailments. This parent said that the students'
symptoms had similarities to those in the overseas cases but that the exact
diagnosis must be made by experts.
As events occurred, Wenxi County health and education departments reported
to the Wenxi People's Government at 10:10 a.m. on 27 Dec 2006. At 11:48
a.m., personnel from the county's Center for Disease Control ruled out the
possibility of food poisoning through lab investigations. At 12:45 p.m.,
the situation was reported to the Office of Yuncheng City People's
Government. From then, Wenxi County People's Government immediately put in
place emergency public health contingency plans and formed a leadership group.
On the afternoon of 27 Dec 2006, infectious disease specialists and
epidemiologists from the Yuncheng City Medical Rescue Group rushed to
Wenxi, quickly starting treatment of students and opening an
epidemiological investigation.
Yesterday [28 Dec 2006] at about 2:00 p.m., a female doctor from the
Infectious Disease Department of Wenxi County People's Hospital told
reporters that chest radiographs of 20 patients showed inflammatory
changes, and some had abnormal blood counts. Based on symptoms, preliminary
diagnosis is pulmonary infection. But the specific disease cannot be
confirmed until expert diagnosis is made.
Yesterday [28 Dec 2006] at 4:00 p.m., the Wenxi People's Government stated
that 8 of 60 patients had shown obvious improvement after symptomatic
treatment. The hospital is now implementing "consolidation treatment" of
these 8 patients.
As late as 5:00 p.m. yesterday [28 Dec 2006], ongoing treatment of sick
students and teachers was continuing.
