Symptoms of high fever, headache, malaise, nausea, and vomiting affected
residents of Tver and suggested the beginning of an outbreak of
influenza-like respiratory disease. However Liliya Evmenchik, deputy chief
of the epidemiological surveillance center told journalists that the
illness was in fact "intestinal" flu, a common designation in Tver for
rotavirus infection.
According to the chief of the emergency center Aleksand Aronov, the number
of house calls to people suffering from symptoms of intestinal flu had
increased 60-70 fold in the past few days. According to Liliya Shevchenko,
deputy chief of the hospital, city hospitals will not be closed for
quarantine, since the outbreak is not extensive. She advised the population
to drink more fluids (such as weak tea or boiled water) and avoid acid
fruits like apples and oranges. She stated that there was no danger of a
city-wide epidemic since the weather is still very cold and the conditions
are unfavourable for rapid dissemination of virus. She recommended families
to seek medical assistance to verify a diagnosis of rotavirus infection and
not to resort to antibiotics but to drink lots of liquids. Water should
boiled before use. The sources of rotavirus infection are contaminated food
products, especially milk, tap water, fruit juice, and vegetables.

[Winter is the most favorable time for rotavirus outbreaks. The cause of
the outbreak in Tver is likely to be poor water quality, since fecal-oral
transmission is the usual route of infection. - Corresp.VM
Usually children are most at risk from outbreaks of rotavirus disease, but
this report unfortunately contains no information on the age distribution
of cases.
Tver is a city of some 400 000 people and is the administrative centre of
Tver Oblast. It is located at the confluence of the Volga and Tvertsa
Rivers. The city was known as Kalinin from 1931 to 1990. An interactive map
at <http://www.travelpost.com/AS/Russia/Tver/Tver/map/1641610> shows the
location of the city and the Oblast. - Mod.CP]
