After catching Kolkata [formerly Calcutta] [unprepared], dengue has now spread
to several district towns. In Salt Lake, 10 people have been affected. Health
officials fear that in the next 15-20 days the disease may create havoc in the
districts. Mr K K Bagchi, the health secretary, said that about 300 people are
affected and a total of 11 people have died of dengue.
The majority of the deceased and infected are from Kolkata. However, he
admitted that a number of people from the district towns have tested zero-
positive [i.e. show antibody evidence of having been infected - Mod.JW]. The
figure provided by the health authorities clearly suggests that the disease is
now getting a grip in the districts.
The number of affected people in the districts is 60-65. The breakdown is:
Salt Lake 10-24; Parganas (North) 20 to 25; Hooghly and Howrah 10 each; South
Parganas 5-6, and Nadia, Burdwan, Birbhum, Murshidabad one each.
Officials [fear] that carriers of the virus would migrate to nearby district
towns and the number of affected would increase in the next 2 weeks.
The health secretary said that World Health Organization's guidelines for the
treatment of the dengue-affected has been supplied to all the state hospitals
and nursing homes to make them familiar with proper treatment.
Authorities also said that Mac Elisa [ELISA] test kits have been sent to all 4
district medical colleges so that dengue confirmation tests can be carried out
there. This will speed up the time required to bring samples and undergo the
confirmation test at School of Tropical Medicine or at NICED.
The Purulia CMOH [Chief Medical Officer of Health], Dr Bhujanga Bhusan Patra,
confirmed today that [3 children 16 years old and under], all from Purulia
district, died of dengue in the past 2 days. Officials also confirmed that 24
more people were suffering from the disease in the district, Statesman News
Service adds from Purulia. Mr Bikash Bhattacharya, the mayor, Kolkata
Municipal Corporation, said that the [use of] mosquito-repellant spray and the
anti-dengue campaign would continue until December 2005, as the corporation
doesn't want to take chances.

The Indian capital Delhi reported 26 mosquito-borne dengue cases with 3 deaths
in the past 2 weeks, Indo-Asian News Service reported Friday.
Out of the 26 cases, 14 were reported from west Delhi, the city government
said.
2 of the 3 that died of dengue came from other places, one from neighboring
Uttar Pradesh and another from southeast India's Andhra Pradesh.
N.K. Yadav, deputy health officer of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD),
said the situation is under control and they are taking all precautions.
So far in 2005 the government has identified 10 326 houses as [sites of
mosquito breeding], compared with some 7000 last year [2004]. And more than
5400 house owners have been prosecuted this year compared to 2035 last year.
The authorities have slapped a fine of 500 rupees (11.49 US dollars) each on
negligent house owners and have decided to fine 2000 rupees (45.98 US dollars)
for repeated offences.
"We have hired 1055 extra workers to help our regular 2500 health workers to
search the houses where mosquito breeding is taking place," he said.

The Kolkata [formerly Calcutta] Municipal Corporation (KMC) figures [differ]
from [those of] the government. While the state health department claims that
4 persons have so far died of dengue, according to an official KMC statement,
only one death has been confirmed. However, this figure has turned out to be
erroneous -- the person said to be dead in the KMC statement is presently
recovering from the disease.
According to a statement issued earlier by member, mayor-in-council (health)
Subodh Dey, a resident of Mahatma Gandhi Road died of dengue yesterday. This
was the only death confirmed by the KMC till Monday.
But the 28-year-old patient in question was found to be recovering at the ICCU
of Apollo Gleneagles Hospital today. "He is far from [being] dead. I attended
to him 5 minutes back, and he is feeling much better than on Monday," said the
attending nurse late this evening..
The basis of "detection" of the number of dengue cases in the city is also
extremely ambiguous. The KMC has set up a health camp at Prince Anwar Shah
Road to conduct blood tests on the hundreds of patients complaining of fever
in wards 93 and 94. The doctor in charge, Amitava Chatterjee, said, "We are
conducting [only] malaria detection tests. We do not have the capability to
detect cases of dengue. Blood samples are taken from us by NICED (National
Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases) and dengue tests are conducted.
This takes about a week.
In the last 2 days, NICED has taken 30 blood samples from this camp".
According to the camp's register, out of 196 people who visited the camp in
the last 2 days, a total of 147 had undergone blood tests. However, only 30 of
these samples have been submitted to NICED. The question is: Why have only a
few samples been submitted to NICED?
Meanwhile, residents of the area are complaining that the outbreak of fever
has been due to the KMC's neglect of sanitary conditions. "Since no toilets
have been provided in the area by the KMC, we have dug several pits next to
our homes," said [one man], whose 20-year-old wife died of suspected dengue.
"Once a pit gets filled, we dig another one," he added. There are 20 such pits
now, and these are areas from which swarms of mosquitos originate.

The Philippines has reported 197 deaths and 14 738 cases of dengue fever this
year, the Department of Health (DOH) said yesterday.
Dr. Eric Tayag of the DOH's National Epidemiology Center said the number of
reported cases amounted to a 20-percent increase over 2004, and that the death
toll had exceeded the 144 registered for 2004.
"The health department placed the Philippines on a dengue fever alert last
week, and this is likely to stay in force for the remainder of the year," he
said.
Tayag said hospitals in some areas have become congested with dengue cases,
but added "we are coping at the moment."
The DOH fears the number of infections could exceed 20 000 by the end of the
year, and has ordered fumigation and other measures to prevent the spread of
the mosquito-transmitted disease in the worst-affected areas, including Metro
Manila.
Health officials have observed a clustering of dengue cases in 117 barangays
[districts] all over the country, prompting them to reiterate calls for a
massive environmental cleanup to eliminate the breeding places of the dengue-
carrying mosquitoes.
The DOH found that there were a clustering of cases in barangays in Manila,
Malabon, Taguig City, Caloocan City, Quezon City, Mandaluyong, Navotas, Pasig
City, Pangasinan, Bulacan, Pampanga, Zambales, Nueva Ecija, Cebu, Cebu City,
Danao City, Toledo City, Misamis Oriental, Cagayan de Oro and Cotabato City.
Clustering means 3 or more people falling ill from dengue in the same barangay
over a period of 4 weeks.
Day-biting _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, which transmit the dengue virus, breed
in clean but stagnant water.
The DOH said schools should conduct cleanup campaigns regularly, because
children usually stay there during most of the day.
The DOH report showed that 43 percent of the 6384 dengue cases affected
children aged 1-9 years. The oldest victim was 95 years old.

The Negros Occidental Provincial Health Office (PHO) reported that there [has
been] an increase in the number of dengue cases in the province [over] the
past months and requested the Regional Health Center for Health Development 6
to deploy an "epidemiological team" to different affected cities and
municipalities to further monitor the case.
Records showed that as of 13 Aug 2005, the number of suspected dengue cases
rose to 51 percent. There [have been] 829 cases recorded [so far in 2005],
while there were 548 cases last year [2004].
The PHO currently conducts larviciding or the application of insecticides in
possible mosquito breeding areas.
The PHO also echoed the call to the city health units, rural health units, and
barangay health units to intensify the environmental sanitation drive and also
for the people in the community to continue cleaning their surroundings.
The larvae of the dengue-carrying mosquito should be killed to prevent the
spread of adult mosquitoes, PHO said.
During 2004, the most number of dengue cases in the province was noted in Bago
City, which had 144 cases. [So far in 2005] it was Talisay City, which had 134
cases. Talisay City recently conducted fogging and larviciding in their area.

The Valenzuela City government has declared a dengue outbreak in the 2nd
district, since 78 percent of 222 people afflicted with the deadly disease in
the city came from the area.
Dr. Manuel Mapue, the city epidemiologist, said 3 victims have already
died. "But this week, we received only 4 additional cases, unlike the previous
weeks," Mapue said.
There are 9 barangays in the 2nd District but only 5 -- Marulas, General T. de
Leon, Karuhatan, Maysan and Ugong -- are being monitored for dengue cases.
Most of the dengue patients in the city were confined at the Valenzuela City
General Hospital, San Lazaro Hospital, Fatima Medical Center and Calalang
General Hospital.
Mapue said the declaration of a dengue outbreak on Monday in the district has
helped in persuading the residents to clean their surroundings and eliminate
breeding grounds of mosquitoes.
"There are initiatives among [the residents] but . . . the city government
helps them. We continue our fumigation activities and spraying [Abate] powder
to kill larvae and eggs," he added.
Last year [2004], Valenzuela had 551 cases of dengue. 3 of the victims died.

Health authorities in St Lucia have placed the island on a dengue alert
following an outbreak of the disease on the neighbouring French island of
Martinique [see (10) below].
Chief Medical Officer Dr Stephen King said the outbreak of dengue has become a
source of concern, with the number of cases being reported to medical
authorities in the recent past.
Martinique has already confirmed 3 cases of the virus, and Dr. King said the
disease could easily reach neighbouring shores with great potential for
spreading.
"Whenever there is an outbreak [in a place frequently visited by travelers,]
it is easy for people to come back and cause an outbreak in their country of
origin, so we need to be very vigilant," he said.
He said that every year the island needs to go on the alert for dengue, but
more so in this period, given the fact that Martinique has reported an
outbreak of the dengue virus type 4.
"We are not saying that St Lucians should cease all travel to Martinique, but
those going there need to be aware of the clear and present danger of being
infected," he said.
St Lucia has recorded 2 major outbreaks of dengue fever with the most recent
being in 2002.
The Ministry of Health has been advising persons against the indiscriminate
disposal of garbage in drains and ravines in an effort to avoid potential
breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
The department has also urged persons experiencing high fevers associated with
headaches and joint pains to seek immediate medical attention.
"We have a surveillance system in place, so that anyone with these symptoms
needs to seek immediate medical attention, and we would want that report to
get to the Ministry so we can implement our control measures," Dr. King said.

A total of 7403 dengue fever cases have been reported in Singapore during the
first 8 months of [2005], Channel NewsAsia report said on Wednesday.
The number for the corresponding period of [2004] was 3782.
The city-state has seen an upward trend in the number of [cases of] the
disease in recent years, with a total of 9459 cases being found last year
[2004], almost doubling the 4788 cases in 2003.
To tackle the problem, the National Environment Agency (NEA) has allocated
another 7.5 million Singapore dollars (about 4.5 million US dollars) to flush
the drains, adding to the yearly 2.5 million Singapore dollars (about 1.5
million US dollars).
Drains, pump rooms and water tanks, as well as flower vases, plant pot plates
and watering cans at home are identified as the most likely mosquito breeding
sources.
Having hired some 360 field inspectors so far, up from 110 last year, the NEA
will recruit 150 more in the next 2 months and urge town councils to hire
dedicated pest control operators to do more flushing of the drains, fogging
and clearing of the breeding sites.
Last month [July 2005], the agency announced that it would put up posters at
bus stops and Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations, as well as distributing new
sets of dengue educational kits to 70 000 families, to strengthen its
prevention measures.

Dengue fever figures reported for this year in Quintana Roo exceed by 200
percent the number of cases detected in 2004; consequently, health authorities
started emergency programs for land and air insecticide spraying, as well as
placing Abate in water tanks and promoting the "clean yards" campaign.
Jose Joaquin Calderon-Martinez, state director of health services, announced
that by epidemiological week No. 32, they have reported 336 cases of dengue
fever.
250 of the cases correspond to the classic form and 86 are dengue hemorrhagic
fever; these figures exceed by far the number of cases reported for the same
time in 2004, when the total number of cases was 139, 113 with classic dengue
fever and 26 with dengue hemorrhagic fever.
[City] councils with the greatest numbers of dengue fever cases are Othon P.
Blanco (210 cases), Benito Juarez (100 cases), and Felipe Carrillo-Puerto (18
cases). The remaining communities report 1-2 cases.
"The objective is to reduce mosquito proliferation, especially since Mexico
City is surrounded by an 80-hectare savannah, well-suited to larvae breeding",
affirmed Mr. Calderon-Martinez.
After Hurricane Emily, which hit the area on 18 Jul 2005, health authorities
received funds from Fonden [Mexico's Fund for Natural Disasters] for an
emergency program aiming to control and combat dengue, specifically for
fumigating actions all over the state and placing Abate in household water
tanks.
In Tamaulipas, 928 cases of dengue fever and 129 cases of dengue hemorrhagic
fever have been reported. The State Health Secretariat intensified actions for
fighting the mosquito vector, through aerial fumigation actions in the most
affected areas and land brigades in 11 city councils.
The dengue outbreak in Tamaulipas urged the Government of Nuevo Leon to
initiate a program for vehicle fumigation in the border areas between the 2
states.
Subsecretary for Disease Prevention and Control from Nuevo Leon Health
Secretariat, Mr. Ricardo Huerta-Gallega, [stated in a telephone interview]
that in the first 2 days of this campaign, 2091 fumigations have been
performed in a similar number of vehicles: 1401 in private cars, 612 in
trucks, and 78 in buses.
During the current epidemiological week [3rd week August 2005], 1135 dengue
fever cases were diagnosed; 69 (6.1 percent) of them were dengue hemorrhagic
fever cases. The ratio of dengue fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever of 15:1.
Cumulative case figures for the year [2005] are 20 323 cases, of which 6.3
percent (1278 cases) are of the hemorrhagic form, with the ratio of dengue
fever to dengue hemorrhagic fever of 15:1. The cumulative morbidity rate is
76.5 per 100 000 inhabitants.
Circulating serotypes are 1 and 3. The cumulative case toll for the period
increased by 1.9 percent as compared to the total cumulative number of cases
by the same date [3rd week August] last year [2004].
In the current epidemiological week [3rd week August 2005], no deaths from
dengue have been reported.
A 2.3 percent increase in the number of cases as compared to last week [2nd
week August 2005] was reported, so the situation is considered to be an
epidemic.
52 percent of reported cases are in the less-than-15-year-old age group; 21.5
percent of cases are in the 15-to-24-year-old age group. Federal areas that
reported the highest case tolls are: Carabobo (240), Apure (144), Mida (135),
Barinas (89), and Thira (77).

Situation in the French Antilles [as of 25 Aug 2005]
Guadeloupe
----------
Since June 2005, the available dengue epidemiological surveillance data reveal
a steady increase in the number of cases reported each week.
Epidemic onset was identified as the beginning of July, after the daily
epidemic threshold of suspected dengue cases had been exceeded for 2
consecutive weeks, as determined by the sentinel physician network.
Between 1 Jun and 24 Aug 2005, the network of city sentinel physicians
reported 331 suspected clinical cases. Among the 403 diagnostic requests
prescribed by island physicians, 183 cases had been confirmed by biological
analyses.
The serotypes DEN-3 and DEN-4 had been identified. The communities most
affected were those in the south of Basse-Terre, as well as those on St.
Martin island. During the past 2 weeks, extension has begun into communities
adjoining the initial sites (Basse-Terre, Gourbeyre, Saint-Claude and Baillif)
and, to a lesser degree, into the communities of northern Basse Terre (Pointe
Noire) and on Grande Terre (Abymes, Gosier, Sainte-Anne, Morne l'eau).
Martinique
----------
The threshold for the seasonal recurrence of dengue was reached in mid-June
[2005], earlier than is normal, and the epidemic threshold had been exceeded
by mid-July 2005. Between 1 Jun and 24 Aug 2005, the network of sentinel city
physicians reported 405 suspected cased of dengue.
Among the 845 diagnostic requests prescribed by island physicians, 350 cases
had been confirmed by biological analyses (serology and by reverse
transcriptase PCR).
This epidemic is linked to co-circulation of serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-4. The
latter predominates and represents 70 percent of the actual isolates from 2005
(from the 58 serotypes detected since January 2005, there are 41 DEN-4, 16 DEN-
2, and only one DEN-3).
Extrapolating from the sentinel network data, one can estimate that, since the
beginning of the epidemic, between 1500 and 2000 people have been infected in
Martinique.
The serotypes DEN-2 and DEN-4 have been identified. The communities most
affected are centrally located (Fort de France, Lamentin, Saint-Joseph, and
Schoelcher), certain localities in the south (Riviere Pilote, Marin, and
Francois) and north (Trinite and Basse Pointe).
Even though it is difficult to foresee the magnitude of this epidemic in terms
of the number of infected individuals, [considering] the evolutionary duration
and geographical extension, the types of circulating viruses and the current
climatic conditions are favorable for continued development and expansion in
both departments (Guadeloupe and Martinique).
