Taiwan is currently in the peak season for Japanese encephalitis, with 5 new cases confirmed around the country recently, according to a statement issued Tuesday [7 Jul 2020] by the [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

From 16 Jun to 2 Jul [2020], 5 people in their 40s and 50s were confirmed as infected with the disease, with one case each in Changhua, Chiayi, and Kaohsiung, and 2 in Taoyuan, according to the CDC.

The patients developed symptoms of fever, headache, an unsteady gait, dysarthria, neck stiffness, irritation and altered levels of consciousness, the CDC said, adding that the 5 patients have been hospitalized and are undergoing treatment.

The 5 had been working or living in areas near pig pens, pigeon coops, or paddy fields, which are considered high risk for the transmission of Japanese encephalitis [virus] since they are prime breeding grounds for the mosquito that carries the virus.

The confirmation of the 5 most recent cases brings the total number for the year to 9, including 2 each in Taoyuan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung and one each in Changhua, Chiayi, and Tainan.

From 2016-2019, Taiwan recorded 9, 16, 31, and 13 cases of Japanese encephalitis, respectively, with most of the patients in their 40s, CDC data shows.

In Taiwan, Japanese encephalitis is usually prevalent from May to October and peaks between June and July. The disease is mainly transmitted by the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito, which is known to breed in rice fields, ponds, and irrigation canals.

The CDC has advised the public to avoid visiting such places and farms, especially at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active and to make sure children are vaccinated against the disease.

If visiting the areas is unavoidable, people are urged to use a government-approved mosquito repellent and wear light-colored clothing that covers most of the body.

[The Japanese encephalitis transmission season in Taiwan is well underway with a total of 9 cases so far this season. More cases can be expected. The mosquito species, _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_, and other related _Culex_ species are efficient vectors of JEV and breed in wet areas such as rice paddies. These _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people. Vector control is difficult. JE is a vaccine-preventable disease. It is not stated whether the affected individual above had been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
