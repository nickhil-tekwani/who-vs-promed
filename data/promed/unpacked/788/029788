A New York snack food maker is recalling about 3 million pounds of frozen pizza, mozzarella bites, Philly cheese steaks and other products linked to a rare and potentially dangerous outbreak of _E. coli_ infection.

Rich Products Corp. of Buffalo, NY is pulling all products manufactured at its Waycross, Georgia plant. The snacks have best buy dates from 1 Jan 2013 through 29 Sep 2014, according to a press release.

The foods may be contaminated with the bacterium _E. coli_ O121, which already has sickened 24 people in 15 states who ate certain Farm Rich and Market Day frozen chicken quesadillas, pizza slices and other snack foods; 7 people have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.

However, many more people may have been made ill by the products without knowing it because of complexities involved in identifying _E. coli_ O121, a strain that can be just as dangerous as the better-known _E. coli_ O157:H7 frequently tied to outbreaks.

The announcement expands a 28 Mar 2013 recall of 196 222 pounds of Farm Rich brand frozen chicken quesadillas and other frozen mini meals and snack items because they could be contaminated with _E. coli_ O121.

In 2011, US Department of Agriculture officials banned _E. coli_ O121 and 5 other strains -- known as "the big 6" -- from the nation's beef supply. This outbreak is the 1st time Food Safety and Inspection Service officials have recalled products potentially tainted with _E. coli_ O121.

The particular strain involved in this outbreak is so rare that its genetic fingerprint has been seen less than 30 times in PulseNet, the CDC's network of laboratories that track bacteria involved in foodborne illness.

The New York State Department of Health identified the outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O121 in an opened package of Farm Rich brand frozen mini chicken and cheese quesadillas from an ill person's home, the CDC said.
