[Below is the official text to OIE from Dr. Torres. It contains a few
additional details over and above the excellent earlier posting from
Patrick Halbur referenced above. The outstanding questions at this point -
how did these bunnies get the virus and will we ever know the genesis of
the outbreak? - Mod.PC

Text of a fax received on 12 April 2000 from Dr Alfonso Torres, Deputy
Administrator, Veterinary Services, United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), Washington, DC:
Report date: 10 Apr 2000.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, postmortem and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 31 Mar 2000.
Estimated date of first infection: 7 Mar 2000.
Description of affected population: all rabbits on the affected premises,
which is in a rural location, were being raised for the purposes of
exhibition. They were all Palominos or California Whites.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible 27
cases 25
deaths 25
destroyed 2
slaughtered 0

Diagnosis:
- The first rabbit, one allowed to roam near the house, died on 9 Mar 2000.
- Rabbits housed in hutches started dying on 16 March.
- On 22 March, a private veterinarian forwarded samples to Iowa State
University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease
(RHD) or toxic hepatopathy was suspected based on the clinical history and
microscopic lesions in the liver.
- On 24 March, a second rabbit was submitted with similar lesions.
- The State and Federal offices were notified on 27 March and a foreign
animal disease investigation began immediately. Epidemiological information
was collected and samples were sent to the USDA's Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL), Orient Point, State of New York.
- On 31 March FADDL tentatively diagnosed RHD based on haemagglutination
test on liver homogenate from inoculated rabbits and electron microscopy.
- FADDL forwarded samples to the National Institute for Agrarian Research
(INIA), Madrid, Spain, for confirmation.
- Confirmation of RHD was received from INIA on 7 April, based on
polymerase chain reaction tests.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: despite extensive investigations,
the source of the introduction of the virus onto the site has not yet been
identified.
B. Mode of spread: spread has been confined to one premises. Spread on that
premises has been by close contact with infected rabbits and indirect
spread by materials contaminated with virus is also suspected.
C. Other epidemiological details:
- There have been no introductions of rabbits onto the premises for the
last two years.
- The first week of August 1999 was the last time rabbits left the farm and
returned.
- In January 2000, six rabbits, all healthy and over two months old, were
sold.
Control measures during reporting period:
- The affected premises are quarantined by the State authority.
- The State authority destroyed the remaining two rabbits on 8 Apr 2000.
- Cleaning and disinfection will be controlled by the State authority.
- Premises with rabbits in the near vicinity are being located, and owners
are being contacted to determine whether similar circumstances have
occurred elsewhere.
