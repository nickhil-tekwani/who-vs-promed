Anthrax among heroin users in Europe possibly caused by same _Bacillus anthracis_ strain since 2000
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Grunow R, Klee SR, Beyer W, et al]

Abstract
--------
Injection anthrax was described 1st in 2000 in a heroin-injecting drug user in Norway. New anthrax cases among heroin consumers were detected in the United Kingdom (52 cases) and Germany (3 cases) in 2009-10. In June 2012, a fatal case occurred in Regensburg, Bavaria. As of December 2012, 13 cases had been reported in this new outbreak from Germany, Denmark, France, and the United Kingdom. We analysed isolates from 2009-10 and 2012 as well as from the 1st injection anthrax case in Norway in 2000 by comparative molecular typing using a high resolution 31 marker multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and a broad single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Our results show that all cases may be traced back to the same outbreak strain. They also indicate the probability of a single source contaminating heroin and that the outbreak could have lasted for at least a decade. However, an additional serological pilot study in 2 German regions conducted in 2011 failed to discover additional anthrax cases among 288 heroin users.

[Concluding paragraph of discussion] In conclusion, high resolution MLVA31 and SNP13 plus a cascade of SNP analyses and 2 very specific SNPs identified all studied isolates from the anthrax outbreak in IDUs [injecting drug users] in 2009-10 and 2012 as the same strain. Most interestingly, the Norwegian isolate from the year 2000 was also identified by all applied methods as the same outbreak strain. It can be concluded that most likely the outbreak has been going on since at least the year 2000 with a highly probable similar source of contamination which might be still active. It seems probable that cases have remained undetected since this time and a joint international epidemiological investigation could contribute to clarify this issue. Identification and abolishment of the contamination source would be the most effective preventive measure. However, this is a challenge that could be only achieved by close cooperation of scientists, public health authorities and law enforcement agencies. Awareness by physicians and patients is most important for an early and effective treatment.

[Members interested in these European outbreaks of human anthrax associated with contaminated heroin are strongly encouraged to read the full article. It is a valuable paper and confirms earlier statements on the genomic consistency of the recovered strains. However the paper would have been much stronger if it had collaboratively included the genomic analyses of the recovered isolates associated with the UK infections. Inquiries in this regard have failed to solicit any replies. This information would have helped better clarify a number of questions.

The cases across Europe are so scattered as to make it difficult to see any epidemiologic pattern, while the UK had more than its share of these cases. Thus the importance of the true genomic identity of the UK cases in relation to the cases to the east.

For example, the distribution of later cases in Europe is not consistent with the known drug trafficking routes. The UK is usually an end distribution, not a source point for distribution back into Europe. It is difficult to account for the distribution of cases across Europe over this 10 year period, unless whoever was responsible was themselves moving around Europe seeding supply networks.

At the moment speculation would have this long time consistent strain contamination associated with a singular heroin processing group in the Near East or Turkey. How this could be is unclear. If any future cases are also linked to the same "strain" I think "accidental" contamination as part of normal drug processing as an explanation will become increasingly questionable. Part of the answer may lie in how the 1st Norwegian contamination came about and the long delay until the multiple cases in the UK. - Mod.MHJ]
