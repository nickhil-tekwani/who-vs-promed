Translation of the summary of an e-mail received on 16 Aug 2000 from Dr
Oscar Alejandro Bruni, President of the National Service of Agrifood Health
and Quality (SENASA), Secretariat for Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and
Food, Buenos Aires:
End of previous report period: 8 Aug 2000 (see Disease Information, 13
[30, 117, dated 11 Aug 2000).
End of this report period: 14 Aug 2000.
Diagnostic tests and causal agent:
Prior to slaughter, samples (serum and oesophageal-pharyngeal liquid) were
taken from the animals that had entered the country illegally.
The result of serological testing were as follows:
- VIAA(1): four reactors.
- EITB(2): confirmation of the reaction in these four animals.
- Probang test (technique used to isolate animals carrying the foot and
mouth disease [FMD virus): in one of the samples a cytopathic effect was
observed during the third passage in BHK-clone 21 cells.
The suspended cellular particles were examined using the following techniques:
- Typing and subtyping using the ELISA technique (Pan American Foot and
Mouth Disease Centre Â– CPFA): FMD virus type A.
This was corroborated using:
- Typing and sub-typing by 50% complement fixation: strong evidence of FMD
virus type A24.
- Characterisation of the immunogenic profile with panels of monoclonal
antibodies developed against all of the South American strains of FMD virus
and mono-specific hyper immune sera: compatible with the A24 virus.
- Sequencing of genomic RNA is under way.
Comment: No field strain compatible with A24 has ever been isolated or
diagnosed in Argentina, and it can therefore be unequivocally deduced that
it is exotic in nature.
Control measures:
To date, due to adverse weather conditions, only 842 animals in the
communally owned establishment in the Province of Formosa have been
destroyed out of a total of 1308 animals on this property, belonging to 22
different livestock owners.
Continuing the tasks of isolation, prophylaxis and disinfection, a total of
1546 bovines were destroyed in the establishment in the Province of
Corrientes and 709 bovines in the establishment of Entre Rios, thereby
covering all of the susceptible animals in these establishments and the
cattle that were introduced.
At no time were any clinical signs of FMD identified during the health
inspections and implementation of the sanitary measures.
The destinations of the 12 consignments out of the total of 13 consignments
that left the communally-owned property and surrounding area were as
follows: Corrientes (3 consignments totalling 34 bovines); Santa Fe (5
consignments totalling 173 bovines), Chaco (3 consignments totalling 80
bovines) and Santiago del Estero (1 consignment of 100 bovines). All 387 of
these bovines tested negative to all of the serological tests. They have
all been placed in quarantine prior to undergoing a new battery of
diagnostic tests. Disinfection and quarantine measures have been applied in
all of these establishments on a preventive basis.
In the rest of the country, in order to sample and monitor all of the herds
that have left the surveillance zone, movement restrictions have been
placed on cattle due to be sent to winter accommodation, with effect from
11 Aug 2000. In compliance with the sanitary measures, the only movements
currently authorised are to the abattoir, for immediate slaughter.
In the surveillance zone intensive livestock controls are being continued.
Serological monitoring is in progress in the region and in the remainder of
the country.
(1) VIAA: virus infection associated antigen.
(2) EITB: electroimmunotransfer blot.

[It is particularly noteworthy that the FMD virus strain A24 is declared
exotic to Argentina and there are no clinical signs in Argentinean animals.
Is anyone making efforts to trace the virus back to the country of origin?
