A section of the Cherry Creek Regional Trail [Colorado] has been closed because of plague. The disease was found in a nearby prairie dog colony. A trail is closed at the Hungry Horse Open Space from Scott Road to a spot 1.4 miles [2.25 km] north of Scott Road. Access from the north Pinery Parkway trailhead is also closed.

Douglas County staff said they found evidence of plague during a routine inspection and that Tri-County Health Department will be treating the property over the next few days. The trail is expected to be closed through [14 Nov 2016].

Plague is transmitted predominantly by the bite of infected fleas, but can also be transmitted through infected body fluids, according to Douglas County.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Humans are at risk of becoming infected if they are exposed to rodent fleas. - Mod.PMB
