According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission [FWC], samples collected in January [2022] by USDA-Wildlife Services from a hunter-harvested blue-winged teal in Palm Beach County have tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] strain: H5N1 2.3.4.4b Eurasian. This follows similar reports of the H5N1 Eurasian strain from South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, and Canada (Newfoundland and Labrador) this past fall and winter (2021-2022).

This strain has been documented in Europe since early 2021. No known human infections with Eurasian H5 viruses have occurred in the United States.

The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS] says these findings are not unexpected, as wild birds can be infected with HPAI and show no signs of illness. They can carry the disease to new areas when migrating. APHIS anticipates additional wild bird findings as robust wild bird sampling program continues into the spring.

FWC is monitoring for HPAI in birds found sick or dead of unknown causes and highlights ways to help prevent HPAI spread:
- Report bird mortalities so die-offs can be investigated and tested.
- Prevent contact of domestic or captive birds with wild birds (especially waterfowl).
- Do not handle sick/dead wildlife. If it is necessary to do so then wear impermeable gloves, wash hands with soap and water, and change clothing before having any contact with healthy domestic poultry and birds.
- Hunters and others handling birds should follow routine precautions listed below when handling wild birds.

[This new report from Florida attests to the spread of Eurasian HPAI H5 viruses are spreading in North America, previously reported in Nova Scotia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia.

From 2014 onwards, HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses caused outbreaks across the Eurasian region, affecting both poultry and wild birds, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. So far, the subtype reported in the Americas is H5N1.

Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in the HPAI epidemic. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. Numerous species of birds that migrate along Nearctic and Palearctic flyways breed in Arctic tundra regions, providing opportunities for HPAI viruses to be introduced into another continent. Thus, the migration of those species could have been the cause of the introduction of HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 into the Americas. - Mod.PMB
