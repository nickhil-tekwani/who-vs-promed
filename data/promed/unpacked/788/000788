The Oregon Health Authority's Public Health Division is confirming a case of bubonic plague in a teenage Crook County girl. The girl is believed to have acquired the disease from a flea bite during a hunting trip near Heppner in Morrow County on 18 Oct 2015. She reportedly fell ill 3 days later and was hospitalized in Bend the same day. She is recovering in the hospital's intensive care unit.

Oregon Public Health and the CDC epidemiologists are working with health officials in Crook, Deschutes, and Morrow counties to investigate the illness. No other persons are believed to have been infected.

"Many people think of the plague as a disease of the past, but it's still very much present in our environment, particularly among wildlife," said Emilio DeBess, DVM, state public health veterinarian in the Public Health Division's Acute and Communicable Disease Prevention Section. "Fortunately, plague remains a rare disease, but people who may come in contact with wildlife still need to take precautions to keep it that way."

DeBess recommends people avoid any contact with wild rodents. They should never feed squirrels, chipmunks, or other rodents in picnic or campground areas, and never touch sick or dead rodents. Pets also should be protected from fleas and kept away from wild animals.

Plague is rare in Oregon and is treatable with antimicrobials if caught early. Only 8 human cases have been diagnosed in the state since 1995.
