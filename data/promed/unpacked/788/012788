The Council of Agriculture (COA) confirmed [Tue 12 Jan 2016] that a pigeon was found to be infected with the new H5 subtype of the avian influenza virus, the 1st time that the highly pathogenic subtype had been detected in [this] bird species in Taiwan.

A pigeon found dead on the roof of the home of a resident in Taipei's Wenshan district tested positive for the H5 subtype according to the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.

The case followed another one in Taichung's Situn District, where 2 dead sparrows picked up by a local resident tested positive on 8 Jan 2016 for the H5 subtype.

Between 15 Jan 2015 and 12 Jan 2016, Taiwan reported 17 cases of infection by various strains of the bird flu virus in wild birds, including 5 cases in non-migratory birds and 9 cases in migratory birds, the bureau said.
