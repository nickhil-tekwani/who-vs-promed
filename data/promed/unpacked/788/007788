EPIDEMIC ALERT - COLOMBIA

In Medellin, the secretary of Social Security in the Health Department of
Medellin, Felipe Aguirre Arias, issued a warning against against cholera as
well as dengue and malaria in the city. Health authorities are trying to
avoid a health emergency like the one in Medellin in 1995 when 768 cases
of classic dengue were recorded, 7 of which were diagnosed as hemorrhagic
dengue.
In the last two months, the existence of one case of hemorrhagic dengue has
been confirmed in the neighborhood of San Cristobal, west of the city, and
currently under review is the case of 37 year old woman who lived in the
neighborhood of Santo Domingo, a northeastern area, who died in less than
24 hours with symptoms similar to those of hemorrhagic dengue.
In addition, an epidemic of hemorrhagic dengue was reported by health
authorities in the Department of Santander after some 20 cases were
reported in various health centers and hospitals of the metropolitan area
of Bucaramanga in the last ten days.
An increase in the number of cholera cases to 110 was reported in Norte de
Santander, a number without precedence in this department, where last year
only 3 cases were confirmed. The majority of the cases are found in La
Parada where the epidemic started five days ago, when the first fatality was
reported. A few isolated cases from other areas of Villa del Rosario have
also been reported.
"95% of the cases are located in La Parada, especially on the river bank,
where the population drinks water from subterranean wells because there is
no aqueduct. The other cases are in Lomitas and the neighborhood of
Santander, but all have contact with La Parada", said the chief of
epidemiology of the Erasmo Meoz hospital in Cucuta, Oscar Chavez.
Before the alert, health authorities had requested from the Government
supplies of antibiotics and intravenous fluids with the goal of controlling
dehydration of patients, most of whom are in Erasmo Meoz hospital.
