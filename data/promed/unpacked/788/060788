CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states and the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] to investigate a multistate outbreak of salmonellosis. This outbreak is caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B variant L(+) tartrate(+) bacteria, formerly known as _Salmonella_ Java. People with illness caused by this bacteria typically experience diarrhea, fever, and abdominal cramps 12-72 hours after an exposure. _S._ Paratyphi B variant L(+) tartrate(+) does not cause paratyphoid fever, enteric fever, or typhoid fever.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories, is coordinated by CDC. DNA 'fingerprinting' is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using a technique called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. One DNA fingerprint (outbreak strain) is included in this outbreak investigation. The outbreak strain is new to the PulseNet database.

A total of 11 people infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Paratyphi B variant L(+) tartrate(+) have been reported from 9 states as of 2 Dec 2015. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: California (1), Colorado (1), Georgia (1), Hawaii (1), Idaho (1), Illinois (1), North Carolina (1), New Jersey (1), and Oregon (3).

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 18 Jul 2015 to 15 Oct 2015. Ill people range in age from 1 year to 79, with a median age of 48. 64 percent of ill people are male. Among 9 ill people with available information, none reported being hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the Outbreak
-----------------------------
The epidemiologic evidence available at this time indicates that JEM Raw brand sprouted nut butter spreads are the likely source of this outbreak. The recalled nut butter products have a long shelf life and may still be in people's homes, restaurants, and grocery stores, and illnesses may continue to be reported.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before they became ill. All 8 ill people interviewed (100 percent) reported exposure to a nut butter or nut butter spread in the week before illness onset, and 6 (75 percent) of these people specifically reported exposure to a JEM Raw brand sprouted nut spread.

On 2 Dec 2015, JEM Raw Chocolate, LLC of Bend, Oregon, voluntarily recalled its entire line of sprouted nut butter spreads because of potential contamination with _Salmonella_. The nut butter spreads were distributed nationwide in retail stores and through mail order. The recall affects all flavors of sprouted nut butter spreads sold by JEM Raw. The products were sold in glass jars in sizes ranging from 1.25 ounces to 16 ounces.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods they ate before they become ill.

JEM Raw Chocolate, LLC (JEM Raw) of Bend, Oregon announced a voluntary recall of its full line of all nut butter spreads within expiry because it has the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with _Salmonella_ often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. In rare circumstances, infection with _Salmonella_ can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.

Health authorities, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Oregon Health Authority (OHA), Oregon Department of Agriculture (ODA), and Center for Disease Control (CDC), have linked the illnesses to person(s) who have consumed nut spreads, including JEM Raw products. There have been 11 illnesses reported but no deaths or hospitalizations to date.

In light of this investigation, and with an abundance of caution, JEM Raw has initiated a voluntary recall of all products and sizes, packaged in glass jars, and sold under brand name JEM Raw Organics.

The following products are recalled:

JEM Raw is working with distributors and retailers to remove these products from retail shelves. Consumers do not need to return the product to the store where it was purchased. Instead, consumers should discard any product and its container. JEM Raw will work directly with each consumer to manage replacement of its product.

[This organism has well characterized animal reservoirs and has been involved in a number of relatively recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail (refer to "See Also"). Additionally, salmonellosis has been specifically linked to nut butters as reported in Salmonellosis - USA (09): nut butters, alert, recall, st Braenderup 20140822.2713336; and Salmonellosis, st Stanley - USA: cashew nut spread 20140111.2164774.

This organism behaves more like the usual zoonotic salmonellosis as opposed to _S._ Typhi and other _S._ Paratyphi species which present usually as an "enteric fever," a longer illness mostly linked to fever without much diarrhea. - Mod.LL
