Bovine TB found in feral wild boar
----------------------------------
Bovine tuberculosis (TB) has spread to Britain's feral wild boar
population, DEFRA has announced. Tests on a 60kg [132 pounds] female
boar in Herefordshire revealed tissue lesions consistent with the disease.

The boar was trapped as part of a research project which was being
carried about by the Food and Environment Research Agency. The animal
died while under anaesthetic and was sent for post-mortem where the
disease was identified.

A DEFRA spokesman said that the incident did not change the
department's risk assessment for the disease. "The risk to domestic
livestock, wild animals and public health from _M bovis_ infection in
wild boar remains low and this isolated incident does not alter our
assessment. The main risk of human _M bovis_ infection arising from
wild boar is probably occupational, for those handling live infected
animals or their carcasses in the field."

The wild boar joins the growing list of non-bovine hosts for the
disease. The disease has been found in farmed wild boar twice while
cases in cats, dogs, pigs and camelids, although still low, appear to
be increasing.

Fewer than 1 percent of human TB cases are thought to be linked to
bovine TB infections.

[A previous TB case in a wild boar from Herefordshire was described
in posting 20100319.0879. It related to 'lesions consistent with TB'
in a boar from the Ross-on-Wye area. Or was that the same animal?!. - Mod.AS]
