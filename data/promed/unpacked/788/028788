CDC Request for Information on Laboratory-Acquired Meningococcal Disease
-------------------------------------------------
The Meningitis and Special Pathogens Branch, NCID, CDC has recently been
notified of 2 fatal cases of serogroup C meningococcal disease in clinical
laboratory workers in the past 6 months.
The illnesses were apparently acquired through contact with body fluid
positive for meningococcus [_Neisseria meningitidis_]. A review of the
literature suggests that laboratory-acquired meningococcal infection is
rare, with 11 cases being documented in the world literature since 1979
(1-5) [References not included].
The number of laboratory-acquired infections may be underestimated since
many cases may not appear in the published literature and reports to health
departments may not indicate that infections were acquired in the
laboratory. Current recommendations for the prevention of meningococcal
infection in laboratory workers are available at:
<ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4605.pdf >; however, the
specific recommendations regarding the handling of meningococcal samples
are vague and as such may not be understood by all laboratorians, nor
implemented in all laboratories in a uniform manner.
We are interested in ascertaining a more accurate estimate of the frequency
of laboratory-acquired meningococcal infection. If you are aware of any
such cases in the past 15 years, we would greatly appreciate additional
information. Your time and effort in this regard are greatly appreciated.
If you are aware of a laboratory-acquired case of meningococcal disease in
the past 15 years, please contact Dr. Jim Sejvar as indicated below. Please
respond by Monday, 15 Jan 2001 and indicate that you are responding from
ProMED-mail.

[Although this RFI refers to exposures to body fluids, it would seem that
laboratory exposure to meningococcal cultures derived from those fluids or
from other sources may also be hazardous. It is doubtful that laboratory
exposures will emerge as a problem of great significance against a
background of potential exposure to nasopharyngeal carriers in the general
population. However, since meningococcal polysaccharide vaccines are
available, it may be worthwhile to carefully assess the occupational risk
of processing laboratory specimens. Such an assessment may require a more
systematic study than this RFI approach will provide. - Mods.ES/DS]
