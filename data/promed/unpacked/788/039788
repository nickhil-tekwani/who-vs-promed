Egypt: Avian Influenza Situation
-------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Egypt has confirmed the country's 1st case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred in a
30-year-old woman from the Gaiubia governorate near Cairo. She developed
symptoms in early March 2006 following close contact with diseased
chickens, ducks, and a turkey in the household flock. She was hospitalized
on 16 Mar 2006 and died the following day. Monitoring of the woman's family
members and close contacts has found no signs of influenza-like illness.
Testing was conducted by the US Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-3),
which is based in Cairo. Samples are being sent abroad for diagnostic
verification and further analysis by a WHO collaborating laboratory. WHO
will adjust the figures in its cumulative number of cases following the
results of this external verification.
Egypt confirmed its 1st H5N1 outbreak in poultry on 17 Feb 2006. The virus
has since been reported in 18 of the country's 26 governorates. In Egypt,
poultry are often kept in close proximity to households, also in urban areas.

Malaysia: Farmer May Have Had Avian Influenza
-----------------------------------------------
A poultry farmer whose free-range chickens died from H5N1 virus infection
is believed to have suffered from symptoms related to avian influenza. The
farmer said a doctor he consulted for cough and body itch last week had
diagnosed him as having contracted "a type of bird flu virus."
The 34-year-old farmer, from Kampung Changkat Tualang in Kota Baru near
here, said he was also suffering loss of appetite. "During the time I was
ill, I realized that a few of my chickens were dying each day," he said
yesterday [16 Mar 2006] when officers from the state Veterinary Services
Department began culling the chickens at his farm. "I was alarmed when 12
of my chickens died on Monday [13 Mar 2006], and I contacted the police."
The farmer, who lives behind his farm, said the veterinary officers also
conducted tests the next day after the police informed the department about
the dead birds. "On Wednesday [15 Mar 2006], the department confirmed that
my chickens had died of the H5N1 virus," he said.
The farmer said about 80 villagers living in the area also reared poultry
for a living. "Their birds have also been dying since last week," he added.

[This case, if confirmed, would be the 1st human case of avian H5N1
influenza virus infection reported from Malaysia. The evidence for
infection is tenuous, however. It appears to be based on symptomology
without support from laboratory testing.
