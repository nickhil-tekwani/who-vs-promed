Saudi Arabia says a man has died from [MERS-CoV], a respiratory virus related to SARS, bringing to 63 the deaths in the kingdom at the centre of the outbreak.

The Health Ministry said Friday [14 Mar 2014] the latest victim, a 19-year-old, died in the city of Al Kharj, southeast of Riyadh. Two of his sisters are in hospital as they are suspected to have been infected with the virus.

So far, 150 people have been infected in the kingdom since September 2012.

The new virus is related to SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which killed some 800 people in a global outbreak in 2003. It belongs to a family of viruses that most often causes the common cold.

[From the above newswire in [2] it appears as though the 2 mildly symptomatic cases confirmed in the MOH report in [1] are family members of the fatal case reported today (14 Mar 2014). It is unclear if the other 2 cases reported today (the 83-year-old in intensive care and the 53-year-old asymptomatic contact) are part of the same cluster or if they are unrelated to the 19-year-old male reported today. More information on these cases, including history of travel or history of exposure to animals, would be greatly appreciated, as well as dates of onset of disease in the symptomatic cases and date of death of the fatal case.

According to the most recent global tally of laboratory-confirmed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections reported by WHO provided in the 12 Mar 2014 update, there have been a total of 189 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 82 deaths. This tally does not include information on a 55-year-old male from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia reported on the Saudi MOH website on 5 Mar 2014 and in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (12): Saudi Arabia 20140306.2317828; and the asymptomatic infection in the 86-year-old male contact of a confirmed case, reported by the MOH on 6 Mar 2014 and in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (13): Saudi Arabia, UAE, WHO 20140313.2330878. With the addition of these 2 cases and the 5 cases contained in the above MOH report, the global tally will be 196 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 83 deaths, of which 156 cases including 63 deaths have been reported by Saudi Arabia.
