Southern virus may be killing deer in northwest Cook County
-----------------------------------------------------------
Heat, drought likely to blame for suspected outbreak, unprecedented in Chicago area; Michigan, Indiana among other Northern states have been affected. A recently deceased deer lies in the Poplar Creek Forest Preserve in Cook County on Tuesday [21 Aug 2012]. The unfortunate doe was probably felled by epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, a virus more typically restricted to lower latitudes.
The deer had cut through the woods, seeking water to cool the fever engulfing their bodies. Weak and in a state of shock, they laid down by a lake. Despite their outwardly healthy appearances -- no gunshot wounds or obvious injuries -- they died there within hours, victims of a disease that's killing scores of deer in Cook County forest preserves.

The discovery of the 3 white-tailed deer carcasses Tuesday afternoon at Poplar Creek Forest Preserve near Hoffman Estates raised the tally of dead deer found in similar condition in northwestern Cook County in the last week or so to about 70. The animals are believed to be victims of a virus that is common in other parts of the country, including Downstate, but almost unheard of in northern Illinois -- epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD. The outbreak has prompted numerous calls from hikers in local woods alarmed to find groups of dead deer. Officials at the Forest Preserve District of Cook County assured the public that no one is poisoning the animals and that the disease is not transmittable to humans -- but it can devastate local deer herds. It's already claimed more deer locally than another infection, chronic wasting disease, killed statewide last year.

"This is the 1st time it's ever occurred here," Cook County wildlife biologist Chris Anchor said. "It's a pretty special set of circumstances. "EHD is believed to have been around for more than a century, but the emergence of cases in various parts of the country could result in the worst outbreak since the record-setting numbers of 2007, said Kip Adams, wildlife biologist for the Quality Deer Management Association.

"It's setting the stage to be a really terrible year," Adams said. "It used to be talked about more as a Southern disease. But in the last several years, it's amazing how the Northern states have had far worse outbreaks than ever before."

An outbreak in Michigan has killed about 1000 deer there in about 3 weeks, according to the state's Natural Resources Department. Cases are also suspected in Indiana. While there have been isolated cases of EHD in Will and southern Cook counties, the spread of the disease is believed to be a product of this year's drought and heat.

The lack of rainfall drives deer to congregate near fewer remaining waterways and wetlands, where they can be bitten by a midge, the small flying insect that transmits the illness.

Naturalists say EHD is marked by its rapid onset, within days or even hours of exposure. An infected deer will typically lose its appetite and its fear of humans, become feverish and weak and drool, and its heart rate and breathing will speed up. The deer will often seek out a pond or stream in which to cool off, then go into shock, lose consciousness and die of internal bleeding, often in or near water.

The local EHD strain seems to be particularly virulent. Local deer may be especially vulnerable, since they have not developed antibodies to the virus, as have deer who are commonly exposed to it.

EHD is similar to Ebola in that it's a viral infection that causes fever and internal bleeding, but wildlife officials emphasize that it poses no threat to humans or other animals in the area.

Because the virus is so unstable and begins to break down as soon as its host dies, officials are still trying to get a tissue sample immediately after death to confirm the disease in the laboratory.

There is no known way to cure or prevent the disease, which typically flourishes from August through October. The 1st hard frost -- on average 14 October in the outlying suburbs -- typically kills the midge that spreads EHD.

"It has to run its course," said Marty Jones, Illinois Department of Natural Resources urban deer project manager. Despite the outbreak, he did not expect EHD to have a significant impact on the deer population statewide. "They're a very resilient animal," Jones said, "and will quickly make up any ground in numbers."

[EHD was reported to be in the Chicago suburbs, presumably Cook County, in 2010. It was reported by the Chicago Tribune, 16 Aug 2010 http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-il-deerdisease,0,59861.story?

White-tailed deer develop signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and fever (affected animals frequent bodies of water to lie in to reduce their body temperature), and finally become unconscious. Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood results in a blue appearance of the oral mucosa, hence the name 'bluetongue.' Then, 8 to 36 hours following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state, become prostrate, and die.

Make no mistake, EHD and bluetongue are not the same disease. Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are very similar, although molecularly they are not the same disease.

There is no known effective treatment or control of EHD. Theoretically, an oral vaccine could be developed for administration through a supplementary winter feeding program, but this is presently improbable as some areas with winter feeding are viewed as one mechanism of spreading tuberculosis. Additionally, vaccine companies have not been forthcoming with a willingness to develop a vaccine that could be used for mass vaccination. With more people adopting alternative livestock, such as various species of cervids, the opportunity for vaccine companies is increasing. It may be that lobbyists with the alternative livestock will need to be active in Congress to secure minor use, minor species (MUMS) dollars to be an incentive for the vaccine companies.
