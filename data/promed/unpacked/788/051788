IMED 2021 is opening a window for late-breaker abstracts between 1-14 Sep 2021. If you have an abstract that contains data unavailable before [14 Jul 2021], you may submit it online for consideration.

Late-breaker abstracts are highly competitive; only abstracts containing new, cutting-edge information (not retrospective studies!) will be considered. Note that high scoring IMED 2021 abstracts will be published as a special supplement to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Register on/before 30 Sep 2021, for the early registration discount! Learn more at https://imed.isid.org/.

We look forward to seeing you online at IMED 2021!
