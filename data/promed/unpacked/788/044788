YELLOW FEVER - LIBERIA
**********************
A ProMED-mail post

A case of yellow fever has been confirmed in a 35-year old male hospitalized
in Lofa County in the northern part of the country on 6 July. A second case
is being investigated.
Epidemiological surveillance and early warning system is being strengthened
with Medical Emergency Relief International (MERLIN), a NGO active in the
area. A mass vaccination campaign is being organized jointly by the Ministry
of Health, WHO, Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), MERLIN and UNICEF. Blood
samples taken on the evening of 7 July and the morning of 8 July were
transported to Monrovia and forwarded for laboratory investigation. The
patient subsequently died. The diagnosis was made on the basis of the
detection of IgM antibody to yellow fever virus. The samples were first
tested at the Institut Pasteur in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire and then referred to
the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arboviruses and other Haemorrhagic Fevers,
Institut Pasteur, Paris on 6 August.
WHO Comment: The large scale immunization campaign conducted in early 1996,
following the outbreak which started in July 1995, reached nearly 80% of the
1.3 million people targeted for immunization. However, it could not then be
extended to Lofa County due to the war. The present immunization campaign is
expected to reach the many refugees that are presently being repatriated from
Guinea. This year's campaign may be difficult as it will be conducted during
the rainy season and the bridges leading into the County have been destroyed.
Liberian refugees in Cote d'Ivoire were immunized in close collaboration with
the governement of Cote d'Ivoire.
(Based on information received from MERLIN, and the WHO Collaborating
Centres at Institut Pasteur, Abidjan and Paris)
