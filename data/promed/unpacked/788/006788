Another horse has died of a mosquito-borne illness in Volusia County
in recent days, bringing the number of horses killed by eastern
equine encephalitis (EEE) in the county to 6 so far this year [2009].

More horses have died of the disease in Volusia than in any other
Florida county.

It's a sign that residents need to be wary of exposure to the
disease, which can also be fatal to humans, health officials said. A
Volusia County Health Department advisory about the illness has been
in effect for 2 months, but no human cases have been reported over
the past year. 65 people were infected in Florida between 2001 and 2007.

Here's how to lessen the risk:

* Avoid being outside between dusk and dawn.
* Wear clothing covering skin.
* Wear mosquito repellants that contain DEET or Picaridin or lemon eucalyptus.
* Rid areas around the home of standing water.

Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain, D.V.M. said 2
additional cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) were confirmed
in Iberville Parish and is urging horse owners to vaccinate their horses.

The 1st EEE case, in Rapides Parish, was reported in mid-June 2009
and resulted in the horse's death.

Strain said the Louisiana Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in
Baton Rouge identified EEE, also known as sleeping sickness, as the
cause of death.

"There is no cure for eastern equine encephalitis, but this is a very
preventable disease. Unfortunately, many times horse owners wait
until it's too late," Strain said. "All horse owners should keep
their equine vaccinations up to date and consult a veterinarian if
their horses are displaying any signs."

Signs include depression, lack of coordination and walking in
circles. An infected horse eventually collapses to the ground.

Equine owners with horses displaying any of these signs should
contact their local veterinarian. Any suspected equine
neuro-encephalitis cases should be reported upon suspicion of disease
signs even if blood is not drawn.

State Veterinarian Henry Moreau said eastern equine encephalitis has
a mortality rate of 90 percent. The disease causes encephalitis, or
swelling of the brain, in both horses and humans. Humans and horses
contract the disease from a mosquito that has bitten an infected bird.

Horses that have not been vaccinated should have 2 vaccine doses
administered about 2 weeks apart. Once the initial vaccination has
been given, an annual booster is sufficient to maintain immunity.

The Department of Agriculture and Forestry is working with local
veterinarians, horse owner groups, health officials and local
mosquito abatement programs to monitor the spread of the disease.

[EEE titers in horses wane faster than the other encephalitic
diseases of horses. In areas along the gulf, it may be wise for horse
owners to vaccinate in the early months of the year and again about 5
or 6 months later, as the mosquito season and warm weather are
prolonged in those southern regions. - Mod.TG]
