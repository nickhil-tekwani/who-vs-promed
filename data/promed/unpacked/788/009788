We have seen in the past week about 20 cases (one expat) with the following [symptoms] in the Kedougou region of Senegal:
fever, lower extremity joint pains, back pains, head ache, fatigue, negative Pf [_Plasmodium falciparum_] malaria tests. All Senegalese but the index case was an expat who also presented with a rash a few days into his illness. The expat was treated empirically for non-falciparum malaria as a precaution (normal/low white cell count and decreased platelets).

Is there any confirmation of chikungunya, dengue, other arboviruses or non-falciparum malaria in this region -- perhaps by the Institut Pasteur, Dakar? Do they have any information?

[The symptoms are sufficiently non-specific that it is not possible to determine what the etiological agent(s) responsible for these cases might be. The possible etiologies questioned by Dr. de Frey are reasonable ones. Zika virus might be added to that list because it has been shown to be present in Senegal. In 2008, 2 American scientists were infected by this virus. Interestingly, one of these infected scientists apparently transmitted the virus to his wife, who had not traveled outside the USA, through sexual intercourse. ProMED would appreciate receiving any additional information about these cases as it becomes available. ProMED thanks Dr. de Frey for sending in this report.
