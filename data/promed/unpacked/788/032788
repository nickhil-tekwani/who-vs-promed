There are a few points in the 22nd February posting on Floppy [Flaccid
Trunk Syndrome (FTS) in elephants that need to be clarified and corrected.
The majority of cases of FTS in Zimbabwe are confined to a small area of
Matusadona National Park (MNP), namely the Fothergill and Spurwing Island
areas in the north western corner of the park. MNP is located on the
southern shore of Lake Kariba and the park is bordered by the Lake to the
north, 2 river systems, one on the east and one on the west but is open to
the south allowing movement of elephants into communal land areas. In light
of the geographical make-up of MNP, FTS has nothing to do with habitat loss
as stated, any loss or, more correctly, modification of habitat in MNP has
historically been attributed to drought and the movements of the Lake
Kariba shoreline. I do not believe the elephant population is anywhere near
carrying capacity as it is elsewhere in Zimbabwe to have any impact on habitat.
The key in MNP in terms of habitat is the foreshore, an area devoid of live
trees with extensive areas of _Panicum ripens_, a grass that greens up as
the waters of Lake Kariba recede. The open foreshore has been created by
the low water levels of Lake Kariba attributed to several drought cycles in
southern Africa since the 1960s when the Lake filled up rapidly soon after
construction. This foreshore with Panicum has allowed the development of
large herds of buffalo and impala with accompanying predators, a major
tourist attraction. With long periods of exposure the foreshore has also
become colonized by a number of plant species, some of which are
non-indigenous, for example, _Boerhavia erecta_.
As indicated in the previous posting a plant toxin might be the likely
cause of FTS but it is incorrect to state that the elephants in the area in
question "are now grazing on stuff they do not like". The Fothergill bulls
in MNP have always spent considerable time on the foreshore, including into
the Lake waters, feeding on a variety of plants. They have done this
because the plants are liked and appear palatable, elephants will not eat
"what they do not like" unless under extreme pressure. This is not the case
in MNP. It is this concentration by elephant bulls on plants having
colonized the foreshore that may well be the key.
From an epidemiologist point of view the evolving scenario in 2000 that
has resulted from the extensive heavy rains in southern Africa, with the
elimination of any foreshore around the Lake, is interesting. If the source
is indeed a plant(s) growing on exposed areas, now inundated, will we now
see a cessation in FTS cases in the Fothergill area? If this is the case
and, indeed, if the Lake recedes once again exposing the foreshore will we
see recolonization with the same plants and a subsequent reoccurrence of
FTS? Plant chemists may narrow the gap but Mother Nature may have the last
say.
