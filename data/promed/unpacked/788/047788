Capsicum, tomato crops hit by diseases
--------------------------------------
An unexpected outbreak of buckeye rot and leaf blight diseases that has hit tomato and capsicum crops following heavy rainfall and warm temperatures is giving sleepless nights to farmers.

Tomatoes are one of the major cash crops grown over 25 000 hectares [about 62 000 acres] in lower and mid-altitude areas, with an annual production at one million tonnes. So far, the prevalence of these diseases has caused damage to over 30 to 40 per cent of tomato and capsicum crops in various areas of Solan, Sirmaur, Bilaspur, Una, Kangra, Hamirpur, and Mandi districts.

Vijay Singh Thakur, University of Horticulture and Forestry, said, "Scientists visited some of the worst-affected areas and advised farmers to follow the recommended spray schedule and prescribed measures to prevent these diseases from spreading further." He added that rainfall, especially in June [2015], led to increase in humidity and waterlogging in fields, helping fungal diseases to spread. "Losses are expected to rise further if it continues to rain," he said.

"Officials of the agriculture department should immediately visit the affected areas and educate farmers on checking the spread of [the] diseases to prevent heavy losses," said a former chairman of the Solan market committee. Buckeye rot mainly occurs when temperature falls at night after it has rained during the day.

[Buckeye rot
-----------
Phytophthora blight of tomato is also referred to as buckeye rot because of the characteristic lesions on the fruit. It is mainly caused by the fungus-like pathogen _Phytophthora nicotianae_ (previously _P. parasitica_), but other _Phytophthora_ species such as _P. capsici_ may also be involved. The pathogens can affect a range of other crops as well, including solanaceous and cucurbit vegetables.

Symptoms on tomato include brown spots on green and ripe fruit, often at the blossom end and often appearing as concentric rings ('buckeyes'). Lesions may appear where the fruit has contact with wet soil. Internal fruit tissue rots and young fruits may become mummified. In high humidity, white fungal growth may appear and fruit are likely to rot quickly from secondary organisms. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures and wet conditions.

The pathogens are soil borne and are also spread by water (rain, irrigation) and with infected plant material. Disease management may include phytosanitary measures to reduce inoculum, cultural measures to reduce soil moisture and to prevent tomato fruits from contact with the soil, crop rotation and fungicides. No tomato cultivars with resistance to buckeye rot are available.

Bacterial blight
----------------
Bacterial (leaf) blight (also called leaf spot) of tomato is caused by _Xanthomonas vesicatoria_ (previously _X. campestris_ pv. _vesicatoria_). There are a number of strains in the species and some can also affect capsicum. Solanaceous weeds may act as pathogen reservoirs. The disease is considered the most destructive leaf disease of tomato and capsicum. Symptoms include necrotic leaf spots, premature leaf drop and spots on fruit, which make it unmarketable. Disease progress and pathogen spread to neighbouring crops can be very rapid in warm, humid weather.

The bacteria are spread by mechanical means (including non-specific insect activity), splashing rain, and infected plant and other materials. They survive between crops mainly on seed, but also in infected plant debris (such as stalks) and may be able to survive in the soil to some extent, possibly in the rhizosphere of non-host plants. Under favourable conditions, one infected seed in 10 000 may lead to 100 percent infection of a field. Disease management is difficult and includes use of clean planting material, crop rotation and preventative bactericidal sprays. Resistant tomato and capsicum cultivars are available. Some related _Xanthomonas_ species can infect other vegetable and fruit crops.

An outbreak of the 2 diseases was also reported from the same area in 2010 (see ProMED-mail post 20101001.3560).
