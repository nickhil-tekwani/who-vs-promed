The 2 patients diagnosed with yellow fever in Oro-Ago in Ifelodun Local government area of Kwara state are now medically stable.

Dr Khadeejah Kamaldeen of the Kwara State Epidemiology Unit made the confirmation in an interview with newsmen in Ilorin. Kamaldeen said that the patients are responding to treatment and are expected to make full recovery.

The Epidemiologist said earlier confirmation of the yellow fever cases were diagnosed in Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). She said that samples were additionally sent to Dakar, Senegal for further confirmation that proved positive.

Kamaldeen explained that yellow fever is a vaccine preventable disease and urged residents to go for vaccination against it. She appealed to mothers across the state to pay special attention to vaccination of their children.

According to her, the state government needed more support from partners in terms of vaccination logistics for yellow fever to allow for wider coverage of the state.

Kamaldeen said the symptoms for yellow fever are fever, headache, vomiting and fatigue, while in extreme cases there are emission of blood from victim's mouth and nose like Lassa fever.

She added that yellow fever is not contagious but advised anyone with such symptoms to report to the state Ministry of Health. The epidemiologist also advised people to use long lasting insecticidal nets and mosquito repellents to prevent yellow Fever.

[The yellow fever (YF) diagnosed is now laboratory confirmed. Fortunately, the 2 patients are stable and reported to be on the road to recovery, and no additional reports of YF have been reported in the areas where the 2 patients acquired their YF virus infections. There is no further information about the test results of the 38 blood samples collected from individuals in some nearby communities. The previous report indicated that mosquitoes are common in the area, but the critical question that remains is whether _Aedes aegypti_ are present and these cases were infected in the urban cycle of transmission or from spill-over from the sylvan cycle transmitted by forest mosquitoes or those of rural areas.
