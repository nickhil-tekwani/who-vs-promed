North Korea is apparently suffering from its own bout of
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], according to a South Korean military official.

"According to South Korean and U.S. intelligence, roads have been
blocked by the military near Pyongyang to decrease movement of
people," said the official, who asked not to be named. The source
said that quarantine measures are proving difficult for North Korea,
which lacks preventive medicine such as vaccines and quicklime in
which to bury contagious animals.

Although the extremely contagious disease has only been detected in
areas near North Korea's capital of Pyongyang, the communist military
is known to raise livestock in large numbers to feed its soldiers.
The source said that North Koreans have been consuming infected pigs
and cattle instead of culling them.

FMD is known to be harmless to humans. South Korea has been battling
the disease for weeks.

This is the 2nd time that North Korea has experienced an outbreak of
the disease. The 1st outbreak was reported in 2007.

At that time, officials from other countries and from the World
Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] visited the country on a
consultative mission and said there was a "limited danger" for severe
outbreaks in the country. Roughly 4000 animals were culled during
that outbreak. It is not yet known whether the same aid will be given
this year [2011] from international organizations.

North and South Korea cooperated in 2007 against the outbreak, but
frigid current relations may preclude cooperation this time round.

[This piece of information -- in spite of being far from surprising
-- is in need of official confirmation. The North Korean authorities,
as all OIE member countries, are expected to notify immediately any
suspected case of FMD.

The 2007 outbreak in DPR Korea ("North Korea") was retroactively
found by WRL, Pirbright, UK to have been caused by FMDV serotype
Asia1 and not by serotype O, as initially suspected and reported; see
