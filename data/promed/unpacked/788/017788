TRYPANOSOMIASIS, TIGERS - PAKISTAN (04)

In the ProMED posting on Trypanosomiasis, tigers - Pakistan
[reference below] it is said that suspected human cases of
trypanosomiasis were reported from India in 2005 but never confirmed,
and ProMED does not consider human cases to have been confirmed in
Southeast Asia. However, in the paper by Joshi et al., Human
trypanosomiasis caused by Trypanosoma evansi: the first case report.
Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg., 73(3), 2005, pp. 491-495, a human case is
described in detail (with color photographs of the parasite). An
editorial in the same paper: Brun R, Am J Trop Med Hyg 2005,73(3);484
discusses the report.

[We thank Frans van Gompel for informing us about the case report.
The presence of the parasite is documented by both serological
methods and PCR (detection of trypanosome specific DNA by polymerase
chain reaction). As pointed out in the editorial in the same issue,
it is surprising that the parasite could not be isolated in mice. We
presume that the case report now published describes the case
discussed in ProMED in 2004 (Trypanosomiasis - India (03)
20041216.3323; see below). We would be happy to publish further
information such as serological surveys from humans in the area the
patient came from. - Mod.EP]
