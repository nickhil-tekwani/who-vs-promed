16 patients have hepatitis in Army needle scare
-----------------------------------------------
Army officials say 16 patients exposed to a mismanaged insulin needle
program at a military hospital in Texas have tested positive for
hepatitis B or C [virus infection]. The patients at the William
Beaumont Army Medical Center were among more than 2000 diabetics who
may have been exposed to blood-borne illnesses because multiple
patients were given injections from the same insulin pen. Officials
at the Army hospital at Fort Bliss have said it's unclear if the
patients contracted hepatitis from the injections that were performed
from August 2007 to January 2009.
