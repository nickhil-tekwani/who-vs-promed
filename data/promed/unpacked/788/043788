Influenza Update No. 238

Summary
--------
Globally, influenza activity has decreased from its peak in early 2015 to low levels.

- In North America, influenza activity continued to decrease and was nearing inter-seasonal levels. Influenza type B has increased in recent weeks resulting in a slowed decline in overall influenza activity.

- In Europe, influenza activity continued to decline with all countries reporting low levels. Although influenza A(H3N2) virus dominated for the season, influenza B continued to dominate in recent weeks.

- In northern Africa, influenza activity has continued to decrease and remained low in general, with influenza A viruses predominant.

- In western Asia, overall influenza activity, mainly associated with influenza A viruses, continued to decrease or remained low.

- In the temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease and remained low in most countries.

- In tropical countries of the Americas and Asia, influenza activity continued to decrease and remained low in most countries. However, influenza activity increased in Sri Lanka.

- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.

- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 28 May 2015 12:00 UTC), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 83 countries, areas or territories reported data for the period from 3 to 16 May 2015.

The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 39 635 specimens. 2980 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1044 (35 percent) were typed as influenza A and 1936 (65 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 359 (46.6 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 412 (53.4 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 155 (95.1 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 8 (4.9 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
-----------------------------------
North America
Influenza activity decreased overall, but an increase in influenza B in recent weeks has resulted in a slowed decline in activity.

In Canada, overall influenza continued to decline with elevated activity still being reported in parts of Central Canada and Newfoundland. Influenza type B was the predominant virus detected.

In the United States of America, influenza activity continued to decrease with some late season circulation of influenza type B. Pneumonia and influenza mortality remained below the epidemic threshold.

In Mexico, both influenza A and influenza B detections (3 percent total) continued to decrease. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) activity remained at a low level and is decreasing (328 ARI cases by 100 000 habitants). Pneumonia activity continued to decrease but remained at elevated levels (2 pneumonia cases per 100 000 habitants).

Europe
----
Overall influenza activity continued to decrease with all countries reporting a low intensity of influenza activity. The proportion of influenza positive samples decreased to below the threshold of 10 percent, returning to baseline levels. While influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) continued to circulate, influenza type B viruses predominated.

In Eastern Europe, overall influenza activity decreased and remained low in most countries.

Northern Africa and Middle East
-----------------------
Influenza activity has continued decreasing in most countries throughout the region. Influenza A activity was predominant throughout most countries.

Western Asia
------------
Influenza activity continued to decrease in most countries, and influenza A was the predominant virus type throughout the region. Bahrain showed some residual influenza activity, but it has decreased from its peak.

Central Asia
--------
Some countries reported low influenza activity with influenza B virus predominating in recent weeks.

Eastern Asia
----
Influenza activity decreased to very low levels throughout the region. Most countries have ended their seasons with slight influenza B activity. North China reported a continued decrease in influenza activity with only a few influenza positive samples identified, mainly influenza B virus. Japan and the Republic of Korea also reported sporadic influenza B activity.

Countries in the tropical zone
--------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean

Overall influenza activity in the Caribbean, Central America and the tropical countries of South America continued to experience little to no influenza activity. A few countries reported slight influenza activity, including Guatemala which reported a small increase in influenza A(H3N2) activity in the beginning of May [2015].

Central African tropical region
-------
In Africa, low levels of influenza activity were reported except in West Africa. Cote d'Ivoire reported increase in influenza activity with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses co-circulating in recent weeks. Ghana reported a decrease in influenza activity but levels remained elevated with influenza A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominating.

Tropical Asia
---
Influenza activity and ILI [Influenza-like illness] cases continued to decrease with the exception of Sri Lanka, which reported an increase in influenza A activity. South China reported decreased influenza activity mainly due to influenza B viruses. Hong Kong SAR also reported sporadic activity, with a predominance of influenza A viruses throughout the season and low influenza B virus detections at the end of the season.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
--------------------------
In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels in most of the reporting countries. In South Africa, influenza activity increased with reports of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus predominating. In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity remained below the seasonal threshold with reports of A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and type B virus cocirculating.

Source of data
-------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[Little change has been observed in the global situation, and no markedly distinctive strains of seasonal influenza have appeared. With the decline in the past few weeks of seasonal influenza, the avian influenza viruses currently pose a greater problem for human health.
