In a follow-up to an earlier story, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, or Folkehelseinstituttet, announced additional cases of botulism among intravenous drug users in the Oslo area. Health officials were notified of 2 additional cases of clinically probable botulism in people who had injected heroin outside the veins. This follows the 1st case, which was reported at Christmas time [2014]. It is important to increase awareness that possible contaminated heroin may be in circulation.

This brings the total to 3 cases since late December 2014. In all cases, the heroin was obtained in the drug environment in Oslo, health officials note. Most people with injection drug-associated botulism are users of so-called "black tar heroin," a specific preparation of heroin. Risk is also higher for those who inject the drug directly into tissues (skin popping), as opposed to into veins.

Black tar heroin is a thick, gummy substance, and because of this, it needs to be diluted. Many experts believe the source of the botulism is in the "cutting agent," which is believed to be things like dirt and honey.

[Wound botulism occurs when spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ contaminate a wound, germinate, and produce botulinum neurotoxin in vivo. Most of the wound botulism cases have been among injecting drug users (IDUs). Those IDUs who intentionally or accidentally inject subcutaneously or intramuscularly may be particularly vulnerable to infection.

Black tar heroin continues to be associated with clusters of wound botulism, both in the USA and in Europe. This form of heroin is a gummy, black substance usually produced in makeshift factories, mostly in Mexico, adjacent to opium poppy fields (1). It is generally injected subcutaneously in a process referred to as skin popping. The local area may be unremarkable or may be necrotic or abscess forming.

The tarry nature of the drug has led to a number of diluents ("cutting" agents), which have been postulated to be the source of the _C. botulinum_ spores. In Passaro's study (1), the development of wound botulism was not affected by cleaning the skin, cleaning the injection paraphernalia, or sharing needles.

Clinicians should suspect botulism in any patient with a descending, flaccid paralysis. Botulinum antitoxin is effective in reducing the severity of symptoms for all forms of botulism if administered early in the course of the disease and should not be delayed for the results of microbiological testing.

In cases of wound botulism, antimicrobial therapy and surgical debridement are necessary to remove the organism and avoid relapse after antitoxin treatment. _C. botulinum_ is sensitive to benzyl penicillin and metronidazole.

Toxin type A (one of now 8 types of botulinum toxin) causes most cases of wound botulism in the USA. The syndrome produced by toxin type A is most severe, with more rapid progression of paralysis and a higher proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. All toxin types exert their action on the cholinergic system at the presynaptic motor-neuron terminal by blocking acetylcholine transmission across the neuromuscular junction.
