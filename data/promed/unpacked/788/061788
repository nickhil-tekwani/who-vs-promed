The very dangerous disease in pigs, African swine fever, has been confirmed in Lithuania, as BNS has been informed by the Veterinary Service. According to the office spokeswoman Jurgita Savickaite, the plague was detected in an analyzed boar.

The chief veterinary officer, Jonas Milius, told RTL radio that the contamination was found in the Salcininku and Varenos areas. According to him, 2 boars were found infected on the border of Alytus [county]. He expressed his view that penetration of the virus could be prevented due to the tightening of bio-security measures for several months already. He remarked that the movement of wild boars, throughout Europe, is difficult to control.

According to information received last night [24 Jan 2014] by Rosselkhoznadzor from the Director, State Food and Veterinary Service of Lithuania, Jonas Milius, the study of pathological material from 2 boars from Alytus-Varna Shalchininskogo regions of Lithuania, the National Institute for Risk Assessment Food and Veterinary identified African swine fever [ASF] virus. In the districts at risk -- Alytus, Lazdijai, Druskininkai, Warren and Salcininkai -- anti-epizootic measures have been applied.

In addition, throughout Lithuania, increased control of pig holdings has been put into operation and active surveillance addressing ASF applied.

[The news release further provides details of measures undertaken in Belarus to prevent any possible ASF contamination of pig-derived food products, as well as measures related to live pigs and their semen. For details, please refer to the full text at the source URL. - Mod AS]

In the absence of borders between EU countries and the freedom of movement of goods subject to veterinary inspection, which carry risks of proliferation of ASF, negotiations between the veterinary services of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Rosselkhoznadzor, as well as consultation with veterinary services of the European Union on the feasibility of introducing temporary restrictions on the supply of such products in the territory of the Customs Union with the whole territory of the European Union, are expected soon.

In accordance with the legislation of the Customs Union on biological protection of its territory, Rosselhoznadzor joins the restrictive measures proposed by the veterinary service of Belarus.

[An official notification to the OIE on the 1st occurrence of ASF in Lithuania is expected early next week (week of 26 Jan 2014). Further spread of ASF, mainly by means of wild boars, into other parts of Europe is a matter of grave concern.

Subscribers are referred to FAO's 2012 document "African Swine Fever (ASF) recent developments -- timely updates" at http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/ap372e/ap372e.pdf.

A map, showing the (very) high density of wild boars in Europe, is available in figure 4b (page 5) of the said useful review. - Mod.AS
