Mad Cow Disease May Be a Global Threat, UN Food Agency Warns
--------------------------------------------
ROME: The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), warned Friday
that mad cow disease could spread worldwide, and urged governments to take
steps to prevent the epidemic reaching humans.
The FAO said that all countries that have imported cattle or meat and bone
meal (MBM) from western Europe -- especially Britain -- since the 1980s
could be considered at risk from the disease. [The UN agency stated "there
is an increasingly grave situation developing in the European Union, with
BSE being identified in cattle in several member-states of the EU which
have, until recently, been regarded as free from the disease."
The UN food agency called for more research to be conducted into the nature
of the infectious agent and its modes of transmission, as much remains
unknown about the disease. There is currently no method of diagnosis at
early stages of infection and no cure for the disease, either in animals or
humans.
While expressing support for EU decisions to fight the epidemic, the
organisation said "there is an urgent need to refine the risk assessment and
to extend it to other countries and regions. Countries at risk should
implement effective surveillance for BSE in cattle and controls on the
animal feed and meat industries. At present, this means laboratory testing
of samples from slaughtered cattle, and correct disposal of fallen stock and
improved processing of offal and by-products." The FAO also suggested that
countries outside the 15-nation European Union adopt appropriate measures to
protect their herds and to ensure the safety of meat and meat products.
The FAO advised countries which have imported animals as well MBM from
BSE-infected trading partners to consider a precautionary ban on the feeding
of MBM to ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats) or, to reduce the risk of
infection even further, to all animals.
Germany, where 19 cases of BSE have so far been found, meanwhile lowered the
age for testing slaughtered cattle for mad cow disease from 30 to 24 months
despite a statement by the European Commission earlier this month that
screening had only proven fully reliable in tests on cattle aged 30 months
or more. The EU's executive body said that the infectious agent could only
be detected after an estimated 3 to 5 year period of incubation.
