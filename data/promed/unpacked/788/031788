From: owner-mmwr-toc@list.cdc.gov
Subject: June 7, 1996 CDC Recommendations and Reports
The June 7, 1996 edition of CDC Recommendations
and Reports is now available in Adobe Acrobat format on the Internet.
June 7, 1996/Vol. 45/No. RR-8
* Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis in Correctional Facilities
Recommendations of the Advisory Council for the Elimination of
Tuberculosis
To access the MMWR via the MMWR web page:
http://www.cdc.gov/
Go to: "Publications, Products, and Subscription Services," then
"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)" to find the MMWR.
-OR-
Via anonymous FTP:
ftp.cdc.gov in directory pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4508.pdf
If you do not have access to either FTP or the WWW, you may retrieve the
MMWR via e-mail from the FTP mail server. This process is much slower and
more complex than either anonymous FTP or the World Wide Web.
Copy the following script, and paste it into an e-mail message addressed
to lists@list.cdc.gov
get mmwr mmwr.archive.960607
FTP mail will send the file uuencoded. Depending on your e-mail system,
some sites may have to process the received mail with a uudecode utility
to create an acceptable binary file readable by Acrobat. If the e-mail
system does not have uudecode, contact your e-mail administrator.
Uudecode software is available free of charge at many FTP sites on the
Internet.
If you need further instructions about FTP mail send an e-mail message to
ftpmail@crawford.com. The subject line should remain blank, and the body of
the message should read:
help
The FTP mail server will send you a detailed help file with further
instructions and commands.
If you have other problems or questions, send e-mail to
mmwr-questions@list.cdc.gov
