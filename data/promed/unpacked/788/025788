There are 700 000 cases of the disease trachoma in the Sudan. Federal Health Minister Dr. Tabita Boutros says that they are facing obstacles in efforts to eliminate the disease, especially in Darfur, with the deteriorating security situation, poor distribution of human resources, and lack of infrastructure, food, and drinking water in rural areas.

The minister said that 21 million Sudanese people are exposed to the disease.

[Trachoma is a chronic keratoconjunctivitis caused by recurrent infections with ocular serotypes of _Chlamydia trachomatis_, an obligate intracellular bacterium. Infection often begins during infancy or childhood, and, if left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards (trichiasis), which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the cornea, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the cornea. This ultimately leads to blindness by the time the person is an adult.

Trachoma is endemic in regions characterized by poverty, crowding, poor personal and family hygiene, lack of safe water, absence of latrines or toilets, flies, and lack of facial cleanliness. Trachoma is spread person-to-person among children and within families by frequent exchange of infected ocular discharge from one child's face to another, by direct contact with secretions of affected individuals, by contact with contaminated inanimate objects, such as towels and/or washcloths, and by flies.

The following is extracted from the WHO document "Global Health Observatory - Trachoma," available at http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/trachoma/en/:

Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most remote rural areas in 57 countries of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, Australia, and the Middle East. Roughly half of the global burden of active trachoma is concentrated in 5 countries (Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Uganda and Sudan), and that of trichiasis in 4 countries (China, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Uganda). Overall, Africa is the most affected continent: 27.8 million cases of active trachoma (68.5 percent of all cases globally) and 3.8 million cases of trichiasis (46.6 percent of all cases globally) occur in 28/46 countries in the African region.

The highest prevalence of active trachoma has been reported from Ethiopia and Sudan, where the infection often occurs in more than 50 percent of children younger than 10 years; trichiasis is found in up to 19 percent of adults. Implementation of the SAFE strategy will lead to the elimination of blinding trachoma by 2020. In 2008, about 60 percent of the population in need received preventive chemotherapy using antibiotics, and about 45 percent received surgical care. Ghana, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Morocco, and Oman have reported reaching their elimination targets.

The SAFE Strategy is an innovative public health approach designed to treat and prevent trachoma (http://trachoma.org/safe-strategy). The components of SAFE are: Surgery to correct inturned eyelids; Antibiotics (e.g. azithromycin) to prevent and treat active infection; Facial cleanliness to prevent disease transmission; and Environmental change to improve access to water and proper disposal of human and animal waste (http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/diseases/trachoma/en/).

Antibiotics that are used to treat active infection are one percent tetracycline eye ointment administered to both eyes twice daily for 6 weeks or azithromycin administered as one oral dose (20 mg/kg body weight). Tetracycline eye ointment is cheap and is almost universally available, but compliance is often poor, whereas azithromycin is well tolerated but is relatively expensive, unless donated by Pfizer Inc. through the International Trachoma Initiative (Mariotti SP. New steps toward eliminating blinding trachoma. N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 2004-7).

WHO Guidelines recommend that a district should receive community-based, mass-antibiotic treatment when the prevalence of active trachoma among one to 9-year-old children is greater than 10 percent, and treatment should be repeated annually for 3 years, after which, a repeat district survey is carried out. If the district prevalence in one to 9-year-old children is still 10 percent or greater, annual mass treatment should be continued. If the prevalence is less than 10 percent, surveys should be conducted to determine the prevalence at the community level. Then, in communities in which the prevalence is less than 5 percent, treatment can be stopped, and in communities in which the prevalence is 5 percent or greater, annual treatment should continue until it falls below 5 percent http://www.who.int/blindness/publications/tcm%20who_pbd_get_06_1.pdf.
