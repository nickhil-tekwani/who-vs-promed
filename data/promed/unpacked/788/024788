New outbreaks
-------------
Outbreak 1 (PPR GOREN) GOREN, Acco, HAZAFON [Interactive map included
at the source URL]
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Sep 2011
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 1130 / 220 / 80 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 30 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: The flock is a Saanen milking goat flock which
contains 680 adult milking goats (vaccinated in April 2011), 220 young
females (2-4 months), 160 very young females (0-2 months) and 70 very
young males (0-2 months). All these last 3 groups had not been
vaccinated before the outbreak. The outbreak began in the milking goat
group, where 5 females were found dead in 3 days. No other clinical
signs were observed in this group. At postmortem, 3 ulcers were found
on the mouth of one of the goats. Pneumonia was also observed in the
necropsy. A few days later, the group of young goats (2-4 months)
began to show clinical signs as anorexia, apathy, weakness, mild
diarrhea, and death. The animals had no fever. In this group of 220,
about 140 showed one or more clinical signs, and 66 of them died in 2
waves. The postmortem revealed diarrhea, bilateral consolidation of
the lungs, necrosis of the end of the cecum, and ulcers on the gums.

Summary of outbreaks
--------------------
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak statistics [rates are percentages]
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent
case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 19.47 / 7.08 / 36.36 / 7.08
Sheep / 0.00 / 0.00 / 0.00 / ** 0.00

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction
and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
------------
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new
live animals

Epidemiological comments: A few days before the outbreak, 5 sheep were
bought by the owner from an animal dealer who bought sheep from the
flock of the previous outbreak (Umm Al-Fahm) in September 2011. The
epidemiological investigation is continuing to try to find other sick
animals which have been marketed by the dealer. The sequence
identified in the laboratory is different from the sequence of the
vaccine. Immunohistochemical test is pending.

Control measures
----------------
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country;
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s):
Administrative division / Species (total vaccinated)
HAZAFON / Sheep (30), Goats (1050)

[PPR has been absent in Israel since February 2006, in tandem with the
introduction of the live-attenuated homologous PPR vaccine within a
general annual preventive vaccination scheme in sheep and goats
throughout the country. After the absence of disease for more than 5
years, on 7 Sep 2011, Israel reported to the OIE an outbreak which had
started on 28 Aug 2011 [see 20110908.2742].

In contrast to the above case in Umm Al-Fahm, in the current case,
which started 3 weeks later, stamping-out has not been applied;
instead, vaccination of young animals and revaccination of the entire
flock, in addition to quarantine measures, were preferred. This
decision deserves clarification. Was this decided because, in contrast
to the 1st outbreak, the source of the current infection was
identified and the efficacy of the general vaccination, routinely
applied throughout the country, demonstrated and relied upon? Has the
size of the flock played also a role in the decision? (the 1st
outbreak involved 54 animals).

In the meantime, we are informed that about 2 weeks after the
vaccination, a large proportion of the goats in the flock have
developed severe keratoconjuctivitis, including several cases of
blindness. Tests, carried out by the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI)
at Beit-Dagan, have revealed _Mycoplasma conjuctivae_, the causative
agent of infectious keratoconjuctivitis in caprines. It is not clear
whether this event is related to the PPR outbreak or to the
vaccination. Experienced subscribers are invited to share their
gathered relevant information. - Mod.AS]
