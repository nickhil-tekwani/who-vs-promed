A 48 year-old male from Morang district (Eastern Nepal) was admitted to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH) with a history of yellow discoloration of the skin, itching throughout the whole body, lethargy and high-grade fever (intermittent). He had a travel history to New Delhi (India) in February 2015, where he spent approximately 2 months. The symptoms appeared one month after his arrival in New Delhi. At 1st, he visited a skin specialist (in New Delhi) in order to identify and treat the skin disease. However, the symptoms did not resolve, but instead yellowing of the skin became prominent. He then underwent laboratory screening for HAV [hepatitis A virus], HBV [hepatitis B virus] and HEV [hepatitis E virus]. He was tested positive for anti-HEV IgM [immunoglobulin M]. He then returned to Nepal and was admitted to the local general hospital in Morang district and received treatment, and from there he was referred to this hospital [STIDH] for further and proper treatment. He is currently being treated at STIDH.

The patient may have been exposed to HEV in New Delhi, indicating that currently HEV outbreak may be occurring in New Delhi, India. There is a potential risk of introducing HEV in Kathmandu due to a huge population movement by air and land between New Delhi and Kathmandu.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Pun for the 1st hand report.

Hepatitis E virus (HEV), which is transmitted via the fecal-oral route, is the commonest cause of acute viral hepatitis globally. Large HEV outbreaks have been documented in crowded settings that have poor water, sanitation, and hygiene conditions. Pregnant women suffer disproportionately high mortality from hepatitis E.

A recombinant, 3-dose series HEV vaccine has been produced but has not yet been pre-qualified by WHO. The vaccine has been shown to prevent symptomatic HEV infection and proven to be safe and effective in people aged 16-64 years. Limited vaccine safety data in 37 pregnant women receiving 57 doses have been reported; however, further research is needed, and safety for children is unknown. The vaccine is expected to be protective against HEV genotype 1, the strain associated with most waterborne outbreaks in Africa and Asia. - Mod.LL
