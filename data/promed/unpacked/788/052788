Pueblo County [Colorado] rabbit tests positive for tularemia
------------------------------------------------------------
Rabbit fever has again been confirmed in Pueblo County.

A rabbit that was collected from the Hatchet Ranch area in the southwestern part of the county has tested positive for tularemia.

"Pueblo residents are advised that tularemia-causing bacteria may be present in some of the mammals -- especially rabbits, rodents and hares, and on the ground where these animals may be active," said Vicki Carlton, program manager in the Environmental Health and Emergency Preparedness division at the Pueblo City-County Health Department. "Although there are no human cases of tularemia identified in Pueblo so far this year [2016], Colorado has experienced human tularemia cases in people who have been exposed to contaminated soil, drinking contaminated water or inhaling bacteria," she said.

Typical signs of infection in humans include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, chest pain, and coughing. Tularemia can be effectively treated with antibiotics; therefore should you have any of these early signs, contact your medical provider.

Dogs and cats also get tularemia by eating infected rabbits or other rodents and through tick and deer fly bites. If your pet shows symptoms of illness including fever, nasal and eye discharge, and skin sores, take it to a veterinarian promptly. Tularemia is easily treated if diagnosed early in dogs and cats.

Recommended precautions include:

- Avoid handling wild animals.

- When outdoors near places where wild rabbits or rodents are present, wear insect repellent containing DEET.

- Use a dust mask when mowing or doing yard work. Do not mow over animal carcasses.

- Leash your pets when outdoors and keep them away from dead animals.

- Routinely use a tick and flea prevention treatment on pets.

- If a dead animal must be moved, avoid direct contact with it. Wear insect repellent to protect yourself from its fleas or ticks, and use a long-handled shovel to scoop it up. Place it in a garbage bag and dispose in an outdoor trash receptacle. Wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.

- Wear proper footwear outdoors where dead animals have been found.

- Do not go barefoot or wear sandals while gardening, mowing or landscaping.

- Wear gloves while gardening or landscaping, and wash your hands after these activities.

- Do not drink unpurified water from streams or lakes or allow your pets to drink surface waters.

- If you hunt, trap or skin animals, take additional steps: Use impervious gloves when skinning or handling animals, especially rabbits. Cook the meat of wild rabbits thoroughly to a temperature of 165 degrees F or higher.

[The following information is quoted from "Tularemia Surveillance" (last modified on 24 Jul 2015) on the APHIS-USDA National Wildlife Disease Program (NWDP) website, available at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/programs/SA_NWDP/CT_Tularemia.

"Tularemia has been identified as a disease of concern to human, wildlife and domestic animal populations within the United States. It, like plague, is considered a 'Category A' disease by the Department of Homeland Security, meaning it could potentially be used as a bioterrorist agent.

Location
Tularemia is found most often in the South-Central and Western US, mostly in rural areas. It is also found internationally, throughout the Northern Hemisphere in places like Japan, Russia and Scandinavia.

Disease Agent
Tularemia is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_.

Affected Species
Tularemia mostly affects, and is reservoired within, a variety of mammals including (but not limited to) beavers, water voles, rabbits, hares, skunks and coyotes.

The disease is not contagious from human to human, but can be spread by the bites of fleas, ticks and other arthropods that have fed on infected wildlife, or by contact with the carcass of the infected animal. Reported human cases of tularemia in the United States currently average about 200 yearly, a dramatic reduction from the over 1000 cases per year that occurred in the 1930s and 1940s.

NWDP Activities
NWDP biologists and their collaborators are currently sampling aquatic rodents and other susceptible species across the US to detect the presence of tularemia antibodies in their blood. Due to the focus on early detection, local health professionals can be alerted when tularemia is present in a region and take this into consideration when examining certain symptoms.

In humans, tularemia 1st emerges as a flu-like illness. Depending on the method of exposure to the bacterium, infected individuals may also experience lesions, swollen lymph glands and even the development of pneumonia. When these symptoms are positively identified as tularemia, they can be treated with prescription antibiotics." - Mod.CRD
