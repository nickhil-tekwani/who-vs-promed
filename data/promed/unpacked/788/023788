----------------------------------------------------------------------
In March 2017, canker symptoms were observed in the branches and stems of several apple trees (_Malus pumila_) in Santa Catarina State, Brazil. Intense bacterial exudation from wounds caused by pruning, and colonisation and discoloration of the pith and conducting vessels, especially the xylem, was observed. The leaves of affected trees wilted and ultimately trees died. This raised concerns because of the government's contingency plan to respond to the introduction of fire blight.

A bacterium was isolated from affected plants. Biochemical and physiological tests indicated that the isolates belonged to Enterobacteriaceae. Metabolic profiling of bacterial suspension indicated that the isolate had a high similarity to _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp. _brasiliensis_. However, PCR specific for _Pectobacterium_ was negative, whereas PCR specific for _Dickeya_ was positive. Sequencing of the PCR product (420 bp) generated 329 bp which had 99% identity with _Dickeya dadantii_. PCR to amplify the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA resulted in 1417 bp [which] showed 99% identity with _D. dadantii_ (synonymous _Erwinia chrysanthemi_). Our isolate clustered with _D. dadantii_ in a phylogenetic tree. Real-time PCR specific for _D. dadantii_ confirmed the result.

Terminal branches of apple cvs. Royal Gala and Fuji Suprema were dipped in bacterial suspension. 5 days after inoculation, both cultivars showed leaf necrosis followed by wilt and death, the vascular system of inoculated branches darkened. No symptoms were observed in control plants. The pathogen was re-isolated from symptomatic branches, fulfilling Koch's postulates.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of _D. dadantii_ causing disease in apple trees in the world. Our proposal is that the disease should be called "Dickeya canker".

[Several species and subspecies of bacteria in the genera _Dickeya_ and _Pectobacterium_ , including the ones mentioned above, are known to cause blackleg and bacterial soft rot of potato, both serious diseases of the crop. The pathogens can also affect other crops, causing for example, a foot rot disease in rice as well as stem and root rot of sweet potato.

The bacteria can survive in soil and are spread with contaminated plant or other material (including farming or cutting tools), by mechanical means and with water. Disease management may include cultural techniques, use of clean planting material and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the pathogens from external sources. Certification schemes for planting material are a vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

Population shifts of the potato pathogens are being observed in many areas. Both in Europe and North America, species recorded earlier as causes of blackleg are being replaced by more virulent species. Possible reasons for these population shifts are thought to be climate changes and selection pressure due to intensified agriculture. A shift of host range to include apple, as described above, may be part of the same process.

Fire blight of pome fruit, the other disease mentioned above, is caused by _Erwinia amylovora_ (for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).

_Malus pumila_ is the apple species commonly grown for commercial fruit production, with many varieties being cultivated.
