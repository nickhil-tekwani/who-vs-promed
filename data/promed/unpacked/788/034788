Turkey battles the virus that spreads from tick bites, which has
started to take lives. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a
risk in 15 provinces and 1200 villages in Turkey.

The Turkish Ministry of Health Basic Health Services Deputy General
Manager Mehmet Ali Torunoglu said: "Tick-borne disease is a risk in 15
provinces, and 95 percent of all cases are seen in those 1200
villages." Stating that there is no risk in cities, Torunoglu said
ticks in the cities do not cause CCHF.

Torunoglu said that due to panic caused by CCHF, 283 000 people were
admitted to health institutions last year [2008] but only 1315
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases were confirmed, and 63 people
lost their lives.

Ministry of Health officials have reached 150 000 houses in the 15
provinces that are at high risk since February this year [2009], and
approximately 600 000 people were trained face to face about the
tick-borne disease. Brochures and free solution containing permethrin
were distributed. Torunoglu also explained that "protective clothing
[is] to be distributed in risk areas and a 20-minute training film
[has been] prepared for field visits."

The provinces under high risk are on the Middle Black Sea and the
north of Central Anatolia, especially Tokat, Corum, Yozgat, Sivas,
Samsun, Kastamonu and Karabuk.

Stating that sprays are being distributed in rural areas, Torunoglu
explained how to use the sprays: "This spray should be delivered on
your clothes often, and wait 2 hours to dry. Then the tick dies if it
reaches to the top of this clothing for 3 to 4 weeks" [i.e. this
treatment remains effective for 3 to 4 weeks?].

Torunoglu urged people to wear special sprayed clothes during their
work and not to neglect daily tick checks. Reminding the public that
an effective vaccine for protection from CCHF has yet to be found,
Torunoglu said personal protection measures are important.

Measures to be taken to prevent tick-borne disease:

- When visiting rural areas, wear light colored clothing, and legs of
pants should be tucked into the socks.

- Exposed parts of the body should be protected by repellents.

- Clothes should be sprayed with permethrin containing drugs that are
effective against ticks for a long time.

- People who work in agriculture and animal husbandry especially
should do daily tick checks for themselves and their families.

- When a tick is identified on the body, as soon as possible, the tick
should be removed by an appropriate method, and during this process,
the tick should not be crushed or popped [which would spread infected
contents onto the skin. - Mod.JW].

- Ticks should not be collected and squeezed with bare hands [for the
same reason as above. - Mod.JW].

- To remove the tick from the body, ether, cologne, gas, oil or
cigarettes should not be applied.

- After any contact with ticks, people must be watched for disease
symptoms for 10 days; if symptoms occur, contact the nearest health
center.

- Farm animals should be disinfected against ticks.

Torunoglu also said during the 1st 5 months of 2009, the number of
cases and deaths due to CCHF decreased [compared with 2008]. According
to records, a total of 1315 cases and 63 deaths occurred in
January-May 2008, but in the same period of 2009, 87 cases and 7
deaths have been recorded.

[Since the previous report on 30 May 2009, there have been 2 more
deaths. However, the government's efforts at increasing awareness of
the hazards of tick-bite may be limiting the number of cases.
