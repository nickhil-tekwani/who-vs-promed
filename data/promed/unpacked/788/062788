The Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) today [23 Aug 2010]
has confirmed a 3rd case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in Barry
County. A 52-year-old woman, who first fell ill in late July [2010]
and was hospitalized, is in a rehabilitation center recovering from
the illness. The previous 2 human cases of EEE are in Kalamazoo
County. A 61-year-old man is home recovering from the illness while a
41-year-old man is in intensive care in a Kalamazoo County hospital.
All human cases have a history of local exposure to mosquitoes. These
are the 1st human cases reported in Michigan since 2002. No further
details about the 3 cases are being released.

The MDCH and the Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA) are
continuing to receive reports of cases of EEE in horses in Southwest
Michigan, including Barry, Calhoun, Cass, Kalamazoo, and St Joseph
counties. EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in
the US, killing 1/3 of those hospitalized with the infection, and
often leaving survivors with lasting brain damage. In the face of this
ongoing outbreak, Michigan residents are urged to take precautions
against mosquito bites.

EEE is spread by mosquitoes and causes inflammation of the horses'
brains and leads to death in up to 90 percent of the cases. People
cannot get the disease from horses, only from mosquitoes.

For more information on the human health impact of EEE, please visit
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's EEE website at
<http://www.cdc.gov/easternequineencephalitis/>.

Eastern equine encephalitis has claimed a victim in North Escambia
[Florida] -- a horse in the Molino area.

The horse was euthanized last week [week of 23 Aug 2010] after showing
signs of EEE, a diagnosis confirmed by laboratory tests, according to
Katie Miller, spokesperson for the Escambia County Health Department.
The horse was pastured on River Bend Road, near the Escambia River,
not fair from Fairgrounds Park.

EEE is a viral disease that affects the central nervous system. Signs
of the virus include fever, listlessness, stumbling, circling, coma,
and usually death. The disease is fatal in horses in 90 percent of
cases and fatal in about 1/3 of human victims. It leaves many
survivors with permanent brain damage.

"There have been no recent human cases in Escambia County," Miller
said. The virus can only be spread by mosquito bites, and is sometimes
spread among horses and birds in species that do not typically bite
humans. Miller said that Escambia County stepped up its mosquito
prevention spraying program in the Molino area last week [week of 23
Aug 2010] in response to the disease confirmation.

Typically 1 or 2 human cases are reported each year in Florida,
according to the Florida Department of Health. The state averages over
70 reported cases of equine EEE each year. In years when conditions
favor the spread of the EEE, the number of reported equine cases can
exceed 200. EEE is not believed to have the potential to cause a human
epidemic in Florida. Miller said it is still a good idea to follow the
"5-D's " of mosquito protection:
- don't go outdoors at DUSK and DAWN when mosquitoes are most active.
DRESS so your skin is covered with clothing
- apply mosquito repellent containing DEET to bare skin and clothing.
Other effective repellents include picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus,
and IR3535.
- empty containers and DRAIN standing water around your home where
mosquitoes can lay eggs.

The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said the
majority of cases of EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases in horses
can be prevented through proper vaccinations. Horse owners are urged
to check with their veterinarian to make sure their animals have
received current vaccinations and booster shots against EEE and West
Nile Virus, and that these shots are kept up to date.

[Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has had far reaching effects this
year (2010), from Florida, to New York to Michigan and many other
states.

Horse owners are strongly encouraged to vaccinate their horses. The
protective ability of the vaccine wanes after about 6 months.
Consequently, more than one vaccine administration is needed to
protect the horse throughout the year, especially when there are many
mosquitoes around.

People should heed warning about using repellents, as it is also a
disease of humans that the mosquito brings to us. - Mod.TG]
