Update: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome --- Toronto, Canada,
2003
-----------------------------------------------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized in
Toronto in a woman who returned from Hong Kong on 23 Feb 2003
(1). Transmission to other persons resulted subsequently in an
outbreak among 257 persons in several Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
hospitals. After implementation of provincewide public health
measures that included strict infection-control practices, the number
of recognized cases of SARS declined substantially, and no cases
were detected after 20 Apr 2003. On 30 Apr 2003, the World Health
Organization (WHO) lifted a travel advisory issued on 22 Apr 2003
that had recommended limiting travel to Toronto.
This report describes a second wave of SARS cases among
patients, visitors, and health-care workers (HCWs) that occurred at
a Toronto hospital approximately 4 weeks after SARS transmission
was thought to have been interrupted. The findings indicate that
exposure to hospitalized patients with unrecognized SARS after a
provincewide relaxation of strict SARS control measures probably
contributed to transmission among HCWs. The investigation
underscores the need for monitoring fever and respiratory
symptoms in hospitalized patients and visitors, particularly after a
decline in the number of reported SARS cases.
During 23 Feb - 7 Jun 2003, the Ontario Ministry of Health and
Long-Term Care received reports of 361 SARS cases (suspect: 136
[38 percent]; probable: 225 [62 percent]) [see Figure 1 at weblink
above for epidemic curve - Mod.MPP]; as of 7 Jun 2003, a total of
33 (9 percent) persons had died. Of 74 cases reported during 15
Apr - 9 Jun 2003 to Toronto Public Health, 29 (39 percent) occurred
among HCWs, 28 (38 percent) occurred as a result of exposure
during hospitalization, and 17 (23 percent) occurred among hospital
visitors [see Figure 2 at weblink above]. Of the 74 cases, 67
(90 percent) resulted directly from exposure in hospital A, a 350-bed
GTA community hospital.
The majority of cases were associated with a ward used primarily
for orthopedic patients (14 rooms) and gynecology patients (7
rooms). Nursing staff members used a common nursing station,
shared a washroom, and ate together in a lounge just outside the
ward. SARS attack rates among nurses assigned routinely to the
orthopedic and gynecology sections of the ward were approximately
40 percent and 25 percent, respectively.
During early and mid-May [2003], as recommended by provincial
SARS-control directives, hospital A discontinued SARS expanded
precautions (i.e. routine contact precautions with use of an N95 or
equivalent respirator) for non-SARS patients without respiratory
symptoms in all hospital areas other than the emergency department
and the intensive care unit (ICU). In addition, staff no longer were
required to wear masks or respirators routinely throughout the
hospital or to maintain distance from one another while eating.
Hospital A instituted changes in policy on 8 May 2003; the number
of persons allowed to visit a patient during a 4-hour period remained
restricted to one, but the number of patients who were allowed to
have visitors was increased.
On 20 May 2003, 5 patients in a rehabilitation hospital in Toronto
were reported with febrile illness. One of these 5 patients was
determined to have been hospitalized in the orthopedic ward of
hospital A during 22-28 Apr 2003, and a second was found on 22
May 2003 to have SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) by
nucleic acid amplification test. On investigation, a second patient
was determined to have been hospitalized in the orthopedic
ward of hospital A during 22-28 Apr 2003. After the identification of
these cases, an investigation of pneumonia cases at hospital A
identified 8 cases of previously unrecognized SARS among patients.
The first patient linked to the second phase of the Ontario outbreak
was a man aged 96 years who was admitted to hospital A on 22 Mar
2003 with a fractured pelvis. On 2 Apr 2003, he was transferred to
the orthopedic ward, where he had fever and an infiltrate on chest
radiograph. Although he appeared initially to respond to
antimicrobial therapy, on 19 Apr 2003, he again had respiratory
symptoms, fever, and diarrhea. He had no apparent
contact with a patient or an HCW with SARS, and aspiration
pneumonia and _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea appeared
to be probable explanations for his symptoms. In the subsequent
outbreak investigation, other patients in close proximity to this patient
and several visitors and HCWs linked to these patients were
determined to have SARS. At least one visitor became ill before the
onset of illness of a hospitalized family member, and another visitor
was determined to have SARS although his hospitalized wife did not.
On 23 May 2003, hospital A was closed to all new admissions other
than patients with newly identified SARS. Soon after, new provincial
directives were issued, requiring an increased level of infection-
control precautions in hospitals located in several GTA regions.
HCWs at hospital A were placed under a 10-day work quarantine
and instructed to avoid public places outside work, avoid close
contact with friends and family, and to wear a mask whenever public
contact was unavoidable. As of 9 Jun 2003, of 79 new cases of
SARS that resulted from exposure at hospital A, 78 appear to
have resulted from exposures that occurred before 23 May 2003.

MMWR Editorial Note:
--------------------
On 14 May 2003, WHO removed Toronto from the list of areas with
recent local SARS transmission because 20 days (i.e., twice the
maximum incubation period) had elapsed since the most recent
case of locally acquired SARS was isolated or a SARS patient had
died, suggesting that the chain of transmission had terminated.
Before recognition of the second phase of the outbreak, the most
recent case of locally acquired SARS in Toronto was reported
before 20 Apr 2003. However, unrecognized transmission, limited
initially to patient-to-patient and patient-to-visitor transmission,
apparently was continuing in hospital A. After directives for
increased hospitalwide infection-control precautions were lifted, an
increase in the number of cases was observed, particularly among
HCWs.
The findings from this investigation underscore the importance of
controlling health-care--associated SARS transmission and highlight
the difficulty in determining when expanded precautions for SARS
no longer are necessary. Investigations in Canada and other
countries have identified HCWs to be at increased risk for SARS,
and methods for performing surveillance among HCWs have been
recommended (2). The Toronto investigation suggests that
unrecognized patient-to-patient and patient-to-visitor transmission of
SARS might have been occurring with no associated cases of HCW
illness until after a provincewide lifting of the expanded precautions
for SARS. Transient carriage of pathogens on the hands of HCWs
is the most common form of transmission for several nosocomial
infections, and both direct contact and droplet spread appear to be
major modes for transmitting SARS-CoV (3). HCWs should be
directed to use gloves appropriately (e.g., change gloves
after every patient contact and avoid their use outside a patient's
room) and to pay scrupulous attention to hand hygiene before
putting on and after removing gloves.
In addition to active and passive sureillance for fever and respiratory
symptoms among HCWs, early detection of SARS cases among
persons in health-care facilities in SARS-affected areas is critical,
particularly in facilities that provide care to SARS patients.
Identifying hospitalized patients with SARS is difficult, especially
when no epidemiologic link has been recognized and the
presentation of symptoms is nonspecific. Patients with SARS might
develop symptoms common to hospitalized patients (e.g., fever
or prodromal symptoms of headache, malaise, and myalgias), and
diagnostic testing to detect cases is limited. Available nucleic acid
amplification assays for SARS-CoV have reported sensitivities as
low as 50 percent (4). Although serologic testing for SARS-CoV
antibody is available, definitive interpretation of an initial negative
test requires a convalescent specimen to be obtained greater than
21 days after onset of symptoms (5).
Several potential approaches for monitoring patients might improve
recognition of SARS in hospitalized patients. A standardized
assessment for SARS (e.g., clinical, radiographic, and laboratory
criteria) might be used among all hospitalized patients with new-
onset fever, especially for units or wards in which clusters of febrile
patients are identified. In addition, some hospital computer
information systems might allow review of administrative and
physician order data to monitor selected observations that might
serve as triggers for further investigation.
The Toronto investigation found early transmission of SARS to both
patients and visitors in hospital A. In areas affected recently by
SARS, clusters of pneumonia occurring in either visitors to health-
care facilities or HCWs should be evaluated fully to determine if they
represent transmission of SARS. To facilitate detection and
reporting, clinicians in these areas should be encouraged to obtain
a history from pneumonia patients of whether they visited or worked
at a health-care facility and whether family members or close
contacts also are ill. Targeted surveillance for community-acquired
pneumonia in areas recently affected by SARS might provide
another means for early detection of these cases.
The findings from the Toronto investigation indicate that continued
transmission of SARS can occur among patients and visitors during
a period of apparent HCW adherence to expanded infection-control
precautions for SARS. Maintaining a high level of suspicion for
SARS on the part of health-care providers and infection-control staff
is critical, particularly after a decline in reported SARS cases. The
prevention of health-care-associated SARS infections must involve
HCWs, patients, visitors, and the community.

Update: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome --- United States,
June 11, 2003
-----------------
During November 1, 2002-June 11, 2003, a total of 8,435 probable
SARS cases were reported to WHO from 29 countries, including 70
from the United States; 789 deaths (case-fatality proportion: 9.4
percent) have been reported, with no SARS-related deaths reported
from the United States (1).

In the United States, a total of 393 SARS cases have been reported
from 42 states and Puerto Rico, with 323 (82 percent) classified as
suspect SARS and 70 (18 percent) classified as probable SARS
(i.e., more severe illnesses characterized by the presence of
pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome) (2). Of the 70
probable patients, 68 (97 percent) had traveled to areas with
documented or suspected community transmission of SARS
within the 10 days before illness onset; the remaining 2 (3 percent)
patients were a health-care worker who provided care to a SARS
patient and a household contact of a SARS patient (3). Of the 68
probable SARS cases attributed to travel, 35 (51 percent) patients
reported travel to mainland China; 17 (25 percent) to Hong Kong
SAR, China; 5 (7 percent) to Singapore; one (1 percent) to Hanoi,
Vietnam; 14 (21 percent) to Toronto, Canada; and 5 (7 percent) to
Taiwan; of these, 7 (10 percent) reported travel to more than one of
these areas.
Serologic testing for antibody to SARS-CoV has been completed for
134 suspect and 41 probable cases. None of the suspect cases and
8 (20 percent) of the probable cases have demonstrated antibodies
to SARS-CoV, 7 of which have been described previously (3).
The 8th serologically confirmed probable SARS case occurred in a
North Carolina [USA] resident who traveled to Toronto, Canada, on
15 May 2003 and visited a relative in a health-care facility on 16 and
17 May 2003. The relative's hospital roommate and another visitor
in the room during these visits both subsequently had SARS
diagnosed. The patient returned to the USA on 18 May 2003, and
had a fever on 24 May 2003, followed by respiratory symptoms. He
was treated as an outpatient for these symptoms beginning on 27
May 2003, and a chest radiograph on 3 Jun 2003 documented
pneumonia. The patient has remained in isolation at home. All
of the exposed health-care workers and family contacts are under
active surveillance for SARS.
Serologic testing on this patient was negative for antibody to SARS-
CoV at day 10 of illness and positive at day 11. SARS-CoV RNA
was not detected by RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swabs collected from the patients 11 days after onset of symptoms.

Laboratory testing for SARS shows people with mild illness have
been exposed to the virus. 12 Jun 2003
--------------------------------
In a new development in testing for SARS in the UK, the Health
Protection Agency has found antibodies to the SARS coronavirus in
samples taken from 2 people who had had only mild illness. [How
confident are they that these are not false positive results? -
Mod.JW]
Since receiving these positive laboratory results, local investigations
have been undertaken to check that these people had recovered
and that none of their close contacts have suffered any clinical
symptoms of SARS-like illness in recent weeks. Local health
protection teams are satisfied that there has been no ongoing public
health risk.
The development is a significant step in building knowledge about
the behaviour of the SARS coronavirus. A great deal of further
research needs to be carried out before any conclusions can be
reached, but the finding suggests that there is a spectrum of SARS
illness, with a few people only experiencing a very mild illness before
complete recovery.
Dr Maria Zambon of the HPAs Central Public Health Laboratory
said Since early March [2003], we have been carrying out
continuous testing on patients who were classified as probable and
suspected cases of SARS and of the 4 probable cases currently
listed, one was recently reported as testing positive. In addition to
this, we have also received samples from patients with milder
symptoms who had all travelled to areas where SARS cases have
been reported, but are thought to have had limited opportunity for
exposure to the virus. This testing has been undertaken as part of
our precautionary approach to SARS, because so little was known
about the extent to which infection with the SARS coronavirus
might be associated with mild symptoms.
2 such people have tested positive for SARS corona virus through
showing an antibody response to the virus. This shows that these
individuals have almost certainly been exposed to the virus, and
have had a mild illness but have now fully recovered.
One further case who required hospitalisation has also tested
positive for antibodies to SARS coronavirus and has since
recovered. Although these people have almost certainly been
exposed to the SARS coronavirus, they have not been classified as
probable cases of SARS as they dont meet the case definition in
terms of either severity of symptoms or travel history
Dr Zambon concluded It is still early days in terms of testing for
SARS coronavirus, and these results show that there is a great deal
we still dont understand about the spectrum of illness caused by
infection with this virus. The majority of people tested so far have
been very sick in hospital and these latest results may represent
cases at the more mild end of the spectrum. Further testing and
research is needed worldwide before we find out if there are more
people who may have suffered a similar mild illness. We are likely to
find this out in areas where there has been local transmission of
SARS and more people have come into contact with the infection.
We will be sharing our data with WHOs international laboratory
collaboration to see if other countries have had similar cases.
Notes to Editors
-----------
The HPA has also received 2 further positive antibody results on UK
citizens, who were ill whilst outside the UK and were tested on their
return. These people are now recovered and they have been
reported to the countries where they were ill and will not be reported
as UK probable cases. [see report of 2 cases in the Philippines in
yesterday's update (144) [1][A] footnote (1) - Mod.MPP]
While 3 probable SARS cases have tested negative for SARS
corona virus (see second paragraph), WHO advise that they should
remain in the probable category, as we have no other laboratory
explanation for their illness.

[The report on the ongoing outbreak of SARS in Toronto is a
sobering reminder of the difficulties in detection of cases in the
absence of an immediately apparent epidemiologic link to other
cases. It begs the question at what point in time following
presumed/apparent interruption of transmission in an area that had
had local transmission (greater than or equal to 20 days, using the
standard "2 incubation periods" for the definition) an area can
presume that atypical pneumonias are most probably
not due to SARS and therefore SARS level infection control
procedures can be dropped. Not an easy question to answer given
the observed recurrence of active transmission in Ontario.
The finding of 2 cases of mild respiratory illness in the UK with
positive serology for recent SARS associated coronavirus infection
is not surprising. Most diseases have a wide spectrum of clinical
presentation from the asymptomatic and or mild presentations to the
very severe and fatal presentations. The absence of documented
transmission of the virus to others from these mild cases is
reassuring, albeit it is a small number of patients (2) so caution is
necessary in interpreting this observation. Serosurveys in areas that
have had local transmission will be of interest in attempting to
identify the proportion of infections that are mild or asymptomatic. -
