Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has broken out in Livingstone and surrounding
areas. Kalomo District Veterinary Officer Dr Humphrey Mwalemi, in a
statement dated September 16, 1999, announced his department had since
imposed a ban on the movement of livestock, meat and milk from Livingstone,
Zimba and Kalomo.
"This ban remains in force till further notice," Dr Mwalemi announced.
"Those found contravening the ban will bear the full consequences of the
law. The animal and animal products will be destroyed without compensation."
But some residents have complained veterinary officers have teamed up with
Zambia police officers to harass people traveling in the area.
Michael Kabika, a dry fish vendor, said his fish from Simungoma near Mwandi
worth K150 000 had been confiscated by veterinary officers in Kalomo for no
apparent reason.
"They are saying the ban is for livestock, meat and milk products from
Livingstone, Zimba and Kalomo. I have got dry fish from Simungoma I really
don't know why they had to confiscate it," Kabika complained.
Dr Mwaleni sympathized with Kabika and noted his officers were taking the
law a little too far. "I will have to go and talk to the officers,"
promised Dr Mwalemi.
