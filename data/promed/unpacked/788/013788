PHARMACEUTICALS CONTAMINATING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES

The March 21st issue of Science News carries a potentially disturbing report
concerning the discovery of various pharmaceuticals in drinking water
supplies. These drugs include cholesterol-lowering compounds, drugs for
regulating blood lipid levels, analgesics, chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics
and hormones, among others. It is believed that the source of many of these
drugs is the human alimentary and urinary tracts.
According to the story, a recent review in the January issue of Chemosphere
of more than 100 published studies related to these drugs and found
"practically zero" data for gauging the potential toxicity of chronic
exposures to low doses of these compounds in the environment.
Apparently, last July, the FDA decided that unless modeling data suggests
that a drug's concentrations in the environment would reach 1 ppb, a
manufacturer would not have to submit an environmental assessment. The
manufacturer does the modeling.
A report out of Switzerland (March issue of Environmental Toxicology and
Chemistry) now documents fluoroquinolone antibiotics in sewage treatment
plant water in concentrations of 0.5 microgram per liter. Tentatively, the
drug has been identified as ciprofloxacin.
An unanswered question is whether or not antibiotics in environment are
contributing to the growing problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
Will physicians have to consider environmental friendliness in their
prescribing patterns?

[0.5 micrograms/liter exceeds the 1 ppb limit referred to by the US FDA.
This seems like a high concentration to be found resulting from medical use
of ciprofloxacin. Is there a Bayer production facility in Switzerland? -
