Diego Quito Avila, Ecuadorian Center for Biotechnological Research (CIBE), has identified a new virus in papaya plantations. "There is no record of this virus in global databases for any crop. There are viruses in other crops that are distantly related at a genomic level to this new species. So far, we have detected it in Ecuador. Its presence is not known in other regions of the world."

The virus was found by extracting RNA from plants that arrived for analysis of _Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV), which is present globally and is of great economic significance to the trade. "Besides PRSV, there was an RNA of a different size to PRSV," he said. The RNA [is] phylogenetically related to members of the genus _Umbravirus_, with a genome of between 4-5kb. "The form of transmission has not yet been determined, nor has it been determined if it causes symptoms in the plant." He said that studies were underway to find out whether it interacted with PRSV to cause severe symptoms. "We are working to find out what the risk of this virus in papayas is."

"In melons, watermelons and cucumber, we have detected and reported the melon yellow spot virus (MYSV) for the 1st time in Ecuador. This virus was detected 1st in Japan, and only reported in some Asian countries. Including MYSV in routine analysis in our region is of vital importance, as combined with other viruses, they could result in great economic losses."

In tomatillos, he said at least 3 potyviruses had been found, which were currently under investigation to determine their importance and role. "We suspect the presence of additional viruses in this crop, and we are working on determining whether it involves something new," he said.

"Additionally, for the 1st time in Ecuador we reported the _Raspberry bushy dwarf virus_ (RBDV) in commercial Castilla raspberry (_Rubus glaucus_) crops." This is one of the most common viruses in blackberries and raspberries globally. The isolate of RBDV in Ecuador has special characteristics at the genomic level which distinguishes it from isolates from other parts of the world."

"Thanks to funds provided by the International Foundation for Science (IFS), we have [also] been exploring viral diversity in plants native to the Galapagos Islands," he said.

[Viruses of the genus _Umbravirus_ (type species _Carrot mottle virus_) have an ssRNA genome. They do not form conventional particles, but are encapsidated only with a helper virus. They are generally aphid transmitted. Volunteer crop plants and weeds often serve as vector and pathogen reservoirs. Disease management may include cultural methods and phytosanitation to minimise inoculum, as well as vector control. The potential new umbravirus sequences reported above apparently still require confirmation of being associated with a viable and infectious plant virus, since inactive "genetic remnants" can be present in many plant genomes.

_Papaya ringspot virus_ (PRSV; genus _Potyvirus_) is the major limiting factor to production of the crop in many countries. PRSV symptoms on papaya leaves include yellowing, vein-clearing, mottling (which may be considered a "mosaic"-like pattern), and sometimes severe blistering and leaf distortion. Fruit symptoms are striking and consist of dark concentric rings and spots or C-shaped markings. Vigour of trees, life span, and fruit set are usually reduced depending on the age of the plant when infected. Fruit quality, particularly flavour, is also adversely affected. The virus is spread by many species of aphids and with infected plants or seedlings but is not usually seed transmitted.

Potyviruses (type member _Potato virus Y_) are one of the largest and most successful groups of plant viruses. They are often aphid transmitted, but many can also be spread by mechanical means, plant-to-plant contact, or with infected plant material. Due to the wide host range of many potyviruses, weeds and volunteer crops often serve as pathogen reservoirs. Synergistic coinfections with other viruses have been reported. Disease management relies largely on clean planting material and use of resistant crop varieties, but reduction of available virus reservoirs and vector numbers may also be useful.

Melon yellow spot virus is a preliminary member of genus _Tospovirus_ (type member, _Tomato spotted wilt virus_) but still awaits recognition by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Tospoviruses are an extremely important group of plant viruses capable of infecting a large range of crops with serious impact worldwide. They are transmitted exclusively by thrips, which are found worldwide. Weed species can serve as pathogen or vector reservoirs, and tospovirus epidemiology is complex. Disease management of tospoviruses is difficult but may include vector control (for glasshouse crops), use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors, phytosanitary measures, and use of resistant crop cultivars.

_Raspberry bushy dwarf virus_ (RBDV) is the only species in the genus _Idaeovirus_. It is pollen transmitted, both to the developing seed and the mother plant. Susceptibility of different _Rubus_ species and cultivars to RBDV varies. Symptoms may include leaf yellowing, stunting, as well as reduced fruit size and yield. Severe stunting of the plant ("bushy dwarf disease") occurs in co-infection with other viruses (for example _Black raspberry necrosis virus_; unassigned to genus).
