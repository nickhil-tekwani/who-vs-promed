Number of _E. coli_ cases continues to grow
-------------------------------------------
The Calgary Health Region confirms there are now 35 cases of _Escherichia
coli_ O157 infection in the city. But health officials say they still don't
know the source of the contamination. They haven't been able to pinpoint
exactly where the people became sick or exactly what they ate. No single
food item has stood out and more than 5 restaurants are involved. The CHR
says it wouldn't serve any benefit to blame any one establishment.
None of the restaurants was ordered closed. The people that came down with
the [infection] range in age from 5 to 69. 4 people are seriously ill and
are in hospital.

Students wary of _E. coli_
--------------------------
More than 30 cases of _E. coli_ can be traced to 5 city restaurants, the
Calgary Health Authority says, and students at one high school are being
warned to look for symptoms after classmates fell ill.
The CHR believes those who got sick, mostly teens and people in their 20s,
ate tainted ground beef from a single source. The CHR is investigating meat
suppliers and packers in the province, to see whether it can trace the
source. It is not naming the restaurants where the beef was served.
Students at Ernest Manning High School were given notices from the school
asking that they look for symptoms consistent with _E. coli_.

[As the number of reported cases grows, these stories reflect somewhat
mixed messages regarding potential source(s) of the pathogen. It is indeed
possible that if ground beef is involved, it may be related to the large
recall in Canada in Aug 2004. - Mod.LL]
