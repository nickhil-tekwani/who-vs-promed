Amogjar Fever: The Wali on the scene
------------------------------------
The sudden death this morning [5 Nov 2010] of a camel herder and that
yesterday's guide-camel, whose body was burnt publicly by the
veterinarian, has relaunched with a vengeance the serial "weird fever
of Amogjar."

To appreciate the situation himself, to inquire for news of affected
families following the death of some of their members and to calm
somewhat heated minds, the Adrar Wali visited the disputed area this
morning ([Thu 4 Nov 2010]).

The visit [of the Wali] comes after the [visit of the Chief Medical
Officer of PMI from Atar the day before yesterday [3 Nov 2010] and
the visit of the Regional Health Director (DRASS) yesterday [4 Nov
2010]. The Wali was accompanied by the Hakem d'Atar, the regional
army leaders, the gendarmerie, the police, the representative of CSA
and those from the [Ministry of the] Environment. We recall that upon
his return last night [3 Nov 2010], the DRASS [Regional Health Team]
brought with them 2 young children that were immediately admitted to
the hospital in Atar.

In the beginning of the winter season when there is usually a
resurgence of diseases which affect both humans and animals, some
people are concerned about the scourge that killed several animals in
Inchiri, Tagant Dhar Adrar (Ain Savr) and now Baten (Atar-Amogjar),
that it might be more widespread.

Many families[in fact have claimed] some losses due to sudden deaths
in their livestock.

[In the 1st post on this outbreak, there was mention of 3 deaths and
2 additional cases in this outbreak, with presenting symptoms of
fever, arthralgias and vomiting. There were also conflicting reports
on the involvement of camels in the affected area.

In this follow-up newswire there is mention of one additional human
death, and it appears as though there have been livestock deaths
occurring in recent times in the affected area and at least one camel
death (that was cremated/burned). Reviewing prior reports from
Mauritania, ProMED has posted on outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF)
and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Mauritania. The scant
information that has been available on this current outbreak does not
mention hemorrhagic phenomena associated with the fatalities -- while
not ruling out CCHF, the added fact that clinical disease has not
been report in CCHF infections of camels, it makes this diagnosis less likely.

If in fact there has been an increase in livestock (caprines,
camelidae and possibly bovines if there are the herders in the
general area) mortality in the affected areas, it is possible that
there may be ongoing RVF in the affected zones.

Once again, there are many other etiologies for a clinical
presentation of fever, arthralgias and vomiting that should still be
considered in the differential diagnosis. We await results of further
studies, as well as more information on the possibility of a
concurrent increase in livestock mortality.
