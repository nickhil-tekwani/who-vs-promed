Birds / 163 355 / 2273 / 2273 / 0 / 0
Affected population: commercial table eggs layers in a multi-age farm.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 1.4 / 1.4 / 100 / 1.4
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments
Within the framework of passive surveillance of bird diseases, mortality in table eggs layers was reported in a multi-age farm; the birds showed clinical signs compatible with fowl typhoid and necropsy conclusions supported it. Routine bacteriological assays and appropriate biochemical assays identified _Salmonella_ Gallinarum on 26 Aug 2016. The affected farm and the farms within the restriction area have been put under quarantine; surveillance is continuing, sampling included.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; vaccination in response to the outbreak(s); traceability; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

["Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _S._ Gallinarum biovar Gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterised by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

"Clinical signs in chicks and poults include anorexia, diarrhoea, dehydration, weakness and death. Fowl typhoid is a more acute septicaemic condition which mainly affects mature birds and may be particularly severe in commercial laying flocks.

"_Salmonella_ Gallinarum and _S._ Pullorum are host adapted to avian species and are considered to pose a minimal zoonotic risk, although the genome is continually evolving, which could theoretically widen the host range in future. Non-typhoidal _Salmonella_ serovars are normally handled in the laboratory at containment level (CL) 2".

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2016, Chapter 2.3.11 "Fowl typhoid and Pullorum disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.11_FOWL_TYPHOID.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

The affected province (Alajuela) has the highest poultry population in Costa Rica. (Note: See OIE WAHIS database, section Animal population, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation. To view poultry populations, select the country, year, and animal species.)
