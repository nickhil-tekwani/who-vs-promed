MASS MORTALITY IN PENGUINS AND OTHER SEA-BIRDS:RFI
--------------------------------------------------
Date: Sat, 19 Apr 1997 04:21:08 -0400
From: Heather Gardner <heathe_gar@antdiv.gov.au>
I am a veterinary scientist looking at diseases in penguins in Antarctica.
To date I have spent 2 seasons in Antarctica around Mawson working on
Adelie and Emperor penguins. I also have a general interest in diseases of
all seabirds, particularly those that are migratory to the sub-Antarctic
and Antarctic.
I am wishing to update our references on diseases in penguins and create a
data base on disease in these seabirds at the Antarctic Division.
I would be very interested to hear from people who have seen mass
mortalities of birds - adults and chicks - and/or have studied diseases in
seabirds.
