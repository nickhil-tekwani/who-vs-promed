Notes:
Cumulative number of cases includes number of deaths.
As SARS is a diagnosis of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change
over time. This means that previously reported cases may be discarded after
further investigation and follow-up.
[B] Areas with recent local transmission and travel recommendations can be
accessed at: <http://www.who.int/csr/sars/areas/2003_06_13/en/>
The situation in Toronto has been changed since the last update (see below).
Update 80 - Change in travel recommendations for parts of China, situation in
Toronto
For complete information on WHO travel recommendations see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/travel/2003_06_13/en/>
[C] Change in travel recommendations 13 June 2003
Effective today, the World Health Organization (WHO) is removing its
recommendation that people should postpone all but essential travel to Hebei,
Inner Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin regions in China.
Recommendations to consider postponing all but essential travel to these
regions of China were issued on 23 April and 8 May in order to minimize the
international spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). WHO is
changing this recommendation as the situation in these areas has now improved
significantly. Information about the decline of the outbreaks in Hebei, Inner
Mongolia, Shanxi and Tianjin has been carefully reviewed by WHO and suggests
that SARS is no longer a potential threat to international travellers to
these regions.
Recommendations to postpone travel are issued following consideration of
several factors, including the magnitude of current SARS cases, the pattern
of recent local transmission, and the last dates of export of cases.
In addition, WHO is removing Guangdong, Hebei, Hubei, Inner Mongolia, Jilin,
Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi and Tianjin from the list of areas with recent local
transmission. This follows confirmation that there have been no new cases
isolated in any of these areas for more than twice the maximum incubation
period, in other words more than 20 days.
On 27 March 2003, WHO recommended that areas with recent local transmission
should screen all international departing passengers to ensure that those who
are sick with SARS or are contacts of SARS cases do not travel. This
recommendation is still valid for Beijing, Hong Kong and Taiwan in China, and
Toronto, Canada. For a summary of travel recommendations, see the table below.
During a recent trip to Beijing, Dr David Heymann, WHO's Executive Director
for Communicable Diseases, commented on the measures now in place in China to
contain the spread of SARS. "We've seen that there has been a massive effort
to mobilize the population both in urban and rural areas across the country,
encouraging people to monitor themselves for fever and to ensure that SARS
cases are quickly identified, isolated and treated."
"China has made huge strides in its effort to contain the outbreak of SARS,"
said Dr Heymann. "The key thing now is to maintain vigilance and build up
China's disease surveillance system. Public health authorities in China and
around the world must continue to watch out for new cases of SARS to ensure
that it does not emerge again elsewhere."
Situation in Toronto
-------------
The category of pattern of SARS transmission for the city of Toronto
has been changed from "B" to "C". This is because a probable case
with laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus exported from
Toronto had not been previously identified as a contact and put into
voluntary home isolation.
"Pattern B" transmission is defined as an area having more than one
generation of local probable SARS cases, but only among persons who have been
previously identified and followed-up as known contacts of probable SARS
cases.
"Pattern C"
transmission is defined as an area having local probable cases occurring
among persons who have not been previously identified as known contacts of
probable SARS cases.

Situation report on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
June 14, 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
No new confirmed case of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was
reported today (June 14), marking the third consecutive day of zero
infection in Hong Kong. It is also the 30th day in a row on which the
number of case has fallen below five since May 16.
The number of patients recovered and discharged from hospital
continues to rise to 1382. Of them, two were discharged today.
The number of SARS patients in intensive care unit is 16. These cases
are part of the 53 cases under treatment in hospitals. Most of the
patients are showing positive responses to the treatment protocol. In
addition, 26 are recovering patients in convalescence and in
preparation for discharge.
A 69-year-old woman who has a history of chronic disease died in
Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, bringing to 294 the total
number of deaths relating to SARS.
Meanwhile, temperature checks for all passengers at the airport,
ports and border points continue to be implemented to watch for
travellers displaying symptoms of SARS. In addition, all incoming
travellers are required to complete a health declaration. Four
passengers were screened out during temperature checks at these
points yesterday. After undergoing further medical checks, all four
were however cleared of SARS symptoms.
The cumulative total of persons covered by home confinement remains
at 1 262 (from 493 households). Thanks to the co-operation of the
confinees and members of the community, no new warning letter has
been issued since May 16 and the scheme is running smoothly.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with SARS since March 12 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths
(change in past 24 hours presented in parentheses, minus used for decrease)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 386
(0)/ 364 (1)/ (n/a)
Patients, family members & visitors: 1369/ 1018 (2)/ (n/a)
Total: 1755 (0)/ 1382 (2)/ 294 (1)
Total no. patients in hospital: 79 (-3)
Recovering patients in convalescence: 26
Cases under treatment: 53 (-1) (including 16 patients in Intensive Care Unit)
Suspected cases: 1

Health officials say co-worker of US SARS patient dies of pneumonia
----------------------------------------------
A co-worker of the man with the first confirmed case of SARS in North
Carolina died Friday of heart failure and pneumonia, state health
officials said.
The 45-year-old man was one of 2 pneumonia victims who worked in the same
building as the SARS patient. In preliminary tests, both showed no signs of
having SARS, but more thorough examinations were pending, health officials
said.
The SARS patient and the dead man, had overlapping work hours on 3 successive
days last month in the same building at the University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill.
The SARS patient showed no symptoms at the time, and state health director
Leah Devlin said there are no reported cases anywhere in the world in which a
co-worker outside a medical setting passed the disease to a colleague.
The man who died had suffered a chronic cough for weeks and his condition
suddenly deteriorated Monday, the News & Observer reported Friday. State
epidemiologist Dr. Jeffrey Engel would only say Friday that they were still
investigating the background of his condition.
The 2nd pneumonia patient was being monitored at home after being treated
at Duke University Medical Center.
"Follow-up testing is being conducted to see if we can completely rule out the
possibility of SARS in both cases," Devlin said.
["Very peliminary" tests from CDC] showed both men negative for SARS; the
same kind of test, involving swabs from the nose or the back of the throat,
confirmed the diagnosis of SARS in the first man.
"Right now we're calling it definitely heading down the right track," Engel
said. "But you cannot rule out a case of SARS until several days after the
initial onset of illness."
Blood test results from the CDC on the 2 pneumonia patients could be back as
early as Monday. Engel said the most conclusive test can only be done 21 to 28
days after onset of symptoms.
The SARS patient and the dead man had overlapping work times May 21-23 in the
Giles F. Horney Building, which houses facilities services offices off the
university's main campus. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health and
Human Services, Carol Schriber, said she did not know how long the men were in
the same building. "The disease investigation so far has not shown close
personal contact between the two people," Schriber said.
The university has offered health screenings to 500 employees who worked in
the building or for the energy services department, as well as their immediate
family members. As of Friday afternoon, 35 people had been examined and none
showed symptoms related to SARS.
The SARS patient, an Orange County resident, could be released from isolation
at home on Saturday -- 10 days after his last symptom disappeared, state
health officials said.
Test results from the CDC confirmed the Orange County man's diagnosis Monday,
making him the 8th confirmed case of SARS in the United States. He
apparently contracted SARS after encountering an infected person during a
visit to a Toronto geriatric rehabilitation center. None of his family has
shown any symptoms. State health officials quarantined 12 people at an Orange
County doctor's office, 3 from a UNC-CH hospital and 2 family members of the
SARS patient. The quarantine was to end Saturday.
Also, 9 members of the staff at Duke University Medical Center and 2 at
Western Wake Medical Center were being monitored for symptoms. 4 health
care workers at Western Wake were on furlough because they had close exposure
to the man who died, though they did not show any symptoms of SARS.

[As of yesterday, the number of SARS cases worldwide stood at 8454, with only
10 new cases from around the world. The reassignment of Toronto to category
C (disease occurring in those not previously known to have had contact with a
SARS patient) is indicative of the seriousness with which WHO views the
situation in that area. If the North Carolina contact of the SARS case in
that state is confirmed to have had SARS, it will represent the first U.S.
death from this disease. - Mod.LM]
