Natural Occurrence of Viruses in _Lycopersicon_ spp. in Ecuador
---------------------------------------------------------------
S. Soler, C. Lopez, and F. Nuez, Centro de Conservacion y Mejora de
la Agrodiversidad Valenciana (COMAV), Camino de Vera 14, 46022
Valencia, Spain. Plant Dis. 89:1244, 2005; published on-line as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-1244C. Accepted for publication 26 Jul 2005.

The Andean region is home of important genetic diversity for the
genus _Lycopersicon_. A survey of 3 asymptomatic populations of _L.
hirsutum_, 17 of _L. parviflorum_, 188 of _L. pimpinellifolium_, and
4 cultivated populations of _L. esculentum_ was made in 9 departments
of Ecuador.
Samples were analyzed serologically for Tomato spotted wilt virus
(TSWV), Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV),
Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), Potato virus Y (PVY), Potato virus X
(PVX), Groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV), Tomato chlorosis spot virus
(TCSV), and Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV). Samples positive as
determined using double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (absorbance values 3 times higher than negative controls) were
analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) with virus-specific primers.
_L. pimpinellifolium_ was the only species of the 4 found to be
infected with viruses. In the department of Manabi, ToMV was detected
in 15 of 16 plants from one population, but only a single plant was
infected with PepMV. In this department, PepMV was also detected in a
single-plant population that corresponded to a volunteer plant found
in the wild and TSWV was detected in another plant. In Esmeraldas and
Guayas, 2 single-plant populations were found infected with PepMV and
CMV, respectively. TMV, PVY, PVX, GRSV, and TCSV were not detected in
this survey.
Specific primers were selected for ToMV (To1/To2, genome coordinates
3498-3518/4902-4922, AJ417701), PepMV (Pe1/Pe2 genome coordinates
5030-5050/5913-5935, AJ606359), CMV (Cm1/Cm2 genome coordinates
541-561/1756-1779, D00356), and TSWV (Ts1/Ts2 genome coordinates
4078-4101/4738-4769, AF208498). Amplicons of the expected size were
obtained using RT-PCR and then cloned and sequenced.
DNA fragments of ToMV, PepMV, and TSWV showed identities greater than
99 percent with respective sequences in the GenBank database. The
highest identity of the CMV DNA fragment was 92 percent with an
isolate from Indonesia (AB042292).
The occurrence of viruses such as CMV, ToMV, and TSWV in coastal
Ecuador was not surprising. However, infected plants were not found
among the samples collected in the departments of Azuay, Carchi, El
Oro, Imbabura, Loja, and Pichincha in eastern Ecuador. _L. chilense_,
_L. chmielewskii_, _L. parviflorum_, and _L. peruvianum_ were
previously reported as natural hosts of PepMV in central and southern
Peru (2), and the virus was also detected in _L. esculentum_ in Chile
(1).
Our results show that PepMV now occurs in wild _L. pimpinellifolium_
populations along the Pacific coast of the South American continent
and that it must have efficient means of transmission, although no
specific vectors have as yet been identified for this virus.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of PepMV in Ecuador and _L.
pimpinellifolium_ as a natural host of PepMV.

[The significance of this report is that PepMV has been detected for
the 1st time in Ecuador in wild populations of _Lycopersicon
pimpinellifolium_ along the Pacific coast of the South American
continent. Potexviruses are extremely infectious but they are not
known to be naturally spread by vectors. PepMV is easily spread via
contact with infected plants. PepMV has been detected in the potato
cultivar 'Yungay' growing in the Andes in Peru. Moreover, 14 percent
of tested accessions in the potato germplasm at the International
Potato Center in Peru are infected with PepMV. More research is
required to determine the risks of PepMV infection in potato. Spread
from tomato to potato may be possible under field conditions in
southern Europe.
PepMV induced serious losses in tomato fruit quality in trials at
Efford in the UK in 2003. In the 'worst case' scenario, these losses
could be in the order of GBP 37.5 million [USD 64.4 million] in the
GBP 79 million [USD 135 million] UK industry, assuming that the
disease becomes endemic in all tomato fruit production areas. In
practice, losses may not be as great. Because the UK industry is
based almost exclusively on production of high-quality fruit, with
virtually no tomato processing industry, any losses of quality would
be significant. Any drop in quality could be catastrophic for
producers.
Contrary to experimental results in the UK, numerous field and
several experimental observations in the Netherlands and a few other
EU countries indicate that PepMV has only a very minor or a
non-significant economic impact on tomato production on average. More
damage might be expected if PepMV-affected plants are also attacked
by _Verticillium_ sp.
The economic impact due to PepMV is also influenced by the marketing
system in a country. In the UK, only Class 1 fruit is profitable.
This is not the case in several other EU Member States where, as a
consequence, the grower can still profitably sell fruit of less than
top quality.
