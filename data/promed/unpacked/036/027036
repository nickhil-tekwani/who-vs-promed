More than 500 inmates at a prison in Hiroshima have contracted food
poisoning, local health center officials said. None of them are in a
serious condition. The Hiroshima Municipal Health Center has ordered
Hiroshima Prison to temporarily close its kitchen.
Inmates began to complain of high fever and diarrhea on Wed 1 Aug
2007. The prison authorities later confirmed that 542 of its 1559
inmates are suffering from food poisoning.

[The etiology of this presumed foodborne outbreak which has affected
about 35 percent of the inmates is not yet established. The
combination of fever and diarrhea could be caused by bacteria such as
salmonellosis or viruses such as norovirus disease.
The Japanese city of Hiroshima is the capital of Hiroshima
Prefecture, and the largest city in the Chugoku region of western
Honshu, the largest of Japan's islands. It is most known throughout
the world as the first city in history subjected to nuclear warfare
with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.
In 3 days will be the 62nd anniversary of the bombing (6 Aug 1945).
