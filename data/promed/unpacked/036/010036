[It is unfortunate that the woman who was infected with Ebola in the health zone of Komanda left the area to seek care in a new health zone, Nyankunde Health Zone in Ituri Province, where she died from the disease. It is now a waiting game to see whether health care practitioners who cared for her in Nyankunde were inadvertently infected. Unless people understand the implications of such behavior, it will be difficult to prevent the virus from continuing to spread.

According to Helen Branswell@HelenBranswell (https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell): "The health workers at Nyankunde Reference General Hospital, where the woman diagnosed with #Ebola in Komanda fled for care, were NOT vaccinated. MOH spokeswoman @jess_ilunga tells me they will be offered vaccine." - Mod.LK]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated 21 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 567, of which 519 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 347 deaths (299 confirmed and 48 probable) and 197 people cured.
- 113 suspected cases under investigation.
- 4 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Beni, 1 in Komanda and 1 in Katwa.
- 4 new confirmed case deaths, 2 in Butembo, 1 in Beni (1 community death) and 1 in Komanda (1 community death).
- 2 new people healed out of Butembo CTE.

News of the response
---------------
Evolution of the epidemic
All 99 contacts in the Mutwanga Health Zone came out of the 21-day follow-up period. Only 3 confirmed cases, 2 of which died, were reported in this health zone. In all 3 cases, these were people from Beni who had traveled to Mutwanga either to avoid follow-up of contacts or to seek treatment. These sporadic cases have not led to the spread of the epidemic on a larger scale in this area thanks to rapid intervention by response teams to isolate patients, identify and track contacts, vaccinate identified contacts and front-line service providers, decontaminate residential and treatment sites, and bury the dead in a dignified and secure manner.

The epidemiological situation has improved significantly in the health zone of Beni, which has reported 4 new confirmed cases in the last 7 days. The highest peak in Beni was reached during the week of 15 Oct 2018, during which 26 new confirmed cases were reported. However, the situation remains worrying in the health zones of Butembo, Katwa and Komanda, which are the main hot spots of the epidemic.

[The successful control of Ebola in Mutwanga Health Zone is a credit to contact tracing and the vaccination effort. The 3 cases were imported and were not local, and there were no contact infections. That is great news. - Mod.LK]

The Ministry of Health and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have taken steps to prevent the spread of Ebola in the epidemic areas on election day, the Deputy Coordinator of the National AIDS response, Dr. Justus Nsio, said on Wed 19 Dec 2018.

According to him, the number of polling stations will be revised upwards, and a handwashing device will be deployed at the entrance of the voting sites located in the areas affected by the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.

"1st, to prevent crowding, the number of polling stations in the epidemic areas has increased, and secondly, every household's infection prevention and control commission will be deployed to put in place hand-washing devices and also, in areas that are difficult to access detergents, hand sanitizers for each individual who arrives and accesses the polling station," said Dr. Justus Nsio.

He also noted that steps are being taken to avoid crowds on polling day. "This question was on the menu of several strategic meetings at the level of the Ministry of Health, which led to the establishment of a cell, CENI-Ministry of Health, which assessed the best ways to avoid contamination during this day, when every citizen must fulfill his civic duty."

[3] Women fight against Ebola

For the past 12 years, [Mama Mwatatu] has hosted a call-in radio talk show called "Women and Development" and has a devoted audience, earning her the nickname Mother Counsellor of Beni.

In normal times, she dispenses advice on health, relationships and child-rearing. [But since Ebola, Mama Mwatatu teamed up with WHO's community engagement team, and her 2 weekly shows expanded from 30 minutes to an hour.

"It's the 1st time in an Ebola outbreak that so many women have been infected," says Julienne Anoko, a social anthropologist working for WHO. "We've never seen this before."

In previous outbreaks, the toughest opponents to First Responders have been mostly men, but another singularity of this outbreak is that women have often been the most hostile.

In Beni, it's the women who run the households. They look after the children, and they care for the sick. If a mother herself falls sick, she'll hand over her children -- who may possibly already also have Ebola -- to a neighbour who will mind them along with her own. This is one way the disease has spread.

"We discovered that women are very reluctant to let the sick go outside the home for treatment, because, to them, that signifies they've failed in their duty to look after the patient," says Ms Anoko.

Women are also the chief mourners when a family member dies, weeping over the deceased and preparing the body for burial. This can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola.

She started working with the Collectif des Associations Feminines (CAF), an umbrella association of about 45 local groups. WHO educated 132 women leaders from CAF about the disease, and then the women conducted an intensive 2-week information campaign in 30 Beni neighbourhoods, including the most dangerous and insecure ones.

Going door to door, the women visited 2900 households in the 1st 3 days of the campaign, engaging with almost 13 000 people. In the following 12 days, in meetings at churches and markets, they reached more than 600 000 people, explaining Ebola vaccines, contact tracing, the treatment of Ebola, and the vulnerability of women and children to the disease.

"I really want these women leaders at the senior management coordination table helping to drive the response," Anoko says.

[Women are often the key to taking action to protect the health of the family and community. With dengue, children are taught how to prevent the breeding of the vector mosquito, which information they bring home to their mothers, who then take it into their hands to effect change. Similarly, if women can be educated about the risk of common practices that facilitate the spread of Ebola virus, it is likely to have a greater impact than if strangers come into the villages to enforce change. - Mod.LK
