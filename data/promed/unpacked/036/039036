Death of more than 100 goats in villages close to Dukura forest in the last couple of days in Mayurbhanj district [Odisha state] has led to fear of anthrax outbreak. Forest and veterinary officials, though, are yet to ascertain the cause of deaths. The carcasses were 1st spotted in Mahalibasa village and later, nearby villages also reported sudden deaths of goats. Though no visible [signs] of any disease was found, villagers said the animals developed swelling in the neck and stomach and died. A team of experts from Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI) in Cuttack visited Mahalibasa village.

The 2-member team comprising Sambit Mishra and Kailas Chandra Samanta collected blood samples of 3 dead goats and sent those for tests. Forest officials do not rule out anthrax as 5 elephants in Mayurbhanj district had reportedly died of the disease in the last couple of years. Of the 5 jumbos, 4 were from Dukura range under Baripada forest division.

Veterinary doctor in Khunta village, Suvendu Ghosh said a vaccination drive was conducted in Khunta and Dukura areas after detection of anthrax in elephants. Though the demand for mutton is high during New Year and marriages, people have stopped buying it in Dukura and Khunta villages out of fear of contracting the disease.

[Goats normally get anthrax through browsing bush leaves contaminated from vomiting blow flies that had just fed on a dead deer. Ten sick and dead goats over "the last couple of days" I might expect, not more than 100. So I suspect another cause that has yet to be identified. There is obviously more to this event than our Indian colleagues have been able to share. But as you can see from recent ProMED postings below, anthrax is common in Odisha.
