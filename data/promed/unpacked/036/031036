A new report shows 200 people reported food poisoning symptoms after dining at one of Las Vegas' most popular restaurants about a block off the Strip. Southern Nevada Health District data released Fri 10 May 2013, show the salmonellosis outbreak at the Firefly restaurant in late April 2013 was more extensive than previously thought. An earlier report showed nearly 90 people sick. Officials say patrons reporting illness hailed from 20 different states and 2 foreign countries.

Investigators say they haven't pinpointed a menu item or ingredient that's the likely culprit. Inspectors who visited the restaurant on 26 Apr 2013 documented food stored at improper temperatures and employees handling food without gloves.

The restaurant was one of Vegas' most highly rated eateries on the review site Yelp.com. Health District spokeswoman Stephanie Bethel says it was shuttered 26 Apr 2013 and remains closed.

[The serotype of _S. enterica_ in this outbreak has not been stated. Given the location of the restaurant (on the Las Vegas Strip) and its apparent popularity, it is not at all surprising that cases have been diagnosed in multiple states as well as internationally. We await more information regarding potential vehicles of transmission. - Mod.LL
