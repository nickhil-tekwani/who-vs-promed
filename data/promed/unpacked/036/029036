A bubonic and septicemic plague cluster has been noted in the Ituri endemic focus of Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Djugu territory, on 14 Jun 2020 by the Lokpa health center nurse (N 2 deg 01' 34.0" E 30 deg 54' 35.4", 2082 m).

On 15 Jun 2020, a team composed of 2 laboratory technicians, the head nurse of the Rethy General Reference Hospital and the Center for Neglected Tropical Diseases (Rethy HGR-CRMT) and a sanitation officer of the Rethy health zone, investigated the outbreak site and tested 6 patients for plague with a rapid diagnostic test. As of 16 Jun 2020, of the 10 cases (of which 4 deaths were reported), 8 were diagnosed with bubonic plague and 2 were diagnosed with septicemic plague.

Three suspect patients came from Bbala village (N 02 deg 01' 53.4" E 030 deg 54' 32.9", 2093 m asl), 5 from Zambi village (N 02 deg 02' 21.7" E 030 deg 54' 30.2", 1993 m asl), 1 from Dzavikpa village (N 02 deg 01' 16.3" E 030 deg 54' 53.4", 2083 m) and 1 from Kpagboma village (N 2 deg 00' 38.7" E 30 deg 54' 35.7", 2066 m asl).

The index case seems to be a 4 year old boy coming from Zambi village (Lokpa health area) who died on 11 Jun 2020; samples were not taken. On 14 Jun 2020, his 41 year old father also succumbed to the disease, which prompted the head nurse of the Lokpa health centre to alert the heath authorities of the Rethy health zone. The saliva sample tested positive for plague with a rapid diagnostic test performed on the deceased on 15 Jun 2020.

In total, the investigation team tested 6 patients (2 deceased), and 4 (2 from Bbala and 2 from Zambi) were positive for plague (blood, saliva or bubo aspirate). All contacts who had attended the funeral wake of the deceased and from active cases' households were administered chemoprophylaxis (doxycycline or cotrimoxazole according to age), and houses of the patients were disinfected. People have confirmed recent rat die-off in Bbala and Zambi villages.

The investigation team is monitoring the outbreak despite the insecurity in the region and the lockdown measures due to COVID-19.

[ProMED thanks the contributors for this post of a new outbreak of plague in the endemic area of Congo DR.

The bacterium that causes plague is _Yersinia pestis_. Most cases of plague are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being bitten. At this point in the illness, there is no risk of person-to-person spread, so if this was indeed a case of bubonic plague, no isolation or quarantine is necessary.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may produce bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this case, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia.

Patients with primary pneumonic plague generate large quantities of infectious aerosols that pose a significant risk to close contacts.

CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) guidelines identify contacts within 2 meters (6.5 ft) as being at greatest risk and do not consider the organism likely to be carried through air ducts or vents. Persons who have been in contact with pneumonic plague patients or handling potentially infectious body fluids or tissues without appropriate protection should receive preventive antimicrobial therapy. The preferred antimicrobial agents for prophylaxis include tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. - Mod.LL
