[1] Bolivia (Santa Cruz, Beni, La Paz)
Date: Tue 12 Apr 2011
From: Juan Saavedra Quintanilla <jsquinta@intramed.net> [in Spanish,
trans. Mod.TY, edited]


Up to 8 Apr [2011] (13th epidemiological week), 11 341 probable
dengue cases have been reported, with 2280 confirmed and 27 deaths.
These numbers exceed the total numbers of dengue cases of 2010, which
were more than 9000 cases.

The departments [state or province equivalent] most affected are
Santa Cruz de la Sierra with 5727 probable cases, 1404 confirmed cases
and 11 deaths; Beni with 3269 probable cases, 314 confirmed cases and
14 deaths, and La Paz reports 993 probable cases, 308 confirmed cases
and one death.

More than 80 per cent are due to [dengue virus] serotype 2 and the
rest for serotypes 1 and 3. In the Caja Petrolera de Salud (Santa
Cruz) Hospital, more than 80 per cent of admitted patients have a
positive tourniquet test, minor mucosal bleeding, thrombocytopenia and
ascites, vascular wall edema and/or plural leakage as a manifestation
of increased capillary permeability. According to the WHO
classification, this corresponds with DHF grades I and II; more than
50 per cent have elevated transaminases, and about 75 per cent of the
admitted patients indicate that this is their 1st dengue episode.

Vector control and other measures are being intensified to deal with
this [situation].

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Saavedra for this firsthand report of the
dengue outbreak in Santa Cruz and La Paz departments. One hopes that
this epidemic in the Santa Cruz department is not as severe as ones in
the recent past, which have filled hospital beds there and overtaxed
health care systems.
