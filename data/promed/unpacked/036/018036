As reported previously, there have been 6 horses with clinical neurological
symptoms submitted in the last couple of weeks to one of the Virginia Dept.
of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) laboratories. To date 5 of
those horses have histologic lesions indicative of a viral encephalitis and
one appears to have suffered intracranial hemorrhage. Tissues from 5 of the
horses have undergone further virus isolation and identification attempts
with 3 now confirmed as Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus infected.
Of the remaining 2, one was the horse with intracranial hemorrhage and the
other was a horse with compatible histopath lesions in the brain. There was
insufficient fresh tissue available on the 6th horse for virus isolation to
be attempted though that animal did have compatible histologic lesions of
encephalitis.
All of these horses are from the southeastern area of the state, from
Petersburg east to the coast. There are 2 more horses from the same area
with clinical histories of neurological symptoms being submitted today to a
VDACS lab for workup. Unfortunately this has been a very good spring and
summer for growing mosquitos in Virginia, warm and wet. Also, so far for
the cases on which we have been able to get any sort of vaccination
history, it appears that none of these horses was vaccinated for EEE in the
past year. We routinely recommend owners vaccinate for EEE twice a year in
the endemic area of the state and at least once a year elsewhere.
Comments from the staff of the National Veterinary Services laboratory
where the virus isolation was carried out indicated too that this strain of
the virus produced cytopathic effects in the cell cultures in only 2 days
so we may have a particularly efficient virus in circulation this year.
This outbreak has been covered extensively in the local media and it is
hoped this will educate horse owners to vaccinate their animals as well as
take preventative measures themselves against mosquito bites.

[From a previous posting: "Vaccinating horses is the best way to prevent
the virus," Wichman said. "It creates a preventability bar so it's less
likely to reach us as people," Wichman said. "Mosquitoes can bite horses
and transmit it right back to us."
The validity of the statement regarding the protective value of vaccinating
horses against Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus for preventing human
cases is highly questionable. Although some horses may have virus titers
sufficient to infect some vector mosquitoes, the most important amplifying
hosts for EEE virus are undoubtedly wild birds.

In response to the spectrum of susceptible species to EEE mentioned in this
posting, a small correction would be that some farm animals, i.e., cows and
pigs, are susceptible to EEE infection.

The recent posting (8/1) [East. equine encephalitis, horses - USA
(Virginia) 2000.3063 based on an article in the Virginia Pilot contains an
error. [An Outer Banks woman died of EEE, while Outer Banks is actually in
North Carolina. The laboratory results reported by the Virginia State
Laboratory (Division of Consolidated Laboratory Services) were negative for
EEE by EIA (Enzyme Immuno Assay). The results were also confirmed negative.
We forwarded samples to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
and they concurred with our results. The screening assay (MRL Diagnostic
Company) performed in a private laboratory was positive for EEE.
