Abstract
Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) is a methodology used to organize and
analyze scientific information to estimate the probability and severity of
an adverse event. Applied to microbial food safety, the methodology can
also help to identify those stages in the manufacture, distribution,
handling, and consumption of foods that contribute to an increased risk of
foodborne illness, and help focus resources and efforts to most effectively
reduce the risk of foodborne pathogens. The term Process Risk Model (PRM)
is introduced in this paper to describe the integration and application of
QRA methodology with scenario analysis and predictive microbiology to
provide an objective assessment of the hygienic characteristics of a
manufacturing process.
The methodology was applied to model the human health risk associated with
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 in ground beef hamburgers. The PRM incorporated
two mathematical sub models; the first was intended to describe the
behavior of the pathogen from the production of the food through
processing, handling, and consumption to predict human exposure. The
exposure estimate was then used as input to a dose-response model to
estimate the health risk associated with consuming food from the process.
Monte Carlo simulation was used to assess the effect of the uncertainty and
variability in the model parameters on the predicted human health risk.
The model predicted a probability of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome of 3.7
x10(7) and a probability of mortality of 1.9 x10(7) per meal for the very
young. These estimates are likely high for all hamburger meals, but may be
reasonable for the home-prepared hamburgers described by this model. The
efficacies of three risk mitigation strategies were evaluated by modifying
the values of the predictive factors and comparing the new predicted risk.
The average probability of illness was predicted to be reduced by 80% under
a hypothetical mitigation strategy directed at reducing microbial growth
during retail storage through a reduction in storage temperature. This
strategy was predicted to he more effective than a hypothetical
intervention which estimated a plausible reduction in the concentration of
_E. coli_ Ol57:H7 in the feces of cattle shedding the pathogen and one
aimed at convincing consumers to cook hamburgers more thoroughly. The
conclusions of this approach are only accurate to the extent that the model
accurately represents the process.
Currently, uncertainty and ignorance about the hygienic effects of the
individual operations during production, processing, and handling limit the
applicability of a PRM to specify HACCP criteria in a quantitative manner.
However, with continuous improvement through stimulated research, a PRM
should encompass all available information about the process, food, and
pathogen and should be the most appropriate decision-support tool since it
represents current knowledge.

[This is a good example of the kinds of things risk assessment should be
concerned with. Risk assessment will likely have a great impact our choices
of control tactics. It will also aid in focusing our surveillance and
monitoring objectives. Finally, it will have a substantial input on how we
will conduct trade in animals and animal products. The inclusion of risk
assessment in the Codex Alimentarius discussion is only one piece of
evidence suggesting the increasing importance of risk assessment for
foodborne disease. There is substantial progress in putting together a
risk assessment for _Salmonella enteritidis_ in shell eggs and egg
products. - Mod.PC
