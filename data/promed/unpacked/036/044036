400 sheep fallen ill with brucellosis destroyed in the Samara region,
8 humans under quarantine
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Management for veterinary and phytosanitary inspection for the
Rosselkhosnadzor [Federal Agency for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance- NP] in the Samara region has reported that more than
400 sheep sick with brucellosis have been destroyed in the Samara
region. " The dangerous infection in the Samara region came from the
adjoining Orenburg [region -NP]. Cattle breeders of the Guskov'
private farm located in settlement of Bugry in the Kinelsky district
brought sheep [infected] with brucellosis to their own farm. After
the disease was detected, the farmers hastily tried to resell the
sick flock in the Kamyshlinsky district for a cheap price. Following
the death of more than 30 animals, veterinarians diagnosed
brucellosis", the agency spokesperson reported.
The veterinary service has informed the Office of the Public
Prosecutor. It was noted that the veterinary science law on
quarantine was broken. The state veterinary inspectors assume that a
criminal case will be opened in connection with this violation of the
quarantine law.
The Rosselkhosnadzor [spokesperson] emphasized that brucellosis in
animals has not been recorded in the Samara region for more than 15
years. "This disease is dangerous for humans also. Brucellosis is
sometimes known as the Maltese fever. It is possible to catch
brucellosis through [consumption of] milk and uncooked meat from sick
animals, and also from direct contact with [the sick animals",
according to Rosselkhosnadzor experts. "Therefore, the 8 people [who
had] direct contact with the infected animals are under quarantine."
Within the coming month it will become clear whether it has been
possible to avoid [further transmission] of brucellosis in the Samara
area. According to the experts, it is good that it is now winter and
sick cattle cannot bathe in the reservoirs as the brucellosis
[organism] is capable of spreading [widely when water is
contaminated. [If the disease has been noted in sheep, why are they
discussing sick cattle? Is there something we are not being told? - Mod. MHJ]

[The Samara region is located in the southeastern part of the
European territory of Russia in the basin of the Volga, the largest
river in Europe. The region has the area of 53.6 thousand sq.km (0,31
percent of the total territory of Russia ). In the north it borders
on the Republic of Tatarstan, in the south - the Saratov area, in the
east - the Orenburg area, and, in the northwest - the Ulyanovsk area.
The Orenburg region is located in the foothills of the Southern Ural
mountains. It borders Kazakhstan in the south, the Samara region in
the west and northwest, and the Republic of Bashkortostan and the
Chelyabisnk region in the north. The total area is 124 000 sq. km.
The population is 2 150 000 inhabitants(2005 census). The capital
city of the region is Orenburg - Ass.Mod.NP]
[If sheep died, this was most probably associated with _Brucella
melitensis_, and not _Brucella ovis_ nor _Brucella abortus_. There
are no reports of _Brucella melitensis for Russia in recent years but
it was a constant from 2004 back. See:

The above mentioned areas border with Kazakhstan on the south and can
be clearly seen on this map. - Mod.MPP]
