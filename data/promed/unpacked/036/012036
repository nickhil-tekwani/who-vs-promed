Other places to read about pneumonic plague are:
1. The series of articles by KF Meyer on experimental infections of monkeys
by various routes;
2. The reports from the CDC (Centers for Disease Control) Division of
Vector Borne Diseases, which show no pneumonic transmission in US settings
recently.

Considerable detail on the Manchurian pneumonic outbreak of 1911-1912 is
also given in Wu Lien-teh's _Plague Fighter: The Autobiography of a Modern
Chinese Physician_ (Cambridge: Heffer, 1959), which is available in many
libraries. Wu was the chief public health officer involved in the outbreak
and went on to a distinguished career in China's National Health Service,
writing the standard pre-World War II texts on both major forms of plague:
_Treatise on Pneumonic Plague_ (1926) and _Plague: A Manual for Medical and
Public Health Workers_ (1936), the immediate forerunner of Robert
Pollitzer's text.
Wu estimated more than 60 000 dead in the outbreak (some 55 000 confirmed,
if memory serves) with about 6 survivors, and noted the dense living
conditions in traditional inns, with many sleeping together on top of the
brick stove/ovens, were a key factor.
A second outbreak at the end of the decade took more than 10 000 lives
before it was contained.
