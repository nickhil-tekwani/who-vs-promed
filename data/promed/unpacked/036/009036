Viet Nam: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 23
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam has confirmed an additional case
of human infection with H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case occurred
in the northern province of Ha Tay in May 2005.

The newly confirmed case brings the total in Viet Nam since
mid-December 2004 to 60 cases, of which 18 were fatal. 4 patients
are undergoing treatment at a hospital in Hanoi.

[On Mon 20 Jun 2005 a Reuters message from Hanoi, citing a local
newspaper, stated that 2 more Vietnamese residents have contracted
avian influenza in the north of the country. These 2 avian influenza
cases were among 5 people who had been admitted to a hospital in
Hanoi with sore throat or bronchitis. It was stated that these 2
additional cases of avian influenza increased the total number of
avian influenza patients in Viet Nam since Dec 2004 to 64, 18 of whom
have died (see: Avian influenza, human - East Asia (91): Viet Nam
20050621.1736).

There is a continuing discrepancy between reports emanating from
official and unofficial sources in Viet Nam and those attributed by
WHO to the Ministry of Health in Viet Nam. It must be presumed that
the difference between the WHO total and local estimates relates to
the number of cases confirmed by laboratory testing. But there is an
unfortunate lack of clarity, which should be resolved if possible. -
