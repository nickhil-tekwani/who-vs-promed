The Tennessee state veterinarian's office's investigation into an equine piroplasmosis (EP) outbreak in a group of racing Quarter Horses has revealed additional EP-positive horses.

So far, 19 horses have tested positive for EP in Middle Tennessee. All are connected to 2 locations in Rutherford County and Bedford County. The investigation is ongoing.

Piroplasmosis is a [parasitic blood infection] that affects equines. Although it can be transmitted through infected ticks, it is currently more commonly spread by blood and blood-products through the sharing of needles, syringes, or improperly cleaned and disinfected dental, tattoo, surgical, or blood-product equipment between infected and uninfected horses.

It can take as long as 30 days for an infected horse to test positive for the disease after exposure. Early clinical signs can range from weakness and lack of appetite to swelling of limbs and labored breathing. Horses that survive the acute phase continue to carry the parasite for an extended period of time. Horses that test positive for the disease are quarantined and could be euthanized.

Horses will not transmit the disease to other horses through casual contact. However, it is critical that horse handlers practice good biosecurity. If needle-use is required, use a new sterile needle and syringe on every horse and clean and disinfect all equine equipment that could be contaminated with blood.

Some states and equine competitions require EP testing for entrance. If you plan to travel with your horse, check with the receiving state for current import requirements.

[Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal infection of horses by _Babesia caballi_ or _Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia equi_) of the phylum Apicomplexa. The 2 organisms may infect an animal concurrently.

Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence [lack of appetite], and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The disease may be fatal in up to 20 per cent of previously unexposed animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _T. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often nonspecific.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in the lungs and signs of pneumonia. In chronic cases, common symptoms include mild anorexia, poor exercise tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen (palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_ merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _T. equi_ merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross." Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films can sometimes be helpful.

Because babesia organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers, serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can distinguish between _T. equi_ and _B. caballi_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and babesia identified either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the spread of tickborne infections. However, preventing the transfer of blood from one animal to another is vital.
