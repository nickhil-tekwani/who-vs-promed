[The city of Jericho is situated about 18 km (11.2 mi) north-east of Jerusalem; see maps at http://mapsof.net/uploads/static-maps/israel_west_bank_gaza_strip_and_golan_heights.png and http://healthmap.org/r/9isW. The site of the outbreak is probably adjacent to the city. Zoom the map by double-clicking on it.

The unofficial message above from Israel's field veterinary services has been circulated to district veterinary offices, practitioners, other animal-health related bodies, and animal breeders in Israel, in order to raise alertness and facilitate timely application of preventive measures. An official report by the Veterinary Services of the Palestinian Authority, which are the official authority in Jericho, including further details, may be expected. We find it appropriate to post the information above at this early stage for the benefit of other regional agencies/authorities; Jericho is situated less than 10 km (6.2 mi) from the Jordanian border.

Genotyping results and comparison of the causative agent with other FMDV-O isolates from the region, particularly with the recent isolate from cattle in Majdal Shams (northern Israel, on Syria's border), are anticipated with interest, to address the source of infection and the vaccine strains of choice.

We have noted that the samples were received at Beit-Dagan 21-22 Nov 2013.

According to our data, the serotype O component in the FMD vaccine, currently used in Israel, is composed of the following 4 strains: O1 3039, O1 Manisa, O 4625 and O1 Israel 2007 (Neve Ur). - Mod.AS]
