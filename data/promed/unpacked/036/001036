Vine disease on the increase in southwest France
------------------------------------------------
A fatal fungal disease known as Esca is ravaging vineyards from
Cognac to Bordeaux, with no cure in sight. On 11 Sep [2008], close to
500 disgruntled winegrowers took to the streets in Gascony, to draw
attention to a fungal disease. Esca, a vine disease that has long
been a concern in France and elsewhere, is on the rise. The problem
has grown since 2001, when sodium arsenite, the only product that
keeps the sickness in check, was banned as a carcinogen. With no
alternative treatment, the disease is on the increase, notably
throughout southwest France, particularly Cognac and Armagnac, but
also in Bordeaux.

Last year's [2007] official estimates indicated that up to 5 percent
of the vineyard surface area in France was affected by Esca. This
year [2008] the figure is expected to increase. "The disease has
spread a great deal over the past 12 months, with up to 40 percent of
some vineyards in Gascony completely destroyed," said Alain Lalanne,
a winegrower actively involved in the demonstration. "We've asked for
the right to temporarily use sodium arsenite, especially as the
health risks are only a concern for those who apply the product to
the vineyard."

Esca is especially prolific in southwest France because it thrives on
the area's chief grape varieties -- Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon
Blanc, and Ugni Blanc. For unknown reasons, Merlot is much more
resistant to the disease.

Alexandre Davy, a vine-growing research scientist in Bordeaux,
explained that esca destroys the woody parts of the vine plant,
either over a number of years or in less than 12 months. "The slow
form of esca can be recognized by yellowish leaves and slow maturing
grapes," he said. "The following year the vine may bounce back and
appear perfectly normal, but the disease appears again, sooner or
later, with fatal results." The 2nd form is much more brutal. "The
vine doesn't produce any grapes at all and usually dies the same
year," he said. The cause of the disease is not understood, though it
may be triggered by one or multiple fungi attacking the vines.

According to the French government's plant protection agency, the
mild and wet springtime weather conditions in southwest France during
the past 2 vintages have favored the disease's development. In
addition, the growers in this area are making the most noise as
Cognac and Armagnac wines require high yielding vines. "Until a new
remedy is found, growers should remove all infected vines, arms, and
cordons as soon as they are identified to stop the disease from
spreading," said Jacques Grosman, a spokesman for the agency.
"Another source of concern are nurseries, as they need to be able to
guarantee that they aren't supplying infected planting material."

Dr Philippe Larignon, who has been researching esca for the past 25
years, said that a replacement for sodium arsenite will be found, but
not in the immediate future. "Laboratories worldwide are looking for
a solution, but only since 2001," he said. "It's true that sodium
arsenite is a miracle product, but as it's much too toxic, there's no
way that growers are going to be authorized to use it again."

[Esca is a disease syndrome involving several fungal species. It is
considered a series of pathological events starting in the nursery
and finishing when the plant is mature. Esca is an important problem
for grape production worldwide and presents 2 different types of
symptoms: one characterised by leaf alterations, the other by sudden
death of the plant.

Species, which have been reported so far to be associated with the
different symptoms in different areas, include _Phaeoacremonium
chlamydosporum_, _P. aleophilum_, _Eutypa lata_, _Stereum hirsutum_,
_Phellinus igniarius_, and _Sphaeropsis malorum_. It is suggested
that the different pathogens play different roles in the process,
which starts with leaf discolourations and eventually leads to wood
degradation.

Where chemical control with sodium arsenite is not permitted,
eliminating infected plants and pruning affected plant parts have
been suggested to control the disease. Removal of infected material
from the vineyard is essential since masses of spores are produced by
the fungi even at low temperatures of 0 deg C (32 deg F). For more
