No cases of livestock foot-and-mouth disease in Armenia
-------------------------------------------------------
At present not a single case of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) or loss
of cattle is registered in Armenia, said first deputy minister of
agriculture of Armenia Grisha Baghiyan in a press conference on Friday
[19 Aug 2011].

Answering the question of the journalists that his announcement does
not correspond the reality in 4 border villages in Gegharkunik region
[east Armenia, bordering Azerbaijan] where there are deaths of cattle,
Baghiyan said that these cases occurred in May of this year [2011] as
a result of other diseases. "In laboratory examinations FMD is not
detected", he said.

"In the village Getik cases of parasitic diseases of blood and in the
village Vahan cases of the disease and death from emkara were
confirmed", he said refraining from announcing the specified number of
deaths. Emkara also known as "blackleg" is an acute, non-communicable
infectious disease characterized by gas crepitant swelling, lameness,
and rapid death of animals.

In this regard Baghiyan said that FMD is a viral disease which is
today found in Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. "In the whole
territory of Armenia preventive measures are implemented for not
allowing FMD to enter the country. A buffer zone is formed on the
entire border with Turkey from Meghri to Ashotsk, as well as in border
areas with Azerbaijan, including Vardenis and Chambarak of Gegharkunik
region", said Baghiyan.

[According to Armenia's annual report for 2010, FMD appears in the
list of diseases "not present during 2010", while the year of its last
occurrence is indicated to be "unknown"; "general and targeted
surveillance" was, reportedly, applied.

The number of animals "routinely" vaccinated against FMD during 2010
was reported as 989 342 bovines; no vaccination in small ruminants was
reported. The national cattle population was reported to be 570 633,
sheep and goats 511 029. It would be interesting to note if the latter
animal species are included in the vaccination scheme, and to obtain
details of the composition of the vaccine applied in Armenia.

Practically surrounded by FMD-endemic countries, as also stated in the
ministerial source above, evaluation of Armenia's actual FMD status
deserves to be supported by active surveillance. Details on activities
undertaken within the declared "targeted surveillance", and results of
tests performed, would be helpful.

According to data on the Armenia page of WRLFMD, FMDV serotype O was
last reported from Armenia in 2000, and serotype A in 2006. No samples
seem to have been submitted. Subscribers are referred to the
exhaustive background information, recently kindly obtained from the
EuFMD (European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease;
