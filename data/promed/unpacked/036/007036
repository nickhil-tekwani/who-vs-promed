The toll of the cholera epidemic which has been raging for a few months in Niger has risen to 83 deaths out of the 2336 cases recorded, i.e. a case fatality rate of 3.55%, as of 28 Aug 2021, we learned on Mon 30 Aug 2021 from the Ministry of Public Health. In total, 6 of the country's 8 regions -- Zinder (east), Maradi (south-central), Dosso (west), Tahoua (center), Tillabery (west) and Niamey, the capital -- are affected by the disease, according to a official report.

Faced with this situation, the government has assured that it has taken measures, including "regular" exchanges with the regional health departments, the pre-positioning of cholera kits, rapid screening tests and the strengthening of stocks in the most vulnerable regions. most affected, the establishment of isolation and care sites in homes or the regular treatment of water points.

The Minister of Public Health, Idi Illiassou Mainassara also appealed to the population to strengthen the rules of hygiene and the use of health services ''before any case presenting signs of suspicion of cholera, namely: diarrhea , vomiting, dehydration.''

He also asked his fellow citizens to "use the toilets and failing this to bury their stools, consume drinking water, wash their hands regularly with soap and water, especially before and after meals, wash their hands regularly after using the toilet, consume sufficiently cooked food, and disinfect raw food before consumption.''

As a reminder, cholera is a bacterial disease causing severe diarrhea which is transmitted through water. The last epidemic in Niger dates back to 2018.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign.

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63,64)."
