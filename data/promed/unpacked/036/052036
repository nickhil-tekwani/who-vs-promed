Manuel Escoffie Pompey, delegate of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA by its initials in Spanish) in Yucatan, reported that as a result of the detection of cases of 'derriengue' [bovine paralytic rabies], mainly in the south of the state, a permanent plan is being implemented to combat bats, which transmit the disease.

In an interview, the SAGARPA official indicated that some cases of rabies had been detected in cattle on a ranch in the municipality of Tzucacab, but that it was being combated through capture of vampire bats.

"The cases, he added, are very few and have always been fought. There is a permanent campaign because bovine paralytic rabies is a threat to all cattle, but in Yucatan there are very few cases and as soon as one is reported, [vampire control measures are implemented."] He insisted that rabies foci have been reduced to a number even too small to become apparent.

[Bat rabies is dangerous to people as well. However, bovines infected with rabies may be a danger to the animal owner or veterinarian. These are large animals compared to a human. They can inflict pain and damage on a human easily and even more so when they may be afflicted with a disease.

The virus causing bovine paralytic rabies is transmitted by _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common vampire bat in the tropics and sub-tropics in the Americas. An image of _Desmodus rotundus_ can be accessed at http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/common-vampire-bat.html.

Vampire bat transmitted paralytic bovine rabies is an ongoing problem in the Huasteca region, which includes parts of the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Puebla, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosi, and Queretaro in northeast Mexico. It is a major livestock raising area in Mexico.

Although the cost of a dose of the vaccine appears to be low, when many head of livestock are involved, the total expense can be considerable, particularly for those livestock raisers of limited financial means. However, the value of one lost animal greatly exceeds the cost of vaccinating a small herd.
