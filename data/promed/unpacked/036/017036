A 3rd person has been diagnosed with monkeypox in England, Public Health England have confirmed.

The latest case is a health care worker who had cared for a patient at Blackpool Victoria Hospital in the north of England before they had been diagnosed.

Earlier this month [September 2018], 2 people were reported to have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK in unrelated cases, with both having contracted the disease in Nigeria before traveling to England. One was a Nigerian resident in Cornwall, followed by the case at the Blackpool Victoria hospital.

"This health care worker cared for the patient before a diagnosis of monkeypox was made," said Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director of National Infection Service at PHE.

"We have been actively monitoring contacts for 21 days after exposure to detect anyone presenting with an illness so that they can be assessed quickly. It is therefore not wholly unexpected that a case has been identified."

The latest patient has been isolated to reduce risk of transmission to others, receiving treatment at a specialist unit at the Royal Infirmary in Newcastle in the UK, according to PHE, who said they are following up with close contacts of the health care worker and tracing anyone who had contact with them 24 hours before they 1st noticed a rash.

"This person has been isolated and we are taking a highly precautionary approach to ensure that all contacts are traced," said Phin.

"The fact that only one of the 50 contacts of the initial monkeypox-infected patient has been infected shows how poorly infectious the virus is," commented Jonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham. "It is wrong to think that we are on the brink of a nationwide outbreak."

Monkeypox is a rare viral infection, similar to human smallpox, that typically occurs in remote parts of central and West Africa, according to the World Health Organization. The virus is mostly transmitted to humans from infected wild animals, such as rodents or monkeys, but can spread from person to person.

Symptoms include fever, muscle aches and rash. People usually recover within a few weeks, though it can lead to serious illness in some cases. Fatality rates are between 1-10% and there is no specific treatment or vaccine for the disease.

[Fortunately, monkeypox virus is not very transmissible between humans, but it can occur as indicated by the above report. The report has good color photographs of the hand lesions that the health care worker developed, accessible at the above URL. The monkeypox virus clade circulating in Nigeria is the West Africa one, that has a very low to nil case fatality rate. Presumably, this is the virus clade involved in these 3 cases. The central Africa clade is more virulent with a case fatality rate of 10% and more.

Nigeria has had many monkeypox cases in 2017-2018, in several states. A recently ProMED-mail post of the situation report issued by the Nigeria CDC stated that a cluster of 6 suspected cases with epidemiological linkages to one of the cases in the UK has been identified in Rivers state and is being investigated in collaboration with the state team. In addition, 2 new confirmed cases have been recorded in Rivers that are not linked to the cluster described above (see <Monkeypox - Africa (14): Nigeria 20180926.6053721>).

Non-human primates are not a monkeypox virus reservoir. The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent, and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Some of these rodents are consumed as bushmeat. - Mod.TY
