Salmonella Goldcoast infections in tourists returning from Majorca
-----------------------------------------------
A total of 178 cases of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Goldcoast
infections have been reported from around Europe to Enter-net
(European surveillance network of enteric infections) since October
2005, and 73 (41 percent) are in patients known to have traveled to
Majorca (Spain).

Health Protection Scotland reported an excess number of serotype
Goldcoast infections through Enter-net on 12 Oct 2005 (1). The Health
Protection Agency's Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens in London has
reported 94 confirmed cases of serotpye Goldcoast in England and
Wales since the beginning of October 2005, compared with 2 cases of
this serotype reported in England and Wales in September 2005. All
isolates tested are fully sensitive to all tested antibiotics.

Since October 2005, Scotland has reported 37 cases (28 with confirmed
travel history to Majorca), Norway 8 (4) cases, Ireland 6 (6) cases,
Sweden 6 (6) cases, Germany 20 (6) cases, Denmark 3 (1) cases and
Finland 4 (4) cases of serotype Goldcoast (above in brackets: number
of cases with confirmed travel history to Majorca). No cases have
been reported from mainland Spain or Majorca.

Provisional data for the isolates in England and Wales indicate that
all age groups were affected, with a high proportion (50 percent) of
children in the 0-4 year age group. There were slightly more males
(54 percent) compared to females (46 percent). The median age of
cases was 3 years (0-76 years). Travel outside the UK was reported by
34 cases (36 percent), and of these, 18 (53 percent) specifically
reported travel to Majorca. Onset dates were available for 15 cases
and were between 30 Sep and 19 Oct 2005. Based on dates when isolates
were received by the Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, cases were
distributed between 1 and 31 Oct 2005 (Figure) [For figure, please

An international outbreak investigation team, including participants
from all aforementioned countries, was convened on 28 Oct 2005 and is
being led by Health Protection Scotland. The Health Protection
Agency's Environmental and Enteric Diseases Department is collecting
descriptive epidemiological data for cases in England and Wales for
the outbreak control team. Detailed, in depth interviews will be
carried out in a small selection of cases to generate an hypothesis
about foods, outlets or other potential sources of infection that
might warrant further epidemiological or environmental investigations.
