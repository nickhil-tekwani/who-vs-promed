Britain will offer a COVID-19 booster shot to all adults in a bid to accelerate its vaccination programme amid concern over the new Omicron coronavirus variant, as 8 more cases were found in the country.

Britain as a whole has reported 11 cases of the new variant, which the World Health Organization said on [Mon 29 Nov 2021] was likely to spread internationally and posed a very high risk of infection surges.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has responded to the emergence of Omicron by making mask-wearing compulsory in shops and on public transport in England.

He also asked the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to review the booster programme, which is currently open to over-40s, the vulnerable and health workers.

The JCVI recommended on [Mon 29 Nov 2021] that boosters be offered to all adults under 40, that the minimum gap between 2nd doses and boosters could be reduced to 3 months from 6, and that 12--15-year-olds could get a 2nd shot.

Health minister Sajid Javid said he would follow the advice, and that those who were most vulnerable would be prioritized for shots, with further details in the coming days.

"There's a lot we don't know about how our vaccine responds to this new variant. But although it's possible that they may be less effective, it's highly unlikely they will have no effect at all against serious disease," Javid told lawmakers.

"With this new variant on the offensive, these measures will protect more people, more quickly, and make us better protected as a nation."

Scotland reported 6 new Omicron cases on [Mon 29 Nov 2021], with 2 further cases confirmed in London, to bring the English total to 5.

The 4 nations of the United Kingdom have all restricted travel to southern Africa, where the variant was first detected last week [w/e 28 Nov 2021], in a bid to slow its spread.

But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said not all of the 6 cases had recent travel history or known links with others who had travelled to southern Africa.

"This suggests that there might already be some community transmission of this variant," she told a news conference.

"There is no evidence yet that this is sustained, nor any evidence from the enhanced surveillance that it is widespread at this stage."

Sturgeon said the timeframe of the cases suggested it was unlikely but not impossible that there was a link to the COP26 climate change conference that took place in Glasgow earlier this month [November 2021].

Asked whether he believed there was community transmission in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman told reporters: "I have got no evidence of that as it stands."

[It's not surprising that community transmission of Omicron is being detected. It will quickly become clear how rapidly this variant spreads in the population. It is incumbent on individuals to get fully vaccinated, wear masks, and avoid large crowds in venues with poor ventilation. - Mod.LK]

[B] UK bracing for hundreds of cases
Date: Mon 29 Nov 2021

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/29/uk-scientific-advisers-brace-confirmed-omicron-covid-cases


Scientific advisers are bracing themselves for hundreds of UK cases of the Omicron COVID variant to be confirmed in the next week or so, the Guardian has learned.

Some of them may predate the earliest cases of Omicron found in South Africa last week but could still be linked to travellers returning from the country, it is understood. Evidence of community transmission also emerged on [Mon 29 Nov 2021].

Omicron, which is believed to be more transmissible than dominant COVID-19 variants and has the potential to evade vaccines, was first reported to the World Health Organization from South Africa on [24 Nov 2021].

The UK is one of the world's busiest air transport hubs and, like South Africa, has a large genomics sector to determine the variants involved in infections - increasing the probability both of importing and detecting cases.

On [Sat 27 Nov 2021], 2 UK cases were announced, rising to 3 on [Sun 28 Nov 2021] - all in people linked to travel to southern Africa. On [Mon 29 Nov 2021] morning, 6 new cases involving the Omicron variant had been identified in Scotland and this time some had no travel history.

The finding has raised concerns Omicron may already be circulating in the community in the UK.

Scientists had previously stressed that while flight bans could delay the importation of Omicron, the variant would nonetheless arrive. It was hoped such measures would buy time and let more people get their booster jabs.

Now the Guardian understands that scientific advisers are bracing themselves for the possibility of several hundred cases of the Omicron variant being detected within days. Other scientists said the spread was difficult to estimate.

Prof. Michael Tildesley, an expert in the mathematical modelling of infectious disease at the University of Warwick and a member of the modelling group Spi-M that advises the government, said: "It is worth remembering, though, that there is a lag between individuals being infected and cases being reported, so at the point that cases are detected, it is likely that there are more infections in the community."

Tildesley added that at this point contact tracing could help to detect how many more cases there might be in the population. "But there is still uncertainty regarding how transmissible this new variant is, how effective the vaccines might be and how severe infection is with Omicron."

Prof. Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh who also contributes to Spi-M, said the discovery of 2 clusters of cases in Scotland - in Lanarkshire and Greater Glasgow - with no obvious links to each other or to travel, suggested at least 2 separate instances of importation. "For the moment, we do have to assume there is further community circulations," he said, adding it would not be surprising to find tens of cases at the moment.

"Of course [if] it does spread rapidly, as initial reports from [South Africa] suggest it can, then it wouldn't take long for it to go into the hundreds," said Kao, adding that if the doubling time for cases was similar to the delta variant, then 25 cases of Omicron now could mean 100 cases in 10 days' time. "At that point, it would be more a matter of slowing, rather than eradicating Omicron in Scotland. Even then, it would probably only be temporary."

But Kao said travel restrictions might still bring benefits, potentially reducing the number of outbreaks and, at least for now, helping stamp them out. "However that is not at all guaranteed, and so, as always, more efforts to reduce spread now, may have big epidemiological benefits later," he said.

"Any measures we put in now may of course, prove unwarranted if in fact, the Omicron variant proves to be sufficiently benign that overall levels of severe infection and hospitalisation stay manageable - but we probably won't know for several weeks."

Some experts have called for robust action, including advice to work from home. Stephen Reicher, a member of the behavioural science advisory group Spi-B, and a professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, said: "With Omicron, even if it turns out to be less serious than we feared, we need to put basic protections in place."

[Prof. Christina Pagel @chrischirp. if we do see 100s of cases in next few days, travel restrictions much less important. We should move to: *in airport* arrival tests for everyone (from any country) boosting asap (govt doing this) reducing community transmission!!

Tulio de Oliveira (@Tuliodna) https://twitter.com/Tuliodna [edited] Today, I spent a big part of my day talking to genomic and biotech companies as soon we will run out of reagents as airplanes are not flying to South Africa! It will be 'evil' if we cannot answer the questions that the world needs about Omicron due to the travel ban! There are more effective ways to avoid introductions of variants (such as pre-and post- arrival tests, vaccinations, self- or forced- isolation) than blanket travel bans. - Mod.LK]

[2] Israel

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/28/israel-to-ban-entry-of-all-foreigners-over-omicron


Israel says it will ban the entry of all foreigners into the country, making it the first nation to shut its borders completely in response to a new and potentially more contagious coronavirus variant.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days.

Officials hope within that period there will be more information on how effective COVID-19 vaccines are against Omicron, which was first detected in South Africa and has been dubbed a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization.

"Our working hypotheses are that the variant is already in nearly every country," Interior Minister Ayelet Shaked told N12's Meet the Press. "And that the vaccine is effective, although we don't yet know to what degree."

The ban will come into effect at midnight on [Sun 28 Nov 2021]. A travel ban on foreigners coming from most African states was imposed on [Fri 26 Nov 2021].

Dr. Ran Balicer, head of the government's advisory panel on COVID-19, told Israel's Kan public radio the new measures were necessary for the "fog of war" surrounding the new variant, saying it was "better to act early and strictly" to prevent its spread.

On [Sat 27 Nov 2021], Israel said it detected the new strain in a traveler who had returned from Malawi and was investigating 7 other suspected cases. The 7 people included 3 vaccinated individuals who all were placed in isolation.

"The entry of foreign nationals into Israel is banned except for cases approved by a special committee," the prime minister's office said in a statement.

Israeli citizens will be required to present a negative PCR test and quarantine themselves for 3 days if they have been vaccinated against the coronavirus and 7 days if they have not. It was only 4 weeks ago that Israel reopened its borders to foreign tourists after a prolonged closure because of COVID.

Al Jazeera's Harry Fawcett, reporting from West Jerusalem, called the new measures "extremely stringent" and said they marked a major reversal of a policy that allowed in foreign tourists at the beginning of [November 2021].

"They are the result of a late night emergency meeting of the coronavirus cabinet, which took place on [Sat 27 Nov 2021] evening after a brief announcement from Naftali Bennett that Israel needed to act very quickly in the midst of all this uncertainty and not risk the progress already gained against the coronavirus."

The new measures will also require all Israelis entering the country, including those who are vaccinated, to quarantine.

Fawcett said Israelis who are vaccinated will have to quarantine for a minimum of 3 days, while those who are unvaccinated will have to quarantine for 7 days.

He added, "And if coming back from one of the newly red-listed African countries, they will have to go into a government quarantine hotel, until they test negative."

Separately, Bennett said the Shin Bet counterterrorism agency's phone-tracking technology will be used to locate carriers of the new variant to curb its transmission to others.

Used on and off since [March 2020], the surveillance technology matched virus carriers' locations against other mobile phones nearby to determine with whom they had come into contact.

Israel's Supreme Court this year [2021] limited the scope of its use after civil rights groups mounted challenges over privacy concerns.

The variant - which has also been detected in Belgium, the Netherlands, Botswana, Hong Kong, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom - has sparked global concern and a wave of travel curbs, although epidemiologists say such restrictions may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally.

About 57% of Israel's 9.4 million population is fully vaccinated, according to the health ministry, which means they have either received a 3rd shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine or it has not yet been 5 months since they received their 2nd dose.

Israel has recorded 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 8000 fatalities since the pandemic began.

Scientists in South Africa said on [Thu 25 Nov 2021] they detected the new B.1.1.529 variant with at least 10 mutations, compared with 2 for delta or 3 for beta.

The strain was of "serious concern" and was blamed for a surge in infections, authorities in South Africa said.

[3] Diagnostic tests

https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/diagnostics-testing/monitoring-covid-variants-to-ensure-test-effectiveness.html


Abbott has been intently monitoring the mutations of COVID-19 so we can ensure our tests can detect them. We have already conducted an assessment of the Omicron variant and we're confident our rapid and PCR tests can detect the virus. While the Omicron variant contains mutations to the spike protein, Abbott's rapid and molecular tests - antigen, PCR and NAAT - do not rely on the spike gene to detect the virus.

Abbott is currently manufacturing more than 100 million COVID-19 rapid and PCR tests a month to help support increased need for testing around the globe.

The process for evaluating variants and stress-testing our tests doesn't stop with the current variants. We are actively collecting real-world samples and using viral cultures to verify that our tests continually detect circulating strains because we know how important it is that our tests can detect new variants regardless of where they are found.

Through Abbott's Pandemic Defense Coalition, we have a network of research, academic and public health collaborators strategically placed around the world that are actively sequencing viruses to look for the next viral threat including COVID variants. Having this established network allows for the quick sharing of new information and the ability to provide samples quickly - within days rather than the typical weeks or months - so we can verify our tests. We are actively engaged with our partner in South Africa on Omicron. This type of global collaboration is critical to fighting these variants and the pandemic.

We also have an entire team of Abbott scientists dedicated to monitoring COVID-19 variants. To date, we have carefully analyzed over 1.4 million sequences from 63 different variants and none have impacted the ability of our diagnostic tests to detect the virus. And as soon as the Omicron sequence was made available, our scientists worked non-stop to evaluate it and determined the mutations would not impact the ability of our rapid and PCR tests to detect it.

Variants have fundamentally changed the landscape and trajectory of the pandemic across the globe. Now more than ever, testing remains a critical part of our COVID-19 response and Abbott's top priority remains making reliable, accessible tests available.

Based on our analysis, the sensitivity and specificity of our tests, including our BinaxNOW rapid antigen tests, are not impacted by the delta variant.

[From Michael Mina @michaelmina_lab, https://twitter.com/michaelmina_lab
Rapid antigen tests detect Omicron. The bulk of mutations in Omicron (i.e. on Spike) are NOT near the sites that most rapid antigen tests pick up (Nucleocapsid protein). Companies are already confirming this, as noted for Abbott in the report above. There is minimal risk a new mutation occurs in a site that one of the numerous antigen tests in the world detects and limits detection. In general, the companies each know the targets of their tests and need to follow and report quickly if an issue comes up. - Mod.LK]
