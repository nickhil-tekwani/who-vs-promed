[These outbreaks in Iraq confirm the published ProMED-mail request for information on a suspect case in this country in July 2013 (archive number 20130718.1831781).

A map showing the outbreaks in the region can be obtained from http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Diseaseoutbreakmaps (Note: to view the information on lumpy skin disease (LSD), you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, the time period, and zoom in).

It should not be unexpected if the disease is reported by other countries in the region, especially Syria. Now that Iraq has reported LSD, all countries bordering Syria are now affected by the disease. Also, see the commentary in ProMED-mail archive number 20131125.2073830.

In response to these outbreaks, the report mentions that beginning in late October 2013, vaccination was applied as a control measure. However, no information on the number of animals vaccinated or on the type of vaccine used is provided. Follow-up reports may possibly provide this information.

For background information including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.4. 14 "Lumpy Skin Disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf (adopted by the OIE World Assembly of Delegates, May 2010).
