A new polio case has been reported by local officials in southern Uruzgan province. Dr. Saifudin, head of the polio campaign for Uruzgan, said on Tuesday [18 Jun 2019] that a 2-year-old child was affected by polio in Meher Abad village of Terinkot city, the provincial capital. "[The family] of the polio-affected kid lives on the outskirts of Terinkot city and they (family) did not have access to health facilities," he said.

Meanwhile, provincial healthcare officials said the anti-polio vaccine was not launched in Mehrab Abad village due to security conditions; thus, a number of children have not received the polio immunization.

Also, the head of the immunization department for the southern provinces has expressed concerns over reports of polio cases in the southern parts of Afghanistan: "7 cases of polio have been registered before; this (polio) is a great threat to the Afghan children," he said.

In the past 3 months, 9 cases of polio have been registered so far: 3 polio cases in Uruzgan, 2 in Kandahar, 3 Helmand and 1 in Kunar.

[The statement "[The family] of the polio-affected kid lives on the outskirts of Terinkot city and they (family) did not have access to health facilities" should be coupled with the following sentence "Meanwhile, provincial healthcare officials said the anti-polio vaccine was not launched in Mehrab Abad village due to security conditions; thus, a number of children have not received the polio immunization," which strongly suggests that this child lives in an area with significant civil unrest where access to healthcare, both curative and preventive, is significantly limited. What needs to be emphasized is that while there isn't access to normal healthcare services and vaccinators are often unable to access these areas, the poliovirus is able to access these areas and circulate in the pockets of susceptible individuals living there. Until something can be done to convince the warring parties that children's health should not be held hostage for political gain, the goal of polio eradication will also remain hostage to the politics.

A Xinhua.net article on this case mentions that the age of the child is 2.5 years (http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-06/19/c_138155928.htm).

Oruzgan is located in the central part of Afghanistan, sharing southern and southwestern borders with Kandahar and Helmand provinces where other polio cases have been reported this year (2019) as well (https://www.afghana.com/GetLocal/Afghanistan/Provinces.htm).

With the addition of this newly confirmed case, there have now been 9 cases of confirmed poliomyelitis reported from Afghanistan since the beginning of 2019. Add these to the 24 cases confirmed in Pakistan, and there are now 33 cases reported this year (2019) -- the same number as reported for the entire year of 2018. - Mod.MPP
