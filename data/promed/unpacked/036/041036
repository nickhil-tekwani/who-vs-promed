South African health officials report a 2nd Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) case in the country this year [2022] in a 32-year-old man from Burgersdorp, Eastern Cape Province. The first was a fatal case of CCHF reported from the Western Cape Province.

Prior to falling ill, the patient was working in different areas in the Eastern Cape and Free State provinces. A tick bite was identified as the source of infection. It is noted that the patient is involved with culling operations on farms and reserves, so exposure to the virus through contact with raw meat or blood of infected wildlife is also a possibility.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was confirmed on 10 Sep 2022. The patient was hospitalized in Free State province.

During his hospitalization, bleeding gums, bone marrow venipuncture hemorrhage, severe thrombocytopenia and hematoma were recorded. The patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) of the Bunyaviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

CCHF is a rare human disease in South Africa with 220 cases reported from 1981 (when CCHF was 1st recorded in South Africa).

[CCHF was 1st reported in South Africa in 1981 (1). CCHF is being reported with increasing frequency from South Africa. In 1985, an outbreak was reported from a Cape Town hospital due to nosocomial spread of virus (2). Nosocomial infections with CCHF have occurred in other countries, including Iraq, the former Soviet Union, and Pakistan (3,4). Contact with bloody secretions appeared to be the means of transmission in those outbreaks, although airborne transmission has been neither proven nor disproven (4).

CCHF is caused by a bunyavirus of the arbovirus group. Widespread occurrence of the antibodies in wild and domestic animals in South Africa has been documented (5). Transmission to humans is thought to be primarily via the _Hyalomma_ genus of tick or contact with the blood of infected animals (5).

CCHF, as well as other viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as Ebola virus disease, Marburg virus disease, and Lassa fever, have the potential to spread in a hospital setting. Patients are often hospitalized with a severe illness, but the nonspecific nature of their signs and symptoms may not suggest a viral hemorrhagic fever.

Even simple isolation procedures, such as barrier nursing on open wards, can effectively halt transmission of these viruses. Therefore, it is imperative that a diagnosis of a viral hemorrhagic fever be considered in any patient with an unknown febrile disease who either resides in or traveled to an endemic area within 3 weeks of the onset of symptoms. If other more common causes of the fever, such as malaria or sepsis, can be reasonably excluded, measures for isolation of the patient should be taken immediately. - Mod.UBA

An outbreak of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever has been confirmed in Amuru district. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever usually transmitted by ticks.

Health officials revealed on Thursday [29 Sep 2022] that samples taken from an 18-year-old man who succumbed over the weekend tested positive for the viral disease. He had reportedly presented with symptoms similar to the Ebola Virus Disease.

The victim, a resident of Lulai village in Opara sub-county was confirmed dead on arrival on Saturday [24 Sep 2022] at Lacor health center III in Pabbo town council, where he had been rushed by his family for treatment.

Amuru Resident District Commissioner Osorn Oceng told Uganda Radio Network in an interview that blood samples taken from the victim had been referred for a test at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI).

He says on Wednesday [28 Sep 2022], they received notification from UVRI through Gulu Regional Referral Hospital that the victim's blood sample tested positive for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever.

Latek says they have activated contact tracing and notified the family of the deceased and health workers who attempted to treat him to reach out to medical workers in case they start experiencing symptoms similar to the disease.

He however called on locals in the district not to panic and asked them to be vigilant about any strange symptoms similar to hemorrhagic fever.

Latek suspects unregulated movement of animals infected with the viral disease could have caused the outbreak in the district.

Stephen Milton Okello, a senior clinical officer, and the acting Amuru district surveillance focal point person says they will convene a task force meeting to plan on how to contain the spread of the disease. He says a team has already been briefed and will be dispatched to the home of the deceased to further conduct an assessment on contacts.

Okello however says the district lacks resources at the moment which may likely affect the movement of personnel to the affected area for sample collection and contact tracing.

Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the Health Ministry Senior Public Relations officer told Uganda Radio Network Thursday morning [29 Sep 2022] that he hadn't yet received notification on the outbreak. He was however quick to assert that the disease isn't that serious and only endemic in the cattle corridors.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the disease is primarily transmitted to people from ticks and livestock animals.

Human-to-human transmission can also occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons and has a case fatality rate of 40% according to CDC.

Uganda had not reported outbreaks of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in humans until 2013 when human cases of CCHF were detected in the Northern Uganda district of Agago.

[CCHF has occurred sporadically in Uganda over recent years and is endemic there. The virus causes a viral hemorrhagic fever, and the virus is transmitted by ticks.

Uganda lies between countries that have frequent outbreaks of RVF (Rift Valley fever) and in which CCHF is endemic: Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, and Sudan. A recent Food and Agriculture Organization risk analysis identified Uganda as at very high risk of amplification in some districts of the cattle corridor, which covers 52 districts cutting across the central part of the country from the southwest in Ankole-Kigezi to the northeastern region in Karamoja. The RVF virus has been isolated frequently in domestic animals in all affected areas. In addition, the practice of eating "sanga meat" (meat harvested from sick animals) in some districts heightens the risk of zoonotic transmission of both VHFs (viral hemorrhagic fevers, CCHF and Rift Valley fever). At present, there is inadequate community engagement and social mobilization around the risks posed by these practices. Most of the 52 districts in the cattle corridor lack such engagement (http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/273497/OEW30-2127072018.pdf).

CCHF can cause serious disease in humans, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. WHO states that the onset of symptoms in humans is sudden, with fever, myalgia (muscle ache), dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2-4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with detectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement). Other clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and on the skin.

Public education, especially among individuals in contact with livestock or their products, is needed to prevent cases of CCHF infection. A One Health approach is needed for effective surveillance, with effective communication between animal health and human health professionals. - Mod.UBA
