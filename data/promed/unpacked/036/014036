Cases of leishmaniasis have reached an alarming level in Landi Kotal subdivision of Khyber tribal area amid conflicting claims by health officials, with the medical superintendent of the hospital complaining about an acute shortage of necessary medicines and the agency surgeon claiming to have treated a maximum number of the affected patients.

Doctors at the main Landi Kotal hospital told this correspondent that they had been receiving 40 to 50 patients daily, mostly children, with bites on their faces and other open parts of the body by the sand fly, which transmits common cutaneous leishmaniasis. "Over 8000 people were affected with cutaneous leishmaniasis during last 3-4 years, with children below 5 the prime target of the sand fly," medical superintendent Dr Khalid Javed told Dawn while examining 2 such patients in his office. Doctors say they have been receiving 40 to 50 patients daily at the hospital.

Dr Javed said that despite the rising number of such cases, the health department provided them with only 60 glucotine injections, which were administered to leishmania-affected patients. He said that the Directorate of Health Services, FATA, had supplied them with a thermotherapy machine, which was proving effective in curing the scars caused by the vector sand fly.

In view of the rising number of leishmania cases in tribal regions, the health directorate placed an order for 22 000 glucotine injections to be imported from abroad as the medicine was not manufactured locally, sources said.

Senator Taj Mohammad also provided 500 glucotine [Glucantime SB] injections to Landi Kotal hospital after he was approached by the doctors for help, while army authorities provided at least 800 such injections to the directorate of health services, of which 600 were distributed in Bara, Jamrud and Landi Kotal.

Dr Javed said that the cure rate with the use of thermotherapy was about 70 to 80 per cent. He said that the scar caused by the bite healed in a year or 2 and that there was no danger of death from it. He said that now the health authorities were focusing on the prevention of cutaneous leishmaniasis, with health teams being sent for fogging and smoke spraying as well as sensitising the residents about the use of mosquito repellents.

Agency surgeon Dr Shafeeq, however, gave an optimistic picture by saying that the disease was now almost under control, with most of the over 8000 patients either treated or under treatment. He said that besides treatment, they also provided mosquito nets to the needy local residents.

[Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Pakistan, especially in the North West tribal areas. The latest data available from WHO (http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/resources/Pakistan_CP_2014.pdf) indicate a rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) of around 0.2 per 10 000 population. However, looking at the maps of the regional incidence, data are lacking from many of the North West Frontier areas, and thus CL is probably much underreported.

As pointed out in the ProMED-mail posting 20170408.4958084 from 8 Apr 2017, there is no government leishmania control program in Pakistan and no program to identify the animal reservoirs and reduce transmission. Thus, these areas, like Afghanistan, remain highly endemic. - Mod.EP
