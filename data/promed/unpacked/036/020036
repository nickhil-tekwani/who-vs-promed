Spot blotch: a new wheat disease
--------------------------------
Farmers in Sindh found that the yield was contrary to their [high]
expectations. A large number of growers from Punjab are also reported
to have disease [in their crops]. Some areas have been badly affected
with significant losses in yield, while other areas are less affected.

Losses depend on various factors such as early start of disease, late
planting, varieties sown, temperature and humidity, etc. Most of the
crops planted late have been affected seriously. The losses due to
this problem have been estimated at about 2 million tons, or between
8-10 percent.

The author travelled to various farms in Sindh and Punjab in March
and early April [2009]. The symptoms included black irregular spots
on leaves. The affected leaves looked as if they were dried and
devoid of chlorophyll. Powder of leaf rust was not observed in the
wheat fields. Powdery mildew was also not serious in the affected
areas.

Samples of leaves from different districts were sent to the National
Agricultural Research Centre, Islamabad. The disease was identified
as "_Bipolaris sorokiniana_" spot blotch, also known as
helminthosporium leaf blight (HLB). It mostly occurs in India,
Bangladesh, and Nepal. In Pakistan, it was observed on a small scale
in the past. It re-appeared here during 2008/2009. HLB is a seed,
soil and air borne disease. The current occurrence seems to be
air-borne with origin of spread presumably being coastal areas of
India and Bangladesh.

It is not possible to eliminate the most susceptible wheat variety
"Bhakkar-02" which is covering about 50 percent of the area in
southern Punjab and Sindh. Spot blotch can be controlled in the most
effective and cheapest way by the introduction of resistant wheat
varieties. During the visit it was observed that 4 wheat varieties,
that is, TJ-83 and TD-01 from Sindh, and Serhar-06 and Fareed-06 from
Punjab had the ability to resist this disease. Seed treatment should
be applied strictly for its control in future.

[Spot blotch of wheat and barley is caused by different strains of
the fungus _Cochliobolus sativus_ (synonym _Bipolaris sorokiniana_).
The pathogen is also associated with root rot, seedling and head
blights, and black point of kernels. It causes significant yield
losses in both crops and has been recognised as the major disease
constraint to wheat cultivation in the warmer eastern plains of South
Asia. Infection early during the cropping cycle leads to more serious
losses, and plants subject to other stress factors are more
susceptible. Outbreaks are favoured by warm temperatures and high
relative humidity.

The fungus survives on crop debris, and several grass species may
serve as reservoir hosts. Spread occurs with infected seeds, soil or
other material, and by wind. For disease management an integrated
approach is recommended including crop rotation, cultural practices,
removal of pathogen reservoirs, fungicide treatments of seed and
crops, and use of resistant crop varieties.

In the story above, India and Bangladesh are suggested as likely
sources of the emergence of spot blotch in Pakistan. However, since
no facts are presented it cannot be excluded that the current
outbreak may have originated from other areas or even from infected
seed.
