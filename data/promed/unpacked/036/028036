Echoviruses 13 & 30 in Relation to Aseptic Meningitis in Western Australia
-------------------------------------------
I note with interest the posting on the recent increase in prevalence of
echovirus 13 in the USA [see: Meningitis, echovirus 13 - USA
20010914.2219. Similarly to the USA, echovirus 13 had been a rare sporadic
enterovirus isolate in Australia prior to 2001, when we began to identify
it in a high proportion of healthy preschool-aged children and in children
admitted to hospital with aseptic meningitis in Western Australia.
We have identified echovirus 13 in a large proportion of healthy children
participating in a community enterovirus surveillance project undertaken
between March and July 2001 in Western Australia and in a small proportion
of cases of aseptic meningitis admitted to our hospital over the same time
period. Of 150 healthy children enrolled in the surveillance project, 15
(10%) yielded an enterovirus isolate from a throat swab. Echovirus 13 was
the commonest isolate (7 isolates; 46%) identified in the healthy children.
A large seasonal outbreak of aseptic meningitis occurred concurrently with
the surveillance project, with approximately 60 children meeting the case
definition of aseptic meningitis admitted to our hospital. Echovirus 30 was
the predominant serotype isolated from the CSF or throat swabs (12 of 21
isolates; 57%) of cases of aseptic meningitis, although 4 cases (19%) were
identified as due to echovirus 13. Neither echovirus 30 nor echovirus 13
had been identified from cases of aseptic meningitis in Western Australia
in the 4 years preceding the 2001 season.

[These data from Peter McMinn complement those obtained in Europe and the
USA. ProMED-mail would welcome reports from elsewhere in the world
regarding the prevalence of echoviruses 13 and 30 in relation to aseptic
meningitis at the present time. - Mod.CP
