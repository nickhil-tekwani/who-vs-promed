WHAT'S KILLING AMERICAN EAGLES? (5)
===================================

Subject: Re[2]: What's killing American eagles?
At long last, attached is a summary of the Wisconsin and Arkansas eagle
mortality events. Although the dieoffs occurred at roughly the same time
of year, we don't feel that they are linked in any way. The clinical
signs and histopathology lesions are very different between the 2 events.
Both dieoff sites are currently being monitored and will be throughout
the winter. To date, no unusual morbidity or mortality has been observed
at either site.
Best wishes,

ARKANSAS EAGLE MORTALITY EVENT, FINAL SUMMARY REPORT, January 23, 1996
Background
Bald eagle mortality was first detected at De Gray Lake in southwestern
Arkansas, on November 24, 1994. Between November 24 and December 28, 1994,
23 sick and dead eagles were picked up on the 14,000 acre lake. One
additional sick eagle was collected on January 15, 1995 and five decomposed
carcasses were found from January through March, bringing the total
mortality to 29 eagles. Sick birds were reported to have seizures, tremors
and difficulty flying and landing. Three sick eagles taken into
rehabilitation subsequently died. Analysis of blood from one of the sick
birds revealed it was dehydrated and had low total protein levels. The Army
Corp of Engineers, Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, Arkansas State Parks,
USFWS Law Enforcement and numerous volunteers intensively monitored the lake
and surrounding areas for sick and dead eagles. A National Wildlife Health
Center (NWHC- Department of Interior) Wildlife Disease Specialist conducted
a field investigation at the site, attended a meeting with all involved
parties and toured areas where eagles had been found.
Fifteen eagles were observed at the lake during the winter eagle count on
January 12, 1995, including 1 semi-resident pair. Approximately 1,000
eagles winter in Arkansas. According to historical band return information,
most of those birds are migrants from Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Canada.
Diagnostic Activities

The cause of mortality is still unknown. Numerous common and uncommon
causes of death in eagles and other birds have been ruled out. Diagnostic
evaluation included gross and microscopic examination of tissues,
parasitology, virology, bacteriology, and extensive toxicologic testing.
The carcasses were in good body condition, had empty intestinal tracts and
had no evidence of bacterial, viral or parasitic disease. Histopathologic
examination of the central nervous system revealed status spongiosis of the
white matter. The lesion had not previously been seen in eagles examined at
the NWHC. Status spongiosis has been associated with toxic compounds in
mammals. Analysis for likely compounds was negative. Tissues were saved
frozen from several birds to be used in the future if new information
becomes available. Several laboratories, toxicologists and animal disease
specialists provided assistance in this challenging case. Presentations
were made at 2 national meetings of avian pathologists to solicit comment.
Alphabetical list of etiologies which have been ruled out.
Acute Organophosphate and Carbamate Compound Toxicity
Algal Poisoning (Microcystin and Neo-saxitoxin)
Arsenic
Barbiturates
Cyanide
Heavy Metals; Cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, mercury,
molybdenum, nickel, zinc, manganese, and selenium.
Infectious Diseases (Bacterial, Viral, Parasitic)
OPIDN (Organophosphate Induced Delayed Neurotoxicity)
Organochlorines Aldrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD,
p,p'-DDE,o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor,
heptachlor epoxide, lindane, nonachlor, PCB's.
Organolead
Rodenticides, anticoagulants
Rodenticides, Bromethalin
Salicylanilides
Sodium fluoroacetate (1080)
Strychnine
Thallium
Tin- Organic and Inorganic
T-61 (Euthanasia solution)
Results of Mixed Function Oxidases (EROD) and HPLC-MS diagnostic
techniques were inconclusive.

WISCONSIN EAGLE MORTALITY EVENT, FINAL SUMMARY REPORT, January 25, 1996
Background
During the late winter of 1995, 11 bald eagles (4 dead and 7 sick) were
collected within foraging distance from 4 roost areas on the Wisconsin River
in Sauk and Columbia Counties, Wisconsin. The eagles were in good physical
condition and represented all ages and both sexes. Of seven eagles found
alive, one died soon after collection and four died in rehabilitation. The
sick eagles had muscle tremors and convulsions and some birds vomited. Two
eagles were observed and treated at the NBS National Wildlife Health Center
(NWHC) in Madison, Wisconsin; transferred to a wildlife rehabilitator in
March; and released to the wild in April 1995. Blood work on these two
recovering eagles indicated mild leukocytosis with heterophilia and atypical
lymphocytes. Ultrasound and biopsies of the livers indicated damage to
liver cells. All blood tests were repeated until within normal ranges and
prior to release of the eagles, all test results were evaluated to assess
any potential risks to the wild population.
The nine dead eagles were necropsied at the NWHC. There was evidence at
collection sites that some eagles had vomited and had convulsions prior to
death. There were no gross external or internal changes present that were
associated with infectious disease. Microscopic examination of tissues
indicated changes in liver cells and blood vessels of the brain that were
most consistent with toxic and/or metabolic insults. Rarely, some of the
changes seen are associated with infectious disease.
Extensive field investigations were conducted of areas used by eagles for
feeding and roosting by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources
(WIDNR) with help of local eagle watchers. All sick or dead eagles found
throughout the state and wildlife species found in the mortality area were
collected and examined during this time period. No other species were
affected.
The cause of this mortality event is still unknown. The common causes of
death in bald eagles and other birds have been ruled out as well as many
infectious and toxic agents that would be considered unusual in eagles.
Consultations were obtained from ten animal disease specialists and tissues
were sent to eight additional diagnostic laboratories for evaluation. This
case was presented at two national meetings of avian pathologists to solicit
comment.
A number of tissues were saved frozen from each of the nine birds examined
by necropsy to be used in the future if new information becomes available.
Alphabetical list of etiologies which have been ruled out.
Acute Organophosphate and Carbamate Compound Toxicity
Algal Poisoning
Avitrol (4-aminopyridine)
Cyanide
Heavy Metals: Arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead,
molybdenum, nickel, zinc, tin, manganese, mercury, and
selenium.
Infectious Diseases (Bacterial, Viral, Parasitic)
Organochlorines: Aldrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD,
p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor,
heptachlor epoxide, lindane, nonachlor, and PCB's.
Strychnine
Sodium fluoroacetate (1080)
White phosphorus (P4)
Results from HPLC-MS testing were inconclusive. Attempts to assay
cytochrome P450 enzyme activity were unsuccessful.
Immunohistochemistry on brain samples were negative for
Haemophilus somnus, rabies virus, influenza A virus, canine
distemper virus and for the protozoan parasites Toxoplasma sp.,
Neospora sp., and Sarcocystis sp.
