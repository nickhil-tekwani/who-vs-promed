Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Republic of Guinea 2021: hypotheses of origin.

Case description and hypothesis

The 1st known case is a female healthcare professional who initially contacted Gueke Medical Center on 18 Jan 2021 complaining about headache, physical weakness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever, where she was mistakenly diagnosed with "typhoid" and then "malaria." On 24 Jan 2021, against the background of a worsening condition, the patient turned to a traditional healer in N'Zerekore. On 28 Jan 2021, she died and was buried on 1 Feb 2021 without observing biological safety measures, which led to infection of the traditional healer and the relatives of hers [1]. The 1st laboratory confirmed cases of the disease among contact persons date back to 12 and 13 Feb 2021. After that, laboratory confirmed cases were reported almost daily from 19--27 Feb 2021. The last laboratory confirmed case was registered on 2 Apr 2021. All of those cases were confined to N'zerekore Prefecture.

It should be noted that the clinical misdiagnosis at the 1st stage of the outbreak, the involvement of traditional healers and medical workers, as well as the pivotal role of unsafe burial rites, is the typical combination of signs of EVD epidemic process characteristic of West Africa, where the unprecedented epidemic was recorded in 2013-2016, which struck Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (over 28 000 cases, 11 000 deaths), as well as, to a small extent, the countries of Europe and the United States [2].

To date, the cause of this epidemic outbreak remains unknown [among several hypotheses]:
1) Import from the Central African region, where EVD cases have been reported in the DR Congo for quite a long time.
2) Latent chain of transmission of EVD among the population of the N'Zerekore region (Republic of Guinea).
3) Circulation of the EVD pathogen in an environment with subsequent passage into the human population.
4) Transmission of the virus from survivors.

We examined a sample of the EVD agent genome isolated from a clinical specimen (laboratory ID E2) obtained from a patient who had contact with the 1st case of EVD living in the N'Zerekore prefecture.

Discussion
The main working hypothesis is currently considered the long-term persistence of the virus in certain areas and organs of the body that are not susceptible to antibodies, including the spinal cord, brain, eyeballs, placenta, mammary glands, and testicles after infection and clinical recovery [5, 6, 7]. Indeed, after the EVD epidemic of 2013-2016, it was shown that a viable virus can remain and be secreted for long periods, in particular, with semen in survivors up to one and a half years onward [8, 9, 10]. Sexual transmission of the virus from late relapses was confirmed as the main cause of epidemiological distress in Liberia in 2015-2016 [11, 12]. Similar cases were also noted in the Republic of Guinea [13, 14]. Another typical example of the possible epidemiological significance of survivors is the case of the nurse, Pauline Cafferkey, who was infected with the Ebola virus while working at a treatment center in Sierra Leone in 2014, later evacuated and treated in the UK and was discharged with recovery [15]. It was shown that the virus remained in her cerebrospinal fluid and led to a relapse after 10 months [16]. It is of fundamental importance that the genome of the original agent and the genome isolated after 10 months from the same patient differ by only 2 single substitutions, while in the case of relay transmission from person to person, about 20 polymorphisms would be accumulated [17]. Similar frequency of SNPs occurrence in the genome of a persistent virus in the body were demonstrated in the case of EVD recurrence in DR Congo, where the period between the disease and relapse was 5 months [18]. In other words, the frequency of SNPs occurrence in genome under the conditions of a survivor organism is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to that with epidemic transmission and amounts to 1-2x10-4 substitutions per site per year.

Conclusion
Thus, when evaluating the hypotheses of the origin of the EVD outbreak in Guinea in 2021, the most probable should be considered infection from one of the survivors who recovered from EVD in 2014-2015.

The long period of persistence of the virus in the body of survivors and the possibility of a relapse of the disease confirms the relevance and practical significance of monitoring programs for survivors in the countries most affected by EVD outbreaks. Effective monitoring of survivors at the national level will reduce the risks of large-scale EVD outbreaks, which will significantly increase the epidemical safety of foreign countries in terms of probable importation and spread of the disease along the most loaded passenger traffic flows.

Since 13 Apr 2021, no new cases or deaths from Ebola virus disease have been reported in Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo. Cumulatively, there have been 35 cases of Ebola virus disease, including 18 deaths (CFR: 51%), and 15 recoveries from the Democratic Republic of Congo (12 cases; 6 deaths; 6 recoveries) and Guinea (23; 12; 9). These include 2 health workers from the Democratic Republic of Congo and 5 health workers from Guinea. [See Table 1 for the subnational details.]

- Updates from the Democratic Republic of Congo: The last confirmed case was reported 50 days ago. The outbreak will be declared over if there are no new cases reported over the next 13 days.

- Updates from Guinea: The last confirmed case and death reported was reported 17 days ago.

- Africa CDC continues its weekly press briefing on the Ebola virus disease situation in Guinea and Democratic Republic of Congo to provide updated information.

- Africa CDC continues its rumor monitoring through media scanning to ensure prompt response to mis- and disinformation on Ebola virus disease in Africa.

Recommendations for the Member States:
1. Member States should continue to enhance their cross-border surveillance efforts to:
a. Map population movements and identify all potential crossing points where there is risk of disease spread.
b. Conduct screenings for travelers with fever, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and hemorrhage at the borders.
c. Implement temperature monitoring, infection prevention and control measures and other public health measures at the borders.
d. Share EVD related information along with COVID-19 and other infection control information at borders.

2. Member States should continue to perform contact tracing and follow up of all probable and confirmed cases.

3. Member States should scale up infection prevention and control measures in health care settings.

4. All Member States should notify and routinely share data about confirmed EVD cases, deaths, recoveries, tests conducted, and healthcare workers infected with WHO and Africa CDC. Notify Africa CDC by emailing: <AfricaCDCEBS@africa-union.org>.

5. Member States should continue to provide information to the general public about how and where to seek immediate medical care for EVD when they develop symptoms.

6. Member States should work urgently with partners to improve their preparedness for detecting and managing imported cases, including the mapping of health facilities and active surveillance with zero reporting.

7. At-risk countries should put in place approvals for investigational medicines and vaccines as an immediate priority preparedness action plan.

[3] Nigeria: alert
Date: Sat Apr 2021

The federal ministry of health has written its heads of departments and programmes over a recent resurgence of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Guinea Conakry, capital city of Guinea.

In a memo dated 19 Apr 2021, the ministry said it was informed of the outbreak via a letter from the ministry of foreign affairs.

It said the Liberian government has also called the attention of Nigerian authorities to the outbreak, asking the country to take necessary measures to curb the spread of the disease.

"The ministry is in receipt of a letter from the ministry of foreign affairs informing Nigeria of the recent outbreak and resurgence of the deadly Ebola virus in Guinea Conakry, which has devastated the country in the past," the memo read.

"In view of the above, the Liberian government has requested the Nigerian authorities to take necessary measures to avoid further spread of the deadly virus.

"While the relevant technical departments or agencies are working on the national response and instituting appropriate measures, you are to also be mindful of this outbreak and its implication to the West Africa sub-region and be guided accordingly. Please treat as important."

The development comes 2 months after the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) placed Nigeria at moderate risk of experiencing an Ebola outbreak.

But according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, there has been no new case of Ebola for over a week in Guinea.

The NCDC had said it placed Nigeria at moderate risk owing to its proximity to Guinea after an EVD outbreak was declared in the West African country on 14 Feb 2021.

In 2014, there was an outbreak of Ebola across West Africa, including in Nigeria.

[It is not clear why this alert was issued on 19 Apr 2021 when the last few cases were reported on 7 Apr 2021. To the best of my knowledge, no additional cases have been reported since then. Regardless, it is important that countries in which Ebola is endemic/enzootic, or those countries neighboring such countries, remain on the alert, maintain health infrastructure, and regularly conduct intensive surveillance.

Countries at risk of Ebola outbreaks must be prepared in advance to respond quickly.

"There are a series of key basic things that have to be done rapidly and well [at the start of an Ebola response]:
- contact tracing (identifying all people who have been in contact with someone who has Ebola, in order to be able to monitor their health and stop that chain of transmission);
- having medical facilities with the right set-up for isolating and treating Ebola patients;
- ensuring there are safe funeral practices for anyone who dies of Ebola or suspected Ebola;
- passing good, clear, health education information;
- making sure there is a good triage set-up in all health facilities to minimise the chances of Ebola having knock-on consequences on the rest of the health system; and
- above all else, community engagement.

Community engagement is particularly vital. You need to invest time and energy in talking -- and listening -- to the communities in affected areas. You need to adapt the response according to what they say, and you need them to adapt to the risks of Ebola. It has to be a 2-way conversation" (excerpted from https://www.msf.org/five-questions-2021-ebola-outbreak-guinea). - Mod.LK
