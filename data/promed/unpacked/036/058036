The Health Secretariat of Varre-Sai, in the Norte Fluminense area of the state of Rio de Janeiro, awaits the analysis of samples from 3 people who died with suspicion of "febre maculosa" [Rocky Mountain spotted fever - Mod.LL], a disease transmitted by ticks. The 3 died in the last week, after having gone fishing in Rio Carangola, in the neighboring municipality of Natividade, an area where there are many capybara [large aquatic rodents], one of the main hosts of the tick.

[The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia, _Rickettsia rickettsii_, is the cause of this illness, which is also referred to as febre maculosa, Sao Paulo exanthematic typhus, Minas Gerais exanthematic typhus, and Brazilian spotted fever. The organism, which is tickborne, is distributed through much of the USA, including the Rocky Mountains and also in parts of southern Canada, Central, and South America.

It cannot be stressed enough that early recognition of this disease is quite important in minimizing morbidity and mortality. This is especially true in areas where the infection is not as classically known. The incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, with fever, muscle pains, and headache (the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins in day 3 of illness, initially maculopapular (an area that is red and has small, confluent bumps) at the wrists and ankles, before becoming petechial (red or purple spots caused by minor hemorrhage) and purpuric (purple spots) involving the palms and soles, as well as spreading proximally to the trunck. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be started in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The capybara is a large rodent; its size can be appreciated by this picture next to a cat: http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130802192230/whatever-you-want/images/2/2a/O-CAPYBARA-HUGS-CAT-facebook.jpg.
