Cyprus began slaughtering about 1500 sheep after confirmed
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in 2 more farms.

Fotis Fotiou said the EU-accredited lab in Pirbright, England
confirmed the new outbreaks of the highly contagious virus Tuesday
[13 Nov 2007; "new" is probably an inaccurate term; there is no clue
of a spreading disease but rather of additional serological tests;
see in commentary on Cyprus the follow-up report to the OIE, dated 13
Nov 2007. - Mod.AS].

Authorities planned to destroy 1500 animals from one farm in the
livestock breeding area of Dromolaxia and slaughter another 70 from
another farm on Thursday [15 Nov 2007].

"(Farmers) must understand that whatever measures are taken, even
slaughtering animals, they are taken to prevent the worst," Fotiou
said.

Some 560 goats, sheep and pigs have already been slaughtered in the
Dromolaxia area since tests from the Pirbright lab confirmed the
infection at 4 farms on 5 Nov 2007.

EU food safety experts have imposed a ban on livestock, meat and
dairy exports from Cyprus because of the outbreak but made an
exception for the island's famed halloumi cheese [a commendable
delicacy! - Mod.AS].

Cyprus is not a major meat exporter, but halloumi cheese is one of
the country's key farm exports, along with potatoes and citrus fruits.

There is no selective culling; if animals are found to have FMD in a
farm, then all the livestock must go, a senior Veterinary Service
official clarified yesterday [13 Nov 2007].

Pavlos Toumazos cleared up the confusion over the fate of 3500
animals by stating clearly there was no way you could pick and choose
which animals would be culled or not once FMD was found.

The animals belong to 2 farms in the 3-km exclusion zone in
Dromolaxia, with the owners awaiting results of tests undertaken at
the Vet Services Laboratory.

Agriculture Minister Fotis Fotiou had hinted earlier that a wholesale
culling was not a certainty, even if some of the samples came back
positive for FMD. The minister had suggested that subsequent culling
depended on the number of cases and the scale of the disease.

"You cannot have selective culling," clarified Toumazos. "The
specific case where we took certain samples from animals was for
further examinations. We didn't choose to kill 3 animals with the aim
of separating the infected ones and leaving the rest in the farm," he
added.

Asked whether all the animals would be culled if the tests came back
positive, the official replied: "Definitely."

Toumazos noted that initial tests had come back positive from the 2
farms in Dromolaxia. He also highlighted that, so far, the test
results from the laboratory in London matched those of the Vet
Services Lab.

Regarding the rumours and theories floating around regarding the
existence of FMD on the island, he said: "They should let us do our
work and get our results instead of everybody talking and giving
views on where and why, so we can limit the situation to the 3-km
exclusion zone. And as we can see, the results we're getting don't
show the virus anywhere outside of this zone, so we can save
livestock farming."

The Veterinary Services have tightened measures to clamp down on the
potential spread of FMD in Cyprus.

According to yesterday's [13 Nov 2007] announcement, the import and
export of live animals susceptible to the disease (pigs, sheep, goats
and cattle) has been banned. The transportation of animals from one
farm to another throughout Cyprus has been prohibited as well as from
farms to market places for trade. No animals from within the 3-km
exclusion zone may be taken for slaughter. An exception to the rule
is pigs within the zone which, once checked and approved, can be
taken to Kofinou or CYPRA slaughterhouse along with a Vet Services
permit. However, the pigs cannot be put in contact with other animals
from outside the zone brought to the slaughterhouse and must be kept
separate at all times. Slaughter of pigs within the zone can only
take place on certain days, while once slaughtered they must be kept
in separate freezers for a 48-hour period.

Animals outside the zone can be taken for slaughter as long as they
go directly from the farms to the slaughterhouse.

Following the confirmation of the presence of FMD in animals in
southern Cyprus, Turkish Cypriot Minister of Agriculture Onder
Sennaroglu issued a statement asking citizens to be sensitive about
the precautions that were being taken.

In his statement, Sennaroglu said that a crisis desk had been set up
at the Turkish Cypriot Prime Ministry in order to monitor the effects
of the viral disease discovered on a sheep farm in southern Cyprus.
He stated that 2 professionals from Turkey had been invited to
northern Cyprus to research the issue and reiterated that the disease
had not yet been seen here. The Minister said that the quarantine
area around the infected farm in southern Cyprus had been increased
to 10 km by the Greek Cypriot administration and that the closest
Turkish village is at least 8-10 km distant from the quarantined
area. [See a map of Cyprus showing its division, by a UN buffer zone,
into a Cyprus Government area (Greek Cypriot area) and a northern,
Turkish Cypriot-administered area at
<http://www.mlahanas.de/Cyprus/Image/CyprusMap.png>.
The alleged outbreak, in Dromolaxia, is about 5 km southwest of
Larnaca. - Mod.AS].

Sennaroglu called on all citizens to be sensitive to the prophylactic
measures being taken at south-north crossing points and the ban on
the importation of any number of animals or amount animal products
from southern Cyprus and said: "We ask our citizens to be sensitive
about this issue. The FMD found in cloven hoofed animals is viral and
can pass from one animal to another quite easily."

[This is a complex and confusing situation.

The Cypriot authorities have to abide by EU requirements regarding
FMD, and since it seems that the EU experts have decided that
positive serological tests are indicative of infection and sufficient
for declaring an outbreak, culling has been prescribed.

Cyprus' follow-up report No 1, sent on 13 Nov 2007 to the OIE,
addressed the farm "Dromolaxia 2, Larnaca," specifying that the
outbreak started on 2 Nov 2007 and resolved on 6 Nov 2007; indeed, an
unusually short-lived FMD outbreak. The laboratory results are clear,
and their reliability is not contested: positive 3ABC tests (Cyprus
National lab); positive neutralisation tests (Pirbright); negative
PCR's (Pirbright).

The report further says that: "Lesions were found in the mouth of
lambs in the sheep farm." According to this moderator's experience,
buccal lesions in sheep are not very common, while podal lesions and
subsequent lameness are the rule. Such lesions are not mentioned in
the report. For the full report, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6470>.

From a reliable source in Cyprus, we have obtained the following
additional data:
1. All animals tested were adults.
2. No clinical symptoms of FMD were observed in all cattle and pig
farms in the Protected zone of 3 km or in the Surveillance zone of 10
km.
3. No FMD antibodies were detected in all blood samples from about
1250 cattle and pigs tested in Cyprus and at Pirbright.
4. Cypriot and visiting Greek experts did not report any FMD
symptoms; "very mild symptoms" were suspected by an European EU
expert (probably, these are the lesions referred to in the follow-up
report).
5. No FMD vaccination is officially known to have been applied in
both parts of Cyprus in recent years; however, the possibility that
FMD vaccines have been imported could not be excluded.
6. Clinical and serological evidence for the presence of bluetongue,
in sheep and cattle, have been reported.

The above information is supportive of our earlier observation,
namely that the whole described event may have resulted from the
application of (inactivated) FMD vaccine (See 20071109.3637), which
has given rise to the neutralising antibodies. The positive 3ABC
tests, detecting Non Specific Proteins (NSP), may be indicative of a
past application of (partly or poorly purified) inactivated FMD
vaccines. Whether such vaccines have indeed been injected into the
(adult) tested sheep, and -- in case affirmative -- when and where
this could have happened, deserves a thorough investigation. The view
of Pirbright's experts on the issue would be valuable.

It is also worth a reminder that the 1st examined case, in a sheep,
was initially suspected to be bluetongue. The serological test
performed was found to be negative; this could probably be explained
by sampling carried out before seroconversion. The prescribed test
for a clinically suspected BT case is virus detection, either by its
isolation (preferably by i.v. inoculation into embryonated chicken
eggs) or by PCR.

Official information on tests for bluetongue in Cyprus during 2007
will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
