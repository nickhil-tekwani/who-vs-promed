[Poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, continues to be identified globally. In the past week there is evidence of ongoing transmission of the WPV1 in 2 countries (Pakistan and Mozambique), evidence of transmission of cVDPV1 in 3 countries (DR Congo, Madagascar and Mozambique) and of cVDPV2 in 4 countries (Botswana, CAR, DR Congo, Nigeria). Botswana is a new country identifying cVDPV2 in an environmental sample genetically linked to a cVDPV2 in an AFP case in Lomami DR Congo in May 2022.

Looking at total global case counts, 2022 has more cases of WPV1 associated AFP than identified in all of 2021, and more cases of cVDPV associated AFP to date than in the same period for 2021.

2022 to date continues to be a good year for the viruses but not for eradication efforts.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Pakistan: violence against vaccination efforts
Date: Tue 1 Nov 2022
Source: Eurasia Review/SATP (South Asia Terrorism Portal) [abridged, edited]
https://www.eurasiareview.com/01112022-pakistan-twin-viruses-polio-and-terrorism-analysis/


On 27 Oct 2022, unidentified militants killed a paramilitary Levies officer deployed to provide security to an anti-polio team in the Sarki Talari tehsil (revenue unit) of Chaman District in Balochistan. The militants shot [him] in the head, killing him on the spot. The members of Polio team escaped unhurt.

On 25 Oct 2022, a Policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the Trat area of Pishin District in Balochistan. Pishin Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Yasir said that the assailants attacked the vaccination team, killing the Policeman. The polio team workers remained unhurt in the attack.

On 24 Oct 2022, Pakistan kicked off a 7-day nationwide anti-polio vaccination campaign in an effort to eradicate the crippling disease. The vaccination campaign will be carried out in 28 Districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), 21 Districts of Sindh, 19 Districts of Balochistan and 14 Districts of Punjab.

Whenever a Polio campaign starts in Pakistan, there is violence directed against the vaccination teams. The current Polio programme, the 4th of 2022, had already recorded 2 incidents, with 2 Policemen killed. The 3 previous Polio campaign saw attacks. The 1st campaign between 17-24 Jan 2022 was, by and large, peaceful, with just one incident of killing of a Policeman on 25 Jan 2022. The 2nd campaign -- 27 Jun to 3 Jul 2022 -- claimed 3 lives, including 2 policemen and one polio worker. During the 3rd campaign, 19-29 Aug 2022, 2 Policemen were killed by armed men on 16 Aug 2022 in the Tank District of KP, while escorting a polio team for a survey in the area.

According to partial data compiled by the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), at least 7 Policemen and 2 Polio workers have been killed in such attacks in the current year (data till 30 Oct 2022).

The 1st polio immunisation-linked incident of violence recorded by the SATP database was reported on 20 Jul 2012, when unidentified terrorists shot dead a doctor, associated with the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Polio Prevention Campaign, at Al-Asif Square in Junejo Town, Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh. At least 131 persons (58 health workers and 73 Policemen) have been killed in such violence since then. Another 84 persons (54 health workers and 30 policemen) have been injured in such violence.

In 2012, at least 13 persons (all polio workers) were killed in such attacks. There were 18 (8 polio workers and 10 Security Force (SF) personnel) such fatalities in 2013; 39 (12 polio workers and 27 SF personnel) in 2014; 12 (6 polio workers and 6 SF personnel) in 2015; 13 (5 polio workers and 8 SF personnel) in 2016; none in 2017; 6 (5 polio workers and one SF trooper) in 2018; 8 (4 polio workers and 4 SF personnel) in 2019; 5 (3 polio workers and 2 SF personnel) in 2020; and 8 (all SF personnel) in 2021.

Islamist terrorists violently oppose all forms of inoculation, and their resistance grew after the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reportedly organised a fake vaccination drive by a doctor to track down Al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden, who was killed at Abbottabad, KP. Terrorists and extremists also spread negative propaganda against the vaccination campaigns, including the canard that the vaccination drops were part of a western plot to sterilise Muslims.

The polio vaccination campaign in Pakistan has not only suffered at the hands of terrorists but also due to socio-religious opposition and the issuance of Islamist fatwas (religious edicts). The 1st such Fatwa came from a cleric in the Muzaffargarh District of Punjab on 12 Jun 2012. Declaring the anti-polio campaign "un-Islamic," [the cleric] had warned that a jihad (holy war) would be launched against polio vaccination teams.

Subsequent to [this cleric's] 'divine formulation,' the then 'commander of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)'s erstwhile North Waziristan Agency (NWA) 'chapter,' issued a fatwa on 18 Jun 2012, denouncing vaccinations as an American ploy to sterilise the Muslim community and banned these in NWA until the CIA stopped its drone strikes in the region. Bahadur's declaration was a reflection of the consensus reached by the various terrorist outfits that formed the Shura-e-Mujaheddin (Council of Islamic fighters).

On 31 Jul 2019, TTP warned people against polio vaccination. The one-page message in Urdu seen by people in Miranshah, the headquarters of North Waziristan District, cautioned the public not to allow the administration of polio drops to children or to be ready to 'face dire consequences' for their defiance. There were 2 Polio campaigns immediately after the July [2019] threat, in August 2019 and December 2019. A 3-day campaign was conducted between 26 and 28 Aug 2019, during which no one was killed. However, during the 5-day campaign conducted between 16 and 20 Dec 2019, 2 Policemen deployed for the security of polio teams were killed by unidentified assailants in the Maidan area of Lower Dir city (Lower Dir District) in KP on 18 Dec 2019. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all polio campaigns in the country were suspended thereafter.

After the COVID-19 crisis diminished, as soon as polio campaign was restarted, the attacks by extremists resumed. During the 2-6 Aug 2021 campaign, 3 attacks on Polio workers and their security team were reported in which 2 policemen were killed and another policeman sustained injuries. Similarly, during 10-13 Dec 2021 campaign, 3 incidents of attack were reported in which 2 policemen were killed and another policeman sustained injuries.

The Government, however, claims of having provided 'fool proof security' to the vaccination teams. On 20 Jun 2022, Pakistan National Coordinator for the Polio programme, Brigadier Doctor Shahzad Baig reiterated, "Every team is escorted by security, by law enforcement agencies, either police [or] army. And I want to bring it on notice that, so far, the polio program has lost 50 lives in the line of duty to extremist bombings and shootings". He did not, however, specify the period over which these deaths took place.

People's reluctance to have their children vaccinated due to militant threats has also jeopardised the polio programmes. Quoting Global health security expert Dr. Nadeem Jan, Dawn reported on 24 Oct 2022 that there was no system of across-the-board accountability in the polio programme. He added, "Field workers here have been working and putting their life at stake for less than 3 dollars a day and they are sacked in case of small issues. On the other hand, during the last 2 decades, high-ups of programme never faced any accountability rather they were transferred or promoted from Pakistan to Geneva or some other country."

Polio remains endemic in just 2 countries of the world -- Afghanistan and Pakistan. According to End Polio Program (EPP), an offshoot of the Federal Health Ministry's Pakistan Polio Eradication Program (PPEP), Pakistan has recorded 20 cases of polio in 2022, so far, and all the cases were detected in the Tribal Areas of KP, bordering Afghanistan. However, the re-emergence of Islamist terrorism in the tribal areas of KP, has created apprehensions concerning the security of Polio administering teams. On 12 Aug 2022, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Maulana Abdul Shakoor warned that people of the erstwhile tribal areas would boycott polio vaccination campaigns if the government and security institutions failed to restore peace, adding, "We want to make it clear that if the government and security institutions fail to provide us with peace, the people of [former] FATA won't accept the measures being taken by the government, on top of which is polio vaccinations."

The extremist Islamist ideologies rampant in Pakistan, substantially supported by state institutions, and the creation of terrorist proxies by the state agencies have produced a deeply radicalized environment in the country, and the irrational opposition to the polio eradication campaign is a direct consequence. This is what has kept the polio virus alive in Pakistan, threatening not only the children of the country, but keeping alive the danger of its resurgence in other parts of the world. Unless poliovirus transmission ends in Pakistan and Afghanistan, all countries remain at risk; equally, as long as extremism and terrorism continue to find fertile ground in Pakistan, the world will remain vulnerable.

[3] Statement of the 33rd Polio IHR Emergency Committee
Date: Tue 1 Nov 2022
Source: WHO News Release [abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/01-11-2022-statement-of-the-thirty-third-polio-ihr-emergency-committee


Statement of the 33rd Polio IHR Emergency Committee
---------------------------------------------------
The 33rd meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR) on the international spread of poliovirus was convened by the WHO Director-General on 12 Oct 2022 with committee members and advisers attending via video conference, supported by the WHO Secretariat. The Emergency Committee reviewed the data on wild poliovirus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPV) in the context of global eradication of WPV and cessation of outbreaks of cVDPV2 by end of 2023. Technical updates were received about the situation in the following countries and territories: Afghanistan, Algeria, Malawi, Mozambique, Pakistan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Yemen.

Wild poliovirus
---------------
The committee was concerned that since its last meeting in June 2022, Pakistan has reported 12 WPV1 cases, all from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province in Pakistan. Nine cases were from the district of North Waziristan, 2 from Lakki Marwat and 1 from South Waziristan bringing the total number of cases in 2022 in Pakistan to 20. Furthermore, there have been 31 additional positive environmental samples detected in districts in KP, Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad, bringing the total to 33 (65 isolates detected in 2021). However, no human polio case has been reported outside of southern KP. The committee noted that the key challenges which are driving transmission in southern KP include the complex security situation leading to inadequate campaign quality and missed children, community resistance (e.g. fake finger-marking without vaccination, refusals due to various reasons, vaccination boycotts), lack of female frontline workers, weak health infrastructure and service delivery, and sub-optimal routine immunization. Another challenge faced in the most recent campaign was the impact of widespread flooding.

The committee noted that although the ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Pakistan led to a risk of spillover into Afghanistan, there is no evidence of cross-border transmission to date in 2022. Two cases have been reported to date in 2022, 1 in Paktika province and a 2nd in Kunar province in the East. The polio programme in Afghanistan has gained and sustained access across the country including nearly 3 million children previously inaccessible for almost 4 years. There remain approximately half a million missed children mostly in the southern region, due to the continued implementation of the mosque to mosque campaign modality. There are also clusters of refusals mainly in the South-East and East regions. Pockets of insecurity pose a threat to polio workers noting that 8 vaccinators were killed on 24 Feb 2022 during a campaign.

The committee was very concerned about continued WPV1 transmission in the Tête province of northern Mozambique. Genetic sequencing confirms that all the viruses are related indicating the outbreak is due to international spread through a single importation event. While the quality of the rounds in the multi-country immunization response is improving, coverage has been insufficient to halt transmission. Furthermore, while synchronization of activities has been agreed upon by all countries involved in the response, it has yet to be implemented in practice. Zimbabwe has yet to conduct any immunization response although it shares a border with the outbreak zone in Tête. Surveillance activities have also been insufficiently coordinated across borders, with Mozambican citizens coming to Malawi for medical care for acute flaccid paralysis and being notified in Malawi rather than Mozambique. Surveillance ipn Mozambique relies on case finding during campaigns with a lack of active surveillance between campaigns. Other challenges include multiple emergencies, frontline worker fatigue and and high population movement within the subregion.

The committee noted with concern that several frontline health workers were killed in Afghanistan in February 2022, and commended the dedication of health care workers in all countries who are responding to these outbreaks.

Circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV)
----------------------------------------------
Northern Yemen, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and northern Nigeria continue to account for more than 85% of the global cVDPV2 caseload. There have been 4 new countries reporting cVDPV2 -- Algeria, Israel, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. The viruses detected in the latter 3 countries are genetically linked indicating long-distance international spread through air travel has occurred. In the USA, there has been a single cVDPV2 case whilst in Israel and the United Kingdom positive environmental isolates have been detected. The US case belongs to a community that has a low level of immunization coverage. Local transmission in these IPV-only using countries represents a new risk and the committee noted that this phenomenon should remind all countries that until polio is eradicated, pockets of un- or under-immunized persons pose a risk of polio outbreaks, even in countries that have not reported indigenous transmission for a long time. The virus in Algeria is genetically linked to viruses circulating in Nigeria and is therefore an importation due to international spread. Furthermore, the detection of cVDPV2 in Benin, as has been seen in Ghana, Togo and Côte d'Ivoire appears to have resulted from reinfection caused by new international spread from Nigeria.

Three new countries have reported cVDPV1 -- Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi and Mozambique.

The committee noted that much of the risk for cVDPV outbreaks can be linked to a combination of inaccessibility, insecurity, a high concentration of zero dose children and population displacement. These have been most clearly evidenced in northern Yemen, northern Nigeria, south central Somalia and eastern DRC. Despite the ongoing decline in the number of cases and lineages circulating, the recent episodes of international spread of cVDPV2 indicates the risk remains high.

The committee noted that the roll out of wider use of novel OPV2 continues under EUL. The committee also noted the delays to timely, quality outbreak response with countries delaying response with the immediately available vaccine until novel OPV2 vaccine became available. The committee noted the SAGE recommendation that timely outbreak response is of paramount importance and countries should use immediately available vaccines and avoid any delays that may occur while waiting for supply of novel OPV2 vaccine.

Conclusion
----------
Although encouraged by the reported progress, the Committee unanimously agreed that the risk of international spread of poliovirus remains a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and recommended the extension of Temporary Recommendations for a further 3 months. The Committee recognizes the concerns regarding the lengthy p factors in reaching this conclusion:

Ongoing risk of WPV1 international spread:
Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of WPV1 remains:
• the current outbreak of WPV1 in Pakistan where there have been 20 cases in 2022 with spread outside the source of the outbreak but within Pakistan
• high-risk mobile populations in Pakistan represent a specific risk of international spread to Afghanistan in particular
• the large pool of unvaccinated 'zero dose' children in southern Afghanistan constitutes a major risk of WPV1 re-introduction;
• the importation of WPV1 from Pakistan into Malawi and Mozambique, noting that the exact route the virus took remains unknown;
• sub-optimal immunization coverage achieved during recent campaigns in southeastern Africa, meaning ongoing transmission may be occurring;
• surveillance gaps means that such transmission may be missed;
• pockets of insecurity in the remaining endemic transmission zones.

Ongoing risk of cVDPV2 international spread:
Based on the following factors, the risk of international spread of cVDPV2 appears to remain high:
• the explosive outbreak of cVDPV2 in northern Yemen and ongoing high transmission in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo and northern Nigeria, which have caused international spread to neighbouring countries;
• ongoing cross border spread including into newly infected countries such as Algeria, and re-infection of Benin;
• the long distance spread by air travel of cVDPV2 between Israel, the United Kingdom and the USA;
• the ever-widening gap in population intestinal mucosal immunity in young children since the withdrawal of OPV2 in 2016 and consequently high concentration of zero dose children in certain areas, especially the 4 areas mentioned above (second dot point)
• insecurity in those areas that are the source of polio transmission.

Other factors include
• Weak routine immunization: Many countries have weak immunization systems that can be further impacted by humanitarian emergencies including conflict and protracted complex emergencies poses a growing risk, leaving populations in these fragile states vulnerable to polio outbreaks.
• Lack of access: Inaccessibility continues to be a major risk, particularly in northern Yemen which have sizable populations that have been unreached with polio vaccine for extended periods of more than a year.
