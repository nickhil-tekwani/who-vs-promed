More Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in Singapore
----------------------------------------------
This year [2015] the Singapore Ministry of Health reported that just last week, there were 609 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). One childcare centre at Jurong West alone has seen a total of 16 HFMD cases from 3 to 12 Mar 2015. More children in Singapore have been afflicted with HFMD in the last 11 weeks, compared to same period in 2014.

Latest figures by the Ministry of Health showed that just last week, there were 609 cases, almost twice the number of cases compared to the same period last year [2014].

Two childcare centres -- PCF Sparkletots Boon Lay and Sunflower Preschool Balestier -- have seen more than 10 cases and prolonged transmission. PCF Sparkeltots Boon Lay, located at Jurong West, has seen a total of 16 HFMD cases from 3 to 12 Mar 2015.

Health experts said current trends suggest that the number of weekly cases may continue to remain higher than last year's. More information can be found at the Health Ministry's website.

[Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease of infants and children. It is characterized by fever, painful sores in the mouth, and a rash with blisters on hands, feet and also buttocks. It is prevalent in many Asian countries. Outbreaks of HFMD occur every few years in different parts of the world, but in recent years these have occurred more in Asia. Countries with recent large increases in the number of reported cases in Asia include: China, Japan, Hong Kong (China), Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Viet Nam. HFMD outbreaks have been frequent in Singapore and neighbouring countries and are probably indicative of common features of rearing of children.

Viruses from the group called enteroviruses cause HFMD. There are many different types in the group including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses and other enteroviruses.

HFMD is most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A16, which usually results in a mild self-limiting disease with few complications. However, HFMD is also caused by other enteroviruses, including enterovirus 71 (EV71), which has been associated with serious complications, and may be fatal. - Mod.CP]
