Darchula District, with a population (2011) of 133 274 residents, in western Nepal, is one of the nine districts in Sudurpashchim Pradesh Province and one of 77 districts in Nepal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darchula_District). Darchula District is immediately north of Baitadi District, the location of the outbreak of scrub typhus reported recently by ProMED-mail about 2 weeks ago (Scrub typhus - Nepal (02): (BT) 20200813.7675023).

The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to the infected chiggers, but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792) and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions.

The laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated. - Mod.ML]
