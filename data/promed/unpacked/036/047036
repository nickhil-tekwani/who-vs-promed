With 12 000 commercial avocado trees already destroyed by the laurel wilt pathogen, they represent about 1.5 per cent of trees grown for farming in Florida. Avocados are [also] popular in residential landscapes.

The pathogen has now been reported in all but 6 of Florida's 67 counties, said Jonathan Crane, UF [University of Florida]. "Eventually, all Florida counties will have laurel wilt." He doesn't have specific numbers for the residential avocado tree problem.

The time from infection to tree mortality ranges from 4-8 weeks. The ambrosia beetle was discovered in the U.S., in Georgia, in 2002, and the link between the beetle and the fungal pathogen was made in 2003. The devastating disease has spread rapidly through the natural landscapes along the southeastern seaboard of the U.S.

[Laurel wilt (LW) is a vascular disease affecting species in the family _Lauraceae_. It is caused by a new fungus, _Raffaelea lauricola_, described in 2008. LW is spread by the redbay ambrosia beetle (_Xyleborus glabratus_), which is native to India, Japan, Myanmar and Taiwan. It has been suggested that the beetle was introduced into the US with packing crates and other wooden materials. Root-to-root spread of the fungus within tree stands is also suspected.

LW symptoms may include wilting and discolouration of twigs and leaves, as well as black streaks in the wood of branches and trunks. Infected trees die. Since 2003, LW has caused widespread mortality of redbay (_Persea borbonia_) in Georgia, South Carolina and Florida and has subsequently also been found on avocado (_Persea americana_). Beetle infested redbay firewood is suspected to have contributed considerably to spread of the disease within the US. Disease management relies on exclusion of both vector and fungus from new areas but may also include phytosanitation and removal of pathogen and vector reservoirs.
