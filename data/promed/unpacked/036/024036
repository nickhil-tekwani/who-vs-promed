Mercosur countries are anxiously awaiting lab results on the suspect
foot and mouth disease (FMD) cases identified on the Brazilian side
of the border with Paraguay. The suspect animals were detected more
than 30 days ago in the western Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do
Sul, not far from the triple frontier area of Argentina, Paraguay and
Brazil. Cattle from the area are viewed with suspicion by the
international beef market.
Panaftosa, the PAHO Foot and Mouth Disease center and the Permanent
Veterinary Committee (CVP) have decided to send a technical group
with representatives from Chile, Uruguay and Argentina to inspect the
area and make a detailed report of the situation.
A definite confirmation will be available only after [the results of]
viral cultures being done in Panaftosa's laboratories [are made
known]. Serological tests are of limited value, as cattle in the
affected region are vaccinated on a regular basis. These results
usually can take 30 days.

[Although suspicion is high that this is FMD, other diseases have
similar clinical signs in the early stages. The vesicles and lesions
on the mouth and feet, most often associated with FMD, may also be
signs of several other vesicular diseases. Thus, definitive isolation
is the best way to know for sure which disease is at work in the
area. - Mod.TG]
