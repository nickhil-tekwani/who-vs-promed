An explanation for some COVID-19 deaths may not be holding up
-------------------------------------------------------------
Recent studies have created doubts about an agent in cytokine storms, and suggest that treatments for it may not help. Medical researchers are raising significant doubts about whether an agent of the human immune system causes some coronavirus patients to end up in the hospital with injured lungs and other organs, struggling to breathe. What remains is a continuing mystery about what causes certain people to die from COVID-19, and how best to prevent that.

A hypothesis that emerged early in the pandemic involves cytokine storms, an immune system response that is often invoked to explain severe viral infections, and to many doctors, it seemed to make perfect sense: patients who died from COVID were found to sometimes have little or no virus in their bodies. Their immune systems got rid of it. But in doing so, the hypothesis went, their body's defenses went rogue, spewing out powerful compounds -- cytokines and other drivers of inflammation -- that fatally damaged tissues and organs in a storm.

But in a number of recent studies, some researchers say, an agent suspected of causing the storms might not be the culprit or that such storms might not happen in the way doctors believed.

Not everyone agrees. Dr Randy Cron, a professor of pediatrics and medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who has long studied cytokine storms, says some hospitalized COVID-19 patients do experience these immune overreactions. But he agrees they are not identical to the reactions seen in other disorders, and much remains to be learned.

The storm idea has so far centered on one cytokine, interleukin-6, or il-6. The belief that it might be the culprit in certain COVID deaths began with reports from China early in the course of the pandemic. Doctors there said a patient who fared poorly had high levels of il-6. The doctors tried using drugs that block il-6, and the patient recovered. Similar reports followed there and in Italy. A number of drugs that block il-6 are on the market to treat rheumatoid arthritis. They also can stop severe immune reactions in other situations, such as a cytokine release syndrome that can occur with some cancer treatments and with adult onset Still's disease, a rare form of inflammatory arthritis. But, said Dr John Stone, a professor of medicine at Harvard, "these are not infections."

Nonetheless, anti-il-6 drugs quickly became a standard of care at many hospitals treating COVID patients. The idea that they were quelling cytokine storms became widely accepted. "It is so easy to have your brain remember the cases that worked really well and ignore those that didn't work well," said Dr Bruce Walker, an immunologist who is director of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT, and Harvard and was not involved in the new studies. Now rigorous studies are failing to find that anti il-6 drugs are effective. Other studies are finding that il-6 levels are not even highly elevated in COVID patients compared to levels in other critically ill patients.

Three such studies, 2 published in JAMA Internal Medicine and one in the New England Journal of Medicine, found no evidence that a commonly used il-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis treatment, reduced the death rates in severely ill coronavirus patients.

Roche, which makes tocilizumab, did its own tests in COVID patients and reported that its drug was not helpful. [Roche Confirms Tocilizumab (Actemra (R)) failed to meet endpoints in the phase 3 COVACTA study involving COVID-19 associated pneumonia. https://www.trialsitenews.com/roche-confirms-tocilizumab-actemra-failed-to-meet-endpoints-in-the-phase-3-covacta-study-involving-covid-19-associated-pneumonia/.]

One issue is with the very term, cytokine storm. "It has no definition," said Dr Carolyn Calfee, an intensive care medicine specialist at the University of California in San Francisco. It is colorful and captured the imagination of doctors and much of the public, but with no definition, there are no diagnostic criteria to show that such a thing is taking place. And even if there is, il-6 might be a bystander rather than a driver. Hundreds of cytokines are released when the immune system goes into action. They drive and suppress one another in complex feedback loops. "You take this thing like spaghetti that is connected in so many different ways," Dr Walker said. It is optimistic, he added, to think il-6 "will be the answer to everything."

Until recently, there were no systematic studies asking if il-6 levels really were unusually high in COVID patients. It turns out that they often are not, recent research suggests. Dr Jonathan Parr, an infectious disease specialist at the University of North Carolina checked il-6 levels in his medical center's COVID patients early in the pandemic. They were difficult to interpret but generally were well below those seen in other inflammatory syndromes, like sepsis, where they are 27 times higher. Dr Calfee reviewed measurements reported in 5 studies with a total of more than 900 seriously ill coronavirus patients. Their il-6 levels ranged from normal to slightly higher.

And even when cytokine levels are sky high, as in sepsis, drugs that squelch immune reactions do not help, Dr Stone said. Failed sepsis studies go back to the late 1980s, he said, when researchers tested etanercept, a drug used to treat autoimmune diseases. It blocks another cytokine, tumor necrosis factor, which, like il-6 is released by white blood cells in sepsis patients. Etanercept turned out to increase the death rate in those patients.

Dr William Fischer, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of North Carolina, said the idea of a cytokine storm "comes up in every severe viral infection." Examples include AIDS, Ebola, flu, Lassa fever, SARS, and MERS, he said. But, he said, "it can be difficult to tease apart what drives pathology -- whether it's just the virus or both the virus and the very immune response that is needed to clear the virus. The next step should be a randomized clinical trial," in which patients are randomly assigned to receive the experimental treatment or not. Instead, Dr Fischer said, trials, if they started at all, tended to begin after tens of thousands of patients had already gotten the drugs, which muddied the ability to prove safety and effectiveness.

So if not for this cytokine storm, what could be injuring the patients? Inflammation from a variety of immune system overreactions may play a role, researchers said. One piece of evidence is that the steroid, dexamethasone, which broadly suppresses the immune system, can reduce the death rate.

But il-6 is not the only possible driver of a damaging immune response, Dr Stone said. Other inflammatory chemicals such as ferritin appear and so does CRP, a protein that is a sign of inflammation.

Many COVID patients also suffer from blood clots, which themselves might be damaging lungs and other organs. Dr Walker cites another possibility. He was an author of a study that found that the virus can destroy germinal centers, places in lymph nodes where antibodies are produced. The result can be fewer antibodies and less effective ones. [Kaneko N, Kuo HH, Boucau J, et al. Loss of Bcl-6-expressing T follicular helper cells and germinal centers in COVID-19. Cell. 2020 Oct 1; 183(1): 143-157.e13. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2020.08.025. Epub 2020 Aug 19. PMID: 32877699; PMCID: PMC7437499; https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31067-9.]

And it still remains possible that administering anti-il-6 drugs may help if done earlier or later during a patient's illness. "We need randomized clinical trials to answer these hard questions," Dr Stone said. Dr Calfee said the new findings should be teaching doctors a lesson. "We have to be really humble about biologic complexity," she said.

For now, Dr Walker said, he and many others are sadder but wiser about using anti il-6 drugs to treat COVID patients. "All of us were hopeful that this would work," he said. "It was definitely worth a try."

[The cytokine storm induced by a virus infection results in "excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines [which] leads to ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] aggravation and widespread tissue damage resulting in multi-organ failure and death." It has been thought that "targeting cytokines during the management of COVID-19 patients could improve survival rates and reduce mortality." (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01446/full). This is proving not to be the case as more patients are evaluated following treatment to reduce the cytokine storm. As suggested, a randomized clinical trial is what is needed to dissect the complexity of the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and separate the various contributing factors. This is difficult to do in the middle of a pandemic. - Mod.LK]

[2] USA: test refusals

ref: Rubin R. First it was masks; now some refuse testing for SARS-CoV-2. JAMA. 2020 Nov 6. doi: 10.1001/jama.2020.22003. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 33156334.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At a September [2020] webinar entitled, "Until we have a COVID-19 vaccine," epidemiologist Michael Osterholm, PhD, MPH, expressed concerns about insufficient testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the US. The problem has morphed from inadequate testing capacity to inadequate numbers of people agreeing to be tested, said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

In the pandemic's early weeks, when a shortage of tests meant that mainly hospitalized patients were being tested, the demand was greater than the supply. Months later, laboratories have greater testing capacity, but in some states, testing rates have dropped as cases have increased. Test avoidance appears to be a growing problem, at least anecdotally. Many of the same people who dismiss the need to test feel the same way about wearing a mask, in part because they think no one has the right to tell them to do either.

"There are challenges with the messaging, from the top to the bottom," said Charity Menefee, MA, director of communicable and environmental disease and emergency preparedness at the Knox County Health Department in Tennessee. "The [pandemic] fatigue has set in; the politics have gotten more intense."

How much testing is enough?
Testing is a key component of contact tracing, and only testing can reveal whether flu-like symptoms are due to influenza or to the much more contagious and deadly SARS-CoV-2. But most states aren't performing enough tests, as evidenced by their 7-day average positivity rates, according to the Johns Hopkins Testing Tracker. As of [23 Oct 2020], only 16 states and the District of Columbia had a positivity rate of 5% or lower, which the World Health Organization has said jurisdictions should achieve for at least 14 days before reopening. Not only does a positivity rate of more than 5% suggest greater community transmission, but it also "indicates a state may only be testing the sickest patients who seek out medical care and is not casting a wide enough net to identify milder cases and track outbreaks," the tracker's website notes.

Apparently, that's a difficult concept to grasp for some people, including the governor of Missouri. Missouri's 7-day average positivity rate reached an all-time high of 18.3% on [16 Oct 2020], a record that Republican Governor Mike Parson mistakenly attributed to increased testing, echoing similar assertions by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. "We went from like 2000 tests a week to 125 000," Parson explained to a St Louis television station.

Test anxiety
Some states might have a higher positivity rate in part because they still lack the capacity to test residents with mild or no symptoms, but some jurisdictions are waiting with open arms for more such individuals to show up for testing. Take Knox County, population approximately 470 000, in which Knoxville, Tennessee, and the flagship campus of the University of Tennessee (UT) system are located. At its peak, the Knox County Health Department was testing 500 to 600 people a day, Director Martha Buchanan, MD, said in an interview. By mid-October [2020], though, that number had dropped to 200 or so a day, she said. Meanwhile, Knox County's hospitalizations for COVID-19 had risen to an all-time high, and the average daily positivity rate for the week ending [19 Oct 2020] was 12.75%.

The decline in testing extends beyond the health department, which, Buchanan said, conducts only about 15% of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed in Knox County. In early August [2020], total weekly tests surpassed 10 000 but fell below that for the next 2 months, said Deborah Crouse, a spokeswoman for the Knox County COVID-19 Joint Information Center. By the last week in October [2020], though, it appeared that the county was heading back up to around 10 000 weekly tests, thanks to public health messaging about the importance of testing, Crouse said in an email.

In her weekly livestream briefing [16 Oct 2020], UT Chancellor Donde Plowman, PhD, noted that students who live on campus are required to provide saliva samples if the school notifies them that they need to be tested. And yet, she said, participation for the week had dropped to around 48%, down from nearly 65% the previous week. At a Knox County Board of Health meeting [30 Sep 2020], Plowman talked about a "huge" reduction in the number of students' requests for testing through the Student Health Center. "It really gets down to the fear of isolation and quarantine," Menefee said. Athletes don't want to risk testing positive and keeping their whole team off the playing field, she said. "We've been hearing more and more of that."

Likewise, parents of students at New York City Jewish schools in September [2020] circulated social media posts that advised keeping sick children home but not testing them for SARS-CoV-2 because the city health department had announced it would close schools if 2 or more students tested positive. "We encourage all New Yorkers to get tested and have worked to ensure that message is received through social media, community-based partners, local providers, and other channels," a spokesman for the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said in a statement provided to JAMA. The spokesman noted that many of the Jewish schools still had to close for at least 2 weeks in October [2020] because they're located in COVID-19 hotspots.

In Utah, a Republican state lawmaker who is among a growing number in the state declaring they won't get tested for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), recently told The Salt Lake Tribune that he worried a positive test would put him "on the radar." "The health department doesn't need to know if I'm sick or not," Mark Strong said. But, of course, the health department does need to know whether Strong or anyone else is infected with SARS-CoV-2. "It's critical for people to get tested, and for those who are positive to isolate," Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine, MD, president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), said in an interview.

That need to isolate if positive might be why some working adults avoid getting tested, said Marcus Plescia, MD, MPH, ASTHO chief medical officer. They can't afford to stay home from work, as recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). "We have to deal with some of these disincentives, and also just make it fair," Plescia said in an interview. "We have to make the health choice the easy choice. I don't think we have."

In addition, while COVID-19 doesn't carry a stigma like several other infectious diseases, some individuals still feel embarrassed if they test positive, Plescia said. They think, "I might have infected all kinds of people I might have come in contact with," he explained. On the other hand, "if you don't get tested, you don't know."

A question of autonomy
One of the arguments against testing is the same as one made against wearing masks. As a 65-year-old Utah woman, a member of the far-right Constitution Party, proclaimed to The Salt Lake Tribune, "I will not get tested [for SARS-CoV-2]. That's my right." Bioethicist Arthur Caplan, PhD, would beg to disagree. "What we don't need is people playing politics with testing," Caplan, founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at the NYU School of Medicine, said in an interview. "Ethically, it's hollow. It doesn't make sense."

But in early October [2020], several Republican senators, including Iowa's 87-year-old Chuck Grassley, declined to be tested, even though 3 of their colleagues had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 and might have infected them. At least one observer speculated that Grassley and the other senators who might have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 avoided testing because they didn't want to set back Amy Coney Barrett's nomination to the US Supreme Court.

Caplan cited a quote often attributed to the philosopher John Stuart Mill, although its origins are murky. It goes something like "your liberty to swing your fist ends just where my nose begins." The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) agrees. Employers can mandate that employees be tested for SARS-CoV-2 before allowing them in the workplace, as long as it's consistent with CDC guidelines. Such testing meets the Americans with Disabilities Act's "business necessity" standard, according to the EEOC.

A recent article by UK clinical geneticists described refusal to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 as "an emergent ethicolegal issue." Although patient autonomy is "a key pillar of medical ethics," in exceptional circumstances, such as a serious infectious disease pandemic, autonomy is overridden by competing interests, the authors wrote.

Patients who refuse preoperative SARS-CoV-2 testing put themselves and healthcare workers at risk, notes a statement from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation. If patients refuse to be tested, the ASA recommends delaying procedures until they agree to be tested and have negative results or, if they've had symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, are asymptomatic for at least 10 days.

Claiming that people need to mind their own business when it comes to refusing SARS-CoV-2 testing is "morally repugnant," Caplan said. "Of course it's other people's business. You're testing not just for yourself, but for your grandmother, and your elderly neighbor, and your immune-compromised kids."

[There are clearly multiple explanations behind testing refusal, but a lack of clear messaging from the highest levels is definitely a contributing factor. The quote that stands out best to me is "your liberty to swing your fist ends just where my nose begins." The reduction of testing feeds into my favorite adage and corollary -- "Seek and ye shall find" and "don't look and it ain't there." The testing shortages that occurred in the early stages of introduction of the SARS-CoV-2 in a number of countries back in January through April 2020, contributed to the high number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to the lack of knowledge where there was "silent transmission" ongoing related to asymptomatic infected individuals and pre-symptomatic infected individuals. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 8 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov8_1604879917.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 9.8% of daily case numbers and 23.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 21.3 million cases. Countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours include the USA and Brazil among others so the total regional daily load is approximately 25% of the usual daily reports. Without the USA and Brazil, Argentina is dominant, followed by Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Chile, Panama, and Costa Rica reported more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 68.3% of daily case numbers and 48.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 13.1 million. Countries not reporting cases today (8 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, Sweden, Belarus, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include France, followed by Italy, Poland, UK, Russia, and Germany. There were 21 additional countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 7.3% of daily case numbers and 14.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.30 million cases. Iran is dominant, with record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, Iraq, Lebanon, Pakistan, and UAE. Kuwait and Libya each reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Oman, Sudan, Somalia, and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.92% of daily case numbers and 0.99% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.35 million cases. South Africa is dominant, followed by Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Angola. Countries not reporting any new cases in the past 24 hours include Algeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, and Botswana among others.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.53% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.76 million cases. The Philippines is dominant followed by Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Guam, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 12.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 11.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 9.6 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: It is very difficult to comment other than observe the continued dominance of Europe. Today's [8 Nov 2020] weekend artifact includes many countries in Europe, the Americas, and Africa that have not submitted reports. There is an approximate 20% reduction in reported cases globally since yesterday [7 Nov 2020].

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (105 662), India (46 661), France (38 619), and Italy (32 614) have been dominant. A global total of 5857 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (7-8 Nov 2020). The global total is now above 50.7 million cases. Countries not reporting newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Costa Rica.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, India, France, Italy, Poland (24 785), UK (20 572), Russia (20 498), Germany (14 026), and Brazil (10 554). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 51 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and one is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 12.7%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 22.9%. Looking at the same comparisons in the USA, as the dominant country worldwide with clearly uncontrolled transmission, the 7-day change in daily reported cases is 39.3% and in reported deaths is 22.4%.

Impression: Even with the weekend reporting artifact leading to reduced reporting, the global daily reported cases continue to increase, and the daily increase is just below 500 000-600 000 new cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions.

All in all, the growth in the USA is exponential, having surpassed the 10 million cumulative case mark, with the state of Texas having reported over one million cases and California will be crossing one million cases in the next several days if daily reports continue at the same rate. (My apologies to Florida as I erroneously put Florida as the most likely next state to cross the 1 million case threshold when it is California) - Mod.MPP]
