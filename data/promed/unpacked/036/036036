Poliovirus weekly update, 12 Jun 2019, WHO
------------------------------
New wild poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 1
Environment: 0

New cVDPV poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 2
Environment: 0
Contact: 1

Headlines
Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan - 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case;
- Somalia - 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case; and
- Angola - 1 (1st) circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2019 remains 8.

Pakistan
- 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week from North Waziristan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, with onset of paralysis on 19 May [2019], bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in 2019 to 19.

Nigeria
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) virus was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 remains 8.
- Recent confirmation of spread of the cVDPV2 outbreak, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) response.

Lake Chad basin
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018) and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo):
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). So far, 1 cVDPV case has been reported in DRC in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri; and Kasai.

Angola:
- Circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been confirmed in Angola. An AFP case and its contact have been confirmed based on cVDPV type 2 isolates in the lab. AFP case with onset on 5 Apr 2019 is reported from Cambulo district of Lunda Notre province. Stool from a close contact of this case was collected on 23 May 2019. This district is bordering areas in DR Congo where mOPV2 rounds have been conducted in response to ongoing cVDPV2 outbreaks.

Horn of Africa
- In Somalia, 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case was reported in the past week from Bari province (Bossaso district), with onset of paralysis on 8 May [2019].
- The Horn of Africa is affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and type 3 (cVDPV3), reporting both AFP cases and environmental positive samples.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks.
- The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province, with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018].
- cVDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Outbreak response to both virus types is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle, and Middle Shabelle regions, Somalia.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia, and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains one.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological, and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

Iran
- No WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week. In total, 2 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, both from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation, and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

[Another country joins the list of having AFP cases associated with infection with a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV): Angola. The addition of Angola brings the number of countries that have reported one or more AFP cases associated with cVDPV in the past 12 months to 8.

With respect to WPV (wild poliovirus), transmission in the Pakistan/Afghanistan corridor continues with a newly confirmed case reported from Pakistan in the above weekly report, and a 2nd case reported by the End Polio Pakistan initiative yesterday [Thu 13 Jun 2019].

The absence of reports on environmental sampling does not necessarily mean that there were no positive isolates, but more than likely that there were no results from environmental samples that were ready for this week's report.

I personally remain concerned re: polio eradication in the immediate future, unless cVDPVs are not included as polio cases. Many of the low- and middle-income countries that have gone many years without confirmed cases of polio have observed lower vaccination levels, probably not unrelated to the absence of cases and perceived absence of threat. Then there are the countries where there are strong antivaccer movements that have growing pockets of susceptibles, and then there are the countries with civil unrest leading to pockets of individuals not reached by vaccination workers with opposition groups discrediting the vaccination effort, creating their own form of an antivaccer movement.
