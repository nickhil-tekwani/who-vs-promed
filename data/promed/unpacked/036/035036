[Official OIE notification of the outbreaks is anticipated, including
information on the FMDV serotype(s) involved. Data on the composition
of the vaccine applied will also be helpful.

Subscribers are referred to the most recent available periodic FMD
report of FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory (IAH, Pirbright), namely the
report which covers the period July-September 2008, at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/ref_labs/ref_lab_reports/FAO-OIE%20FMD%20Ref%20Lab%20Report%20July-Sept%202008%20.pdf>.

According to the report: "In the Middle East (Pakistan, Afghanistan,
Iran, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia), the A-Iran-05 (ASIA topotype)
has dominated for the last 3 years. However, since August 2007, a new
sublineage of this strain (named A-Iran-05ARD-07) has been found in
Turkey."

The report further says that: "The O-PanAsia-2 strain (ME-SA
topotype) continues to dominate in the Middle East region (Pakistan,,
Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia)."

According to the most recent monthly report available on the said
website, FMDV-A was identified in 2 samples collected from cattle in
Bahrain on 24 Nov 2008. - Mod.AS]
