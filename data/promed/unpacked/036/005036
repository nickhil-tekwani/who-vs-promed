Health officials are noticing an outbreak of hepatitis A, especially among the London's homeless population and people who inject drugs.

The Middlesex-London Health Unit issued a release regarding the unexpected number of cases noticed over the past few months. There have been 15 cases of hepatitis A reported to the health unit since 1 Oct 2018. This is a noticeable increase considering the health unit only expects to see about 3 cases each year, most of which are travel-related.

Hepatitis A is a disease that affects the liver. "This situation is a demonstration of the health inequities that exist in our city. The link between most of these cases is that they live on the margins of society, don't have access to stable housing, and struggle with addiction," said Dr. Alex Summers in a statement. "While we can provide vaccines to those who we know are at risk, there's a much bigger issue that exists just under the surface that needs to be addressed."

The health unit, in partnership with community organizations, is reaching out to those who may be at risk of contracting hepatitis A as part of its surveillance mandate.

[This outbreak appears to be similar in terms of its targets to the outbreaks occurring in the USA. It is refreshing to hear the Health Unit recognizing the issues underlying the problem. - Mod.LL
