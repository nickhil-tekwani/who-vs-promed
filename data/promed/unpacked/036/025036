Almost an entire crew of a Halifax-based navy ship has been sent home
after one of the vessel's crew members came down with a case of
mumps. Roughly 50 of HMCS Glace Bay's 60-person crew were sent home
on Thu 24 May 2007 as a precautionary measure, Lt.-Cmdr. Marie-Claude
Gagne said on Sat 26 May 2007.
"What we've done is we've sent home crew members that have been
exposed to the sailor in question that hadn't already been immunized
against mumps or that hadn't contracted the disease prior in life,''
she said. Gagne said the navy expects the crew will be off for at
least a week, when officials will reassess the situation. The ship
was not scheduled to participate in any naval operations, so the
crew's absence will have little effect.
A few weeks ago, crew members on another navy ship were sent home
after a crew member became ill. The crew member who was sick is now
back to work. "Similar precautions were taken with people that were
in contact with him,'' Gagne said, but she did not know how many
people were sent home.
The outbreak in Nova Scotia began in February 2007 and has continued
to grow. On Friday [25 May 2007], provincial health authorities said
302 people had been infected in the past 3 months, an increase of 30
over figures released a week earlier.
Six other provinces have reported cases of mumps, with some of those
linked to Nova Scotia's outbreak. The latest provinces to be affected
by the virus have been British Columbia and Manitoba [The others are:
New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Ontario and Alberta. - Mod.CP].
Manitoba reported its 1st 2 cases in the ongoing outbreak on Fri 25
May 2007, while British Columbia health officials were awaiting test
results on 2 more people and observing 2 others. Those 6 cases have
been linked to a sporting event in Winnipeg in early May 2007 that
drew participants from around the country, including someone who had
developed mumps in Nova Scotia. British Columbia had already reported
3 cases, though the 1st was never tested and, therefore, doesn't meet
the national criteria to be counted as a case.
The Public Health Agency of Canada, in its most recent update posted
earlier in the week, listed 45 cases in New Brunswick, 2 in Prince
Edward Island and one in Alberta. Ontario's Ministry of Health had
reported 12 confirmed cases as of Friday [25 May 2007], and officials
there were still investigating whether the infections were related to
Nova Scotia.
The majority of the patients have been young adults between 17 and 24
years old, an age group that grew up before children were given 2
shots of a vaccine against mumps, measles and rubella. The single
dose they would have received has left many unable to fend off the
virus and as a result leaves them more susceptible. Symptoms of mumps
include aches, pains, fever, loss of appetite and swollen salivary
glands, although there are more serious complications, including deafness.
