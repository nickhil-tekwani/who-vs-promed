Apart from _Y.enterocolitica_, other organisms classically associated with
pseudo-appendicitis include _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and _Campylobacter_
spp. Campylobacter would normally cause occasional cases of
pseudoappendicitis [mixed in amongst many more conventional cases of
diarrhoea.

A lot of people have looked, but the _Yersinia_ that can be isolated are
not pathogenic. The age is a little old but this is reminescent of Pigbe
l(enteritis necroticans) in Surin [sic and elsewhere in Asia.
How about trying anaerobic cultures for _Clostridium perfringens_? The
problem is telling the beta toxin+ from those that are non toxigenic. This
epidemic is described in Lancet by Johnson, S et al 1987:ii:496-500. As I
remember, after J. Sakurai had shown that these isolates produced beta
toxin, Drs Eampokalap and Kimakorn, I think at Rama and Chula
[universities? prepared the gross description and tissue blocks, and
these blocks were examined by Cooke and Lawrence in Australia. Could we
report cp [ _Clostridium perfringens_ in Cambodian children. I think we
still have some reprints of Stu's paper if anyone is interested.

According to reference [below, 20% of older children and young
adults with _Y. enterocolitica_ can mimic appendicitis, a fact that has
caused epidemiologists to suspect _Y.e._ when there are increases in
appendectomies in a locality.
Easiest and most universal is Benenson A.S., APHA "Control of Communicable
Diseases
Manual" Sixteenth Ed., 1995.
