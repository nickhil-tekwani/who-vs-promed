Devil disease reaches Tarkine
-----------------------------
The discovery of sick Tasmanian devils in one of the endangered
species' last strongholds has strengthened calls for the Tarkine to be
heritage listed.

Researchers from the 'Save the Tasmania Devil' program recently found
2 cases of the devil facial tumour disease at Takone, near Wynyard, on
the border of the rainforest area.

Conservationists have been calling on federal environment minister
Tony Burke to protect the Tarkine, and subsequently the last pocket of
healthy devils, for more than 2 years. The last advice from Mr Burke's
office was that the Australian Heritage Council was still assessing
the area's values.

Both the Tasmanian and Australian Greens yesterday [8 Nov 2011] said
news that the Tasmanian Devil facial tumour disease had spread further
into North-West Tasmania meant that time for debate over the Tarkine's
protection had expired.

Greens MP [member of parliament] Paul O'Halloran said Mr Burke must
immediately place an emergency heritage listing over the rainforest
area.

"The disease is slowly approaching the Arthur River which is the last
major natural barrier preventing diseased animals moving into the
Tarkine region," Mr O'Halloran said.

In 2009, then federal environment minister Peter Garrett exercised
rarely used emergency powers to give the Tarkine immediate national
heritage protection in the face of the State Government's
controversial plans to build a tourist and logging road in the
Tarkine.

That emergency listing was allowed to lapse when former premier David
Bartlett shelved the plan.

Senator Christine Milne said alarm bells over the fate of the devil
had become death knells as the transmissible cancer moved across the
Murchison Highway towards the doorstep of the devil's final
stronghold.

Senator Milne said proposals to develop mines in the area further
increased the risks to devils and other wildlife.

[More information on this cancer can be found in ProMED-mail post 20100102.0019. Readers are encouraged to review this posting and
moderator's comments regarding this cancer and what has been learned
about it. Sadly, a method of preventing it, or treating those affected
has not yet happened.

Two cases in the Tarkine is not a good situation. It seems the disease
has moved into this region, once believed to be a stronghold. This
dire pronouncement begs for action to protect other regions. They must
protect the Arthur River Area if the devils have a hope of surviving.

[The Tarkine, named after the Aborigines who once lived there, is
located in the north west of Tasmania. It includes the Southern
Hemisphere's largest single tract of temperate rain forest and the
greatest concentration of Aboriginal sites in the country, and is the
habitat for more than 50 threatened species. See map at
