This morning I received this e-mail and then searched your archives
and found nothing that pertained to it. Does anyone know anything
about this problem?
"Have you heard of an epidemic in Guangzhou? An acquaintance of mine
from a teacher's chat room lives there and reports that the
hospitals there have been closed and people are dying."

Take precautions when traveling abroad
----------
The public should take precautions when traveling abroad and tell
doctors if there are signs of fever or infections that do not abate
and are unusual, says Secretary for Health, Welfare & Food Dr Yeoh
Eng-kiong.
Commenting on the problem of pneumonia on the Mainland, Dr Yeoh said
the Department of Health has already touched base with the Guangdong
authorities to learn more about the type of infection prevalent
there. The department will also determine whether there is any
particular risk of that infection coming to Hong Kong.
He assured the public that the Government is always on the alert, as
the Department of Health has a very good communicable disease
surveillance system.
Coupled with the network of reporting sources both from the public
and private sectors, as well as communication channels with
authorities on the Mainland and Macau, the Government is informed of
any infections that may spread to Hong Kong.
He called on the public not to be unduly concerned.
"We'll certainly be doing our part as the health authorities, but
individuals should always take precautions when they travel aboard,"
he added.

[ProMED-mail appreciates the preliminary information above from Jack
Soo and would be grateful for any additional information. The
etiology and extent of this apparent outbreak of pneumonia are
unclear, as is whether the outbreak is secondary to influenza. -
