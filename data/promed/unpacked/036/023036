Batala (Punjab),on [Thu 16 Mar 2017] (PTI) 1 child died and 27 others fell ill after taking the "prashad" [generally a food offering at a religious gathering- Mod.TG] at a "gurdwara" [a religious gathering - Mod.TG] in Guru Nanak Nagar here, police said.

The victims, who took the "prashad" last night [Wed 15 Mar 2017] , were admitted to the civil hospital as well as private hospitals, while 4 of them were referred to Guru Nanak Dev Hospital in Amritsar after their condition turned critical. The deceased was 1.5-year-old, BS, a resident of Guru Nanak Nagar. The other children who fell ill also belonged to the same locality, police said.

Priest Paramjit Singh, who distributed the "prashad" after performing the "Rehras Path", [religious ceremony - Mod.TG] was taken into custody, they added.

After the incident was reported, Gurdaspur Deputy Commissioner Pardeep Aggarwal, civil surgeon HS Ghai and Senior Superintendent of Police Deepak Hilori, reached the spot and launched a probe. A Health department team has collected a sample of the "prashad" and sent it to the laboratory, police said.

The father of the deceased child, said both of his sons started feeling uncomfortable after reaching home from the gurdwara. While his younger son, BS, died; the condition of the elder son, AS, was stable, he added.

[This is a very tragic story for this family and for other families as well. The India Times has updated the story to indicate 30 individuals from this situation have died.

Without clinical signs it is difficult to impossible to understand what may have been in the food offering resulting in the deaths. Hopefully the investigation will find the source of the problem and the findings will be published. - Mod.TG
