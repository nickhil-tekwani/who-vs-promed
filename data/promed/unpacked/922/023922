UNDIAGNOSED DISEASE, POTATO - NIGERIA (02): LATE BLIGHT

Plateau State accounts for 95 per cent of Nigeria's potato production, and potatoes are actually exported to Ghana, Niger, Chad and other countries. The federal government announced that it has secured a loan from the African Development Bank to support mass production of Irish potatoes.

A down-side to a possible potato revolution is a recent breakout of a disease called potato blight which ravaged many potato farms in the state. A potato farmer said the outbreak of the disease will no doubt affect this year's [2017] production output, but expressed hope that when the loan is eventually disbursed and utilised for what it was meant for, it would address such a problem in the future.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism (oomycete) _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 per cent crop loss. The pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. In potato, it affects leaves as well as tubers; in tomato, it causes lesions and rotting of leaves, stems and fruits. The disease is favoured by cool, moist conditions. It can spread rapidly within a crop and destroy it within a few days. Under favourable conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

PLB is spread by plant material (including seed tubers, plant debris and volunteer crop plants), mechanical means (including human and insect activities), wind and water. Disease management requires an integrated approach and may include removal of pathogen reservoirs, crop rotation, preventive fungicide treatments of planting material and fungicide sprays of crops.

Late blight is considered an increasing problem worldwide. More virulent strains with additional fungicide resistances and increased yield losses are emerging frequently. Farm saved or uncertified seed tubers have often been reported as sources of PLB outbreaks in the past. Thus, seed tuber certification schemes have been set up in many countries. Development of resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the pathogen. Clean planting stock (potato seed tubers; tomato seeds or explants) and management strategies for fungicide resistance of the pathogen are considered vital to control PLB in the future.

PLB was reported from Nigeria's Plateau State previously (ProMED-mail post 20140611.2533396). Recently, an undiagnosed disease with symptoms resembling PLB was reported in the state (ProMED-mail post 20170828.5278346) and farmers were advised to seek a scientific diagnosis. It is not clear if this has occurred or how the statement above has been arrived at.
