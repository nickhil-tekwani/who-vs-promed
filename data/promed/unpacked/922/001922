Although health authorities have linked a salmonella outbreak to
alfalfa sprouts served at Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches in
Illinois, the company's owner said not all victims reported eating
sprouts. In a 21 Dec 2010 letter to franchisees, Jimmy John Liautaud
said 28 of 40 salmonella victims interviewed by public health
officials reported eating at Jimmy John's. Of those, 25 reported
eating sprouts, he said.

The Illinois Department of Public Health confirmed 43 cases of
illness involving the same salmonella serotype. Many victims, the
department said, reported eating sprouts at Jimmy John's restaurants
in 10 Illinois counties: Adams, Champaign, Cook, DuPage, Kankakee,
Macon, McHenry, McLean, Peoria and Will.

In his letter, Liautaud said the Champaign, IL-based chain is
temporarily removing sprouts from Illinois menus while awaiting
direction from the state. "No source has been found yet, this is a
precautionary measure," according to the letter.

The company's main supplier of alfalfa sprouts tested negative for
salmonella on 17 Dec 2010, Liautaud said, and restaurants tested to
date were also negative. The state also asked Jimmy John's to test
all food-handling employees at 2 restaurants in Champaign. Those
tests were still ongoing.

Salmonella Outbreak Investigation
Dozens of illnesses being linked to alfalfa sprouts
-------------------
The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), working in
conjunction with local health departments and the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is investigating a Salmonella
outbreak (Serotype I 4,5,12,i-). Many people who have become ill
reported eating alfalfa sprouts at Jimmy John's restaurants in 9
counties in Illinois - Adams, Champaign, Cook, Kankakee, McHenry,
McLean, Peoria, Will and Winnebago. The Department has received
reports of 46 Illinois resident becoming ill with this serotype of
Salmonella since [1 Nov 2010].

In the course of this ongoing investigation, the Department is
investigating alfalfa sprout producers and suppliers. Produce testing
for Salmonella is ongoing.

If you have eaten alfalfa sprouts and become ill with diarrhea and
fever, call your physician and your local health department.

Symptoms of Salmonellosis (illness caused by Salmonella bacteria)
include diarrhea, vomiting, fever and/or stomach cramps. Illness
usually develops within six to 72 hours after being exposed to
Salmonella bacteria and generally lasts 3 to 7 days. Some individuals
who are infected may have no symptoms at all but may still transmit
the Salmonella bacteria to others. The spread of Salmonella from
person to person may be avoided by careful hand washing with soap and
water, particularly after using the restroom.
