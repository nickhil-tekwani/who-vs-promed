[It seems we may have had a translation error. The 1st report quoted
infected "beef". It now appears it was a pig. My previous comments stand. As
the infective dose for swine is significant higher than for ruminants, it is
unlikely that the source was contaminated soil. Cutaneous infections from
soil are extremely rare. - Mod.MHJ]

[I have spoken with] Michael Chubirko, Head Physician at the Regional State
Epidemiological Surveillance Centre of Voronezh. He confirmed all the
information about anthrax in the village of Veliky Marky in the district of
Kamensk.
Only one difference: it was a case in a pig, Mart 2. It was not determined
exactly, but the local veterinarian supposed that the source of the microbes
was some contaminated forage. The 1st known case of anthrax in the village
of Veliky Marky was in 1907, the most recent one in 1950.

According to the information from the state sanitary epidemiological
surveillance system, a case of anthrax has been registered in the city of
Kamensk. During a test of slaughtered animal meat, infection was detected in
the skin. It was determined that 5 people were in contact with the infected
slaughtered animal; they all were isolated and are under medical observation.
The infection occurred in the village of Marki in the city of Kamensk. The
last time the dangerous pathogen was identified was in the 1950s. However,
according to the chief of sanitary epidemiological surveillance center
Mihail Chubirko, the [spores of _Bacillus anthracis_] can survive in the
soil for many years. Swine breeding is widespread in the village of Matki,
and swine very often dig in the soil, where the virus is preserved.
According to Mihail Chubirko, the village of Marki is on sanitary
epidemiological quarantine as a focal point for anthrax. There are 800 focal
points for anthrax in the Voronej region, includes the city of Kamensk.
