After sending a piece on PepMV (a potexvirus) earlier today, I realized
that I had made an error in my comment section for which I sincerely
apologize. I had included information about Potato mild mottle tobamovirus
which was not germane to the piece in any way.
The amended text is as follows:
[It is no surprise that PepMV has appeared in Hungary. PepMV is extremely
infectious, and I suspect that infected tomato transplants or
PepMV-contaminated tomato seeds were used at the production site. 1st
detected in pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) growing along the coastal regions
of Peru in 1980, PepMV was identified in 1999 as the causal agent of a
severe tomato disease in commercial greenhouses in the Netherlands and has
subsequently been reported as a serious problem in greenhouse tomatoes
throughout Europe, Canada, and the United States. Disease management
depends on use of virus-free seed and transplants, and non-infested
equipment. To minimize the risk of spread and carryover of PepMV in
greenhouses where the disease already occurs, strict hygiene must be
employed at all stages of crop production and thorough clean-up procedures
between crops. - Mod.DH]
I sincerely apologize for the error.
