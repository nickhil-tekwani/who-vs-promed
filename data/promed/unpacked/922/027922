Swiss scientists say that a mosquito capable of spreading the deadly West
Nile virus has been detected in central Europe for the 1st time. Zurich
University researchers say the Asian rock pool mosquito [_Aedes_ (or
_Ochlerotatus_) _japonensis_] has colonized an area of 1400 square
kilometres (540 square miles) in central Switzerland. Parasite expert
Alexander Mathis said on Friday [28 Aug 2009] that the insect's larva was
found in 122 of 3500 locations tested. This indicates the species has
gained a foothold and is spreading.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says lab
research shows the mosquito can spread Japanese encephalitis and West Nile
virus.

The species is native to Japan, Korea, and China. It is also found in North
America and has previously been detected in France and Belgium.

[This is a mosquito species on the move. Its establishment in Central
Europe is of concern, given its vector capacity for viruses of public
health importance. In the United States, West Nile virus has been isolated
from pools of _Oc. j. japonicus_ captured in Westchester county, New York
state, and New Jersey (see ProMED-mail archive numbers 20000905.1515 and
20020824.5132). This species has been shown to transmit West Nile, Japanese
encephalitis, LaCrosse, Eastern equine encephalitis and St Louis
encephalitis viruses experimentally in the laboratory.
