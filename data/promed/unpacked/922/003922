The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Western Australia [WA], has confirmed the detection of citrus canker on 3 properties in the state's north, linked to imported plants from the Northern Territory [NT].

The department has conducted tracing and testing of plants imported from Darwin [NT], where citrus canker has been detected [ProMED-mail post 20180420.5758744]. Department Biosecurity's Mia Carbon said test results had confirmed the disease in citrus plants which were traced to 2 retail businesses at Kununurra [WA]. It has also been confirmed in a citrus plant at a property at Wyndham [WA].

"The infected plants on the properties have been removed and destroyed to minimise the risk of the disease spreading," Dr Carbon said. "It is vital we work together with industry and the Kununurra and Wyndham communities to contain this disease and protect our important citrus production.

[Citrus canker (CC) is caused by the bacteria _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar _citri_ (Xac; synonyms _X. campestris_ pv. _citri_, _X. citri_) or _X. a._ pv. _aurantifolii_ (Xaa), depending on the region. The disease is now present in most citrus growing areas worldwide. Australia was considered the only exception after CC had been officially declared eradicated (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528).

CC affects most commercial citrus varieties as well as other members of the family _Rutaceae_. Different Xac strains can vary in host specificity, for example lime-specific strains which do not affect orange or grapefruit (ProMED-mail post 20170920.5330396). CC can destroy an entire crop and poses a serious economic threat to citrus industries. Symptoms may include blister-like formations (cankers) on fruit, leaves and branches leading to defoliation and premature fruit drop, as well as twig dieback and general tree decline. Although the taste of the fruit is not affected, it cannot be sold or processed.

The bacteria can be transmitted by mechanical means, water or insects within groves, while long-distance spread occurs mostly by infected plant material. Disease management relies mainly on phytosanitation and use of clean planting and grafting material but may also include bacteriocidal sprays and use of less susceptible crop varieties. Planting of windbreaks to reduce the number of insects present in groves that can cause wounds on leaf surfaces serving as ports of pathogen entry may also be used to reduce CC incidence.

For Australia's 2004 outbreak it was thought that CC was brought into the country with budwood illegally imported by a commercial grower from the Emerald area. Although eradication of plant pathogens in an open field situation is hardly ever successful, CC was declared eradicated in 2009 following a National Citrus Canker Eradication Program (ProMED-mail post 20090206.0528). In contrast, in the USA CC eradication has been declared not to be feasible.

Other species in the genus cause important diseases in a range of crops, for example banana xanthomonas wilt (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). Genome sequencing of species and pathovars of _Xanthomonas_ is providing information on mechanisms of bacterial virulence.
