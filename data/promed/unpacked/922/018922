Interview: Schmallenberg virus to be addressed properly: expert
-----------------------------------------------------
As a new virus was found infecting at least 4 livestock farms, and 33
livestock farms have reported suspicious cases on Friday [23 Dec
2011], experts warned that the Schmallenberg virus needs to be treated
properly.

"We don't know how big this outbreak will be. This is too early to
say. Fortunately the season of the midge, the insect that is most
likely to spread the virus, is almost over now," said Wim Van der
Poel, a researcher and virologist at the Central Veterinary Institute
(CVI) in the Netherlands.

He added that the specific virus, which caused birth defects by lambs
and calves such as hydrocephalus, stiff articulations, crooked necks
and even dead births, is a variety that was never seen before.

In order to map the extent of the virus, the Dutch Ministry of
Agriculture announced a notification obligation for farmers on
Wednesday.

"As soon as a [farm] reports a suspicious case, blood [samples] of the
mother animal and brain tissue of the lamb will go to the CVI. So far
we have researched around 30 cases," Van der Poel told Xinhua.

Van der Poel said in August and September this year, over 80 livestock
farmers in the Netherlands reported diarrhea, fever and a decrease of
milk yield of their livestock to the Healthcare for Animals (GD). But
the animals recovered while the cause of the disease was not found.

In November, the German Friedrich Loffler Institute took blood samples
of sick cattle in Germany and found a new virus that they called the
Schmallenberg virus, which was named after the place where the
outbreak occurred.

According to the CVI, further research needs to be done in order to
understand the history of the virus. It is shown that the virus shows
resemblances to the Akabanevirus, which is a well-known
disease-causing organism detected by ruminant animals in Asia and
Australia.

"We have never seen this variety of the virus before," Van der Poel
said.

The most important transmission route of the virus family to which the
Schmallenberg virus belongs is via vectors (midges). At this time of
year the vectors are no longer active.

According to the experts at the Dutch National Institute for Public
Health and the Environment, the information available indicates that
while transmission of the virus to humans cannot be excluded, it is
highly unlikely.

"No symptoms in humans have been detected, even during the months of
August and September 2011, which veterinary institutes show to have
been the peak incidence of infections in cattle," the Dutch Ministry
of Agriculture said in a press release.

Livestock farmer Gert van de Bor has 1000 sheep and a few calves. So
far there were no indications of malformed lambs or calves at his
farm. "But the sheep are about to give birth again, so we will have to
wait and see how that goes," Van de Bor told Xinhua.

Re: Schmallenberg virus - Europe (07): (Belgium) congenital
malformations, ovine
-------------------------------------------
I don't suppose there was a lot of lupin or astragalus in the hay
fields of Europe this year?

The virus might be an incidental finding.

[It seems that the findings of the German, followed by the Dutch and
Belgian investigators, are indicative of SBV highly suspicious to be
the etiological agent behind the malformed animals (so far,
particularly sheep). The final proof might be expected, probably, from
experimental infection trials in pregnant animals.

Dr Baker's comment reminds the initial deliberations during the early
stages of the appearance, in northern Israel, of arthrogrypotic calves
(starting December 1969; hydranencephaly appeared in calves 2-4 months
later) and of AH (Arthrogryposis-hydranencephaly) lambs and kids
(starting January 1970). Several main lines of possible etiologies
were initially considered: toxic, environmental, genetic and
infectious. The long DD list of potential causes of the (hitherto
unknown) phenomenon included, inter alia, toxic plants, insecticides,
herbicides, radiation (thyroid glands collected in slaughterhouses and
tested), past vaccinations, genetics, and several infectious agents -
in particular Bluetongue, a virus known to (seasonally) circulate in
Israel.

The epidemiological investigations in sheep and goats led, in mid
1970, to the following conclusions:
1. The epizootic was caused by an infective agent, possibly
insect-borne, which was active in the northern part of Israel, mainly
in lower altitudes, during the months October - December 1969.
2. The agent caused abortions in sheep and goats.
3. The agent caused malformations, mainly hydranencephaly, in fetuses
between 30 - 50 days of gestation. No malformations were caused in
fetuses during the last 100 days of pregnancy.
4. Peak months of the syndrome were February-March. In badly affected
flocks, 50 percent of all lambs and kids were abnormal during these
months.
5. No clinical symptoms were seen in pregnant animals.
6. Males, twins and goats were more affected than females, singles and
sheep.
7. The vector could be similar to the one transmitting bluetongue.

The assumption that the pathological changes were due to an infective
agent, active during the autumn months, received support from the
finding of high levels of immunoglobulins in the pre-colostral sera of
calves and lambs; no elevation was seen in unaffected offspring. Tests
of these samples for bluetongue were, though, negative. The identity
of the pathogen remained obscure.

Following the later discovery, in Japan (1974) and Australia (1975),
that their respective major AH episodes had been caused by the Akabane
virus (kept in a Japanese collection since 1960), a retrospective
examination of pre-colostral sera from the 1969/1970 event, kept
frozen since, was carried out by the Kimron Veterinary Institute in
Israel (1975). It revealed antibodies to Akabane virus (antigen kindly
provided by the Japanese investigators). Sera, collected in 1975 from
cows older than 5 years from farms which had been affected in 1969/70
and from unaffected farms, revealed Akabane-seropositives only in the
cows from affected farms. - Mod. AS.
