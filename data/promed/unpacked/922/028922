A multi-country outbreak of salmonella infection that has sickened mainly young people has been linked to chocolate products made by Ferrero. Nearly 100 people are thought to be affected in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Italy is also checking if some of its analytical results are connected to the monophasic _Salmonella [enterica_serotype] Typhimurium outbreak.

The UK has the most infections with 57. Those unwell have sample dates between December 2021 and March 2022, with the majority confirmed between February and March [2022]. All cases are 18 years old or under, with around 60% under the age of 5, and more females than males affected. At least 9 patients linked to the outbreak were hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.

Dr Lesley Larkin, surveillance lead, gastrointestinal pathogens and food safety (One Health) at the UK Health Security Agency, said: "We are investigating a number of cases of salmonellosis that have occurred across the UK alongside the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Food Standards Scotland and in conjunction with Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales, and Public Health Agency Northern Ireland. Information gathered from those affected and microbiological data from whole-genome sequencing has identified that the cases are linked."

The FSA and Food Standards Scotland are advising consumers not to eat certain Kinder products with "best before" dates between 11 Jul and 7 Oct 2022. Selected batches of Kinder Surprise 20-gram and 20-gram x 3 pack are implicated and were manufactured in Belgium.

Investigations have found a link between cases of salmonella across the UK and a product made by Ferrero.

Tina Potter, FSA head of incidents, said it was important that consumers follow the agency's advice to avoid the risk of being ill due to salmonella. "We know that these particular products are popular with young children, especially as Easter approaches, so we would urge parents and guardians of children to check if any products already in their home are affected by this recall. The food business involved has voluntarily carried out this product withdrawal and recall, and we are working closely with them and their competent authorities to identify the precise cause of this outbreak," she said.

Initially, a rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) notification was published by the European Commission, but this was later removed from public view while member states investigated the incident. It revealed France had 17 patients, Germany had 6, Sweden had 4, and the Netherlands had 2.

Information from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had suggested a multi-country foodborne outbreak was caused by chocolate products. The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the Health Service Executive (HSE) are investigating the ongoing food poisoning outbreak. Ireland has recorded 10 cases with the same strain of salmonella responsible for the UK outbreak. A number of these involved young children, who have recovered.

Before the link was made to Ferrero, an ECDC spokesperson told Food Safety News the majority of cases were below 18 years old, and some of them had been hospitalized. Chocolate was suspected due to findings from patient interviews.

A spokesman for INFOSAN told Food Safety News that it was part of the incident as it involved a non-EU country, which was the UK, and salmonella in a ready-to-eat food. "We have been informed of the salmonella outbreak in the UK on 27 Mar [2022] via WHO internal channels and surveillance partners. The INFOSAN Secretariat is in the process of gathering more information on further international distribution and the source of the outbreak," he said.

Ferrero has issued a product withdrawal and recall whilst investigations continue. In a statement, the company said none of its Kinder products released to market have tested positive for salmonella, and no consumer complaints have been received. "We are working with retailers to ensure that these products are no longer available for purchase. If you have one of these products, you are advised not to consume it. We take food safety extremely seriously, and we sincerely apologize for this matter."

[It appears that a number of countries in Europe are now involved. It appears that a monophasic variant of _S._ Typhimurium is involved. The serovar Typhimurium (4,[5],12:i:1,2) is the most frequently isolated serovar in cases of salmonellosis in Europe, and its monophasic variant (4,[5],12:i:-) has been increasingly responsible for _Salmonella_ outbreaks in humans.

"Kinder Surprise (Italian: Kinder Sorpresa or Ovetto Kinder), also known as Kinder Egg or Kinder Surprise Egg, is a milk chocolate consisting of a chocolate egg surrounding a yellow plastic capsule with a small toy inside. Manufactured by the Italian company Ferrero since 1974, [. . .] Kinder Surprise was originally created with children in mind, replicating an Italian Easter family tradition in which adults give children large chocolate eggs with toys inside. However, Kinder Surprise toys have become collectible for adults as well. Since 1974, 30 billion Kinder Surprise eggs have been sold worldwide."(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinder_Surprise) - Mod.LL
