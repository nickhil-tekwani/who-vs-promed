2 outbreaks of trichinellosis in Croatia
------------------------------------
In February 2003 there were 2 outbreaks in east Croatia, i.e., east Slavonia.
The first one in Vukovar with 4 patients from 2 families (8 members in
total). The source of the infected meat was a domestic pig in which
_Trichinella spiralis_ was confirmed by trichinelloscopy.
The second outbreak was near the city of Osijek, also in east Slavonia.
There were 20 patients with clinical symptoms of trichinellosis; about 100
people came in contact with the suspect meat. The source was also domestic
pigs, but from 3 different locations. _Trichinella spiralis_ was confirmed
by veterinary examination of the suspect meat.

[The experience from Poland show that products labelled as pork may
sometimes be mixed with meat from wild animals. 298 human cases were
reported in Croatia in 1998, and 52 food-borne outbreaks were reported from
1993 to 1998 (Source: Gideon). - Mod.EP]
