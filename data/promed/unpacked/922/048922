Anthrax-related cattle death confirmed near Lloydminster
----------------------------------------------------------
Following the province's 1st anthrax-related cattle death of 2007
[sic, see comment below: - Mod.MHJ], a federal government
veterinarian says environmental factors favour another outbreak like
the one that killed more than 800 cows in Saskatchewan last year
[2006]. Sandra Stephens, a veterinarian with the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency (CFIA), confirmed on Monday [11 Jun 2007] that one
cow died of anthrax on a farm near Lloydminster in late May. Although
4 additional deaths on the farm have since been ruled as unrelated to
anthrax, approximately 750 cows have been part of a standard 21-day
quarantine since that time.
In 2006, 804 cows died as a result of the bacteria, which grows
rapidly under wet conditions. Most of those deaths occurred in
east-central and northeastern Saskatchewan.
The most recent death is west-central Saskatchewan's first since
2004, Stephens said. In that case, the cow likely contracted anthrax
after eating canola growing in the bed of what was once a slough near
Neilburg, which is approximately 70 km [43.5 miles] south of
Lloydminster. Given the wet spring throughout the province, Stephens
said there's a high possibility of another outbreak like last year.
"It (the probability) would be very good," she said. "We're seeing
pretty much the same environmental conditions."
While authorities wouldn't release the name or precise location of
the farm where the fatality occurred, attending veterinarian Dr.
Carmen Durovick said it was fewer than 3.2 km [2 miles] from the
Alberta border in the RM of Wilton, just south of Lloydminster.
Durovick, who diagnosed the dead animal as having anthrax, described
the bacteria as "very hearty."
Given the significance of last year's outbreak, Stephens recommends
vaccination for all cattle on the farm currently under quarantine and
for all cattle in northeastern Saskatchewan. "Every cattle producer
up there should be vaccinating their animals; bison, cattle or
whatever," Stephens said. At about USD 2 per vaccination, Durovick
said she doesn't see why cattle producers wouldn't protect their
herd. "It's not an expensive vaccine," she said. "If people are at
all worried, it's a pretty inexpensive insurance policy."

[The Canadian papers kept saying that this was the "1st" provincial
outbreak this year in spite of the 4 in February and March 2007. I
queried Sandra. She kindly replied as follows: - MOD.MHJ]

I believe the problem is the media. The May case in the Lloydminster
area was the 1st case seen in cattle on pasture. It was clearly
indicated to the reporter that we had 4 premises with confirmed
anthrax deaths in February and March of this year; but they chose to
write what they did!

[Sandra kindly provided a map of the 2006 and 2007 outbreaks in SK
and this May outbreak is way to the west of all the 2006 cases.
Lloydminster is a town actually on the AB/SK border on Highway 16
between Edmonton and Saskatoon. Neilburg is 70 kms [43.5 miles] SSW
of Lloydminster and close to Manitou Lake, so patently it is a boggy
area. It is worth checking out on MapQuest for a look at the aerial
image.
