U.S. BANS IMPORTS OF EUROPEAN MEAT AGRICULTURE DEPT
The United States Friday banned imports of all cattle and sheep from Europe
until the risk of spreading mad cow disease in this country is fully examined.
Michael V. Dunn, assistant agriculture secretary for marketing and
regulatory programs, was quoted as saying, "We made this decision to protect
human and animal health, to protect the security of our export markets, and
to protect the safety and integrity of our food supply." The stories add
that previously, USDA had restricted imports of cattle, sheep and many
products such as fresh meat and bone meal, from nine European countries
where the disease was known to exist. The action announced late Friday
expands that ban to most other European countries.
Dunn was also cited as saying that the decision to expand the import
restrictions came after two animals diagnosed with mad cow disease in
Belgium and Luxembourg went into the animal food processing system, adding,
"This import policy is science-based and consistent" with international
guidelines. The stories add that USDA will lift the import restrictions for
any country that shows it has a mad cow surveillance program that conforms
to international standards and contains adequate controls for import.
