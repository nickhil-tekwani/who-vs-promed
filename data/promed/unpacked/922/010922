------------------------------------------------
The worrying trend regarding bovine TB in the UK and the forces behind
the increase in its occurrence will probably also be quite relevant to
the situation in NZ, where there is also a sylvatic cycle in feral
Australian Brush-tailed Possums in some areas (albeit under quite
rigorous control at present). This situation emphasizes the dangers
that arise from relatively insidious infectious diseases when good
general biosecurity and internal animal health controls are backed
away from, or become otherwise pre-occupied with other immediate
threats.

The proposed future vaccine-based approach to control the disease in
the primary host (ie. cattle) would be quite novel for an infectious
agent like _Mycobacterium bovis_ and would superficially seem to
depend upon development of far more efficacious vaccines, as well as
significantly different field diagnostic testing technologies, to be
genuinely viable for longer term programmed eradication or
higher-order control.

Such approaches could, however, present far greater promise as
effective control tools if they could be applied effectively to
sylvatic host species, because, in that instance, the main issues
would be somewhat more limited to vaccine efficacy in the sylvatic
host and efficient vaccine delivery to such host species. An organism
like _Mycobacterium bovis_ could well be a viable oral vaccination
candidate, either directly or, probably better still, via a vectored
version (albeit difficult to gain public acceptance for vectored
vaccines [see below] because of general fears surrounding the GM
technologies behind them).

A vectored vaccine uses a "vector construct", such as the canary pox
virus (only one example), to deliver the antigenic bits (or actually
the genetic code to produce the antigenic protein bits) to the host
being vaccinated. Much easier to get approvals such as FDA given that
the bulk of the "drug" is already approved (canary pox, in this
example) which is in fact just the "carrier" or "vector." It has been
shown to work. The new FMD vaccine being worked on by Merial is
similarly based, I believe. Advantage also is you can "program" the
vector to reproduce at whatever level you want -- from lots to just a
bit -- and not spread beyond the vaccinated host.
