As of 17 Oct 2012, a total of 47 patients have laboratory-confirmed fungal meningitis. This form of fungal meningitis is not contagious. CDC's laboratory has confirmed _Exserohilum rostratum_ in clinical specimens for all but 2 patients of these patients. Of the other 2 patients, one has been found to be infected with _Aspergillus fumigatus_ and one with _Cladosporium_. These fungi are common in the environment but rarely cause meningitis.

268 cases of fungal meningitis, stroke due to presumed fungal meningitis, or other central nervous system-related infection meeting the outbreak case definition, plus 3 peripheral joint infections (e.g., knee, hip, shoulder, elbow). No deaths have been associated with peripheral joint infections.

Case counts by state are based on the state where the procedure was performed, not the state of residence.

The fungus found in tainted steroid shots matches the one blamed in the national meningitis outbreak that has killed 20 people, federal health officials said Thu 18 Oct 2012.

The match confirms the link between the outbreak and the maker of the steroids, New England Compounding Center of Framingham, Massachusetts. Officials previously said they found fungus in more than 50 unopened vials from the company, but needed more tests to determine the kind of fungus. The specialty pharmacy has been at the center of a federal and state investigation into more than 250 fungal meningitis cases. The death toll rose Thursday [18 Oct 2012] to 20. The victims in the outbreak had all received steroid shots made by the pharmacy, mostly to treat back pain. The company in Sep 2012 recalled 3 lots of the steroid made since May 2012. It later shut down operations and recalled all the medicines it makes.

The fungus was found in one steroid batch made in August 2012, according to the FDA and the CDC. The CDC has said all the illnesses so far had been tied to one lot. The fungus in the vials, _Exserohilum rostratum_, is the same as that found in at least 40 people sickened with fungal meningitis, said the CDC's Mary Brandt, whose lab did the testing. _Exserohilum_ is common in dirt and grasses, but it rarely causes illness and has never before been identified as a cause of meningitis, CDC officials have said.

Fatal Exserohilum Meningitis and Central Nervous System Vasculitis after Cervical Epidural Methylprednisolone Injection
-----------------------------
Between 21 May 2012 and 26 Sep 2012, an estimated 14 000 patients received spinal epidural injections with contaminated methylprednisolone from a compounding pharmacy, resulting in a multistate outbreak of fungal meningitis (1). The etiologic agent has since been identified predominantly as _Exserohilum_ species, a dematiaceous fungus, although a case of _Aspergillus fumigatus_ was also reported (1). The clinical and pathologic spectra of central nervous system disease due to Exserohilum remain largely unknown.

A 51-year-old woman with a history of neck pain, hyperlipidemia, headaches, and fibromyalgia presented to a local emergency department with new occipital headache radiating to the face 1 week after a cervical epidural steroid injection on 31 Aug 2012. She had not received injections previously, had no history of immune compromise or trauma, and was not taking any long-term medications. Physical examination and unenhanced head computed tomography were normal, and she was discharged. No lumbar puncture was performed.

She returned the next day with diplopia, vertigo, nausea, and ataxia and was hospitalized. Physical examination was notable only for hoarseness and decreased tendon reflexes; routine serum chemistry and blood counts were normal, and she had no fever. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on hospital day one was normal. By day 3, she remained afebrile but developed slurred speech, right hemiparesis, left facial droop, and anisocoria, prompting repeated MRI. Results showed a punctate focus of diffusion restriction in the pons [MRI imaging can be seen at the original URL - Mod.LL]. Lumbar puncture had an opening pressure of 34 cm of water, glucose level 36 mg/dL (serum glucose 105 mg/dL), total protein level of 153 mg/dL, white blood cell count of 850/cmm (84 percent neutrophils and 15 percent lymphocytes), and negative Gram stain and bacterial culture.

Treatment with acyclovir, cefepime, vancomycin, doxycycline, and methylprednisolone was initiated; however, she continued to deteriorate and developed dysphagia, leading to endotracheal intubation and transfer to our tertiary care center on day 4. Magnetic resonance imaging on transfer showed multifocal areas of restricted diffusion in the pons, midbrain, and cerebellum and diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement. Repeat lumbar puncture on day 7 showed a glucose level 49 mg/dL) (serum glucose 152 mg/dL), protein level of 104 mg/dL, and white blood cell count of 72 cells/cmm (64 percent neutrophils, 4 percent lymphocytes, and 4 percent monocytes). Polymerase chain reaction testing of cerebrospinal fluid for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and West Nile virus was negative, as were cryptococcal and histoplasma antigens and cerebrospinal fluid bacterial culture. Repeat MRI of the brain showed new restricted diffusion in the left anterior thalamus, progression of brainstem infarction and edema, and interval development of ventriculomegaly, prompting placement of an externalized ventricular drain that did not result in clinical improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck showed inflammation and possible fluid collection in the soft tissues at the injection site, although follow-up ultrasonography did not corroborate fluid amenable to tap. On day 9, neurologic examination progressed to absent pupillary, corneal, and gag reflexes, and liposomal amphotericin B was added empirically. On day 10, all brainstem reflexes were lost, and death from neurologic criteria was pronounced. Exserohilum species was reported in the cerebrospinal fluid the same day. Autopsy revealed a grossly necrotic brainstem, and microscopic examination showed angioinvasive, septate fungal hyphae associated with diffuse vasculitis (Figure, H) and hemorrhagic infarction in the brain and spinal cord.

Human disease caused by _Exserohilum_ species is rare, and fulminant meningitis has not been reported (2). To date, most pathologically confirmed cases of meningitis reported in the 2012 outbreak were caused by Exserohilum (1). In 2002, 5 similar cases of fungal meningitis complicating epidural steroid injection occurring 34 to 152 days after exposure were linked to contamination with _Exophiala_ species at a compounding pharmacy, resulting in 1 death (3, 4).

The current case shows the aggressive, angioinvasive nature of _Exserohilum_ species with an incubation time that is seemingly shorter than that of _Exophiala_, albeit to date unknown, and illustrates the need for rapid recognition and treatment (5) of this possible procedural complication in an effort to limit morbidity and mortality.

[As the cases increase, a 3rd mold _Cladosporium_ has been isolated from one case and the strain of _Exserohilum_ isolated from clinical cases seems, not surprisingly to be the same as the strain isolated from the implicated vehicle.

The 3rd posting is the 1st report of a clinical case, illustrating how aggressive the infection may be. There may be a great deal of difference in the amount of inoculum in different patients which can reflect the differences in clinical features and if the infection becomes manifest at all.

Related to the date of reporting (not date of onset), the number of cases, number of states involved, and deaths are:
