Subject: Innovations Pitch Competition: Call for Innovators, Reviewers

Competition overview
--------------------
The 4th Annual Innovations Pitch Competition, hosted at the ASTMH Annual Meeting, will focus on bright ideas to reduce risk, improve prediction and deliver better healthcare tools for outbreak-prone diseases in low-resource settings.

This year's [2021] competition will highlight tools and methods that will improve 2 of the most consequential threats to a healthy and sustainable world: resilience in the face of a pandemic and reducing the deleterious impact of climate.

The innovations proposed should be marketable, scalable, and rooted in scientific rigor. Innovations may address, but are not limited to:

- Pandemic solutions, including (but not limited to) vaccine acceptance, tracking of vaccine effectiveness, virus variant tracking, quality diagnostics, innovative approaches to prevention of disease spread, and predictive forecasting of emerging threats
- Identifying and mitigating the direct and indirect effects of climate change and its consequences of vector competency, and human and animal health

Applications for Innovators are due by 3 Aug 2021 at 11:59 pm US Eastern Time.
