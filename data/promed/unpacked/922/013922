Equine West Nile Virus Cases in South Georgia Now Total 4
---------------------------------------------------------
Georgia State reported that 2 more horses in south Georgia have been found
to be infected with West Nile virus, but are recovering. 2 other south
Georgia horses, an old mare and a 2-year-old filly, died of the disease
earlier this summer.
A vaccine that protects horses against West Nile virus will be available in
Georgia this month, state Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said on Fri
31 Aug 2001. The newly developed vaccine, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health
Laboratories Inc. in Fort Dodge, Iowa, is a killed-virus vaccine,
administered in 2 doses, that takes up to 6 weeks to become effective. It
initially was scheduled to be released on a limited basis to Florida and to
the northeastern states where West Nile virus first surfaced 2 years ago.
Following a plea from Irvin, Georgia was added to the list. The state has
no role in distributing the vaccine, however. Horse owners should ask their
veterinarians to contact wholesalers or the manufacturer, Irvin said. "We
have supplied maps of Georgia to the manufacturer to show them where we
have had problems with West Nile virus, and asked them to give those areas
top priority" in releasing the vaccine, Irvin said.
West Nile virus has been found in 25 Georgia counties so far, including
Barrow, Fulton, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties in metro Atlanta. Elsewhere in
the country, the virus has made its first recorded appearance in Alabama,
where at least 2 and possibly 4 birds have been found to be infected, and
in Kentucky, where a horse has been diagnosed but is recovering.

[In general it is not ProMED-mail policy to report experimental vaccines
and therapies, therefore the vaccine thread is cut since the state of
Georgia does not appear to be organizing the distribution of the vaccine or
arranging a controlled trial of its efficacy under field conditions. - Mod.CP
