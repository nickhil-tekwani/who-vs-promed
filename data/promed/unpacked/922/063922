[1] Maldives
Date: 5 Oct 2009
From: Mike Richards <Michael.Richards@mh.org.au>


I was enjoying a diving and surfing holiday in the Maldives at the
time of the report of 2 travellers developing chikungunya fever on
returning from the Maldives Island to Germany in September [2009].
The staff on the island at which I was staying informed me that their
resort and 2 adjacent resorts experienced considerable ill health in
July and August this year [2009]. This was at the peak of the wet
season when there was a lot of rain and many mosquitoes. All staff
involved in outdoor water activities on one island were affected.
Other staff told me that some 15 of the house staff were affected at one stage.

The apparent outbreak lasted only approximately 3 weeks and affected
at least 3 resorts. One experienced surfer working there saw this as
a mild form of dengue, which he previously experienced in Indonesia.
Symptoms where typically fever with drenching sweats, aching joints,
particularly involving shoulders, back and elbows, prominent headache
and rash in many. He believed that some had enlarged anterior
cervical glands. Typically, the fever lasted between 2-5 days, but
those affected remained profoundly lethargic for the following 2
weeks. Some of them still feel that they have not returned to full
health 2 months later. There were no gastrointestinal or respiratory
symptoms reported. This description raises the possibility that there
may have been a local chikungunya epidemic at this time, although the
possibility of dengue and other viruses cannot be excluded.

[ProMED thanks Mike Richards for this firsthand report of a possible
chikungunya virus outbreak involving resorts on the Maldive Islands.
The illnesses he describes are certainly compatible with chikungunya
virus infections, but as he points out, laboratory diagnosis is
essential for confirmation or exclusion. As indicated in the
moderator comment in ProMED archive no. 20090922.3337, "There was a
suspected outbreak of chikungunya virus infection on the Maldive
Islands in December 2008, extending into January 2009. There were no
reports of laboratory confirmation of the etiological agent(s)
involved in that outbreak (see ProMED archive number 20090114.0150).
The 2 German cases reported in ProMED archive no. 20090922.3337
provide definitive evidence of ongoing chikungunya virus transmission
in the Maldive Islands. ... ProMED would appreciate receiving further
reports of chikungunya virus infections on the Maldive Islands."

[2] Senegal (Kedougou)

The contagious diseases dengue and chikungunya have affected
pastoralists in the Kedougou region. Treatment for these diseases and
vaccines to prevent them are yet to be found. They were detected for
the 1st time in 2008 in the Kedougou region, in the department of
Salemata. Since then, more than a dozen people have been infected.

As for chikungunya: "It is an arbovirus that emerged in Africa in
2006," said Dr Sow. The virus is heterogeneous, and there has not yet
been found a specific treatment or a vaccine.

These diseases are common in West Africa in general and in particular
in Senegal. They have reemerged every 4 years since the year of their
appearance in 1972 in Asia.

[This report is unclear as to the numbers of chikungunya virus
infections among the cases cited. The statement that chikungunya
(CHIK) virus "emerged in Africa in 2006" may refer to the outbreak
that spread to the Indian Ocean Islands from East Africa in 2005.
CHIK virus and the disease it produces was 1st recognised in Tanzania
in 1952. Also, it is not clear which virus was referred to as having
appeared in Asia in 1972. The Pasteur Institute laboratories are very
capable of identifying CHIK virus and of making serological diagnosis
of CHIK virus infections. ProMED would appreciate additional
information from that laboratory concerning the occurrence of CHIK
virus infections in Senegal and other African countries that submit
samples to them. ProMED rarely has the opportunity to post reports
from that part of the world.
