Some of the world's best-known rivers, including the Nairobi River, are contaminated with antibiotics that exceed levels considered to be safe in health terms.

According to a global study conducted by York University researchers, concentrations of antibiotics found in some of the world's rivers exceed "safe" levels by up to 300 times. Sites, where antibiotics exceeded these levels by the greatest degree, were in Bangladesh, Kenya, Ghana, Pakistan, and Nigeria.

Speaking to the Business Daily, Prof Alistair Boxall, theme leader of the York Environmental Sustainability Institute, said that samples collected from the Nairobi River revealed that the most prevalent antibiotic was sulfamethoxazole.

Sulfamethoxazole is normally given in combination with trimethoprim. The research by the York team reveals that the antibiotic, which is primarily used to treat a variety of bacterial infections including urinary tract infections, was detected at 307 of the 711 sites tested.

This is not the 1st time the drug has been found to be prevalent in Kenya. In joint research between the US Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), US Army Medical Research Directorate-Kenya (USAMRD-K), Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and the University of Washington in 2017, sulfamethoxazole was discovered to be the most commonly used antibiotic in the country.

[Prior ProMED-mail posts have reported on the high rates of antimicrobial drugs and antimicrobial resistance in the environment in developing countries, such as India (see ProMED-mail posts Antibiotic resistance (04): India, China, environmental pollution 20161020.4574059, Antibiotic resistance (03): India (TG) environmental pollution 20161010.4548738, and Antibiotic resistance - India: (Delhi) E. coli, MDR, river water pollution 20151209.3850743). The dumping of untreated or inadequately treated waste from antibiotic pharmaceutical facilities in India, where a large portion of our drugs are manufactured; from hospitals; from farmland, and from residential areas, all contribute to the antibiotic and antibiotic-resistant microbial contamination of the environment.

In India and elsewhere antibiotics are over-prescribed and may also be bought directly by the populace over-the-counter without prescription. In 2010, India was the world's largest consumer of antibiotics for human health (http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001974). People who consume antibiotics can then shed antibiotics as well as antibiotic resistant microbes in urine and stool that may eventually end up in the environment when untreated or inadequately treated human sewage is dumped into waterways. This can expose people and animals to antibiotic resistant bacteria and genes that encode antibiotic resistance and create the potential for genes conferring resistance to spread to other bacteria in environmental habitats.

Similarly, in developed countries, such as the US, and elsewhere, the widespread agricultural application of triazole fungicides and antibiotics and their persistence in the environment can reduce the population of susceptible soil microbiome and act as a significant selective force for the emergence and spread of resistant genotypes. This concern has been recently raised regarding the emergence of drug-resistant _Candida auris_ and _Aspergillus_ species (ProMED-mail posts Candida auris: MDR, emergence due to agricultural use of azoles, susp. 20190407.6409119 and Aspergillosis - USA: multidrug resistance 20180928.6057087).

Concern for the emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms was also raised in recent ProMED-mail posts regarding the recent US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval of spraying streptomycin on all citrus crops in the US 3 times per year.
