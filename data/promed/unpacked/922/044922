Russia: More Children Diagnosed with HFRS in the Visokogorskiy
District of Tatarstan
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) has been
documented among schoolchildren in the village of Dachniy in the
Visokogorskiy district of the republic of Tatarstan. The 1st child
became infected on 22 Feb 2005, and at the end of February 2 more
children were diagnosed with HFRS. The next 2 were diagnosed on 18
and 19 Mar 2005, and finally on 22 Mar 2005, 5 more children were
hospitalized in the Central Region Hospital with a confirmed
diagnosis of HFRS.
The chief infectious diseases specialist, Diraya Nagimova, stated
this should be a warning alerting officials in other districts to
clean rubbish from their streets. She added that Tatarstan is an
endemic zone for HFRS and that the last serious outbreak occurred in
1997, with more than 1000 infected people. Every year about 600-700
cases are recorded in Tatarstan, and the incidence rate is 4-fold
greater than the average for Russia. The vector of the disease is the
bank vole.
By Thu 24 Mar 2005, 12 children had been hospitalized with a
preliminary diagnosis of HFRS. The diagnosis has been confirmed now
for 6 of them. The 1st case, which was registered on 22 Feb 2005, has
also been confirmed as HFRS, so in total 13 children are ill [with
confirmed or presumptive HFRS]. The youngest child is a 3-year-old.
Almost all of the others are schoolchildren with an age range of 8 to
15 years. 89 schoolchildren in the village of Dachniy are considered
to be at risk of developing HFRS, since the incubation period for
this disease is 45 days.
Physicians are carrying out regular house visits. An earlier outbreak
of HFRS occurred in December 2003, also at a school, in the village
of Aktanish. Subsequent investigation revealed that food products in
the school canteen were contaminated with mouse excrement. It has not
been determined yet how the children in Dachniy were exposed to HFRS
infection. According to Nagimova, rodent control measures have
already been undertaken twice in 2005. Infection requires inhalation
of dust contaminated with vole excrement.
The village school, a kindergarten, and a local shop have been
temporarily closed. An area around the village has been subjected to
rodent disinfestation measures.
