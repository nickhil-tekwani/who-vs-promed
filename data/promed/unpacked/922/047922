Subject: Conjunctivitis in songbirds
[David Ley in contacting Eric Shoemaker about his posting on this subject,
copied it to ProMED-mail. Editing out the personal bits, it was as follows:
- MHJ
To my knowledge the only confirmed naturally _M. gallisepticum_ - infected
songbirds have been House Finches and American Goldfinches. Therefore, the
Northern Cardinal would be a new host species if MG infection was confirmed.
Clearly, this knowledge would be very important to obtain, as determining
the number of susceptible host species will be very important to the
eventual course and impact of this outbreak.
I would encourage you to contact Dr. Kathy Converse (kathy_converse@nbs.gov)
at the NBS National Wildlife Health Laboratory for assistance in making a
definitive diagnosis of this condition in affected birds, especially if they
appear to be new susceptible species.
Good sources for more information on _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_
conjunctivitis are:

You should also be aware that there are other potential causes of
conjunctivitis in songbirds besides _M. gallisepticum_, including _M. sturni_,
a recently identified and characterized new species, which has been isolated
from European starlings, blue jays and northern mockingbirds.
