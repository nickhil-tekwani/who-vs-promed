An outbreak of pneumonic plague, a virulent disease with a high
mortality rate, was detected in Trujillo. Doctors are striving to
save the lives of 3 patients, including a resident doctor and a
medical student whose health conditions are serious.

According to the regional manager of Health, Victor Peralta Chavez,
this is the 1st time this disease has been recorded in the country.

A woman aged 29, from Mariposa Leyva sector, district Chocope
(Ascope), 40 minutes north of Trijillo, contracted the disease. The
1st symptoms occurred 5 days prior to her family taking her to
Trujillo, where she was admitted at the Regional Teaching Hospital.

With a picture of severe pneumonia (high fever, abdominal pain,
shortness of breath and other symptoms), the patient was treated for
both pneumonia and for potential influenza A (H1N1) (with antibiotics
and antivirals), but there was no improvement. The results of a quick
test [direct fluorescent antibody stain of sputum? - Mod.LL] to
detect possible pneumonic plague were negative.

A 32-year-old resident doctor, who treated and intubated the patient
during her critical condition, developed the same symptoms as the
infected woman. He was immediately hospitalized and treated, but his
health is critical. In this regard, Peralta Chavez said that the
patient's progress is not good. "This has caused multiple organ
failure, i.e. many of [his] vital organs do not work or [have]
stopped working properly. The patient is in hospital intensive care
at Victor Lazarte Echegaray," he said.

Also, last Tuesday [13 Jul 2010], a 4th-year student of Human
Medicine at the Universidad Nacional de Trujillo (UNT), who also had
contact with the infected woman, was hospitalized at the Regional
Teaching Hospital. This patient took a rapid test and tested positive
for pneumonic plague. His condition is also very delicate, Chavez said.

With these results, Peralta Chavez summoned the press and warned of a
possible outbreak of pneumonic plague at the hospital or in the
Trujillo Regional Teaching Hospital, although he clarified that this
is an imported case from Chocope, an area where plague spreads
silently and is very dangerous.

[_Yersinia pestis_ is endemic in parts of Peru, as can be seen on a
CDC map at <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/plague/world98.htm>.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an
infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland.
The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be
suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills,
headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible
exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually
becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the
bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they
spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal
condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes
the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The
infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and
breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients
are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress
rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this
posting, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of
"primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL]
