Until May this year [2018], in Romania the occurrence of African swine fever (ASF) appeared to be limited to a few cases in Satu Mare county, close to both the Ukraine and Hungary borders.

Predominantly, the figures shared from Tulcea county, close to the Black Sea, appear worrisome. In total, 249 [outbreaks] of ASF have been reported between that date and now. This included mostly backyard farms, a national park, one slaughterhouse, and one large professional farm.

The farm in Tulcea province, with 43 800 pigs, was reported infected on 29 Jun 2018. Of that total, 8 pigs were found to have died of ASF in late June 2018. To the World Organisation of Animal Health (OIE), the Romanians reported that "the actions of culling and disposing of the animals are now in progress."

Total culls of swine in Tulcea county alone now stand at 46 167 pigs and counting.

Other areas infected include Braila county (neighbouring Tulcea on the west side), Constanta province (neighbouring Tulcea on the south) and Bihor county, next to Satu Mare in the country's north. In all 3 counties, only one backyard farm was infected. The one in Bihor county had 57 porcine victims in total.

Over the last few weeks, the European Union also stepped up its efforts to control ASF. The European Commission has recently announced freeing up 10 million Euros [USD 11.7 million] for the development of a vaccine against ASF. Despite some ground-breaking research by CReSA-IRTA in Spain, a commercial vaccine is not yet available. The money will become available in the Horizon 2020 programme.

In addition, the European Food Safety Authority has indicated it will investigate the pros and cons of fencing to avoid the spread of the virus. Fencing has been suggested by some countries as a method to avoid the spreading of the virus across borders by wild boar.

A group of eminent researchers on behalf of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also recently identified that intensive hunting of wild boar might provide a solution.

In a scientific opinion, published in the EFSA Journal [https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/5344; see commentary for the abstract], EFSA experts stated that when wild boar populations are below a certain threshold, the virus simply cannot spread, as the virus is kept away from uninfected boars. In an interview with Pig Progress, Prof Zygmunt Pejsak recently suggested the same.

Despite a sea being between the European mainland and Britain, also in the UK, the developments with regard to ASF are being followed closely. The country's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) recently re-launched guidance on how to recognise the signs of ASF [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/african-swine-fever]. It has been circulating especially well on social media.

ASF been in Europe since 2006, when it was introduced in Georgia. Ever since, it spread to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. So far, it has been found in 7 EU countries, including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and Romania.

[1. According to a report published on 11 Jul 2018 by the Polish web-site vaaju.com, initially 600 pigs in the Romanian pork producing plant Carniprod were to be culled in order to save the others "if the symptoms of the disease do not occur during the next 2 weeks." But on 3 Jul 2018, "the Swedish Veterinary and Food Safety Office (ANSVSA) has announced that all animals must be killed and disposed of." Veterinary workers were recruited from 10 districts to carry out the culling operation, and 4 portable combustion plants were used for disposal. The operation was followed by cleaning and disinfection of the plant. We have not been able to obtain similar information from Romanian sources.

2. The abstract of the recent 78-page EFSA paper (Ref. 1) follows:

"The European Commission requested EFSA to compare the reliability of wild boar density estimates across the EU and to provide guidance to improve data collection methods. Currently, the only EU-wide available data are hunting data. Their collection methods should be harmonised to be comparable and to improve predictive models for wild boar density. These models could be validated by more precise density data, collected at local level, e.g. by camera trapping. Based on practical and theoretical considerations, it is currently not possible to establish wild boar density thresholds that do not allow sustaining African swine fever (ASF). There are many drivers determining whether ASF can be sustained or not, including heterogeneous population structures and human-mediated spread, and there are still unknowns on the importance of different transmission modes in the epidemiology. Based on extensive literature reviews and observations from affected Member States, the efficacy of different wild boar population reduction and separation methods is being evaluated. Different wild boar management strategies at different stages of the epidemic are suggested. Preventive measures to reduce and stabilise wild boar density, before ASF introduction, will be beneficial both in reducing the probability of exposure of the population to ASF and for the efforts needed for potential emergency actions (i.e. less carcass removal) if an ASF incursion were to occur. Passive surveillance is the most effective and efficient method of surveillance for early detection of ASF in free areas. Following focal ASF introduction, the wild boar populations should be kept undisturbed for a short period (e.g. hunting ban on all species, leave crops unharvested to provide food and shelter within the affected area) and drastic reduction of the wild boar population may be performed only ahead of the ASF advance front, in the free populations. Following the decline in the epidemic, as demonstrated through passive surveillance, active population management should be reconsidered."
