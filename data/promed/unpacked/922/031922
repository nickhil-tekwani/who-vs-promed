Human metapneumovirus outbreaks in nursing homes
------------------------------------------------
Two human metapneumovirus (hMPV) outbreaks in nursing homes last year [2012] caused severe illness and deaths and pointed out the importance of considering the virus as a possible cause of respiratory disease outbreaks in such facilities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reported today [22 Nov 2013] in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR 2013; 62(46); 909-913. http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6246a1.htm). The outbreaks occurred in skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) in West Virginia and Idaho in the winter of 2012, sickening 57 residents. A total of 45 (79 per cent) of them had lower respiratory tract infections, 25 (56 per cent) had radiologically confirmed pneumonia, and 6 (11 per cent) died, CDC reported.

In both outbreaks, molecular diagnostic testing at a state lab or CDC was required after tests for influenza and other common respiratory pathogens were negative. "Clinicians should consider hMPV infection in the differential diagnosis of illness in patients with respiratory tract infection in SNFs, particularly when clusters of severe unexplained respiratory infections are detected," the report says.

hMPV was 1st identified in the Netherlands in 2001. It causes an estimated 5 to 15 per cent of hospitalizations for lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children, and it can cause symptomatic re-infections throughout life, especially in older and immunocompromised persons. Cases typically peak in late winter and early spring.

[Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was 1st identified in 2001 in Dutch children with bronchiolitis. hMPV is an RNA virus in the _Pneumovirinae_ subfamily of the family _Paramysoviridae_, and is most closely related to respiratory syncytial virus. hMPV has been shown to have worldwide circulation with nearly universal infection by age 5. Similar to influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), activity is greatest during the winter in temperate climates. hMPV's only relative is pneumonia virus of mice (PVM).

Most of the available data on the clinical manifestations of hMPV infection are from studies of children, in whom the virus causes upper respiratory tract infections, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. As with RSV, re-infection with hMPV occurs throughout adult life, and hMPV infection has been documented in 1-9 per cent of adults each year using RT-PCR and serology for diagnosis.

Illness is generally mild in young adults, with serologic evidence of asymptomatic infection in many cases. Adults at highest risk of serious sequelae as a result of hMPV include the elderly, adults with underlying pulmonary disease, and those who are immunocompromised or, as in the present outbreak, severely disabled.

Previously, outbreaks of hMPV have been documented in long term care facilities, with mortalities of up to 50 per cent in frail, elderly residents. In addition, 6-12 per cent of exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have been associated with hMPV, and underlying lung disease is common in patients hospitalized with hMPV. Lastly, hMPV has been linked with severe idiopathic pneumonia in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplants.

Although the true spectrum of adult hMPV remains to be defined, it is clear that hMPV can result in severe illness in the frail elderly and in adults with underlying diseases.
