Equine Influenza in Mongolia
----------------------------
Mongolia's Emergency Situations Agency confirmed on 16 Nov 2007 that
since the end of October [2007], more than 8000 horses have
contracted equine influenza in the 2 western provinces of Khovd and
Bayan-Olgii, which border China.

Reports say that the 2 provinces have been quarantined, and sick
horses have been isolated and disinfected. The Mongolian government
is sending a large number of vaccinations to the area.

Mongolia is a great livestock nation with over 2 million horses.
Equine influenza last occurred in Mongolia in 1992, in Khovd. At the
time, 13 000 horses were infected.

Equine influenza is a highly contagious respiratory disease that can
cause deaths in colts and bodily weakness in mature horses, but
cannot be transmitted to humans.

[According to Mongolia's official information, the number of infected
horses is higher than the figures cited in the above Chinese news
wire. Mongolia's "immediate notification" to the OIE of 14 Nov 2007
informs that since the start of the outbreak, on 26 Oct 2007, there
have been 7 outbreaks (4 in Bayan-Uglii, 3 in Khovd), including a
total of 11 631 cases out of 101 587 susceptible horses (apparent
morbidity rate of 11.45 percent). Nine horses died. See the full
report, with map, at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=6475>.

Earlier, China reported a massive outbreak in its northern province
Xinjiang, bordering western Mongolia, which had started on 9 Oct
2007. A total of 7 counties were affected. - Mod.AS]
