Update: Canadian Food Inspection Agency investigation into feed as a possible source of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scientific testing by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) cannot confirm a link between feed containing blood plasma and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) cases in Canada.

As reported on 18 Feb 2014 [see ProMED-mail archive no 20140220.2288707], CFIA conducted a bioassay study on US-origin porcine blood plasma used in feed pellets produced by Grand Valley Fortifiers.

The study demonstrated that the porcine blood plasma in question contained PED virus [PEDv] capable of causing disease in pigs. However, the study could not demonstrate that the feed pellets containing the blood plasma were capable of causing disease.

In line with our commitment to science, the Agency will continue to analyse feed and feed ingredients, as well as epidemiological information gathered during the investigation, in order to verify that CFIA controls continue to protect Canadian livestock. In addition, the CFIA will examine any new lines of enquiry related to feed that may emerge, in particular from ongoing testing in Canada and the US.

In response to the positive test results in porcine blood plasma, the CFIA:
- activated its National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) to coordinate the feed investigation;
- followed up with farms that received the affected feed to confirm the voluntary withdrawal was effective;
- provided science-based guidance on disposing of potentially affected feed;
- worked closely with US officials to confirm that none of the affected plasma was shipped to other pig feed manufacturers in Canada.

The CFIA's investigation also included sampling and testing of feed, plasma and other feed ingredients from various Canadian and US sources associated with farms in Canada on which PED has been detected. All test results on these samples were negative for PED.

PED poses no risk to human health or food safety.

The feed investigation was triggered on 9 Feb 2014, after Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food (OMAF) testing found that US-origin porcine blood plasma used in feed pellets produced by Grand Valley Fortifiers contained PED virus genetic material. As a precautionary measure, Grand Valley Fortifiers voluntarily withdrew the potentially affected feed pellets from the marketplace.

Samples of both the feed pellets and the porcine blood plasma ingredient were submitted to the CFIA's National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease (NCFAD) for further testing. It was confirmed that both the blood plasma and the feed pellets contained PED virus genetic material; however, the bioassay study was required to confirm if this genetic material could cause illness in pigs.

The CFIA has been closely monitoring the emergence of PED since the 1st cases were reported in the US in May 2013. The Agency will continue to collaborate with provinces and territories to support their response to PED in Canada.

PED can spread rapidly through contact with sick animals, as well as through people's clothing, hands, equipment, boots, and other tools contaminated with the faeces of infected animals. Therefore, considering the characteristics of PED virus and how it spreads, adhering to good biosecurity protocols remains the best measure to prevent further introduction or spread of this disease in Canada.

[While this is good news as this plasma and this feed are not the cause of PEDv, it still raises the question of why porcine plasma is being fed to pigs. This smacks of the entire BSE incident all over again. Furthermore, as this feed came from the USA, how is mixing porcine plasma into the feed not a violation of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Title 21: part 589.200, which is a mammalian to mammalian feed ban? Plasma may be protein source but this still appears to be a violation of the CFR and yet we have heard nothing from the USA Food and Drug Administration on allowing porcine plasma to be fed back to porcines. A response from the FDA would be appreciated. - Mod.TG
