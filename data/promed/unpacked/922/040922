Health authorities say persons who have contracted the mosquito borne disease, chikungunya, should remain home as Dominica recorded more than 31 cases of the disease so far.

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is spread by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, and the island recorded its 1st case on 16 Jan this year [2014].

"The numbers keep changing on a daily basis. We have a number of suspected cases, and we have a number of confirmed cases. The last count that we have in terms of confirmed cases was 31 cases, and we have other persons who have not been confirmed. We're asking the persons with the disease to remain at home and to use mosquito [bed] nets when they are sleeping and other persons to use mosquito repellents as well," said Chief Medical Officer Dr David Johnson, adding that it was advisable that people take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of spreading the disease.

"We're asking persons to avoid the spreading of the disease or, if they are infected with chikungunya, to ensure that they sleep under a mosquito net that is treated with insecticide," he said, adding that the Ministry of Health would be sourcing treated mosquito nets for distribution.

Health authorities have said the disease has spread to several areas across the island, and Dr. Johnson said most of the cases could "be managed at home without having to admit them to the hospital."

He said there was no cause for alarm about the disease, whose symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain, rash, and joint pain. Acute chikungunya fever typically lasts a few days to a few weeks.

[The case count on Dominica has increased from 13 cases a few days ago to 31 mentioned above. Although the mortality rate from chikungunya virus infections is very small to nil, morbidity rates can be very high, and the severe, incapacitating arthralgia can persist for weeks, months, or even more than a year.

Social and Health Insurance (SZV) joined the effort to stem the spread of the chikungunya virus by launching a public awareness campaign on Thursday [20 Feb 2014]. The campaign will include the airing of a number of Public Service Announcements (PSAs) that will be broadcast in collaboration with most radio stations. The ads will start in English and will also be available in Spanish and French at a later date to reach the non-English speaking population.

Chikungunya is a mosquito borne virus that has been affecting the population of St. Maarten/St. Martin and other islands in the region for some time now.

Health Minister De Weever stressed that the fight against the virus has to be a collective effort among everyone in the community. He recommended use of mosquito nets and mosquito repellents to keep mosquitoes at bay. He appealed to businesses to maintain the current prices of items such as mosquito repellents.

Most of the 107 confirmed cases are from the Dutch Quarter, Cay Hill, St. Peters/South Reward/Cul de Sac areas; however, this does not mean that it is not in other areas.

De Weever urged residents to report their neighbours who are not cleaning their properties. He underscored the need for everyone to play a role in addressing this issue.
