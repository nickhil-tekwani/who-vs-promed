Update on Yellow Fever Epidemic in the Republic of Guinea
---------------------------------------------------------
By Thu 23 Nov 2000, a total of 190 cases and 88 deaths were reported from 6
prefectures, with 130 cases and 52 deaths having occurred in the region of
Mamou, where the epidemic obviously started. Other prefectures that
reported substantial numbers of cases are Labe, Koubia and Mali, all
located further north towards the border with Senegal. Attack rates range
from 5 per 100 000 to 52 per 100 000 (Mamou). Case fatality presently
averages 46 percent. Preliminary sequence analysis of PCR fragments
(envelope
gene) amplified from patients from Mamou revealed >90% identity at the
nucleotide level with the French viscerotropic strain of Yellow fever
virus. Serological, virological and molecular analyses are being continued
in Paris, Dakar and Marburg.
The Ministry of Health of the Republic of Guinea, WHO, PFHG, UNICEF,
GTZ/Cooperation Allemande, Medecins sans frontiere, Hopital sans frontiere,
Croix Rouge/FICR, the Japanese embassy and ACDI/Cooperation Canadienne are
presently involved in investigating and containing the epidemic. A pair of
40-person vaccination teams have vaccinated up to the present more than 90
000 inhabitants of the Mamou region.
