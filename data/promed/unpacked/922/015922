Hong Kong Health Director Margaret Can has confirmed the presence of
cholera among members of different tour groups returning recently from
Thailand, but says it was the El Tor, Ogawa strain, which is the milder
form of the disease.
Hong Kong has clearly pointed the finger at Thailand as the source of the
disease. But at the same time the Hong Kong Health Office has also
announced that of the 45 confirmed cholera cases reported so far this year,
15 were local cases.
South China Morning Post has reported the case of a 56-year-old man whose
whereabouts were traced to mainland China during the five-day incubation
period. This confirms that cholera cases existed in Hong Kong long before
the four infected tourist groups visited Hong Kong.
The threat of a full-blown outbreak has caused panic, resulting in strict
checks on passenger flights into Hong Kong from Thailand.
Because reports of cholera have damaged the Kingdoms's food exports,
Thailand in 1990 decided to report its cases on the basis of symptoms not
the disease. Cholera is currently among four diseases (small pox, plague,
yellow fever and cholera) that must be reported to WHO annually, but
Thailand reports all diarrhoea-related diseases under the same category.
Usually diarrhoea diseases occur between March and May [in Thailand, but
the first case identified among migrant workers working fishing boats in
Chumphon occurred last December.
With no change in food habits of the local people, in addition to the
expected drought, it is predicted that the number of cases of cholera will
jump this year.
Up to March this year, some 1,400 cases have been reported with 10 people
dying. Most cases occurred in the South with Surat Thani reporting 283
cases and Songkhla reporting 204 instances.
Health experts have also warned of worsening spread during the Songkran
festival in April when people go to the provinces and consume food without
care for hygiene.
