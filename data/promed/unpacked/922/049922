Using funds from Swine Health Information Center's [SHIC] Support for Diagnostic Fees program, porcine sapelovirus has been implicated in an acute outbreak of atypical neurologic disease. Paulo Arruda, Iowa State University, led a team of diagnosticians (Kent Schwartz, ISU; Albert Rovira, University of Minnesota; Jerome Nietfeld, Kansas State University [KSU]) and research assistant professor Ben Hause, KSU, through the case, acting on the request of the submitting veterinarian and owner.

The initial and final case reports detailing the discovery of porcine sapelovirus, including videos of the clinically affected pigs, are posted on http://www.swinehealth.org/sapelovirus.

To date, sapelovirus from other species have not been reported to be associated with nervous disease. In this case, a novel sapelovirus was the only agent detected associated with a unique clinical presentation of CNS disease. At least one previous case report documents the neuroinvasive potential of porcine sapelovirus in swine. However, knowledge gaps remain in disease causation (that is, Koch's postulates as yet unfulfilled), epidemiology, pathogenesis and biologic relevance of this potential pathogen.

In incidents of high or ongoing morbidity or mortality where an etiology is either not identified or there is a strong suspicion that the identified etiology is not the likely cause of the outbreak, SHIC is offering diagnostic fee support after the initial diagnostic workup is completed and paid for by the owner. In these cases, additional support for the fees of further diagnostic workup may help to identify newly introduced or emerging swine diseases. A description of the requirements, submission and review process for the Support for Diagnostic Fees program can be found on the SHIC website (http://www.swinehealth.org/shic-support-for-diagnostic-fees).

[The name _Sapelovirus_ is derived from [s]imian, [a]vian, and [p]orcine [e]ntero-[l]ike viruses.

The 3 sapelovirus species may be distinguished by i) different host species; and ii) sequence diversity. For example in the VP1 gene there is less than 50 percent amino acid identity between the species. The simian sapeloviruses (which probably belong to 3 [sero]types) have probably undergone some complicated recombination events as can be seen from a comparison of sequences in different genome regions.

The complete genome sequences of 3 entero-like viruses have been determined, porcine enterovirus 8 (PEV-8) (formerly classified within the enterovirus species porcine enterovirus A), simian virus 2 (SV2) (an unassigned member of the genus _Enterovirus_) and an unclassified duck picornavirus (DPV) (Krumbholtz et al, 2002; Oberste et al, 2003; Tseng and Tsai, 2007). These 3 viruses are related to each other (clustering together phylogenetically) and broadly resemble the enteroviruses. However, they are distinct for a number of reasons: i) they are all predicted to share a type IV (hepatitis C virus-like) internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (Hellen and de Breyne, 2007); ii) possess a leader polypeptide; and iii) have very divergent 2A, 2B, and 3A sequences such that cannot be directly compared with the same enterovirus proteins. Genetic distances from the enteroviruses in the P1cap, 2C, 3Cpro, and 3Dpol regions are large (31-37 percent; 35-45 percent, 39-52 percent, 52-58 percent, respectively). Thus they have been assigned to a novel genus, _Sapelovirus_.

In 2011, 2 new sapeloviruses were discovered in California sea lions and tentatively named California sea lion sapelovirus 1 and 2 (Li et al, 2011).

A partial sequence of a murine sapelovirus has recently been reported (Phan et al, unpublished).

Epidemiology
----------
Domestic and wild swine are the only known hosts for PSV.
PSV is not known to be zoonotic.
PSV has been found in the feces of healthy swine in Brazil, Australia, Spain, Italy, and the United States. The virus has been identified as a cause of disease in pigs in China, Australia, and the United Kingdom.
There are little data on morbidity and mortality associated with PSV. Experimental inoculation of gilts with PSV on day 30 of gestation resulted in 94.4 percent fetal mortality in one study.

Transmission
------------
Fecal-oral is the primary mode of transmission. Fomites may play a role in the transmission.

Infection in swine/pathogenesis
-------------------------------
PSV infections are often subclinical though the virus can cause neurologic disorders, diarrhea, and pneumonia. The term SMEDI syndrome (stillbirth [S], mummified fetus [M], embryonic death [ED], infertility [I]) is used to describe the variety of reproductive disorders caused by PSV and other picornaviruses.

Diagnosis
---------
PSV can be cultured and identified by virus neutralization or immunofluorescence assays.
Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is most commonly used to detect PSV in fecal samples and can distinguish between PSV, porcine teschovirus (PTV), and enterovirus-G (EV-G).

Immunity
--------
Maternal antibody is not protective against transplacental infection, although colostral antibody may be.
There is no vaccine for PSV-1.

[According to the official report of the case presentation (available at http://www.swinehealth.org/sapelovirus), "An acute outbreak of atypical neurologic disease in 11-week-old pigs was recently investigated by the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic laboratory (ISUVDL). The farm was located within region 5 according to the Swine Health Information Center emerging disease rapid response regions of the U.S. (http://www.swinehealth.org/). All affected animals originated from a single nursery and were placed in two different finishers at 9 weeks-of-age. Over the following 3 weeks, the clinical onset and progression of signs in affected pigs varied but included decrease of water and feed consumption, compromised ambulation with ataxia, incoordination, mental dullness, paresis, paralysis and decreased response to environmental stimuli. Clinical examination revealed that affected animals had discernible ataxia yet had deep pain perception and withdrawal reflexes in hind limbs. They were able to move their tail and had righting reflex intact. Despite mental dullness and aimless wandering, pigs generally had central awareness with no nystagmus or cranial nerve deficits observed. Overall morbidity of 20% and case fatality rate of 30% was reported by the field veterinarian........

Histopathologic examination of brain revealed severe lymphoplasmacytic and necrotizing encephalomyelitis with multifocal areas of gliosis and neuron satelliosis, suggestive of a neurotropic viral infection. Cultures did not demonstrate bacterial pathogens in multiple tissues from affected pigs. Immunohistochemistry and PCR for PRRS and porcine circovirus were negative. Sections of spinal cord submitted for PCR for enterovirus, teschovirus and sapelovirus were found consistently positive for porcine sapelovirus.

Next Generation Sequencing of brain stem and spinal cord samples investigated the possible presence of other or novel pathogens as well as to confirm previous sapelovirus PCR results. Interestingly, a genetically (perhaps antigenically) novel sapelovirus was identified within CNS tissues of affected animals. The 2,323 amino acid polyprotein sequence has an overall 94% amino acid identity and 86% nucleotide identity to recent Korean sapelovirus (Kyu-Yeol Son, et al. 2014). No other viral agents were identified within examined samples.". - Mod.MPP
