CALL FOR ABSTRACTS AND REGISTRATION
We cordially invite all those interested in emerging infections of humans,
animals or microbes to attend this meeting. I look forward to greeting
each of you personally in September.
Be an ESEI member! If you are applying for a membership now, the annual
membership fee (50 DEM [about $28, as I calculate - Mod.CHC]) will be
subtracted from the conference registration fee, so you should not pay
extra money for the first year.
ESEI is a non-profit international organisation, with independent legal
entity. The purpose of this Society is: to determine which are those
dangerous infections affecting animals and humans that have recently
emerged or appear with new, altered properties (hereinafter: new
infections) and, consequently, have become of primary importance; to
determine in which fields it is possible to support international
co-operation among professionals in different fields allowing for studies
of such new infections, to provide support and assistance to persons or
organisations that pursue notable activities in the investigation of new
infections, with the purpose of indicating possible preventive and curative
measures.
The sphere of activity of the ESEI is: support and co-ordination of studies
and research aimed at the causes and treatment of new, dangerous
infections, provide an exchange forum for scientific knowledge among the
scientists and experts in different countries and support their
co-operation, develop research and teaching programmes and establish other
areas of co-operation at every level of primary and secondary prevention.
