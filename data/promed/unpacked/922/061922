This is in response to your posting from Nick Kelly. There has been an
outbreak of dengue in the southern Caribbean islands, including Barbados.
Trinidad also has had many cases of DHF and several deaths.
Both Trinidad and Barbados this year have seen the return of serotype 2,
while for the past two years serotype 1 had predominated. Both serotypes
are present this year, but CAREC has reported [more isolates of dengue-2
than of dengue-1.
In Barbados, there have been several cases of DHF and at least 2 deaths to
date. We have clearly reached the hyperendemic state, described so clearly
at the [American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene meeting last
week, and in which much of the Caribbean and Central America exists.
The only good news is that the number of laboratory-confirmed cases has
reached a plateau over the past three weeks.

[Thanks to Paul for providing the key information regarding serotype
prevalence. I wonder whether anyone has ever determined the frequency with
which DEN-1 follows DEN-2, DEN-2 follows DEN-1, etc. Might be interesting.
