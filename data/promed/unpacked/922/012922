The Georgia Department of Agriculture has confirmed one positive case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse found in Cook County. This is the 3rd positive case of EEE found in an animal in the South Health District this year [2013].

EEE is the inflammation or swelling of the brain caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus. EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquitoborne diseases in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The EEE virus is transmitted to humans and horses through the bite of an infected mosquito; however, the illness is rare in humans. The EEE virus normally only circulates between birds and mosquitoes in swampy areas. EEE is not transmitted from person to person, horse to horse, or horse to human. While most people bitten by a mosquito carrying EEE will not get sick, those that are infected will generally show symptoms within 3 to 10 days. The symptoms of EEE are sudden onset of fever, muscle pains, and headaches; many will also experience more severe illness that may include seizures and coma. Although most people will not become sick, people are encouraged to take precautions when outdoors. Anyone that is outdoors should do all they can to protect themselves and others from the bites of mosquitoes. Mosquito protection efforts should include the "5 Ds" for prevention:
- Dusk/Dawn: mosquitoes usually bite at dusk and dawn. Limit outdoor activity during those hours;
- Dress: wear light, loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants to reduce the amount of exposed skin;
- DEET: cover exposed skin and clothes with an insect repellent containing the chemical DEET. It is the most effective repellant against mosquito bites;
- Drain: empty any containers (buckets, barrels, kiddie pools) holding standing water to prevent breeding grounds for mosquitoes;
- Doors: make sure doors, windows, and screens are in good condition and fit tightly to keep out mosquitoes.

Horses should be vaccinated against EEE annually at a veterinarian's office.

[The state of Georgia can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/77wD. Cook County in south central Georgia can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/georgia.shtml.

There is a vaccine for horses and it is recommended that it be given every 6 months and preferably every 4 months. The immunity to EEE is shortlived and vaccination must be repeated. Generally EEE vaccine is combined with western equine encephalitis (WEE) vaccine. Some combination vaccines also include West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine. Vaccination is a cheap way to protect your horses.

Horses cannot transmit the disease to humans.
