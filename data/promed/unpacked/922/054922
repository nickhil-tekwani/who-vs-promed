As Ebola reluctantly makes its exit, a new outbreak known as Buruli ulcer has emerged in Bong County [Liberia].

Making the disclosure last Friday [17 Oct 2014] at the regular County Health Team meeting, Dr Azoakoi, the county's health officer explained that Buruli ulcer is a chronic skin and lenient [sic. Perhaps "underlying" or "soft" would be better words. - Mod.SH] tissue infection that causes weakness and can lead to permanent deformity and disability.

According to Dr Azoakoi, children under 15 years are the most susceptible to the disease that leads to the devastation of the skin including the soft tissue with large ulcers on the legs or arms. The disease is caused by infection with _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, an organism belonging to the family of bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy, he told the gathering.

The Buruli ulcer is now prevalent in the Zeanzue Community in Yellequelleh District in Bong County, with more than 25 children already affected since the outbreak some weeks ago, Dr Azoakoi reported, expressing fear for the lives of numerous other children vulnerable to the disease. "Let me make this vivid to you: patients who are [not?] treated initially suffer long-term functional disability," Dr Azoakoi told the gathering.

Buruli ulcer is known in Liberian parlance as "be serious" because it is very stubborn to heal and therefore requires meticulous treatment. Therefore, to overcome the skin disease, one must "be serious" about it. He mentioned that if nothing is done to contain the disease, the likelihood of many children in the community being direct victims is eminent. According to him, some of the children of one parent have refused to eat with their siblings who are suffering from the disease for fear of also becoming infected.

Commenting on the signs and symptoms, the county health officer explained that the disease starts as a painless swelling of the legs, arms, or face and without treatment within 4 weeks, the disease undermines the bone, causing deformities.

The disease can be treated if the [infection] is detected early.

Dr Azoakoi recommended that health education at the village and community levels, training of health workers and volunteers, strengthening of health facilities with essential drugs and equipment will help to prevent the further spread of the disease.

"Since there is no adequate information of how the Buruli ulcer or tropical ulcer is communicated [transmitted], preventive actions cannot be applied but it is vital to minimize the suffering and disabilities of the children," the health officer advised. He said the actual cause of the ulcer has not been established, either by medical institutions in the county or the County Health Team. He did tell the Daily Observer, however, that there has been no report of death from the Buruli ulcer since the outbreak began some weeks ago.

[The following has been extracted from World Health Organization Buruli ulcer fact sheet no 199 (updated July 2014), available at http://www.who.int/entity/mediacentre/factsheets/fs199/en/index.html:

Buruli ulcer is a chronic debilitating skin and soft tissue infection with large ulcers usually on the legs or arms that can lead to bone infection and permanent disfigurement and disability. It initially presents as a nodule or large painless area of induration or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face.

It is caused by _Mycobacterium ulcerans_, which needs a temperature between 29-33 deg C [84.2-91.4] and a low (2.5 per cent) oxygen concentration to grow in vitro. The organism produces a unique toxin -- mycolactone, which causes tissue damage and inhibits the immune response. Local immunosuppressive properties of the mycolactone toxin enable the disease to progress with no pain and fever. The diagnosis can be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology, and culture.

Buruli ulcer has been reported in over 30 countries usually with subtropical and temperate climates in Africa, South America, Asia, and Western Pacific regions. Countries in West and Central Africa -- Benin, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana -- report the majority of cases. In Africa, about 48 per cent of those affected are children under 15 years, whereas in Australia, 10 per cent are children under 15 years; and in Japan, 19 per cent are children under 15 years. 80 per cent of cases detected early can be cured with a combination of antibiotics; however, late diagnosis can result in long and costly hospitalizations with significant morbidity and disability.

Different combinations of antibiotics given for 8 weeks are used to treat the Buruli ulcer irrespective of the stage. Medical treatment is rifampin, combined with either streptomycin or clarithromycin, for 8 weeks, in addition to surgical wound management. Rifampin combined with moxifloxacin has also been used.

Buruli ulcer is named after a county in Uganda. Although the exact mode of transmission of _M. ulcerans_ is still unknown, _M. ulcerans_ is thought to be acquired from the environment, and this organism has been found in the feces of possums in Buruli ulcer-endemic areas of Victoria, Australia (ProMED-mail post Buruli ulcer - Australia: (VI) M. ulcerans, possum feces 20140913.2771412), where mosquitoes may be vectors (Lavender CJ, Fyfe JA, Azuolas J, et al: Risk of Buruli ulcer and detection of _Mycobacterium ulcerans_ in mosquitoes in south eastern Australia. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2011; 5(9): e1305. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001305. Epub 2011 Sep 20).

Bong, with a population of 328 919, is one of 15 counties of the West African nation of Liberia and Bong County is located in the north-central portion of the country (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bong_County). Yeallequellah (with a population of 36 919) is one of 12 districts in Bong County.
