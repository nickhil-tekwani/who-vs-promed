Imported human outbreak of trichinellosis, Italy
------------------------------------------
On 6 Jan 2001, 7 immigrants from an eastern European country living in Rome
(Italy) received a gift package of smoked pork sausages from their
relations. On 10 January, they ate different amounts of sausages. One of
the immigrants, who worked for an Italian family, gave them as a gift to
her employers. Only 2 of the employers tasted the sausages, eating about
10g each.
Two days [later, 6 of the immigrants [suffered diarrhea and vomiting
lasting 1 day. Starting from 1 February (3 weeks after the ingestion of the
infected meal), 7 immigrants aged 19 to 55 years (average 33 years; 4
males) were admitted as inpatients to the L. Spallanzani hospital for
infectious diseases in Rome. All had fever (38°-39°C), myalgia, and
abdominal pain, and 6 of the 7 had diarrhea and periorbital edema.
Trichinella infection was diagnosed serologically at the International
Trichinella Reference Center of the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (Rome). An
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay showed specific anti-trichinella IgG with
titers higher than 1:800 in the 4 patients with the most severe symptoms.
Eosinophilia was detected in all 7 patients. Muscular enzyme levels were
slightly elevated or normal: LDH and CK (creatine kinase) were elevated.
All 7 persons were treated with albendazole (400mg orally for 14 days) and
an anti-inflammatory therapy (methylprednisolone 20mg daily for 3 days) and
responded promptly.
One of the 2 members of the Italian family who had eaten a small piece of a
sausage showed a seroconversion [titer 1:400, 50 days after eating the
infected meat.
This incident is similar to [one that occurred in London among immigrants
of another eastern European country following the consumption of infected
sausages imported from their country of origin in December 1999. This
outbreak of human trichinellosis is the second one documented to have
occurred in Rome. The first one occurred among 109 people following the
consumption of a local pig in 1948.

[Trichinellosis is a parasitic zoonosis present worldwide. It is mainly
associated with the consumption of infected pork, horse meat, or game. When
a host ingests raw meat infected with trichinella larvae, within 5 or 6
days the larvae develop into adults in the gut of the host. Females then
produce newborn larvae, some of which, after passing through the lymphatic
and blood vessels of the host, reach muscle cells. In 2-3 weeks, the larvae
become infective and the host cell develops into a nurse cell, in some
cases allowing infective larvae to survive for years.
In the past decade, a breakdown of government veterinary services and state
farms and economic problems in central and eastern Europe resulted in a
sharp increase of trichinella infection in swine herds, with a prevalence
of up to 50 per cent in some villages and several thousand infections in
humans.
This imported sausage could just as easily have been infected with
classical swine fever or foot and mouth disease virus or even African swine
fever. Any of these diseases could have been transmitted to animals if the
sausage had been fed to the animals. This illustrates how easily diseased
products enter almost any country. ­ Mod.TG
