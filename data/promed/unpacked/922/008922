Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 15
-----------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 29 May 2006, the Ministry of Health in Indonesia has
confirmed an additional 6 cases of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus. Three of these cases were fatal. None of the
newly confirmed cases is associated with the family cluster in Karo,
North Sumatra. The cases are widely dispersed geographically. [Maps
showing the location of Indonesia's H5N1 cases can be found on the
WHO Indonesia avian influenza web site at
<http://www.who.or.id/eng/php/index.php>. - Mod.CP]
One newly confirmed case is an 18-year-old man from East Java
Province. He developed symptoms on 6 May and was hospitalized on 17
May. He is now recovering. The investigation found a history of
exposure to dead chickens in his home within the week prior to
symptom onset. No further cases of influenza-like illness have been
identified during the investigation and monitoring of his close
contacts.
Two additional cases occurred in a 10-year-old girl and her
18-year-old brother from Bandung, West Java. Both children developed
symptoms on 16 May, were hospitalized on 22 May, and died on 23 May.
Both children had a history of close contact with sick and dying
chickens at their home in the week before symptom onset. The
identical onset dates strongly suggest that they acquired their
infection following a shared exposure to poultry, and not from each
other. Follow-up of contacts has not identified further cases of
influenza-like illness.
An additional case occurred in a 39-year-old man from West Jakarta.
He developed symptoms on 9 May, was hospitalized on 16 May, and died
on 19 May. The investigation determined that the man cleaned pigeon
faeces from blocked roof gutters at his home shortly before symptom
onset. No further potential source of exposure was identified.
The remaining 2 patients are a 43-year-old man from South Jakarta,
who developed symptoms on 6 May, and a 15-year-old girl from West
Sumatra, who developed symptoms on 17 May. The 43-year-old man has
recovered and been discharged from hospital. The 15-year-old girl
remains hospitalized. The sources of exposure for these 2 cases are
under investigation.
The newly confirmed cases bring the cumulative total in Indonesia to
48. Of these cases, 36 were fatal.

[Of these 6 additional confirmed human cases of H5N1 influenza virus
infection described above, 4 are not linked with previous cases. The
remaining 2 are siblings from Bandung with identical dates of onset
and likely to have been infected from a common source rather than
indicative of person-to-person transmission of infection. These
observations are not consistent with evolution of the virus towards a
form capable of person-to-person transmission. On the other hand the
WHO maps referenced above indicate that although outbreaks of animal
disease have occurred widely throughout the archipelago, so far human
cases has occurred predominantly in the central region and in
northern Sumatra. The northern Sumatra cluster is geographically
detached from the main body of human cases and conceivably might be
associated with an atypical virus. - Mod.CP]
