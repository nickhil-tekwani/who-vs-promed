Monrovia
--------
The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare [MOHSW] will provide official public notice of the outbreak in [the capital] Monrovia on key radio stations today [13 Jun 2014], and over 1000 posters were delivered to the Montserrado CHT today to support the meeting and sensitization.

Five confirmed new cases of EVD were recorded: 2 in Foya, Lofa County and 3 in Monrovia, Montserrado.

On Fri 13 Jun 2014, The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) convened an emergency meeting to discuss confirmation of EVD cases and deaths in New Kru Town community of Monrovia, Montserrado County. In response to the presence of the disease in Monrovia, the MOHSW has reactivated the ambulance team, a burial team, and are reactivating an alert team.

The total number of suspected, probable, and confirmed EVD cases reported in Liberia since the onset of the EVD outbreak is 28 including: 7 suspected; 5 probable; and 16 confirmed. The total number of EVD related deaths now stands at 16 including: 9 confirmed; 5 probable; and 2 suspected. Results were received yesterday [12 Jun 2014] for 7 tested specimens: 4 are confirmed positive and 3 negative.

Six new contacts have been established from confirmed cases. New admission into treatment units remains now 9 with one in Monrovia, Montserrado County and 8 in Foya, Lofa County.

The MOHSW and partners remain heavily engaged on EVD response activities at the Liberia-Guinea border in Lofa County, with particular focus on Foya District.

UNICEF delivered 3500 posters to MOHSW yesterday [12 Jun 2014], and 14 mobilization teams will increase mobilization in all key towns along the border in Lofa beginning Mon 16 Jun 2014. UNICEF's current estimated funding requirement for EVD-related C4D, Health and WASH interventions remains approximately USD 500 000. As of now, the County Office has received USD 313 000 from various donors. The funding gap as of today [13 Jun 2014] is USD 187 000. The County Office will, however, revise funding requirements based on the recent increase and spread of EVD.

Situation overview
------------------
Based on field investigation to date, a woman from Sierra Leone travelled through Foya, Lofa County to her family in New Kru Town (late May/early June 2014). She was sick on arrival, died and was buried in Liberia. Following this, a sick child relative of the woman also died and was buried in Liberia. On Wed 11 Jun 2014, 4 persons (caretakers of the woman and child) in the New Kru Town household were sick. One was carried to a church for care (St. Moses) and died. The body was transported by taxi and wheelbarrow. Another died at the house in New Kru Town.

The field investigation team met the family and was able to collect a specimen from the recently deceased for lab testing.

Two caregivers of the deceased have since reported sick, one male and one female. The male died in transport to ELWA Hospital. The female is currently under treatment at ELWA Hospital. Specimens were collected from both. Three specimens collected from the 2 deceased and the one patient at ELWA hospital were found positive for ebolavirus. 12 contacts have been traced so far.

A cook shop is operated from the house in New Kru Town where people have died, and the need for intensified contact tracing is noted as critical.

The death toll from ebolavirus disease on 13 Jun 2014 is 236 confirmed cases, including 144 deaths, said the Guinean minister of health, Remy Lamah, on Saturday [14 Jun 2014].

To date, 34 patients remain hospitalized in different treatment centers in the country, including 15 in Guekedou (epicenter of the disease in the south), 8 in Telmele, 2 in Boffa and 9 in Conakry, the capital. Personnel and logistics have been sent to the main centers of the epidemic to break the chain of transmission, said Dr Lamah.

Through follow up of patients by medical teams of Guinean doctors and experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), 64 people have been found to be completely healed.

The Guinean minister reiterated the ban on transport of corpses of people who have died from EVD from one prefecture to another or one place to another. At present, the rate of follow up of contacts identified in the country is 98 per cent for the Guekedou prefecture, 100 per cent for Macenta, and about 68 per cent for Conakry, said the minister of health.

Sierra Leone raised its death toll from ebolavirus disease (EVD) on Thursday [12 Jun 2014] to 17, announcing 5 new deaths over the previous 48 hours [now 19 deaths, see [4] below].

A pregnant women identified as the 1st person to be cured of the deadly ebolavirus in Sierra Leone has spoken of her joy at her "miracle" recovery. She was discharged from hospital in the eastern city of Kenema on Sunday [8 Jun 2014] after hovering for weeks between life and death battling the tropical disease, which has killed more than 200 people since an outbreak in neighbouring Guinea. "I am thankful to God to have survived the ordeal. I can hardly say more, I am overjoyed," she told the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation on Friday [13 Jun 2014].

Health officials in Kenema, 320 km from the west African nation's capital, Freetown, say no other Sierra Leonean had been given the all-clear before her recovery, although 3 more unnamed survivors have since been announced. "[She] was among 46 people tested and confirmed as having EVD. She tested positive 3 times, 3 weeks ago," district medical officer Mohamed Vandi told the [broadcasting] station. Crowds gathered outside the broadcaster's headquarters in Kenema as she was interviewed, with well-wishers chanting that she was the "miracle woman of the year". "We are thankful that we didn't lose her. The family is grateful to God and to all others that fought to save her life," her husband said.

Ebolaviruses can fell victims within days, causing severe fever, muscle pain, weakness, vomiting and diarrhoea, and in some cases shutting down organs and causing unstoppable bleeding. No medicine or vaccine exists for the disease, [but] medical aid organisation Medecins sans Frontieres [MSF; doctors without borders] says the chances of surviving are greatly improved if patients are kept hydrated and receive treatment for secondary infections. The woman has not revealed her age or the date her baby is due, but she is thought to be in her 30s. A doctor at the hospital who asked not to be named said her survival was down to a combination of a strong immune system and excellent care.

[The virus is spreading through unrecognized cases travelling between countries. This is the risk for intercontinental spread if an ebolavirus case should arrive at a hospital where the treating physician has not heard of the EVD epidemic in West Africa. This is what actually happened when a doctor in Gabon, who had not heard of an EVD epidemic in his own country, unsuspectingly treated 2 cases arriving from the epidemic area and became sick himself. He flew to South Africa for treatment (none of his co-travellers on the flight became infected), but the nurse who treated him died, and he survived to go home.

A travel history should always be taken for any patient admitted with a high fever. There is always an increased risk when a case reaches a capital city with an international airport, as is now the case for Monrovia, Freetown in Sierra Leone, and Conakry in Guinea. - Mod.JW
