[Prof. Hal Nash became interested in the possible links between
infection & chronic disease, partly through reading ProMED-mail.
We commissioned him to provide a summary of the current state of
knowledge, which will be posted in several parts, all with titles
beginning:

Borna virus and mental illness
------------------------------------
Perhaps as challenging to organic disease dogma as were _H. pylori_
and _C. pneumoniae_ is Borna disease virus and its suspected role in
causing mood disorders and schizophrenia.
The virus was initially isolated from a variety of domestic and wild
animals, mostly mammals but also ostriches. A wide variety of
behavioral, mental, and motor symptoms have been observed.
Typically, the virus targets peripheral neurons and spreads toward
the central nervous system. In animal studies, the virus targets the
limbic system and hypothalamus.

In humans, recent data revealed the presence of genetic traces of
the borna virus in the blood of a schizophrenic patient. Researchers
cautioned that borna virus in the blood does not prove that the virus
causes psychiatric symptoms.
Also, borna virus was recently isolated from monocytes from patients
with mood disorders. Viral markers coincided with acute episodes of
mood disorders. The researchers proposed that such findings might
pave the way for new treatment strategies should evidence continue to
mount supporting borna virus as a contributor to at least some mental
illness.
