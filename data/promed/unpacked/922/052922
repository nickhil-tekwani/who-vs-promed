Health Ministry warns on Marburg outbreak
------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health has warned the general public of an outbreak of the deadly Marburg virus in Kitumba sub-county, Kabale district in western Uganda. A statement issued Friday [19 Oct 2012] afternoon said laboratory tests done at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed 3 samples positive for the highly infectious viral hemorrhagic fever. Preliminary reports from the district indicate that 4 other people had allegedly died of a strange disease since [4 Oct 2012]. This strange disease has now been confirmed as Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Investigations indicate that all the cases occurred among members of the same family in Kiyonjo parish in Kitumba sub-county.

Marburg hemorrhaagic fever is a killer disease caused by a virus and is spread through direct contact with wounds, body fluids like blood, saliva, vomitus, stool and urine of an infected person. A person suffering from Marburg virus disease presents with sudden onset of high fever with any of the following; headache, vomiting blood, joint and muscle pains and bleeding through the body openings, i.e. eyes, nose, gums, ears, anus and the skin.

Marburg is a highly contagious disease and kills in a short time but can easily be prevented [?}. The Ministry of Health is working with stakeholders and other development partners to contain the spread of this disease. The following measures have been put in place in order to limit the spread of this highly infectious disease;

- A team of experts has been dispatched to the district to support both clinical and public health investigations
- The National Taskforce has reactivated its rapid response committees to quickly act to any emergencies
- The surveillance team has commenced the active tracing and listing of all possible contacts that were exposed to the suspects and confirmed cases.
- The Kabale District Taskforce has been reactivated to effectively coordinate programs in the district

The Ministry of Health urges the general public to observe the following protective measures;

- Report any suspected patient to a nearby health unit
- Avoid direct contact with body fluids of a person suffering from Marburg by using protective materials like gloves and masks
- Avoid unnecessary public gatherings

The Ministry of Health calls upon the public to stay calm as all possible measures are being undertaken to control the situation. For more information and reports of any cases, please contact the Ministry hotline on +256750996034. The country will be kept informed further on the outcome of this health emergency.

[The 1st outbreak of this disease occurred in Marburg, Germany, and Belgrade, former Yugoslavia, in 1967 leading to the initial recognition of this disease. The outbreak was associated laboratory work using African green monkeys (_Cercopithecus aethiops_) imported from Uganda. Subsequently, outbreaks and sporadic cases have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa (in a person with a recent travel history to Zimbabwe) and Uganda. The most recent outbreak in Uganda occurred in 2007, and this new outbreak follows closely on an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever caused by Ebola virus, another filovirus, in Kibale district, recently declared over by the Ugandan Ministry of Health and WHO.

Neither disease has a vaccine or specific treatment. Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoir of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that bats are involved, but much work remains to be done to definitively describe the the natural transmission cycle. Monkeys are susceptible to infection but are not considered plausible reservoir hosts as virtually all infected animals die too rapidly to sustain survival of the virus. Infection of humans occurs sporadically. Information on the characteristics and treatment of Marburg fever can be obtained at: http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs_marburg/en/index.html.

Kabale District is bordered by Rukungiri District to the north, Ntungamo District to the northeast, the Republic of Rwanda to the east and south, Kisoro District to the west and Kanungu District to the northwest. The town of Kabale, where the district headquarters are located, lies approximately 420 kilometres (260 mi), by road, southwest of Kampala, the capital city of Uganda.
