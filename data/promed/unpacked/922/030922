The outbreak of anthrax in the country is a threat to the growth of the
livestock sub-sector, findings by the Kenya Livestock Marketing Council
(KLMC) reveal.
Research conducted by the council disclosed that the prevalence of
livestock diseases, especially anthrax, in livestock rearing regions is
likely to dent Kenya's hope of capturing the lucrative European Union and
Gulf states markets.
Abass Mohammed, the chief executive officer of KLMC, expressed fears that
poor sanitary conditions may derail the sector from its growth path at a
time when the international market is showing interest for Kenya's beef.
"Kenya's access to lucrative international markets has been slowed by
disease outbreaks," Mohammed told The Standard on Sunday. "Our relaxed
disease surveillance mechanism appears to be our biggest let-down, as the
international market needs the assurance that beef coming from Kenya is
disease-free."
He said Mauritius, Kenya's largest export market, has begun to show jitters
following the recent outbreak of the highly infectious anthrax disease in
Maragua, Samburu and Nairobi. During 2005, the industry exported 7000 head
of cattle to Mauritius after a 5-year lull, earning the country Sh140
million [USD 1.95 million] in foreign exchange. There has also been renewed
interest for Kenya's beef from the Gulf nations, who slapped a ban on
Kenya's beef after an outbreak of foot and mouth disease at a Taita Taveta
ranch which used to fatten animals destined for the export market.
However, players in the industry warn that growth of the industry is likely
to be subdued by the poor veterinary services, which they blame on the
minimal support the sector gets from the Government. The sector has been
thrown into disarray due to lack of Government support. Countries such as
Botswana, which learnt a lot from Kenya, have made great strides, said
Mohammed.
Botswana earns more from livestock than what Kenya gets from tea exports
yet it holds 1/3 of Kenya's livestock, according to the Institute of Policy
Analysis and Research (IPAR). Botswana, adds IPAR, has not reported a
single case of anthrax, foot and mouth or rinderpest over the past decade.
Animal health service delivery has been cited in the study as the major
obstacle in reviving the industry.
In the early 1990s, the [Kenya] Veterinary department bore the brunt of
civil service reforms that saw it loose a huge chunk of its workforce,
forcing it to operate with a skeleton staff.
Following the collapse of Kenya Meat Commission, which was a major outlet
for livestock products, due to institutional and financial problems,
livestock farmers have been made to contend with a diminished market. The
sub-sector contributes 10 per cent of the national Gross Domestic Product.
However, according to Mohammed, less than one per cent of the country's GDP
is invested in the sub sector. "The expansive North Eastern province which
holds over 40 per cent of the country's livestock has fewer than 10
veterinary doctors," Mohammed said.

This setback for the Kenya Livestock Marketing Council is an illustration
that the cost of animal diseases goes beyond the losses incurred by
farmers. The costs of an animal disease can affect a country as a whole. It
is also an example of how commonly used methods (tallies) for determining
the cost of animal disease outbreaks can underestimate the much greater
indirect costs resulting from loss of trade. Trade is an important
value-added contribution to a country's exports from livestock and
livestock production and particularly valuable to low-income countries.
