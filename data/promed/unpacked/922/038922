Abstract:
"African swine fever (ASF) is one of the most important and deadly infectious diseases of domestic and wild pigs. It is caused by a single virus of the genus _Asfarvirus_ belonging to Asfarviridae family. The disease is characterized by high mortality of nearly 100 percent. It has either been identified or suspected in some areas of Africa, namely southern Senegal, Guinea Bissau, Cape Verde, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, Angola and Mozambique.

In Chad, the pig is essentially in the hands of small farmers who practice traditional ways (free-living hosts). Since 2010, the pig population of Chad has experienced a death rate of nearly 60-80 [percent] due to African swine fever. African swine fever appeared in the country for the 1st time in October 2010 in the city of Bongor, capital of Mayo-Kebbi-East Region, which is located about 250 km [155 miles] from N'Djamena.

This city shares a border with North Cameroon, where the disease was reported in May 2010. Despite the steps taken by the veterinary services of Chad, the disease was reported 5 months [later] in the country, and in less than 4 months, it affected 5 regions, namely Mayo-Kebbi-East, Mayo-Kebbi-West, Tandjile, Western Logone and Chari-Baguirmi.

Given the role of soft ticks in the epidemiology of African swine fever in some countries, the aim of this study is to identify the factors that contributed to the introduction and spread of ASF virus Chad in order to clarify the epidemiology of the disease in this country. Administrative documents (Decrees and Acts) constituted the basis of this study. The study showed that the role of wild pigs and soft ticks in this 1st introduction of ASF virus in Chad appeared to be unlikely. It showed that the contamination of the country by ASF virus would be exogenous. Movements of animals within and across the border of the country, the delay in compensation for pig producers, the low rate of compensation for producers, and ignorance by pig producers about the disease, coupled sanitary measures and socio-cultural practices have contributed to the introduction and spread of ASF virus in Chad." - Mod.CRD
