At least 10 persons have died of a mysterious disease within a span
of 8 days near Bondamunda, about 10 km from here, triggering panic
among local people.

15 other patients from the area who complained of mild fever, severe
headache and vomiting are being treated in several hospitals of the
district, doctors said, adding that efforts are on to identify the
disease.

The mystery disease had claimed 6 lives last week, while 4 people
died yesterday [1 Aug 2008] in the Tilikanagar slum area near here.

Assistant District Medical Officer R N Das told PTI that a team of
doctors was rushed to the affected area this morning [2 Aug 2008]
with medicines.

Residents of the slum area accused the Rourkela Municipality of
ignoring the locals.

[The symptom complex of "mild fever, severe headache, and vomiting"
is significantly broad and vague that narrowing down a differential
diagnosis list is a challenge. Fever, headache and vomiting can be
related to a neurologic infection such as Japanese encephalitis or
henipavirus; it can be related to a gastrointestinal infection (such
as cholera, although the presence of fever is unusual); it can be
related to a systemic infection such as malaria or leptospirosis, all
of which are possible diagnoses in Orissa India.

ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more information on
these as yet undiagnosed deaths from knowledgeable sources in the
region.

Orissa, near the border with Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh states.
