The Tulsa Health Department (THD and the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH) announced they are notifying approximately 7000 patients of a local dental practice about potential exposure to blood borne viruses following a joint investigation with the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry (OBD). The investigation revealed practices that could have exposed patients to infectious material.

According to the OSD, the investigation of the practice of W. Scott Harrington, D.M.D. so far has found numerous violations of health and safety laws and major violations of the State Dental Act. Dental Board investigators have been assisted by agents from the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and the United States Drug Enforcement Administration concerning the maintenance, control and use of drugs on the premises. The dentist and dental office voluntarily discontinued practicing upon the beginning of the investigation. The dentist is cooperating with investigators through his attorney. The State Board of Dentistry has been working very closely with the State Health Department on this investigation. The investigation is multifaceted and ongoing.

Patients who had procedures at Dr. W. Scott Harrington's dental practice, located at 2111 S. Atlanta Place in Tulsa or at 12806 E. 86th Place N. in Owasso, Oklahoma, will begin to receive letters in the mail. The notification includes patients who have visited Dr. Harrington since 2007 and recommends they be tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV are serious medical conditions, and infected patients may not have outward symptoms of these diseases for many years. As a precaution, and in order to take appropriate steps to protect their health, it is important for these patients to get tested. It should be noted that transmission in this type of occupational setting is rare.

All testing will be done free of charge at the Tulsa Health Department's North Regional Health and Wellness Center located at 5635 N. Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Services will be provided on a walk-in basis starting on Sat 30 Mar 2013 from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and will resume on Mon 1 Apr 2013 from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. In addition, the health department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions about this notification or hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV. Patient information was only available from the past 7 years; therefore, patients who were seen by Dr. Harrington prior to 2007 may not receive a letter. Anyone with additional questions may call the hotline.

The Tulsa Health Department will continue to provide updated information on their website at http://www.tulsa-health.org.

The Tulsa Health Department is warning 7000 patients of a local dentist's office that they could have contracted HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C from poor sterilization practices. Dr. Wayne Harrington, an oral surgeon with a practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is being investigated by the state dental board, the state bureau of narcotics and the federal Drug Enforcement Agency because one of his patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than receiving dental treatment.

Upon hearing of the infected patient, the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry conducted a surprise inspection of Harrington's practice on 18 Mar 2013, allegedly finding numerous problems, including regular use of a rusty set of instruments on patients with known infections, and the practice of pouring bleach on wounds until they "turned white."

Calls to Harrington's office were directed to an operator, who told ABC News the clinic no longer took voice-mails. The operator said patients were being referred to another clinic but did not disclose the clinic's name.

Susan Rogers, executive director of Oklahoma's Board of Dentistry, called the incident a "perfect storm." On top of his many violations in sanitary practice, the dentist was a Medicaid provider, which means he had a high proportion of patients with HIV or hepatitis, she said. Harrington and his staff told investigators that he treated a "high population of known infectious disease carrier patients," according to a complaint filed by the Oklahoma Board of Dentistry. He allegedly allowed unlicensed dental assistants to administer medication, according to the complaint. These assistants were left to decide which medications to administer and how much was appropriate. Drug cabinets were unlocked and unsupervised during the day, and Harrington did not keep an inventory log of drugs, some of which were controlled substances. One drug vial had expired in 1993.

"During the inspections, Dr. Harrington referred to his staff regarding all sterilization and drug procedures in his office," the complaint read. "He advised, 'They take care of that. I don't.'"

Harrington allegedly re-used needles, contaminating drugs with potentially harmful bacteria and trace amounts of other drugs, according to the complaint. Although patient-specific drug records indicated that they were using morphine in 2012, no morphine had been ordered since 2009. The instruments for infected patients were given an extra dip in bleach in addition to normal cleaning methods, but they had red-brown rust spots, indicating that they were "porous and cannot be properly sterilized," according to the complaint.

The Tulsa Health Department said Harrington's patients will receive letters by mail notifying them of the risk and steps to obtain free-of-charge testing. While 7000 patients may have been exposed, Joseph Perz, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it's "extremely rare" to see dental transmission of HIV and hepatitis B or C. In July 2012, 8000 persons in Colorado were notified that their dentist had reused needles, potentially exposing them to the blood-borne viruses. But not a single case was identified, according to the CDC. Dental transmission is not impossible, however. Perz cited a dental fair 3 years ago in which hepatitis B was transmitted between patients. In July 2012, more than 1800 veterans who received dental care at a St. Louis VA Medical Center were warned that improper cleaning of dental tools may have exposed them to HIV and hepatitis.

The Tulsa Health Department has set up a hotline at (918) 595-4500 for people with questions.

[Some 7000 patients who since 2007 received treatment at a dental practice in Tulsa, Oklahoma will begin to receive letters recommending that they be tested for the presence of the blood-borne pathogens hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV are serious infections, and patients may not have outward symptoms of these diseases for many years.

The Dental Practice in Tulsa is presently being investigated for serious breaches of normal surgical and dental procedures over a considerable period of time. There is no direct evidence so far that any of the patients attending this clinic has contracted a blood-borne infection; however, the risk is real. The investigation of the dental clinic was initiated because one of the dentist's patients recently tested positive for hepatitis C and HIV without known risk factors other than receiving dental treatment.

Tulsa is the 2nd-largest city in the U.S. state of Oklahoma and the 45th-largest city in the United States. With a population of 391 906 as of the 2010 census, it is the principal municipality of the Tulsa Metropolitan Area.
