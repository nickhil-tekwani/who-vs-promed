Rabies claims first victim in 11 years
----------------------------------
A domestic helper died from rabies yesterday, the first recorded fatality
from the disease in 11 years. The 22-year-old woman was admitted to Tuen Mun
Hospital after developing symptoms last Saturday. She was transferred to
Princess Margaret Hospital yesterday morning and died in the afternoon.
Doctors were told that on 15 May 1999 the woman had been bitten on her leg
by a
stray dog in her home town in the Philippines, a week before her departure
for Hong Kong. She lived with her employers and their 12-year-old son in
Tuen Mun.
The last imported rabies fatality was on 22 Oct 1988, while the last
local case was on 16 Apr 1981.

The case was classified a suspected imported case of human rabies, the
spokesman said. Clinical specimens had been obtained for confirmation of
rabies.
The spokesman said that the woman had no history of dog bite in Hong Kong.
Risk of human-to-human transmission is minimal. Follow-up investigation
showed that the family of three living together with the woman had no
history of contact with the patient's secretion and open wound.
He noted that this was the only suspected rabies case in Hong Kong in recent
years. The last local human case was reported in Hong Kong in 1981, the last
imported human case was reported in 1988 and the last animal case was
reported in 1987.
