Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Coronavirus Testing --- United
States, 2003
CDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) are continuing to investigate
the multicountry outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Infection with a novel coronavirus has been implicated as a possible cause
of SARS (1). This report updates information on U.S. residents with SARS
and summarizes the clinical histories of the 5 U.S. residents identified as
of 9 Apr 2003, who have both suspected SARS and laboratory evidence of
infection with a novel coronavirus.
Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations of SARS are ongoing. CDC's
interim suspected SARS case definition (available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/casedefinition.htm>) continues to be based
on clinical criteria and epidemiologic linkage to other SARS cases or areas
with community transmission of SARS; abnormal radiographic findings are not
required for suspected cases. The WHO case definition for probable SARS
includes radiographic evidence of infiltrates consistent with pneumonia or
respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) on chest radiograph (2). Cases reported
to WHO outside the United States are probable SARS cases; the United States
reports all suspected cases.
As of 9 Apr 2003, a total of 2722 SARS cases have been reported to WHO from
16 countries, including the United States; 106 deaths (case-fatality
proportion: 3.9 percent) have been reported to WHO (3). As of 9 Apr 2003,
CDC had received 166 reports from 30 states of suspected SARS cases among
U.S. residents [see epidemic curve on webpage
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5214a1.htm>]; 135 (81 percent)
cases occurred among adults [see Table of characteristics of cases on
webpage link above]. Of the 166 persons with suspected SARS, 154 (93
percent) had traveled within the 10 days before illness onset to one or
more of the areas listed in the case definition, 9 (5 percent) had
household contact with a person with suspected SARS, and 3 (2 percent) were
health-care workers (HCWs) who had provided medical care to a patient with
suspected SARS. The majority of U.S. patients had normal chest radiographs
[see table on webpage link]. As of 9 Apr 2003, a total of 33 (20 percent)
patients were reported to have pneumonia or RDS. Of the 60 (36 percent)
patients who were hospitalized for greater than 24 hours, 4 (7 percent)
remained hospitalized as of 9 Apr 2003, and no deaths were reported.
Travel Advisories
Travel advisories from WHO and CDC remain in effect. CDC has issued a
travel advisory
(<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/acute_resp_syn_multi.htm>) recommending
that persons planning nonessential or elective travel to mainland China,
Hong Kong, Hanoi, or Singapore consider postponing such travel until
further notice. Persons who have traveled recently to these locations are
urged to seek medical care if they develop fever of greater than 100.4 deg
F (38.0 C), cough, or difficulty breathing within 10 days of travel and to
inform their health-care providers about recent travel to regions where
SARS cases have been reported.
Infection-Control Guidelines
Interim infection-control guidelines for health-care, household, and
community settings will be updated and revised as new information becomes
available. Infection-control practitioners, clinicians providing medical
care for patients with suspected SARS, and persons who might have contact
with persons with suspected SARS should consult these guidelines frequently
to keep current with recommendations
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/sars/index.htm>).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory diagnostic tests used at CDC to test clinical specimens for
evidence of this novel coronavirus are still in development and are not
available outside a research setting. Serologic testing for coronavirus
antibody consists of indirect fluorescent antibody testing and
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that are specific for antibody produced
after infection. Although some patients have detectable coronavirus
antibody within 14 days of illness onset, definitive interpretation of
negative coronavirus antibody tests is possible only for specimens obtained
greater than 21 days after onset of fever. For other suspected SARS cases
in the United States, a second serum specimen collected greater than 21
days after fever onset will be necessary to determine whether infection
with the novel coronavirus can be documented. A reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test specific for RNA from
the novel coronavirus has been positive within the first 10 days after
fever onset in specimens from some SARS patients, but the duration of
detectable viremia or viral shedding is unknown, and RT-PCR tests on
samples collected during convalescence might be negative. Viral culture
followed by RT-PCR also has been used to detect the novel coronavirus in
some specimens.
Case Histories
On 3 Apr 2003, CDC reported to the respective health departments positive
coronavirus test results for 5 persons with SARS. All 5 had pneumonia
requiring hospitalization and had traveled recently to a country in which
community transmission had occurred. The 5 patients did not travel together
or at the same time. Although 2 patients had a common hotel exposure in
Hong Kong, no evidence of a single common exposure for all 5 patients has
been found. Specimens from these 5 patients were among the first tested;
patients were selected on the basis of their clinical and exposure
histories. A description of the exposure and brief clinical history for
each of these 5 SARS patients follows.
Case 1. Patient I is a pregnant woman aged 36 years with a history of
intermittent chronic cough; as of 9 Apr 2003, she was in her 26th week of
pregnancy. During 19 Feb--2 Mar 2003, she traveled to Hong Kong and
Guangdong province in China to visit her family. While in Hong Kong, she
stayed at Hotel M during 19-22 Feb 2003 and again during 24 Feb--2 Mar
2003. The first stay was on the same floor and during the same time as
Patient A (the index case in a large cluster of persons with suspected SARS
described previously) (1). On 8 Feb 2003 [?typographic error - Mod.MPP],
Patient I's intermittent cough resumed. On 24 Feb 2003, she had onset of
fever, chills, and headache. During the next 3 days, her cough progressed,
and she had shortness of breath, myalgia, and blood-streaked sputum. She
sought medical care in Hong Kong and received an antibiotic. Her symptoms
worsened, and on return to the United States on 2 Mar 2003, she was
hospitalized with a diagnosis of pneumonia. On admission, her temperature
was 100.5 F (38.1 C), and rales were noted on chest examination. A chest
radiograph showed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates, and her oxygen
saturation was 93 percent. Laboratory studies on admission included a white
blood cell count (WBC) of 3300/mm3 (12 percent lymphocytes), platelets of
103 000/mm3, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 42 U/L. During the next
3 days, despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, she worsened
clinically with persistent fever and progressive pulmonary infiltrates. On
5 Mar 2003 she had respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation,
and oseltamivir was added to her treatment. She improved gradually during
the next week and was extubated on 12 Mar 2003. On 17 Mar 2003, she was
discharged and was recovering as of 9 Apr 2003. Serologic testing of a
serum specimen collected 12 days after illness onset was positive for
coronavirus antibody. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus is pending.
Case 2. Patient L is a man aged 39 years with a medical history of sleep
apnea and hypothyroidism. He traveled on vacation to Thailand on 23 Feb
2003 and then to Hong Kong on 1 Mar 2003. During 1-6 Mar 2003, he stayed at
Hotel M, at the same time as 3 other suspected SARS patients who were ill
during their hotel stays (1). On 6 Mar 2003, he returned to the United
States. On 13 Mar 2003, he had fever, myalgia, and a mild cough. During the
next 3 days, he had diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis, and shortness of
breath. On 17 Mar 2003, he was hospitalized with pneumonia and a right
upper lobe infiltrate on a chest radiograph. Laboratory studies included a
WBC of 6600/mm3 (50 percent neutrophils and 30 percent lymphocytes) and
platelets of 439 000/mm3. Maximum temperature during hospitalization was
102.4 F (39.1 C). He received broad-spectrum antibiotics but no antiviral
therapy and was discharged on 25 Mar 2003. Serologic testing of a blood
specimen collected 6 days after symptom onset was positive for coronavirus
antibody. RT-PCR testing for human metapneumonia virus was negative. On 19
Mar 2003, his wife, who had traveled with him to Hong Kong, developed
suspected SARS, including pneumonia requiring hospitalization. Her illness
onset occurred 13 days after return from Hong Kong and resulted presumably
from close contact with patient L.
Case 3. Patient X is a woman aged 49 years with a medical history of
chronic sinusitis. She traveled to Hong Kong on business on 2 Mar 2003 and
returned to the United States on 8 Mar 2003. The same day, she had fever,
cough, and shortness of breath for which she sought medical care. She was
given an oral antibiotic. Her symptoms persisted; on 20 Mar 2003, she was
hospitalized with shortness of breath, chest pain, and rigors. On
admission, she had a temperature of 101.4 F (38.6 C), a chest radiograph
showed interstitial infiltrates, and oxygen saturation on room air was 92
percent. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 5100/mm3 (68
percent neutrophils and 28 percent lymphocytes), platelets of 156 000/mm3,
and ALT of 25 U/L. During her hospitalization, she received broad-spectrum
antibiotics and corticosteroids but no antiviral therapy. On 28 Mar 2003,
she was discharged in stable condition. An RT-PCR assay detected the novel
coronavirus on a sputum specimen collected 14 days after illness onset.
RT-PCR testing for human metapneumovirus was negative.
Case 4. Patient Y is a man aged 22 years with no notable medical history.
He traveled to Hong Kong on vacation on 3 Mar 2003 and returned to the
United States on 6 Mar 2003. On 12 Mar 2003, he had onset of fever, chills,
myalgia, headache, and shortness of breath. On 13 Mar 2003, he had a cough
and chest pain and was treated with oral antibiotics. The following day, he
reported to an emergency department (ED) with persistent fever and cough. A
chest radiograph demonstrated a right perihilar infiltrate. He received
intravenous antibiotics in the ED and was discharged the same day on an
oral antibiotic. On 16 Mar 2003, he had worsening shortness of breath and
respiratory distress, and was admitted to a hospital intensive-care unit.
On admission, his temperature was 102.9 F (39.4 C), with an oxygen
saturation of 81 percent on room air. Chest radiograph demonstrated
bilateral infiltrates with pleural effusion. Laboratory studies on
admission included a WBC of 5300/mm3 (82 percent neutrophils and 14 percent
lymphocytes), platelets of 197 000 mm3/mL, and ALT of 74 U/L. He received
broad-spectrum antibiotics and oseltamavir. A direct fluorescent antibody
assay for influenza type A and influenza type B was negative. By 20 Mar
2003, his condition stabilized, and he was discharged on 22 Mar 2003.
Serologic tests of specimens obtained 4, 6, and 13 days after illness onset
were positive for antibody to coronavirus.
Case 5. Patient Z is a woman aged 53 years with no notable medical history.
She traveled to Singapore on 27 Feb 2003 and returned to the United States
on 13 Mar 2003. While in Singapore, she visited hospitals that were
providing care for patients with pneumonia and had close contact with
several persons with probable SARS. She did not use a surgical mask or any
respiratory precautions while in the Singapore hospitals. On 9 Mar 2003,
she had a headache. During 12-15 Mar 2003, she had fever, chills, and
myalgia. On 15 Mar 2003, she was hospitalized with a temperature of 102.7 F
(39.3 C). On admission, a chest radiograph indicated bilateral basilar
atelectasis. Laboratory studies on admission included a WBC of 6500/mm3 (68
percent neutrophils and 19 percent lymphocytes), platelets of 216 000/mm3,
and ALT of 56 U/L. She received broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics but
no antiviral therapy. Her condition stabilized by 12 Mar 2003, and she was
discharged on 26 Mar 2003. Although serologic testing of a specimen
obtained 3 days after fever onset was negative, a second specimen collected
26 days after onset was positive for antibody to coronavirus. RT-PCR
testing for human metapneumovirus is pending.
MMWR Editorial Note:
Evidence of infection with a novel coronavirus has been identified in
patients with suspected SARS in several countries (4--6), including the 5
patients in the United States described in this report. These patients were
among those selected for priority coronavirus testing because of their
specific clinical presentations and exposure histories. All had fever and
respiratory symptoms (e.g., nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and
radiographic evidence of pneumonia). No consistent abnormal laboratory
findings were noted, and the majority were within the normal ranges. Some
laboratory tests that have been reported to be elevated in SARS patients,
such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine phosphokinase (4,6--7), were not
measured for any of these patients. All 5 patients received broad-spectrum
antibiotics appropriate for coverage of typical and atypical respiratory
pathogens. Patients I and Y received oseltamivir, and Patient X received
corticosteroids; no patients received ribavirin. These clinical histories
are similar to those reported from Canada and Hong Kong, but, as of 9 Apr
2003, no initial characteristic signs or symptoms that clearly distinguish
SARS from pneumonia caused by other pathogens have been described (4,6--8).
However, if this novel coronavirus is the cause of SARS in these patients,
the clinical symptoms described in this report most likely do not represent
the full spectrum of illness related to coronavirus infection. Viruses that
cause respiratory illness typically are capable of causing a range of
clinical manifestations, and asymptomatic infections are possible.
State and local health departments are coordinating collection of follow-up
serum specimens from SARS patients whose initial serum specimen might have
been collected too early to indicate serologic evidence of infection. These
results and investigations among well household and other well contacts of
SARS patients (including travelers who were on airline flights with persons
with SARS symptoms) will provide additional information about the spectrum
of illness among patients with SARS and coronavirus infection.
The majority of U.S. residents with SARS, including the 5 persons described
in this report who had evidence of coronavirus infection, have recovered or
stabilized clinically without specific antiviral therapy. The efficacy of
available antiviral therapies against coronavirus infection is unknown.
Ribavirin is a known teratogen, and clinicians who use it should be aware
of all potential adverse events, including severe hemolytic anemia (9).
Preliminary results from in vitro testing indicate that ribavirin
concentrations that inhibit ribavirin-sensitive viruses do not inhibit
replication or cell-to-cell spread of the novel coronavirus (JW Huggins,
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, personal
communication, 2003). However, further in vitro testing of antiviral drugs
on other coronavirus isolates, and more information on the clinical
outcomes of patients treated with ribavirin or other antiviral drugs in
controlled trials is needed.
In several countries, widespread community transmission, as well as
transmission among HCWs, has been observed. As of 9 Apr 2003, no U.S. HCWs
who provided care for the 5 patients with coronavirus infection described
in this report had suspected SARS. Among the close contacts of these 5 SARS
patients, only one (the wife of Patient L) has suspected SARS. The
different transmission patterns observed probably are not attributable to
differences in infection-control practices alone. The inability to predict
which patients are more capable of transmitting the virus that causes SARS
underscores the need to adhere strictly to infection-control
recommendations in both health-care and household settings. Similarly,
close contacts of SARS patients should be vigilant to detect fever or
respiratory symptoms, and persons who develop fever or respiratory symptoms
should seek health-care evaluation.
On 4 Apr 2003, the president of the United States signed an executive order
adding SARS to the list of quarantinable communicable diseases. This act
provides CDC, through its Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, with
the legal authority to implement isolation and quarantine measures as part
of transmissible disease-control measures, if necessary. Isolation refers
to the practice of keeping a patient with a communicable disease separate
from other persons, usually within a health-care facility or at home.
Isolation is used routinely in hospital and health-care settings to reduce
the transmission of infections to uninfected patients. Quarantine refers to
any situation in which a person or group of persons who have been exposed
to a communicable disease and might be infected, but who are not yet ill,
are kept apart from others to prevent disease spread. States generally have
authority to invoke and enforce quarantine within their jurisdictions,
although quarantine laws vary among states. Quarantine is an effective
public health tool. Quarantine in the United States is used primarily to
restrict patients with pulmonary tuberculosis who remain infectious but are
unable or unwilling to remain in settings where they are less likely to
transmit illness. During the previous month, health officials in Singapore,
Hong Kong, and Canada have implemented quarantine and isolation measures to
limit the spread of SARS.
(<http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/04/iraq/20030404-8.html>)
Although evidence is accumulating that a novel coronavirus is the primary
causative agent of SARS, more laboratory and epidemiologic data are needed
before this link is established fully. Once definitive identification of
the cause of SARS has been achieved, an intensive focus on development of
effective treatment regimens might reduce morbidity and mortality of
patients with SARS. However, specific measures to prevent transmission
(e.g., vaccination programs, prophylactic drugs, or hyperimmune globulin)
might require more time to develop and implement. In the interim,
strengthening traditional public health functions such as collection and
rapid analysis of surveillance and epidemiologic data, and implementing
essential infection-control measures for suspected SARS patients and their
contacts, will be the mainstays of SARS control. A sustained and
cooperative global public health response will be necessary to limit
further dissemination of SARS and to prepare for emerging global microbial
threats.

[In today's NY Times, there was a discussion on the classification of local
transmission in the United States, in response to the above information on
3 cases of suspected SARS in healthcare workers exposed to suspected cases
of SARS, and the several household contacts with suspected SARS as
well. In this article
(<http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/10/science/10INFE.html>), "Dr.[James]
Hughes said the reason CDC had not reported that it had local or community
transmission was that it uses a different definition. For CDC, secondary
transmission that occurs in a hospital or household setting where it might
be expected does not constitute community transmission that has to be
reported to WHO." But, in the case of SARS, Dr. Hughes said, "there is
great confusion about what is community transmission versus what is
transmission in recognized settings where transmission typically
occurs. This is an area of inconsistency that needs further discussion."
Because the secondary spread to hospital workers and household members
"represents close contact transmission of patient to health care worker or
ill person to family contact in a household setting," the CDC does not
consider such secondary transmission as community transmission, Dr. Hughes
said. "What is important from a public health perspective is are you having
uncontrolled transmission in a community setting, and that clearly is not
happening in the United States."
Other countries have been reporting local transmission based on contact of
original imported cases beginning with the second generation of cases. In a
press briefing held today
(<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/transcripts/t030410.htm>) there was
additional discussion of this point, as well as mention of a possible
incidence of local transmission in Florida currently under investigation
(see ProMED-mail posting - SARS - worldwide (40):cases) - Mod.MPP]
