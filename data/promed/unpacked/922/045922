[1] Amazon: Spread to Indigenous communities
Date: Sat 25 Jul 2020 13:58 EDT
Source: NY Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/25/world/americas/coronavirus-brazil-amazon.html


The Amazon River is South America's essential life source, a glittering superhighway that cuts through the continent. It is the central artery in a vast network of tributaries that sustains some 30 million people across 8 countries, moving supplies, people and industry deep into forested regions often untouched by road.

But once again, in a painful echo of history, it is also bringing disease. The virus swept through the region like past plagues that have traveled the river with colonizers and corporations.

It spread with the dugout canoes carrying families from town to town, the fishing dinghies with rattling engines, the ferries moving goods for hundreds of miles, packed with passengers sleeping in hammocks, side by side, for days at a time.

As the pandemic assails Brazil, overwhelming it with more than 2 million infections and more than 84 000 deaths -- 2nd only to the United States -- the virus is taking an exceptionally high toll on the Amazon region and the people who have depended on its abundance for generations.

In Brazil, the 6 cities with the highest coronavirus exposure are all on the Amazon River, according to an expansive new study from Brazilian researchers that measured antibodies in the population.

The epidemic has spread so quickly and thoroughly along the river that in remote fishing and farming communities like Tefe, people have been as likely to get the virus as in New York City, home to one of the world's worst outbreaks.

In the past 4 months, as the epidemic traveled from the biggest city in the Brazilian Amazon, Manaus, with its high-rises and factories, to tiny, seemingly isolated villages deep in the interior, the fragile health care system has buckled under the onslaught.

Cities and towns along the river have some of the highest deaths per capita in the country, often several times the national average. In Manaus, there were periods when every Covid ward was full and 100 people were dying a day, pushing the city to cut new burial grounds out of thick forest. Grave diggers lay rows of coffins in long trenches carved in the freshly turned earth.

The virus is exacting an especially high toll on Indigenous people, a parallel to the past. Since the 1500s, waves of explorers have traveled the river, seeking gold, land and converts, and later, rubber, a resource that helped fuel the Industrial Revolution, changing the world. But with them, these outsiders brought violence and diseases like smallpox and measles, killing millions and wiping out entire communities.

Indigenous people have been roughly 6 times as likely to be infected with the coronavirus as white people, according to the Brazilian study, and are dying in far-flung river villages untouched by electricity.

The crisis in the Brazilian Amazon began in Manaus, a city of 2.2 million that has risen out of the forest in a jarring eruption of concrete and glass, tapering at its edges to clusters of wooden homes perched on stilts, high above the water.

Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, is now an industrial powerhouse, a major producer of motorcycles, with many foreign businesses. It is intimately connected to the rest of the world -- its international airport sees about 250 000 passengers a month -- and, through the river, to much of the Amazon region.

Manaus's 1st documented case, confirmed on 13 Mar 2020, came from England. The patient had mild symptoms and quarantined at home, in a wealthier part of town, according to city health officials. Soon, though, the virus seemed to be everywhere.

"We didn't have any more beds, or even armchairs," Dr. Alvaro Queiroz, 26, said of the days when his public hospital in Manaus was completely full. "People never stopped coming."

In Manacapuru, more than an hour from the capital, Messias Nascimento Farias, 40, carried his ailing wife to their car and sped down one of the region's few country roads to meet the ambulance that could carry her to a hospital.

But for most people living along the river, hundreds of boat miles from Manaus, the fastest way to a major hospital is by plane.

Even before the virus arrived, people in far-flung communities with a life-threatening emergency could make a frantic call for an airplane ambulance that would take them to a hospital in the capital. But the small planes turned out to be dangerous for people with Covid-19, sometimes causing blood oxygen levels to plummet as the aircraft rose. Very few of the airlift patients seemed to be surviving, doctors said.

When the coronavirus arrived in the Americas, there was widespread fear that it would take a devastating toll on Indigenous communities across the region. In many places along the Amazon River, those fears appear to be coming true.

At least 570 Indigenous people in Brazil have died of the disease since March 2020, according to an association that represents the country's Indigenous people. The vast majority of those deaths were in places connected to the river.

More than 18 000 Indigenous people have been infected. Community leaders have reported entire villages confined to their hammocks, struggling to rise even to feed their children.

In many instances, the very health workers sent to help them have inadvertently spread the virus.

The pandemic has been brutal on medical workers around the world, and it has been particularly difficult for the doctors and nurses navigating the vast distances, frequent communication cuts, and deep supply scarcity along the Amazon. Without proper training or equipment, many nurses and doctors along the river have died. Others have infected their families.

[Travel along the waterways is a known route for transporting emerging, re-emerging, and exotic pathogens to populations that are traditionally isolated from the more developed regions, and the spread of COVID-19 along the Amazon river is a clear example of this. Take note that spread through this route may already be underway in Africa, as major rivers such as the Nile traverse many countries in that continent. - Mod.UBA]

[2] USA; Increase in cases

California. South Carolina. North Dakota. Kentucky. Hawaii. Those are among the 18 states that set single-day case records in the last week, putting the country on track to breaking a national single-day record for new coronavirus cases set less than 2 weeks ago.

More than 73 500 cases were reported on Friday [24 Jul 2020], according to a New York Times database, approaching the country's record of 75 697 cases, set on 16 Jul 2020. Since 24 Jun 2020, the 7-day average has more than doubled, to more than 66 100 on Fri 24 Jul 2020 from 31 402.

The other states with rapidly growing caseloads are Alabama, Alaska, Indiana, Kansas, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Utah and West Virginia. A 19th state, Louisiana, also set a record, but because it reported a backlog of cases on Monday [20 Jul 2020]. A total of 40 states have seen 14-day increases in cases per capita.

As the number of cases has continued to climb, so has the number of hospitalizations, which dipped briefly below 28 000 in mid-June 2020 but is now skirting its own April 2020 record. Deaths are also rising: Fri 24 Jul 2020 was the 4th consecutive day with more than 1100 reported U.S. deaths, which are trending upward in 30 states. On Sat 25 Jul 2020, South Carolina announced 80 new deaths, a single-day record.

On Fri 24 Jul 2020, the number of people known to be hospitalized with the coronavirus in the country was 59 670, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a few hundred short of the record of 59 940 reported by the database on 15 Apr 2020.

A surge in Starr County, a rural, impoverished area in South Texas, near the border with Mexico, offers a grim example of the type of hospital crisis looming. The county's infection rate of about 2350 per 100 000 people is far higher than in more populous parts of Texas, including Houston. The county's single hospital cannot handle the crush of Covid patients, and ethics committees have been formed to help determine which patients should be treated and which should be sent home to die.

Pentagon officials have dispatched Army and Navy personnel to the Starr County hospital and other medical centers in border cities to provide support, and state and federal officials have sent morgue trailers, ventilators, testing teams and surgical masks to the Rio Grande Valley.

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.UBA]

Highlights
----------
- The COVID-19 pandemic has affected older people disproportionately, especially those living in long-term care facilities. WHO has published a policy brief on preventing and managing COVID-19 across long-term care services.

- Evelyn Narki Dowuona, a health worker at the Ga East Municipal Hospital in Accra, Ghana, speaks with WHO on the challenges of managing COVID-19.

- WHO has released a set of practical steps for implementing the prescriptions of the WHO Manifesto for a healthy recovery from COVID-19. These prescriptions aim to create a healthier, fairer and greener world while investing to maintain and resuscitate the economy hit by the effects of the pandemic.

- Prison nurse Deanna Mezen discusses how life has changed under COVID-19 at one of the largest prisons in the United Kingdom.

- Through the UHC Partnership, WHO has been working since 2011 to support Timor-Leste's efforts to strengthen its health system. At the time of the 1st confirmed case of COVID-19, Timor-Leste had no identified isolation and quarantine facilities, limited surveillance capacity, and had just initiated in-country testing for COVID-19. Swift action from the Ministry of Health decisively transformed its fragile health system and prevented COVID-19 from reaching communities

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 60.0% of the global newly reported cases and 64.9% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 8.2 million cases. The USA reported 42.0% of cases (71 714), Brazil 35.1% (59 961), Mexico 4.9% (8438), Colombia 4.6% (7945), Argentina 3.6% (6127), Peru 2.6% (4546), and Chile 1.5% (2545).

- The European region reported 7.6% of the global newly reported cases and 8.1% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 27.1% (5871) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Spain 10.4% (2255), Kazakhstan 8.0% (1740), Romania 5.1% (1119), Ukraine 5.1% (1106), Turkey 4.3% (937), France 4.2% (931) and the UK 3.5 %(768) Spain's 14-day population-based incidence rate has gone from a low of 7.74 per 100 000 population on 25 Jun 2020 to 37.94 today (25 Jul 2020), continuing to increase on a daily basis (calculated from the daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from https://www.mscbs.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov-China/documentos/Actualizacion_170_COVID-19.pdf) and Italy has increased its 7-day average by 22.2% over the preceding 7-day period, a sign there are increases in transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (calculated from the daily spreadsheet we maintain with data from http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/nuovocoronavirus/dettaglioContenutiNuovoCoronavirus.jsp?lingua=italiano&id=5351&area=nuovoCoronavirus&menu=vuoto).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.9% of the global newly reported cases and 7.1% of global newly reported fatalities. Iran reported 17.7% (2489) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 17.7% (2485), Saudi Arabia 16.9% (2378), Pakistan 10.6% (1487), Oman 8.1% (1145), Kuwait 5.3% (753), Egypt 4.7% (659), Morocco 4.1% (570), Palestinian Authority 3.8% (537), Bahrain 3.3% (462), and Qatar 2.8% (394). Pakistan is decreasing its daily case count steadily during the month of July 2020, while at the same time cases are increasing in Iraq and Oman. This region remains highly active, with multiple countries still in a surge mode.

- The African region reported 7.3% of the global newly reported cases and 5.4% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 67.6% (13 944) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ghana 6.7% (1385), Ethiopia 3.6% (760), Algeria 3.3% (675), Kenya 3.2% (667), and Nigeria 2.8% (591). Since the beginning of July 2020, South Africa has reported daily new case counts of greater than 10 000, 16 of the 25 days.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of the global newly reported cases and 0.25% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 54.7% (2054) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 22.1% (830), Australia 7.7% (289), Singapore 7.4% (277), China 4.3% (160), and South Korea 3.0% (113). Japan has been steadily increasing daily case counts over the past week.

- The South East Asia region reported 18.8% of the global newly reported cases and 14.1% of global deaths. India reported 91.5% (48 916) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 4.7% (2548) and Indonesia 3.3% (1761). India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions.

[Comparing today's numbers with yesterday's (24 Jul 2020), the global case count rose by 1.8% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 50 000. The global tally passed the 16 million mark as predicted in yesterday's post.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported 67 413 cases, followed by Brazil (48 234) and India (48 472). These 3 countries account for almost half of all confirmed cases globally (49.8%). There were 5717 deaths reported in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Brazil, India, South Africa, Mexico, Colombia, Russia, Argentina, Peru, and Iraq, global hotspots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 2712 to 67 413. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, Indonesia, Dominican Republic, Kazakhstan and Romania; their range of reported new cases is 1284 to 2712.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 11.9%, and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 18.4%.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas with cases increasing on a daily basis, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.UBA]
