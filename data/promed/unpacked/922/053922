[With the substantial increase in reports of dengue coming into ProMED, only outbreaks of 50 or more cases will be included in the weekly updates. In order to limit posts to key facts, individual reports will give an outbreak's date, total number of dengue cases indicating confirmed cases as (conf.) and unconfirmed cases as (unconf.) if known. DHF cases also include those termed serious cases.

If the numbers of cases are increasing or decreasing, that will be indicated. The dengue virus type is noted if available. The URL of the original report will be given, and the language of the report indicated if it is in other than English. URLs for map locations of the country will be included. - Mod.TY]

At least 124 Cambodian children were killed by dengue fever in the 1st 8 months of this year [2012], a 158 percent rise from only 48 deaths in the same period last year [2011], according to the report of the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control on Saturday [8 Sep 2012].

Some 30 760 dengue fever cases were reported during the January-August period this year [2012], an increase of 179 percent compared with 11 020 cases in the same period last year [2011], the report said.

The province with the highest death toll is Banteay Meanchey with 20 deaths, followed by Siem Reap with 18 deaths and Kampong Cham with 16.

Dr Char Meng Chuor, director of the center, said that among the fatal cases, 70 percent of the patients died of gastrointestinal bleeding.

"There were more deaths this year [2012] because parents had sent their sick children to private clinics first. When the treatment was ineffective and the disease became more severe, they continued to send them to public hospitals, but it was too late for them to be cured," he said.

Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes. The disease of sudden onset usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever, exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, vomiting, and rash.

In Cambodia, the outbreak of dengue fever usually begins at the onset of the rainy season in May and lasts until October.

Char Meng Chuor said that to prevent the outbreak, the center has distributed some 270 tons of Abate (a chemical substance used to kill larvae in water pots) to households this year [2012].

Last year [2011], the country reported 15 980 dengue fever cases, killing 73 children.
