West Nile Virus Infection Confirmed in Horse at Churchill Downs
--------------------------------------------
A thoroughbred that died after becoming ill at Churchill Downs had
contracted West Nile virus, the state veterinarian's office said on Fri 16
Nov 2001.
Rocket Express, a 2-year-old colt, was euthanized at a clinic in Lexington
on 25 Oct 2001. Churchill Downs officials last week announced that West
Nile infection was the preliminary diagnosis.
Rusty Ford, equine programs manager in the state veterinarian's office in
Frankfort, said Rocket Express was one of 8 horses known to have contracted
the virus in Kentucky. Of these, 6 horses died. A ninth horse was diagnosed
in Kentucky but was exposed in Florida. Ford said that horse survived and
is back in Florida.
