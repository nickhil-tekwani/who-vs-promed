Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection kills Native Americans
and Alaskan Natives at 4 times the rate of the rest of the population,
making immunizations critical for native people, say national health
experts. "The virus has hit Indian Country especially hard," said
Kathleen Sebelius, United States Health and Human Services (HSS)
Secretary. Sebelius joined Dr. Yvette Roubideaux, director of Indian
Health Services, and Dr. Ralph Bryan of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), in a teleconference Tuesday [12 Jan
2010] to introduce HHS's new public service announcements. The
announcements, starring Cherokee [Native American] actor Wes Studi,
focus on promoting [pandemic] H1N1 immunization in native populations.

Sebelius said more Native Americans die from [pandemic] H1N1
complications because the population has a higher rate of underlying
health issues, such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease. The health
issues combined with an inability to access health care in remote
reservation communities puts Native Americans at greater risk. But
it's a risk that can be lessened with [pandemic] H1N1 immunizations,
Sebelius said. "It's an essential lifesaving message," she said. "Get
vaccinated now."

Nationwide, 136 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine have been shipped
throughout the country. In the initial stages of immunizations,
vaccines were distributed only to high risk groups such as young
children and pregnant women. All Americans are now eligible for the
free vaccine. More than 60 million people have been vaccinated so far.
H1N1 immunizations are available at all IHS [Indian Health Services]
facilities, as well as at public clinics in most states, Roubideaux
said. With a 3rd wave of the virus expected, the Indian Health
Services, HHS and CDC are warning Native people not to become
complacent in light of the current lull in flu cases.

There have been 23 influenza-related deaths in South Dakota with 6 in
Pennington County, 2 in Shannon and Todd counties and one in Buffalo
County. The state Department of Health calls the current state of flu
activity "sporadic," but that could easily change, Roubideaux said.
"We're concerned that there may be a 3rd wave of [pandemic] H1N1 cases
coming up," Roubideaux said. "I know that getting the vaccine can be
something that people easily put off ... The flu is an unpredictable
disease. We don't know when the 3rd wave will hit. What we do know is
that it's extremely dangerous."

[According to this report, only 60 million of the 136 million doses of
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus vaccine so far available have
been administered, High risk groups such as children and pregnant
women have received most attention. It is clear from this and
preceding ProMED-mail reports that minority ethnic groups are
similarly at increased risk for socio-economic and medical reasons.
The efforts of the relevant authorities (USS and IHS) to increase
vaccine availability for Native American communities in South Dakota
and adjacent states are to be commended.

[On present evidence, the statement in the last line of the report
"What we do know is that it's extremely dangerous" appears to be an
exaggeration. CDC reports that pneumonia & influenza mortality in 122
US cities in 2009 peaked
below the 2007-8 peak, and for the week ending 2 Jan 2010 it has
declined below the epidemic threshold.
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/>
On the other hand, the data in that report show alarge increase in the
number of influenza-associated pediatric deaths nationwide.
