Death Toll from Undiagnosed Fever Reaches 36
--------------------------------------------
SILIGURI: With the death of one more person, the toll in the undiagnosed
fever [outbreak in this commercial town rose to 36. The Deputy Chief
Medical Officer (Health)-II, Dr. Saibal Banerjee, said on Monday that a
70-year old resident of Nagrakata in Jalpaiguri died at the North Bengal
Medical College and Hospital (NBMCH) on Sunday night. Monday 2 more
patients from the Jalpaiguri and Kharibari areas were admitted to the
NBMCH, bringing the total number of patients being treated there to 19. Of
the 19, a total of 9 with acute symptoms of the unknown fever have been
placed in isolation, while the remainder were treated in a separate ward.
Meanwhile, the Union Health Minister, C P Thakur, said in Delhi that the
Centre was planning to seek the help of the United States in identifying
the fever.
He did not rule out the [possibility of the disease originating from
biological warfare. Thakur said that: "Even after 3 weeks, experts so far
are not sure on what kind of a fever it is and what has caused it. If a
diagnosis is not made [soon, the government would send samples of the
cerebrospinal fluid of the patients to the Centers for Disease Control [and
Prevention in Atlanta, [GA, USA."
Experts from the National Institute of Virology in Pune, National Institute
of Communicable Disease and AIIMS in Delhi and the World Health
Organisation (WHO) left the town on Monday after collecting samples. Sinha
said 2 experts, including one from WHO, stayed back for further observation.

Mystery Fever: Japanese Encephalitis Suspected
----------------------------------------------
The outbreak of a mysterious brain disease in north-east India has killed
at least 30 people and created panic among local residents. Officials in
Siliguri, the second largest city in West Bengal, say more than 400 people
have been admitted to hospital.
Although doctors have been unable to identify the mosquito-borne disease,
the symptoms -- high fever, headache and nausea -- resemble those of
Japanese encephalitis. Doctors and nurses have joined those fleeing the
city after some medical personnel died treating patients.
Specialists from India's leading institutes have been flown to Siliguri.
Blood samples have also been sent to laboratories in the United States.
Experts say Siliguri would be prone to an outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis, given the many rice paddies in the area which would allow
mosquitoes to hatch freely. There are also large pig farms close to
residential areas, which would aid the spread of the virus. Many of the
victims have been children, another common hallmark of the disease.
Japanese encephalitis causes severe [encephalitis and is passed from
animals to humans by mosquito bites. It is prevalent in agricultural areas
throughout south and east Asia, killing about 10 000 people each year. But
doctors in Siliguri say they still cannot be certain about the identity of
the latest outbreak.
