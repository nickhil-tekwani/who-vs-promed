Rubella in Japan
-------------
The number of rubella cases in Japan, especially in Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, has been increasing rapidly since January 2013. According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 745 cases of rubella infection have been reported from 1st to 7th week [1 Jan-16 Feb] of 2013 in Japan, almost 20 times higher than a year ago. Of the 745 cases of rubella infection, 591 (79 percent) were male. Among the male patients, 88 percent were aged from 20s through 40s. In the background of this trend, there is the fact that boys had not been vaccinated against rubella by the national immunization program until 1995.

Last year's [2012] rubella epidemic hit 2353 people in total, but just 19 in January. Although there were 5 cases of congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) last year, another case of CRS has already been reported in January 2013.

On 29 Jan 2013, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare issued a nationwide alert about the potential for another epidemic and recommended that prefectures and other local governments start promoting vaccination. However, 133 cases of rubella infection were reported in the 8th week [17-23 Feb 2013] in Tokyo, according to the latest report from Infectious Disease Surveillance Center of Tokyo. The appropriate [preventive measures] including urgent vaccinations are recommended especially for women trying to get pregnant and their husbands.

[As a result of the circumstance that in Japan prior to 1995 male children were not administered rubella vaccine, there is currently a marked increase in rubella virus infection among males aged predominantly between 20 and 40 years of age.

Rubella is an acute, contagious viral infection. While the illness is generally mild in children, it has serious consequences in pregnant women, causing fetal death or congenital defects known as congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). Rubella virus is transmitted by airborne droplets when infected people sneeze or cough. Humans are the only known host. In children, the disease is usually mild, with symptoms including a rash, low fever (under 39 deg C/102.2 deg F), nausea and mild conjunctivitis. The rash, which occurs in 50-80 percent of cases, usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body and lasts 1-3 days. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3-10 days.

When an adult woman is infected with rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90 percent chance of passing the virus on to her fetus. This can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, or severe birth defects known as CRS. Infants with CRS may excrete the virus for a year or more. Children with CRS can suffer hearing impairments, eye and heart defects, and other lifelong disabilities, including autism, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid dysfunction, many of which require costly therapy, surgeries, and other expensive care.

Rubella vaccine is normally included as a component of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) triple vaccine administered in early childhood. The rubella component of the MMR triple childhood vaccine is a live [naturally] attenuated strain that has been in use for more than 40 years. A single dose gives more than 95 percent long-lasting immunity, which is similar to that induced by natural infection. The reason for the past policy in Japan to withhold rubella vaccine from male children prior to 1995 is unclear.

While young males are not badly affected by rubella virus infection, they help to maintain the virus in circulation in the Japanese population. - Mod.CP
