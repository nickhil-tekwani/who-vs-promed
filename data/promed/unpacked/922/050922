A yellow fever case, contracted abroad, was confirmed in east China's Fujian Province on Thursday [24 Mar 2016], the provincial health and family planning commission announced on Friday [25 Mar 2016].

The patient, a 42 year old woman from Fuqing City, came down with a fever, chills and joint pain in Angola on 11 Mar [2016] after receiving a yellow fever vaccination in a hospital in Luanda, capital of Angola, on 7 Mar [2016]. She returned to China on 12 Mar [2016] and sought medical treatment in a hospital in the city of Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, on 14 Mar [2016]. She tested positive for yellow fever and is being hospitalized at Fuzhou Infectious Disease Hospital. She is in a stable condition. She had not been vaccinated before traveling to Angola.

This is the province's 1st case of yellow fever reported this year [2016]. So far, China has reported 6 yellow fever cases since 13 Mar [2016], all contracted abroad by patients who had traveled to Angola.

Yellow fever is an acute viral disease transmitted by infected mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical regions of Africa and Central and South America. Symptoms include fever, jaundice, and bleeding.

[The number of yellow fever (YF) virus infected Chinese citizens returning to China from Angola has now added another case, bringing the total to 6. The woman was likely already infected when she was vaccinated, since she became symptomatic 4 days post-vaccination. That seems more probable than a generalized YF vaccine infection, which can occur in one in one million vaccinees.

On 24 Mar 2016, the Chinese Embassy issued another message saying that Chinese citizens in Angola who have not been vaccinated, or who have passed the 10-year period of protection, should immediately get vaccinated. One hopes that any unvaccinated Chinese workers in Angola will act on this message, for their own health while in Angola and to eliminate the risk of dissemination of the virus when they leave, should they be viremic on departure.
