More skin infections linked to pedicures reported in SJ
---------------------------------------------------
The number of women believed to have developed serious skin infections
after receiving pedicures in San Jose, CA has risen, and there are new
ideas about how bacteria is spreading despite attempts by many nail salon
owners at following state cleanliness guidelines. Santa Clara County Public
Health Department spokeswoman Joy Alexiou said there are now 40 cases being
investigated, a jump of 10 cases reported in a single day.
Health officials began receiving reports from local doctors as early as May
2004 regarding an influx of patients with boils and skin ulcers on their
feet and lower legs.
It was determined that the women received pedicures prior to the
infections, which likely stemmed from using a whirlpool foot bath, which
are notorious breeding grounds for bacteria.
"We assume that things will continue for some time," Alexiou said. "There
have been 13 calls from different doctors."
The infection stems from the spread of a nontuberculous mycobacterium, a
microbe that causes painful open sores that have forced some women in years
past to undergo reconstructive surgery to hide the scars. In 2001, the
state cosmetology board adopted new regulations to ensure that foot spa
equipment is properly maintained.
Between each customer, the foot spa must be drained and cleaned with
approved disinfectant as well as soap, according to state cosmetology board
spokeswoman Patti Roberts.
Roberts said at the end of each day the foot spa screen, along with any
debris, must be removed before cleaning the basin with soap and water.
Every other week, the basin must be cleaned and soaked with a bleach
solution for at least 6 hours.
Deedee Carlson, president of the San Francisco Institute of Aesthetics and
Cosmetology, said bacteria could hide in the foot spa's jets. Even if
properly scrubbed out, once the spa is turned back on the bacteria will be
re-introduced into the water. To ensure no bacteria are trapped in the
jets, each foot spa should be run for 10 minutes while being soaked in
approved disinfectant, eliminating the hiding bacteria.
Carlson said many operators believe it's adequate to just scrub the spas,
but more preventive maintenance is required. "It's like a mini hot tub,"
Carslon said. "Bacteria like dark, dirty, damp and warm places. The jets
are a perfect environment."
