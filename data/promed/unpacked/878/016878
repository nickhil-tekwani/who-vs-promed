1st report of Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus infecting chilli in India
M.S. Khan, S.K. Raj <skraj2@rediffmail.com> and R. Singh, Molecular Virology,
National Botanical Research Institute, Lucknow-226001, India Accepted for
publication 24 May 2005.
Chilli (_Capsicum annuum_), a member of the family _Solanaceae_, is an
important spice crop cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical countries. The
crop is severely affected by leaf curl disease in most of the chilli-
cultivating areas of India. Symptoms consisting of leaf curling, shortening of
internodes and petioles, crowding of leaves and stunting of whole plants were
observed in chilli fields around Lucknow. The pathogen was experimentally
transmitted from infected to healthy chilli and tomato seedlings by the
whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_. Inoculated chilli plants developed typical symptoms
of the disease. However, inoculated tomato plants developed severe leaf curl
symptoms similar to those of leaf curl disease of tomato caused by Tomato leaf
curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV).
To confirm the association of a begomovirus with the disease, polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed using the total DNA isolated from naturally
infected chilli leaves and a set of primers designed to amplify the coat
protein region of ToLCNDV (previously called Indian tomato leaf curl virus;
Hallan, 1998). An amplification product of the expected size (~800 bp) was
produced. The amplicon was cloned and sequenced (AY883570). A Blast search
analysis of the nucleotide sequence showed 89-93 percent identity with various
ToLCNDV isolates (X78956, AY428769, TLU15016 and AF448058). However, the
isolate under study was found to be only distantly related to Pepper leaf curl
Bangladesh virus (AF314531) and Chilli leaf curl virus-[Multan] (AF336806) to
which it shows 86 percent and 81 percent identity, respectively.
Based on these findings, the virus infecting chilli has been tentatively
identified as an isolate of ToLCNDV. This is the 1st report of ToLCNDV
affecting chilli crops in India. Taken together with the recent report of
ToLCNDV affecting chilli cultivation in Pakistan (Hussain et al., 2004), this
indicates that, on the Indian sub-continent, chilli is a major alternative host
of ToLCNDV.

[Natural hosts of ToLCNDV include tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) and potato
(_Solanum tuberosum_). Aside from the damage that ToLCNDV can cause in potato
and tomato, there is the added fact that chilli pepper (_Capsicum annuum_) is a
major host of the virus. Growers will likely have to contend with using
herbicides in order to provide better growing conditions in their fields. To
date, there are 17 strains of ToLCNDV in addition to 2 from Thailand and a
potential strain from India (ToLCNDV) from pumpkin. The majority of ToLNDCV
stains are from India (13) and Mexico (8).
