African swine fever (ASF) has been detected on a farm in the Kaiserstuhl district of Emmendingen. Appropriate measures were initiated immediately, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. The ministry reported on the outbreak of African swine fever on Thursday morning [26 May 2022] in Stuttgart.

"It was only a matter of time before African swine fever (ASF) reached Baden-Wuerttemberg. The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI), which is responsible for animal diseases, confirmed the presence of the virus yesterday evening [25 May 2022) in samples from a holding with fattening pigs in the Emmendingen district. This has officially confirmed the outbreak of ASF in pigs kept in Baden-Wuerttemberg," said the Minister for Food, Rural Areas and Consumer Protection, Peter Hauk, on Thursday morning [26 May 2022] at a digital press conference in Stuttgart.

With the support of other authorities in the state, the Emmendingen district office is carrying out disease control measures on the infected farm. From [19 May 2022] until yesterday morning [25 May 2022] several pigs died from a herd of fattening pigs. The Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Office (CVUA) in Freiburg examined 2 dead animals to determine the cause of death. The laboratory test results gave a first indication of ASF, which the FLI then confirmed on Wednesday evening [25 May 2022]. After several animals had already died on the farm, the remaining animals were killed on Wednesday morning [25 May 2022] by the Emmendingen district office.

"We are currently unable to provide any information on the specific route of infection. The MLR [Ministry for Rural Areas in Baden-Württemberg] is in close contact with the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI). At the beginning of next week, the FLI epidemiology team will come to Baden-Württemberg and support the local authorities with their epidemiological investigations. In addition, we hope that the gene sequencing of the pathogen by the FLI will provide further information about its origin," said Hauk. "We currently have to assume that the entry was caused by human action," explained the minister.

The authorities immediately set up an exclusion zone with a minimum radius of 3 kilometers [1.86 mi] and a surveillance zone with an outer radius of at least 10 kilometers [6.21 mi] around the affected company. These restricted areas extended to the districts of Emmendingen, Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and the district of Ortenau.

The movement of pigs into or out of the farms is prohibited in the exclusion zone. This also applies to markets with pigs and any gathering of pigs. The restriction applies to the shipment of fresh meat and meat products from pigs from slaughterhouses or game processing plants as well. According to the MLR, animal by-products and liquid manure, manure and bedding from pigs should also not be taken out of the farms. Exceptions are only possible under strict conditions. Affected pet owners could contact the responsible district office.

"Because this is an outbreak in domestic pigs, there are no restrictions on crop products such as feed, straw or other agricultural products such as beef, fruit and vegetables. These may continue to be moved," explained Minister Hauk. In principle, comparable provisions apply to the surveillance zone. However, there are certain exemptions in individual cases.

In the virtual press conference, Hauk emphasized that monitoring is now important in order to clarify whether local events are occurring on the farm and whether wild boars are not affected. That is why the establishment of a regular, planned search for fallen game is now the focus. "In order to make the search quick and efficient, we use teams of 2, consisting of 2 people and a suitable dog, to systematically search the search area for possible carcasses. Tomorrow about 20 teams in Emmendingen will start the search. The search teams are supported outside of forest areas by drone teams with thermal imaging cameras," explained Hauk.

In order to prevent the possible spread of the disease, all wild boar killed and injured in the districts of Offenburg, Emmendingen and Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald are serologically tested. The hunters are provided with sample kits that are evaluated by the CVUAs.

Hauk pointed out that there has been a biosecurity project team in Baden-Wuerttemberg since last year [2021], which comes to the pig farms on request and checks the biosecurity measures free of charge and advises the farms. "I, therefore, appeal once again to all pig farmers in the country to take advantage of this offer so that we don't get any further outbreaks of diseases in domestic pigs. Biosecurity measures must be complied with on the farms," he emphasized.

ASF is not a zoonosis, i.e. a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans or vice versa. There is, therefore, no risk to human health when eating meat that may have been contaminated.

"It's hitting the pig farmers very hard at the moment. Various measures have led to a continuous decline in pork sales. That's why I appeal to consumers, but above all to retailers: support the pig farmers and buy pork. There is no reason not to do this," the minister stressed.

The state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg has been preparing intensively for an outbreak of ASF for years. To this end, the MLR has defined an action plan for the prevention and control of ASF. "For this purpose, a permanent crisis management team was set up in the MLR, which has been meeting regularly for years, coordinates the preparations for an ASF outbreak in the country and was able to start work immediately yesterday," said Hauk.

Minister Hauk thanked the authorities, in particular the Emmendingen District Office, as well as the Freiburg Regional Council and the Freiburg Chemical and Veterinary Investigation Office, which had immediately initiated the necessary measures with the support of the Animal Disease Control Task Force at the Tübingen Regional Council and in close contact with the Ministry of Food, Rural Areas and Consumer Protection coordinated the further procedure.

[The new ASF outbreak, on a farm in the Kaiserstuhl district of Emmendingen, Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been notified by Germany to the OIE on Thu 26 May 2022. Date of start - 24 May 2022; date of confirmation - 25 May 2022.

Diagnosis obtained by PCR at the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute on 26 May 2022
Affected population:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Swine / 35 / 16 / 16 / 19 / 0 / 0

The report, including a map, is available at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=54607.

Baden-Wuerttemberg is a state in southwest Germany bordering France and Switzerland. The Black Forest lies in its mountainous southwest. The leap of ASF, probably from northeast Germany, to this region is bad news to the local pig industry and a serious threat to the French and Swiss pig industries. Results of the epidemiological investigation into the source and route of introduction are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
