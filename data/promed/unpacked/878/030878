Citrus viroid V: Molecular characterization and synergistic
interactions with other members of the genus _Apscaviroid_
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Studies on _Atalantia citroides_, a citrus relative, revealed the
existence of a viroid not described previously. The new viroid has a
GC-rich genome of 293-294 nucleotides and contains the central
conserved region characteristic of members of the genus
_Apscaviroid_, and the terminal conserved region present in this and
other genera of the family _Pospiviroidae_. The secondary structure
of minimum free energy predicted for the new viroid is a rod-like
conformation with 68.7 percent paired nucleotides and showing
sequence identities with other viroids always lower than 90 percent,
the conventional limit that separates different species within a
given genus.
Infectivity assays showed that the new viroid induces mild but
characteristic symptoms on the indicator Etrog citron. Co-inoculation
of CVd-V [Citrus viroid V] with either _Citrus bent leaf viroid_ or
_Citrus viroid III_, 2 other members of the genus _Apscaviroid_
infecting citrus, disclosed synergistic interactions manifested in
enhanced leaf symptoms and very pronounced dwarfing. Viroid titers,
however, remained unaltered in co-infected plants. Possible
mechanisms underlying the observed synergistic effects remain to be
investigated.
According to its molecular and biological properties and its unusual
ability to replicate in _A. citroides_, the new viroid, tentatively
named Citrus viroid V (CVd-V), should be considered a new species of
the genus _Apscaviroid_.

[Previously, 6 viroid species infecting citrus had been
characterised: _Citrus exocortis viroid_ (CEVd), _Citrus bent leaf
viroid_ (CBLVd), _Citrus viroid III_ (CVd-III), _Hop stunt viroid_
(HSVd; synonym _Citrus cachexia viroid_), _Citrus viroid IV_
(CVd-IV), and Citrus viroid OS (CVd-OS). All belong to the family
_Pospiviroidae_ whose type member is _Potato spindle tuber viroid_
(PSTVd), and more may exist. The origin of the new CVd-V is still
uncertain, however it is thought likely that it was present in citrus
infected with HSVd or CVd-III, but overlooked until now.
Multiple viral or viroid infections are common in field plants with
the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement) or
cross-protection (competitive suppression, used in disease
management). Vegetative propagation increases the risk of a build-up
of these pathogens in a crop, and dramatic yield increases are
frequently observed in virus- or viroid-free cultivars. In some
crops, deliberate infection with viroids is used as a dwarfing agent
(for example in citrus and chrysanthemum).
Interactions between co-infecting viroids in citrus are well known,
but the mechanisms are unclear. Viroids are widespread in citrus that
has been propagated from symptomless viroid-infected budwood. All
citrus viroids induce specific symptoms on the Etrog cultivar of
citron (_Citrus medica_, widely used as a virus/viroid indicator
species), but only CEVd and HSVd cause specific symptoms (exocortis
and cachexia diseases, respectively) in other citrus hosts. Other
citrus viroids, particularly CBLVd and CVd-III of the genus
_Apscaviroid_, do not induce easily recognisable effects in citrus
used commercially (as scions or rootstocks), but infection may cause
reduction in tree size and yield. However, in co-infection with the
new CVd-V, a dramatic increase in symptom severity of CBLVd and
CVd-III is reported here.
Citrus viroids are transmitted by grafting and mechanical means. The
finding of a new citrus viroid with strong synergistic effects
highlights the importance of using viroid-free rootstock and grafting
material in citrus cultivation.
