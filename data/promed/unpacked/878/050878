Legionnaires' bacteria emerge again
------------------------------------
The potentially fatal Legionnaires' bacterium has flared up again, this
time in the town of Gjovik and in Vestfold County. The bacteria were found
in a cleaning plant in Gjovik, Oppland County and at an oil refinery in
Slagentangen in Vestfold. Tests were made at the refinery after an
employee was infected.
Health officials in Gjovik contend the Legionnaires' discovery there
presents little danger, but they're urging anyone who fears infection to
contact their doctor. The company running the cleaning plant, Norsk
Metallfragmentering, has shut it down, reports Norwegian Broadcasting
(NRK). Health officials in Vestfold, meanwhile, believe a man from Ulefoss
was infected on the job at the Slagentangen refinery.
10 Norwegians died earlier this summer after an outbreak of Legionnaires'
Disease in southeastern Norway. More than 50 were infected.

[This case seems unrelated to the recent cluster. Vestfold is adjacent to
Ostfold, where the previous outbreak was. The city of Gjovik is also in
southeastern Norway, somewhat further north and inland. - Mod.LL]
