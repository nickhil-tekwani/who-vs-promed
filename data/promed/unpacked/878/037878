The epidemiology department of the animal health branch of the
National Center for Agricultural and Livestock Research provided a
summary of the results of the diagnoses of zoonosis performed at the
center during epidemiological weeks 14 to 17, corresponding to the
month of April 2004.
During that period, 52 samples of equine serum and 2 equine brains
were tested. Samples were received from the states of Yaracuy (n = 4)
7.7 percent; Guarico (n = 42) 80.7 percent; Cojedes (n = 1 brain);
Aragua (n = 1 brain), and Falcon (n = 6) 11.5 percent.
Results: The 4 samples of equine serum from the state of Yaracuy,
municipality of Bolivar, were negative for viral isolation, with EEE
antibody titers of 1/320 in one sample by hemagglutinin inhibition
(HI) test (positive for EEE by serology). One sample showed titers of
1/20 for Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis (VEE) only, and the remaining
2 were negative. The laboratory results of the rest of the samples
are still pending.

Venezuela. It is significant to have some type of surveillance and
reporting to raise awareness in this country. - Mod.TG]
