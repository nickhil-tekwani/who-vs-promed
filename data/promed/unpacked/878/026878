Florida agriculture scientists are performing necropsies on Monday [20 Apr
2009] on 21 horses that died as they were being prepared to compete in a
Sunday polo match in Wellington, Florida. "We'll be testing blood and
tissue to see what the common denominator was here; was it something
injected; was it bad water, and so forth," said Terence McElroy, a
spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

The horses were part of the Venezuelan-based Lechuza Caracas team and were
being kept at the team's trailers on the grounds of the International Polo
Club Palm Beach. 15 horses that seemed disoriented died before Sunday's [19
Apr 2009] match, said McElroy, and their bodies were sent to the state-run
Kissimmee Diagnostic Laboratories near Orlando, Florida.

Two horses initially collapsed, and, as veterinarians and team officials
scrambled to revive them, 5 others became dizzy, Tim O'Connor, spokesman
for the polo club, said on Sunday [19 Apr 2009].

Some of the 15 horses died immediately, but some lingered for about 45
minutes, Dr Scott Swerdlin of the Palm Beach Equine Clinic said on Sunday
[19 Apr 2009], according to a report in the Sun-Sentinel newspaper. The
clinic is the International Polo Club's consulting veterinarian group, the
newspaper said.

Six of the 21 horses were kept overnight in the same trailer in Wellington,
said McElroy, and died sometime between Sunday and Monday [19-20 Apr 2009].
Their bodies have not been taken to the Kissimmee laboratory. The US Polo
Association, the sport's governing body, is expected to open an
investigation on Monday.

Celeste Kunz, chief examining veterinarian at the New York Racing
Association, said on Monday [20 Apr 2009] that she suspected a tainted
substance was injected into the horses. "[It was] something that was
administered for it to work in a short amount of time and have an animal
succumb that quickly," Kunz said. "My thought is that something was
injected because it would have to affect the central nervous system."

She dismissed the chances that the horses ingested something, because it
would take longer to metabolize and they would show signs of illness sooner
than they did before the match. Anabolic steroids are not likely to have
caused the deaths either, she said. "It takes at least 5 days for [anabolic
steroids] to really work, and the effects aren't real obvious at first,"
she said. "Most of the time [anabolic steroids] are used to build up their
muscularity."

Each team brings between 40 to 60 horses for matches. The ponies are
continuously switched out throughout a match to keep them from overexerting
themselves, O'Connor said. The horses were between 10 and 11 years old and
were valued at about USD 100 000 each, club spokesman O'Connor said,
according to the Sun-Sentinel. The owner of the Lechuza Caracas team was
also the owner of most of the horses, CNN learned. A meeting will be held
to determine whether Lechuza Caracas will compete at a later date, he said.
"Everybody is kind of in shock and trying to figure out what happened," he
said. "Nobody can recall an incident in which this many horses have died at
once."

[This is a substantial number of horses to be down and dying or dead in
such a short time. It is unlikely that this many would be affected at
essentially the same time if it were an infectious cause, so it rather
looks like it could be a toxin or contaminant. I would tend to think
cyanide, which could be acquired through hay or through an air handling
system; a common, contaminated feed would also be a possible cause; and
lastly, I might think about an injection that was contaminated or
mislabeled, or was intentionally the wrong substance. - Mod.TG]
