A Consultant Public Health Physician and Epidemiologist with the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Dr Ismail Abdul-Salam has disclosed that 15 deaths have so far been recorded out of 354 suspected cases of cholera in the state.

Speaking at a stakeholders' forum organized by the State Ministry of the Environment, Office of Environmental Services, Abdul-Salam, who presented a lecture entitled, 'Prevention and Control of Cholera,' said the figures were obtained from a study carried out following the outbreak of cholera in the state.

"The 1st case of suspected cholera outbreak in Lagos was reported in 19 Sep 2013 on Lagos Island and later at Amuwo Odofin Local Government Area. "As at the 12th week into the outbreak, 15 councils had reported at least one suspected case of cholera with 354 suspected cases. There are currently 15 labs and 109 Epilink confirmed cases. 15 deaths have been recorded. The case fatality rate is 12 percent," he said.

Noting the results indicated that the majority of the patients ate a local salad popularly called 'Abacha' and due to poor sanitary environment, he said prompt intervention management of cases at secondary health facilities, and availability of cholera kits and other consumables prevented the disease from spreading.
