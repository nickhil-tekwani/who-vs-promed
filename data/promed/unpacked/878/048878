ANTIBIOTICS, AGRICULTURAL USE, CDC POSITION - USA

[The following post was received on the FOODSAFE list following a
discussion of the impact of animal antibiotics on antibiotic-resistant
foodborne pathogens. Several comments had suggested that antibiotic use in
animals in the US was minimal and tightly controlled by veterinary rules.
This discussion prompted the following response. -- RAL]
I have read with interest the recent comments on "Foodsafe" pertaining to
the human health consequences of antimicrobial agents used in food
animals....I feel compelled to clarify several items.
CDC and other public health officials acknowledge the need for antimicrobial
agents for TREATMENT of infections in food animals. We further believe that
food animal veterinarians should be allowed use of all classes of
antimicrobial agents, even those classes of agents which are very precious
in human medicine (such as fluoroquinolones) provided adequate public health
safeguards are present to prevent the emergence and transfer of
antimicrobial-resistant pathogens (particularly Salmonella) to humans
through the food supply. Unfortunately, although adequate public health
safeguards are in place to prevent the presence of antimicrobial residues in
foods, the current drug approval process does not have adequate safeguards
to prevent the emergence antimicrobial resistance and dissemination of
antimicrobial resistance to humans.
CDC and other health officials also acknowledge that most human _Salmonella_
and _Campylobacter_ infections in the United States, including
antimicrobial-resistant infections caused by these pathogens, come from
ingestion of food, often foods of animal origin, contaminated with these
pathogens. Further, there is clear evidence that use of antimicrobial agents
in humans has very little, if any, influence on the emergence of
antimicrobial resistance among THESE pathogens (as an aside, human use of
antimicrobials for other infections, such as ear infections in children, has
everything to do with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among those
pathogens). Since emergence of antimicrobial resistance occurs only
following antimicrobial use, we (and many others) are left with the
conclusion that antimicrobial resistant among these foodborne pathogens is
the direct result of antimicrobial use, both therapeutic and sub therapuetic,
in food producing animals........we know of no other explanation (except for
some effect contributed by the use of antimicrobial use in orchards).
These conclusions where reached at a recent WHO meeting in Berlin, the
report of which may be obtained at
<http://www.who.ch/programmes/emc/vph.htm>. We would be happy to send you more
information on these issues if you would send us (e-mail address
<fja0@cdc.gov>) your address.
As for the erroneous statements made previously [on FOODSAFE] .... we are
not aware of any "cancelled" uses of growth promoter agents. Tetracycline
and penicillin are still widely used sub therapeutically in the US and
Canada (although this use was prohibited decades ago in Japan, Australia,
New Zealand, and Europe). It is not true that growth promoter uses of these
agents are expensive ... they are extremely inexpensive. It is not true that
most antimicrobial agents used in food animals are for therapeutic uses; the
sub therapeutic uses greatly outweigh the therapeutic uses. It is not true
that the NCBA has a moratorium on growth promotion uses.....in fact many (if
not most) dairy calves in the US are feed medicated milk replacer (it is
true that penicillin has never been used in cattle as growth promoters and
that the CBA as suggested that cattle not be given growth promoter -- or
some such language). It is not true that sub therapeutic use of
antimicrobials is highly regulated (or more regulated than in human
medicine) ... for example, although no antimicrobial agents are allowed to
sold over-the-counter for human use in the US, many agents are sold
over-the-counter for food animal use.
Finally, the suggestion [also on FOODAFE] that CDC somehow "tampered" with
the data which was presented in the NEJM [New England Journal of Medicine]
article is without merit and only serves to be inflame the discussion. CDC
is a science-based organization with no vested interests other than the
public's health --- the NEJM article was fully "cleared", and endorsed at
the highest levels, by CDC. Even if the NEJM is discounted (which I don't
think it should), there remains irrefutable evidence that antimicrobial use,
sub therapeutic and therapeutic, in food animals leads to the emergence of
antimicrobial resistant Salmonella and Campylobacter, which are transmitted
to human via the food supply, resulting in adverse human health consequences.
