On 21 May 2012, tuberculosis samples sent from a laboratory in Nijmegen to laboratories in the rest of the Netherlands have been found to be contaminated by the bacterium _Brucella melitensis_. It causes brucellosis, also called Malta fever. Symptoms may include fever, headache, fatigue, malaise, and sweating.

The Nijmegen research laboratory has asked that all laboratories submit a list of employees who have worked with the samples and observe them for the development of any symptoms.

Unrecognized, brucellosis can become chronic and in some cases, serious complications such as heart valve infection and central nervous system infection may occur. The disease can be treated with antimicrobial agents.

[Although not specifically stated so, it may be the case that the specimens were forwarded to other laboratories in the Netherlands to assess the ability of the labs to isolate and identify the pathogen. These specimens are now reported to be contaminated with _Brucella melitensis_, one of the species of brucellae that cause infections in humans. Concern regarding the spread of brucellae in the clinical laboratory is real, for example references 1-3, and specimens with the possibility of brucellae in culture should be handled in an appropriate isolation to prevent aerosol spread, which can occur with high attack rates in the lab, related to the ability of a low inoculum to cause infection. Post-exposure prophylaxis is often recommended, often with the combination of doxycycline and rifampin for 21 days.
