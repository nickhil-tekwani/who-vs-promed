GOLDEN NEMATODE, POTATO - CANADA (QUEBEC): 1ST REPORT

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed the
detection of a potato pest, Golden Nematode, in a 30-acre field on a
farm in the Municipalite regionale de comte (MRC) de Lajemmerais
approximately 20 kilometres east of Montreal, Quebec.
The Golden Nematode does not pose a risk to human health. Golden
Nematode and Pale Cyst Nematode are 2 species of Potato Cyst
Nematodes considered quarantine pests internationally because they
can significantly affect the yields of potatoes and other host crops,
such as tomatoes and eggplants. These pests infest the soil where
host crops are grown and have been known to reduce yields by up to 80
per cent. They are very difficult to eradicate because they can
persist dormant in the soil for several decades.
Both of these quarantine Potato Cyst Nematodes have been previously
confirmed in 65 countries worldwide, including limited areas of
Canada and the United States. In Canada, strict movement restrictions
are in place to prevent the potential spread of these pests to
non-infested areas.
Canada strictly regulates areas known to be infested with PCN and
samples anything suspected to be infested with this pest. Samples are
also taken and tested at the request of some importing countries.
The CFIA has begun an investigation in collaboration with the
Government of Quebec and industry. Records of field usage, equipment
and seed sources are available from the affected farm. Strict
quarantine measures have been implemented on the affected property in
accordance with internationally recognized scientific standards.
Extensive root and soil sampling is underway. The CFIA is confident
that the measures in place will prevent the spread of this pest to
non-infested areas.
The affected farm does not produce seed potatoes and is not in an
area located near seed production. Canada has been exporting seed
potatoes for more than 90 years to over 26 countries, many of which
require routine testing of seed potatoes for this pest. There has
never been a detection of Golden Nematode or Pale Cyst Nematode in
Canadian seed potatoes.
The CFIA, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Province of Quebec
are working with industry to respond to this issue. We are also
working closely with our trading partners to mitigate any trade
implications by providing evidence that supports a science-based
regionalization response.
Information on this investigation will be posted to the CFIA's Web
site (<http://www.inspection.gc.ca>) as it becomes available.

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is susceptible to the
potato cyst nematode (_Globodera rostochiensis_, PCN), which is also
known as the golden nematode (PCN/GN) especially in N. America.
The PCN is found in many places where potatoes are grown including
Europe (see link for worldwide distribution map). There are 2 species
of PCN affecting potato crops. The white or pale PCN (_Globodera
pallida_) is now believed to be the more dominant species in Europe,
while the yellow or golden PCN (_Globodera rostochiensis_) still
causes serious losses in some areas.
In North America _G. pallida_ was only known in Newfoundland, Canada
until 21 Apr 2006 and 13 Jun 2006 when it was newly detected in
continental USA. Two infested sites in Idaho are now known
(20060423.1195, 20060805.2161).
_G. rostochiensis_ is known in New York State in mainland USA and on
Vancouver Island, British Columbia and Newfoundland in Canada.
Because of effective Canadian and US quarantines, which have been in
existence for over 50 years, PCN/GN remains confined to portions of
Vancouver Island, Newfoundland and 9 counties within the State of New York.
This article reports on the detection of the PCN/GN in Lajemmerais,
south-eastern Quebec Province, Canada near the USA border, which is
the 1st report for mainland Canada. The quarantine practices that
have contained the nematode in other areas of N. American will now
have to be practiced in Quebec. The article goes to some pains to
point out that the seed potato crop in Quebec has not been contaminated.
On 20 Apr 2006 Canada put restrictions on the import of potatoes and
soil from Idaho, USA based on the detection of the pale PCN in
Idaho. It will be interesting to follow what the consequences to
Canada will be from the Aug 2006 detection of the PCN/GN in Quebec Province.
