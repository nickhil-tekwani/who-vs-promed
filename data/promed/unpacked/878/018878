A medical consultant with the Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH), Professor Chika Ogbonna, has said that over 5000 people die of Lassa fever yearly and that over 300 000 others get infected with the disease in the country yearly. He disclosed this on Wednesday [6 Feb 2013] in Jos, the Plateau state capital, during a sensitisation workshop on Lassa fever in the state. The professor, who described the disease as very deadly, said the patient experiences symptoms 2-3 weeks after infection.

Meanwhile, the federal government has said that it is determined to nip [it] in the bud to stop the spread of the fever in the country. The minister of health, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu, added that the government is working toward bringing assistance to the general public and to prevent further mortality arising from the disease in the state and the country in general.

[Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The illness was discovered in 1969 when 2 missionary nurses died in Nigeria, West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animalborne. In areas of Africa where the disease is endemic, Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe multi-system disease. Lassa fever is also associated with occasional epidemics, during which the case fatality rate may reach 50 per cent.

According to the CDC Special Pathogens website (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/lassaf.htm): "The number of Lassa virus infections per year in West Africa is estimated at 100 000 to 300 000, with approximately 5000 deaths. Unfortunately, such estimates are crude, because surveillance for cases of the disease is not uniformly performed. In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, it is known that 10-16 per cent of people admitted to hospitals have Lassa fever, which indicates the serious impact of the disease on the population of this region."

While the figures for case numbers and fatalities in Plateau state of Nigeria seem very large, they are not unexpected, since Plateau state is one of the mid-belt states of Nigeria reporting high incidence of Lassa fever. An accurate account of the numbers of Lassa fever cases in Plateau state and other mid-belt states supported by laboratory diagnostics would be welcomed.
