Schmallenberg virus found in deformed lambs
-------------------------------------------
Schmallenberg virus has been identified in Finland for the 1st time in lambs. Previously, only antibodies of the virus have been found in Finland. Discovery of the virus is not unexpected, as antibody studies indicated that the virus has become widespread in Finland during the summer and autumn 2012. The virus does not affect humans.

The virus was identified using the PCR method at the Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira in 3 deformed lambs, all from the same flock and born at full term at the end of December [2012]. The ewes had been infected at the end of August or early September in the early stages of pregnancy. The lambs had arthrogryposis of the limbs, either straight of flexed, and hydrocephalus, which are typical deformities caused by the Schmallenberg virus. Deformed lambs are not viable.

Since the Schmallenberg virus has spread into Finland in summer and autumn 2012, it is expected that deformed lambs are born between December and February and calves most likely in the period between March and May. The virus is spread by midges from one ruminant to another. When the temperatures drop, midges become inactive and the spread of the virus stops. The risk of deformities concerns lambs born between December and February, as midges were active at the start of the ewe's pregnancy. Most lambs are usually born later, in March-May.

The virus causes symptoms as it spreads to new areas, where ruminants do not have protection created by the infection. If the virus is endemic, ruminants are usually infected at such an early age that they are protected before the first pregnancy.

It is not known at present whether or not the virus is capable of overwintering in Finland. It is likely that midges carrying the virus will continue to arrive in Finland carried by southerly and south-westerly winds.

Schmallenberg cases up 24 percent in a month
----------------------------------
Confirmed cases of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] have soared by 24 percent in the past month, suggesting the disease is spreading rapidly through sheep and cattle this season.

The latest figures, released on Mon (14 Jan 2012) by the Animal Health and Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), show 1211 cases of the disease have now been confirmed in England, Scotland, and Wales.

This is equivalent to an increase of 24 percent on the last survey results, released in December [2012], which showed 976 confirmed cases.

The virus, which causes fatal birth defects and miscarriages in sheep and cattle, has now spread to every county of England and Wales and is wreaking havoc among livestock farmers, according to reports.

Devon, Cornwall and Dorset have recorded the highest number of cases -- 126, 68, and 59 respectively. But a worryingly high number of cases has also been confirmed in Shropshire (56) Cheshire (53) and North Yorkshire (41), suggesting the disease is rapidly spreading northwards, as scientists had feared.

Wales has 104 confirmed cases of the virus, including 21 in Carmarthenshire. Scotland has 9 confirmed cases -- 5 in cattle and 4 in sheep -- but all these cases relate from animals introduced into Scotland from English counties.

An AHVLA spokesman said: "The SBV has now been detected everywhere south of the England/Scotland border. We are now seeing an increase in confirmed cases in northern and western regions, including Wales, which suggests that for a lot of flocks and herds in those regions, they are effectively seeing their 1st year of SBV.

"The virus may well have worked through flocks and herds in the south of England where a level of immunity has been seen to develop. But that's probably not going to be the case for farms in Northumberland and western holdings this year."

Because the virus has now spread to every county in England and Wales, the AHVLA has stopped its free-testing service for Schmallenberg. "We are no longer providing free testing. However, some farmers will still want to pay for testing to establish once and for all if they have got the disease in their herds and flocks," confirmed the spokesman.

Farmers who suspect the disease in their livestock should contact their vets if they have any concerns, the AHVLA said.

The SBV causes mild to moderate symptoms in adult cattle, including fever, reduced milk yield and diarrhoea, and stillbirth and birth deformities in sheep, cattle and goats.

Scientists believe the virus 1st was spread to the UK by biting midges in the summer of 2011 and it 1st appeared on the continent before crossing the Channel.

A vaccine to protect livestock against the disease, produced by MSD Animal Health, has been submitted to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), and is waiting approval for full commercial use. However, it is understood that the vaccine may not be ready for introduction for this lambing season.

In response to ProMED-mail's request for information on SBV in Estonia (posting 20130114.1497803), we have been reminded that DEFRA's Preliminary Outbreak Assessment reference VITT/1200 "BTV in Eastern Europe 2012," dated 28 Nov 2012 (see posting 20121205.1439689), included the following passage: "The recent reports of Schmallenberg virus from Poland and Estonia would suggest that vectors are active and likely to have been capable of transmitting arboviruses over the summer months." We have not been able to trace the mentioned "recent reports" on SBV in Estonia during 2012 elsewhere on the internet. Our thanks to Sabine Zentis for the reminder. - Mod.AS
