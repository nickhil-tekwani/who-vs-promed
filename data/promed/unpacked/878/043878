There have been 325 confirmed diagnoses in the county this year [2012], the 2nd highest number in the country. The actual total is believed to be higher because not every suspected case is sent for testing. The outbreak has been blamed on the poor uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with people either not vaccinated at all or only having one of the necessary 2 doses. More cases are expected to emerge over the coming weeks as the impact of children returning to schools and nurseries after the summer break is felt.

Brighton and Hove has been the hardest hit area with 192 cases. People are being urged to contact their GP to make sure all children are up to date with their vaccinations.

Brighton and Hove is a unitary authority area and city on the south coast of England. It is England's most populous seaside resort. The unitary authority was formed from the unification of Brighton, the major part of the city with around 155 000 people of the 256 000 total population, with the nearby town of Hove. - Mod.CP

Ten people died of measles virus infection from 17 Sep 2012 to the present date in Menongue City, capital of the south eastern Kuando Kubango province, a fact that is worrying the local health authorities. ANGOP [Angola News Agency] has learnt that most of the deceased are children below the age of 2, but there is also the record of a 35 year old adult.

According to the head of the Menongue Municipality Health Department, Carlos Jonas, who gave this information to ANGOP on Thursday [11 Oct 2012], the authorities have reinforced routine vaccination activities. From Thu 17 Sep 2012 up to the present date, the authorities recorded 320 cases of measles in Menongue City, a number that is deemed very high considering the period of the outbreak.

According to official sources, 10 people are currently inpatients in the central hospital for medical assistance, while others are getting ambulatory treatment.

[The death toll of 10 individuals (all but one less than 2 years old) among 320 cases within a period of 25 days is an example of the devastating impact of measles virus infection in the absence of comprehensive immunisation.

Measles cases in Narok North district have been reduced drastically, according to district medical officer of health Dr David Kuria. Addressing reporters in his office yesterday [7 Oct 2012], Kuria said 346 cases of measles have been reported since January [2012]. He attributed the drop to the stringent measures which were put in place by the Department of Public Health.

Kuria thanked parents for ensuring that children below 5 years old are immunised. The medical officer said the sustainable campaigns against the disease carried out in Olokurto, Mao and Central divisions helped in achieving 60 per cent coverage in the fight against the disease. However, Kuria accused some parents of failing to take their children for immunisation. "These parents do not take their children to be immunised during clinical check-ups. This has led to the outbreak of the disease in some places," he said.

The Prince Albert Parkland Health Region [Saskatchewan] is investigating the 1st case of measles there since 2007. Health officials say a man is recovering from the illness, but there may have been others who were exposed to the virus. Chief medical health officer Dr Khani Chokani says: "It's a highly infectious virus that will spread very, very quickly by air and essentially through large droplets. The exposure time period can last up to 2 hours." That is why the Prince Albert Parkland Health Region is advising people who were at risk of exposure to be aware of symptoms, which usually occur 8 to 12 days after exposure but can show up after 18 days. Chokani says since the health region has low immunization rates, there is a stronger possibility of having more than one case.

The most potential for exposure occurred at "Amy's on 2nd" restaurant between 28 Sep-3 Oct 2012, at the Crescent Heights Family Medical Centre the afternoon of 1 Oct 2012, and at the Victoria Hospital Emergency Department on 3 Oct 2012 from 2:30 pm until 4:00 am on 4 Oct 2012. "Individuals may have been exposed to measles virus and may become ill if they have not had the vaccine for measles or have not had the disease before." said Chokani.

The Prince Albert man who had the measles did travel, but health region officials won't say where he was. They will only say that he is now fully recovered. They're hoping to avoid any future cases by letting the public know about the serious and potentially fatal illness. Chokani added: "It has a very poor outcome if the person is not fully vaccinated."
