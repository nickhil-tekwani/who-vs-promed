Haemorrhagic Fever Outbreak in Province Orientale
-------------------------------------------------
Kinshasa - The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has
issued an alert regarding an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever that has so far
killed 8 people in Orientale Province, a region plagued by fighting among
various rebel groups and ethnic factions.
According to DRC Health Minister Dr Mashako Mamba, who is also the
coordinator of the country's epidemiological alert system, the 8 deaths were
caused by a type of haemorrhagic fever not yet identified due to armed
hostilities throughout the region. "We are calling upon all belligerents to
allow medical emergency teams full access to work under peaceful
conditions," Mashako said.
Mashako reported that so far, 6 people had died in Watsa (550 km northeast
of Kisangani), one died in Isiro (370 km northeast of Kisangani) and another
in Ango (481 km north of Kisangani). All those who died had the same
symptoms: blood in their eyes and nose, as well as in their urine and
stools.
NGOs and other independent health organisations have not yet been able to
confirm the outbreak. The number of people thus far infected also remains
unknown. "The epidemiological alert system functions independent of the war
situation, because we still receive reliable information by radio from
rebel-controlled territory," Mashako said. "Given the conditions in the
region, it is difficult to organise the necessary response and to establish
the chain of people who came into contact with the deceased." A crisis
committee has been organised to oversee the emergency.
A similar epidemic previously affected Watsa in 1999. It began in January
1999, but did not come to the attention of international health
organisations until April [1999]. [In 2000 16 cases of Marburg hemorrhagic
fever were diagnosed at Durba-Watsa. Marburg virus infection was confirmed
in March this year (2002) from cases in the Watsa area -- see ref. below.]

[The differential diagnosis would also include -- among others -- yellow
fever, Ebola & Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fevers. We await further details
with interest. - Mod.JW]
