Ranchuelo municipality in Villa Clara Province is in a state of alert related to cholera, public health authorities stated, reporting cases of cholera in the population. So far, 20 sick people, including 6 children, have been admitted to the emergency center of provincial hospital "Martyrs of April 9."

Political opposition leader Yosmel Martinez Corcho reported that the town did not have access to safe drinking water because of breakage of its turbines, and, so far, the municipal authorities have not resolved the problem.

"People have to carry water long distances," he said. "People are consuming dirty water."

Two Haitian nationals have died, and 15 others are hospitalized with symptoms of cholera in Batey de La Matilla, 14 km away from the city of Higuey [in the Dominican Republic]. The deceased are 26 and 50 years old; the other patients were transferred to various health centers in the eastern region.

The authorities sent several doctors to give them professional attention and thus prevent the spread of this disease to others bateyes. The residents are hoping that the illness will not reach the municipality of Higuey and the tourist areas of Bavaro and Punta Cana.

The patients are hospitalized in Higuey, Nuestra Senora de la Altagracia, La Romana and San Rafael de Yuma.

[It is unclear whether the infection in the Haitian nationals was acquired in Haiti or in the Dominican Republic [DR].

La Altagracia Province is the easternmost province in DR, and the popular tourist destination of Punta Cana is located at the province's most eastern tip. - Mod.LL
