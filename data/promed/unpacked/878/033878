Police are investigating whether 3 off-duty officers were poisoned after they fell ill during a night out in Florida.

The group started [suddenly] sweating and vomiting after visiting 4 downtown bars and restaurants in the city of Sanford for dinner and drinks on 16 Sep 2020, according to a police report quoted by the Orlando Sentinel.

Two of the officers were taken to hospital, with one officer being put on a ventilator to assist with breathing.

All 3 are members of the Orlando Police but were not in uniform, have since recovered and left hospital.

They described how the symptoms included muscle pain, profuse sweating, and vomiting appearing "all at once out of nowhere".

The police report stated a medic told them one went in and out of consciousness and "appeared to be having the symptoms of someone who may be overdosing."

Healthcare staff told Sanford police one officer "may have been drugged" with Rohypnol or GHB [gamma hydroxybutyrate], it is claimed.

A doctor who treated one of them at a Seminole County hospital also said the officer "might be experiencing the effect of being drugged or poisoned", according to the police report.

Investigators are now awaiting the results of toxicology tests.

[Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) is used in the short-term treatment of insomnia and as a premedication for surgery. Rohypnol is also known as the date rape drug due to its amnesia properties when used illicitly. Victims given the drug would have limited or no recollection (https://www.drugs.com/illicit/rohypnol.html)

While everyone may enjoy the bar, it seems the patrons were perhaps not as watchful over their drinks as they should have been. Being watchful of your drinks should apply to any one at the establishment. It is possible the drinks were contaminated at the source, that is, the bar. Likely an investigation regarding the source of the drug is ongoing. We are glad to hear the individuals are doing well. - Mod.TG
