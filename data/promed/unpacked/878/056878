The Ministry of National Food Security and Research has decided to import the vaccine for lumpy skin disease [LSD] as the so-called virus has killed more than 100 000 animals [see comment], triggering fears of milk and meat scarcity.

According to sources in the ministry, it has been decided to seek the vaccine for the disease as soon as possible, and for the purpose, the Animal Husbandry Commission -- a department of the ministry -- has started working with the agencies concerned.

They said that a summary for the import/purchase of the vaccine has been prepared and will be sent to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet for its approval.

There is also a risk of milk and meat scarcity in the country due to the deaths of the animals. "If timely treatment is administered, the death rate could be less than 1%."

All Pakistan Farmers Foundation Chairman Syed Mehmood Bukhari told The Express Tribune that farmers had lost tens of millions of rupees due to the deaths of animals.

"Hundreds of animals are getting sick fast," he said, urging government to compensate the people whose animals were dying.

Economic damage is also feared from this disease as it could affect milk production. It is found in cattle in Punjab and Sindh.

[Pakistan's 1st report on LSD was submitted to WOAH (then OIE) on 4 Mar 2022 (20220308.8701867); it included the following epidemiological comment:
"LSD cases have been reported from limited areas of 2 provinces in Pakistan. First suspected case of LSD from Bahawalpur region of Punjab province was reported to AHC/CVO dated 27 Oct 2021. Accordingly, National Veterinary Laboratories (NVL) conducted sampling and further investigations in coordination with the local veterinary authority. Other suspected cases of LSD were reported from Jamshoro and Thatta region of Sindh dated 1 Dec 2021, and Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (CVDL) Sindh conducted sampling and further investigations in coordination with the local veterinary authority. Provincial veterinary authorities instantly took control and prevention measures. Since disease was 1st time seen in Pakistan, and diagnostic kits and reagents had to be imported, which took longer time therefore, LSD has been confirmed in March 2022. AHC/CVO Pakistan has immediately issued guidelines for control and prevention of LSD for Provincial Veterinary Authorities. Now, the situation is under control".

According to the recommendations of an EU (AFSA) expert panel (20160812.4410864), it is necessary to implement vaccination of the entire susceptible cattle population in regions at risk for LSDV introduction or affected by LSDV. This is in order to minimise the number of outbreaks. High vaccination coverage at animal and farm levels, should be achieved. Diseased animals should not be vaccinated.

The disease has been circulating in Punjab for at least 8 months, and in Sindh for more than 7 months. The recorded wide further spread of the virus warrants a considerable increase of the vaccination coverage, in particular in regions hitherto uninfected.

The reported mortality figures (100 000) deserve to be officially confirmed. Though causing serious economic losses, the average case/mortality rate of LSD is approximately 10%; it may be higher in secondary infections. - Mod.AS
