HANTAVIRUSES - BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA (11)
======================================

Both Dobrava and Puumala like viruses are involved in the present outbreak
of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in north eastern Bosnia
B Niklasson, M Hukic, A Lundkvist
We have recently reported an outbreak of haemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS) in north eastern Bosnia (1). During the last 12 months more
than 300 HFRS patients have been admitted to Tuzla hospital. Acute
hantavirus infection was confirmed by antigen-capture IgM ELISA and IgG ELISA
using both Puumala (PUU) and Hantaan (HTN) antigens (2).
It has previously been reported that PUU and Dobrava (DOB) serotypes
circulate in this region (3,4). To address the question of which serotype(s)
that are involved in the present outbreak, we have now tested convalescent
sera from the HFRS patients admitted to Tuzla hospital by focus reduction
neutralization test (FRNT) (5). The sera were collected between 3 weeks and
6 months post onset of infection. The results from 8 representative patients
are shown in Table 1.
The FRNT data clearly shows that at least two different hantaviruses are
involved in the present outbreak. The viruses involved are serologically
identical, or closely related, to Puumala and Dobrava virus. Previous
studies have indicated Dobrava virus to be associated with a severe form of
HFRS, while Puumala virus is associated with a milder form. Both viruses are
spread by rodents. The reservoirs are the field mouse (Apodemus flavicollis)
and the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) for Dobrava and Puumala,
respectively (4, 6). Small rodents, including mice and voles, now seem to be
quite abundant in north eastern Bosnia (1).
HFRS is of concern to the health authorities in the former Yugoslavia and in
countries that have troops stationed there. The finding that two different
hantaviruses are involved in the present outbreak makes it more complicated
for the clinicians in terms of expected mortality and frequency of
complications. The data presented also make clear that it is necessary to
include Puumala, and also one of the two serologically related Hantaan or
Dobrava viruses, to serologically diagnose patients during the acute stage
of the disease.
