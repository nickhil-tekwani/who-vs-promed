Local health officials are urging people to [be] cautious around wild animals after an individual was bitten by a rabid fox in West Pensacola [Escambia County, Florida] recently.

The fox attacked the individual during the daytime in the area of Dog Track Road, according to a Florida Department of Health (FDOH) in Escambia County news release. FDOH-Escambia's environmental health specialists collected tissue samples from the fox which were used by the state laboratory to confirm the presence of the rabies virus.

Rabies is a viral disease that infects the central nervous system. Without proper treatment, rabies can cause brain infection and death. Rabies is transmitted by a rabid animal by a bite, a scratch or by contact with mucous membranes such as the eyes, nose or mouth. A series of "rabies shots" can protect a bite victim from developing the rabies infection, if given soon after the bite occurs.

"Rabies is a fatal infection but is preventable," notes FDOH-Escambia's director, Dr. John J. Lanza. "It is important to not feed or pet wild and stray animals, to avoid animals that appear to be acting strangely and to keep pets vaccinated against rabies. Persons who are bitten by a wild animal or an animal who has not been vaccinated against rabies should seek immediate medical care. Proper medical treatment of an animal bite can be lifesaving."

In Florida, raccoons, foxes, bats and cats are the animals most frequently diagnosed with rabies. Other animals that are at high risk for rabies include dogs, bobcats, skunks and otters. Because of their proximity to people, stray and unvaccinated cats and dogs pose a special risk.

You cannot always tell if an animal has rabies by looking at it. To protect yourself and your loved ones against rabies follow these steps:
- Teach your children not to go near wild and stray animals, and never keep them as pets.
- Vaccinate your dog, cat, ferret or horse to protect against rabies. Keep vaccinations up-to-date.
- Do not feed your pets outside. The food may attract wild animals.
- Make sure your garbage is securely covered. Open garbage attracts wild and stray animals.
- Spay or neuter your pet to reduce its tendency to roam or fight.
- Do not let your pets roam freely or allow them to interact with wild or stray animals. Keep them in a fenced yard or on a leash at all times.
- Call Escambia County Animal Control, at (850) 595-0097, to remove stray animals from your neighborhood.
- Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, churches, schools and other similar areas where they might come into contact with people and pets.
- If your pet is bitten by another animal, immediately seek veterinary assistance for the animal and contact Escambia County Animal Control.
- If you are bitten by a wild animal or by any animal that is acting strangely, seek medical care as soon as possible so that a physician can evaluate your risk of rabies infection and administer the rabies vaccine if appropriate.

FDOH-Escambia's Environmental Health division investigates animal bite reports, tests animals for rabies through the state laboratory, and orders animal quarantine as necessary. For more information, or to report an animal bite, contact the FDOH-Escambia Environmental Health office at (850)595-6700 or visit http://www.escambiahealth.com.

[There is a correction of this report: Rabies - USA (46): update, November 2015, corr 20151116.3793758]

One person and a dog have both tested positive for the rabies virus, prompting the Florida Department of Health in Pasco County to issue a rabies alert for residents in the New Port Richey Estates area.

The affected area is listed below:
- Western boundary is the Gulf of Mexico
- Southern boundary is Gulf Trace Boulevard
- Eastern boundary is U.S. Highway 19

The alert will last for 60 days. The Health Department wants to remind residents that "rabies is present in the wild animal population and domestic animals are at risk if not vaccinated."

The Health Department also wants the public to be aware of these tips to help stop the spread of rabies.

- Keep rabies vaccinations up to date for all pets.

- Keep your pets under direct supervision so they do not come in contact with wild animals. If your pet is bitten by a wild animal, seek veterinary assistance for the animal immediately.

- Do not handle, feed, or unintentionally attract wild animals with open garbage cans or litter.

- Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home.

- Teach children never to handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, even if they appear friendly.

- Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, churches, schools, and other similar areas, where they might come in contact with people and pets.

- If you are bitten by any animal seek care promptly. Wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Go to your family doctor or hospital for medical attention immediately.

- Contact Pasco County Animal Services at (727) 834-3216, (813) 929-1212, or

[3] New Jersey: raccoon, human exposure

A young child has been bitten by a raccoon with rabies in the area of Easton Avenue in the Somerset section of Franklin township, according to the Somerset County [New Jersey] Department of Health.

On or about 6 Nov 2015, a young child was leaving a nursery school when she was attacked and scratched by a raccoon, the agency said. [This says the child was scratched, but the previous sentence above says the child was bitten; was it both, or which one happened? - Mod.TG]

Franklin Township Animal Control captured the raccoon and sent it to the public health laboratory at the New Jersey State Department of Health where rabies was confirmed, the agency said. The child is currently undergoing preventative treatment for rabies, the agency said.

Franklin Township residents who see an animal acting strangely should call the Franklin Township Animal Shelter at 732-873-2500, ext. 6255, or the Franklin Township Police Department at 732-873-2300, evenings and weekends.

"If you are bitten or attacked by an animal, do not delay in reporting it to the health authorities," said Somerset County Health Officer Dr. Paul Masaba. "Rabies is a serious illness that can be fatal in humans without treatment."

People can get rabies through animal bites or when saliva of an infected animal enters the body through cuts or scratches. Rabies is preventable with prompt medical attention, the agency said.

Anyone who is bitten or scratched by a wild or stray animal -- including stray dogs and cats -- should promptly wash the area with soap and water and seek medical attention, the agency said.

If a pet is bitten or scratched, take it to a vet promptly, the agency said.

In either case, be sure to report the incident immediately to the police and the local health department.

For health department contact information in Somerset County municipalities, visit http://www.co.somerset.nj.us/health/localhealth.aspx.

A listing of upcoming rabies clinics in Somerset County can be found on the Somerset County Department of Health events calendar at http://www.co.somerset.nj.us/health/events.aspx#rabies. The listing is updated as clinic dates are added.

A health official on Friday [6 Nov 2015] identified 6 Middlesex County [New Jersey] towns where 10 rabid animals have been found this year [2015], along with a caution that the true numbers might be much higher.

"These are just the ones that are found," said Health Director Tom Sikorski. "Rabies is throughout the state of New Jersey, particularly in bats and raccoons."

The latest rabid animal was a groundhog found in a woman's back yard in Old Bridge. The animal was alive when found, lying on its back.

The groundhog was one of 123 specimens tested for rabies after being found in Middlesex County. Nine others positive for the virus included cats, dogs, bats and raccoons.

The other rabid animals found in Middlesex County this year were 4 in South Brunswick; 3 in East Brunswick; 1 each in North Brunswick and Monroe Township.

Sikorski, who served for 38 years as the public health official in Old Bridge, said for every 1 case of rabies in New Jersey, there are perhaps 20 or more that health officials never know about.

[Several of these articles do a good job in pointing out what to do and what to watch for regarding animal behaviour and if you are bitten or attacked.

Rabies is a fatal disease, with rare exception, and those that have survived are very different in capabilities and even in memory from prior to the bite.

However, only one of these articles mentions a rabies drive. Every article should point out where to get a vaccination for your pet. Having vaccinated pets builds a barrier between you and the disease and helps protect your pet from the disease and you from the heartache of having to euthanize your pet. Rabies vaccines are generally given at 4 months of age, again at 1 year and then either the following year or 3rd year, depending upon recommendations of the area and the type of vaccine used.

Veterinary groups in these communities will hopefully step up and offer rabies clinics. Cities and municipal areas should assist the veterinary groups by providing advertising and a location. - Mod.TG
