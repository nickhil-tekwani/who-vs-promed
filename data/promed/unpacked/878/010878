Virginia: Norovirus Outbreak Closes Hotel
------------------------------------------
A Fairfax County hotel remained closed yesterday [Sat 8 Jun 2003] as
workers scoured every available surface -- from elevator buttons to door
handles and curtain rods -- after tests confirmed that about 60 guests from
2 wedding parties there last weekend had contracted the same type of
intestinal illness that recently has plagued some cruise ships. While the
Hyatt Dulles at Washington Dulles International Airport was being scrubbed
down inside with a powerful chlorine bleach, Herndon High School's prom,
scheduled to be held at the hotel last night, was moved to its sister hotel
in Reston.
The origin of the norovirus that caused the wedding guests' symptoms has
not been determined, health officials said yesterday, and there is no
evidence that it came from the hotel. But precautions were being taken to
ensure that the stubborn virus did not continue to spread.
"This virus can be more resistant than other viruses," said Gloria
Addo-Ayensu, acting director of the Fairfax County Health Department.
Addo-Ayensu praised the hotel's management for quickly alerting health
officials after wedding guests starting calling the hotel Monday to report
that many members of their parties had gotten sick. Norovirus is very
common -- and very contagious -- she said, and many cases go unreported
unless there is an outbreak in a group (a hotel, school, nursing home, or
cruise ship) and people start comparing symptoms. Symptoms usually start 24
to 48 hours after exposure, and most people recover on their own in the
same time. No medication is prescribed -- just lots of fluids to prevent
dehydration.
Some infected guests submitted stool samples to a state lab for testing,
and confirmation of the norovirus came about 8 p.m. Friday, Addo-Ayensu
said. At that point, the hotel decided to close to new guests to facilitate
a thorough scrubdown with a chlorine-based cleaner about 8 times stronger
than most household brands. Health officials began surveying more than 350
people in their search for the virus's origin, which they said likely will
not be determined. No hotel employees are known to have contracted the
norovirus. State and Fairfax health officials are jointly investigating the
norovirus and trying to educate the public about the best prevention:
frequent hand-washing. The hotel kitchen was carefully examined and
received a clean bill of health, they said.
