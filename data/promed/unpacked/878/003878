As a result of an outbreak of impetigo, Madison-Plains Local Schools [Madison County, Ohio] will be closed Friday [9 Oct 2015]. Superintendent Tim Dettwiller said 4 kids have been sent home with confirmed impetigo. There are 60 other kids with rashes of unknown cause in grades K-9. The 1st rash appeared last Friday [2 Oct 2015], and the problem has escalated since then.

[One student], a 6th-grader, said the school nurse told her she had impetigo. "I had mosquito bites and it itches worse (than that)," she said. "I can't itch it either or it'll spread." She said she's scared because she doesn't know what the next step is. "I don't know what will happen after I'm done with this stuff. I don't know if it'll get worse." [The student's] mom said she is questioning how so many kids got infected. "I was freaked out and couldn't believe it. The 1st thing I thought was, are they not cleaning it good enough, or how can they [students] get it so quick?"

Bio Clean will clean the school on Friday [9 Oct 2015] and Saturday [10 Oct 2015]. They will fog the building with a substance that kills all viruses, bacteria, etc. Football games and athletic events for Friday and the weekend are still on pending a nurse inspection of athletes. That could change at any time.

According to The Mayo Clinic, impetigo usually appears as red sores on the face, especially around a child's nose and mouth. The sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts. You're exposed to the bacteria that cause impetigo when you come into contact with the sores of someone who's infected or with items they've touched -- such as clothing, bed linen, towels and even toys.

[Madison County, with a population of 43 435 in 2010, is a county located in the U.S. state of Ohio, immediately west of the city of Columbus, the state capital (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Ohio).

Impetigo is a highly contagious superficial infection of the skin that especially affects the skin around the nose and mouth, but can spread to other areas around the body. Blisters burst leaving honey-colored crusts. It is caused by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) or _Staphylococcus aureus_ and occurs more commonly in infants and children than adults. It is transmitted primarily from direct contact with someone who has impetigo or by contact with contaminated objects such as towels, toys, clothing, or household items. Hot, humid weather, and the presence of eczema predispose to developing impetigo. Antibiotic therapy can shorten the course of the disease and help prevent the spread to others. The patient may no longer be contagious 24-48 hours after starting antibiotic therapy. Impetigo may be complicated by post streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which cannot be prevented by prior antibiotic therapy of the impetigo. - Mod.ML
