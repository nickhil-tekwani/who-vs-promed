Unusual mortality in brown pelicans in San Diego, California
-----------------------------------------------
We have taken in 50 more birds in the past 2-3 days. 10 skinny birds, that
flew off course and ended up in Arizona, were driven in on Friday afternoon
[9 Jul 2004]. Those birds, which had been in rehab in Arizona, are doing
well, and have big appetites.
I will be screening 5 birds for PMV 1,2,3 and avian influenza on Mon 12 Jul
2004. I think we will have enough serum to also get arbovirus screens and
botulism testing. Botulism type C is common in Salton Sea pelicans (not far
from here), but type E is the "historic" sea bird variety.
I suspect that this event involves the young birds, because they just don't
have enough reserves to get to where the fish are. The local bait fishermen
report that the bait fish are currently farther out at sea. We had a
report, on Fri 9 Jul 2004, that many of these young birds are making it to
the Salton Sea, and, then, are gorging on the fish available there. Sadly,
this means that, although those birds may avoid starvation, they are at
risk for botulism once the Tilapia have high levels of botulism toxin in
their bodies.
The only new development from Mon 12 Jul 2004 is the finding of
hypoproteinemia (we are getting terminal bloods from birds now to have
sufficient serum for testing) and stomatitis. However, I had 8 birds for
necropsy today, and the severity and distribution of the stomatitis was
much less than in some of the birds we had yesterday [Sun 11 Jul 2004]. I
don't yet have the results of the histopathology on that lesion.
I expect I will have a more valuable update for you by mid-week next week
[3rd week of July 2004].
