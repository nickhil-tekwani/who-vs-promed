Recent tests confirmed that Asian soybean rust (ASR) was found in a
field in Ridgetown, Ontario, about 70 miles (113 km) east of Detroit,
according to a news release on the website of the Ontario Soybean
Growers Association. The find was confirmed by the Ontario Ministry
of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs and Agriculture (OMAFRA) and
Agri-Food Canada in Ottawa, the release said. "This is the 1st time
soybean rust has infected Canadian soybeans, however, it is too late
in the growing year for the disease to affect soybean yields," says
Albert Tenuta, field crop plant pathologist with OMAFRA. "Researchers
can't predict how the disease will act in Canada's climate, but we do
not expect this disease to overwinter in Ontario."

The tests were performed on sample soybean leaves because the
majority of the soybeans in Canada have either been harvested or are
too mature for the disease to affect 2007 crop yields. "We knew
soybean rust would eventually be introduced to Canada, and that it
was only a matter of time," according to Dale Petrie, general manager
of Ontario Soybean Growers.

Asian soybean rust requires a living host to survive, reproduce, and
overwinter, and is unlikely to find such a suitable host in the
northern United States or Canada due to the lack of green tissue
during winter months. During the 2007 growing season, spore traps
were placed throughout the province to detect ASR spores through air
and rainfall samples. Spores were detected in mid-July [2007] and
again in mid-August, but no infections on actual plants were
detected. Spore presence alone does not insure the disease will
occur. Favorable environmental conditions such as moisture levels and
temperature must be optimal for infection to take hold.

The possibility of infection for the 2008 growing season in Canada
will depend on the amount of rainfall received, wind patterns, and
infections in the USA.

[The fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ was identified in Japan in 1902
as the cause of soybean rust in Asia. It can cause premature
defoliation, with yield losses of up to 80 percent reported in that
region. It is widespread in Asia and Africa, but data are lacking
concerning its establishment in Europe. The 1st detection of _P.
pachyrhizi_ in the New World was in Paraguay in 2001, and it was
introduced into the USA in 2004. It has a wide host range of over 95
species, which is unusual for rust fungi. Besides soybean, a number
of other species in the family of _Fabaceae_ can also be affected.

Conditions that promote good growth of soybeans are also most
suitable for rust development. Temperatures of 15 to 28 deg C (59 -
82.4 deg F) and free moisture are needed for infection. Moisture also
promotes fungal spread within a crop. Weed species, for example kudzu
(Japanese arrowroot, _Pueraria lobata_), can serve as pathogen
reservoirs. Spores are spread by wind over long distances enabling
the pathogen to seasonally re-infect areas with winter temperatures
too low for the fungus to survive. The disease can be managed with
early detection and the use of fungicides. Partially resistant
soybean lines are available. However, new pathogen strains with
increased virulence and fungicide resistances are emerging.

A less virulent related species, _P. meibomiae_, is found in South
America and the Caribbean and causes rust symptoms on a similar range of hosts.

A spore trap is essentially a sticky slide that is transported past
an orifice through which air is drawn. The slide passes by the
orifice via a transport device and so spores, which hit the slide as
the air changes direction are attached to the slide. Spores are
identified by morphology to genus and sometimes species. Spore traps
are used for determining identity and time of dispersal of fungi.
