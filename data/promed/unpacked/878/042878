6th straight bird die-off prompts warning from scientists
---------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of dead birds have been found for the 6th straight year at a
popular hunting spot in south-central North Dakota.
Wildlife officials suspect that most of the deaths were caused by
salmonella, and they are warning people not to handle dead or sick
birds.
Officials discovered the deaths of about 1500 gulls and cormorants in
the last month on an island at the Roesler Lake Waterfowl Protection
Area, near Lehr.
"We've been looking at some management strategies to try and get the
thing stopped," said Bob Vanden Berge, district project leader with
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "There aren't really any good
ideas."
Although wildlife health officials have yet to conduct tests on the
dead birds, they suspect that some of the deaths were caused by avian
chlamydiosis. The disease, which primarily affects birds, can be
transmitted to humans who come in direct contact with sick birds or
areas where they congregate.
Health officials said human cases are rare, and the disease can be
easily treated with antibiotics. Infected people usually suffer
flu-like symptoms. "We have to err on the side of caution," said Rex
Sohn, wildlife disease specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey's
National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis. "We just want people
to be aware of it."
The Madison center has been testing dead birds from that site since
1999. The deaths have resulted from different diseases, even within
the same birds, said Kathryn Converse, wildlife disease specialist.
"Any place where you have colonial nesting birds, if there is a
disease outbreak it's going to be spread around pretty quickly,"
Converse said. Most of the birds die from salmonella or fungal
diseases, Vanden Berge said.
About 10 000 birds have been nesting in the area each year. In the
past, most of the dead birds have been fledglings that are
susceptible to disease, Converse said.
Some of the sick birds may continue to fly for a while, Vanden Berge
said. "Our concern is that someone will find one of these birds along
the highway or some other place and want to nurse it back to health,"
Vanden Berg said. "But it's not a good idea to pick up a sick or dead
bird, especially if it's a gull or a cormorant."
Signs have been posted at the wetland area, advising hunters and
other visitors about the outbreak.

[The risk of people getting infected by a potential zoonotic agent
while handling sick free-living water birds, is not unimaginable.
However, more background details, and especially laboratory
investigations, are needed before postulating or claiming that most
of the birds died of salmonella. If salmonellae are indeed prevalent
among the sick gulls and cormorants, either as etiological or as
non-causative agents, they should be identified. _Salmonella
typhimurium_ is the most common cause of salmonellosis in commercial
poultry, followed by _S. enteritidis_ and _S. heidelberg_. In the
USA, most infections in commercial poultry are produced by 10-20
species, while some species or strains are more pathogenic than
others. They may be abundant in wild fowl.
The news item mentioned 2 additional possible causes, namely
chlamydiosis and "fungal diseases". There are other potential causes
for die-offs in waterfowl, both infectious (bacterial, virological,
others) as well as non-infectious (organic and inorganic toxic
agents, including botulinum); several of them (for example --
chlamydiosis, West Nile virus and avian influenza) might have public
and animal health implications. All the above justifies a serious
epidemiological, laboratory-supported investigation. - Mod.AS]
