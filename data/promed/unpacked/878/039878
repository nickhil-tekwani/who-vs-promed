The world has fought many battles against the novel coronavirus since January 2020, losing more than 4.2 million people and vanquishing some of its spread. But the war is still raging and will do so for a long time. I predicted early last year [2020], in a best-case scenario, that we would face a 36 month battle before COVID-19 could be considered under human control. We are only now in month 19.

Sure enough, the United States is again awash in virus, with the incidence of new COVID-19 cases having soared 131% in the 3rd week of July [2021]. To be clear, the vaccines available work well -- especially the Pfizer and Moderna products based on mRNA technology. But it is likely that waning vaccine efficacy, coupled with a stubborn one-fifth of the adult population refusing any immunization, has opened the door for the dangerous mutant delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 to wreak havoc among the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.

That's why the United States is going to need a 3rd dose of mRNA vaccines; for the nation's older population, the triple play is already overdue. "I don't see the virus just disappearing," said Stanley Plotkin, considered the godfather of vaccinology. The University of Pennsylvania vaccine inventor and immunologist told me that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should comply with requests from Pfizer, following Israel's example, and immediately approve 3rd-dose immunization for adults over the age of 60, with general triple dosing for all Americans to follow. I agree.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has voiced opposition to 3rd dosing in richer nations before making primary doses available to billions of people in middle-income and poorer countries. It's a completely reasonable point, both morally and strategically, in the war against COVID-19. But evidence now points in an alarming new direction, suggesting that fully vaccinated individuals can carry the delta variant in their noses and mouths, shedding in some cases just as much virus to infect others as do unvaccinated infected individuals.

Moreover, in the absence of fully effective vaccination of better than 75% of adults, a society may act as a herd of walking petri dishes, cultivating immune-escape mutant forms of SARS-CoV-2 -- that is, mutants that evade existing vaccines. The vaccine that rolls out tomorrow in a poorer country may have already been rendered less effective by its prior inadequate, or incorrect, use in richer countries.

Urgent action is required from the Food and Drug Administration, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and their counterparts in Europe, Canada, and other parts of the world that have already widely administered vaccines. And recommending the usage of masks, while necessary, is no longer enough. The message must be that if you've had a 2nd shot, it's time to start planning to get a 3rd.

The data from vaccinated Israeli medical staff shows that while breakthrough infections aren't life-threatening, they are also not benign: 19% of cases led to so-called "long-haul COVID-19", featuring months of difficult symptoms that can include acute fatigue, depression, loss of stamina and muscle strength, brain fog, and other challenging disabilities.

The implications in the real world of these biological findings are overwhelming. Because the virus surges so rapidly after infection, peaking its viral load 2 or 3 days faster than garden-variety COVID-19, individuals who are carrying all that virus in their bodies have no idea, exhibit no symptoms, and take no special precautions to protect others. Worse, even if they were immunized by either vaccines or prior COVID-19 illness, they may be vulnerable to reinfection. That's for 2 reasons. First, the sheer volume of virus coming at their unmasked faces from a delta-infected individual is 3 orders of magnitude larger than anything their bodies were prepared for -- instead of encountering a few puffs of particles in the air, they are gulping down microscopic hurricanes of the stuff. And second, it surges inside their bodies faster than their B cell memory component can mobilize to generate neutralizing antibodies and other weaponry.

It also appears that the United States may have blundered by setting the time interval between the first 2 doses at 21 days -- a decision made by the CDC and FDA under the Trump administration. For reasons having less to do with science than with the rush to get as many British at least partially protected as rapidly as possible, Boris Johnson's government chose a far longer time interval between doses -- months. And that may explain why the delta variant's dire impact seems to be reversing in the UK, with daily incidence of new cases dropping rapidly. Plotkin, the vaccine inventor, says longer times between jabs -- perhaps 6 months -- give the immune system time to settle into its lulled memory status before getting another jolt of fake infection (which, after all, is what a vaccine is), prompting the manufacture of neutralizing antibodies. That length-of-interval issue has arisen with other vaccines, he says, consistently showing months, not days, are required between doses.

[2] Modelling study: relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions
[A] Risk of resistant variants

Relaxing restrictions like mask-wearing and social distancing when most people have been vaccinated greatly increases the risk of vaccine-resistant variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, new research showed on Friday [30 Jul 2021]. At a time when nearly 60% of Europeans have received at least one vaccine dose, the authors said their modeling study showed the need to maintain non-vaccination measures until everyone is fully jabbed.

To predict how the SARS-CoV-2 virus might mutate in response to vaccination campaigns, a pan-European team of experts simulated the probability of a vaccine-resistant strain emerging in a population of 10 million people over 3 years. Variables included vaccination, mutation and transmission rates -- including recurring "waves" of infections and declines in the number of cases in response to lockdowns.

Predictably, the model showed that a rapid rate of vaccination reduced the risk of a resistant strain emerging. But in what the authors called a "counterintuitive result", the model showed that the highest risk of resistant strains emerging came when a large proportion of the population was vaccinated but not large enough to ensure herd immunity. This is in essence where much of Europe is currently, where the delta variant is spreading rapidly.

The authors said the model showed a threshold of 60% of the population vaccinated, after which resistant variants were more likely to occur. The situation in the USA -- where 60% of adults are fully vaccinated and 80% of new cases are caused by the delta variant -- is similar.

"Vaccines are our best bet to beat this pandemic," said co-author Simon Rella, from Austria's Institute of Science and Technology (IST). "What our model showed is that when most people are vaccinated, the vaccine-resistant strain has an advantage over the original strain. This means that the vaccine-resistant strain spreads through the population faster than the original strain at a time when most people are vaccinated," Rella told journalists in an online briefing.

Viruses constantly mutate in response to environmental constraints, such as growing immunity and response measures designed to limit transmission. With SARS-CoV-2, the delta variant is significantly more infectious than the original virus variant, but there is currently little evidence to suggest it is more deadly.

Authors said that their research highlighted the need to maintain other anti-COVID measures until everyone is vaccinated. "Of course we hope that vaccine resistance does not evolve over the course of this pandemic, but we urge caution," said Fyodor Kondrashov, an IST researcher and study co-author. "Evolution is a very powerful force and maintaining some reasonable precautions throughout the whole vaccination period may actually be a good tool to control this evolution."

Currently just over one billion people around the world are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, with many countries -- particularly in Africa and South America -- yet to start widespread rollouts due to lack of supply. "Without global coordination, vaccine-resistant strains may be eliminated in some populations but could persist in others," said the study, published in Nature Scientific Reports. "Thus, a truly global vaccination effort may be necessary to reduce the chances of a global spread of a resistant strain."

Reacting to the study, Nick Davies, assistant professor of mathematical modeling at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said it showed the need for every country to "do their part to avoid creating fertile grounds for viral evolution. But ultimately, dealing with the emergence of a vaccine escape strain is really a global issue, not a national one," said Davies, who was not involved in the research. "As soon as a vaccine escape mutant emerges somewhere, it becomes everybody's problem."

A modelling study published in Scientific Reports looks at how rates of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and vaccination might impact the fate of vaccine resistant strains. Prof John Edmunds, professor in the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: "This modelling study looks at the conditions which increase the risk of the emergence and establishment of a vaccine-resistant variant. One of the key results is that the risk is highest when a large fraction of the population has been vaccinated, but transmission is also high. This is the situation we find ourselves in at the moment. It has to be remembered that this is a modelling study. The real world is always much more complex than can be represented in a model and chance will always play a key role. Nevertheless, studies like this can highlight threats and help us work through potential risk-mitigation strategies."

Dr Edward Hill, research fellow in Mathematical Epidemiology, University of Warwick, said: "In this peer-reviewed modelling study, the authors use a model with SARS-CoV-2 like parameters to assess the potential emergence of vaccine-resistant variants, and the role of the impact of the rate of vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the probability of the establishment of vaccine-resistant variants in the population.

"As stressed by the authors, the mechanism to adjust the transmission rate reflects the strengthening or relaxation of a package of non-pharmaceutical interventions. The model in the study does not attribute the effect of individual intervention measures on virus transmission rates.

"One of the authors' conclusions is that a global vaccination effort is necessary to reduce the chances of a global spread of a resistant strain, which corroborates other modelling work presented in a preprint (1) (not yet peer-reviewed) suggesting vaccine sharing between nations could be a powerful tool to decrease the potential for antigenic evolution. Therefore, there could be additional benefits to pursuing an equitable vaccine distribution worldwide beyond the protection provided by the vaccines to those receiving it.

"Models of infectious disease transmission are one tool, as part of a collective response, that can assess the impact of options seeking to control a disease outbreak. To achieve robust public health outcomes requires an interdisciplinary approach, with multiple sectors communicating and working together.

"Whilst the modelling can provide general principles (under stated model and parameter assumptions) for a vaccine-resistant variant having an increased chance of emerging and becoming established, the model cannot precisely tell us when such an event may happen or where it may happen.

"Therefore, it is crucial we have situational awareness of how the virus is mutating and identifying variants that are of concern; whether that concern be due to the variant being more transmissible, causing a rise in severity, immunity derived from vaccines or infection by another variant offering less protection against the new variant, or a combination of these. The World Health Organization advocates strengthening surveillance and sequencing capacity, and a systematic approach to provide a representative indication of the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Another potential benefit of having fewer infections is a higher proportion of overall infections can then be sequenced, enhancing the chance of earlier identification of emergent variants that are of concern.

"Vaccination remains a crucial tool in protecting us from COVID-19 illness and severe outcomes. As the vaccine rollout advances, it is important to continually monitor in the population (through observational studies using surveillance data) the impact of vaccination on epidemiological outcomes such as preventing infection, symptomatic disease, hospitalisation, death and onward transmission. Also, obtaining high vaccine uptake in all regions and eligible demographic groups is key to lessen the chances of there being parts of the population that have less immunity, reducing the potential for outbreaks to spread and lowering the chance of the emergence and establishment of a vaccine-resistant variant.

"With SARS-CoV-2 being a relatively novel virus, there is still uncertainty in its epidemiological, virological and immunological characteristics. As we accumulate new information over time our ideas and understanding will develop."

Dr Nick Davies, assistant professor of mathematical modelling, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: "Modelling studies of pathogen evolution, such as this one from Rella and colleagues, can help us to tease out how certain aspects of policy decisions might impact, in relative terms, upon the risk of a new SARS-CoV-2 variant emerging. Rella and colleagues find here that, when vaccine coverage is high, the risk of a vaccine strain emerging increases when the prevalence of infection is also high. This makes sense, since the probability of a vaccine-resistant strain emerging depends upon 2 factors: 1st, the strength of natural selection for a vaccine-resistant strain, which is stronger when the frequency of vaccinated individuals is higher in a given population; and 2nd, the rate at which potential vaccine-resistant mutations may emerge, which of course depends upon how many active infections there are in the first place, as each additional infection represents an additional opportunity for random mutation to produce a vaccine-resistant strain. Additionally, a vaccine-resistant strain is less likely to randomly die out during a period in which transmission is higher.

"The qualitative result -- basically, that the risk of a vaccine-escape mutant emerging will be lower if we keep cases down as much as possible -- certainly makes sense. However, I don't think we really know enough about the fundamental processes of SARS-CoV-2 mutation and selection to make solid quantitative predictions -- i.e., about how much any specific policy increases the risk of a vaccine mutant emerging and spreading, in absolute terms. With regard to UK policy, one could make the argument that by releasing restrictions now as opposed to in a few months' time, the probability of a vaccine escape mutant emerging in the UK might actually be lower, because seasonal factors and school closures will help to dampen transmission and lessen the probability of an escape mutant spreading widely.

"Every country should do their part to avoid creating fertile grounds for viral evolution where possible, which, thankfully, is a goal largely in alignment with public health and economic goals, as they all involve controlling transmission. But ultimately, dealing with the emergence of a vaccine escape strain is really a global issue, not a national one; as soon as a vaccine escape mutant emerges somewhere, it becomes everybody's problem. So I would think that the most important decisions for policy makers in the UK to minimise the risk of a vaccine escape strain involve: strengthening global genomic surveillance; having an effective plan for border surveillance and controls when needed; continuing to contribute to the scientific work of monitoring the properties of new variants, regardless of where they emerge, to look for early evidence of immune escape; and helping to build the global capacity for manufacturing and deploying both existing and updated vaccines quickly and equitably."

Dr Peter English, retired consultant in communicable disease control, former editor of Vaccines in Practice, immediate past chair of the BMA Public Health Medicine Committee, said: "There has been a lot of discussion about what the consequences of lifting 'non-pharmaceutical interventions' -- restrictions on mixing and measures such as mask-wearing and improved ventilation -- intended to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.

"This paper uses mathematical modelling to predict the consequences; in particular, the likelihood that a vaccine resistant strain of the virus will emerge. There is a saying that 'All models are wrong, but some are useful'. Modelling an issue like this is highly complex, and often a small change to the assumptions used can make a dramatic difference to the outcome of a model. Nevertheless, the assumptions made in this model appear robust.

"Furthermore, there is intuitive validity to its conclusions: '...we found that a fast rate of vaccination decreases the probability of emergence of a resistant strain. Counterintuitively, when a relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions happened at a time when most individuals of the population have already been vaccinated the probability of emergence of a resistant strain was greatly increased. Consequently, we show that a period of transmission reduction close to the end of the vaccination campaign can substantially reduce the probability of resistant strain establishment. Our results suggest that policymakers and individuals should consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions and transmission reducing behaviours throughout the entire vaccination period.'

"You would expect that as more people are vaccinated, and if the vaccines are effective at preventing infection and transmission (which they are), there will be less transmission of the virus (2). The more transmission there is, the more likely it is that significant 'variants of concern', including vaccine escape variants, will arise.

"Yet it is also the case that in a relatively unvaccinated population, vaccine escape variants will have little competitive advantage, and are unlikely to become prevalent. In moderately or highly vaccinated populations, however, variants that can still be transmitted to and by fully vaccinated people will have a considerable competitive advantage.

"So there is intuitive validity in the idea that using all means to minimise transmission, when a high proportion of the population is vaccinated, is important. Allowing high rates of transmission at this time means that fully vaccinated people are more likely to be infected; and this means that vaccine escape variants are more likely to arise and spread, undermining the value of the vaccination programme (at least until a 'tweaked' vaccine that is effective against the variant can be rolled out).

"Modelling studies such as this should always be viewed with caution; but the findings from this one are highly consistent with other ways of looking at the same question, and thus provide useful support for them."

[3] China: delta variant-fueled outbreak
Date: Sat 31 Jul 2021

Provinces across China have imposed tougher restrictions in an effort to racing to contain the country's worst coronavirus outbreak in months, with health officials attributing the surge in COVID-19 infections to the highly contagious delta variant. Authorities reported 328 symptomatic infections in July -- almost equal to the total number of local cases from February to June [2021]. "The main strain circulating at present is the delta variant...which poses an even greater challenge to virus prevention and control work," Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission (NHC), said at a news briefing on Saturday [31 Jul 2021].

It came a day after the World Health Organization (WHO) urged governments globally to contain delta before it turns into something deadlier and draws out the pandemic. WHO said an 80% average increase in COVID-19 cases was recorded over the past 4 weeks in 5 of the health agency's 6 regions, a jump largely fuelled by the fast-spreading delta variant. First detected in India, the strain has now reached 132 countries and territories. "Delta is a warning: it's a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge," WHO's emergencies director Michael Ryan told a news conference.

According to a leaked document by CDC in the United States, a review of findings from other countries showed that while the original SARS-CoV-2 was as contagious as the common cold, each person with delta infects on average 8 others, making it as transmissible as chickenpox but still less than measles.

In China, the current outbreak is geographically the largest to hit the country in several months, challenging its early success in curbing the pandemic within its borders. More than 260 infections nationwide have been linked to a cluster in Nanjing city in eastern Jiangsu province, where 9 cabin cleaners at an international airport tested positive on 20 Jul 2021. Hundreds of thousands have already been locked down in the province, while Nanjing has tested all 9.2 million residents twice.

The contagiousness of the delta variant, combined with the peak tourist season and high passenger circulation at the airport, has led to the rapid spread of this outbreak, NHC official He Qinghua told reporters at the briefing. Fresh cases reported on Saturday [31 Jul 2021] in 2 more regions -- Fujian province and the sprawling megacity of Chongqing -- included one patient who visited the tourist city of Xi'an, in Shaanxi province, and an international cargo crew member who recently travelled from abroad, authorities said. Officials in one Chongqing district ordered emergency mass testing late on Friday [30 Jul 2021] for people who had visited venues linked to confirmed cases.

After one asymptomatic case was discovered in Zhengzhou -- the epicentre of recent deadly floods in central Henan province -- city officials on Saturday [31 Jul 2021] ordered mass testing of all 10 million residents. The head of the city health commission was also sacked. The tourist city of Zhangjiajie in Hunan province, where the landscape inspired the "Avatar" blockbuster, locked down all 1.5 million residents and shut all tourist attractions on Friday [30 Jul 2021], according to an official notice. Health officials said the virus was likely brought there via the Nanjing cluster, according to preliminary investigations.

Officials are now scrambling to track people nationwide who recently travelled from Nanjing or Zhangjiajie and have urged tourists not to travel to areas where cases have been found.

After reports that some people sickened in the latest cluster were vaccinated, health officials said this was "normal" and stressed the importance of vaccination alongside strict measures. "The COVID vaccine's protection against the delta variant may have somewhat declined, but the current vaccine still has a good preventative and protective effect against the delta variant," said Feng Zijian, virologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

More than 1.6 billion vaccine doses have so far been administered nationwide as of Friday [30 Jul 2021], the NHC said. It does not provide figures on how many people have been fully vaccinated. Health officials have said they are aiming for 80% of the population to be fully vaccinated by the end of the year.
