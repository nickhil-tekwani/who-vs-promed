I am an administrator for a Social Media Networking group on Facebook, Pinterest, and Twitter called AHS Challenge.

The purpose of our Social Media Campaign is to share current information about African horse sickness and cases as they occur.

We are currently experiencing a terrible outbreak, and our group is recording details of every case brought to our attention. I would be happy to share details of what we have collected with you.

For your information, the African Horse Sickness Trust, the official body set up to monitor and report on this vector borne virus is currently reporting 208 cases. We have received details of nearly 3 times this number of cases, that is, 615 -- so under-reporting is a huge issue in our country.

Please let me know if you would be interested to receive our data for your records and information.

If you are affected by this outbreak, please report it to the authorities as well as this group. - Mods.TG/MPP
