The Carolinas are the home of the toxic dinoflagellate _Pfiesteria
piscicida_ (PP). This little microbe is a real caution, and I wonder if
any one has thought to look for signs or symptoms (including paralysis) of
PP. The folks at North Carolina State are hard at work on this (potentially
panic-over-able) problem.
I have fretted considerably over the proximity of the hog farms (and the
evolution of some form of people enabled PP variant). I had not considered
the mammalian sea life. I seriously hope they take a good look at the dead
and dying. I think we miss the boat when we do not necropsy animals who
deliberately beach themselves, especially when accompanied to shore by
companions. We give too little credit to these creatures with brains so
similar to our own.

definitive answers. - Mod.TG
