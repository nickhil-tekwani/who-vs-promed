Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics; As of Mon 7 Jul 2003
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health issued on Mon 7 Jul 2003 the latest information
about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This
includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or CJD (new var.)] -- the form of the disease thought
to be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as
follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Referrals of suspect CJD/ Deaths of definite and probable CJD
Year/ Referrals/ Sporadic/ Iatrogenic/ Familial/ GSS/ vCJD/ Total deaths
1990/ 53/ 28/ 5/ 0/ 0/ -/ 33
1991/ 75/ 32/ 1/ 3/ 0/ -/ 36
1992/ 96/ 45/ 2/ 5/ 1/ -/ 53

2003*/ 84/26/ 1/ 1/ 0/ 11/ 39
Total/1730/659/41/38/19/132/889
(*Provisional as of Mon 7 Jul 2003)
Summary of vCJD cases
Deaths:
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 99
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 30
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 3
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 132
Alive:
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 137
The precise definitions of the terms: Referrals, Deaths, Definite cases,
Probable vCJD cases, Sporadic, Probable sporadic, Iatrogenic, Familial,
GSS, variant CJD, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health web-site or by reference to a preceding ProMED-mail
post in this thread [CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693].
The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 4 Aug 2003.

[Since the previous monthly statistics released by the Department of Health
on Mon 2 Jun 2003, the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases
(dead and alive) has increased by 2, and the number of deaths has increased
by one. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive has increased by one.
These data are consistent with the continued decline in vCJD incidence
reported during the preceding 6 months.
In view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments in mice
reported by Asante et al. (MRC Prion Unit, University College, London) in
the EMBO Joural, Vol. 21, No. 23, 6358-6368, 2002, that: "Some patients
with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a disease arising
from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible association with BSE 20021129.5921),
the figures for sporadic CJD cases now have added significance in relation
to the course of the vCJD outbreak and will continued to be presented here.
<http://emboj.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/23/6358?etoc>
vCJD has been recognized to date only in individuals homozygous for
methionine at PRNP codon 129, and Asante et al. reported that transgenic
mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated with either bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions, may develop the
neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD, consistent with these
diseases being caused by the same prion strain. However, BSE transmission
to these transgenic mice, in addition to producing a vCJD-like phenotype,
also resulted in a distinct molecular phenotype that was indistinguishable
from that of sporadic CJD with PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more
than one BSE-derived prion strain might infect humans; it is therefore
possible that some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD
may have a disease arising from BSE exposure.
Since Mon 2 Jun 2003 the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD has
increased by 9. - Mod.CP]
