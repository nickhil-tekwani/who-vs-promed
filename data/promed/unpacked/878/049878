KARACHI, July 10.
Cases of gastroenteritis and diarrhoea, mostly among children, continue to
increase in the city. Such patients have been visiting the out-door
patient departments (OPDs) and casualty departments of government hospitals
in the city almost daily. However, most of the cases are being reported at
private clinics of general physicians every day.
Attributing the increase in the cases of gastroenteritis to the prevailing
unhygienic conditions, a polluted environment and impure water, doctors
said such patients complained of pain in the abdomen, vomited and suffered
from diarrhoea. They advised people that as soon as they come across a
person having the above-mentioned symptoms, they must take him or her to a
nearby hospital or clinic because excessive vomiting and diarrhoea lead to
dehydration.
Confirming that the cases of gastroenteritis which had shot up during May
have not yet subsided, doctors said as the cases of gastroenteritis would
continue to increase till August, people must drink a sufficient quantity
of boiled water, besides avoiding stale food and fruits. According to an
RMO [Regional Medical Officer?] at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre
(JPMC), the number of patients suffering from gastroenteritis at the
hospital's casualty department in 24 hours had increased to about 30 as
against 15 to 20 such cases during normal days. A doctor at the Civil
Hospital's casualty department also confirmed that the number of
gastroenteritis patients was on the rise as from 10 to 15 such patients
visited the hospital's emergency unit daily. However, these figures did not
include those who visit the hospital's OPDs daily, he said.
