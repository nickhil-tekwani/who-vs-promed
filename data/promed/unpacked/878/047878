White spot syndrome virus (Inf. with), Australia
----------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 18 Aug 2022
Confirmed: 23 Aug 2022
Reported: 24 Aug 2022
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in a zone or a compartment
Causal agent: White spot syndrome virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

Outbreak location: Yamba, Clarence Valley, New South Wales
Started: 18 Aug 2022
Epidemiological unit: farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Giant tiger prawn or black tiger shrimp (_Penaeus monodon_): Penaeidae-Farmed crustaceans / 400 / - / - / 400 / - / -

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: routine testing of prawn brood stock (_Penaeus monodon_) held in a biosecure facility was positive for white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) and subsequent testing confirmed WSSV. All animals within the facility have been destroyed and the facility is in the process of being decontaminated. The outbreak is contained to a single affected biosecure facility. Investigations into the source of the outbreak are ongoing.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: traceability; stamping out; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; movement control; disinfection

Diagnostic test results

[White spot disease is a highly contagious viral disease of decapod crustaceans including prawns, crabs, yabbies, and lobsters. The disease is caused by white spot syndrome virus.

An identification Field Guide of White spot disease is available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/infection-white-spot-syndrome-virus.pdf

History of the disease in Australia:

"White spot disease was first detected in South East Queensland in December 2016. Seven prawn farms on the Logan River were affected from late 2016 to early 2017. The virus was also first detected in wild populations of crustaceans, such as prawns and crabs in the northern part of Moreton Bay in early 2017.

Prawns on the infected farms were destroyed to eradicate the disease and farms later returned to production. Prawn farmers on the Logan River have applied a range of enhanced biosecurity measures to reduce the risk of a disease recurrence.

A Movement Regulated Area (MRA) in South East Queensland, which includes the Logan River area and Moreton Bay, was established in early 2017 to prevent movement of crustaceans and worms from the area, unless they are cooked or treated in a way that will de-activate the virus.

White spot syndrome virus has established in some populations of wild crustaceans within the MRA. A national surveillance program that commenced in 2017 demonstrated that all areas of Australia, outside of the MRA, have remained free from the virus.

Movement and fishing restrictions remain in place in the Queensland MRA".
