Foot and mouth disease in Zimbabwe
---------------------------------------
Suspected outbreaks in the export zone
Emergency report
Information received on 17 Jul 2003 from Dr Stuart K. Hargreaves, Director
of Veterinary Services, Ministry of Agriculture, Harare:
Report date: 17 Jul 2003.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical. Epithelia have been collected and will be
submitted for analysis to both the Botswana Vaccine Institute and
Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute in South Africa.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 16 Jul 2003.
Estimated date of first infection: 8 Jul 2003.
Suspected clinical foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been detected on 4
contiguous farms located 20 km south of Harare, in Manyame district of
Mashonaland East province:
1) On Dunnine farm (18 deg 10 min S - 31 deg 01 min E), 15 cases were
detected out of a susceptible population of 383 beef and 240 dairy cattle.
The lesions were fresh, consisting of unruptured vesicles and ulcers on the
tongue and inter-digital spaces.
2) On Imbwa farm (18 deg 04 min S - 30 deg 98 min E), 50 cases were
detected in a beef herd of 1438.
3) On Gilston farm (18 deg 08 min S - 30 deg 96 min E), a total of 120
cases were detected in a beef herd of 500.
4) On Boronia farm (17 min 99 min S - 30 deg 98 min E), 300 cases were seen
in a beef herd of 400.
The age of the lesions was similar at Gilston farm and Boronia farm.
Total number of animals in the suspected outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 2961 / 485 / ... / ... / ...
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: this is the first outbreak in the
Export Zone since 1989. Investigations on the source are currently under
way, but it is suspected that illegal movement of infected cattle from
provinces such as Masvingo and Manicaland, where FMD is enzootic, could
have led to the outbreak. Recently, there has been an increase in cattle
movement associated with the ongoing land reform. Some of the cattle
movements have been illegal, i.e. from areas quarantined for FMD.
B. Mode of spread: these 4 affected farms are within 10 km of one another,
suggesting local spread directly (through aerosols) or indirectly within
the cluster or spread from a common source, possibly a public sale.
Control measures:
- Quarantine: the provinces of Mashonaland East, Mashonaland Central, and
Mashonaland West have been put in quarantine and the only movement
permitted is for direct slaughter.
- Zoning: the traditional FMD control zones remain as before.
- Vaccination: vaccination coverage will now include areas at risk in
Mashonaland East province.
- Surveillance: all livestock in the quarantine areas are under regular and
intensive surveillance

[This report provides additional details on the very unfortunate incursion
of FMD into the export zone in Zimbabwe. It is indeed frustrating, even
from afar, to watch a country lose such a valuable resource, when the
situation is preventable. Unfortunately, it was easy to see the
progression of events leading towards this conclusion, and reestablishing
an export free zone will be most difficult under the present
circumstances. Interested parties would do well to read the moderator
comments on previous postings. - Mod PC]
