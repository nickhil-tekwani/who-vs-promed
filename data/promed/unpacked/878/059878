The government of New Caledonia informed the press On Tuesday [21 Jan 2014] of the occurrence of the 1st indigenous infection with the Zika virus. This was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.

The patient is a 76-year-old man living in Dumbea. His current state of health, however, presents no concern.

This is the 1st time a person has been infected on the Caledonian territory. The other 26 cases reported so far have been imported from French Polynesia, where already more than 35 000 cases have been detected.

The government reminds the people of New Caledonia of the importance of the use of repellents and the destruction of [mosquito] breeding sites around homes.

[The spread of Zika virus infection from French Polynesia is of concern but not surprising. The outbreak on the French Polynesian islands continued during weeks 42-52 of 2013 and presumably is still ongoing. That outbreak has been the source of cases with illnesses occurring in 3 individuals on New Caledonia reported on 2 Dec 2013 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131203.2089681) and, apparently, more imported cases since then.

Travellers coming from French Polynesia when arriving in New Caledonia have been advised to use insect repellants during the 7 days after landing and to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants and to consult a general practitioner if symptoms occur. Sleeping in screened rooms or under bed nets is recommended only for young children and sick people. Apparently, those measures were not enough to prevent ongoing transmission of the virus in New Caledonia. One hopes that the outbreak remains limited and does not reach the extent that it has on the French Polynesian islands.
