Ebola response roadmap - situation report 24 Dec 2014
-----------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
A total of 19 497 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) have been reported in 4 affected countries (Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone) and 4 previously affected countries (Nigeria, Senegal, Spain and the United States of America) in the 7 days to 21 Dec 2014 (week 51) [sic]*. There have been 7588 reported deaths (case definitions are provided in Annex 1).

[*They do not mean in 7 days; these are the totals since the start of data collection in March 2014 -- see below. However, they show 928 more cases and 688 more deaths than the 18 569 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 6900 deaths reported a week ago in the WHO sitrep of 17 Dec 2014, or well over 100 new cases and almost 100 deaths a day http://who.int/csr/disease/ebola/situation-reports/en. - Mod.JW]

Reported case incidence is fluctuating in Guinea and declining in Liberia. In Sierra Leone, there are signs that the increase in incidence has slowed, and that incidence may no longer be increasing. The country's west is now experiencing the most intense transmission in the affected countries, and response efforts have been strengthened to curb the spread of disease in the area. The reported case fatality rate in the 3 intense transmission countries among all cases for whom a definitive outcome is known is 70 per cent...

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
--------------------------------------------------
A total of 19 463 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD and 7573 deaths have been reported up to the end of 21 Dec 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Sierra Leone, and 20 Dec 2014 by the Ministry of Health of Liberia (table 1). The data are reported through WHO country offices...

[This supersedes http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-latest?lang=en of 23 Dec 2014, which has a table showing 19 340 cases, 7518 deaths.

The difference between the totals in the 1st paragraph of the summary above and the 1st paragraph of "Countries with widespread and intense transmission" may be explained by the inclusion of only the 3 countries most concerned in the table. 16 pages of detailed tables, maps and graphs are included, but it should be noted that WHO has acknowledged that all data from the 3 countries are incomplete, and only an unknown portion of these figures are confirmed, so they cannot be used to make reliable calculations of case fatality rates or detailed trends. - Mod.JW]

Ebola slows in Sierra Leone as community records zero infection for weeks
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The discharge of the last Ebola patient from Sierra Leone's Kailahun district, announced by the district medical officer of Kailahun, James Squire, has further heightened hopes that the increase in incidence of the disease in the country is slowing down. "... the Kailahun district has recorded zero infection for several weeks," Mr Squire declared. Sierra Leone has recorded the highest number of Ebola cases of the 3 most-affected countries that also included Liberia and Guinea.

The latest case numbers (deaths) reported by WHO aer as follows: Sierra Leone 8356 cases (2085 deaths), Liberia 7797 (3290) and Guinea 2416 (1525), with a total of 6915 lives lost in the 3 countries as well as in Mali, Nigeria and the USA...

[3] Sierra Leone: 1st conviction under Ebola laws
Date: Wed 24 Dec 2014
Source: Daily Mail, AFP (Agence France-Presse) report [edited]
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2885838/First-conviction-Sierra-Leone-Ebola-laws.html


1st conviction under Ebola laws
-------------------------------
A village chief has become the 1st person in Sierra Leone to be jailed under laws aimed at preventing the spread of the Ebola virus, court officials and lawyers said. Amadu Kargbo was sentenced to 6 months in jail by a court in the south western city of Moyamba for secretly burying the dead and failing to report a sick patient, court official Foday Fofanah told AFP. He was also fined one million leones (USD 235) and ordered to spend 21 days in quarantine before going to jail.

Lawyers in the capital Freetown said it was the 1st known conviction under the country's Ebola laws. Fofanah said the chief had pleaded guilty to secretly burying his daughter, who had died of Ebola. He added that Kargbo's wife had also died after attending the funeral of another family member, although it was not clear if any of the charges related to his wife's death and burial...

Authorities have banned public gatherings as well as New Year celebrations as part of sweeping efforts to stem the spread of the virus...

[4] Sierra Leone: untested Ebola drug given to patients causes UK walkout

Untested Ebola drug given to patients in Sierra Leone causes UK walkout
---------------------------------------------------------------
A 14-strong team of British doctors, nurses and paramedics stopped working at the Lakka treatment centre in Freetown because of their concerns over what they considered the experimental and potentially dangerous use of the drug, and other safety issues. The 22-bed treatment centre is run by Emergency, an Italian NGO set up by heart surgeon Gino Strada to bring world-class cardiac surgery to some of the poorest parts of Africa. Emergency has stopped using the drug, amiodarone, after a request from DfID [Department for International Development], which had been alerted by the British medics. It says it [the Italian NGO?] is planning a formal trial.

Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, which is funding drug trials starting in West Africa, said "I think it is reckless not doing this in carefully controlled conditions." Farrar believes it is vital that well set-up clinical trials should be carried out in the epidemic to discover treatments that work.

A paper published this week in the journal Emerging Microbes & Infections found 53 drugs that had an antiviral effect against Ebola. Amiodarone was not on the list. One of the authors, Prof Adolfo Garcia-Sastre, director of the Global Health and Emerging Pathogens Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, said amiodarone failed to make the cut. Although it did have an antiviral effect, "it was slightly less potent than the final 53 compounds selected"...

A 4th member of the UN mission in Liberia, the country hardest-hit by the Ebola epidemic, has been hospitalised after testing positive for the virus. "This is the 4th case of Ebola in the mission and UNMIL [United Nations Mission in Liberia] personnel continue to mourn the deaths of 2 colleagues who died from the disease only 3 months ago," a UN statement said on Wednesday [24 Dec 2014]. The UN member tested positive on Tuesday [23 Dec 2014] and was immediately transferred to an Ebola treatment unit, Karin Landgren, the special representative of UN chief Ban Ki-moon said. "UNMIL is taking all necessary measures to mitigate any possible further transmission -- both within the mission and beyond," Landgren said...

Sierra Leone: declares Ebola lockdown in north
----------------------------------------------
Date: Tue 23 Dec 2014
Source: Daily Mail, AFP report [edited]
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2886548/Sierra-Leone-declares-five-day-Ebola-lockdown-north.html


The Sierra Leone government on Wednesday [24 Dec 2014] declared a 5-day lockdown in the country's north to step up efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic, while making an exception for Christmas. "Muslims and Christians are not allowed to hold services in mosques and churches throughout the lockdown except for Christians on Christmas Day (Thu 25 Dec 2014)," Alie Kamara, resident minister for the Northern Region, told AFP. The lockdown is designed "to intensify the containment of the Ebola virus," he said, adding: "We are working to break the chain of transmission." Deputy communication minister Theo Nicol said "The lockdown for 5 days ... is meant for us to get an accurate picture of the situation," adding: "Other districts will carry on with their own individual lockdown after this if they deemed it necessary."...

Sierra Leone bans Christmas parties amid Ebola
----------------------------------------------
Date: Wed 24 Dec 2014
Source: The Washington Post, Associated Press report [edited]
http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/sierra-leone-bans-christmas-parties-amid-ebola/2014/12/24/92f92f4a-8b9c-11e4-ace9-47de1af4c3eb_story.html


The deadly Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone means no festive parties at the beach, no carolers singing at night. Authorities this year have banned any activities that could further the spread of the highly contagious virus now blamed for killing more than 7000 people in West Africa over the past year. "We will stay at home glued to our radio and television sets for broadcast of Christian services and prayers for the country, especially for the speedy end to the deadly Ebola disease early in the New Year..."

Faith is important in this country with a sizeable Christian population still recovering from a brutal civil war that ended more than a decade ago. It's not uncommon to see Biblical verses painted on public transport buses. Now Ebola is spreading fastest in Sierra Leone's Western Area, which includes the capital of Freetown. It's believed that more than half of all new cases come from this part of the country, and authorities fear those infected but not yet symptomatic could unwittingly spread it to other parts of the country if people travel to their rural hometowns as is common over the Christmas holidays.

So the government is restricting travel between districts during the holidays. People will be allowed to attend church on Christmas Day, but "are requested to return home immediately after church services," President Ernest Bai Koroma has said. Public gatherings at restaurants, nightclubs and beaches are banned. And markets are being asked to cut back their hours, reducing the amount of time people have to buy Christmas presents...

Uganda: experimental Ebola vaccines are ruled safe
--------------------------------------------------

Source: Telegraph [edited]
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/ebola/11309558/Experimental-Ebola-vaccines-are-ruled-safe.html


The 1st trial of filovirus vaccines in Africa has a positive response
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Two experimental DNA vaccines to prevent filoviruses, Ebola virus and Marburg viruses, are safe. The 1st trial of filovirus vaccines in Africa, published in The Lancet, shows a similar immune response in healthy Ugandan adults as reported in healthy Americans earlier this year [2014]. Dr Julie Ledgerwood, of the US National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), said: "This is the 1st study to show comparable safety and protection of an experimental Ebola vaccine in an African population.

"This is particularly encouraging because those at greatest risk of Ebola live primarily in Africa, and diminished vaccine protection in African populations has been seen for other diseases." Scientists from the NIAID developed the DNA vaccines that code for Ebola virus proteins from the Zaire and Sudan strains and the Marburg virus protein. The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa involves the Zaire strain.

Dr Saranya Sridhar, of the Jenner Institute, Oxford, said: "The international response to the present Ebola outbreak is an example of the speed and purpose with which clinical vaccine development can progress. "This study is the 1st step on the aspirational road towards the deployment of filovirus vaccines in Africa and must serve to shake the metaphorical cobwebs that can stall our advance towards this destination."...

Ill doctor recently returned from West Africa tests negative for Ebola: health officials
----------------------------------------------------------------
A doctor who returned to the US from one of the Ebola-stricken West African countries Sunday [21 Dec 2014] has tested negative for the virus at Bellevue Hospital, health officials say. The ill doctor was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his travel history, Bellevue Hospital and the city health department said. He had no contact with any Ebola patients while overseas, and did not show any symptoms of Ebola or any other sickness when he returned. It's not clear what country he had visited. Health officials say an alternative diagnosis has been confirmed, and the doctor remains at Bellevue in critical condition.

USA: airport screening for Ebola amid holiday rush
--------------------------------------------------
Date: Tue 23 Dec 2014
Source: The Daily Signal [edited]
http://dailysignal.com/2014/12/23/amid-holiday-travel-rush-officials-keep-eye-1700-ebola/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [US CDC] continues to screen passengers flying into the US for Ebola, even amid the Holiday rush. Travelers entering the US from the 4 West African countries affected by Ebola: Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Mali, continue to [be routed] through 5 airports: Washington Dulles International [Virginia], Chicago O'Hare [Illinois], John F Kennedy in New York, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta [Georgia], and Newark Liberty [New Jersey].

Officials with Customs and Border Protection 1st isolate travelers coming from these countries and conduct a screening that includes a questionnaire and contact form. Individuals also have their temperatures taken. Eight passengers were taken to medical facilities for additional screening, according to data compiled by the Department of Homeland Security. In most cases where symptoms of Ebola are present, Nordlund said, patients may test positive for the flu or malaria instead. Once individuals leave the airport, it becomes the responsibility of state and local officials at their destination to continue to monitor them.

Local and state health officials actively monitor about 1700 persons for symptoms of Ebola, although the number fluctuates daily as travelers move in and out of the 21-day monitoring window. The total number being monitored is not published on [CDC's] website, Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the CDC in Atlanta, said. Some have presented symptoms such as fever, but none has tested positive for Ebola.

Even though media coverage of the Ebola outbreak has quieted down, as Sharyl Attkisson, senior independent contributor to The Daily Signal, noted in an interview Sunday, infectious disease experts still worry about Ebola and the possibility of it spreading to the United States.
