TYPHOID FEVER - ALGERIA
=======================

22 January 1996
An outbreak of typhoid fever was reported in Ain Taya
(around 45,000 inhabitants), 20 km east of Algiers, in
January. By 10 January, 910 suspected cases had been reported; over
80% of them have been confirmed. Laboratory confirmation was
requested in case of unclear clinical diagnosis. One suspected case
died at home.
The epidemic has declined from 92 new cases per day
at the peak to about 20 new cases per day around 10 January, and is
now fully under control. The village has adequate primary health
care service backed up by the infectious disease hospital El-Kettar
in Algiers. Two local and one central multisectoral crisis centres
have been established to control the epidemic. The outbreak was
caused by sewage water contaminating the water reservoirs after a
sewage pipe had been damaged during construction work.
