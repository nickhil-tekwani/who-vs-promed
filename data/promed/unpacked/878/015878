Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis - Brazil (Mato Grosso Do Sul)
Because of a report of cases of bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), which is
difficult to distinguish clinically from foot-&-mouth disease (FMD), 250
000 cattle in the townships of Sete Quedas, Paranhos, Coronel Sapucaia and
Aral Moreira, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, are being
vaccinated against FMD.
In addition, the Brazilian agricultural authorities have decided to
coordinate with those from Paraguay, at a meeting to be held on 31 Aug
2004, to form a frontier commission to monitor animal health.

[Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular vulvovaginitis
(IBR/IPV), caused by bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV1). IBR, generally a disease
of cattle, is one of the differentials for clinical signs that may be seen
in animals suspected of having foot and mouth disease. There are laboratory
tests to distinguish between them.
IBR is an OIE List B disease commonly evidenced either clinically or
serologically in most European and many American countries.
Clinical signs of the disease are those associated with the upper
respiratory tract, such as a (muco)purulent nasal discharge, and by
conjunctivitis. Signs of general illness are fever, depression,
inappetence, abortions and reduced milk yield. The virus can also infect
the genital tract and cause pustular vulvovaginitis and balanoposthitis.
Mortality is low. Many infections run a subclinical course. Secondary
bacterial infections can lead to more severe respiratory disease. - Mod.TG]
