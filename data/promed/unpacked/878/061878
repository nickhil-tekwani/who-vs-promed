Southern Ontario poultry farm quarantined
----------------------------------------
A poultry farm in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, has been placed under
quarantine, after 2 employees became ill, and dozens of birds were found dead.
2 farmers became violently ill Tuesday [20 Jul 2004] morning, at about the
same time approximately 60 dead ducks were discovered on the farm.
Fearing a possible avian flu outbreak, federal, provincial, and municipal
health officials responded quickly, isolating the farm behind signs that
read "Do Not Enter Biosecurity In Effect."
Reporting from the farm, CFTO reporter Alicia Kay-Markson said even though
officials discount the possibility they've discovered a deadly avian flu
strain, the dead birds are being thoroughly tested in a Guelph laboratory.
Ontario Public Safety Commissioner Dr. James Young told CTV's Toronto
affiliate that initial tests already indicate avian flu is not a factor.
"All of our testing at the farm would indicate that the problem there is
not infectious in nature, and is unrelated to avian flu," Young said. "We
are still taking precautions, as the tests are done to be absolutely certain."
Instead, officials are investigating the possibility a malfunction in the
ventilation system caused a toxic buildup of ammonia that killed the birds,
and, made the workers sick.
There have been 2 human cases of avian flu infection in British Columbia,
Canada. That strain of bird flu was not the same one that has killed 24
people, and, led to the cull of 100 million birds across Asia.

consistent with avian influenza. A build-up of ammonia does, however,
appear to be more likely. - Mod.TG]
