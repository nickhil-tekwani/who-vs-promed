Uganda bans dairy products to protect against BSE
-------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan government has banned the import of all dairy products to stop
the possible entry of the disease BSE, according to the agency AFP.
"We have with immediate effect banned the importation of all dairy products
to guard against Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy -- or mad cow disease --
from getting here," said William Olaho Mukani, the head of animal resources
in the Agriculture and Animal Industry Ministry. Mukani explained that the
government was keen to keep the products out of Uganda, even those sneaked
in through smuggling.
The Kampala government spends a huge amount of money on animal vaccination
and drugs and wanted the spread of diseases halted, officials said.
During 2004, the government banned the importation of animal semen after
mad cow diseases ravaged other parts of the world amid fears that the
ailment would spread to humans.

[Confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the above import ban will be appreciated.
According to the prevailing text of article 2.3.13.1. in OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code, milk, milk products, and bovine semen are excluded from
any BSE-related conditions on their import or transit, regardless of the
BSE status of the cattle population of the exporting country or zone. These
provisions are based upon the currently available scientific information. -
