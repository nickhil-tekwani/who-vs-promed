ACUTE PULMONARY-RENAL SYNDROME - SAUDI ARABIA (MECCA)

From: Koen de Blok <k.deblok@amc.uva.nl>

A 68 year old male, born in Morocco and living for many years in the
Netherlands, was admitted 3 days ago with acute renal failure in
combination with an interstitial pneumonitis with pulmonary hemorrhage.
He visited Mecca in the period between 14 and 4 days prior to admission to
our hospital. Today he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit because
of progressive respiratory failure and shock. Hemodialysis was started 8
days ago.
Ultrasound of the kidneys showed two large dense kidneys (12 cm).
Laboratory investigation showed signs of acute renal failure, leucocytosis
(16 x 10E6 /ml), no thrombocytopenia, no marked liver enzyme disturbance or
hyper-bilirubinemia.
Serological investigation for vasculitis is under investigation. Sputum
investigation is still not conclusive. We are now running further
diagnostic tests for Legionella, leptospirosis, atypical respiratory
infections as well as on hantavirus or hantavirus-related infection.
This patient is probably the second index patient. The other patient with
an identical clinical picture was admitted to the ICU [Intensive Care Unit]
of another hospital in Amsterdam. No bacteriological or viral diagnosis
could be made so far. This patient also became ill, during a very recent
visit to Mecca, and his condition deteriorated in the same way as our
patient.
We have a very high suspicion of an infectious disease, although the
clinical picture does not completely fit a specific disease.

[There are apparently no hemorrhagic symptoms. We would be interested to
see the differential diagnosis from GIDEON. - Mod.JW]
