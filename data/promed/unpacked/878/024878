A hospital in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, has closed after 16 staff
members contracted an unidentified disease. The outbreak at the private
Hanoi French Hospital caused employees to suffer fevers, headaches and
violent coughing fits.
The World Health Organisation says there is no danger to the population in
general. WHO says it is working with the health ministry. The focus of the
investigation is a 50-year-old American businessman who was the first to be
affected. He is currently receiving treatment in Hong Kong.

[ProMED would appreciate further information on this strange outbreak. I
wonder how WHO Hanoi can be so sure it won't spread. - Mod.JW]
