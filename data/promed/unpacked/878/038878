Trainers whose horses have raced at 3 recent Melbourne meetings have been advised to monitor their horses for clinical signs of strangles after a clerk of the course's horse was confirmed with the infectious disease.

Buddy, ridden by Shane Patterson, worked at Caulfield on 15 Jul 2017 and Flemington last Saturday. Fellow clerk of the course horse Brian, who is stabled with Buddy, was on duty at Sandown on 29 Jul 2017.

Racing Victoria stewards were notified on Tuesday [25 Jul 2017] that Buddy was showing clinical signs consistent with strangles with the diagnosis confirmed on Thursday [27 Jul 2017].

The stewards have advised Patterson that no horses are allowed to leave his stables, which are located off-course in Flemington, until approval is granted by RV [Racing Vet].

At this time, no restrictions or conditions have been placed on any other stable.

Strangles is an infectious bacterial condition that is transmitted via direct contact between individual horses and/or through indirect contact in several ways.

Strangles usually causes upper respiratory tract disease but can also affect the lungs. It is highly contagious, although rarely fatal.

Trainers have been asked to monitor all horses' temperatures in their stables twice a day, which is vital, as nasal shedding of the bacteria (which could spread the disease) typically occurs 2 to 3 days after the onset of fever.

["Strangles is caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_). The bacteria typically infect the upper airway and lymph nodes of the head and neck.

The hallmark clinical signs of infection are fever (temperature over 101.5 F [38 C]), nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes (in the space between the lower jaw bones), which ultimately abscess. This is a highly contagious bacterial infection, generally treated by antibiotics and rest. Therefore, isolation of those barns is appropriate to contain the disease, as is close attention to the animal's temperature."
