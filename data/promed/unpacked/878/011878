This thread has attracted as much reader response as other topics
marginal to this list such as St Vitus' dance did. Nick Komar &
Jennifer Marino suggest that bulls may attract 2000 bites per min. or
more. Others have corrected my arithmetic. Keath Marx/Maggie Roston
suggest stress, exhaustion and injection of foreign protein by the bites
as cause of death. Roberta Webb suggests severe histamine reaction,
based on the drastic personal experience of being badly bitten, even on
the eyeballs, and going into convulsions.
IÂ´m afraid that my (erroneous) calculations of the number of bites
needed to drain 30L of blood from a bull have led some readers to
believe this is a simple statistical calculation.
What we have not had are any of the following comments:
- the attractiveness of a mammalian host for mosquitoes is not a simple
function of exposed surface area, and in any case, surface area is not
directly proportional to weight
- mosquitoes prefer less hairy, thinner areas of skin on hairy animals,
such as the nostrils, ears, 'armpits' & 'groin', and around the eyes and
anus, so they will not distribute themselves evenly over the body
surface, i.e. landing area will be limited
- histamine reaction will knock an animal down fast, protecting the
relatively hairless underparts
- mosquitoes have diurnal feeding cycles, do not feed around the clock
like bovines do
- surface capillaries will shut down long before blood volume is reduced
by even 25 percent, meaning mosquitoes will no longer be able to tap
into the circulation
- the substances in mosquito saliva that dilate capillaries to
facilitate feeding may have the opposite effect when injected in excess
- whether post mortem tests for mosquito peptides or histamine have been
done, or pathology indicating toxic reactions has been found.
There are doubtless other complications also. I lean toward some kind of
fatal allergic reaction to mosquito saliva, rather than fatal blood
loss. I now declare this thread cut -- unless Martin, who has been
away, wishes to add a final word.
