Measles virus genotype D8
----------------------------------
Measles genotype D8, the genotype found in The Netherlands outbreak
described below [Measles, anthroposophic community - The Netherlands:
(The Hague) 20080731.2353] and noted to not be associated with recent
European outbreaks, was the genotype associated with the March-May
2008 measles outbreak in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada
[see ProMED-mail references below].

[Dr. Taha's observation may suggest a link between the index case in
The Netherlands outbreak in an anthroposophic community in the Hague
and the Toronto area in Canada. A recent survey of the diversity of
measles viruses in the European Region indicated that the D8 genotype
was rare [see: "High genetic diversity of measles virus, World Health
Organization European Region, 2005-2006." By J.R. Krem et al., Emerg
Infect Dis. 2008 Jan;14(1):107-14.
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/1/107.htm>).

According to this survey during the period 2005-2006, 9 measles virus
genotypes were identified throughout the World Health Organization
European Region. All major epidemics were associated with genotypes
D4, D6, and B3. Other genotypes (B2, D5, D8, D9, G2, and H1) were
only found in limited numbers of cases after importation from other
continents. The genetic diversity of endemic D6 strains was low;
genotypes C2 and D7, circulating in Europe until recent years, were
no longer identified. The transmission chains of several indigenous
MV strains may thus have been interrupted by enhanced vaccination.
However, multiple importations from Africa and Asia and virus
introduction into highly mobile and unvaccinated communities caused a
massive spread of D4 and B3 strains throughout much of the region.
Thus, despite the reduction of endemic measles virus circulation,
importation of measles virus from other continents caused prolonged
circulation and large outbreaks after their introduction into
unvaccinated and highly mobile communities.

These observations thus provide evidence for the endemic circulation
of genotype D6 in Europe at least during the past 15 years. Measles
cases in the European Region associated with other genotypes were
mostly due to virus importation from other continents In addition to
D6, D4, and B3, some other genotypes (B2, D5, D8, D9, G3, H1) were
found in Europe during 2005-2006. Most of them were associated with
sporadic cases or small outbreaks after importation of measles virus
from other continents. Some D8 cases have been considered to be the
result of introductions from India. Historically there have been
contacts between religious communities in Canada and The Netherlands
and it is not inconceivable that the Dutch index case may have
acquired infection from a Canadian source, rather than an Asia source.

A map of the distribution of measles virus genotypes up to 2006 can
be found in the Weekly Epidemiological Record, No. 51/52, 2006, 81,
469-48.

[There is a significant anthroposophic Netherlands community residing
in Ontario Canada with regular travellers between the communities in
Ontario and those in the Netherlands. The community in Ontario have
historically refused vaccination for their children in keeping with
their 'sister' communities in the Netherlands. Given the mention of a
similar virus involved in a measles outbreak in both the Netherlands
and Ontario Canada, that perhaps the outbreak in Ontario may well
have had connections with the outbreak in the Netherlands (but this
is speculation and not based on genetic studies of the involved
viruses).

This moderator is reminded of the outbreak of polio in the
Netherlands among this anthroposophic community back in 1978/1979.
At that time there were related cases in Canada -- Ontario and
British Columbia were involved. At that time there were an estimated
80 000 members of this community in the Netherlands, with satellite
communities in Canada (mostly in Ontario and BC), and in the USA.
These communities were traced and vaccination practices were looked
at. In the Netherlands there was almost uniform rejection of
vaccination with religious leaders supporting the rejection of
vaccination. In Canada, there was a high level of non-vaccination,
but when approached, the religious leaders agreed to be quiet on the
topic, and some of the family members did agree to vaccinate their
children against polio after the introduction of wild poliovirus in
the communities. In the USA, the overwhelming majority of the
communities were vaccinating their children and their religious
leaders had agreed to "look the other way" vis a vis their
congregants practices. One suspects that members of the community
that lived in the rural areas back in the late 1970s may well have
migrated to communities closer to Toronto during the years and may
well have been involved in the outbreak, or at least in the original
importation of the virus and original circulation. - Mod.MPP]
