I am writing to request expert assistance for an outbreak of one of
the fatal zoonotic diseases, leptospirosis, in Sri Lanka. Presently a
total of 10 000 cases have been reported and nearly 500 people have
died.

I do not have exact data island-wide but within the Peradeniya
Teaching hospital [near Kandy, see map link below. - Mod.JW] there
were 120 cases and out of those, 12 patients have died. Our health
officials are seeking expert help to identify the reservoir animals,
transmission, and control of this epidemic episode. In this connection
we need urgent assistance to control this
problem.

Therefore, could you please find any resource with whom to
communicate in this matter and formulate an urgent program as well as
a future long-term program to control this problem?

Another problem we have is that our farmers are reluctant to do
cultivation work due to this situation.

In this connection, Professor SAM Kularatne, Professor of Medicine,
and Dr KR Siyambalagoda, Director, Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, are
conducting a study in the Medical Faculty in Peradeniya. I will ask
them to communicate regarding this matter if we can get any
assistance.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Rajapakse for this information and is glad to
post this to help in facilitating assistance. Below is the only
material that this Moderator was able to find regarding this large
outbreak of leptospirosis.

Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by one of the many pathogenic
serotypes of the spirochete _Leptospira_. It is transmitted to humans
by exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes to water or wet soil
(such as after flooding due to heavy rainfall) that has been
contaminated by urine from asymptomatic chronically infected animals,
especially rodents but also large farm animals. The disease is likely
often under-diagnosed because of the non-specific initial clinical
presentation and difficulties in laboratory diagnosis. The incubation
period is about one to 2 weeks after exposure.

The initial symptoms are abrupt onset of chills, fever, myalgias,
most prominently in the calves and back, cough, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and headache. Conjunctival suffusion and muscle tenderness
may characteristically occur. A 2nd phase of the disease may occur
after a short period of relative well-being that is thought to result
from an immunologic response to the infection and presents with
aseptic meningitis, myocarditis with arrhythmias, hemorrhagic
pneumonia, uveitis, nephritis, and hepatitis. More than 90 percent of
patients have a self-limited illness, but some develop a more severe
illness with renal and hepatic failure (Weil's disease) that may be
fatal in 5-40 percent. - Mod.LL]

The number of cases of the waterborne disease leptospirosis, known as
"Mee Una" or 'rat fever' in common parlance, has increased in Sri
Lanka.

Sources at the Health Ministry's Epidemiology Department said 41
persons have died due to the disease in the 1st quarter of 2008. The
most number of patients detected as suffering from leptospirosis have
been found from the Matara District. Affected persons were also
detected from Gampaha and Kegalle districts.

Provincial director, Health Services Department of Matara District,
Dr Indika Ranasinghe said they have 250 leptospirosis cases from the
Matara District. "The outbreak of leptospirosis is alarming in the
district, and is at serious proportions with the number of patients
increasing," Dr Ranasinghe said.

The exposure to the disease occurs due to contact with the water or
mud contaminated by the urine of rats and other animals, he said. The
incidence is highest among the [rice] paddy farmers, he said. "Three
farmers affected with the disease died at the Matara General Hospital
no sooner than they came for treatment as they have not taken medicine
at the early occurrence of its symptoms," he said.

Asked if the provincial authorities had taken any action to prevent
the disease from spreading, Dr Ranasinghe said they have advised the
public not to drink stagnant water in rivers and lakes in a number of
awareness programs. "We have also advised them to take clinical
treatment at the earliest occurrence of any fever symptoms," he said.

Leptospirosis characteristically occurs during rainy weather or
flooding associated with wet weather. Between 1000 to 2000 patients
are admitted to hospitals to take medication for rat fever on a
yearly basis.
