Ovine rinderpest [see comment] commonly known as peste des petits ruminants (PPR) or sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants. Once introduced, the virus can infect up to 90 percent of an animal herd, and the disease kills anywhere from 30 to 70 percent of infected animals. The PPR virus does not infect humans.

Unfortunately, the infectious disease casualties in Taleqan [county] amounted to 15, so far, Fardin Hakimi, chief of the Alborz province department of environment (DOE) said [see comment below].

"Due to the fact that wildlife is moving and not staying in their habitats, there is a possibility of transmission and spread of the disease among wildlife and livestock even in other provinces," he warned.

Hakimi went on to say that a meeting was held on controlling the disease chaired by the head of National Disaster Management Organization, and the representatives of the Red Crescent Society, the Plan and Budget Organization, and other related officials, in attendance.

"Currently, experts and DOE's forces are conducting surveys in the infected region," he said, adding that livestock are being moved out of the region, in addition to being vaccinated.

Rangers in the area are identifying contaminated areas, burning carcasses of infected animals and disinfecting the lands and watering troughs, he highlighted.

The disease is expected to spread among other wildlife populations of Alborz province and Taleqan county, he regretted, adding, in this regard, it is necessary to take urgent measures to contain the disease and preventive measures must be taken at the regions which are yet to be infected with the disease.

"We call on all responsible bodies, environmentalists and locals to help control the disease and reduce the mortality rate," he concluded.

Earlier in July [2018], another outbreak of [PPR] occurred in the southeastern province of Kerman, killing some 50 heads of rams and wild goats.

Moreover, Siamak Masoudi, head of wildlife diseases office of the DOE said that the disease was first spotted in Iran in (1997-2000), following the smuggling of domestic livestock to the country, taking the lives of 1200 heads of precious wild ruminants, over the past few years.

According to World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), standard disease control measures consisting of quarantine, movement control, sanitary slaughter, and cleaning and disinfection should be applied to prevent or control the disease. The virus is susceptible to most disinfectants. There are no medications available to treat the disease, but supportive treatment may decrease mortality. A vaccine is used where the disease is established and it provides good immunity.

["Ovine rinderpest" is one of several synonyms of PPR. The others are pseudorinderpest, goat plague, pest of small ruminants, pest of sheep and goats, kata, stomatitis-pneumoenteritis syndrome, and pneumoenteritis complex. Its causative pathogen is Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), a member of the genus _Morbillivirus_ in the family Paramyxoviridae. Four genetic lineages (lineages 1-4) and a number of viral strains have been identified. Lineage 4 viruses have become especially prevalent in recent years. PPRV is closely related to rinderpest virus, which has been globally eradicated. Subscribers are referred to a review at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/peste_des_petits_ruminants.pdf, which includes also an extensive list of PPR-susceptible wildlife species.

PPR is endemic in Iran's livestock since the 1990's of the previous century, circulating throughout the country. The media report above addresses its impact upon the health of wild sheep and goats in Taleqan county, in Iran's Alborz province, some 100 km (62 mi) north west to Tehran (see map at https://goo.gl/maps/mv5LEFK7KHL2). It mentions earlier cases in such animals in July 2018 in the Kerman province, some 500 km (311 mi) south east to Tehran (map at https://goo.gl/maps/Cm2oZp8iic82).

In 2014-2016, more than 1000 wild goats and sheep in 4 northern and central provinces of Iran died from PPR virus infection. Partial nucleoprotein sequencing of PPRV from 3 animals showed a close relationship to lineage 4 strains from China; see article, with map, at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367395/.

Since its initial identification in Cote d'Ivoire in 1942, PPR has spread to over 70 countries in Africa, the Near and Middle East, and Asia and has reached new areas in recent years. In December 2016 the 1st reported outbreak in sheep and goats with spillover of the disease to a wild antelope species was observed in Mongolia, and later in June 2018, it reached the European Union, with a 1st-ever case reported in Bulgaria.

An ambitious plan to globally eradicate PPR by 2030 was launched by OIE and FAO in 2015; during the 2nd week of September 2018, the delegates of more than 45 PPR-infected countries, and many relevant institutions, convened in Brussels to reaffirm this international political engagement and encourage resource partners to join the fight against the disease (see at https://tinyurl.com/y8eu282b).
