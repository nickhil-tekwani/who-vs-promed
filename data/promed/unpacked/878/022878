A farm which was under restrictions after 2 cows died of anthrax has
been given the all-clear. Restrictions ended at Ynys Gau farm, at
Gwaelod-y-Garth, near Cardiff, 20 days after its last anthrax death.
The herd has been closely monitored and there have been no further
cases.
Experts have ruled out an external source and believe it is due to a
ground source. The farm also tested positive for anthrax 35 years ago.
The public had been banned from going on or near the farm and the
movement of animals was halted. Footpaths crossing the farm were
closed for 3 weeks. The risk to users of the public rights of way and
pets following the lifting of restrictions is minimal, said Wales'
chief vet, Christianne Glossop. Restrictions on movement of animals
on and off the farm were introduced on 19 Apr 2006, with people also
barred from going near the land.
Dr Glossop said officials had concluded that restrictions could be
lifted from Friday. "I am sure the farmer affected will be very glad
to be able to resume his normal business and we have given him advice
and directions on how to manage the field which we believe to be the
source of the outbreak," she said.
The anthrax was discovered following the sudden deaths of 6 cows at
Ynys Gau farm. Farmers are required to report the sudden and
unexpected death of livestock, and routine testing revealed 2 of the
cows had died of anthrax. The carcasses of the 2 animals with anthrax
were incinerated on the farm. The other 4 animals were incinerated
elsewhere, with the workers there advised of health and safety
procedures.
The risk to users of the local river had been described as
"negligible," while the danger to walkers and their paths after
restrictions were lifted would be "minimal".
In 1971, 7 animals died from anthrax at Ynys Gau.
The last case of the disease in Britain was in 2002 when a cow died
at a farm in Wrexham, north Wales.

[It is unfortunate that -- in the absence of any other 'proof' -- the
default in livestock anthrax is to ascribe it to some previous
outbreak on the farm. And as the UK at one time had some 350-450
outbreaks each year thanks to contaminated bone meal, it can
sometimes be hard to find a farm where there isn't a memory of a
previous outbreak. The reality? Who knows? But when such Lazarus
sites can be truly demonstrated, it is usually as a result of some
earth-moving activity, trenching, ditch digging/clearing, bulldozing,
or flood erosion. One must presume that the Welsh Veterinary Officers
found no history of that activity as it isn't mentioned. Another
contributory factor would be whether or not the 7 animals in 1971
were incinerated on or off the farm, or just buried with or without
lime. This should be in the 1971 MAFF files if they still exist. If
one or more animals had been buried -- and especially if one had been
necropsied -- that would be more persuasive of a grave source. If the
1971 carcasses had not been opened, the post-mortem drop in pH would
have been lethal for the vegetative organisms within the carcasses.
When one has a 'champs maudit', i.e. a pasture with a history of
repeated outbreaks, other than vaccinating any stock grazing it, the
best option is to use it for grain crops and neither hay nor winter
forage, as these can be contaminated with soil.
Walkers are at zero risk from any putatively contaminated soil. At
this point it is all in the mind, whatever may be on your boots. -
