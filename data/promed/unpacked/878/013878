[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. ASF is believed to have evolved in a sylvatic cycle that occurs in eastern and southern Africa between common warthogs (_Phacochoerus africanus_) and argasid ticks of the _Ornithodoros moubata_ complex that share their burrows. But the tick is not necessary for the ASF virus transmission. Pigs in the acute stage of infection develop high viremia and shed large amounts of virus in various secretions and excretions. The virus can tolerate a wide range of temperature and pH. Pigs can become infected through direct contact with infected pigs or materials contaminated by infected pigs and eating uncooked meat products derived from infected pigs, as well as when infected _Ornithodoros_ ticks feed on them. The importance of wildlife reservoirs for disease maintenance has been clearly demonstrated. In many parts of Eurasia, the disease spread into the local wild boar populations. - Mod.PMB
