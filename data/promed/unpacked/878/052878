Life in Denmark now feels so much like it did before the pandemic that it can put visitors on edge, says Lone Simonsen, an epidemiologist at Roskilde University. The country lifted all of its remaining coronavirus restrictions on 10 Sep 2021. Copenhagen clubs are buzzing, music lovers flock to festivals, and buses are packed with unmasked commuters. The government has given up its power to close schools and shut down the country. "When we have guests now, they feel uncomfortable about how normal everything is," Simonsen says.

Denmark is a pioneer. As the 2nd coronavirus winter approaches in the Northern Hemisphere, Denmark and a few other countries where vaccines now protect a large percentage of the population from severe disease are entering a momentous transition: from pandemic to endemic COVID-19, when the virus is still there but ceases to be an overriding public health threat. Researchers are closely watching what happens next because it could yield valuable information about what lies ahead for the rest of the world.

There are many unknowns: how best to manage the transition out of the public health crisis, how it might go wrong, and exactly what endemicity will look like once it arrives. "Going into a pandemic is hard enough, coming out of it is even harder," says Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease researcher who leads the Wellcome Trust. "We don't just go from a no-vaccine state and horror to a status quo. There's a transition phase, and I think that will be this winter."

Denmark has fully vaccinated more than 88% of people older than 18 and an astonishing 97% of those over age 60, the group most vulnerable to serious COVID-19. That allows the country to try to treat SARS-CoV-2 like influenza and other infectious diseases instead of a threat to the entire health system. "We're thinking of this virus now as a sort of defanged version of the original one. It has gotten its teeth pulled out by the vaccine," Simonsen says. "What's left is not much worse than diseases that we're used to and that we don't close schools for, like seasonal flu or maybe the 2009 influenza pandemic."

That does not mean Denmark is out of the woods. There are still susceptible people, including children, adolescents who aren't yet fully vaccinated, and people in whom the vaccines have not elicited sufficient immunity. Since the measures were dropped, case numbers in Denmark have been slowly rising -- there were 542 yesterday [29 Sep 2021] -- ending a long summer lull. Simonsen is not alarmed. The continuing spread will result in more natural immunity in unvaccinated children and adults, and vaccine coverage will keep inching upward, she says. "All of this together makes me think Denmark will reach herd immunity in the spring."

Four recently published projections from the Statens Serum Institute (SSI), a governmental public health and research agency, provide some idea of what might happen between now and then. In the best-case scenario, the country reaches 90% vaccination coverage among those over age 12 and there is no increase in social activities, currently still below the prepandemic level; then no surge in cases and hospitalizations is expected, says SSI modeler Camilla Holten Moller. In the worst-case scenario -- no further increase in vaccine uptake and a 10% rise in social activities -- Denmark could see a wave in cases and hospitalizations as bad as those in December 2020 and January. "We do not expect [that] to happen," Holten Moller says, but if it did the government would likely bring back some restrictions. "The key is to be ready to change one's mind as the data come out," says Rustom Antia, an immunologist at Emory University.

None of the models included a waning of immunity; Denmark started to give booster shots to vulnerable groups in September [2021] and has said it expects to give the entire population a 3rd dose eventually. The models also didn't include a key wild card: the emergence of nasty new variants of the virus.

Norway, with a similarly high vaccine uptake, followed Denmark's lead last week. But many countries around the world do not have access to enough vaccine to vaccinate even the most vulnerable groups. And even in Europe, awash in vaccine, few countries are as ready as Denmark to attempt this transition. "If you have a lower coverage in the elderly, you should not try to do what Denmark is trying right now," Simonsen says. Spain has vaccinated 97% of residents over age 60, for example, France 81%, and Greece 77%. Israel, which fully reopened on 1 Jun 2021, has double-vaccinated about 90% of its population older than 60, meaning that per capita, it has several times as many unvaccinated people in that vulnerable group as Denmark does. It is now struggling to contain a big new wave of cases.

Countries with lower coverage will have to accept a higher level of restrictions during the transition phase to keep the virus at bay, Farrar says. "I think that politicians across the world are sort of pretending that you can have your cake and eat it: You can have zero deaths, no control measures, vaccinate if you want or not vaccinate -- and it will all end. I just don't think that's realistic."

[2] CIDRAP news
[A] Remdesivir linked to lower COVID-19 mortality
Date: Fri 1 Oct 2021

Hospitalized COVID-19 patients who were treated with remdesivir within 2 days of admission had lower mortality rates than their matched cohort, according to a study today [1 Oct 2021] in Clinical Infectious Diseases (https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab875/6378778). The observational cohort consisted of US adults hospitalized with COVID-19 from August to November 2020; 28 855 received remdesivir and 16 887 did not.

About 10.6% of patients who received remdesivir died within 14 days, and 15.4% died within 28 days, while those who didn't receive remdesivir had 14- and 28-day mortality rates of 15.4% and 19.1%, respectively. The researchers estimate that the antiviral drug reduces risk of death by 24% for 14-day mortality and by 11% at 28 days (95% CIs, 0.70 to 0.83 and 0.82 to 0.96, respectively).

This benefit was also seen across patients with no supplementary oxygen, low-flow oxygen, and invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation treatment for both 14- and 28-day mortality (hazard ratios [HRs] ranged from 0.68-0.70 and 0.77-0.80, respectively). For those who received remdesivir and also needed high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation, risk of death was reduced for 14-day mortality (HR, 0.81) but not 28-day mortality.

"While unmeasured confounding cannot be excluded, these findings provide further support that RDV antiviral therapy is a foundational treatment approach for COVID-19," the researchers conclude.

Remdesivir is the 1st antiviral fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat COVID-19 in critically ill patients, and it has received conditional authorization by the European Medicines Agency. It is not currently approved by the World Health Organization.

["Remdesivir (GS-5734) is an inhibitor of the viral RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase with in vitro inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-1 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [coronavirus] (MERS-CoV). It was identified early as a promising therapeutic candidate for COVID-19 because of its ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. In addition, in nonhuman primate studies, remdesivir initiated 12 hours after inoculation with MERS-CoV reduced lung virus levels and lung damage" (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2007764). - Mod.LK]

People with disabilities reported more willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine but had lower vaccination rates than people without disabilities, according to survey results published in today's [1 Oct 2021] Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR; https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7039a2.htm).

The researchers used data from a randomized telephone survey conducted 30 May to 26 Jun 2021, of which about 9% of 56 749 US adult respondents were considered as having disabilities. Those who had disabilities were more likely to report that they would definitely get vaccinated (age-adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.86) but less likely to have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (aPR, 0.88).

In the same vein, unvaccinated adults with disabilities were more likely to say that the vaccine would offer protection (aPR, 1.29) as well as more likely to say that it would be difficult to get vaccinated (aPR, 2.69). This subgroup cited difficulties around getting an appointment online (aPR, 2.14, vs unvaccinated people without disabilities), not knowing where to get vaccinated (aPR, 1.95), getting to vaccination sites (aPR, 3.43), and vaccination sites not being open at convenient times (aPR, 1.69).

The study notes that 15.2% of adults in the United States had at least one reported functional disability in the 2019 American Community Survey. "Reducing barriers to scheduling and making vaccination sites more accessible might improve vaccination coverage among persons with disabilities," conclude the researchers.

[C] Flu and COVID vaccines

Giving the flu vaccine at the same time as the 2nd dose of the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be safe and induce immunogenicity, according to a non-peer-reviewed study in The Lancet yesterday [30 Sep 2021] (https://ssrn.com/abstract=3931758).

From 1 Apr to 26 Jun 2021, the researchers divided 679 UK adults into 6 cohorts, with each concomitantly receiving their 2nd COVID-19 vaccine dose and either a placebo or one of 3 influenza vaccines (a trivalent, adjuvanted vaccine [aTIV], or a cellular or recombinant quadrivalent vaccine [QIVc or QIVr]). Three weeks later, those who received the placebo received their flu vaccine and vice versa, and total follow-up concluded 6 weeks after that.

The phase IV, blinded, multicenter randomized controlled trial showed non-inferiority among those who received the AstraZeneca and QIVc vaccine (-1.29%), the Pfizer and QIVc vaccine (6.17%), the Pfizer and aTIV vaccine (-12.9%), and the AstraZeneca and QIVr vaccine (2.53%). In the other 2 cohorts, the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI] exceeded 25% by no more than one percentage point.

Reactions were mostly mild or moderate and didn't significantly differ in frequency between those who received the concomitant vaccines and those who didn't (85.2% and 81.7%, respectively).

Similarly, immunogenicity was similar across anti-S immunoglobulin G geometric mean units and seroconversion rates 21 days after the COVID-19 dose. No significant differences were seen in hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) geometric mean titer ratios against any flu strain 21 days after receiving the flu vaccine either concomitantly or alone. (People vaccinated against the flu develop HAI antibodies that bind and neutralize the flu virus.)

"In some parts of the world, COVID-19 and seasonal influenza vaccination programmes will overlap, and so administration of both vaccines at the same appointment, concomitantly, would lessen the burden on healthcare systems, support vaccine uptake and afford timely protection against both infections," the researchers write.

"Our findings demonstrate that concomitant administration of 6 different combinations of COVID-19 and influenza vaccines raises no safety concerns, produces acceptable reactogenicity profiles and preserves immunogenicity."

[3] Merck: antiviral pill (molnupiravir)
Date: Fri 1 Oct 2021
Source: Stat News [edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2021/10/01/mercks-antiviral-pill-reduces-hospitalization-of-covid-patients-a-possible-game-changer-for-treatment


An investigational antiviral pill reduced the chances that patients newly diagnosed with COVID-19 would be hospitalized by about 50%, a finding that could give doctors a desperately needed new way to treat the sick, the drug maker Merck announced Friday [1 Oct 2021]. A 5-day course of molnupiravir, developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, reduced both hospitalization and death compared to a placebo. In the placebo group, 53 patients, or 14.1%, were hospitalized or died. For those who received the drug, 28, or 7.3%, were hospitalized or died.

A simple oral medication to help treat COVID-19 has been an elusive goal since the start of the pandemic. Other drugs, including Gilead's remdesivir, have also been shown to reduce hospitalizations if given early in the course of disease, but must be given intravenously.

"If this pans out, it will change the landscape," said Andy Pavia, chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at University of Utah. "There's still a lot we need to know. What does the side effect profile look like? Do we know how to dose it in populations that are different such as children and the obese? But as a top-line result, this is definitely exciting."

If approved, molnupiravir could have a dramatic impact on efforts to fight the pandemic. Merck and Ridgeback said they would seek an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) "as soon as possible" and would submit it to regulatory agencies worldwide.

The data from the study were made public in a press release and have not yet been peer-reviewed. But even top-line figures were encouraging. In the first 29 days of the study, there were no deaths reported in the group treated with molnupiravir and 8 deaths reported among patients who received placebo.

Patients in the study had mild-to-moderate COVID-19, were within 5 days of symptom onset when dosed, and had at least one risk factor associated with poor disease outcomes. The study was stopped early on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee and in consultation with the FDA, Merck said. Such committees are charged with making sure studies are in the best interest of patients, and recommend they be stopped if it is clear a drug is effective.

Only limited information on side effects was made public in the press release, but the companies said rates were similar between the placebo group and the treated group. An adverse event, or bad outcome, occurred in 35% of those who received molnupiravir and 40% of those who received placebo. Only 1.3% of molnupiravir-treated subjects discontinued the drug because of an adverse event compared with 3.4% who discontinued placebo.

"When people talk about endemic COVID and the future of COVID, they don't spend as much time talking about the value of intervening early to reduce severity of disease and that's a very valuable tool," said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at Emory University who studies infectious disease. "The more accessible that can be, the more effective it can be."

One challenge will be making sure the drug is available when people need it, and one challenge could be price. In June [2021], Merck entered into an agreement to supply the US government 1.7 million courses of the drug for USD 1.2 billion, or USD 700 a course. That price could be out of reach for some countries. But Merck also has said it will enter into licensing agreements with generic drug makers to accelerate the availability of the drug in more than 100 low- and middle-income countries. "We are committed to making sure that there is access to this drug," Daria Hazuda, a Merck vice president, told reporters on a conference call Friday morning [1 Oct 2021].

In an interview, Dean Li, Merck's head of research and development, said that no particular side effect stood out as being more common with the drug, but more complete data will be available at a later date.

Molnupiravir works in a manner different from other antiviral drugs, creating multiple errors in the virus's RNA and impairing its ability to replicate. Because there is not much experience with this mechanism, Pavia said, safety data will need to be scrutinized. He also said he doubted the drug will be used in pregnant people. None were included in the study.

DNA sequencing data on which variant of the SARS-CoV-2 caused COVID-19 were available in 40% of the 81 cases. The drug appeared effective against so-called variants of concern, including the gamma, delta, and mu variants of the virus.

"As you are well aware, it is likely that we're going to see continued evolution of those variants," said Li. "Our prediction from our in vitro studies and now with this data is that molnupiravir is named after the right -- you know, it's named after Thor's hammer [Mjollnir], this is a hammer against SARS-CoV-2 regardless of the variant."

The study had enrolled 90% of the 1500 volunteers it planned to include, but the decision to stop it was based on data from 762 patients. A breakdown on the background, ethnicity, and gender of the participants was not immediately available, but the trial was conducted in countries across the world, including Argentina, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Li said the data monitoring committee met on Tuesday [28 Sep 2021]. He said he was in his kitchen when he received a text message from Roy Baynes, Merck's chief medical officer. He said the results immediately impressed him. "You think of all the people that could benefit from it and all the people that are in your life that you wish could have benefited from it," Li said.

India has reported 26 727 new COVID-19 cases, 13% higher than yesterday [30 Sep 2021], and 277 deaths in a span of 24 hours, the Union health ministry said on Friday [1 Oct 2021]. The current recovery rate is 97.86%, the highest since March 2020, it stated. Out of 26 727 new COVID cases and 277 deaths across India, 15 914 cases and 122 deaths were reported in Kerala in the last 24 hours. With a decline of 1796 active cases, the country's active caseload stands at 275 224, the ministry data showed. Active cases currently account for 1% of the total cases in India.

Meanwhile, 28 246 more people were discharged in the last 24 hours, taking the total recoveries in the country to 33 043 144. Also, 1 520 899 tests were conducted on Thursday [30 Sep 2021], taking the total cumulative tests conducted so far to 570 477 338 the government said.

With only 20% vaccine-eligible people fully vaccinated in Pakistan, mobility is going to become difficult for non-vaccinated people from Friday [1 Oct 2021]. According to data shared by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Thursday [30 Sep 2021], 1742 new cases of COVID-19 and 39 deaths caused by the disease were reported in a single day. The number of active cases was 47 832.

According to decisions of the NCOC, from 1 Oct 2021 only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to stay in the transportation business of students and school-related supplies. Similarly, only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to enter and work in shopping malls. Moreover, only fully vaccinated people would be allowed domestic and international air travel and restriction will be both for inbound and outbound travellers.

However, to become eligible to travel in trains and buses, people will have to be fully vaccinated by 15 Oct 2021. Similarly, only fully vaccinated people would be allowed to travel on highways and motorways after 15 Oct 2021.

Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Health Services, Sajid Shah, told Dawn that vaccine was available and thousands of vaccination centers were open in the country, so people could not be allowed to play with the health of others by remaining unvaccinated.

Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that only fully vaccinated travellers aged 18 and above would be permitted to fly within Pakistan. He said in a tweet: "With effect from [1 Oct 2021], only fully vaccinated passengers of age 18 and above will be allowed to undertake domestic air travel within Pakistan." Meanwhile, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has issued fresh COVID-19 vaccination guidelines on air travel to and from, and within Pakistan.

It said unvaccinated Pakistani people between 15 and 18 years of age would be allowed domestic air travel up to 1 Nov 2021. A partial vaccination requirement would apply to them from 1 Nov 2021 and a full vaccination requirement from 1 Dec 2021.

The CAA said Pakistani passengers less than 15 years of age would be allowed domestic air travel without vaccination requirement. Foreigners/foreign passport holders less than 18 years of age will be allowed to travel within Pakistan without the vaccination requirement.

Passengers medically advised against COVID-19 vaccination and holding a certificate from a classified specialist doctor will also be allowed to travel on domestic flights without a vaccination certificate. And foreigners or foreign passport holders who have travelled to Pakistan before 1 Oct 2021 will be allowed to continue their domestic air travel without a vaccination certificate.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 1 Oct 2021 at 06:30 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
-------------------------------------------------------------------
India: 33 766 707 / 448 372 / 321
Bangladesh: 1 555 911 / 27 510 / 165
Pakistan: 1 246 538 / 27 785 / 123
Nepal: 795 061 / 11 135 / 374
Sri Lanka: 517 377 / 12 906 / 600
Afghanistan: 155 191 / 7206 / 180
Maldives: 84 809 / 231 / 418
Bhutan: 2601 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 173 215, 7591, 13 943, 6292, 7337, and 231 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 212 970, 10 117, 16 774, 6780, 11 346, and 473 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a decreasing trend of the disease in all these South Asian countries. The development of immunity in significant sections of these countries' populations due to natural infection and by vaccination could play a role in such a noticeable dropping of new cases. It would be interesting to know the current seroprevalence estimates of the virus in South Asian countries to have a gross idea about the threshold of herd immunity that would be protective against the delta variant of the virus.

Live Situational Analysis on COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka can be seen at https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/. As the curve of the disease is sharply falling, Sri Lanka has lifted a 6-week-long lockdown from today (Fri 1 Oct 2021) but will restrict people's movement for work and obtaining essentials (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-lifts-6-week-virus-lockdown-amid-economic-worries/articleshow/86671895.cms).

The current case positivity in Bangladesh is 3.24%, as indicated in item [4A] above, which is the lowest in the past 7 months. Bangladesh has a plan of vaccinating 80% of the population above the age of 18 years. So far, of the target population, 27% have received the 1st dose and 14% have received both 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).
