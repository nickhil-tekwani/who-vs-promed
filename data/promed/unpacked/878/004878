There has been an increase in mosquitoborne disease activity in the area, as well as a "heightened concern" that more residents could be affected, according to the Florida Department of Health in Volusia county. One human case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), has been confirmed, officials said. There had not been a human case of EEE in Volusia in more than 15 years, according to reports.

In July [2018], health officials issued a mosquitoborne illness advisory [notice] due to 2 confirmed cases of EEE, one in a horse and the other in a donkey. Several sentinel chicken flocks and an emu also tested positive for an EEE infection earlier this summer, reports stated.

Because the risk of transmission to humans has increased, Volusia County Mosquito Control and health officials are continuing their surveillance and prevention efforts. Residents and visitors are being reminded to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes and to take basic precautions to limit exposure.

Control mosquitoes outside your home
------------------------------------
- Remove standing water where mosquitoes could lay eggs.
- Once a week, empty and scrub, turn over, cover, or throw out any items that hold water like tires, buckets, planters, toys, pools, birdbaths, flowerpot saucers, or trash containers. Mosquitoes lay eggs near water.
- Tightly cover water storage containers (buckets, cisterns, rain barrels) so that mosquitoes cannot get inside to lay eggs.
- For containers without lids, use wire mesh with holes smaller than an adult mosquito.
- Use larvicides to treat large containers of water that will not be used for drinking and cannot be covered or dumped out.
- If you have a septic tank, repair cracks or gaps. Cover open vent or plumbing pipes. Use wire mesh with holes smaller than an adult mosquito.

Kill mosquitoes outside your home
---------------------------------
- Use an outdoor insect spray made to kill mosquitoes in areas where they rest.
- Mosquitoes rest in dark, humid areas like under patio furniture, or under the carport or garage. When using insecticides, always follow label instructions.

Control mosquitoes inside your home
-----------------------------------
Keep mosquitoes out!
- Install or repair and use window and door screens. Do not leave doors propped open.
- Use air conditioning when possible.

Kill mosquitoes inside your home
--------------------------------
- Use an indoor insect fogger* or indoor insect spray* to kill mosquitoes and treat areas where they rest. These products work immediately, and may need to be reapplied. When using insecticides, always follow label directions. Only using insecticide will not keep your home free of mosquitoes.
- Mosquitoes rest in dark, humid places like under the sink, in closets, under furniture, or in the laundry room.

[Florida is a state in which EEE virus is endemic. The virus is mosquito transmitted. Most cases occur in unvaccinated equine animals. Human EEE cases are very rare. Only a few cases are reported by CDC each year, occurring in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most cases of EEE virus infection in humans are inapparent or mild with only 4.5 per cent of cases severe. Severe cases occur most frequently in people under 15 and over 50 years of age. There is a 33 per cent case fatality rate in severe cases and survivors often have brain damage. There is no commercially available human vaccine, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only preventive measure.
