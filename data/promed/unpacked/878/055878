Sweden's Public Health Agency, Folkh√§lsomyndigheten reports investigating a _Cryptosporidium parvum_ outbreak in the country.

An increase in the number of reported cases of _Cryptosporidium_ infections was seen in the 1st 2 weeks of October [2022] compared to the same period in previous years.

Through typing (analysis of the parasite's genome), 61 cases have been confirmed to belong to the subtype _Cryptosporidum parvum_ IIaA15G2R1.

Of the confirmed cases, 41 are women and 20 are men. The cases are aged 11-86 years, average age of 44 years, and are native to 10 different regions in Sweden.

A further 98 cases are possible cases that have been reported within the period, some of which may belong to the outbreak. Affected infection control units, the Swedish Food Agency and the Public Health Agency are investigating the outbreak to identify the source of infection, which is suspected to be a food with wide distribution in Sweden.

[Cryptosporidiosis is a zoonotic protozoan infection with a natural reservoir in ruminants, from which surface water becomes contaminated from their feces. Worldwide, transmission to humans occurs mainly through contact with contaminated water but can be via food or exposure to infected animals.

ProMED has covered several previous outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in Sweden. A multi-region outbreak in 2019 with _C. parvum_ genotype A was traced to freshly squeezed fruit and vegetables. An outbreak in the south-central region of Vastra Gotaland County in 2015 was associated with the springtime movement of calves to summer pastures. Very large outbreaks in 2010-2011 affecting thousands of people in the 2 cities of Ostersund and Skelleftea were due to contaminated municipal water supplies.

In recent years, genotyping of _Cryptosporidium_ species and subspecies has become essential in identifying potential sources and scope of outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis (for a recent review, see: Pane S, Putignani L. _Cryptosporidium_: Still open scenarios. Pathogens. 2022; 11(5): 515; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens11050515).

The report above indicates that 61 patient isolates have been genotyped as _C. parvum_ IIaA15G2R1. This subtype is the most dominant zoonotic _Cryptosporidium_ species subtype infecting dairy cattle and humans in industrialized nations. Given this subtype and numerous simultaneously affected regions in Sweden, the source of this current outbreak may be a dairy food product. ProMED welcomes any additional information that will help elucidate this outbreak. - Mod.LXL
