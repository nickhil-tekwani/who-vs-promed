Outbreak of malaria in Badghis
----------------
An outbreak of malaria has been confirmed in the sub-district of
Kharkane, in the western Afghan province of Badghis. The timing of
the outbreak is somewhat surprising, as the malaria season should be
ending.
Another notable point is that, according to preliminary results, in
90 percent of the cases the variant concerned is falciparum malaria,
which is the most dangerous and which is uncommon in Afghanistan,
reports Medecins sans Frontieres.
MSF is responding to the outbreak in cooperation with the World
Health Organisation (WHO), the Afghan Ministry of Health and the NGO
Malteser.
The falciparum variant of malaria will be treated with an artesunate
combination therapy, the more common vivax variant with chloroquine.
Medical care is still far from adequate in large parts of the country
and aid organisations cannot reach almost half of the people due to
inaccessibility and insecurity. Consequently, infectious diseases
have free reign.

[According to the WHO "Roll Back Malaria" program in Afghanistan,
more than 50 percent of the population are living in malaria-endemic
areas, where more than 15 percent of the estimated cases in the
region (Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office) occur.
<http://www.emro.who.int/rbm/EpidemiologicalSituation-Section3.htm>
Checking GIDEON for background on malaria in Afghanistan revealed
that _Plasmodium vivax_ is the predominant organism. _P. falciparum_
accounted for 1.4 percent of total cases in 1991; 10 percent in 1994;
11.2 percent in 1999. Chloroquine-resistant _P. falciparum_ has been
reported with 67 percent of _P. falciparum_ in the eastern region
(Kunar, Nangarhar and Laghman) identified as chloroquine-resistant in
1999. In 1999 there were 395 581 cases reported, though the true
incidence is estimated at 2 to 3 million. The principal vectors are
_Anopheles superpictus_, _An. fluviatilis_, _An. pulcherrimus_, _An.
stephensi_, and _An. sergentii_ (in the south).

The principal risk period for malaria is during May through November,
below 2000 meters elevation.
While the affected district is located in the western part of
Afghanistan, where resistance to chloroquine has not been found to be
a major problem, an artemisinin derivative (artesunate) is being used
in recognition of the fact that chloroquine resistance has been
spreading in the region. Artemisinin and its derivatives should
generally be administered in combination with another effective blood
schizontocide to reduce recrudescences and to slow the development of
resistance.
