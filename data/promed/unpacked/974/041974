Summary
--------
Guinea reported no confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the week to 15 Nov [2015]. The most recent case from Guinea was reported on 29 Oct [2015]. That case is a child who was born in an Ebola treatment centre and who was delivered by medical staff wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). As such, no contacts are associated with this case, and all contacts associated with previous cases have completed their 21-day follow-up period. A 2nd consecutive blood sample from the child tested negative for Ebola virus on 16 Nov 2015.

On 7 Nov [2015], WHO declared that Ebola virus transmission had been stopped in Sierra Leone. The country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance, which is scheduled to conclude on 5 Feb [2016]. Both Liberia and Sierra Leone have now achieved objective 1 of the phase 3 response framework: to interrupt all remaining chains of Ebola virus transmission.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in currently unaffected areas and are central to the attainment of objective 2 of the phase 3 response framework: to manage and respond to the consequences of residual Ebola risks. To that end, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put surveillance systems in place to enable health workers and members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD. In the week to 15 Nov 2015, 26 493 such alerts were reported in Guinea, with alerts reported from all of the country's 34 prefectures. Equivalent data are not currently available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1496 alerts were reported from 14 of 14 districts in the week ending 8 Nov 2015 (the most recent week for which data are available).

As part of each country's EVD surveillance strategy, blood samples or oral swabs should be collected from any live or deceased individuals who have or had clinical symptoms compatible with EVD. In the week to 15 Nov [2015], 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 587 new and repeat samples from 14 of the country's 34 prefectures. 91 per cent of all samples tested in Guinea were swabs collected from dead bodies. By contrast, 85 per cent of the 757 new and repeat samples tested in Liberia over the same period were blood samples collected from live patients. In addition, all 15 counties in Liberia submitted samples for testing by the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1164 new samples (the lowest total reported in 2015) were collected from all 14 districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories. 93 per cent of samples in Sierra Leone were swabs collected from dead bodies.

463 deaths in the community were reported from Guinea in the week to 15 Nov [2015]. This represents approximately 21 per cent of the 2248 deaths expected based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 11 deaths per 1000 people per year. All but 1 of the 463 reported deaths were buried safely. Equivalent data are not yet available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1332 reports of community deaths were received through the alert system during the week ending 8 Nov [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available), representing approximately 64 per cent of the 2075 deaths expected each week based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 17 deaths per 1000 people per year.

Phase 3 response framework
----------------
28 598 confirmed, probable, and suspected cases have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, with 11 299 deaths (table 1; figure 2) since the onset of the Ebola outbreak. The majority of these cases and deaths were reported between August and December 2014, after which case incidence began to decline as a result of the rapid scale-up of treatment, isolation, and safe burial capacity in the 3 countries. This rapid scale-up operation was known as phase 1 of the response and was built on in the early 1st half of 2015 by a period of continuous refinement to surveillance, contact tracing, and community engagement interventions. This period, termed phase 2, succeeded in driving case incidence to 5 cases or fewer per week by the end of July 2015. This marked fall in case incidence signalled a transition to a distinct 3rd phase of the epidemic. This 3rd phase was characterised by limited transmission across small geographical areas, combined with a low probability of high consequence incidents of re-emergence of EVD from reservoirs of viral persistence. In order to effectively interrupt remaining transmission chains and manage the residual risks posed by viral persistence, WHO, as lead agency within the Interagency Collaboration on Ebola and in coordination with national and international partners, designed the phase 3 Ebola response framework. The phase 3 response framework builds on the foundations of phase 1 and phase 2 to incorporate new developments in Ebola control, from vaccines and rapid-response teams to counselling and welfare services for survivors. The indicators below detail progress made towards attaining the 2 primary objectives of the phase 3 framework.

Objective 1: rapidly interrupt all remaining chains of Ebola transmission
---------------------------
As of 7 Nov [2015] objective 1 of the phase 3 response framework has been achieved in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

In Guinea, case incidence has remained at 5 confirmed cases or fewer per week for 17 consecutive weeks. No confirmed cases were reported in the week to 15 Nov [2015]. Key performance indicators for objective 1 of the phase 3 response framework in Guinea are shown in table 4.

As of 14 Nov [2015] all contacts in Guinea had completed their 21-day follow-up period. The most recent case from Guinea was reported on 29 Oct [2015]. That case is a child who was born in an Ebola treatment centre in Conakry, and who was delivered by medical staff wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE). As such, no contacts are associated with this case. A second consecutive blood sample from the child tested negative for Ebola virus on 16 Nov [2015].

The Ebola ring vaccination trial is continuing in Guinea. All rings comprised of contacts and contacts of contacts associated with confirmed cases now receive immediate vaccination with the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine. Previously, rings were randomly allocated to receive either immediate vaccination or vaccination 21 days after the confirmation of a case. On 1 Sep [2015], the eligibility criteria for the trial were amended to allow the vaccination of children aged 6 years and above.

Locations of the 7 operational Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Guinea are shown in figure 6. No health worker infections were reported in the week to 15 Nov [2015] (table 4).

Objective 2: Manage and respond to the consequences of residual risks
--------------------------------
Key performance indicators for objective 2 of the phase 3 response framework are shown for Guinea (table 5), Liberia (table 6), and Sierra Leone (table 7). Data for several phase 3 indicators from Liberia are available at country level and will be included in subsequent situation reports.

Robust surveillance measures are essential to ensure the rapid detection of any reintroduction or re-emergence of EVD in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which have both entered 90-day periods of enhanced surveillance, and in the large areas of Guinea that have been free of EVD transmission for many months (figure 6). To that end, Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone have each put systems in place to enable members of the public to report any case of illness or death that they suspect may be related to EVD. In the week to 15 Nov [2015], 26 493 such alerts were reported in Guinea (table 5), with alerts reported from all of the country's 34 prefectures. Equivalent data are not currently available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1496 alerts were reported from 14 of 14 districts in the week ending 8 Nov [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available; table 7).

As part of each country's EVD surveillance strategy, blood samples or oral swabs should be collected from any live or deceased individuals who have or had clinical symptoms compatible with EVD. In the week to 15 Nov [2015], 9 operational laboratories in Guinea tested a total of 587 new and repeat samples from 14 of the country's 34 prefectures (figures 4 and 5). 91per cent of all samples tested in Guinea were swabs collected from dead bodies. By contrast, 85 per cent of the 757 new and repeat samples tested in Liberia over the same period were blood samples collected from live patients (figures 4 and 5). In addition, all 15 counties in Liberia submitted samples for testing by the country's 4 operational laboratories. 1164 new samples (the country's lowest weekly total in 2015) were collected from all 14 districts in Sierra Leone and tested by 9 operational laboratories (figures 4 and 5). 93 per cent of samples in Sierra Leone were swabs collected from dead bodies.

Figures 4 and 5 show the locations of operational laboratories in each of the 3 countries, along with the geographic distribution of blood samples taken from live patients with symptoms compatible with EVD, and of oral swabs taken collected from dead bodies. In both Guinea and Sierra Leone the majority of samples tested in the week to 15 Nov [2015] were oral swabs collected from dead bodies (91 per cent and 93 per cent, respectively). By contrast, 85 per cent of samples tested in Liberia were blood samples collected from live patients.

463 deaths in the community were reported from Guinea in the week to 15 Nov [2015] (table 5). This represents approximately 21 per cent of the 2248 deaths expected based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 11 deaths per 1000 people per year. All but 1 of the 463 reported deaths were buried safely. Equivalent data are not yet available for Liberia. In Sierra Leone, 1332 reports of community deaths were received through the alert system during the week ending 8 Nov [2015] (the most recent week for which data are available; table 6), representing approximately 64 [2015] of the 2075 deaths expected each week based on estimates of the population and a crude mortality rate of 17 deaths per 1000 people per year.

Capacity to isolate and treat patients with EVD remains central to the attainment of phase 3 objective 1. Phase 3 objective 2 depends on the maintenance of core standby treatment and isolation capacity. The locations of the 18 operational Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone are shown in figure 6.

The deployment of rapid-response teams to quickly limit the transmission of Ebola virus following the detection of a new chain of transmission was and continues to be a cornerstone of the national response strategy in Sierra Leone. Between 14 and 28 Nov [2015] planning will commence for a series of simulation exercises to test national and international rapid-response capacities in the event of detection of a new case of EVD.

The unprecedented scale of the EVD outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone means there are estimated to be several thousands of survivors throughout the 3 countries. Survivors have contributed enormously to many aspects of response, but they face many challenges. In addition to the stigmatization they frequently experience when they return to their own communities, survivors also face myriad health issues, from joint pains and headaches to problems with vision and poor mental health. Although there is a vibrant self-organised survivor-support community, survivors require specialized medical support as well as access to routine health care services such as ante-natal care and vaccinations and screening. With guidance from WHO and other partners, ministries of health in the 3 most-affected countries have plans in place to deliver a comprehensive package of services to ensure the welfare of survivors and mitigate risks posed by viral persistence. ... -more

18 Nov 2015: Study finds that Ebola vaccine is safe and stimulates strong immune response
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-11-ebola-vaccine-safe-strong-immune.html
[According to a study published in the latest issue of the journal Lancet Infectious Disease, a clinical trial of a new Ebola vaccine (ChAd3-EBO-Z) has found that it is well tolerated and stimulates strong immune responses in adults in Mali, West Africa and in the US. Larger trials, sponsored by GSK Biologicals, have already started.

Use of ChAd3-EBO-Z Ebola virus vaccine in Malian and US adults, and boosting of Malian adults with MVA-BN-Filo: a phase 1, single-blind, randomised trial, a phase 1b, open-label and double-blind, dose-escalation trial, and a nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial 2015.

Research

Kucharski, A.J., Camacho, A., Flasche, F. et al. (17 Nov 2015). Measuring the impact of Ebola control measures in Sierra Leone, _Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 112 no. 46 14366-14371_. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1508814112

[Significance. Between June 2014 and February 2015, thousands of Ebola treatment beds were introduced in Sierra Leone, alongside other infection control measures. However, there has been criticism of the timing and focus of this response, and it remains unclear how much it contributed to curbing the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic. Using a mathematical model, we estimated how many Ebola virus disease cases the response averted in each district of Sierra Leone. We estimated that 56 600 (95 per cent credible interval: 48 300-84 500) Ebola cases were averted in Sierra Leone as a direct result of additional treatment beds. Moreover, the number of cases averted would have been even greater had beds been available 1 month earlier.]

[The authors found that the effect varied considerably by district, with large impacts in districts with large outbreaks, and noted the highly variable nature of Ebola transmission. -Mod.LK]

Technology

17 Nov 2015: Xenex Germ-Zapping Robot destroys Ebola virus & Anthrax spores in new study performed at Texas Biomed Biosafety Level 4 Lab
http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151117006753/en/Xenex-Germ-Zapping-Robot%E2%84%A2-Destroys-Ebola-Virus-Anthrax
[The study validates the effectiveness of pulsed Xenon UV light disinfection technology on Ebola virus and anthrax. In Texas Biomed's BSL-4 lab, the Xenex robot destroyed both Ebola and anthrax spores on surfaces, achieving a greater-than-4-log reduction of Ebola in 1 minute, and a greater than 3-log reduction in anthrax spores in 15 minutes. In none of the time/distance combinations was either anthrax or Ebola detected after the Xenex device was used. The study was done using live Ebola virus and _Bacillus anthracis_.]
