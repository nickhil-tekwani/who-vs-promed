Rabies, France
--------------
Information received on [17 Feb 2020] from Dr Loic Evain, [Deputy Director General, CVO, Directorate General for Food, Ministry of Agriculture and Food], Paris, France

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Start date: 1 Feb 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 13 Feb 2020
Report date: 14 Feb 2020
Date submitted to OIE: 17 Feb 2020
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: May 2015
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: rabies virus
Serotype: RABV
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Saint Martin De Re, Saint Martin De Re, Charente-Maritime
Date of start of the outbreak: 1 Feb 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Dogs / 2 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: an unidentified young dog, around 3 months old and illegally introduced into France, showed sudden signs of aggressiveness (+++) on [1 Feb 2020]. The owner brought the animal to a veterinarian on [3 Feb 2020]. The veterinary services request the dog to be euthanized for rabies diagnosis.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Dogs / 50 / 0 / 0 / 50
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): unknown or inconclusive, introduction of new live animals
Epidemiological comments: the exact origin of the dog is not known at this stage of the epidemiological investigation. The owner stated that he had travelled outside the national territory. The typing of the virus, carried out by partial sequencing of the nucleoprotein and polymerase genes, is consistent and shows that it is a lyssavirus of the rabies virus species, type Africa 1, a virus that does not circulate neither in France nor in Europe, but in northern Africa, the dog being the primary host. According to the analysis of the partial sequence (800b) of the nucleoprotein gene, the most probable origin is Morocco. The nucleotide sequences obtained are particularly close to those of viruses isolated in northern Morocco in an area going from Al Hoceima to Ifrane and including the cities of Sidi Kacem, Tazaa, and Taounate. Further investigations are ongoing to precisely identify the origin of the virus and to get an even more precise location.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; quarantine; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Institute Pasteur, Paris (national laboratory) / dogs / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 13 Feb 2020 / positive
Institute Pasteur, Paris (national laboratory) / dogs / virus isolation / 13 Feb 2020 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[As is mentioned in the epidemiological comments above, although "The exact origin of the dog is not known at this stage of the epidemiological investigation," the typing of the virus, carried out by partial sequencing of the nucleoprotein and polymerase genes, is consistent and shows that it is a lyssavirus of the rabies virus species, type Africa 1, a virus that does not circulate in either France or Europe, but in northern Africa. According to the analysis of the partial sequence (800b) of the nucleoprotein gene, the most probable origin is Morocco."

"Rabies is endemic in Morocco, with all provinces being affected, except the southern desert region. The most common lyssavirus present is genotype 1 (rabies virus, RABV), with human infections being mostly due to the canine biotype."

"The main vector for rabies in Morocco is the domestic dog. In 2000, the dog population was estimated at around 1.6 million, with 10 percent of the population being stray dogs." (https://www.who.int/rabies/epidemiology/Rabies_CP_Morocco_09_2014.pdf)

According to the OIE World Animal Health Database (WAHID) from January 2018 to June 2019, Morocco reported 234 outbreaks of rabies. The detailed data on each event, by month and location, are available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

"Rabies is responsible for around 59 000 deaths worldwide each year, mainly in Asia and Africa, most often following a bite from a rabid dog. Every year, approximately 17 million people receive treatment following exposure to suspected rabid animals.

"No human cases of rabies contracted on the French mainland have been reported since 1924. In 2008, a human case probably caused by a bat bite was reported in French Guiana. Human cases contracted outside France and diagnosed within the country have also been recorded. The last patient to die from rabies in France (a 10-year-old child in east-central France; city of Lyon) was diagnosed in October 2017, after presenting the 1st clinical signs, following a lengthy stay in Sri Lanka.

"Anyone traveling to an endemic area -- mainly Asia and Africa, and also to a lesser extent Central Europe, the Middle East, and South America -- should take precautions to avoid wild and domestic animals."
