New cholera strain has PGI worried
-------------------------------------
The alarm bells have started ringing. PGI's Medical Microbiology Department
has found a strain of cholera-causing bacteria that was last spotted in
Kolkata 14 years ago. PGI chanced upon the bacteria while analyzing water
samples collected during a cholera outbreak in Sector 50 Labour Colony last
year [2004]. Fearing a cholera outbreak in the summer, PGI has sent the
samples to the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED),
Kolkata and are awaiting the reports.
Dr. Neelam Taneja, who analyzed the samples, said, "After the 1994 outbreak
due to _V. cholerae_ O139, cholera became quiescent here. However, 4
confirmed cases, during 2000-01, were due to _V. cholerae_ Ogawa." In July
2002, the city witnessed a major outbreak due to mixing of sewage and
drinking water. In 2003, a few cases of cholera were reported, and in 2004,
100 people were affected in Labour Colony. "_V. cholerae_ was isolated from
one of the hand pumps, soil surrounding it and the pond. The outbreaks were
caused by _V. cholerae_ Ogawa. However, the notable change that has
recently occurred is the emergence of Inaba as the predominant stereotype,"
she said.
Since 9 Jul 2004, all _V. cholerae_ isolated at PGI belong to Inaba, which
was last reported from Kolkata in 1989. "This is the 1st time dominance of
Inaba has been reported from this region," confirmed Dr. Taneja and the
head of the Medical Microbiology Department, Prof. Meera Sharma, in PGI's
bulletin.
"It is difficult to say why did this happen. However, the implications are
grave. Delhi witnessed a massive outbreak in April 2004 owing to Inaba.
Since this is a new stereotype, adults are also affected," warned Dr.
Taneja. In PGI's bulletin, Prof. Sharma and Dr. Taneja observed: "Detailed
genetic studies of the emerged Inaba may be required to assess the impact
on current vaccine strategies. The changing epidemiology of cholera calls
for stronger surveillance and timely notification of the cases."
On the challenge posed by the rising population in the periphery, Dr.
Taneja says, "The only way to forestall such outbreaks is organized
development and sanitary conditions there."

[The 3 serotypes of _V. cholerae_ of the O1 are Ogawa (containing O
antigens A and B), Inaba (containing O antigens A and C) and Hikojima
(containing O antigens A, B and C). The latter serotype is relatively rare.
The O139 Bengal strain, which became epidemic in late 1992, has a changed
antigenic structure. - Mod.LL]

4 dead, as cholera outbreak hits Burundi capital
-----------------------------------------------
A cholera outbreak has hit a slum in the northern part of Burundi's
capital, killing 4 people in the past week, health officials said on Mon 17
Jan 2005. In addition to the deaths, at least 64 people have been diagnosed
with the deadly disease since 13 Jan 2005, Mathias Karimwabo, the local
official in charge of Bujumbura's Kamenge district, said. An official with
Burundi's health ministry, Georges Nsengiyunva, confirmed an outbreak of
cholera in Kamenge and said steps were being taken to prevent it from
spreading, although some cases had already been reported outside the district.
"The epidemic is likely to spread, and some cases have already been
reported, but it is Kamenge district that has been hit hardest up until
now," Nsengiyunva said. Karimwabo blamed the outbreak of the waterborne
disease, which causes serious diarrhea and vomiting and can be fatal if not
properly treated, on poor sanitation and stagnant water in the Kavumu
section of Kamenge district.

[3] Cholera - Nigeria

Cholera outbreaks attributed to lack of clean water
-----------------------------------------------
A representative of the Federal Ministry of Health, Dr. I. Coker, has said
that the greatest challenge facing the country is the non-availability of
water, as nearly half of the population does not have access to potable
water. He explained that the unavailability of water, especially in the
rural areas, is chiefly responsible for the outbreak of cholera in 7
states, including Kano and Jigawa states.
"So far, we have recorded 2807 cases with 6.5 percent case fatality. The
greatest challenge is to make water available. Apart from cholera, diarrhea
and typhoid are other manifestations of water-borne infection. While most
rural areas have wells, chlorination still remains a key intervention," he
said.
Also speaking, Mr. Wale Adedeji, general manager, Reproductive Health and
Maternal, Child Health, SFH said: "It is well known that lack of access to
safe water remains a major problem for more than a billion people in the
developing world.
"Annually, 2 to 3 million children less than 5 years of age die of
diarrhea-related diseases, mostly acquired through exposure to contaminated
water." He stated that despite the adoption of Nigeria National Water
Supply and Sanitation Policy 2000, only 54 percent of Nigerians have access
to an improved water supply, and diarrhea diseases remain a leading cause
of death, second only to malaria, in children under 5 years of age.
"Government efforts to deliver [a] safe and reliable water supply remain an
essential long-term goal that requires huge investment through both
[public] and private sources."

Dysentery breaks out in Rubanda
-----------------------------------
Dysentery has broken out in Rubanda West, the Director of the District
Health Services, Dr. Patrick Tusiime, said on Wed 12 Jan 2005 while
addressing environmental and health staff undergoing a 3-day training on
HIV/AIDS prevention and communication skills.
Tusiime said he had alerted the Ministry of Health about the outbreak. "We
have received information that there has been an outbreak of dysentery in
Rubanda West. I have instructed my staff to visit the place and verify the
problem," he said. He attributed the outbreak to low latrine use in the
district. Tusiime said such diseases occurred because of contamination of
water with human wastes.

Metro issues warning on children's illness
-----------------------------------------
Health officials are warning parents of day-care and elementary school
children about an outbreak of shigellosis, a bacterial illness that can
cause severe diarrhea and vomiting.
The Metro Public Health Department issued its warning after seeing a sharp
increase in the number of cases of the disease in Davidson County. Usually,
one or 2 cases are reported in Nashville every month. In December 2004,
there were 21 cases.
Health Department spokesman Brian Todd said the illness appeared to be
spread throughout the county, and that epidemiologists hadn't been able to
find a common source. "It wasn't from a single school or day-care," Todd
said. "It's in kids in that age group in different areas of the county."
The bacterial illness is most common in young children and causes vomiting,
diarrhea that can be bloody, fever and stomach cramps. It usually resolves
in 5 to 7 days, and, in the vast majority of cases, doesn't cause any
complications.
Dr. Tim Jones, deputy state epidemiologist for the Tennessee Department of
Health, says the number of shigellosis cases tends to rise and fall in 5 or
6 year cycles. In the past few years, the number of cases has been on the
upswing.
The last major outbreak of shigellosis in Tennessee was in 1998, with
nearly 900 cases statewide. Nearly half of those cases were in Davidson
alone. By encouraging physicians to test for the disease and by encouraging
the public to wash their hands regularly, health officials hope to avoid a
similar outbreak.
