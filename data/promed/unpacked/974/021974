A fox kit from Anoka County has tested positive for a deadly, highly contagious bird flu that has killed countless wild birds this spring [2022] to the concern of wildlife specialists.

The positive case is the 1st confirmed of highly pathogenic avian influenza, or HPAI, in a wild mammal in Minnesota, according to the Department of Natural Resources [DNR].

It's not unprecedented -- 2 red fox kits in Ontario tested positive last week [week of 2 May 2022] for the flu strain, the DNR said in a news release Wednesday [11 May 2022]. They were the 1st reported cases in mammals in North America.

DNR Wildlife Health Program Supervisor Michelle Carstensen said Thursday [12 May 2022] that fox kits already were on the agency's radar, knowing their diet and their biological vulnerability. The DNR was aware of ailing fox kits turning up at a wildlife rehabilitation center in Sherburne County.

"This virus is hard on them," she said, adding it hasn't turned up in adults.

The University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory alerted the DNR to the kit's case from Anoka County. A family had found the sick fox and it died before the family got it to the lab. DNR wildlife health specialists will add bird flu to the routine screening when sick foxes are brought to the lab, the agency said.

Some waterfowl like ducks and geese are considered hosts for bird viruses, which spread as they migrate. The current outbreak, which originated in Europe, has been more widespread and aggressive than the last outbreak in 2015, and it has dramatically affected the poultry industry, too.

Waterfowl have been hit hard and, in turn, the raptors that have eaten their dead bodies. The DNR said testing so far in Minnesota has confirmed bird flu in about 200 wild birds, including 19 species.

Carstensen said more cases of sick fox kits have been reported in Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan, and other states, and it's possible the virus turns up in other species, like skunks and rabbits.

"[The virus] is confirmed in 6 counties in Minnesota, but I am going to guess it is everywhere in Minnesota," she said.

Carstensen said she and her staff will continue to watch for new cases and test species that appear "to be a good fit," knowing viruses change -- much like what has happened with strains of the coronavirus. She said there is no evidence yet that domestic pets are at risk.

But she sounded caution. "The million dollar question is predicting what it is going to do," she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other health officials have said the risk to the public remains low.

"The best advice we have for Minnesotans is to avoid contact with wildlife that appear sick or injured and contact your health care provider if you are bitten or have other close contact with wildlife," said Dr Joni Scheftel, Minnesota Department of Health public health veterinarian, in the DNR news release.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak (HPAI) has spread into red fox kits in 4 US states -- each of which are states where the virus has been confirmed in commercial poultry flocks.

According to a report from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), most of these cases occurred in wildlife rehabilitation centers, with the 1st one being reported in mid-April [2022].

The cases were confirmed at the following locations:

Rock County, Wisconsin
Waushara County, Wisconsin
Jefferson County, Wisconsin
Lapeer County, Michigan
Hancock County, Iowa
St. Clair County, Michigan
Anoka County, Minnesota
Dane County, Wisconsin

In the Jefferson County and Macomb County cases, 2 animals were affected by the virus, but only one died. In all other cases, there was only one animal affected, and all of those foxes died.

The OIE report stated that the cases in Rock, Waushara, Jefferson, Macomb, Lapeer, St Clair, and Dane counties [?], but the cases in Hancock and Anoka counties were in unspecified locations.

The strain found in these animals was a Eurasian strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1.

It was earlier announced that HPAI had also been confirmed in 2 red fox kits in St Mary's, Ontario, Canada. The same strain of the virus was found in the foxes in both countries, the OIE stated.

In accordance with OIE standards, the detection of HPAI in backyard flocks, wild birds, and wildlife should not have any impact on the international poultry trade.

So far in 2022, HPAI has been confirmed in commercial poultry flocks in Michigan, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Colorado, North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Utah. The virus has also been found in commercial game bird operations in Texas, New York, and South Dakota.

HPAI has been confirmed in all of Canada's provinces, but it has not affected commercial poultry in Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, or New Brunswick.

Infections by HPAI viruses in mammals are typically not common, but foxes have been shown to be susceptible to infection by HPAI H5N1 and H5N8 previously in Europe and Japan. However, the reports in Eurasia have been sporadic, while since April 2022 there have been several reports of cubs infected by HPAI H5N1 in Canada and the USA. Virus evolution and adaptive mutations must be closely monitored to rapidly identify viruses with increased potential to infect mammals. - Mod.PMB]
