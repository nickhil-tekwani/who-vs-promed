We have been informed from a reliable source that during the 2nd
semester of 2007, clinical cases of a disease suspected to be
epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) have been described in cattle in
several locations in the Eastern Mediterranean. Further information,
in particular clinical description, epidemiological data, and
laboratory results are urgently requested.

[EHD in cattle emerged in the southern and eastern parts of the
Mediterranean in the fall of 2006, namely in the Maghreb (Morocco,
Tunisia and Algeria), Israel and (see 20061215.3525) Jordan. Sporadic
cases had been recorded in Morocco in 2004. See data on laboratory
investigations of samples from 2004 and 2006 at
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsrna_virus_proteins//ReoID/EHDV-isolates.htm>.
It seems that the EHD virus strains in the Maghreb were not similar
to the Israeli strain.

The (suspected, until further information becomes available) spread
of EHD, an orbivirus closely related to bluetongue, in the eastern
Mediterranean is a threat to other countries in the region as well as
to southeast Europe. In view of the approaching vector (_Culicoides_)
season, an early response is anticipated. In case samples have
reached a laboratory, any results -- even preliminary ones -- deserve
to become available without delay. - Mod.AS]
