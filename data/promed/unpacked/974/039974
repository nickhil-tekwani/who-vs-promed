A 43 year old biologist infected with the rabies virus died on Wed 14 Nov 2018 the Ministry of Health has confirmed. His admission to the medical center occurred 2 months after the biologist entered a cave during a family outing on 15 Aug 2018 in Copey de Dota and had contact with bats, suffering a bite on one of his arms. He began to manifest symptoms [numbness and paralysis, difficulties swallowing, and behavioral disorders] on 11 Oct 2018, when he finally decided to obtain medical help. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of San Juan de Dios Hospital in San Jose on 21 Oct 2018, where he remained on life support but died of cardiorespiratory failure according to Daniel Salas Peraza, director of health surveillance, in the Ministry of Health.

The rabies virus is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected host. The bite transmits infected saliva, passing the virus to a previously uninfected animal. In humans, rabies is fatal unless treated before severe symptoms occur. If untreated, the virus spreads through the central nervous system, reaching the brain and ultimately leading to death.

All travelers should exercise caution when in close proximity to animals, including wild animals and strays. Street dogs are common in Costa Rica. For adventure travelers, particularly cavers who may find themselves in close proximity to infected bats, and long-term travelers, including expats, who may be spending extended periods of time in high-risk areas, vaccination may be recommended.

If traveling with children, tell them not to pet wild or domestic animals (especially when unsupervised). Children might not report scratches or bites, making them particularly vulnerable. If bitten by a potentially rabid animal, you should 1st wash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. You should then seek medical attention immediately.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): "The 1st symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu, including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or a headache." These symptoms can last for days, often accompanied by an itching sensation at the site of the bite. As the disease progresses, symptoms such as agitation, hallucinations, and delirium start to appear.

[2] Colombia - bovine, equine

The Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) confirmed 7 cases of rabies in bovine and equine animals in Urrao, south west Antioquia. This prompted the Ministry of Health to declare a departmental epidemiological alert due to the fact that some bulls, cows and horses infected with the virus have attacked other animals, according to a RCN Radio report (computer translated).

These facts oblige the departmental agency to declare an epidemiological alert for rabies in Antioquia, municipality of Urrao, which requires intensifying actions to promote health, advance comprehensive risk management, implement public health actions of these outbreaks, follow-up, and epidemiological surveillance of the behavior of the disease.

The plan of action includes, among other interventions, the implementation of a contingency plan and assistance to indigenous and Afro-descendant communities, establishment of a strategy and a network of care for people who may be affected by bites or scratches, and timely and appropriate medical treatment, as well as a census of dogs and cats and their vaccination.

The indigenous reservations Valle de Pérdida, Majoré and Andabú, as well as the Afrodescendant Mandé, have been in contact with the infected animals. The outbreak of rabies is of a wild origin transmitted by bats.

The Government of Antioquia sent a commission of 9 health experts to Urrao to prevent humans from becoming infected.

[Bats can transmit rabies to any animal: human, bovine or equine. There are preventative vaccines against this disease for humans and animals.

Please note that ProMED-mail posted previously on the person in Costa Rica when his diagnosis was confirmed. Our sympathies to his family and friends. Readers are encouraged to review 2 ProMED-mail posts: Rabies (54): Americas (Costa Rica) bat, human, background 20181030.6118913, and Rabies (53): Americas (Costa Rica) bat, human 20181028.6117187.

Although Costa Rica may have one of the lowest incidences of rabies of countries in Central America, animals other than bats are prone to the virus.

The 2nd posting here regards both horses and cattle. These animals can attack humans. When they do, it does not usually end well for the smaller creature, usually a human being. Rabies seems to make affected horses and cattle become frighteningly violent. There are vaccines available for your horses and cattle. They are very effective and relatively inexpensive, especially if a human life is involved.

I encourage all readers, regardless of your country of residence, to take a stand against rabies and vaccinate your animals. Yes, vaccinate your dogs, cats, horses, cows and almost any other mammal you have. Check with your veterinarian for assistance. - Mod.TG]
