[Note: The appearance of the first CDC/ArboNET report of 2004,
providing national data for the United States, sets the clock for
these updates. From now on West Nile virus updates will be posted
weekly in synchrony with release of the cumulative figures for the
United States. As previously, reports of special significance (such
as changes in geographic range, virulence and pathogenicity, vector
specificity and anything else of special significance) will be posted
separately as they come to hand. - Mod.CP]

West Nile Virus Activity - United States: Wed 2 to Tue 8 Jun 2004
------------------------------------------------
Human cases
-----------
As of Tue 8 Jun 2004, 2 states had reported a total of 7 human cases
of West Nile virus (WNV) illness to CDC through ArboNET. 6 cases
were reported from Arizona and one case from New Mexico. 4 (57
percent) of the cases occurred in males; the median age of patients
was 53 years (range: 22 to 69 years), and the dates of onset of
illness ranged from 9 May to 1 Jun 2004. [An 8th case has been
reported -- the 1st of the year from South Dakota; see the following
report]
Birds and Equines
-----------------
In addition, during 2004, a total of 334 dead corvids and 55 other
dead birds with WNV infection have been reported from 16 states, and
7 WNV infections in horses have been reported from 3 states (Alabama,
Arizona, and Texas).
[ProMED posted a news report dated 29 May 2004 of an equine case in Virginia -
- see: West Nile virus update 2004 - USA (08) 20040601.1489.
Does its omission from the above list mean it has not been confirmed? -

Sentinel Chickens and Mosquitoes
--------------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 64 sentinel chicken flocks
from 4 states (Arizona, California, Florida, and Louisiana), and 58
WNV-positive mosquito pools have been reported from 6 states
(Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania).
Additional information about national WNV activity is available from CDC at

South Dakota: 1st Human Case of West Nile Virus Infection of Year
---------------------------------------------------
Confirmation of South Dakota's 1st case of human West Nile virus
infection in 2004 brought with it a reminder that people need to
protect themselves from this sometimes-deadly disease. A Jackson
County child under 10 years of age was hospitalized briefly with the
virus and has since recovered, Lon Kightlinger, state Health
Department epidemiologist, stated Tuesday. It is the 1st confirmed
case from 245 human samples tested.
Tests on 13 birds and 122 mosquito pools also have been negative.
"After 2003's epidemic we certainly expected to see cases again this
year, but not this early," said Doneen Hollingsworth, state secretary
of health. "This case is the wake-up call that it's time for all of
us to eliminate mosquito breeding areas and start protecting
ourselves with mosquito repellant."
The mosquito-borne disease killed 14 people in South Dakota during
2003 and sickened more than 1000 others. South Dakota joins New
Mexico, Arizona and Wyoming with confirmed human cases of West Nile
virus infection in 2004, Kightlinger said. "It's about 6 weeks
earlier than our 1st human case last year. And for northern-tier
states, it's very early, too," he said. The Health Department did
extra testing and consulted with the Centers for Disease Control to
verify the results because it's so early, and there was some
indication it may have been a carry-over from 2003. The early case
suggests an infected mosquito survived winter and bit the youngster
around the second week of May, he said.
People over age 50 are at the greatest risk of developing severe
complications from the virus, and those over age 70 are at the
greatest risk of dying, Kightlinger said. Anyone who contracts the
virus -- even in its mildest forms -- develops antibodies and is
considered to have lifetime immunity.
Many people who get the virus don't know they have it. In other
cases, it causes flu-like symptoms. At worst, it progresses to
life-threatening encephalitis or meningitis.

Dead Bird Test Results (As of Thu 10 Jun 2004)

Province / Tested / Presumed positive / Confirmed positive
Newfoundland & Labrador / 0 / 0 / 0
Prince Edward Island / 5 / 0 / 0
Nova Scotia / 4 / 0 / 0
New Brunswick /32 / 0 / 0

Canada Total / 604 / 2 / 15
[An additional 142 dead birds have been tested since the figures were
released 48 hours ago and posted in the preceding update. These have
yielded 2 presumed and one additional confirmed WNV-positive birds.
Saskatchewan has joined Ontario as the only other province reporting West
Nile virus-positive birds so far in 2004. - Mod.CP]
[It is somewhat surprising to find a human case (in S. Dakota) -- with
implicitly no history of travel -- in the absence of detectable bird cases
and mosquito isolates; but only 13 birds & 122 mosquito pools have been
tested so far. - Mod.JW]
