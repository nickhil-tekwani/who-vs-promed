Fruit bats are suspected to be the source of a deadly brain virus which has
killed more than 100 in Malaysia. Antibodies to the virus, thought to have
been passed from pigs to humans, perhaps via mosquitoes, have been found in
the bats by Australian researchers, raising the possibility that they may
be the original "reservoir" for the disease.
New Scientist reports that more than 300 blood samples have been taken from
bats throughout Malaysia. In some areas, as many as a quarter of them show
signs of contact with the virus. However, the conclusive proof - the
presence of the virus itself - has not yet been found, although further
tests are being carried out in the US on bat tissue.
Scientists now hope the lethal outbreak will produce funding to allow
testing of bats throughout south-east Asia. Peter Young of the Queensland
Animal Research Institute said: "We want to check bats from the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea."

[The original message contained numerous misleading statements (a)
confusing Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, and Hendra viruses, (b) on the
irrelevant use of JE vaccine, and (c) other non sequiturs. These were
deleted prior to posting but it shows there is still considerable confusion
as to the problem, the cause and, therefore, the solution. - Mod.CHC
