Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 4 Feb 2022
Confirmed: 17 Feb 2022
Reported: 21 Feb 2022
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in a zone or a compartment
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1

["The dynamic of the spread of influenza viruses is extremely complex and difficult to predict. Several factors can influence it, such as the wild bird migration pattern, unregulated trade, farming systems, biosecurity, and immunity status.

"During the Northern Hemisphere winter, the wild bird movements may increase, and lower temperatures may facilitate the environmental survival of AI viruses, increasing exposure of infection in poultry. Additionally, the mixing of wild birds from different geographic origins during migration can increase the risk of virus spread and genetic reassortment resulting in changes in viral properties. At local level, as the AI viruses can survive for long periods in the environment, they can be easily transmitted from farm to farm by the movement of infected animals, as well as contaminated boots, vehicles and equipment if the adequate biosecurity measures are not implemented."
