Almost 1200 schoolchildren in northeast China were taken ill after drinking
soy milk contaminated with a form of dysentery bacillus, state media
reported on Monday. Children at 11 schools in Jilin city, Jilin province,
suffered fevers, stomach cramps and vomiting after drinking the milk, which
had been provided free of charge by a firm which had just started producing
the drink.
The source of the poisoning was traced to a form of dysentery bacillus in
the soy milk, the China Daily said, adding that the children were now
recovering after falling ill last week. The Jilin Wanfang Scientific,
Industrial and Trade Ltd Co. had provided the soy milk for free and asked
pupils to drink it on a trial basis, an unnamed teacher told the newspaper.
Police had detained the firm's president and a food inspector following the
poisoning, the daily added.
Last week it was reported that 100 primary school children in the eastern
city of Shanghai had fallen ill in another suspected food poisoning case,
with 3 in a critical condition.

[The etiology of this outbreak is uncertain (perhaps shigellosis), but it
is most likely the result of fecal contamination of water used to prepare
the soy milk, or contamination by a food handler during the production
process. Additional information would be welcomed. - Mod.ES]
