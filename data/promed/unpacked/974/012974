Three rare horse diseases were recently found in Otter Tail, Pine and Swift counties, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. Recent testing shows equine infectious anemia (EIA) was found in Pine County.

Equine infectious anemia requires infected horses to be euthanized or quarantined for life due to lack of treatment or vaccine. It is not known to affect humans.

"This is also a high-risk time of year for horses to become infected with these diseases," said Dr. Courtney Wheeler, Board of Animal Health equine program director. The infected horse was euthanized.

For more information on the cases, visit the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.

A 6-year-old Quarter Horse gelding in Lake County, Indiana tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA) on 19 Jul 2019.

Officials subsequently retested the index horse and tested and quarantined 10 exposed horses at the same premises. The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa confirmed both the suspect Quarter Horse's initial and 2nd samples tested positive on agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) testing. Officials are performing additional trace-back work, because the premises' owner maintains facilities in both Indiana and Illinois; however, the owner stated that the horse had not been moved recently.

Veterinarians euthanized the positive horse on 29 Jul 2019 and will test the remaining horses when the quarantine expires 60 days from the affected horse's diagnosis. Routine Coggins testing continues to be the most effective method of EIA control, said Sandy Norman, DVM, director of the Indiana State Board of Animal Health's companion and equine division.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most U.S. states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for disease spread. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit:

**Progressive condition loss;
**Muscle weakness;
**Poor stamina;
**Fever;
**Depression; and
**Anemia.

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards from unaffected equids) for the rest of its life.

[So many articles tell us about horses dying of EIA. What I do not see is anyone willing to do or doing research on creating a vaccine for this disease. The technology and know-how are surely out there, yet no research papers or progress reports.

It is in all probability a funding issue. For as we hear about a lot of horses dying from this disease, USDA estimates that it is only 1-2 percent of the USA's equine population. Nevertheless, that is a lot of horses and a lot of heartache, and it remains a very sad situation. - Mod.TG
