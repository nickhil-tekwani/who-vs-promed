Indonesia -- additional case of H5N1 confirmed
----------------------------------------------
The Indonesia Ministry of Health's Biomedical and Pharmaceutical
Research Center Laboratory has confirmed a positive bird flu H5N1
case. The victim is a 2 year old boy, a resident of Depok, West Java
province.

The child started to feel unwell on 4 Feb 2011 with signs of fever
and with rashes on hand, mouth, and feet. He was then [attended by] a
private practitioner, and later referred to a private hospital in
Depok where he died.

Risk factors: a neighbor is rearing ornamental birds. Also, a bird's
death was reported within 2 weeks (before the onset of illness). A
Disease Control and Environmental Health team with Health Service have
been dispatched for controlling the situation.

The case has been reported to WHO by the Directorate General of
Disease Control and Environmental Health as the focal point of
International Health Regulation.

[The patient appears to have initially exhibited the characteristic
symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease, caused by enterovirus 71
infection, which is frequently observed in children in South East
Asia. It is not clear from this report when the child developed
symptoms of respiratory disease. Further information and confirmation
by the World Health Organization are awaited.

If confirmed by the WHO this will be the 2nd Indonesian human case of
avian A/(H5N1) virus infection, and the 2nd fatality, in 2011 (see:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2011_03_10/en/index.html>.
