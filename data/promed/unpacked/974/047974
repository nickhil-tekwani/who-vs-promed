Deputy Commissioner Bajaur Usman Mehsood has said that the detection of 3 more polio cases in Bajaur in 2019 has further strengthened the resolve of the district administration to get rid of polio disease forever. He said this while addressing a news conference here on Friday [18 Jan 2019].

He said the administration would use all out efforts and resources to make the district free of polio, as polio disease has become a great challenge of the administration following the detection of new polio cases.

District Surgeon Dr Wazir Khan was also present on the occasion. The District Surgeon briefed the media about the arrangements of the upcoming anti-polio drive scheduled to be launched from [21 Jan 2019]. He said the health department has increased the number of polio teams for the upcoming polio drive in the district to make the drive more effective and productive.
