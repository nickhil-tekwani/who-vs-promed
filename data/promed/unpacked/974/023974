Chronic wasting disease found in a wild deer in Alberta
-------------------------------------------------------
Alberta's ongoing chronic wasting disease (CWD) surveillance effort has
identified the disease in a wild mule deer about 30 km south east of Oyen,
Alberta. The case was confirmed today by the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA).
A member of the public observed a very thin deer, which was subsequently
collected by a Fish and Wildlife officer from Alberta Sustainable Resource
Development. Before this case, there have been 3 cases of CWD found in
game-farmed animals in Alberta, and in Saskatchewan 68 cases in wild deer
and a significant number of elk found on game farms.
"This is an unfortunate finding in our wild deer population, but we are
ready with a comprehensive approach to limit the spread," stated Minister
David Coutts. "As we have been doing all the way along in managing for CWD,
we will be working closely with other departments and agencies, as well as
the public and our stakeholders, in a response to this occurrence."
Although this is a serious disease for Alberta's wild deer, and needs to be
dealt with promptly, there is no known health risk for humans. Fish and
Wildlife staff will meet with local residents to ensure they are fully
informed while a step-by-step approach is taken to dealing with this new
information. A limited collection of up to 50 deer in the immediate
vicinity of the infected deer is planned for late September or early
October 2005.
Surveillance for chronic wasting disease in wild deer and elk in Alberta
has been ongoing for almost 10 years, with hunter samples being submitted
over the past 7 hunting seasons and special collections in areas of
particular concern. About 6000 wild deer and elk from Alberta have been
tested for the disease with no trace being found before this case. Alberta
continues to be proactive in trying to manage CWD and is working with other
provinces and the federal government to develop a national chronic wasting
disease strategy and action plan.
