Two cases of equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) have been confirmed at the
Equine Hospital at Cornell University.

Both cases were found in horses that were already patients at the
hospital. But officials with the state Department of Agriculture and
Markets said 69 other horses at the site could have been exposed to
the virus.

EHV-1 is a common viral infection of horses that is highly contagious
and exhibits an array of clinical signs, ranging from none to
neurological disorders.

"While a common virus in horses, we are taking this situation very
seriously given the large number of horses that have potentially been
exposed to a highly communicable and sometimes fatal disease," said
New York State Veterinarian Dr David Smith. "To date, no other horses
have showed signs, nor tested positive for the virus."

One of the 2 cases was a 1-day old foal admitted to the Equine
Hospital 18 Mar 2011. The foal died 2 days later of pneumonia, and
tests revealed the presence of EHV-1 on 25 Mar 2011.

During the same time, a gelding was being treated at the hospital for
a spinal injury. It was discharged 22 Mar 2011, but became severely
ill and showed neurological symptoms after arriving back at its home
farm. This horse tested positive for EHV-1 on 30 Mar 2011. The gelding
is now recovering.

In response to the 2 confirmed cases, both the gelding's farm and the
Equine Hospital were quarantined immediately, restricting movement and
access to animals at both facilities. Horses at both facilities are
being monitored closely and having their temperatures taken twice
daily.

As part of this ongoing investigation, the department is working to
determine the source of the infection, as well as to identify and
isolate potentially exposed horses. In doing so, Cornell has been
contacting all referring veterinarians and the owners of 69 other
equine patients that may have been exposed while at the Equine
Hospital.

The Department of Agriculture and Markets also is talking with
private veterinarians to provide information related to this
situation, and is prepared to follow up on possible quarantines of
trace-out barns of the 69 potentially exposed horses, if necessary.

Nearly all horses in their lifetime will be exposed to EHV-1 at some
point, and therefore it is difficult to detect as it takes on a wide
range of manifestations, from a complete lack of clinical symptoms, to
pneumonia, to abortion in mares, to full-blown fatal neurologic
cases.

The virus does not persist in the environment and is neutralized by
hand soap, alcohol-based hand sanitizers and sunlight. Transmission of
the virus is mostly via direct contact with infected materials. EHV-1
does not affect humans or dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, or
birds; although alpacas and llamas can be affected.

If you are the owner or caretaker of a horse that has been at the
Equine Hospital at Cornell on or after 18 Mar 2011 or that may have
come in contact with a potentially exposed patient, the following
guidelines are recommended:

- Isolate your animal, if possible. It is always recommended that
horses returning from veterinary hospitals be isolated for 3 weeks
when possible.
- Check your horse's temperature twice a day for 10 days. If the
temperature is 102 deg F [38.9 deg C] or greater, contact your
veterinarian immediately.

If you care to test your horse, consult your veterinarian. At this
time, the preferred test is PCR analysis performed on nasal swab
specimens.

The quarantine at Cornell's Equine Hospital will remain in effect
through 11 Apr 2011.

[These are the cases and the circumstances that resulted in the
closure of the equine hospital at Cornell University.

It is interesting that a blog site has provided more in-depth
information regarding the situation at the College of Veterinary
Medicine than the press release from the university. - Mod.TG]
