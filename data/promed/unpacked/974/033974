The Kansas Department of Agriculture reported [Tue 22 Apr 2014] that a horse in northeast Kansas tested positive for a case of non-neurotropic equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) -- a virus that can cause respiratory diseases as well as neonatal fatalities and neurologic disease in infected herds.

Department officials did not reveal the location of the horse's home in northeast Kansas, but said the animal had recently participated in a barrel-racing event in Lincoln, Nebraska, where a Wisconsin horse also tested positive after attending the event.

Both horses were euthanized. Tissue samples of the Kansas horse were sent to the Kansas State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory last [Fri 25 Apr 2014], and results showed lesions consistent with EHV-1. Additional testing at Equine Diagnostics Services in Lexington, Kentucky confirmed the virus.

The agriculture department said it is not imposing restrictions on equine events or movements at this time, but it encouraged horse owners to take precautionary measures at upcoming horse events, such as calling ahead to see if the scheduled event is still taking place.

Horse owners are encouraged to monitor animals carefully for signs of the disease, including checking temperatures twice a day for changes and implementing good biosecurity practices for an equine facility.

Signs of the disease may include a fever, nasal discharge, wobbly gait, hind-end weakness, and dribbling of urine. The neurological form of the disease is often fatal.

The virus is spread by airborne transmission, horse-to-horse contact, and by contact with nasal secretions on equipment, tack, feed, and other surfaces. Caregivers can spread the virus to other horses if their hands, clothing, shoes or vehicles are contaminated.

[There appears to be a superficial link between the horse with this disease in Nebraska and this horse in Kansas. The article does not tell us of any epidemiological investigation, but it is certainly circumstantial that these cases are related. It also highlights the need for extremely strict biosecurity at shows. It also should make owners think twice about taking a horse to some gathering if the horse is even slightly "off". If the animal is giving you hints it is not well, then be wise enough to put your excitement and pride on the shelf and take care of your animal, or go to the event and leave the horse to recuperate "at home".
