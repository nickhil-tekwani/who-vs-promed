To date 5 hippos have died of suspected anthrax at Buyigi Island in
Kalangala district. The district is surrounded by Lake Victoria. The
death of the 5 hippos brings the death toll to 11 since the beginning
of July 2010. The leaders of Kalangala district say they have not
officially established whether the animals have died of anthrax.

Several hippos have died of suspected anthrax since June 2010. The
LCI [village council] chairperson of Buyigi Island, John Walakira,
says they have sent messages to their district headquarters about the
death of hippos.

He says they also expect the Uganda Wildlife Authority to investigate
the phenomenon. The chairperson also warns residents against grazing
their animals near the place where the hippos have died.

[These events in Uganda are becoming an unfortunate regular event, as
well as the problems of confirming the initial diagnosis. Considering
their size one might speculate at whether it might be possible to
stop outbreaks in a modest but discrete number of hippos by darting
them with Sterne vaccine. - Mod.MHJ]
