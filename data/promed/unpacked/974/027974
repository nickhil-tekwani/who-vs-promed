The skin disease [cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL] has this time surfaced in more than one union council (UC) of Upper Dir and has already turned into an epidemic in a span of 2-3 weeks.

Talking to The Express Tribune, Abdullah Shah said CL, locally known as kalusari dana, has been diagnosed in a large number of people in the district over the last few weeks. Shah was the former focal person for leishmaniasis in Upper Dir for the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) and is a medical technician at a Category D hospital in Wari.

He said the disease spreads via the female sandfly. "The affected people have lesions on their face, arms and legs." According to the World Health Organization, poverty and malnutrition play a significant role in the prognosis of the skin disease.

Shah said that in 2009-10, the disease only spread in Wari UC's areas, Kas, Bandaow, and Shang Tatogram. With ICRC teams present in the area, it was possible to control the outbreak by treating what were estimated to be around 500 patients, he added.

This time, however, the disease is not restricted to just one UC but is spreading to other UCs, such as Chaper, Sandal, Urban Wari, Urban Dir, Bibiwar, Barwal and Kohistan. "At least 40 to 50 patients of all ages have been coming on a daily basis for treatment, especially women," he said. But no particular arrangements have been made for leishmaniasis in Upper Dir as yet, and there is no current estimate about the number infected.

According to Upper Dir DHO Dr Iftikhar Ahmad, officials are still collecting data on the patients with the skin disease across the district.

Hospitalised patients have been prescribed Glucantim injections [Meglumine Antimoniate], priced at Rs700 [USD 6.82] each, which they are supposed to take for 21 consecutive days, making it an expensive treatment.

Two patients along with others have asked the government to provide them with treatment. Another patient told The Express Tribune that the disease will leave marks on their faces, which will also cause psychological trauma. However, according to Ahmad the scars will fade after the treatment is properly completed.

In an outbreak in February 2013, 1300 cases were reported from Khyber Agency.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Pakistan and especially in the eastern provinces bordering Afghanistan, where it is also highly endemic. A recent, comprehensive global review of leishmaniasis, including the situation in Afghanistan, can be found in: Alvar J, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PloS One. Published: 31 May 2012, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671, http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671#pone.0035671.s086.

The 2 types of leishmania causing cutaneous leishmaniasis in Pakistan are _L. tropica_, which mainly spreads from human to human, and _L. major_ which is transmitted from a reservoir in small rodents. Genotyping of leishmania from patients will help elucidate the focus of the present outbreak, and the main control efforts should target the sandfly vector. - Mod.EP
