NEW DELHI, Jan 2 (AFP) - A deadly virus, which killed more than
12 000 people in China in 1982, has been traced in some patients in
the eastern Indian city of Calcutta, a newspaper reported on
Saturday.
Scientists at the National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases
said they "stumbled upon" the B rotavirus during a routine
examination of patients in a city hospital, the Asian Age daily
said.
The virus had affected about a million Chinese during the 1982
Helonjiang epidemic and this was the first time that it was found
outside China.
No deaths have been reported due to the virus in Calcutta so far.
"At this stage of research, it is not possible to identify either a
particular zone or how the virus has managed to find its way into
the city," scientist Triveni Krishan said.
"The search is on to find a possible reservior of the virus."
Krishnan said the institute has decided to step up their
"surveillance programmes in other hospitals of the city to track
down the virus," which causes severe diarrhoea.

[Rotaviruses cause enteritis, with fever & vomiting. They belong to
the Reoviridae family. Group A is common in infants, group B is
uncommon in them, and group C is rare in all age groups. Groups B, C
& D also occur in animals, which may be the place to look for the
reservoir of this outbreak - Mod.JW]
