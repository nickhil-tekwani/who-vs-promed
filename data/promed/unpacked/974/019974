During the last week, 2 young men (20 and 30 years old) have died of rabies
in Kerala state in southern India according to newspaper reports. Both were
bitten by owned pet dogs. One animal was killed; the other died on its own,
but neither was further investigated. In one case no rabies vaccination was
taken but in the other only 3 doses were taken. In both cases the animal
bite was about 3 months earlier.
The adage "familiarity breeds contempt" is apt here. Dogs are common,
dog-bites are also common, and most of them are inconsequential. Rabies is
uncommon and people often do not take bites seriously. There may be several
factors involved in such negligent behavior: belief in pre-destiny or
fatalism; non-perception of personal risk; lack of authentic information
from Public Health staff; availability of non-scientific remedies;
inadequate health education in schools etc. Needless to say that such
tragic deaths are needless and preventable.

[ProMED-mail fully endorses Professor Jacob John's comments and welcomes
the opportunity to give them wider currency.
Rabies is a viral zoonosis; carnivores such as foxes and raccoons, as well
as many bat species, are wildlife hosts of the rabies virus in nature.
Globally, dogs represent the most important reservoir in terms of human
disease. Infection of humans usually follows bites by rabid animals and is
almost invariably fatal once signs of disease appear. More than 2.5 billion
people live in regions where rabies is endemic. It is estimated that each
year at least 50 000 people die from rabies, and more than 10 million
receive post-exposure vaccination. More than 99 per cent of all human
deaths from rabies occur in Africa, Asia, and South America; India alone
reports 30 000 deaths annually.
