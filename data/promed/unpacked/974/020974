On 8 Jun [2016], the NEW Zoo located near Green Bay, WI announced the deaths of 3 North American River Otters saying a mother and 4 of her pups were sickened by a rapidly-progressing gastrointestinal problem. Of the pups, 2 were saved, while the mother and 2 pups did not survive.

Today, thanks to the work of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory we now know that _Salmonella_ infection was the culprit that caused the otter deaths. According to veterinarian, Dr. Tracey Gilbert, the strain of _Salmonella_ involved was one that otters would typically survive after experiencing symptoms for a few days. However, the mother's body was under unusual stress as she was feeding the 4 pups, making her vulnerable to the infection. The strain is resistant to all but 2 types of antibiotics.

NEW Zoo officials say that the surviving otter pups are doing well and there is no sign of _Salmonella_ infection among any other animals at the zoo.

[It would be important to know which strain of _Salmonella_ is implicated, on which depends its zoonotic potential, or the risk to other animals. Common isolates from captive or rehabilitated otters in North America belong to the _Salmonella enterica_ group, which includes subspecies that can cause diarrhea in humans and livestock. - Mod.PMB
