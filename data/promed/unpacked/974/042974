Plague outbreak denied
----------------------
Algeria has dismissed reports that about 40 Al-Qaeda militants were
killed by an outbreak of bubonic plague at a secret training camp in
the country.

"No case of plague of any type has been recorded in any region of
Algeria since 2003," the health ministry said.

Reports had suggested that an Al-Qaeda offshoot had been
experimenting with the plague to create a biological weapon.
