Scientists are hurrying to understand why a new strain of the coronavirus that emerged in England in September 2020 appears to be spreading far more rapidly than earlier variants.

The early conclusion, according to British scientists, is that the virus has mutated to change the so-called spike protein on the surface of the virus, increasing the protein's ability to cling onto and enter human cells. These changes allow the mutation, known as N501Y, to spread 70% faster than earlier versions of the virus, early analysis suggests.

Neville Sanjana of the New York Genome Center says there is no evidence to suggest the variant has spread to the U.S.

Viruses mutate all the time, and coronaviruses less so than some others, such as the ones that cause influenza. Sometimes these accidental changes alter the attributes of the virus and sometimes not.

Scientists have identified 23 genetic changes on the new variant, an unusually large number, some of which are associated with changes in the proteins the virus makes.

The spike protein is located on the top of the spikes depicted on graphic representations of the virus and give it the crown-like appearance from which the coronaviruses get their name. The spike protein contains amino acids that use an enzyme in the body, called furin, to dissolve cell coatings and allow the virus to enter.

Three main questions are now being investigated: Is the new variant more contagious; Is it more likely to be fatal or cause serious illness; and Is it more likely to defeat the body's immune responses, including those encouraged by vaccines?

The provisional answers to those questions, as outlined by British scientific advisers on Saturday [19 Dec 2020], are yes, no and no.

Patrick Vallance, the British government's chief scientific adviser, said on Sat 19 Dec 2020 that 3 types of study -- of the virus's genetic makeup, statistics, and in the laboratory -- have come together to show that this variant is significantly more prone to be transmitted among people than earlier strains.

He said the variant had 1st occurred in September 2020 either in London -- where it was identified on 21 Sep 2020 -- or in the nearby county of Kent, where it was found on 20 Sep 2020. By mid-November 2020, 28% of cases in London were attributable to the new variant. In the week starting 9 Dec 2020, it was responsible for 62% of cases in the capital.

"It is becoming the dominant variant; it is beating all the others in terms of transmission," he told a press conference on Sat 19 Dec 2020.

A preliminary description of the variant, published online by scientists associated with a British effort to track genetic variations of the virus, suggested the new strain may have developed in someone suffering from chronic infection, possibly because of a weakened immune system.

Mr. Vallance said the conclusions that the mutation was less dangerous and unlikely to compromise the effectiveness of vaccines were preliminary. He said there were theoretical reasons why the new variant might alter the immune response, though there was no evidence so far that was the case.

"The working assumption is that the vaccine response should be adequate for this virus, but we need to keep vigilant about this," he said.

According to Dr. Sanjana of the New York Genome Center, "Single mutations will generally not alter vaccine performance."

British officials said they had no evidence the mutation was present abroad, though scientists say a similar mutation has appeared independently in South Africa.

England's health secretary, Matt Hancock, has told parliament that a new variant of COVID-19 has been identified and may be driving infections in the south east, leading to headlines about "mutant COVID."

What do we know about this new SARS-CoV-2 variant? It's been snappily named VUI-202012/01 (the 1st "Variant Under Investigation" in December 2020) and is defined by a set of 17 changes or mutations. One of the most significant is an N501Y mutation in the spike protein that the virus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor. Changes in this part of spike protein may, in theory, result in the virus becoming more infectious and spreading more easily between people.

How was the variant detected? It was picked up by the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium, which undertakes random genetic sequencing of positive Covid-19 samples around the UK. The consortium is a partnership of the UK's 4 public health agencies, as well as the Wellcome Sanger Institute and 12 academic institutions.

Since being set up in April 2020, the consortium has sequenced 140â€‰000 virus genomes from people infected with Covid-19. It uses the data to track outbreaks, identify variant viruses, and publish a weekly report (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/).

How common is it? As of 13 Dec 2020, 1108 cases with this variant had been identified in the UK in nearly 60 different local authorities, although the true number will be much higher. These cases were predominantly in the south east of England, but there have been recent reports from further afield, including Wales and Scotland.

Nick Loman, professor of microbial genomics and bioinformation at the University of Birmingham, told a briefing by the Science Media Centre on 15 Dec 2020 that the variant was 1st spotted in late September 2020 and now accounts for 20% of viruses sequenced in Norfolk, 10% in Essex, and 3% in Suffolk. "There are no data to suggest it had been imported from abroad, so it is likely to have evolved in the UK," he said.

Does this variant spread more quickly? Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on 14 Dec 2020 that initial analysis showed that the new variant "may be associated" with the recent rise in cases in southeast England. However, this is not the same as saying that it is causing the rise.

Loman explained: "This variant is strongly associated with where we are seeing increasing rates of Covid-19. It's a correlation, but we can't say it is causation. But there is striking growth in this variant, which is why we are worried, and it needs urgent follow-up and investigation."

Is mutation to be expected? SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, and mutations arise naturally as the virus replicates. Many thousands of mutations have already arisen, but only a very small minority are likely to be important and to change the virus in an appreciable way. COG-UK says that there are currently around 4000 mutations in the spike protein.

Sharon Peacock, director of COG-UK, told the Science Media Centre briefing: "Mutations are expected and are a natural part of evolution. Many thousands of mutations have already arisen, and the vast majority have no effect on the virus but can be useful as a barcode to monitor outbreaks."

Is the new variant more dangerous? We don't know yet. Mutations that make viruses more infectious don't necessarily make them more dangerous. A number of variants have already been detected in the UK. For example, the D614G variant is believed to have increased the ability of the virus to be transmitted and is now the most common type circulating in the UK, although it doesn't seem to result in more severe disease.

Public Health England's laboratory at Porton Down is currently working to find any evidence that the new variant increases or decreases the severity of disease. Susan Hopkins, joint medical adviser for NHS Test and Trace and Public Health England, said: "There is currently no evidence that this strain causes more severe illness, although it is being detected in a wide geography, especially where there are increased cases being detected."

Will the vaccine still work? The new variant has mutations to the spike protein that the 3 leading vaccines are targeting. However, vaccines produce antibodies against many regions in the spike protein, so it's unlikely that a single change would make the vaccine less effective.

Over time, as more mutations occur, the vaccine may need to be altered. This happens with seasonal flu, which mutates every year, and the vaccine is adjusted accordingly. The SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn't mutate as quickly as the flu virus, and the vaccines that have so far proved effective in trials are types that can easily be tweaked if necessary.

Peacock said: "With this variant, there is no evidence that it will evade the vaccination or a human immune response. But if there is an instance of vaccine failure or reinfection, then that case should be treated as high priority for genetic sequencing."

A new variant of the coronavirus has been detected in South Africa, health minister Zweli Mkhize announced on Friday [18 Dec 2020]. The variant was identified by South African genomics scientists from across the country, led by the Kwazulu-Natal Research Innovation and Sequencing Platform (KRISP). They have been analysing coronavirus genetic samples from different parts of South Africa since the start of the pandemic, and in recent weeks, these samples were dominated by a new variant.

Mkhize said the new variant is believed to be driving South Africa's 2nd coronavirus wave.

South African authorities believe the new variant spread from Nelson Mandela Bay through the Eastern Cape, to the Garden Route, and into KwaZulu-Natal.

The new lineage, named 501.V2, has between 10 and 20 new mutations not seen in the coronavirus tested in South Africa before end-September 2020.

The South African variant appears to be spreading more quickly, with higher viral loads than the original virus.

Clinicians have been providing anecdotal evidence of a shift in the clinical epidemiological picture, in particular noting that they are seeing a larger proportion of younger patients with no co-morbidities presenting with critical illness.

Here is what we know about the new coronavirus variant: There is no reason yet to believe symptoms are more serious or different. Authorities say there is no telling yet whether the new strain causes more severe symptoms than previous variants.

Dr Richard Lessells, senior researcher at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, says it is highly unlikely that patients will have different symptoms. But researchers are now urgently trying to confirm whether there are any changes in how fast and aggressive Covid-19 progresses in patients with the new variant.

The South African variant may have a mutation that could allow faster spread. Viruses mutate over time, but usually at a slow rate of around 2 per month. But scientists are now seeing between 10 to 20 mutations that were not previously seen at the end of September 2020.

Some of the mutations are likely to be irrelevant, but one, the N501Y mutation -- found in the new South African lineage, as well as a recent new variant discovered in the UK -- means the novel virus has a different spike protein.

That is how it binds to ACE2 receptors in humans, and the different configuration could be helping the new variants spread more quickly between people.

South African scientists speculate that the higher viral loads they're seeing on swab samples of the new lineage, compared to previous versions of Covid-19, could indicate it is more efficient at transmission.

Will current vaccines still work? Probably, but there are no guarantees yet. Two of the mutations in the new South African variant reduce virus sensitivity to some antibodies, meaning that these antibodies may not be as effective against this new variant. These mutations were not seen in new variants in the UK and Australia.

The South African mutations may have some consequences for whether the current international Covid-19 vaccines will be as effective against the new Covid-19 variant here.

Mkhize believes the already developed vaccines should still be effective against 501.V2, but though likely, that is not guaranteed just yet.

This new variant spreads faster, but it is too early to tell its severity and whether the current vaccine will work against this variant. We should, therefore, not panic and continue using the current intervention to stop the spread of #COVID19.

Researchers will now closely follow South African participants in the vaccine trials to see whether those exposed to the new variant still become sick.

Unlike in the UK and Australia, where their new variants are uncommon, South Africa's 501.V2 variant is widespread, and experts say it's driving the concerning 2nd Covid-19 wave in South Africa.

[RNA viruses exploit all known mechanisms of genetic variation to ensure their survival. Distinctive features of RNA virus replication include high mutation rates, high yields, and short replication times. As a consequence, RNA viruses replicate as complex and dynamic mutant swarms, called viral quasispecies [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9343347/]. It is important to understand this phenomenon at the basic level in relation to the impact of environmental factors as well as therapeutic or vaccine interventions.

For SARS-CoV2, the former may be more relevant at this time, as the vaccine rollout has just begun. However, the evidence so far indicates that even though the mutational events in the viral surface spike protein have improved transmission fitness of the virus, they are unlikely to undermine vaccine effectiveness. Many unknowns remain, so genomic surveillance and vigilance are key actions to continue, as virus can potentially mutate further in response to vaccine pressure.

[2] UK Stricter lockdowns
Date: 19 Dec 2020

https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/19/uk/christmas-covid-strain-restrictions-intl-gbr/index.html


The hopes of millions of Britons that Covid-19 restrictions would be eased over Christmas were dashed on Sat 19 Dec 2020, after scientists warned that a new strain of the virus is spreading more quickly than others.

UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a series of stricter coronavirus restrictions, tightening rules around household mixing that were due to be relaxed over Christmas in England, while leaders in Scotland and Wales also introduced more stringent measures. The UK has among the highest Covid-19 death rates in Europe, with more than 67 000 fatalities and over 2 million cases.

The PM broke the news that London, and large parts of southern and eastern England, where cases are surging, will enter Tier 4 restrictions, similar to a lockdown, on Sun 20 Dec 2020.

"The spread is being driven by the new variant of the virus," Johnson said in a hastily called press conference. "It appears to spread more easily and may be up to 70% more transmissible than the earlier strain."

England's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, warned on Sat 19 Dec 2020 that a newly identified variant of Covid-19 "can spread more quickly" than previous strains of the virus.

"This is now spreading very fast," Johnson warned. "It is with a very heavy heart that I say we cannot continue with Christmas as planned."

Johnson outlined that in Tier 4 areas under the toughest restrictions, there will be no possibility for household mixing over Christmas. In areas under lower alert levels in England, Scotland and Wales, mixing will now be permitted only on Christmas Day [25 Dec 2020].

Alert Level 4 restrictions will be brought forward to apply across Wales from midnight, the country's 1st Minister, Mark Drakeford, announced on Sat 19 Dec 2020, meaning that "festive bubbles" can be formed only on Christmas Day [25 Dec 2020], PA Media reported. Under Alert Level 4, people must stay at home except for very limited purposes, and must not meet other households or people they do not live with, while many businesses are required to close.

Scottish 1st Minister Nicola Sturgeon on Sat 19 Dec 2020 said that a strict travel ban would be implemented throughout the Christmas period north of the border, warning that people from Scotland should not visit other parts of the UK, and vice versa.

"In order to reduce the risk of more of the coronavirus strain being imported into Scotland, we intend to maintain a strict travel ban between Scotland and the rest of the UK," Sturgeon said.

Meanwhile, the toughest level of coronavirus restrictions will be applied to all of mainland Scotland for 3 weeks from 26 Dec 2020, she added. No changes in restrictions in Northern Ireland, which is set to go into lockdown on Boxing Day, were announced.

According to Whitty, the new variant is responsible for 60% of infections in London, which have nearly doubled in the last week. Earlier, he said "urgent work" is underway to establish whether the new strain, prevalent in the southeast of England, can cause a higher mortality rate.

"There is no current evidence to suggest the new strain causes a higher mortality rate or that it affects vaccines and treatments, although urgent work is underway to confirm this," Whitty said in a statement.

As with other new variants or strains of Covid-19, this one carries a genetic fingerprint that makes it easy to track, and it happens to be one that is now common. That does not mean the mutation has made it spread more easily, nor does it necessarily mean this variation is less dangerous.

Multiple experts in the genetics and epidemiology of viruses are noting that this one could be just a "lucky" strain that's been amplified because of a superspreader event; it could be that the mutation somehow makes it spread more easily without causing more serious illness; or it could just be by chance.

The government's scientific advisory group for Covid-19 has also warned that the new strain is a "real cause for concern," and called for urgent action. On Twitter, Jeremy Farrar said: "Research is ongoing to understand more, but acting urgently now is critical. There is no part of the UK & globally that should not be concerned. As in many countries, the situation is fragile."

Whitty also urged people to take more precautions. "Given this latest development, it is now more vital than ever that the public continue to take action in their area to reduce transmission," he said.

Daniel Altmann, Professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said the emergence of a new strain of the virus strengthens the case for all to get vaccinated as soon as possible. "The vaccines induce neutralising antibodies to several parts of spike ("epitopes"), and most of these would be unchanged by the mutations, so the vaccines will still work," the Science Media Centre reported.

Dr. Michael Head, Senior Research Fellow in Global Health at University of Southampton, agreed that surging case numbers mean that "dramatic interventions are essential."

"It has been obvious for some time that mixing of multiple households over the Christmas period will lead to a very difficult January [2021]," he said. "Therefore, this level of restriction is what should have been implemented at the time of the previous Christmas announcements, regardless of the impact of this new variant."

https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/news/covid-positivity-rate-dips-8-month-low-2013181


The rate of daily positive coronavirus cases dropped yesterday [17 Dec 2020] to 8.6 percent, the lowest it has been in more than 8 months, while the recovery rate continued to increase.

In 24 hours ending at 8:00 am yesterday [17 Dec 2020], a total of 13 191 tests were performed in 140 COVID-19 testing centres across the country and 1134 tested positive for the virus. 36 people died with the highly transmissible virus over the same period

The previous lowest daily positivity rate was on [10 Apr 2020], when 7.93 percent of 1184 samples tested positive for COVID-19.

The percentage of positive cases is a critical measure because it gives an indication of how widespread the infection is in the area where testing is occurring and whether levels of testing are keeping up with levels of disease transmission, according to Johns Hopkins University.

A high percentage of positive cases means that more testing should probably be done, and it suggests that it is not a good time to relax restrictions aimed at reducing coronavirus transmission.

As a rule of thumb, the positivity rate is thought to be "too high" if it is more than 5 percent.

In May [2020], the World Health Organization recommended that the positivity rate should be below 5 percent for at least 2 weeks before governments considered reopening.

"Although the positivity rate was decreasing in the last several days, it may rise at any time. In fact, the transmission will show both rising and decreasing trends in the coming days, as we observed during higher [rates of] transmission earlier (May-July 2020)," Mushtuq Hussain, consultant of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) told The Daily Star yesterday [17 Dec 2020].

Since the 1st 3 confirmed cases were reported on [8 Mar 2020] in the country, the transmission of COVID-19 was highest between June and July [2020].

The highest daily positivity rate of 31.91 was recorded on [3 Aug 2020]. It remained stagnant at around 12 percent throughout September and October [2020]. From November 2020, however, it started rising again.

Yesterday's [17 Dec 2020] infections took the total number of cases in the country to 496 975.

In the same 24 hours, 2239 patients recovered from their illnesses, raising the total number of recoveries to 431 590. This is 86.84 percent of all confirmed cases, up from 86.59 the previous day.

The number of deaths from COVID-19 was 36 over the 24-hour period, which is higher than the previous day's deaths, at 27.

The total number of COVID-19 deaths in the country now stands at 7192, which is 1.44 percent of all confirmed cases.

Among the 36 deceased, 27 were male. One of them was aged between 31 and 40 years, 2 between 41 and 50, 4 between 51 and 60, and 29 were above 60 years, according to the release.

The downslide in COVID-19 cases across the states continued even as India inched closer to the mark of one crore [10 million] total cases on [Thu 17 Dec 2020], with 26 691 fresh infections taking the country's caseload to 9 977 775.

Fresh infections were lower by nearly 2000 from the [Wed 16 Dec 2020] tally of 28 465 and by nearly 3000 cases compared to last [Thu 17 Dec 2020].

The decline was seen in fatalities, too, as 334 deaths were reported on [Thu 17 Dec 2020] compared to 357 the previous day.

Casualties this week have remained below 400 on all days so far, in contrast to last week, when they crossed the 400-mark on 4 days. India's cumulative toll reached 144 781 on [Thu 17 Dec 2020].

The slide in active cases continued for the 20th consecutive day, and the tally now stands at 313 127. However, compared to [Wed 16 Dec 2020], when active cases had dropped by more than 15 000, the decline in these cases was by less than 5000 on [Thu 17 Dec 2020]. The number of patients cured by the virus has reached 9 519 867, reflecting a recovery rate of 95.4%.

Kerala retained the top position among the states in fresh infections, with 4969 patients testing positive, followed by Maharashtra (3880 new cases), West Bengal (2245), Chhattisgarh (1584), and Uttar Pradesh (1539). Delhi, which had seen a huge surge in infections a few weeks ago, was at the 6th place with 1363 new cases. However, in fatalities, Delhi was at the 3rd spot with 35 fresh deaths, after Maharashtra (65) and West Bengal (44).

[The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 18 Dec 2020 at 05:52 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 9 979 447 / 144 829 / 104
Bangladesh: 496 975 / 7192 / 43
Pakistan: 451 494 / 9164 / 41
Nepal: 251 692 / 1749 / 60
Afghanistan: 50 202 / 2032 /52
Sri Lanka: 35 387 / 160 / 7
Maldives: 13 418 / 48 / 88
Bhutan: 442 / 0 / -

Over the last week, 6042 and 4774 COVID-19 cases were reported from Nepal and Sri Lanka, respectively, around 2000 lower in Nepal, but around 200 higher in Sri Lanka compared with corresponding records of the previous week, suggesting a declining trend in Nepal while a slightly increasing trend in Sri Lanka. The number of new reported cases is sharply declining in Bangladesh as the daily case-positivity has dropped below 10% at the end of the week. However, the number of daily deaths remained above 25, and the total number of deaths has recently crossed the mark of 7000. The daily new cases in Pakistan seemed to be stable or in a slightly declining trend after a temporal surge of new cases signaling a new wave. However, there are reportedly certain locations in Sindh province such as the central district of Karachi where the newly laboratory-confirmed cases are seemingly still increasing. The total number of COVID-19 cases in India is approaching to cross the grim mark of 10 million, but the good news is that the daily laboratory-confirmed cases are continuing to fall significantly. Over the week, India's daily new case count was below the mark of 30 000, grossly around 5000 less compared with the previous week.
