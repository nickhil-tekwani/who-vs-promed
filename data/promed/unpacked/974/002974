Dozens of people in rural parts of Uzbekistan have been infected with anthrax. Widespread cattle vaccinations are currently taking place all over rural parts of the country.

Farmers from Jizzakh province's Farishsky district have reported cattle vaccinations currently taking place in their area. They say that the obligatory vaccinations started shortly after the outbreak of anthrax occurred about a month ago [June 2014] in Surkhandaryo province.

On [18 Jul 2014], Bakhrom Norkobilov, head of the Veterinary State Agency at the Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources, was reported by online news agency vkurse.uz as saying, "Regional veterinary services have vaccinated about 14 million large and small cattle as well as other domestic animals in the past 6 months." Further measures include opening new slaughterhouses at points of meat distribution and sale, sanitary and medical control of people entering Uzbekistan, and inspections of transported cattle to ensure they have been properly vaccinated.

However, one should not rely on the latter too much.

"I was transporting goats to a nearby district when I was stopped by a traffic patrol for cattle inspection," says a farmer from the Farishsky district who declined to give his name. "I did not have any (vaccination) paperwork but for 40 000 soms (about USD 17) I was allowed to go through with all of my livestock."

And that is in light of real and serious reasons for concern. All the infected people in Farishsky district's Khusnobod village either bought or sold meat from infected cattle. More than 30 people have been hospitalized. Residents in Samarkand province's Vagashti village were infected several days after slaughtering sheep.

Bakhtier Niyazmatov, the country's Surgeon General, has cited the following statistics in the media: "There were 13 registered cases (of anthrax) in 1990, 31 cases in 1991. No cases from 2001 to 2005. 2-3 cases in 2006-2008. No fatalities registered as a result of anthrax."

If the official numbers are to be trusted, an outbreak of this magnitude has not occurred for over 20 years, since 1991.

According to this report, there is vaccination activity in Jizzakh region and probably elsewhere, and recent previously unreported cases in Surkhandaryo and Samarkand regions, and earlier this month (July 2014) in Syrdarya region; all of which ignores the many years of overspill from Farghona region into western Kyrgyzstan. A national control programme in eastern Uzbekistan is welcomed, even if long, long overdue. - Mod.MHJ
