The Greek Health Ministry yesterday instructed doctors to investigate the
unexpected deaths of at least 15 people in recent months to establish
whether they were caused by coxsackieviruses, potentially deadly enteric
viruses.
Health Minister Nikitas Kaklamanis instructed the Special Infections
Control Center (KEEL) to look into the sudden deaths, including one of a
3-year-old child, between last September [2004] and this March [2005]. Some
of the deaths have been attributed to inflammation of the heart muscle
(myocarditis) and the surrounding membrane (perimyocarditis), which are
symptoms of coxsackievirus infection.
3 years ago, an outbreak of coxsackievirus infection occurred in Greece,
resulting in the deaths of 3 people and another 46 being hospitalized. The
government was forced to shut down all educational establishments for 3
days to allay fears of an epidemic.

[Coxsackieviruses are classified together with the polioviruses,
enteroviruses, and echoviruses in the genus _Enterovirus_ of the family
_Picornaviridae_. The members of the genus _Enterovirus_ multiply in the
gastrointestinal tract but can also multiply in other tissues such as
nerve, muscle, etc. Coxsackievirus infections are usually asymptomatic, but
clinical manifestations include meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis,
myocarditis, and conjunctivitis. The coxsackieviruses have been associated
particularly with myocarditis and perimyocarditis; approximately 5 percent
of all symptomatic coxsackievirus infections are associated with heart
disease. The coxsackieviruses are an antigenically diverse group, and
currently 27 antigenically distinct virus species are recognized. The virus
species designated _Coxsackievirus_ B1 to B6 are those most strongly
associated with heart disease. The outcome of the investigation in Greece
is awaited with interest. - Mod.CP]
