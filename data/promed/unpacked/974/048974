Health Advisory: Human Anaplasmosis vs. Human Ehrlichiosis in
Minnesota and Wisconsin
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Human anaplasmosis (HA) (agent _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_) is the
2nd most frequently reported tick-borne disease in Minnesota and
Wisconsin, with recent averages of more than 250 cases reported
annually in each state. _A. phagocytophilum_ is transmitted by
_Ixodes scapularis_ (blacklegged tick or deer tick), which also
transmits the agents of Lyme disease [_Borrelia burgdorferi_] and
babesiosis [_Babesia microti_].

In recent years, MDH [Minnesota Department of Health] and WDPH
[Wisconsin Department of Public Health] have received increasing
numbers of positive serologic reports for human ehrlichiosis (HE)
(agent _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_). These reports were unexpected,
because the tick vector for HE, _Amblyomma americanum_ (Lone Star
tick), is uncommon in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

In 2009, Mayo Medical Laboratories detected a new species of
_Ehrlichia_ DNA in 4 patients (3 from Wisconsin, 1 from Minnesota)
using PCR [polymerase chain reaction]. The unique nucleotide sequence
is similar to _Ehrlichia muris_, a species not previously identified
in North America. These patients infected with the E. muris-like
agent (EML) presented with a febrile illness; 2 patients had a remote
history of prior organ allograft. All recovered with doxycycline treatment.

The EML organism has since been found in some _I. scapularis_ ticks
in Wisconsin, although it is not known whether this tick serves as a
vector. HA, HE, and EML infections cannot be differentiated
clinically without diagnostic tests. Some cross-reactivity exists
between these organisms on serologic assays, but not enough to
reliably substitute one for another. For example, HA patients who are
mistakenly tested only for HE using serologic tests may sometimes
appear to have negative results (since not all samples will
cross-react) and may ultimately be undiagnosed. In addition, some of
the recent serologic reports of HE received by the MDH and WDPH may
have been due to cross-reactivity with the newly identified EML organism.

Physicians need to understand the tests they are ordering and their
limitations. HA tests are still sometimes called a test for "human
granulocytic ehrlichiosis" by commercial laboratories, although this
terminology is outdated. Some health care providers also use this
terminology and incorrectly order ehrlichiosis tests. When diagnosing
HA, health care providers need to make sure the test they order
detects _A. phagocytophilum_ (or the agent of human granulocytic
ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis).

Since HA is the more common infection in Minnesota and Wisconsin,
physicians should routinely order HA tests. However, physicians
should consider the potential for locally acquired ehrlichiosis and
extend testing to cover Ehrlichia species when appropriate.

PCR is considered the gold standard for diagnosing these infections.
Currently, Mayo Laboratories offers a PCR test that can differentiate
the EML organism from the agents of HA and HE. PCR is most effective
when used during the 1st week of illness, and a negative PCR assay
should be followed up with an IFA [immunofluorescence assay] test if
clinical suspicion warrants.

A specific IFA test has not yet been developed for the EML agent and
the degree of cross-reactivity of this agent with HE and HA serologic
tests is unknown. Physicians suspecting infection with an _Ehrlichia_
species should order serologic tests for both HA and HE. IFA IgG
[immunoglobulin G] antibody tests are preferred because IgM tests may
be prone to false positives. To confirm the diagnosis, MDH and WDPH
recommend that an acute serum sample should be obtained within the
1st week of illness, followed by a convalescent serum sample obtained
2-4 weeks later. A blood smear may also be conducted on specimens
from acutely ill patients.

Currently, the recommended antibiotic treatment of HA, HE, and EML is
the same (doxycycline for adults and children), and patients should
be treated empirically. A complete course of treatment should be
given, even if early diagnostic test results appear negative.

[Ehrlichiosis are a group of tick-borne zoonotic diseases that are
due to rickettsia-like obligate intracellular bacteria and are
usually named according to the host species and the type of white
blood cell most often infected. In 2001, when the taxonomy of the
ehrlichiae was changed, the name of _Ehrlichia phagocytophila_ was
changed to _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and the name of the disease it
caused was changed from human granulocytic ehrlichiosis to human
granulocytic anaplasmosis
(<http://riki-lb1.vet.ohio-state.edu/ehrlichia/background/ehrlichiaspp.php>).

The name for human monocytic or monocytotropic ehrlichiosis and its
pathogen, _Ehrlichia chaffeensis_ remain unchanged. _Ehrlichia muris_
has been found in rodents in Japan (Wen B, et al. _Ehrlichia muris_
sp. nov. Identified on the Basis of 16s rRNA Base Sequences and
Serological, Morphological, and Biological Characteristics. Internat
J Syst Bacteriol 1998; 45: 250-254). Although not previously known to
be associated with any human disease, it can cause murine
monocytotropic ehrlichiosis.

Wright stain of peripheral blood smears or buffy-coat preparations
demonstrate stained cytoplasmic inclusions consisting of vacuolar
microcolonies of _A. phagocytophilum_ within neutrophils in 20 to 80
percent of patients with anaplasmosis, unlike the rarity of
visualizing organisms within circulating mononuclear cells in
patients with human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Weinberg G:
Laboratory diagnosis of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis. Pediat Infect
Dis J 2001; 20: 435-7.)

_I. scapularis_ transmits human granulocytic anaplasmosis, as well as
Lyme disease and babesiosis. Because of a common tick vector, a
patient infected with any one of these pathogens may be co-infected
with other pathogens that the tick vector may be concurrently carrying.

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ is disseminated in the blood stream, it
is not surprising that infected blood could serve as a vehicle for
person-to-person transmission. Indeed, _A. phagocytophilum_ can
survive in refrigerated blood, and anaplasmosis has been transmitted
through blood transfusion (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ Transmitted Through Blood
Transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57: 1145-8. October 2008
