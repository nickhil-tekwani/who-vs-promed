Ebola: As death toll approaches 2000, vaccines, treatment and behaviour change equally important
--------------------
The availability of an effective vaccine against Ebola and the recent confirmation of 2 effective treatments do not negate the importance of building trust and understanding in communities affected by the outbreak, warns the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

This warning comes as the death toll for the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) approaches 2000 and as the total number of cases reaches 3000.

Dr Emanuele Capobianco, IFRC's Director of Health and Care said:
"The importance of these new treatments -- and the continued roll out of vaccines -- are not to be underestimated. But alone they are not enough. Now is the time to double down on efforts to engage at-risk communities. For the treatments to work, people need to trust them and the medical staff who administer them. This will take time, resources and a lot of hard work."

Continued high levels of distrust mean that many Ebola patients are delaying or avoiding going to health facilities. This reluctance significantly decreases their chance of survival, even with access to the newest treatments. It also dramatically increases the risk that the virus will spread to family members and other care givers. More than 42 per cent of alerts that Red Cross receives to bury a loved one are coming from a death at home.

IFRC's Capobianco said:
"We are asking people to leave the safety of their homes when they fall sick and to go to an isolated cell in an Ebola treatment centre where their lives are in the hands of complete strangers. We are asking communities to change the way they care for the sick and the dead in ways that go against their traditions. And we are doing all this in communities that have learned to distrust outsiders following decades of violence and unrest.

This is our biggest challenge. It is a behavioural challenge, not a medical one. And unfortunately, there is no magic pill to change behaviours."

Two new treatments that are hailed as an effective cure against Ebola are currently being administered in Ebola treatment centres all over North Kivu and Ituri. IFRC believes that if people understand that the treatment can save lives and can reduce the risk of transmission to their loved ones, they are more likely to seek health care early.

In addition to community outreach and engagement, Red Cross volunteers continue to carry out around 20 safe and dignified burials every day. Volunteers and other burial teams have responded to more than 11 000 safe and dignified burial requests across North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

IFRC is appealing for about 43 million Swiss francs [USD 43.8 million] to continue safe and dignified burials and to support 15.5 million people with community outreach, prevention, and preparedness measures. So far, just over half of the amount needed has been received.

DRC Ebola cases continue steady climb as total reaches 2976
-----------------------------
Over the weekend and through today [26 Aug 2019], the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 40 more Ebola cases, with no reports of any from the closely watched areas of Goma, South Kivu province, and Pinga, where the virus recently spread, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard and other official sources.

The new cases including a spurt of 18 infections yesterday [25 Aug 2019] were detailed in a tweet by the WHO's DRC office. Reflecting cases recorded through 24 Aug 2019, the WHO said the 18 included 6 in Kalunguta, 4 in Beni, and 2 in Mutwanga. Six more locations each reported 1 case: Mabalako, Mandima, Butembo, Katwa, Kayna, and Komanda.

The new cases this weekend and the 8 new ones reported today [26 Aug 2019] push the overall outbreak total to 2976 cases. Health officials are still investigating 397 suspected Ebola cases.

Also, over the past few days, 17 more people died from their Ebola infections, pushing the fatality count to 1986.

In a separate tweet, the WHO's DRC office said the number of people vaccinated since last August 2018 has reached 204 772.

UNICEF DR Congo Ebola Situation Report North Kivu, Ituri and South Kivu
--------------
Highlights

On 15 Aug 2019, 2 confirmed Ebola cases were reported for the 1st time in South-Kivu province, in Mwenga health zone (Chowe). The same health zone reported a 3rd confirmed case on 17 Aug 2019. On 17 Aug 2019, 1 confirmed Ebola case was recorded in a new health area located 150 km northwest of Goma in Pinga health zone. To date, 29 health zones in 3 provinces have been affected by the Ebola outbreak.

- In Mangina, UNICEF took the opportunity of the Yira/Nande International Conference that took place from 10-18 Aug 2019 to mobilize the community and share Ebola prevention messages.

Moreover, an agreement between Mangina response teams and the Yira/Nande community was signed during the closing ceremony.
- Since 12 Aug 2019, UNICEF provided summer school centers with 20 recreational kits, reaching 11 876 children, including 3980 girls, with Ebola prevention messages in Nyankunde, Komanda, and Mambasa health zones, Ituri province.

Key Epidemiological Developments

Since August 2018, confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) continue to be reported both in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. During the reporting period, an additional province, South Kivu, was reached by the EVD for the 1st time.

As of 18 Aug 2019, a total of 2888 EVD cases were reported, among which 2794 confirmed and 94 probable cases. More than [two thirds] of EVD confirmed cases have died: 1938 deaths, among which 1844 confirmed and 94 probable cases (global case fatality ratio remains 67 per cent). During the reporting period (week 33), the number of new reported confirmed cases continued to decrease slightly from 68 cases in the previous week to 57 confirmed cases. However, while the intensity of transmission may have declined, there has been geographic expansion.

South Kivu province was newly affected by the EVD outbreak with 3 confirmed cases in the health area of Chowe in Mwenga health zone, 150 km southwest of the provincial capital Bukavu. The 1st 2 cases were a mother and her child who had been in contact with a confirmed case in Beni before travelling back to South Kivu. Both victims have died. The 3rd case is a contact of the 1st case. EVD has also spread to an additional health zone in North Kivu, Pinga, in the territory of Walikale.

The cumulative number of health zones that have reported at least one confirmed and/or probable case of EVD since the beginning of the epidemic has increased to 29 since the beginning of the outbreak. 18 of them (62 per cent) have reported at least one confirmed EVD case in the last 3 weeks. A total of 220 health areas have reported at least one confirmed or probable case of EVD since the outbreak began, of which 65 have been active in the past 3 weeks.

Beni and Mandima health zones remained the hotspots of the epidemic, with respectively 33 and 20 per cent of 215 confirmed cases reported during the last 3 weeks.

Among the new confirmed cases listed as contacts, the proportion of contacts followed on a regular basis in week 33 (31 per cent) decreased significantly compared to the week before (74 per cent), partly due to security constraints.

The proportion of community deaths among all confirmed cases of EVD continued to increase (26 per cent in week 32 vs 32 per cent in week 33).

Two additional health personnel have been infected by EVD during the last week, thus reaching 154 health staff since the beginning of the outbreak.

Of the total confirmed and probable cases with reported sex and age, 58 per cent (1672) were female.

- Fri 23 Aug 2019: changes needed
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/08/who-ebola-numbers-underscore-need-changes-funding

[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

WHO: Ebola numbers underscore need for changes, funding
------------------
Ahead of another visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak region, a top World Health Organization (WHO) official said today [23 Aug 2019] that, as Ebola cases approach 3000, there's a need to reflect on the numbers and change the direction of the outbreak.

At a media briefing in Geneva today [23 Aug 2019], Mike Ryan, MD, the WHO's executive director of emergency programs, said transmission levels have been substantial but stable over the past 10 weeks, but he said there are worrying extensions of the disease, and responders need donor funding to bring the outbreak under control.

Current challenges
---
Health officials are still seeing transmission in hot spots like Beni feed other areas, such as the recent cluster of cases in South Kivu province. "We're trying to look at how we can change that reality," Ryan said, noting that health officials are always working on ways to improve surveillance and the reach of vaccination efforts.

Though the vaccine is highly effective and 2 experimental Ebola treatments were found to be very promising, their impact is limited if patients aren't treated and if vaccinators can't reach contacts, either due to community resistance or insecurity, he said.

Ryan said another worry is the recently detected case in Pinga, a remote and insecure area northwest of Goma, involving a patient who doesn't seem to have any epidemiologic links to other Ebola cases.

One goal is to ensure that the case doesn't mark another spillover from an animal source, and genetic testing is underway to assess whether the virus in Pinga is a separate introduction or related to other outbreak activity, Ryan noted. Vaccination has begun in Pinga, and the WHO is discussing clinical management in the area with Doctors Without Borders, he said.

Funding gap, and new support announcement
---
Ryan said the price tag for the public health part of the response is USD 278 million, and the WHO has asked for USD 120 million. So far, the WHO has received USD 15.33 million, and officials believe USD 62 million are in the pipeline, based on donor pledges, resulting in a USD 60 million gap.

He said the WHO anticipated a new World Bank outbreak funding announcement.

In turn, shortly after the media briefing, the World Bank announced USD 50 million to close the funding gap through the end of September 2019. The amount includes USD 30 million from the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility and USD 20 million from the World Bank.

The World Bank said the grants are part of a larger financial package worth about USD 300 million that it announced in July 2019.

In a World Bank statement, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said, "WHO is very grateful for the World Bank's support, which fills a critical gap in our immediate needs for Ebola response efforts in DRC and will enable the heroic workers on the frontlines of this fight to continue their lifesaving work." He added that the WHO eagerly anticipates further funding from other donors to help sustain response operations through the end of the year [2019].

Eight newly confirmed cases
---
In other developments, the DRC reported 8 more cases today [23 Aug 2019], boosting the outbreak total to 2938, according to numbers reflected as of 22 Aug 2019 on the WHO's online Ebola dashboard.

Health officials are still investigating 413 suspected cases.

Eight more people died from Ebola, putting the fatality total at 1969.

[3] Response
- Wed 21 Aug 2019ust 2019. Bordering countries
[The Telegraph, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Anne Gulland, Global Health Security Correspondent]

Countries bordering Ebola-hit DRC among the least prepared to fight disease outbreaks
---------------
The countries bordering the region where an Ebola epidemic has been raging for the last year are among the least prepared in the world to deal with a disease outbreak, an independent analysis has found.

According to a review of countries' disease defenses, those neighbouring the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) scored the lowest in terms of ability to respond to an epidemic.

This is a huge worry in an area with porous borders and where the Ebola outbreak, 1st declared last August 2018, shows no sign of slowing down.

Burundi and South Sudan -- which neighbour the regions affected -- both scored just 30 marks out of a possible 100 in a scorecard assessing a country's epidemic preparedness.

The analysis, carried out by Resolve to Saves Lives, an initiative of United States non-profit organisation Vital Strategies, uses data from PreventEpidemics.org's ReadyScore.

A ReadyScore is a measurement of a country's ability to find, stop and prevent outbreaks based upon data collected from World Health Organization's Joint External Evaluations (JEEs). It is a voluntary, independent assessment.

Other countries neighbouring the Ebola-affected areas fared better. Rwanda, which sparked international criticism by temporarily closing its border with DRC when 3 cases of the disease were diagnosed in the frontier city of Goma, scored 59 out of 100 for preparedness. And Uganda, which managed to contain the disease after 3 cases emerged in June 2019, scored 51 out of 100.

But more recent WHO assessments have suggested that the countries neighbouring the Ebola outbreak have strengthened their ability to respond to the disease, and millions of dollars have been invested in preparedness since the epidemic began.

Other countries found to be unprepared to cope with an outbreak include Central African Republic -- which scored just 26 out of 100 -- and Republic of the Congo, which scored 28. Both these nations border the DRC but not the regions directly affected by the current outbreak. The DRC itself scored 35 out of 100.

Dr Tom Frieden, president and chief executive of Resolve to Save Lives, said that no country in the world was fully prepared to cope with an epidemic.

"Lower-income countries are much less prepared, and this is a risk to these countries and neighbouring countries, but also to the rest of the world," he said.

The assessment was launched in 2016, and when the 1st 65 countries were analysed last year [2018], just 9 nations were found to be well prepared.

Now, 102 countries have been assessed, and the analysis found that in total 28 per cent are not prepared for an epidemic, 57 per cent have more work to do, and 15 per cent are well prepared.

Not surprisingly, countries in the Americas and Europe were best prepared, scoring an average of 87 and 73, respectively.

However, researchers focused on low income countries and have only looked at 5 countries in the Americas and 15 in Europe. The UK carries out its own assessment of epidemic preparedness.

Dr Frieden said that shoring up disease defenses costs roughly USD 1.00 per person per year.

"That's not a lot of money. But if you're a country with 50 million people, that's USD 50 million you may not have. One thing that has become clear is that it's not easy to step up; it's going to take years.

"When it comes to addressing epidemics, the world has attention deficit disorder. When there's a crisis, resources flow in. But when the headlines fade, resources recede. It's hard to get the sustained commitment to building health systems to work and respond to health threats," he said.

Dr Frieden added that he was encouraged that countries in Africa were well engaged with the process and said Tanzania, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria and Senegal in particular had begun to step up their efforts.

"They have really taken this to heart and worked to improve their level," he said.

The new scorecards were released as the UK pledged an additional 8 million pounds [USD 9.8 million] to countries bordering DRC to help bolster their ability to stop transmission of Ebola.

The funding will deliver more temperature checks at border crossings, support Ebola treatment units, provide clean water and sanitation, and enable engagement with local communities to raise awareness of the dangers of Ebola.

International development secretary Alok Sharma said the funding would help prevent further spread of the disease.

"Livelihoods depend on people being able to cross borders safely, so it is essential we continue to put in place the tools to contain Ebola. If we don't, the outbreak will spread, and many thousands more could suffer; ultimately Ebola is a potential threat to us all," he said.

[Byline: Mark A. Green, Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development]

Opinion by Mark A. Green
-----------------
This week, I was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), where the deadly Ebola virus has killed nearly 2000 people, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO has been hard at work leading the world's response to this crisis. This is the 2nd-largest Ebola outbreak in history, and requires a robust, unified international response that goes far beyond the medical treatment of the disease's victims.

The United States has been the world's largest single-country donor to this crisis, with USAID contributing USD 136 million and other agencies providing extensive technical assistance since the outbreak began last year [2018]. We are working closely with the WHO and the international community, armed with the lessons learned and innovations developed during the 2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak.

As administrator of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and with support across the Trump administration, I deployed an elite disaster team to the DRC, comprising experts from USAID and the Department of Health and Human Services' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

At the heart of the challenge to contain and cure the disease is pervasive insecurity and community distrust.

Numerous conflicts and acts of violence, particularly in North Kivu and Ituri Provinces, hinder access to medical professionals and disrupt response operations. Some of the perpetrators are armed gangs vying for control of land and resources; some are extremists attempting to render areas ungovernable or to send political messages.

But the insecurity runs still deeper. Decades of corrupt, authoritarian rule during which communities were denied any meaningful voice in their government have undermined the Congolese people's trust in institutions. People living in desperate poverty have watched kleptocrats enrich themselves by selling off natural resources and diverting funds away from those in greatest need.

This has fueled sweeping distrust of outsiders, including, too often, heroic health care workers who are trying to manage the Ebola response. In order to enable the public health response to work effectively, the community distrust of domestic institutions and outside assistance must be addressed.

To start, the United States urges all parties to more earnestly engage nongovernmental organizations already on the ground in Eastern DRC, many of whom are trusted community health care providers, and they must be integrated into the broader Ebola response.

We also call for greater transparency from everyone involved in the response with respect to both data sharing and expenditures of funds, an effort that will increase buy-in from local communities and prospective donors. Additionally, we will continue to push for health workers to have all the tools they need to fight the disease. That includes deploying a robust vaccine strategy in at-risk areas of the DRC and in communities along the country's borders.

We will also call on other bilateral donors to do their part. The United States and the United Kingdom have been generous in supporting the WHO's efforts. The World Bank has also come through with significant resources. Others need to step up and step up fast.

The elite team already on the ground has supported vaccination campaigns, helped to improve laboratory diagnostics and assisted with testing and contact tracing.

We have also facilitated significant community engagement campaigns, which were key to ending the 2014 West Africa outbreak, including provisions for "safe and dignified burial" teams to minimize unsafe contact with remains that might still be infectious.

This week, the US Ambassador to the DRC Mike Hammer and I met with officials from the government of the DRC, urging immediate action to address the underlying issues impeding efforts to end the Ebola outbreak.

We welcome DRC President Felix Tshisekedi's efforts to forge a strong partnership with the United States government, while recognizing the need to undertake significant political and security reforms that will renew hope in the population for a more responsive relationship with the central government. President Tshisekedi's visits to the Ebola-affected region and recent steps by DRC's Ebola coordinator, Dr. Jean Jacques Muyembe, to improve coordination with the many stakeholders involved in the response are promising signs that the government of the DRC will continue to prioritize attention to the outbreak.

We are far from containing this disease, but, as the recently appointed United Nations Emergency Ebola Response Coordinator David Gressly has said, despite all the challenges we face, nothing is insurmountable. I agree, but know that long, difficult months are ahead.

[Byline: Moyiga Nduru]

The struggle against Ebola
----
China's decision to dispatch public health experts to Uganda and South Sudan to help prevent the spread of Ebola from the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) comes at a time when the international community is vaccinating the high-risk population in the DR Congo.

The UN World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the vaccine to be 97.5% effective, with more than 160 000 people having so far received the jab.

China's move to send health experts to Africa should be commended. Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month [July 2019] that 3 Chinese experts will work with and help South Sudanese health professionals prevent the disease from spreading to Africa's newest country.

So far, 2800 cases have been detected, including more than 1800 deaths, in the DR Congo, according to the WHO. The UN agency declared the Ebola outbreak in the DR Congo a global public health emergency in July 2019.

The virus, which was 1st detected in areas between Zaire, now renamed DR Congo, and Sudan (present-day South Sudan) in 1976, was 1st transmitted to humans by animals such as bats and our distant cousins, monkeys. Once infected, a patient develops fever, vomiting, headaches, external bleeding and organ failure. This could lead to death if not treated early.

It's about time China takes the lead in assisting developing countries. This is not the 1st time that China is assisting Africa in its fight against the disease. Last year [2018], Beijing sent 11 health experts to the DR Congo to contain an Ebola outbreak. Between 2014 and 2016, China sent more than 1000 experts to fight the largest outbreak of Ebola, which claimed more than 11 000 lives in the West African states of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. China donated 750 million yuan (USD 117 million) in assistance to those countries, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

One of the most commendable Chinese projects, which Gao Fu mentioned, was China's decision to help build a center for disease control and prevention, which included training of health experts, in Africa. China also agreed to help construct a center to prevent, control and research tropical diseases in Sierra Leone.

Disease control is crucial to tame Ebola's elusiveness. The virus always strikes without warning, anytime and anywhere. Ebola also knows no national borders and travels freely, infecting anyone it comes into contact with.

Beijing's cooperation with Africa will, therefore, prevent Ebola from reaching China's shores through people-to-people contact. With an increasing number of Chinese visitors traveling to Africa, Beijing has good reason to be wary. Figures compiled by the China Tourism Academy show that nearly 800 000 Chinese visited Africa in 2017. The Hurun's "Luxury Chinese Traveler 2018 Report" indicated that the number of Chinese visitors to Africa actually increased from 15% in 2017 to 29% in 2018.

A key-contributing agent to the spread of the disease is the porous African border that needs to be tightened to prevent the virus from spreading from DR Congo's North Kivu and Ituri provinces to Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan.

Africa's current borders are a result of European powers chopping up the continent and dividing it among themselves in the so-called Berlin Conference of 1885. Some families found themselves split among Rwanda, DR Congo and Uganda. This makes the management of Ebola almost impossible, as ordinary people with ties to a neighboring country often cross-national borders to visit relatives using unofficial routes known to their ancestors since time immemorial. During their sojourn, they could, unknowingly, carry the virus with them, leaving a trail of blood, death and tears in their wake. Tragically, this is one way the virus is spreading.

If the challenges around the porous border are not addressed, the 2 fatal cases reported in Uganda in June 2019 will continue to replicate in the sub-region, with tragic results.

The solution rests in engaging traditional leaders who play a major role in African societies. Chiefs know who enters and leaves their areas. The chiefs can, therefore, work with governments and international health organizations to help prevent the spread of Ebola.

The other area China can assist in is building up the DR Congo's health sector, which has virtually crumbled. Rebel activities in the North Kivu and Ituri provinces, as well as governance issues, poverty and cultural practices, which are rampant in the DR Congo, only fuel the spread of the disease.

There is also deep-rooted mistrust of health workers by local communities in the DR Congo. In July 2019, unknown gunmen murdered 2 local health workers in North Kivu, temporarily paralyzing the fight against the disease. This is a tragedy that must be addressed by all stakeholders in the fight against this deadly disease.

Fresh fighting breaks out in northeastern DR Congo: army
--------------------
Fighting has erupted again in the northeastern Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the army said on Sat 24 Aug 2019.

The Congolese army said it lost 3 soldiers and killed 20 militiamen in the unrest overnight Friday to Saturday [23-24 Aug 2019] in the Djugu area.

Authorities say at least 160 civilians died in Ituri in June 2019 in clashes between militias.

On 2 Jul 2019, President Felix Tshisekedi announced a major military operation in the province's Djugu and Mahagi territories, with the offensive extending to South Kivu province to put a "definite end" to the dozens of militias roaming the lawless, mineral-rich region.

The UN refugee agency has said instability has forced more than 300 000 people to flee their homes, with people escaping unrest in Djugu territory especially.

Tens of thousands of people died in clashes between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups between 1999 and 2003 in Ituri. Violence between the 2 communities also displaced some 350 000 in late 2017 and early 2018.

In a separate development, it was announced that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will visit Beni in North Kivu on 1 Sep 2019.

Ituri and North Kivu province, just to the south, are trying to roll back a major epidemic of Ebola that has claimed nearly 2000 deaths since 1 Aug 2018.

Both provinces sit on DR Congo's eastern border with Uganda.

In this context, the army also added that Brigadier General Jacques Nduru had replaced Major-General Marce Mbangu Mashita Marcel after 4 years at the head of military operations in North Kivu.

Congo has given over 200 000 people Merck Ebola vaccine: government
---------------------
Congolese authorities and health workers vaccinated more than 200 000 people against Ebola in August 2019, the government said on Sun 25 Aug 2019, using a Merck vaccine they hope will help rein in the world's 2nd worst epidemic.

Figures released by the government's Ebola committee showed that 204 044 people had been inoculated since 8 Aug 2019. A total of 1980 people have so far died in this epidemic, of 2950 people suspected to have been infected, clinically confirmed cases are a little lower, at 2845.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Wed [21 Aug 2019] it will fund the manufacturing of Merck & Co Inc's investigational Ebola vaccine called V920. Another vaccine by Johnson and Johnson is available, but authorities have yet to deploy it for fear of creating confusion among an already skeptical and sometimes hostile population.

"The only vaccine that has been used in this epidemic is (the one) ... manufactured by Merck," the committee statement said.

Ebola appears to be under control in the city of Goma in Congo, but it has flared in other parts of the country, where aid workers are combating insecurity and misinformation on social media.
