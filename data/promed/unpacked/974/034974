Health officials in Washington and Idaho say people should avoid eating raw clover sprouts from an Idaho producer after the sprouts were linked to 7 confirmed and 3 probable cases of _Escherichia coli_ illness in the north west. The cases include 5 people in Spokane County (Washington), 3 in Kootenai County (Idaho), and 2 in King County (Washington). All took ill in the past 2 weeks and 5 were hospitalized. 9 of the 10 individuals reported eating sprouts in sandwiches served at restaurants about 5 days before they were sick.

The initial investigation indicates a strong link to spouts supplied by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts of Moyie Springs, Idaho, near Bonners Ferry, the Washington and Idaho state health departments said. "We advise people not to eat raw clover sprouts from Evergreen Fresh Sprouts until further notice," said Dr Kathy Lofy, Washington's state health officer. "If you have these products at home, you should throw them out." Panhandle Health District recommended people avoid eating raw clover sprouts, but the public health agency for North Idaho chose not to name the producer or any of the restaurants where the patients ate sprouts.

"What we have is a lot of circumstantial evidence that certainly says something. But we don't have final test results yet," said Cynthia Taggart, Panhandle's public information officer. "We just want people to know that all the people had the raw clover sprouts and they all got _E. coli_."

David Scharf, owner of Evergreen Fresh Sprouts, said state health officials jumped the gun pointing the finger at his business. "I find that it is very ambiguous to say that my product is bad," Scharf told The Spokesman-Review. He said he tests his sprouts before they leave the warehouse and also tests the spent water, according to federal rules. "I have documentation stating my sprouts are good."

Evergreen was singled out in similar investigation in 2011 when the FDA demanded it voluntarily recall products as a salmonella outbreak unfolded, sickening 25 people in 5 states. Test results showed no bacteria were found in the Evergreen produce at that time, but the FDA stuck by its conclusion that the business was the origin of the outbreak.

The clover sprouts suspected in the current _E. coli_ O121 outbreak were eaten in sandwiches at Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches in King and Spokane counties, 2 Pita Pit locations in Spokane County, and Daanen's Deli and a Jimmy John's in Kootenai County, Washington state health officials said. The restaurants voluntarily suspended serving sprouts, officials said.

Raw clover sprouts also are sold in delis, supermarkets, and specialty food stores. Public health officials advised people who have raw clover sprouts at home to throw them out. "Until the investigation is complete, we recommend that people avoid consuming raw clover sprouts," said Mary Petty, Panhandle Health District's epidemiology program manager.

Public health officials in the region are working with the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to investigate the cause of the illness.

[The enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) serotype is identified as O121, one of the non-O157 EHEC serotypes. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6), O26 being the implicated strain in this outbreak.

Sprouts are a very notable vehicle for EHEC. Sprouting generally involves germinating seeds (which may be contaminated) at temperatures higher than ambient temperature facilitating a higher bacterial inoculum. Sprouts have been the vehicle for 2 notable outbreaks. In July 1996, almost 10 000 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 occurred primarily in schoolchildren in Sakai City, Osaka, Japan, transmitted by white radish sprouts (7). During 2011, an outbreak centered in northern Germany (8) involved a chimeric, non-zoonotic EHEC/EAEC _E. coli_ O104:H4 spread by fenugreek sprouts and infecting almost 4000 people. This unique outbreak produced one of the largest number of deaths ever reported from a Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_, more than 50.
