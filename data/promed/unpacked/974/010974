Malaysia finds fresh case of bird flu
-------------------------------------
Malaysia's hope of declaring the country free of bird flu was dealt a blow
after new tests showed chickens in a northern village have been infected with
the disease, veterinary officials said on Tue, 23 Nov 2004.
Malaysia had been expected to make the much-awaited announcement this month,
as it has been more than 21 days since the last case of the virus was
detected on 10 Oct 2004.
But laboratory tests on poultry samples taken about 2 weeks ago from a
village in the northern state of Kelantan detected the H5 strain of avian
influenza, which only affects birds, said Veterinary Services Department
Director-General Hawari Hussein. More tests needed to be done to confirm
whether it was the H5N1 strain of the virus that is known to infect humans,
he told Reuters.
Hawari said some 200 birds in the village had been culled as a
precaution. "As a result, the move to declare Kelantan totally free of the
avian flu will only be made when the ongoing surveillance no longer detects
any more H5 virus and clinical signs," he said. "We are in no hurry."
Hawari said the threat was still considered high, as the disease remained
active in neighbouring countries. Malaysia reported its 1st case of bird flu
in mid-August [2004] after 2 fighting cocks were found dead in Kelantan. The
entire state was later placed under quarantine.
Malaysia, which has yet to have a human case of bird flu, has contained its
outbreak in one state and kept it out of commercial poultry farms. The
country's poultry industry reported losses of millions of ringgit due to the
disease following import bans by Singapore and other countries. Singapore
partially ended the import ban in September.
The virus has forced the slaughter of more than 100 million birds across Asia
and killed 32 people in Thailand and Vietnam [thus far] this year [2004].
