[This is the 2nd FMD event reported by Botswana during 2015.

In March 2015, Botswana reported foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the Ngamiland, [North West District], located in Zone 2d. Serotype SAT2 was identified. 5 outbreaks were reported in cattle, and 51 821 cattle were vaccinated in response to these outbreaks. The vaccine applied was a Trivalent SAT 1, 2 and 3 vaccine.

The last follow-up report submitted by Botswana for this March 2015 event was on 2 Jul 2015. That follow-up report (Report no 10) indicates that the event continues. According to the epidemiological comments: "The last outbreak recorded was that of Hallelujah crush on 17 Apr 2015. Surveillance in the outbreak crushes in the past week has revealed no clinical cases of FMD. Cattle were identified and visually inspected in the grazing areas and watering points but no evidence of clinical disease was seen. Epidemiological investigation continues and weekly reports will be given." The report and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000018036_20150702_145545.pdf
