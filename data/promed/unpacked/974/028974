Suspected Ebola Fever Outbreak Kills Seventeen in Congo
-------------------------------------------------------
Medical experts traveled to central Congo on Thursday to investigate the
deaths of 17 people with Ebola-like symptoms, state radio said. The deaths
began on 17 Nov 2001 in Dekese, a small village about 435 miles east of
Congo's capital, Kinshasa, UN officials said. At least 30 people, including
the 17 dead, exhibited symptoms similar to Ebola hemorrhagic fever, said
Auguy Ebeja, a doctor with Medecins Sans Frontieres. "It is a hemorrhagic
fever, but we still have to check whether this is Ebola fever or not,"
Ebeja said. "We are getting prepared to deal with an emergency situation."
Teams from Medecins Sans Frontieres and the health ministry accompanied the
World Health Organization to the affected area in Western Kasaai province,
the radio reported.

Hemorrhagic fevers, which include Marburg and Ebola, cause high fevers and
internal bleeding. Congo's last major Ebola fever outbreak struck the city
of Kikwit in 1995, killing 245 people. Kikwit is 215 miles south of Dekese.
An Ebola outbreak in Uganda killed 173 people last year. The disease was
named after a river in Congo, where it was first identified in 1976.

[This report and that from neighboring Gabon suggest the resurgence of
Ebola fever in this region. However, hemorrhagic fevers are caused by
various agents and confirmation by laboratory diagnosis is essential. -
