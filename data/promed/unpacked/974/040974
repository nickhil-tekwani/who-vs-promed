The 1st presence of the longhorned tick in Arkansas has been confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).

According to the Arkansas Agriculture Department, the tick came from a dog in Benton county.

The longhorned tick is an exotic East Asian tick considered by the USDA to be a serious threat to livestock because heavy tick infestations may cause stunted growth, decreased production, and animal deaths.

The tick is associated with bacterial and viral tickborne diseases of animals and humans in other parts of the world.

In other countries, the longhorned tick has been implicated in causing disease in humans, including severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome.

The nymphs of the longhorned tick are very small and resemble tiny spiders and can go easily unnoticed on animals and people.

This tick is known to infest a wide range of species and has the potential to infect multiple North American wildlife species, humans, dogs, cats, and livestock.

People can protect themselves, their children, and pets from ticks by using standard prevention methods such as wearing Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] approved repellents, performing tick checks, and tucking in clothing.

[Since this is the 3rd instance of occurrence of the longhorn or bush tick (_Haemaphysalis longicornis_) in the eastern USA, one wonders whether this tick has become established in this region. The report above does not mention if the dog from which the tick was recovered had a travel history outside of the county and state. With discovery of this tick in widely divergent localities in the USA in the past 7 months, one wonders if it is being moved via birds.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in the area in Arkansas to find out whether there are additional bush ticks in the area. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
