The number of hantavirus [infection] cases increases to 18, after the Institute of Public Health confirmed one case in the Bio Bio region and another in Los Lagos.

In order to decentralize the diagnostic capacity of the Ministry of Health, this Friday [17 Feb 2012], [this capacity will now include] 5 of the most capable laboratories in the country.

The [new] case in the Bio Bio region was a 21-year-old young man, who had contracted the infection in a supermarket where he worked as a restocking clerk. He is in serious condition in the Concepcion Regional Hospital.

The 2nd case is a 20-year-old young man from the city of Maullin, in the Los Lagos region, whose case [as a hantavirus infection] was confirmed by the [Molecular] Microbiology Laboratory of the Universidad Austral of Valdivia.

These 2 news cases related to the virus are added to the 16 previous ones, and the Institute of Public Health hopes that the number will not increase. For this reason, together with the Ministry, on Friday [17 Feb 2012], the last of the 5 diagnostic laboratories was inaugurated.

Officials confirmed that there is a new case of [a] hantavirus [infection ] in the Bio Bio region. The case is a young man of 21 years from the Arauco community, who is in serious condition in the intensive care unit of the Guillermo Grant Benavente Hospital in Concepcion, where he is receiving medical attention with ventilatory assistance.

Given the suspicious symptoms [of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome] a rapid test was positive and was later confirmed by the Institute of Public Health.

With this case, hantavirus [infections] now total 6 this year in the Bio Bio region. Of these, 3 were fatal, 2 of whom were inmates of the Manzano prison -- where there was an outbreak -- and a 3rd victim was from Tucapel.

A young, 20-year-old shrimper from the Carelmapu locale was confirmed as the 2nd case of [a] hantavirus disease in our region [Los Lagos] in 2012, according to results of a sample tested by the Molecular Biology Laboratory of the Universidad Austral in Valdivia.

The affected individual was taken on Saturday [18 Feb 2012] to the intensive care unit of the Hospital Base in Valdivia, only because of the availability of a mechanical respirator there, per norms for this condition. Happily, the progression of the clinical picture was mild and did not require this procedure [mechanical ventilation].

According to the epidemiological and environmental investigation carried out by professionals from the Health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit] the possible focus of infection related to a wooded area between Carelmapu and Maullin, around the road, where the inhabitants of the area commonly collect pangues, nalca leaves [_Gunnera tinctoria_], with which they traditionally prepare curanto [a typical dish of this area in Chile].

In the Maule region, there are now 3 cases of [a] hantavirus [infection]. The 1st, with a fatal outcome, was in the Potrero Grande area of Curico. Later there was a case in a child from Constitucion and the 3rd a 48-year-old woman, who is currently a patient in stable condition in the Talca Hospital.

This affected woman resides in the Bajo Perquin area of San Clemente from epidemiological surveillance and health [studies] must have become infected in her place of residence. To [these 3 cases], 2 suspected hantavirus [infection] cases are added -- a 47-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy. Of these, the 1st is in serious condition in the intensive care unit of the Maule Hospital and the child is in stable condition in the 2nd Children's Unit in the same hospital.

The 3rd confirmed case of [a] hantavirus [infection], as with the 2 suspected cases, is from the San Clemente community. Given this, the Health SEREMI, Hans Lungenstrass, visited the residence where the infection occurred and the field where the 47-year-old woman worked, and where the infection was acquired from the long-tailed [rodent; the long-tailed pygmy rices rat, Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_).
