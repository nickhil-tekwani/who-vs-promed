MECHANICAL TRANSMISSION BY MOSQUITOES (5)
=========================================
[See: "Mechanical transmission of viruses", promed archive.960314]
It was a pleasure to read the knowledgable and thoughtful remarks of Ian
Marshall on several topics in the 13 March posting. I would like to propose
a couple of footnotes to his material.
1. There are several circumstances in which mechanical transmission of
viruses by mosquitoes has been suggested and seems quite plausible even
though there is no doubt of the true biological relationship of the viruses
to mosquito vectors. In each circumstance the viruses are found in very
high titers in their host's blood and they have a low infectious dose after
injection. The prevalence of Chikungunya virus antibodies clustered in
dwellings in an African study, which of course may be due to limited flight
range of vectors but also could be a reflection of mechanical transmission.
The possibility is made more credible by the high viremia of infected
humans and the demonstration of mechanical transmission of virus by Ae
aegypti in mice with similar or lower levels of viremia. The same
transmission mode has been suggested as a contributing factor to the
explosive nature of some Chikungunya epidemics. Rift Valley fever also
reaches high titers in infected domestic animals and humans, is very
infectious by injection, and is associated with brusque epidemics. The
efficacy of mosquitoes and other arthropods in transmission between infected
hamsters has been convincingly shown in the laboratory setting. Finally,
Venezuelan encephalitis virus, which is biologically transmitted by
mosquitoes has been transmitted by black flies in the laboratory and these
flies have been implicated in at least one field epidemic.
2. Much is made in the popular press and in Promed comments about the
"requirement" for a virus not to kill its host. Ian Marshall makes the point
that there are a number of variables that determine the outcome of the
interaction of a virus with its newly found host species and that the
outcome is not neccessarily a comfortable steady state between host and
virus. The myxomatosis/rabbit experience in Australia is clearly a very
important system for study and I would guess that the mutual adaptation of
the virus and the host may be relevant to many viruses and their reservoirs.
The original myxomatosis studies, however, pointed out the need for a
critical balance between transmissability and virulence. Viruses that
became too attenuated would die out because of insufficient virus in the
skin lesions to maintain virus circulation. Anderson and May have provided
a mathematical treatment that shows the interplay among the virulence,
transmissability, and survival of a parasite such as a virus or protozoan in
a host population. This model shows the conceptual relationship in which
increase in virulence is favored if it leads to increased transmissability.
Most of the systems we study are in a "steady state" and this may
artificially highlight virus-host relationships that reach such a detente.
If a virulent virus emerges in a particular species and kills in excess of
its ability to propogate, this virus will die out but it could leave large
numbers of dead hosts in its wake, an unpleasant proposition for the host
and an outcome that could be measured in days or in years. Since there are
no fossil viruses we would not have access to past viruses for study. I
would speculate that virus extinction through a brutal period of excessive
mortality on its host may happen more often than we suspect. The dynamics
might resemble those of measles in an isolated population. After all, the
immune measles survivors are "dead" to the virus although they are not
reproductively dead in the long term.
Once again speculatively I would wonder if the extinction of the host
species would be much rarer than that of the virus unless the host is
already circumscribed in geographic distribution and genetic variation. We
may be seeing examples of this threat in lions and cheetahs.
Another argument that is probably often correct but not truly general is
that of the virgin soil epidemic. These are usually held to be more
severe because the host lacks some resistance or immunity, but the
hypothesis and the data usually do not discriminate among specific immune
responses, genetic factors in resistance, and other complicating factors.
The greater challenge to the generality of the assertion is that
ascertainment bias is almost certainly at work in that virgin soil epidemics
that are mild are unlikely to be noticed and commented upon.
3. I would also like to mention that we have all seen examples where
the virologist serves as vector for serial intraspecies transfer of a virus
strain, usually between mice or guinea pigs. The commonest outcome is a
"heating up" or increase in virulence of the virus for the species
inoculated. At very high passages there may be an attenuation of the virus
in some systems, but this cannot be reliably expected or predicted. Some of
the successes such as 17D strain of yellow fever or the Smithburn strain of
Rift Valley fever are well known and very useful as human or veterinary
vaccines, but the failed attenuation attempts of yellow fever or the high
domestic animal virulence of Rift Valley fever passaged intraperitoneally
instead of intracranially are not usually discussed.
