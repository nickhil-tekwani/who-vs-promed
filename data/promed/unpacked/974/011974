Virus Outbreak on Disney Cruise Ship
------------------------------------
Around 100 passengers on a Disney cruise ship have contracted a contagious
gastroenteritis virus. The outbreak comes after more than 500 people on
another cruise ship came down with a similar illness.
Passengers and crew members on the Disney Cruise Line ship Magic became ill
on Wed 20 Nov 2002. The ship, which departed on 17 Nov 2002 from Port
Canaveral, Florida, with 3200 people on board, returns on Sat 23 Nov 2002.
Disney will clean and disinfect the ship at sea. The company's terminal and
other locations will also be cleaned. Sick passengers will be offered
compensation, but there are no plans to cancel any scheduled cruises aboard
the Magic.
Disney made the announcement as Holland America's cruise ship Amsterdam
returned to port for cleaning after more than 500 people on its last 4
voyages became sick. The ship had been due to leave on a 10-day Caribbean
cruise yesterday, but it was cancelled. During the next 10 days, crew
members will replace 2500 pillows and dry-clean, steam-clean, and disinfect
every surface aboard the ship, which is 780 ft long and has 690 staterooms.
On the cruise, passengers were barred from serving themselves at buffets or
touching any food or drinks but their own.
