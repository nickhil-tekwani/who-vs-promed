The owners of a stud horse worth thousands of dollars that contracted a mosquito-borne virus after travelling to Griffith are warning residents to be alert for signs of illness.

Veterinarians at Wagga Wagga's Charles Sturt University (CSU) Equine Centre are treating the stallion, but it is not yet known if it has Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) or the West Nile virus, which both come from mosquitoes.

Owner [VS] said there were several other horses that had been taken to the CSU vets in Wagga with similar neurological signs to those her horse had been experiencing.

"They have sent blood samples to Queensland for testing to see if it is JEV, but because of the floods, it may take a while before the results come back," [VS] said.

The West Nile virus and JEV are similar with regard to causing similar signs. However, JEV is more severe and, given that the horse seems to be recovering, vets are thinking it may be the West Nile virus.

[VS] urged horse owners who have been in or around Griffith to be vigilant for the onset of signs. Signs to look out for include fever, jaundice, lethargy, anorexia, and neurological signs, which vary with severity of the disease.

The horse remains away from his Cootamundra home in Wagga in the intensive care unit. He has begun to eat and drink again and is displaying some signs of recovery.

[VS] said it was a huge shift from his condition on Saturday [12 Mar 2022], when it was looking as though they might have to say their goodbyes.

"You have to be on top of it," [VS] said. "It's a race against the clock."

[VS] said another horse that had also travelled to Griffith and was treated by CSU vets in Wagga for the same signs as her horse hadn't been as lucky and passed away.

[VS]'s horse first began displaying signs something was wrong on Saturday [12 Mar 2022]. [VS] and her husband, [JS], took immediate action and brought him to the CSU clinic in Wagga the same night.

"I want to stress to other horse owners to not muck around," [VS] said.

[VS] and [JS] had only taken quick action due to how unusual their horse had been acting, and it was likely that getting him to professional help in a timely fashion played a huge role in his progress so far.

"We had thought maybe he had been bitten by a snake or had pinched a nerve in his back," she said.

[VS] said horse owners across the Riverina should look into the different ways in which they can protect their horses from mosquito-borne viruses, including full body and head rugs, and insect repellent for the animals.

["West Nile virus [WNV] signs in horses
- The most common signs of WNV infection in horses include stumbling, in-coordination, weak limbs, partial paralysis, muscle twitching, and in some cases, death. Fever has occurred in less than 1/4 of all confirmed equine cases.
- Each horse may exhibit a combination of symptoms or not exhibit any symptoms.
- Once a horse has been bitten, it may take only 5-15 days for signs of West Nile virus to appear. Horse-to-horse transmission does not occur.

"Treatment
- Treatment is vital for any horse with WNV. Since there is not any specific antibody to counterattack the virus, it is important to consult your veterinarian and provide supportive therapy. The effect the virus has on each individual horse will determine if home or clinical care is warranted. Each animal is assessed according to its age and health, and all treatments should be under the direction of a veterinarian.
- Recovery times depend upon the health and age of the affected horse. Many horses will improve within 5-7 days of displaying clinical signs; however, about 20-30% can exhibit severe neurological deficits for several weeks.
- In cases of WNV, 33% will die, 50% will fully recover, and 17% will have relapse or incomplete recovery.
- Treatment includes treating a fever if present.
- Ensure horse receives sufficient fluids, possibly through intravenous treatment if the horse is unable to drink on its own. Oral or intravenous feeding may also be necessary for horses unwilling to eat.
- For horses unable to rise, slinging is recommended 2-3 times per day to aid in circulation and to try to prevent pressure point sores (bedsores).
- Head and leg protection is also frequently needed.
- Horses with WNV sometimes develop other problems because they were weakened by WNV. Joint and tendon infections, sheath infections, pneumonia, and diarrhea can all occur as secondary events.

"Prevention
- Horse owners should consult their veterinarians regarding vaccination. The vaccine shots are of no value if they aren't given prior to exposure to the disease. If the horse develops WNV, it is too late for the shot.
- The vaccines require 2 doses, administered 3-6 weeks apart, and full protection doesn't develop until 4-6 weeks after the 2nd dose. Sometimes a 3rd does is recommended. Boosters are recommended, but recommendations vary and depend upon mosquito infestation where you live. It can take 7-12 weeks for the horse to develop maximum resistance to infection.
- To eliminate mosquito breeding habitats: Eliminate any unnecessary standing water on your property (tires, wheelbarrows, old buckets, etc.); make certain roof gutters drain properly and remove any standing water, especially from flat roofs; and keep swimming pools clean and free of water on covers.
- Stable horses inside during active mosquito feeding times (dawn/dusk); utilize fans, barrier cloths, screens, flysheets, repellent sprays (permethrin, DEET), and insecticide misting systems; turn off lights that attract mosquitoes at night or use fluorescent lights, which do not attract mosquitoes."

"Japanese encephalitis
Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an acute arbovirus disease which causes encephalitis in horses and humans, and abortion in pigs. It is caused by infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a mosquito-borne virus that occurs in widely dispersed areas in eastern Asia, including Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. The virus was introduced into the Torres Straight Islands in 1995 and to the Australian mainland in 1998. JE originated in Japan, with 1st known outbreaks occurring as early as 1871; the virus was first isolated in 1935.

"Three types of manifestations of JEV can occur: transitory, lethargic, or hyperexcitable.

"Clinical signs, if present, vary; disease usually presents itself in sporadic or localized clusters.

"How JE is transmitted to horses:
The virus is transmitted to horses through biting insects. One of the main mosquito vectors is _Culex annulirostris_ in Queensland, Australia.

"Clinical signs
- lethargy
- loss of appetite
- fever
- difficulty swallowing
- ataxia
- transient neck rigidity
- impaired vision
- aimless wandering
- violent and demented behavior
- profuse sweating
- muscle tremors
- staggering and falling
- loss of appetite
- collapse
- death

"Diagnosis is based on history, clinical signs, physical exam, and laboratory tests."

"Report disease
JE is a reportable disease, meaning if you suspect your horse has this disease, by law you need to report it to your veterinarian, or a state or federal veterinarian."

[Supportive care for your animal is needed. Consult your veterinarian.

Prevention consists of vaccination and biosecurity.]

"Prognosis
Morbidity rates reported from field cases vary from less than 1% to 1.4%. Case fatality rate in outbreaks can vary from 5-15% but can reach 30-40% in more severe epizootics." (http://www.horsedvm.com/disease/equine-japanese-encephalitis/) - Mod.TG]
