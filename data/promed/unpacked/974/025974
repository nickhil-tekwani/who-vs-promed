Since 1 Aug 2017, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (DPH) has identified 1094 cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since 1 Aug 2017, primarily among the homeless and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

DPH is working closely with the CDC and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 7 Jul 2018:
--------------
Total Outbreak: 1094
Hospitalizations: 628
Deaths: 8

[The cases in Kentucky continue to increase dramatically and have left Michigan, the 2nd highest state for hepatitis A cases, in the dust. Addressing the marginalized cohorts of humanity affected the most, including the homeless and substance abusers, by supplying adequate sanitation and living conditions as was done in the San Diego area is needed to deal with these outbreaks occurring in a so-called developed world country such as the USA. Spill-over into other portions of the population such as restaurant diners affected through infected food handlers will continue. It is not clear how many of this rapidly increasing total are in individuals outside the described cohorts.

The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) has confirmed the state's 1st death related to a multi-state outbreak of hepatitis A, a highly contagious disease of the liver. The outbreak has caused nearly 4000 illnesses in 10 states and resulted in multiple fatalities nationwide. No additional details about the patient will be released due to privacy laws.

Since November 2017, ISDH has confirmed 214 outbreak-related cases of hepatitis A. Indiana typically sees about 20 cases in a 12-month period.

"This heartbreaking loss of life illustrates how serious this outbreak is, and I urge Hoosiers to practice good handwashing and to get vaccinated, especially if they fall into a high-risk population," said Indiana State Health Commissioner Kris Box, MD, FACOG. "We are working with our local and federal health partners to slow the spread of hepatitis A in our state, but this disease is highly contagious and can spread rapidly, so prevention is critical."

Over the past several months, Indiana health officials have been working to educate the public, restaurants, jails, and groups that serve at-risk populations about the outbreak and ways to prevent the disease. ISDH has allocated more than $1 million in additional state and federal funds to supply adult vaccine to local health departments, which are working to immunize those who are at risk or who may have come in contact with the disease.

Hepatitis A is usually transmitted person-to-person through fecal-oral routes or by consuming contaminated food or water. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies those most at risk during this outbreak as people who use illicit drugs, the homeless, men who have sex with men, and those who are incarcerated. More than 70 percent of the individuals diagnosed with hepatitis A in Indiana have reported illicit drug use, while nearly 20 percent have reported being homeless.

Indiana law has required a hepatitis A vaccine for school admission since 2014, so most students preparing to enter 4th grade and younger have already been vaccinated. Hepatitis A vaccine is readily available from health-care providers and pharmacies as routine preventive care.

Anyone who is exhibiting symptoms of hepatitis A should contact a health-care provider immediately and refrain from preparing food for others. Symptoms can include fatigue, loss of appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice, which usually appear within 2 months of infection. Individuals can become ill 15-50 days after being exposed to the virus. A doctor can determine if someone has hepatitis A with a blood test.
