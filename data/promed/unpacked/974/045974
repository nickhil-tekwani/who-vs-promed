Abstract
---------
In February 2021, routine sentinel surveillance for influenza-like illness in Cambodia detected a human avian influenza A(H9N2) virus infection. Investigations identified no recent H9N2 virus infections in 43 close contacts. One chicken sample from the infected child's house was positive for H9N2 virus and genetically similar to the human virus.

[ProMED thanks Jurre Siegers for sharing the early release publication on human infection with avian influenza A/H9N2 virus in Cambodia.

The reported case is a 3-year-old boy with a history of exposure to domestic poultry who presented with influenza-like illness in February 2021 and was confirmed to be infected with influenza A/H9N2 virus.

H9N2 viruses circulate endemically in poultry from Cambodia, as they do in Bangladesh, Viet Nam, and China. Of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) detected in chickens in Cambodia in live bird markets (LBMs), 75% are H9N2. Whereas serosurveys indicate persons in Cambodia with poultry contact are exposed to H9N2, active human infections have not been detected.

The authors conclude that "endemic H9N2 and other AIVs in poultry remain a concern for zoonotic infection. An interdisciplinary One Health approach is warranted to curb continuing expansion and emergence. Early detection and control in animal populations, enhanced biosafety, candidate vaccines, and prompt antiviral treatment might mitigate the risks of reassortment and continued evolution that could result in H9N2 viruses with increased mammalian adaptation or human-to-human transmission potential." - Mod.UBA

The 1st known infection by influenza A(H9N2) occurred in 1966 among turkeys in Wisconsin. This virus is currently regarded as the most widespread avian influenza virus subtype in poultry worldwide. According to OIE's criteria, spelled out in the International Manual, H9N2 is an LPAI virus (low pathogenicity avian influenza - in poultry). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is notifiable to the OIE, defined as "an infection of poultry by any influenza A virus that has been determined as high pathogenicity in accordance with the Terrestrial Manual." All naturally occurring HPAI strains isolated to date have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype.

LPAI H9N2 is, thus, not OIE-notifiable.

In addition to poultry, this virus has also been identified in wild birds, domestic mammals, and, occasionally, in humans.

LPAI H9N2 causes considerable losses to the poultry industry. Since the early 1990s, vaccination against this virus has been used extensively in Asia and the Middle East using billions of inactivated vaccine doses. - Mod.AS
