Vultures do not deserve castigation as spreaders of anthrax
-----------------------------------------------------------
I refer to the 5 Nov 2010 item "Anthrax, wildlife - South Africa: (Kruger
Natl Park) 20101105.4011" implying, in paragraph 4, that vultures play a
major role in transmission of anthrax. This unfortunately has become a
platitude stated all too frequently, based purely on assumption and not on
scientific evidence. It is doing much damage to the concerted effort by the
many concerned ecologists desperately trying to save Old World vulture
species from extinction.

I extract the following from an article on this issue written by myself and
due in the next issue of the BirdLife Botswana newsletter:

Vultures, in demolishing the fresh carcass of an animal that has died of
anthrax, play a very important role in reducing the environmental
contamination left by the carcass. The more vultures at a carcass, the
faster the carcass is consumed, and the less is the chance of sporulation,
residual contamination, and also of spread of the organism by flies. Since
vultures rely on other vultures to detect carcasses, when their numbers
drop, so does their ability to find carcasses.

The vultures do, of course, get the infected blood and gore on their beaks
and feathers but they will go to nearby water to wash this off.
Unsporulated bacteria die off quickly in water (and within the vulture's
digestive system). So, although the water may derive some anthrax spore
contamination from bacteria that have started to sporulate, this will be
low. Bacteriological tests have proved how difficult it is to detect
anthrax spores in such bodies of water. By the time the birds are airborne
again, numbers of spores on their feet, beaks, feathers, and in their guts
is back to zero or very low and well below normal infectious doses of
animals, and constitute a close to zero risk of transmitting the disease.
Again there is scientific evidence to support this.

Vultures are in serious decline in Asia and Africa from numerous human-made
causes -- habitat destruction, deliberate and inadvertent poisoning,
capture for traditional medicines, drowning in reservoirs, power line
crashes, electrocution, and so on. In India this is believed responsible
for substantial increases in rats and of feral dog populations with
consequent rises in the numbers of rabies and distemper cases.

So, actually, as well as reducing residual contamination at the site of an
anthrax carcass and minimizing fly-borne transmission, vultures have a
significantly wider role in the overall health of the ecosystem. It should
not to be forgotten also that circling vultures have always been, and
continue to be, the best signal to farmers that deaths have occurred within
their boundaries, enabling prompt action as needed.

In summary, vultures are not deserving of the frequent castigation they get
as major spreaders of anthrax and, in that that leads to them being shot or
poisoned, it can be anticipated that the result will be increased, not
decreased, problems associated with anthrax and other diseases.

[While Peter has a valid point -- overemphasis these days in blaming
vultures -- they are not blame free. If they did not open any carcasses
there would be minimal sporulation because of decomposition and carcass
acidification. That is until the other scavenger species increased in
numbers and density to take advantage of the extra free meals. And they are
not tidy feeders.

Although vultures very rapidly remove all the soft tissues in a matter of a
few hours, their actions do result in ground contamination and the
remaining carcass is open to sporulation and blow fly activity
contaminating the nearby browse and forage. And if they have to fly a
distance to bathe, sporulation will be well started by the time they enter
the water. This was well described in the earlier Namibian and South
African anthrax literature when the vultures made use of cattle and the
newly installed game water troughs.

We need vultures just as we need dung beetles to tidy up the mess. In the
later stages of the 2001 anthrax epidemic on the Edwards Plateau in Texas,
so many animals had died (the game mortality was in the 60 to over 80 per
cent range) that the vultures had long given up eating them -- thus the
Texas and Cajun folk belief that vultures do not feed on anthrax carcasses.
The place stank. It was so bad that some ranchers left their homes and
moved into town. We need them but they are not cost free.

If there is blame to be cast, it is on lazy ranchers who do not vaccinate
their livestock and game ranchers who do not burn or burn dead anthrax
carcasses. I suspect that part of the reason for blaming vultures is to
distract attention away from farmer and rancher responsibilities. - Mod.MHJ
