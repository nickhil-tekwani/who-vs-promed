A sporadic case of cholera in Germany
-----------------------------------------------
In some countries, contaminated water and foods, especially seafood,
are common vehicles for transmission of _Vibrio cholerae_, as the
following case reported in Germanys surveillance bulletin last week
shows (1).
A 36 year old German resident of Nigerian origin became acutely ill on
12 Jul 2001 with watery diarrhoea and vomiting (1). He was admitted to
hospital in Berlin on 14 July with continuing symptoms, aggravated by
dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and acute kidney failure, but no
fever. The patient was given fluids and electrolytes, but no antibiotic
agents. He made a quick recovery, and his kidneys resumed their
function.
_V. cholerae_ (serotype O1, biotype Inaba, phenotype El Tor) was
isolated from a stool specimen taken on 17 July. No other
gastrointestinal pathogens were found. He was discharged from
hospital, free of symptoms, on 25 Jul 2001; no further _V. cholerae_
had been found.
The patient had returned from a holiday in Nigeria on 30 Jun 2001.
Four hours before the onset of symptoms he had eaten fish that had
been brought into the country on a plane from Nigeria by friends on
the preceding day. The patient had prepared the fish himself, boiled it
in water, and was the only person to eat it.
The incubation period for cholera is between a few hours and 3 days,
and on this basis it can be concluded that the patient acquired his
infection by eating the fish from Nigeria. As the cooking process would
have killed the causative agent, it may be assumed infection was
acquired during preparation or from kitchen equipment.
No further cases are known among the patients contacts in Berlin or
among his friends and family in Nigeria. The case was reported to the
European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO).

from cholera-endemic countries are normally factory prepared with
clean water & are safe to eat. - Mod.JW
