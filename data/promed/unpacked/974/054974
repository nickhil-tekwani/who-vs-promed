[1] Saudi Arabia -- WHO update
Date: 15 Jun 2013

The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has announced an additional 3 laboratory confirmed cases, including one death, with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The 1st patient is a 45 year old man with underlying medical conditions from Taif governorate. He became ill since the end of May 2013 and is in a critical condition. The 2nd patient is a 68 year old woman with underlying medical conditions from Taif governorate. She became ill on [6 Jun 2013] and is in critical condition. The 3rd was a patient of 46 years old from Wadi Al-Dawaser. He became ill on 29 May 2013, was admitted to a hospital on [8 Jun 2013], and has died.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 61 laboratory confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 34 deaths.

WHO has received reports of laboratory-confirmed cases originating in the following countries in the Middle East to date: Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). France, Germany, Italy, Tunisia and the United Kingdom also reported laboratory confirmed cases; they were either transferred there for care of the disease or returned from the Middle East and subsequently became ill. In France, Italy, Tunisia, and the UK, there has been limited local transmission among patients who had not been to the Middle East but had been in close contact with the laboratory confirmed or probable cases.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all member states to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. Specimens from patients' lower respiratory tracts should be obtained for diagnosis where possible. Clinicians are reminded that MERS-CoV infection should be considered even with atypical signs and symptoms, such as diarrhoea, in patients who are immunocompromised.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All member states are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[This update is related to the 3 newly reported cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (27): Saudi Arabia, RFI 20130614.1773220. Additional information is on the severity of the illness in the 2 cases from Taif Governorate, although the report on the MOH website did mention both cases were being treated in the ICU, suggestive of serious illness.

It does appear that severe illness seems to be associated with pre-existing disease, albeit the nature of these pre-existing diseases has not been fully described. It would be interesting to see the results of the epidemiologic investigations into these cases.

As mentioned in the earlier ProMED-mail post, Al-Taif is a city about 62 miles (100 km) to the southeast of Mecca in Mecca province. Wadi ad-Dawasir is a town in Riyadh Province, Saudi Arabia, in the Dawasir valley. Both locations can be found on the map at http://www.atozmapsdata.com/zoomify.asp?name=Country/Modern/Z_Saudi_Pol2 (with slightly different spellings). - Mod.MPP]

[2] Guidance for pilgrimage to Middle East
Date: 16 Jun 2013

http://www.theglobaldispatch.com/cdc-advises-pilgrims-to-hajj-and-umrah-on-how-to-protect-against-mers-coronavirus-and-other-injuries-and-illness-10214/


With the upcoming Muslim pilgrimages of Hajj and Umrah approaching fast and the infectious disease and injury risks that are associated with such mass gatherings, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers recommendations and advice to protect yourself during these religious events.

The larger of the 2 events, the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, which draws some 3 million pilgrims annually, including more than 11 000 Americans, will likely take place the 3rd week of October [13-18 Oct 2013].

In addition, there is the Umrah pilgrimage, which can occur at any time of the year, with typical peak times being the days before, during and after the Hajj and during the last 10 days of Ramadan [beginning 9 Jul 2013].

There are numerous infectious diseases that are linked to mass crowds like those seen in these pilgrimages; however, this year [2013], the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has attracted the most attention recently.

With latest reports of 46 laboratory confirmed cases and 28 deaths, Saudi Arabia dwarfs all other countries in cases of MERS-CoV.

CDC says pilgrims can help protect themselves from respiratory illnesses by washing their hands often; not touching their mouth, nose, or eyes; and avoiding contact with sick people. They should pay attention to their health when traveling in the Arabian Peninsula and seek medical care if they develop a fever and cough or shortness of breath within 14 days after returning from their trip.

Despite the MERS numbers being reported out of the kingdom, CDC does not recommend changing travel plans for Hajj or Umrah because of MERS.

MERS is not the only infectious disease concern when attending the Hajj or Umrah. Polio, meningococcal meningitis, hepatitis A and B, typhoid, foodborne illnesses, and the routine vaccine-preventable diseases are all known issues with these mass gatherings.

Saudi Arabia requires pilgrims to be vaccinated against meningococcal meningitis. Proof of polio vaccine is not required for American pilgrims; however, CDC recommends a booster.

US health officials recommend pilgrims be up-to-date on routine vaccinations, including the flu shot.

Ensuring good food preparation (cooked food and drinks from sealed containers only) is highly recommended, as is avoiding animals.

To prevent bodily injuries from tragedies like stampedes associated with mass gatherings, try to avoid the most densely congested areas and try to attend events during non-peak hours. In fact, the Saudi government have urged domestic and foreign pilgrims to postpone their Hajj plans for this year [2013] if possible due to ongoing expansion work at Makkah's Grand Mosque, in an unprecedented move aimed at preventing congestion and stampedes and ensuring safety of pilgrims, according to a Eurasia Review report [16 Jun 2016].

Lastly, CDC warns of the dangers of heat-related injuries associated with the scorching heat in Mecca. "Temperatures in Mecca can easily exceed 100 F [37.8 C] in the summer and early fall. Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are leading causes of illness in people undertaking Hajj or Umrah during these months," according to CDC.

Pilgrims should drink plenty of water (bottled), wear sunscreen, rest, and seek shade as much as possible. Pilgrims who are fasting for Ramadan and cannot drink water during daylight hours should be sure to rehydrate after dusk.

[The above newswire is a good presentation of sound recommendations for attending any mass gathering where risk of disease transmission is enhanced through the large population gatherings in relatively close quarters. MERS-CoV is not the only disease of concern in these settings. There are relatively firm recommendations from the Saudi MOH. Mandatory vaccinations include meningococcal vaccine for all attendees (Hajj and Umrah) and yellow fever vaccine for attendees from yellow fever endemic countries (see http://www.hajinformation.com/main/p3001.htm). The Saudi Ministry of Health is known for its excellence in health coverage of mass gatherings and spearheads a WHO reference Center of Excellence on Mass Gatherings. Information on the health coverage for the pilgrimages can be found at the Saudi MOH website http://www.hajinformation.com/main/u4.htm.

That being said, one of the major concerns surrounding the upcoming mass gathering is the possibility of importation of MERS-CoV into countries that are less equipped to both identify and treat cases of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI), and the possibility for more widespread transmission of the virus, both at the community level as well as within healthcare facilities. From the limited epidemiologic information available, it appears as though community-based transmission has been either relatively low, or has been undetectable through presently available means of laboratory confirmation. In contrast, it does appear as though there has been nosocomial transmission, although details on the route(s) of transmission within the healthcare environments have not been readily available. - Mod.MPP
