The main shortcoming [with] anti-rabies efforts in Bali has been the failure to put a stop to dog culling, which has been widespread, and undertaken both by [official agencies], and private citizens. Herd immunity against rabies simply cannot be established in the free-roaming dog population in a climate of ongoing culls. And in a place like Bali, where the free-roaming dog population numbers in the hundreds of thousands, there is no shortcut to the diligence required to achieve 70 percent anti-rabies vaccine [ARV] coverage. The 2nd shortcoming follows directly, and that is inadequate anti-rabies vaccination coverage of the local dog population, along with too little on-the-ground monitoring of vaccination campaigns and no verification of reporting.

A recent case in point of scattershot implementation was the killing of more than 10 dogs by [the local authorities] in a village in Tianyar in Karangasem district after a man was bitten by a rabid dog on 13 Mar 2014. The dog died on the day itself. Samples sent for analysis came back positive for rabies. The man began post-exposure shots. A trip to the area soon after the cull revealed that many of the surviving local dogs were not wearing yellow collars (a yellow collar is put on dogs at the time of ARV.)

Further, a man in the area died after he was attacked by his pig. Neither the pig nor the deceased was tested for rabies, as far as I have been able to determine.

The theoretical model for eradicating rabies in Bali is sound. The problem is precisely that the model in question has not been adequately implemented. As a result, human and animal rabies deaths continue.

Dogs have recently been found that are positive for rabies in both Tabanan and Karengasem regencies.

Head of the Horticulture Department in Tabanan Ni Ketut Warsiki confirmed on Sun 6 Apr 2014 that dogs from Sekartaji village had been tested for the disease and were confirmed positive for rabies. The tests were conducted after a stray dog had bitten a villager. The animal in question has since been destroyed.

Warsiki cautioned that if people owned a pet dog, then they should have the dog vaccinated and keep the animal at home. He warned, in light of recent events, that mass dog culling would probably take place shortly, and all stray dogs would be destroyed.

[Random culling only temporarily reduces the numbers of unvaccinated dogs while significantly upsetting the owners -- even strays have people who feed them and depend on these dogs to watch for them -- and scattering the dogs.

Many years ago, I was introduced to efficient rabies control and eradication by my PAHO colleague Eutemio Gonzales, the PAHO Regional Rabies Control officer. With his Brazilian counterparts, he would have them deploy teams of otherwise unemployed men to vaccinate dogs, going house to house and putting a coloured collar on each vaccinated dog. Come back a week later, and the neighbourhood kids would show and find you any and all dogs not wearing a collar and needing to be vaccinated. Because of the canine seasonal breeding pattern, it would be timed when the pups were old enough to be vaccinated but still with their mothers. Three annual vaccinations, and rabies would be gone, and thereafter only maintenance vaccination was needed. And, frankly, for any veterinary public health officer, this is not complicated and reflects a basic competence, similar to bovine mastitis control provided by any competent veterinary large animal clinician. It is not difficult.
