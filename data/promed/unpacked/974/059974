Italy and France have reported updated statistics on a potentially fatal complication of _E. coli_ infection. The complication, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), is a type of kidney failure that can result in lifelong, serious health problems and death.

Italian data are from the start of September 2020 to the end of August 2021 when 49 cases were recorded. There were 84 cases from September 2019 to August 2020. French figures cover 2020, when 167 cases were reported. In Italy, patients were from 11 different regions and only one was diagnosed with HUS after returning from abroad. Of all cases, 47 were in patients younger than 15 years old. The number of HUS cases reported from September to December 2020 almost halved to 10 from an average of 19 in the previous 10 years.

"It is plausible to assume that measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic, taken in autumn-winter of 2020, may have also significantly contributed to reducing HUS incidence in the pediatric population. Indeed, a sharp decline had previously been observed also for the 3-month period between March and May 2020," said Italian officials.

Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC)] infection was confirmed in 45 of the 49 recorded HUS cases with one-third from _E. coli_ O26. For 36 of the 45 positive cases, the serogroup was also identified, and in 29 of the HUS cases for which this information was available, one of the top-5 EHEC serogroups (O26, O157, O111, O145, O103) was detected, while in one case, co-infection with strains belonging to 2 serogroups (O145 and O177) was reported. EHEC O177 was diagnosed more frequently in the past 12 months with 2 cases, compared to an average of 3 in the previous 10 years. This increase could be attributed to use of more sensitive diagnostic methods, according to the report. EHEC O80 was detected only once despite accounting for an increasing number of cases in recent years.

In France, the number of infections stayed almost the same in 2020 at 167 compared to 168 in 2019, according to data published by Sante Publique [Public Health] France. French surveillance excludes cases occurring during or in the days following a trip outside the country and only covers children under the age of 15. More than two-thirds of children affected were younger than 3 years old. The median length of hospital stay for all cases was 8 days but ranged from 1 to 69 days. The highest regional incidence rates were in the west of the country in Brittany, Pays de la Loire and Normandy.

From 142 HUS cases with information, 51 were from _E. coli O26, 29 from O80, and only 2 from O157.

A total of 17 epidemiological investigations were carried out in 2020 including 2 suspected foodborne outbreaks of EHEC without clinical complications. Some grouped cases of HUS were linked to consumption of unpasteurized, raw milk cheese and another cluster might have been caused by swimming in a lake. Between 4 May 2020 and 22 Jun 2020, 7 HUS patients reported consuming the same type of cheese made from raw cow's milk. For 5 cases, EHEC O26:H11 was isolated. Traceability efforts led to a single manufacturer but couldn't identify a common batch of cheese eaten by the sick people.

The company had favorable test results on all batches of cheese identified in investigations, and an inspection confirmed the EHEC risk management procedures were compliant. Based on this and no new cases, there were no product recalls or withdrawals. Sante Publique France advice is that the consumption of raw milk and cheeses made from raw milk is not recommended for young children, pregnant women, immunocompromised people and the elderly. More manufacturers of raw milk cheeses are starting to put this guidance on the labels of their products.

[The following by Joseph et al is a good basic review on HUS:
Joseph A, Cointe A, Kurkdjian PM, et al. Shiga toxin-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome: a narrative review. Toxins. 2020; 12(2): 67; https://doi.org/10.3390/toxins12020067

Abstract
--------
"The severity of human infection by one of the many Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) is determined by a number of factors: the bacterial genome, the capacity of human societies to prevent foodborne epidemics, the medical condition of infected patients (in particular their hydration status, often compromised by severe diarrhea), and by our capacity to devise new therapeutic approaches, most specifically to combat the bacterial virulence factors, as opposed to our current strategies that essentially aim to palliate organ deficiencies. The last major outbreak in 2011 in Germany, which killed more than 50 people in Europe, was evidence that an effective treatment was still lacking. Herein, we review the current knowledge of STEC virulence, how societies organize the prevention of human disease, and how physicians treat (and, hopefully, will treat) its potentially fatal complications. In particular, we focus on STEC-induced hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS), where the intrusion of toxins inside endothelial cells results in massive cell death, activation of the coagulation within capillaries, and eventually organ failure."

Regarding EHEC O80, Soysal et al (1) brought forth more information regarding this hybrid EHEC which contains a rare variant of the intimin gene and genetic determinants related to a plasmid, found mostly in avian pathogenic _E. coli_ and _E. coli_ that causes human neonatal meningitis, which is associated with extraintestinal virulence. This group, led by Stephane Bonacorsi, originally reported this atypical organism in an adult associated with HUS with a relapse associated with bacteremia (2).

The 2016 study reported that 96% of the cases were associated with HUS, but the authors do point out that the surveillance system for EHEC is voluntary in France and PCR assays for Shiga toxin in stool are done only in cases involving diarrhea with HUS suspicion, so the denominator of total O80:H2 cases is not known. Likewise, whether this organism is zoonotic is also not clear, and the areas in France with this strain are not where most cases of _E. coli_ O157 are reported.

Regarding the use of antimicrobials and O80, the issue is relevant in these cases because some of them are associated with bacteremia, which requires antimicrobial therapy. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone were not associated with increasing Shiga toxin production, whereas ciprofloxacin was in this study. In the large _E. coli_ O104:H4 outbreak in northern Germany, therapy was also used especially in those cases where the colon was perforated. In those reports, the carbapenem antimicrobials also did not increase toxin production. Whether these effects are strain specific is not clear at this time so should not necessarily be generalized to all EHEC. Of note, the _E. coli_ O104:H4 strain was a genetic hybrid between EHEC and enteroaggregative _E. coli_ and was not thought to be a zoonosis.

Extraintestinal invasive strains of EHEC will indeed introduce another layer of concern about these infections.
