[1] Senegal: pandemic response
Date: Sun 6 Sep 2020 06:00 AM EDT

COVID-19 test results come back within 24 hours -- or even faster. Hotels have been transformed into quarantine units. Scientists are racing to develop a cutting-edge, low-cost ventilator.

This isn't the pandemic response in South Korea, New Zealand, or another country held up as a model of coronavirus containment success. It's Senegal, a West African country with a fragile healthcare system, a scarcity of hospital beds, and about 7 doctors for every 100 000 people. And yet Senegal, with a population of 16 million, has tackled COVID-19 aggressively and, so far, effectively. More than 6 months into the pandemic, the country has about 14 000 cases and 284 deaths.

"You see Senegal moving out on all fronts: following science, acting quickly, working the communication side of the equation, and then thinking about innovation," said Judd Devermont, director of the Africa program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan foreign policy think tank. Senegal deserves "to be in the pantheon of countries that have ... responded well to this crisis, even given its low resource base," Devermont said.

Senegal snagged the no. 2 slot in a recent analysis looking at how 36 countries have handled the pandemic [A figure showing the data is available at the source URL. - Mod.MPP]. The United States landed near the bottom: 31st of the 36 countries examined by Foreign Policy magazine, which included a mix of wealthy, middle income and developing nations. Senegal received strong marks for "a high degree of preparedness and a reliance on facts and science," while the US was dinged for poor public health messaging, limited testing, and other shortcomings.

Devermont and others say Senegal's quiet success is due to a combination of quick action, clear communication, and its experience during the 2014 Ebola outbreak. During that health crisis, Senegal confirmed its 1st case on [29 Aug 2014]; officials immediately identified 74 other people the patient had been in contact with and began monitoring and testing them. "Testing was prompt and reliable; all results were negative," the World Health Organization said in declaring the outbreak over just a few months later. "With outbreaks raging just across its borders, Senegal was well-prepared, with a detailed response plan in place as early as March [2020]."

When the novel coronavirus emerged, Dr Abdoulaye Bousso, director of Senegal's Health Emergency Operation Center, said the government began drawing up a contingency plan as soon as the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency on [30 Jan 2020]. When the country had its 1st positive case 2 months later, President Macky Sall immediately imposed a curfew and restricted travel between Senegal's 14 regions. The country ramped up testing capacity quickly, creating mobile labs that can return results within 24 hours, or as quickly as 2 hours in some cases, Bousso said.

Sall's government also made a dramatic promise: Every person who tested positive would have a treatment bed, whether they had symptoms or not. That kept patients away from home, where they might transmit the virus to family members. "We saw at the beginning that if you do that, we can very rapidly stop the transmission," Bousso said.

Another small but significant step: Every day, an official from the health ministry delivers a grim update, disclosing the number of new infections, how many people have been cured, and how many have died. "If we have 6 people who died, we say it. If we have one person, we say it," Bousso said. The aim is to be fully transparent, to keep people mobilized, and to counter any suggestion that the virus is not a serious threat, he explained.

SU, an immigration lawyer from Seattle who moved to Senegal with her family 2 years ago, said the government's response has been impressive, if not perfect. She said it's been "bizarre" to watch the US response from afar, adding that she would much rather be living in Dakar. "There hasn't been a moment where my family was thinking, 'Oh, we should have evacuated.' We always felt being here was the better choice," [she] said.

Her Senegalese friends are flabbergasted that Americans are arguing over whether to wear masks and that some are questioning the severity of the virus. "People here ask us, 'This isn't true, right?'" [she] said. "The way the society and the culture are here ... it's unimaginable that a person would reject wearing a mask to protect the people around them."

She and others have gotten used to the new norm in Senegal, which includes getting temperature checks and a squirt of hand sanitizer whenever they venture out for food or other necessities. At every grocery store, restaurant, and other facilities, "there's a security guard standing at the door with a thermal forehead thermometer and a bottle of sanitizer," she said. Everyone complies without a fuss, she said, working "together as a community ... to keep each other healthy."

Devermont said Senegal's success in tackling Ebola gave them a blueprint to respond to COVID "right out of the gate." And he noted that Sall enjoys high confidence across Senegal, ensuring that people take his warnings and the government restrictions seriously. He noted that Sall has also led by example, deciding to self-isolate after being exposed to the virus, even though he tested negative.

"Senegal is not out of the woods," Devermont said, noting there may be gaps in testing and other uncertainties about how the virus will progress there. But so far, the country has shown that it doesn't take a world-class health system and gobs of money to keep the virus in check.

"Your level of preparedness is incredibly important, and the resource base that you have is important," Devermont said. "But leadership trumps all of that. ... And I think Macky Sall and his government have shown extraordinary leadership."

Bousso agreed Senegal cannot say yet that it has the virus under control. "But we are optimistic that if we continue on our way, we can stop this outbreak in the country," he added.

[It is nice to read upbeat reports like this. There is also a Pasteur Institute laboratory in Dakar that has helped through the years to develop a good laboratory network in Senegal. But most uplifting is the political response to the pandemic, taking it seriously and setting an example following recommended public health guidelines.

The 7 Sep 2020 update from the Ministry of Health: Communique 190, available at http://www.sante.gouv.sn/sites/default/files/COMMUNIQU%C3%89%20190_COVID19.pdf (in French, trans. Mod.MPP):
"On Mon 7 Sep 2020, the Ministry of Health and Social Action has received the following vial test results:
Of 1052 tests conducted, 27 were positive, giving a positivity rate of 2.5%. The positive cases were distributed as follows:
- 17 contacts of known cases
- 10 cases related to community transmission: Dakar Plateau (3), Grand-Dakar (1), Kedougou (1), Liberte-6 (1), Maristes (1), Mbao (1), Richard Toll (1), and Thies (1).
- 115 hospitalized patients under observation are negative and declared cured.
- 36 serious cases are in the ICU.
- 1 death was reported on Sun 6 Sep 2020.
- The status of other hospitalized patients is stable.

As of today (7 Sep 2020), 14 014 cases were confirmed as positive of which 10 037 were cured, 2219 died, and 3685 are currently under treatment.

The Ministry of Health and Social Action strongly encourages people to strictly respect preventive messages both collectively as well as individually."

Like other countries in similar circumstances, Senegal is concerned the outbreak can surge unexpectedly.

A map of Senegal showing administrative divisions and cities can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/senegal-administrative-map.htm. Cases are located in the Dakar region, Kedougou (in Tambacounda, southeastern Senegal near the border with Guinea), Liberte-6 (Dakar region), Maristes (Dakar), Mbao (in Cape Vert near Dakar), Richard Toll (in Saint-Louis, northern Senegal on the Senegal river bordering with Mauritania), and Thies (just east of Dakar). - Mod.MPP]

ref: Dearlove B, Lewitus E, Bai H, et al. A SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate would likely match all currently circulating variants [published online ahead of print, 2020 Aug 31]. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2020; 202008281. doi:10.1073/pnas.2008281117
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Significance
------------
The rapid spread of the virus causing COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, raises questions about the possibility of a universally effective vaccine. The virus can mutate in a given individual, and these variants can be propagated across populations and time. To understand this process, we analyze 18 514 SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled since December 2019. We find that neutral evolution, rather than adaptive selection, can explain the rare mutations seen across SARS-CoV-2 genomes. In the immunogenic Spike protein, the D614G mutation has become consensus, yet there is no evidence of mutations affecting binding to the ACE2 receptor. Our results suggest that, to date, the limited diversity seen in SARS-CoV-2 should not preclude a single vaccine from providing global protection.

Abstract
--------
The magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the urgency for a safe and effective vaccine. Many vaccine candidates focus on the Spike protein, as it is targeted by neutralizing antibodies and plays a key role in viral entry. Here we investigate the diversity seen in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) sequences and compare it to the sequence on which most vaccine candidates are based. Using 18 514 sequences, we perform phylogenetic, population genetics, and structural bioinformatics analyses. We find limited diversity across SARS-CoV-2 genomes: Only 11 sites show polymorphisms in more than 5% of sequences; yet 2 mutations, including the D614G mutation in Spike, have already become consensus. Because SARS-CoV-2 is being transmitted more rapidly than it evolves, the viral population is becoming more homogeneous, with a median of 7 nucleotide substitutions between genomes. There is evidence of purifying selection but little evidence of diversifying selection, with substitution rates comparable across structural versus nonstructural genes. Finally, the Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence for the Spike protein, which is the basis for different vaccine candidates, matches optimized vaccine inserts, being identical to an ancestral sequence and one mutation away from the consensus. While the rapid spread of the D614G mutation warrants further study, our results indicate that drift and bottleneck events can explain the minimal diversity found among SARS-CoV-2 sequences. These findings suggest that a single vaccine candidate should be efficacious against currently circulating lineages.

[The estimate of the evolutionary rate for SARS-CoV-2, approximately 1x10^-3 is in the range for other RNA viruses (1x10^-3 to 1x10^-5 substitutions per nucleotide per year). It is reassuring to read these investigators found no evidence of mutations affecting binding to the ACE2 receptor since this is the target of many therapeutics and vaccines, that is, to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection through blocking the binding of viral particles to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. It will be important to monitor new mutations that may compromise the potential efficacy of vaccine candidates as well as interfere with the efficacy of diagnostic assays depending on specificity for the genomic RNA. - Mod.LK]

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 6 Sep 2020.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Cumulatively, nearly 27 million COVID-19 cases and 900 000 deaths have been reported to WHO to date. Over 1.8 million new cases and 37 000 new deaths were reported for the week ending [6 Sep 2020], a 5% increase in the number of cases and a 2% decrease in the number of deaths compared to the previous week ([24 to 30 Aug 2020]) (Figure 1 - Number of COVID-19 cases reported weekly by WHO region, and total deaths, [30 Dec 2019] to [6 Sep 2020]).

The WHO South-East Asia Region continued to show the highest increase in new COVID-19 cases in the past week, compared to the previous week, with over 600 000 new cases reported. A weekly increase in the number of new reported cases was seen in the European and Eastern Mediterranean Regions, while the African and Western Pacific Regions declined in both cases and deaths compared with last week. The Region of the Americas has seen a 1% increase in reported cases, but a 4% decrease in deaths, and continues to carry the highest burden of the disease globally, accounting for nearly half of all new cases reported in the past 7 days.

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
While cases in South Africa have declined this week, the country continues to report the highest number of cases in the region, accounting for 37% of all new cases. Other countries reporting a high number of cases include Ethiopia, Algeria, Namibia, and Kenya. While cases in Nigeria have declined by 35% this week, compared to the previous week, the number of reported deaths increased by 200%.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, data as of [6 Sep 2020].

- Region of the Americas
The United States of America and Brazil account for nearly 3/4ths of all COVID-19 cases in the Americas. Argentina, Colombia, and Peru account for the next largest proportion in new cases in the region. In the Bahamas, public health and social measures have been extended from mid-August [2020] as the island continues to experience an increase in cases (18%) and deaths (15%).

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by Region of the Americas, data as of [6 Sep 2020].

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The highest numbers of new cases in the region have been seen in Iraq, Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and Iraq continues to report the highest number of new COVID-19 cases. In Afghanistan, cases have increased by 77% this week compared to last week, although new deaths are down by 33% as compared to last week. In Bahrain, cases have increased by nearly 44% in the past 7 days as have cases in Tunisia where trends show an increase in cases since the country reopened its borders at the end of June [2020].

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by Eastern Mediterranean Region, data as of [6 Sep 2020].

- European Region
In the European Region, France reported the highest number of new cases in the past 7 days, with nearly 44 000 cases, followed closely by Spain at just over 40 000. Russia and Ukraine also continue to report a high number of cases. In Ukraine, cases are continuing to rise, with a 19% increase in the past 7 days. The government has extended the public health and social measures until the end of October [2020]. While cases in Italy have continued to show an increase, this week's 9% increase was substantially lower than last week's nearly 85% increase.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by European Region, data as of [6 Sep 2020]

- South East Asia Region
India continues to report a very high number of new cases, reaching nearly 600 000 new cases in the past 7 days, with an average of approximately 81 582 cases per day, the highest numbers of daily new cases in the past week. In Myanmar, cases have shown a marked increase of nearly 87% in the past 7 days.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by South-East Asia Region, data as of [6 Sep 2020].

- Western Pacific Region
The 3 countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the Western Pacific Region are the Philippines, Japan and Republic of Korea. However, the Philippines have seen a decrease in new cases in the past week compared to the previous week. French Polynesia has seen an increase of just over 29% in cases in the past 7 days; while stricter containment rules were imposed last month [August 2020], both the government and the French High Commission ruled out more stringent public health and social measures, with schools set to reopen on [7 Sep 2020].

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. The same note of caution interpreting today's [7 Sep 2020] as yesterday's [6 Sep 2020]. These data represent the data reported to WHO up though 4:24 PM on Mon 7 Sep 2020. During the weekends, there are countries that do not report to WHO, and there are administrative divisions within countries that do not report to their government on the weekend. Hence, most regional newly confirmed cases and reported deaths are decreased over the weekend. This occurs often on Mondays as well, as most of the data reported on Mondays was collected on Sundays.

Data by country, area, or territory for 7 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept7_1599519638.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 43.8% of daily case numbers and 57.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 14.1 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 11.1% of daily case numbers and 5.6% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.5 million. Countries not reporting to WHO today [7 Sep 2020] include Spain, Kazakhstan, Belgium, and Sweden. The dominant country is France, followed by Russia, the UK, Ukraine, Turkey, Israel, and Italy.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.4% of daily case numbers and 7.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Morocco, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 3.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Cote d'Ivoire, Algeria, and the Republic of the Congo.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.3% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.52 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 36.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 23.7% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.7 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India. Noteworthy is that the Italian MOH data today [7 Sep 2020] on mortality shows an increase of 66.7% in comparing 7-day averages.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 7 Sep 2020 is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (75 022), followed by the USA (25 325) and Brazil (10 188) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.3%) and 56.2% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 9293 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (6-7 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Argentina (9215), Spain (8416), Colombia (5327), and Russia (5185), and 27 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 5 of the top 10 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region and 8 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 1.5%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.4%.

Impression: The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region remains the Americas, even with the weekend reporting artifacts. - Mod.MPP]
