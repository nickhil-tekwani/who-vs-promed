An outbreak of bovine anthrax is suspected in a herd in the
municipality of Vitanje. The Veterinary Practitioner visiting the farm
on Monday evening [5 Sep 2011} reported his suspicion of anthrax. The
Veterinary Administration has already initiated preventive measures
following their on-farm investigation. The results of the
investigations are expected by the end of the week of 6-9 Sep 2011.

[This is an interesting incident because this disease is truly very
sporadic in Slovenia. The last Slovenian outbreaks (2) were in October
2008, near Celje, which is just south of Vitanje. The previous
outbreak (singular) was in 2001, and before that there was an outbreak
in 1992. The awareness of the Svlovenian veterinarians is to be
commended, even if the initial diagnosis is not confirmed in this
instance. To find Vitanje go to:

We had 2 postings in 2008 for the Celje outbreaks -- see below -- and
it was also reported by OIE:

This report includes a map showing the location of Celje. - Mod.MHJ]
