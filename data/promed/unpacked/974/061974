Meningococcal disease rates have been declining in Florida with more than 150 cases reported annually 25 years ago to 27 cases reported in 2021, as vaccination rates have increased. Rates of disease have been stable over the last 5 years with an average of about 21 cases occurring annually.

In a follow-up on the meningococcal disease situation in Florida this year through 11 Sep 2022, 52 meningococcal disease cases have been reported in 17 counties (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/cdc-is-recommending-men-who-have-sex-with-men-get-a-meningococcal-vaccine-if-they-live-in-or-are-traveling-to-florida-38709/). Orange and Miami-Dade counties have reported the most with 14 and 7 cases, respectively.

[See source URL for figure of Florida meningococcal disease cases by county, 1 Jan to 11 Sep 2022.]

In 2022, 84% of reported cases were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. In 2022, the meningococcal disease rate was highest among those aged 19-34 years at 0.61 cases per 100 000 population. In 2022, among reported cases, 98% of reported cases were seen in the emergency department and 92% of reported cases were hospitalized. Additionally, 12 deaths were identified as being associated to meningococcal disease.

The best protection against meningococcal disease is keeping up to date with recommended vaccines. There are currently 2 types of meningococcal vaccines available in the United States: Meningococcal conjugate or MenACWY vaccines and Serogroup B meningococcal or MenB vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Protection (CDC) recommends meningococcal disease vaccination for all preteens and teens as well as other children and adults who are at increased risk of meningococcal disease.

Meningococcal disease can often be severe, leading to inpatient hospitalization and sometimes death. According to the CDC, about 10 to 15 in 100 people with meningococcal disease will die. Up to 1 in 5 survivors will have long-term disabilities which may include loss of limb(s), deafness, nervous system problems, and brain damage.

[Since 2001, clusters of invasive meningococcal disease (meningitis and bloodstream infection, i.e., meningococcemia) among men who have sex with men (MSM) have been reported in cities in North America, Europe, and Australia, associated with a high case fatality rate. All cases were caused by hypervirulent serogroup C strains of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (MenC) belonging to the sequence type (ST) 11 (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0160126).

The outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease in MSM have occurred in Toronto (2001), Chicago (2003), New York (2010-13), Paris (2014), Berlin (2012-13), southern California (2012-16), and Victoria, Australia (2017). Currently, there is a large ongoing MenC outbreak among MSM in the US state of Florida, which is mostly affecting people who live in Florida, but also involves non-residents who have traveled to Florida (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html#serogroup-c-outbreak).

When ProMED last reported on the Florida outbreak (24 Jul 2022), 12 people died among 48 cases of meningococcal disease (case fatality rate 25%) reported in Florida in 2022, which is primarily affecting MSM (ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - USA (07): (FL) fatal, sg C, MSM, Hisp., HIV-pos, vacc 20220724.8704633). As of 11 Sep 2022, there are now 52 meningococcal disease cases, with 12 deaths, in 17 Florida counties. Orange (Orlando) and Miami-Dade (Miami) counties have reported the most, with 14 and 7 cases, respectively. However, no mention is made in the news report above or from the Florida health department if the 4 additional cases were caused by MenC or occurred in MSM (https://www.floridahealth.gov/Diseases-and-Conditions/vaccine-preventable-disease/_documents/2022-august-vpd-surveillance.pdf).

Increased international travel to attend large gatherings, in crowded venues, in the context of Gay Pride and other festivals may be factors facilitating the spread of the MenC invasive meningococcal disease among MSM, as it has monkeypox. Vaccination campaigns using a conjugate meningococcal C vaccine, such as MenACWY, in MSM with one dose (or a 2-dose series for people with HIV), at least 2 weeks before traveling, have been encouraged by the US CDC and European health authorities (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/outbreaks/FL2022.html and https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/downloads/17-275138C1-MeningococcalDis-ACWY-Outbreak-FS.pdf).

Although _N. meningitidis_ normally colonize the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, members of the meningococcal ST 11 clade have also genetically adapted to the urogenital tract, facilitating transmission via oro-genital sexual contact to cause outbreaks of meningococcal urethritis presenting at sexually transmitted infection clinics in multiple US cities in recent years (Ohio, California, Michigan, Indiana, Georgia, and other states) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6521a5.htm and https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-018-4560-x). _N. meningitidis_ isolates from MSM with invasive meningococcal disease in Germany have been found to be genetically similar to _N. meningitidis_ strains from urethritis in MSM, suggesting that sexual transmission may be playing a role in the emergence of MenC disease among MSM (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4972413/).

Gram-stained smears of urethral discharge appear identical in gonococcal and meningococcal urethritis. Meningococcal urethritis in this circumstance should be suspected if the gonococcal NAAT of the urethral discharge is negative (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7004a1.htm). Meningococcal urethritis is treated with the same antimicrobial regimens as gonococcal urethritis.

Although evidence is limited regarding the risk for sexual transmission or recurrent infections with meningococcal urethritis, treatment of sex partners of patients with meningococcal urethritis with the same antimicrobial regimens as for exposure to gonococcal infection can be considered (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/rr/rr7004a1.htm). - Mod.ML
