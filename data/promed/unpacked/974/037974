A Strain of Multidrug-Resistant _Salmonella_ Newport in Mexico
--------------------------------------------------------------
Warning - Level 3, Avoid Nonessential Travel
Alert - Level 2, Practice Enhanced Precautions

Key points
----------
- Some travelers who have spent time in Mexico have been infected with multidrug-resistant (MDR) _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Newport.
- MDR _Salmonella_ has developed the ability to defeat drugs designed to kill them. Infections with MDR _Salmonella_ can be difficult to treat.
Clinicians should follow CDC's treatment guidance.
- Many travelers with MDR _Salmonella_ Newport infections reported eating beef, cheese (including queso fresco and Oaxaca), beef jerky, or dried beef (carne seca) before they got sick.

What can travelers do to prevent _Salmonella_ infection?
--------------------------------------------------------
- Follow safe eating, drinking, cooking, and food handling habits to help reduce your chance of getting sick while traveling. Find out which foods and drinks are usually safe for travelers.
- Be aware that beef jerky and other dried beef products can cause illness if not prepared safely. If you don't know whether beef jerky was prepared safely, consider not eating it.
- Handle and cook beef safely when preparing it at home.
- Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before eating, before and after touching food, and after using the toilet.
- Travelers who feel very ill or have severe symptoms should seek medical care immediately.

DO NOT:
- Eat beef that may be raw or undercooked.
- Eat soft cheese that might be made from raw or unpasteurized milk.
- Eat food prepared by someone who is sick or has recently been sick.
- Prepare food for others while you are sick.

[Many cases of salmonellosis are self-limited and do not require specific antimicrobial therapy. If treatment is required, CDC suggests:
https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/general/technical/newport.html

- Consider the resistance profile of this strain of MDR _Salmonella_ Newport when selecting empiric treatment for patients who traveled to Mexico in the 7 days before the illness began.
- Ceftriaxone or an alternative agent should be considered for empiric treatment.
- Most isolates are susceptible to ceftriaxone.
- Most isolates are resistant to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
- Azithromycin may not be effective for treating this strain and should be used with caution. Clinical breakpoints to determine resistance have not been established for azithromycin, but most isolates carry a macrolide resistance gene and show an elevated minimum inhibitory concentration (>32 Âµg/mL) on laboratory testing.
