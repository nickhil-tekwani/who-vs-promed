False-Positive Laboratory Tests for Cryptosporidium Involving an
Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay  United States, November 1997March 1998.
>From November 1997 through March 1998, the number of positive tests for
Cryptosporidium increased in several locations in the United States.
Several laboratories (e.g., the New York state laboratory and the Medical
Science Laboratories in Wisconsin) retested original stool specimens and
could not confirm the original positive test result. Following reports to
the manufacturer by the Massachusetts, New York, and Wisconsin state health
departments about possibly inaccurate test results, Alexon-Trend* (Ramsey,
Minnesota) notified its laboratory customers in a March 25, 1998, letter
that three lots of its enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 24 well
(catalog number 540-24) ProSpecT Cryptosporidium Microplate Assay (lot
numbers 970717, 975011, and 980401) and seven lots of its ELISA 96 well
(catalog number 540- 96) ProSpecT Cryptosporidium Microplate Assay (lot
numbers 970696, 970775, 970883, 975006, 980402, 980808, and 980809) were
subject to a "non-specific reaction between some stool specimens and the
microplate assay" (i.e., a false-positive test result) (K. Hood,
Alexon-Trend, personal communication, March 25, 1998). Alexon-Trend
directed laboratories to discontinue using kits with implicated lot
numbers. This report summarizes an analysis of reports of false-positive
tests and describes identification of apparent clusters in three states.
**********
[MMWR] Editorial Note: ELISA and other immunoassays offer advantages over
diagnostic tests based on microscopic methods, especially for laboratories
that perform large numbers of tests. ELISA can be used to test multiple
stool specimens simultaneously, and ELISA does not require the same high
level of technical skill needed to identify parasites based on the
morphologic and staining characteristics observed during microscopic
examination. However, when a laboratory depends solely on ELISA for
detection of Cryptosporidium, false-positive test results may go
unrecognized for long periods of time because of problems associated with
the kit reagents or technician error.
Retaining stool specimens, or preparing a permanent microscopic slide
whenever an ELISA result is positive has implications for cost, staffing,
and storage. In laboratories that rely solely on antigen tests of stool
specimens for parasites and that do not routinely retain stool specimens or
make permanent slides, management should consider monitoring the rate of
positive test results and, when this rate noticeably increases above a
certain level (e.g., two or more times the laboratory's mean positivity
rate for an organism), implement confirmatory testing by microscopic
methods and/or begin archiving stool specimens.
Alternatively, all stool specimens could be split before testing so that an
aliquot of a specimen positive by ELISA could be sent to a reference
diagnostic laboratory for confirmation. This method is analogous to using
ELISA as a screening test for human immunodeficiency virus, with Western
blot testing used to confirm specimens positive by ELISA. Another advantage
of retaining stool specimens is its availability for polymerase chain
reaction-based genotyping, as might be warranted in an outbreak. In New
York, laboratories using ELISA must either prepare a permanent microscopic
slide or retain a portion of the original stool specimen, and laboratories
are required to hold slides or stool specimens for 1 year. As a result of
the investigation described in this report, New York state has reminded
laboratories of this existing requirement and has used this incident in a
statewide educational workshop for laboratorians.
In many communities, a cluster of laboratory-reported cases of
cryptosporidiosis elicits a multidisciplinary investigation to find the
cause. Every community should develop a plan for responding quickly and
efficiently to increases in the number of reported cases of
cryptosporidiosis. Essential components of an effective response plan
include confirming the diagnosis, comparing current disease data with
baseline data, and developing a strategy for critically and systematically
determining whether there is a community outbreak. Having access to good
laboratory records and stored specimens facilitates confirmation of the
diagnosis and reduces the likelihood that limited health department
resources will be redirected to an unnecessary community-wide epidemiologic
investigation on the basis of false-positive laboratory results.
When evidence suggests a commercial laboratory diagnostic kit is yielding
inaccurate test results, this information should be forwarded to the kit
manufacturer and the appropriate local and state health department. These
departments will inform the state certifying authority for laboratory
practice, the Food and Drug Administration, and CDC.
