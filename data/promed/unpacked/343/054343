[Newcastle disease is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) serotype of the genus _Avulavirus_ belonging to the subfamily _Paramyxovirinae_, family _Paramyxoviridae_.

Though the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) has not yet been determined, given the high morbidity (66 per cent), mortality (53 per cent) and case fatality (80 per cent) rates, it is likely to be a virulent strain [see report above].

"Morbidity and mortality rates vary greatly depending on the virulence of the strain and susceptibility of the host. Lentogenic and mesogenic viruses usually kill few birds; in poultry, the mortality rate is approximately 10 per cent for mesogenic strains and negligible with lentogenic strains. Concurrent illnesses may increase the severity of illness and result in a higher death rate. In contrast, velogenic isolates have morbidity and mortality rates up to 100 per cent in unvaccinated chickens. The onset of disease is usually rapid, and the virus often spreads quickly, particularly in group-housed flocks. Some isolates can affect young birds more severely. Vaccinated poultry tend to have milder infections. In one epidemic mainly affecting vaccinated chickens, flock mortality rates were 30 per cent to 90 per cent" (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/newcastle_disease.pdf).

According to Romania's last 6-monthly OIE Report (January-June 2014), vaccination is not prohibited; however, they do not indicate using vaccine as a routine control measure.
