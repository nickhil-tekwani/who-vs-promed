The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries (VDGIF) has
increased its testing of the state's largemouth bass (LMB) population
to see whether more of the popular gamefish has a killer virus. A
small number of bass have tested positive, but so far the biologists
say it is nothing to become alarmed about.
Every southeastern state is checking for the Largemouth Bass Virus
(LMBV), and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Fish Health Unit in
Lamar, Pennsylvania., is doing all the testing. Virginia's neighbors,
Tennessee and North Carolina, had bass test positive for the virus,
and Virginia wasted little time getting into the fray since some of
its freshwater impoundments are shared with the 2 states.
A spokesman for the VDGIF says, "The virus in Virginia appears to
have a very low prevalence of disease, in most cases only 1 fish in
60 was a carrier. Although the presence of this virus may appear
troubling, its occurrence does not mean fish in the state are
diseased, nor does it imply they will ever show signs of illness. No
fish kills involving only largemouth bass have been reported in the
Commonwealth, which indicates LMBV is not an epidemic problem."
The virus first gained notoriety in 1995 in South Carolina's huge
Santee-Cooper reservoir, where LMBV was isolated in fish associated
with a then-inexplicable bass die-off. Since then the bass virus has
been found in 17 states. It seems to show up during extreme periods
of heat and frequently affects only the biggest bass. On the
good-news side, no long-term impacts have been documented as a result
of fish die-offs caused by LMBV.
The virus is a type believed to have been introduced by the tropical
fish industry, Virginia fish and game officials say. It presents no
threat to humans or warm-blooded animals. Diseased fish near death
appear to be unable to swim upright and will often appear on the
water's surface.
The VDGIF also asks the fishing public not to release unused bait
into the water or transfer fish from one body of water to another,
and it wants the public to drain and clean their boats' live wells
and bilge pumps between fishing trips.

[This disease seems to be spreading across the Southern US and now up
the Eastern States. It is a serious disease profoundly affecting the
bass population and the sport fishing industry in affected states.
There is not enough research to know whether this virus poses dangers
other than dead fish and diminished industry. - Mod.TG]
