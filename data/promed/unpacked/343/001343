The 1st cases of infectious salmon anemia in 4 years have been recorded in fish farms in New Brunswick.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency identified 4 cases of infection in the Bay of Fundy [between the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia] since March 2016. The most recent dates back to [20 Sep 2016].

According to the provincial Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture, a single infected fish was found in all cases.

Susan Farquharson, of the Association of Atlantic Canadian farmers, says "4 cages have been emptied and there has been no further incidents."

Ms Farquharson says it is very possible that the infection will not be transmitted to other fish in the sea cages, despite the proximity of fish. "It's quite possible, she said, thanks to our strong system of early detection [...] We do not take the health of fish lightly and we empty the cages immediately [when an infection is detected]."

Infectious salmon anemia poses no risk to people who eat infected fish, but can decimate salmon farms. The mortality rate of fish that are affected is around 90 percent according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

A spokesman for the provincial Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture says that in the recent cases, there was no unusually high mortality rate on fish farms.
