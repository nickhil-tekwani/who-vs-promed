A case of trichinosis in La Union community, Los Rios
--------------------------------------------------------------
Authorities urged the population not to eat meat of dubious origin.

This information was revealed by Dr. Daniel Segura, Head of the Public
Health Department in Los Rios Region SEREMI, who also pointed out that
after the occurrence of a suspicious case of trichinosis in Chan-Chan,
near Puerto Nuevo, La Union community, the Chilean Public Health
Institute confirmed - by means of specialized tests - the occurrence
of the disease, which was caused because of eating pork from the
aforementioned rural area.

According to the health care officer, while the case remained as
suspicious, the patient remained hospitalized, where the appropriate
therapy was instituted, and now the patient has been discharged and he
is in his house, in a good condition.

Dr. Segura also emphasized the recommendations with respect to use
meat - and pork - from well-recognized sources, and in case these
foods are from animals locally slaughtered, they must be analyzed by a
veterinary in order to rule out the presence of the parasite by means
of a test called trichinoscopy, so that any health risk may be
avoided.

It is also worth mentioning that in case a person may catch the
disease, common symptoms are vomiting, fever, diarrhea and muscle
spasm. Sometimes the condition may become more severe and even lead to
death. For this reason, affected persons must immediately be taken to
a health care facility in order to get timely medical care.

[A review of trichinellosis in South America including Chile found
that "Most of the outbreaks of human trichinellosis in Mexico,
Argentina and Chile have occurred as a result of the consumption of
undercooked pork or pork products from animals raised under poor
hygienic conditions and which are clandestinely slaughtered"
(Ortega-Pierres MG et al. Epidemiology of trichinellosis in Mexico,
Central and South America. Vet Parasitol. 2000;93:201-25).
