Pandemic Warning
---------------------
The head of the UN Animal Health, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
warned [foot and mouth disease (FMD) had grown into a global crisis.
"We have different types of virus and one of them particularly -- type O
[the type discovered in the Essex outbreak -- is spreading and we can
really call it a pandemic," said Yves Cheneau.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today program, Mr. Cheneau warned type O would
follow "not only the movement of animals but also the movement of foods, by
tourists, by immigrants and so on, and can constitute a real danger." He
added: "History shows type O started in 1991 in south Asia and spread
through the Arabian Peninsula and reached Europe for the first time in 1996."
As efforts continued to trace the source of the disease, Kevin Pearce,
spokesman for the National Farmers' Union, said vigilance and not panic
would keep the outbreak under control. "We would expect within about 7 days
we would be in a good position to know whether or not this is likely to
spread and whether we are going to see any further cases."

A fifth outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) was confirmed on a farm in
Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, which had supplied cull
sows to the Essex abattoir. This is suspected as the source of the abattoir
infection, and is believed to have been infected for some time.
The fourth outbreak of FMD was confirmed at the village of Canewdon, Essex,
6 miles from the Essex abattoir, outside the initial restriction zone. The
situation is seen as very serious. Minister for Agriculture, Nick Brown
will make a statement later this afternoon. [Reference the above post

The alarming situation and fears of foot and mouth disease (FMD) spreading
in Britain has turned the countryside into a "no go" country. Hunting,
hiking and other activities have been curtailed or asked to be curtailed in
an effort to suspend the outbreak. All of Britain fears a repeat of the
1967 nightmare outbreak of FMD where more than 440 000 animals were
slaughtered after over 2300 cases were discovered
Hunting has been suspended across Britain because of the FMD outbreak. The
Countryside Alliance says the suspension will last for 7 days. The move
follows Britain's first major outbreak of the disease for 20 years.
Britain's countryside has been placed on red alert with both city and rural
dwellers told to keep away from farmland. The Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) said all non-essential visits to farms with
livestock should be avoided.
"I would like to appeal to the public, particularly in the infected areas,
to minimize the risks of spread. For the public this involves reducing
contact with livestock and farms," Agriculture Secretary Nick Brown said.
The government, fearful that the disease could ruin Britain's farming
industry, is painfully aware FMD knows no boundaries and can spread easily
-- even through the air.
Postmen were among those urged to leave all deliveries at farm gates in a
bid to eliminate the risk of tramping any disease from farm to farm.
Ramblers [hikers were also asked to think about cancelling any plans for
countryside treks taking in farmland where animals were present.
Although the presence of FMD has so far only been confirmed at the Essex
abattoir where it was discovered on Monday, there are real fears it may
have spread. Officials have confirmed the animal movement exclusion zone
surrounding the Cheale Meats abattoir and farm complex, in Little Warley,
Essex, had been doubled to 10 miles.
At European Union headquarters in Brussels, experts fear the disease is so
contagious it may yet spark an outbreak on the Continent, a nightmare
scenario. In the event it happens, it could bring Europe's meat trade to
its knees.
It is not only exported livestock threatening Britain's neighbors; the
virus could also be carried by the wind, on the soles of tourists' shoes or
on the wheels of cars, [EU experts said. "This would be an absolute
disaster for the meat business, much worse than mad cow disease," said
Jean-Luc Meriaux of the EU's meat trading association UECBV.
The European Commission, meanwhile, warned it would have no hesitation in
extending the ban on Britain's 8 million-pound-a-week exports of live
animals, meat and dairy products beyond the current March 1 deadline if the
disease had not been totally eradicated.
Officials said they were chasing all possible leads for the source of the
outbreak, including the "surprisingly large" number of pet pig owners in
the affected region in southeast England.

[FMD affects cattle, pigs, and deer but has little effect on human beings.
The rare case of FMD in humans is similar to a mild cold. This disease is
potentially devastating for Britain. They have experienced and endured mad
cow disease, or BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) as well as a recent
outbreak of Classical Swine Fever (CSF) ­ Mod.TG
