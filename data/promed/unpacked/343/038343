Since Feb 2017, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been confirmed in 8 local government areas (LGAs) of Borno, with transmission still ongoing in Rann Kala Balge. The total number of jaundice cases reported is 1262. A total of 226 specimens were collected in 10 LGAs, of these 182 tested positive using IgM HEV antibody ELISA technique. The proportion of positive sample for HEV infection is 81 per cent.

A total of 7 deaths have been reported among acute jaundice cases and 1 death in a confirmed HEV case in Mobbar LGA.

Hepatitis E infection is found worldwide. The virus is shed in the stools of infected persons, and enters the human body through the intestine. It is transmitted mainly through contaminated drinking water. Usually the infection is self-limiting and resolves within 2-6 weeks. Occasionally a serious disease, known as fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure) develops, and a proportion of people with this disease can die. According to WHO, every year, there are an estimated 20 million hepatitis E infections worldwide, leading to an estimated 3.3 million symptomatic cases of hepatitis E, and 56 600 hepatitis E-related deaths.

[Hepatitis E virus (HEV) genotypes 1 and 2 are the major waterborne forms of HEV and they tend to occur in the developing world, especially Africa and Asia. These types can cause significant outbreaks with acute hepatitis deaths, especially in 2nd and 3rd trimester pregnant women. Other genotypes especially 3 are zoonotic, with swine being a major reservoir, and tend to be seen in the developed world. Type 3 in particular can cause chronic infection, especially in the immunocompromised host. - Mod.LL
