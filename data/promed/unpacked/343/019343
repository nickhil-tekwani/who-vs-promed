An unidentified disease has affected vegetable cultivations in the northcentral and central [provinces of Sri Lanka]. Due to this disease, in the Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa [North Central], and Matale [Central] districts especially, a large area of cultivations have been destroyed.

The farmers said that there are various characteristics of this disease affecting many vegetables including pumpkin, kekiri [cooking melon], cucumber, water melon, winged beans, bitter gourd, beans, long beans, etc. In addition it is possible to see that paddy too has been affected.

Farmers said that no responsible government official has come to inspect this situation as yet. They requested that the attention of Agriculture Authorities of the [region] be focused on this state of affairs.

[From this report, it is not possible to speculate on the diseases or disorders referred to. It is unlikely that the same disease would affect such a diverse range of crops. While a number of plant pathogens do have a wide host range, it is more likely that more than one crop disease is affecting the area. Alternatively, the problems may be due to environmental factors and not be associated with any infectious agents. Reliable diagnosis would be paramount to providing solutions for the farmers.
