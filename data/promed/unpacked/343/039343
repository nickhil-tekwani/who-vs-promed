African swine fever recorded in Gukovo, Rostov region
----------------------------------------------------
Following the detection of African swine fever [ASF] in Gukovo,
measures have been undertaken by Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service
for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] to control the
dangerous disease. Some violations have been encountered.

In addition to other preventive, surveillance, and control measures,
road control posts have been operated by the police since 27 Feb
2010. The control is, according to information, not yet accomplished.
Several violations have been recorded.

[Gukovo is situated about 5 km (3 mi) from the Russian-Ukrainian
border and can be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive
map at <http://healthmap.org/r/018N>. It may be assumed that
Ukrainian wild boars are not separated from their Russian
counterparts in Rostov, which means a direct, immediate threat of
infection in the Ukraine. Following previous ASF outbreaks in the
Russian Rostov region, preventive steps have been undertaken in
eastern and south eastern Ukraine; see items 4, 5 in ProMED-mail
posting 20091017.3569.

So far, ASF has been reported from 9 main administrative regions in
Russia, all included within the Southern Federal District (map at
<http://www.russiasregions.com/southern_federal_district.html>. The
infected regions were (in chronological order) Chechnya, North
Ossetia-Alania, Orenburg, Ingushetia, Stavropol, Krasnodar, Rostov,
Dagestan, and Kalmykia. Since 11 Sep 2009, when the 2nd epizootic
started, Russia reported to the OIE 38 ASF outbreaks; the last
follow-up report, No 17, was submitted on 18 Feb 2010.

For a summary and an interactive map with all accumulated foci,
marked differentially for domestic swine and wild boars, see
