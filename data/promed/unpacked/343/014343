Bravo Farms Dutch Style Gouda cheese, (Costco item 40654) offered for
sale and in cheese sampling events at Costco Wholesale Corporation
(Costco) locations is preliminarily linked with an outbreak of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 infections. The cheese was available for sale, and free
samples were offered for in-store tasting at Costco stores in
Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada.

Consumers who have any of this cheese should not eat it. They should
return the cheese to the place of purchase or dispose of it in a
closed plastic bag and place in a sealed trash can to prevent people
or animals, including wild animals, from eating it.

As of Thu 4 Nov 2010, 25 persons infected with the outbreak strain of
_E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported from 5 states since mid-October
[2010]. The number of ill persons identified in each state with this
strain is as follows: AZ (11), CA (1), CO (8), NM (3), and NV (2).
There have been 9 reported hospitalizations, 1 possible case of
hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), and no deaths.

[As can be seen in the list of previous postings below, a spate of
infections can be spread through cheese vehicles. Overall, the common
co-factor is the lack of proper pasteurization of milk used to
produce the cheese. No details have been released regarding what
and/or where the process was defective. - Mod.LL]
