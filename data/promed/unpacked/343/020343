The following background information on pertussis in Australia was extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
Epidemics occur every 4 years. Reported number of cases by year:
1984 261
1990 862
1991 337 (2.6/100,000) - 38.9% from Queensland
1992 739
1993 4,453 (25.2/100,000)
1994 5,684 (30.5/100,000)
1995 4,297
1996 4,604
Peak rates occur during August to December. The male/female ratio is
approximately 1/1.3.
As of 1995, routine immunization (DTP) is administered at ages 2, 4, 6 and
18 months. Three-dose coverage was 90% in 1994. Acellular vaccine is
recommended for the 4th dose and as a booster at 4 to 5 years.
