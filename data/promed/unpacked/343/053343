[1] Sweden, tufted ducks and greater scaup

Wildlife avian influenza in Sweden
----------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 16 Mar 2006 from Dr Leif Denneberg,
chief veterinary officer, Swedish Board of Agriculture, Jonkoping:
Date of start of the event: 24 Feb 2006.
Identification of agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Details of outbreaks:
- Oskarshamn: 2 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_) 24 Feb 2006
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/9/Oskarshamn.html>
- Oxelosund: 3 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_) 3 Mar 2006
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/18/Oxelosund.html>
- Karlskrona: 1 greater scaup (_Aythya marila_) 6 Mar 2006
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/2/Karlskrona.html>
- Gotland: 2 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_) 7 Mar 2006
<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701512642/Gotland.html>
- Faro Gotland: 5 tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_) and one greater scaup
(_Aythya marila_) 15 Mar 2006 <http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/5/Faro.html>
A total of 243 dead wild birds from the aforementioned areas were analyzed
between 10 Feb and 15 Mar 2006. 36 were positive for HPAI subtype H5. No
high mortality among wild birds has been noted. It is late in the season,
and temperatures are below freezing, so some dead birds are to be expected
at this time of the year.
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were performed:
1. National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala. PCR (H5 and M genes) sequence
analysis, 24 Feb 2006, positive; amino acid sequence at cleavage site
indicates a highly pathogenic avian influenza profile
2. OIE Reference Laboratory, Veterinary Laboratories Agency, Weybridge,
United Kingdom, virus isolation and N-typing, 15 Mar 2006, positive for
HPAI H5N1 virus

[2] Hong Kong, various species.

Wildlife highly pathogenic avian influenza
------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 20 Mar 2006 from the director of the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong
Identification of agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 4-8 Jan 2006.
Details of outbreaks: This report describes isolation of H5N1 in 16 cases.
The following species were involved: Oriental magpie robin (_Copsychus
saularis_), crested myna (_Acridotheres cristatellus_), chicken** (_Gallus
domesticus_), common magpie (_Pica pica sericea_) little egret (_Egretta
garzetta_), Japanese white-eye (_Zosterops japonica simplex_), munia
(_Lonchura spp._), white-rumped munia (_Lonchura striata_) large-billed
crow (_Corvus macrorhynchus_), house crow (_Corvus splendens_)
** chicken - During the recent enhanced local dead wild bird surveillance
exercise (in progress since October 2005), during which all dead birds
found in Hong Kong are being collected and submitted for avian influenza
testing, 2 dead chickens from different locations were also collected and
submitted. These chickens were not found in a poultry farm or live poultry
markets.
The intensive avian influenza surveillance system in Hong Kong showed no
outbreaks of H5N1 infection in local poultry farms and live poultry markets.
From 2005 to the end of February 2006, over 11 400 fecal or
cloacal/tracheal swabs from local poultry farms, 15 300 from wholesale or
retail live poultry markets, 3200 from waterfowl and aviaries in
recreational parks, 3500 from pet bird shops and markets, and 13 700 from
wild birds were tested in Hong Kong as part of the avian influenza
surveillance program.
There have been no reports of unusual mortality in wild birds.
All chicken farms are routinely vaccinated with inactivated H5N2 vaccine,
and each batch of chickens has 60 unvaccinated individually identified
sentinels, which are monitored over the production life of the batch.
Laboratories where diagnostic tests were performed:
1. Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation
Department, Hong Kong - HA; - real time RT-PCR (H5 gene) - positive
2. Department of Microbiology, University of Hong Kong - RT-PCR (N1 gene):
positive - sequence analysis: amino acid sequence at cleavage site
indicates a highly pathogenic avian influenza profile
The H5-HA genes of these viruses have the highest homology (99 per cent) to
each other's HA1 gene and high homology (98 per cent) to that of
A/Dk/Hunan/5806/03[H5N1]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these viruses
all belong to H5N1 genotype V, which has previously been recorded in
southern China, Japan and South Korea.

[3] Poland, wild swans

Wildlife avian influenza in Poland
----------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 20 Mar 2006 from Dr Krzysztof
Jazdzewski, chief veterinary officer, General Veterinary Inspectorate, Warsaw:
End of previous report period: 13 Mar 2006 (Disease Information 2006;
19[11]: 231, 16 Mar).
Identification of agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 6 Mar 2006.
Date of start of the event: 2 Mar 2006.
New outbreaks: Clinical disease
Description of affected population: wild swans in Bydgoszcz, Bydgoski.
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PL/73/Bydgoszcz.html>
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed:
1. National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy - RT-PCR(1) (H5); -
RT-PCR (N1); - virus isolation; - RT-PCR(1) (H5);- RT-PCR (N1) - virus
isolation; positive.

[4] Kazakhstan, wild swans

Wildlife avian influenza in Kazakhstan
--------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in

methodology in veterinary medicine, National University, Astana: - PCR; -
hemagglutination test; positive for H5.
2. Scientific Research Institute for Agriculture, Otar - rapid test;
positive for H5N1
3. Institute for Microbiology and Virology, Almaty - virus isolation; -

[5] Bosnia and Herzegovina, wild swans

Wildlife avian influenza in Bosnia and Herzegovina
--------------------------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 22 Mar 2006 from Dr Jozo Bagaric, head
of the State Veterinary Administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo:
Precise identification of agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 16 Feb 2006.
Details of outbreak (reminder): 2 swans out of about 150 swans at Plivsko
lake, Srednjobosanski (44.34694o N17.18855o E16) were found to be positive
for avian influenza. 15 swans were destroyed. By 22 Feb 2006, all 2872
domestic poultry present within a 3 km radius around Plivsko Lake, where
the positive swans were found, were killed and disposed of in a safe manner.
From 2 to 5 Mar 2006, intensive sampling was carried out in the
surveillance zone (10 km radius around Plivsko lake), during which 1214
samples were obtained from the domestic poultry population (blood samples
and cloacal swabs); all the samples gave negative results. There have been
no new cases, and all animals tested in the surveillance zone have given
negative results. From 22 Mar 2006, all the protection measures applied in
the area of the outbreak will be lifted.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: OIE Reference Laboratory,
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), Weybridge, United Kingdom - virus
isolation; - positive for H5N1; - sequence analysis; - amino acid sequence
at cleavage site indicates a highly pathogenic avian influenza profile.

[With respect to part 1 of this update, while there are many reasons
seroprevalence as reported in this part of Sweden may be a very inaccurate
measure, the seropositive percentage (I won't even say rate) in dead birds
reported here is about 15 per cent. There is some allusion to the fact that
dead birds are not unexpected at this time of year, so it would be
interesting to know whether the seropositive percentage in healthy birds in
the area was similar.
Also noteworthy in these reports are the large number of bird species, like
robins and crows, found to be infected with avian influenza in Hong Kong.
Finally, Bosnia and Herzegovina report lifting restrictions on poultry
since they tested negative, despite the identification of positive swans in
the area. While we don't have all the details, it seems as if it might be
prudent to sample for a longer period before lifting movement restrictions,
etc. - Mod.PC]
