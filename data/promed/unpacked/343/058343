Abstract
--------
Background: Diphtheria is uncommon in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. Nevertheless, sporadic cases, sometimes fatal, continue to be reported.

Aim: To report on diphtheria cases and coverage with 1st and 3rd doses of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccines (DTP1 and DTP3, respectively) for 2010-19 in the Region with a focus on 2019.

Methods: Data on diphtheria cases were obtained from WHO/United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) Joint Reporting Forms submitted annually by the Region's Member States. WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization Coverage for DTP1 and DTP3 were summarised for 2010-19. For 2019, we analysed data on age, and vaccination status and present data by country on DTP1 and DTP3 coverage and the percentage of districts with ≥ 90% and < 80% DTP3 coverage.

Results: For 2010-19, 451 diphtheria cases were reported in the Region. DTP1 and DTP3 coverage was 92-96% and 95-97%, respectively. For 2019, 52 cases were reported by 11 of 48 countries that submitted reports (including zero reporting). Thirty-nine countries submitted data on percentage of their districts with ≥ 90% and < 80% DTP3 coverage; 26 had ≥ 90% districts with ≥ 90% coverage while 11 had 1-40% districts with < 80% coverage.

Conclusion: Long-standing high DTP3 coverage at regional level probably explains the relatively few diphtheria cases reported in the Region. Suboptimal surveillance systems and inadequate laboratory diagnostic capacity may also be contributing factors. Still, the observed cases are of concern. Attaining high DTP3 coverage in all districts and implementing recommended booster doses are necessary to control diphtheria and prevent outbreaks.

[Diphtheria is a potentially fatal disease caused by toxigenic strains of _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_, or _C. pseudotuberculosis_, aerobic gram-positive bacilli that can cause respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacilli are infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin.

The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure), and neuritis (e.g., paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm). Non-toxin-producing strains may cause mild to moderate pharyngitis. Although either toxigenic or nontoxigenic strains can cause cutaneous diphtheria, toxic cardiac or neurologic manifestations are uncommon in cutaneous diphtheria, even when caused by toxigenic strains. Acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur even in vaccinated contacts, since vaccine-induced immunity is anti-toxin.

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Travel to an endemic area is a risk factor for acquisition of _C. diphtheriae_. _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_ cause zoonotic infection in humans (http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/prevguid/m0051752/m0051752.asp) and contact with a companion animal is a risk factor for acquisition of _C. ulcerans_.

The WHO data for diphtheria in the European region may be a mix of respiratory diphtheria and non-respiratory presentations of the disease, but most cases were said to be likely cases of respiratory diphtheria, since the WHO-recommended surveillance standards for diphtheria before their revision in 2018 focused specifically on respiratory disease presentation. Revised WHO-recommended surveillance standards recommended countries to expand the case definition of suspected diphtheria to include non-healing ulcers in a person with a travel history to countries with endemic disease or countries with diphtheria outbreaks. - Mod.ML
