Outbreak of postbloom fruit drop of citrus, caused by _Colletotrichum
acutatum_, in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil

Postbloom fruit drop (PFD), caused by _Colletotrichum acutatum_, [Ca] is an
important disease of citrus, especially in orchards planted in humid areas
of the Americas (Timmer et al., 1994). In Brazil, PFD was first reported in
1979 and causes variable yield losses depending on the weather conditions
(Feichtenberger, 1994). Until recently, the disease was not considered
serious in the southern state of Santa Catarina, in which about 100 sq. km
is planted with citrus.
In 2002, PFD symptoms were reported in numerous orchards in western Santa
Catarina. These were reddish brown spots on petal tissues followed by
abscission of fruitlets at the base of the ovary, with the basal disk,
calyx and peduncle remaining firmly attached to the tree. These persistent
calyces (buttons) are diagnostic for the disease and may persist for many
months after flowering (Timmer et al., 1994).
In September, during the main flowering period, weather conditions were
particularly suitable for disease development, as the mean temperature
during the month was low (11.1C) and associated with long periods of leaf
wetness. Severity of infection was estimated by the number of infected
flowers and persistent calyces observed on 20 trees randomly distributed in
a 7-year-old "Rubi" sweet orange orchard.
On each tree, the number of buttons in a 1 sq. m quadrant was counted. An
average of 58.6 persistent calyces per sq. m was calculated and 100 percent
yield losses were observed. 5 isolates of a slow-growing fungus were
recovered from calyces plated on PDA. After 7 days of incubation at 25C in
the dark, there was abundant production of orange conidial masses. Conidia
were mostly fusiform, without setae and were 11.5 ± 1.1 micrometers long by
4.0 ± 0.5 micrometers wide. The morphological characteristics of these
isolates fit the description of Ca (Agostini et al., 1992, Brown et al., 1996).
Flowers of 3- to 4-year-old potted sweet orange trees in a screenhouse were
inoculated with a conidial suspension (100 000 conidia per ml). A control
treatment was sprayed with distilled water only. The characteristic reddish
brown lesions on the petals were observed on the inoculated flowers and Ca
was reisolated from the infected tissues, fulfilling Koch's postulates.
This is the first report of a significant outbreak of PFD in Santa Catarina
State, Brazil.

[Postbloom fruit drop (PFD) of citrus was first reported in Belize in 1979
and has since spread to Florida, the Carribean, and South America. Sweet
orange and lime are susceptible, and substantial yield reduction has been
reported in Florida. In Australia, Ca has been widely recorded as causing a
ripe fruit rot of many fruits including pawpaw (_Asimina triloba_) and
strawberry. Though our resources -- which are not up-to-date -- state that
PBFD has not been recorded to date in Australia, I hope that our readers in
Australia will provide more relevant data. Disease management basically
involves applications of systemic fungicides or copper fungicides. - Mod.DH]
