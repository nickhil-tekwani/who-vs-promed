African swine fever (ASF) has occurred in 45 provinces and cities in Viet Nam since early this year [2020], leading to the culling of 34 000 pigs, Vietnam News Agency cited the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as reporting on Monday [29 Jun 2020].

While some of the localities have been declared clear of the epidemic, currently 238 communes of 19 localities are still suffering from the disease, with an ASF outbreak reported within the past 30 days, according to the report.

There is a high possibility that ASF will continue to reoccur and widely spread, which will seriously affect the restock and pork supply, said the report.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development ordered localities to enhance the control of pig transport to prevent the spread and recurrence of the disease, as well as asked relevant authorities to send technical officers to the localities with swine fever to coordinate with local authorities in tackling the outbreak, the news agency reported.

In 2019, ASF spread to all provinces and cities in Viet Nam, leading to the death and culling of about 5.9 million pigs, according to the news agency.
