2nd Monmouth County horse farm quarantined amid equine herpes
outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tourelay Farm and Overbrook Farm see activity restricted for 3
weeks.

A 2nd horse farm in Colts Neck, Monmouth County, has been quarantined
as part of a state Department of Agriculture [NJDA] investigation into
an outbreak of the neurologic form of equine herpesvirus, type 1
(EHV-1) that has led to the death of 1 horse and sickened 5 others.

The disease was discovered on Wednesday [13 Apr 2011) by a private
veterinarian treating a sick horse at the 1st farm, Overbrook Farm.
The filly was euthanized by the veterinarian after it failed to
respond to treatment. 5 other Overbrook Farm horses are recovering
from the illnesses.

The Agriculture Department's tracing activities at Overbrook Farm to
determine the extent of the outbreak led to Friday's [15 Apr 2011]
quarantine of Tourelay Farm but no sick horses have been reported
there.

Overbrook Farm was quarantined Thursday (14 Apr 2011), meaning horse
movement on and off the property has ceased and only essential farm
personnel are allowed access to limit the spread of the virus. While
the disease is not dangerous to humans, personnel must utilize
biosecurity measures, such as disinfectant foot baths, coveralls,
disposable gloves, hand washing and disinfectant hand gels, and
non-sharing of tack between horses.

The Overbrook Farm and Tourelay Farm quarantines are expected to last
21 days, unless more horses become ill. All quarantines are based on
risk assessment.

The Agriculture Department has been in contact with Colts Neck
Township officials to keep them informed of the efforts to contain the
virus and protect animals.

The EHV-1 virus spreads quickly from horse to horse, has a high
morbidity, and can cause a wide range of clinical signs, from a
complete lack of clinical signs to respiratory problems, especially in
young horses, and spontaneous abortions in pregnant mares. The
neurologic form of EHV-1, additionally, can cause an acute paralytic
syndrome, which results in a high mortality. The incubation period of
EHV-1 is typically 2 to 10 days. The virus spreads readily through
direct contact with infected materials.

The virus does not affect other domestic animals, with the exception
of llamas and alpacas.

Concerned owners should consult their veterinarian prior to taking
any action as the clinical signs of infection with the neurological
form of EHV-1 are common to many other diseases. The neurologic form
of EHV is a reportable disease in New Jersey.

More information about the disease, in PDF format, is available at
http://www.nj.gov/agriculture/divisions/ah/pdf/equine_herpesvirus_brochure_2009.pdf.

If an owner has a horse that is exhibiting neurologic signs or
suspects equine herpes, they are directed to call their veterinarian
immediately.

The NJDA Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory provides testing for the
neurologic form of EHV-1. For more information for to
