Dr YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry (UHF) advised to start management of apple core rot disease which, over the past few years, has emerged as one of the major constraints in apple production. It affects almost every orchard of [Himachal Pradesh] resulting in loss of 30 to 40 per cent.

"Every year this disease results in economic loss of Rs 720 million [about USD 11 million] to the state as the affected fruits initially do not produce any symptoms," officials said. The fungi responsible for the rot remain incipient till fruits start ripening. The seed core shows dry or wet rot. Such fruits have a bitter taste [and] are also unsafe for consumption as the fungi produce lots of mycotoxins.

UHF's Dr AK Gupta said, "This disease occurs frequently due to the fungi _Alternaria alternata_ and _Trichothecium roseum_." Pruning of trees is suggested to allow sunlight and air. At the pink bud stage, [fungicide] spray is recommended.

[Dry core rot (or mouldy core) is an orchard disease, while wet core rot develops mainly in storage. Both diseases have been reported to be associated with a range of fungi from different genera, including _Alternaria_, _Cladosporium_, _Coniothyrium_, _Stemphylium_, and _Penicillium_, many of which are also associated with other diseases and/or crops. Presence of different fungi seems to depend on location, host cultivar and environment. Susceptibility to these rots varies in apple cultivars, but many commercial varieties are susceptible. As stated above, external fruit symptoms are often absent but may include discolouration, premature ripening, and fruit drop. The infections may stay confined to the seed chamber but can also develop into rotting of the fruit flesh.

Generally, the dry rot fungi colonise the flowers and enter the developing fruit through the calyx. They can be spread by insect activity, wind and water. Disease development is favoured by humidity during flowering which encourages both spore formation of the pathogens to increase the amount of inoculum, and insect activity to help with spread. Factors increasing the frequency of fruit cracking at the calyx end, for example insect infestation, facilitate entry of the spores. Disease management mostly relies on cultural practices and orchard hygiene; fungicide sprays, especially during blooming, have been reported to give some control of the pathogens but to be unreliable.
