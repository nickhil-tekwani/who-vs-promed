Tourist Infected With Cholera
------------------------------
Quarantine officials announced yesterday, 3 Jul 2005, that a Korean man who
returned from the Philippines was found to be infected with cholera,
calling for [more stringent] hygienic [rules].
"A Korean male tourist, who is in quarantine now, has shown some symptoms
of cholera such as diarrhea and high fever when he returned home on 30 Jun
2005," Park Sun-hee, an official at the state-run Korea Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (KCDC), told The Korea Times. She added that the
patient in his 30s has almost completely recovered from the illness.
Park said that the KCDC is conducting an epidemiological test of the germ
carrier as well as the tourist's family members. She said KCDC officials
are also trying to find out the source of the virus. The official added
that it is in the process of testing 234 passengers and crew members still
in Korea who were on the same flight.
No additional cholera patient has been reported yet, but people who are
traveling to Southeast Asian countries should remain on alert, according to
the quarantine office. The disease control agency advised people to drink
boiled water, eat well-cooked food and wash hands before having meals to
avoid cholera infection.

DOH reports woman in Tainan may have contracted cholera
---------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health Department discovered what may be the 2nd
indigenous cholera case in Taiwan in 2005 on Mon, 4 Jul 2005, after
checking the stool of a woman who has developed symptoms of the contagious
disease.
Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH Center for Disease Control, said
that further examination is necessary before they can confirm that the
woman they found in Tainan City, southern Taiwan, has indeed contracted
cholera.
Earlier in Jul 2005, another woman in Hsinying City, Tainan County, was
confirmed to be afflicted with cholera after touching and eating what might
have been the contaminated food that she bought from a traditional market
near her home.
Shih described the 2 women who developed symptoms of cholera as separate
cases without any relation geographically or socially. The patients have
been quarantined and given proper treatment at different medical
facilities, he said. Shih also said that his center was cooperating with
the Tainan City Health Bureau in examining the patient's family members and
their living environment. Preliminary investigation shows there was no sign
of contamination.
The deputy director claimed that chances of cholera spreading in Taiwan are
small, as "most people have a good sense of sanitation" and their living
conditions are also better than those in most other countries. Shih said he
did not expect Taiwan to be proclaimed a cholera-affected area.

[3] Cholera - Taiwan (Tainan)

CDC focuses on sanitation amid cholera cases probe
-----------------------
Following the release of test results which show a marked increase of
non-toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_, the bacterium that causes cholera, in the
environment, an official from the Center for Disease Control noted on Wed,
6 Jul 2005 that regional sanitation in southern counties had taken a turn
for the worse since widespread flooding in Jun 2005.
Tainan County and Tainan City, where Taiwan's 2 confirmed indigenous
cholera cases surfaced in Jun and Jul 2005, have both seen a deterioration
in sanitation conditions, said CDC division director Yang Kuo-hsi. However,
the CDC currently has no evidence to link the rise in bacteria levels and
the cases.
Even though both confirmed cholera cases were caused by the more harmful
toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_ Ogawa O1 strain and probably have no direct
link to the flooding, the public should still take precautions against
infection from the non-toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_, said Yang.
The CDC speculates that proliferation of the non-toxigenic bacterium was a
result of the flooding in southern counties in Jun 2005, when water in
fishponds and septic tanks overflowed into the surrounding environment. The
public should pay greater attention to food hygiene in the summer period,
the CDC division chief urged.
Yang and his colleagues went to Tainan on Wednesday to determine the source
of the 2nd case of indigenous cholera, a 78-year-old female resident of the
southern city.
The recent cases mark the 1st time in 5 years that Taiwan has recorded
indigenous outbreaks of the acute intestinal disease. The 2nd case was
reported to the CDC early this week, after the patient fell ill on 26 Jun
2005, the CDC said. The victim was quarantined and is currently being
treated in Chi-Mei Hospital, the same facility where the first reported
cholera sufferer was treated.
As the 2 patients were both hospitalized in Chi-Mei Hospital, Yang and his
colleagues also needed to clarify whether the 2nd case was contracted
inside the facility. After the Wed 6 Jul 2005 inspection, Yang played down
rumors that the 1st patient gave the disease to the 2nd victim within the
hospital. "They were hospitalized in different sickrooms. Our investigation
suggests that there should be no relation between the 2 cases."
The CDC had reported both cases to the WHO, and said it is "fulfilling its
duty as a member of the international community." CDC deputy director Shih
Wen-yi disclosed, however, that the WHO had no record of receiving the 1st
report of indigenous cholera from Taiwan that was sent on 23 Jun 2005.

Gastroenteritis kills 18 in Pakistan
-------------------------------------
At least 18 people have died from gastroenteritis in a remote town in
Pakistan's Balochistan province, reports and doctors said on Thu, 7 Jul 2005.
The disease has spread in Zhob city, some 250 northeast of the provincial
capital Quetta, and its adjoining areas, Doctor Rahim in the local
government hospital said. Children and women are also among the victims,
private ARY TV channel quoted Rahim as saying. Many others have also been
affected, according to the report.
Rahim said that emergency has been declared in the local hospital but added
that the hospital is running out of medicines to deal with the epidemic. He
appealed to the provincial government and the health department to
immediately send medical teams and more medicines. The doctor said scores
of new gastroenteritis-affected patients daily come to hospital, and the
lone government hospital is facing problems to deal with the situation.

21 people have died in western and central Guinea in a new cholera outbreak
that has infected 345 people since 15 Jun 2005, the health ministry said in
a statement broadcast over public radio. Clinicians and emergency services
have been rushed to the infected areas, which include the capital Conakry.
Guinea is the latest country in West Africa to be hit by an outbreak of the
water-borne illness, which is transmitted through poor hygiene in food
preparation and sanitation.

Cholera Threatens Liberia's Population
---------------------------------------
With the intensity of the rainy season now in Liberia, Liberians need to be
vigilant to protect themselves from the deadly and endemic disease of
cholera, which is preventable but remains a threat "especially to children
under the age of 5 -- dying from the diarrhea and dehydration cholera
causes," according to health minister Dr. Peter S. Coleman.
Speaking recently in Monrovia Dr. Coleman said that there have been
confirmed cases of cholera in Nimba and Sinoe Counties during the past 18
days. "A person may get cholera by drinking water or eating food
contaminated with the cholera bacterium. The source of the contamination is
usually the feces of an infected person. The disease can spread rapidly in
areas with inadequate treatment of sewage and drinking water, with poor
hygiene practices in too many parts of our country; cholera is a threat to
any Liberian who does not take care of their surroundings," the minister added.
The UNICEF Representative to Liberia Angela Kearney said that cholera
surveillance and data collection teams are also being strengthened,
especially in Sinoe and Nimba Counties, where recent cases of cholera have
been reported. She said that mass communication program is underway to
disseminate the information Liberians need to protect their families and
communities from this child-killing disease.

Mali cholera outbreak claims 14 lives
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of cholera triggered by heavy rains has killed at least 14
people in western Mali since late June 2005, local authorities said on Mon,
4 Jul 2005. Residents in 3 villages in the Kayes district of the West
African country, which borders Senegal, had been told to stop using water
from the Senegal river for fear of contamination, the region's medical
officer said.
"We have confirmed 14 deaths among 110 cases of cholera," Cheikna Drame,
health director of the Kayes district, said in a statement. Health
officials were battling to stop the waterborne infection spreading further.
Africa had been free of cholera -- an intestinal infection spread by
contaminated water and food -- for more than a century, when the disease
hit western regions in 1970. It quickly spread and eventually became
endemic across most of the continent.

Over 1000 cholera cases recorded as epidemic spreads beyond capital
---------------------------------------------------
A cholera epidemic that broke out in the capital Bissau in Jun 2005 is
spreading into the interior of the country, with more than 400 new cases
reported nationwide over the past week, health officials said Fri, 1 Jul 2005.
Since the beginning of the epidemic on 11 Jun 2005, a total of 1027 cases
have been registered, including 12 deaths, said Simao Mendes, director of
Bissau's General Hospital. The hospital is struggling to cope and has more
than 300 people suffering from the water-borne disease currently crammed
into wards, he said.
Mendes said 981 of the cholera cases detected so far had occurred in the
capital, but an increasing number of people were falling sick with the
disease in other parts of this small West African country.
In the 5 days since 26 Jun 2005, 425 new cases have been reported,
including 46 outside Bissau, he said. There have been 34 cases of cholera
in Biombo region near the capital, 6 in Cacheu in the northwest, 5 in
northern Oio and 1 in Quinara in the south. 8 people have died in the
capital and 4 more in the interior, Mendes said.
Earlier, Portugal, the former colonial power in Guinea-Bissau, announced
that it was flying in 15 tons of drugs and medical equipment to help deal
with the emergency. Health Minister Odete Semedo said on Wed, 29 Jun 2005
that Lisbon was supplying rehydration fluid, disinfectant, rubber gloves
and other essential equipment.
