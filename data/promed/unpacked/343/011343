The president of the Federation of Neighborhood Committees of Bermejo, Freddy Valdez, has asked the Municipal Bureau of Health to declare Bermejo endemic [for leishmaniasis] due to an alarming number cases.

"We are already in a state of emergency, but we demand that Bermejo be declared endemic for leishmaniasis," said Valdez. "Never before have 41 positive cases of leishmaniasis been seen in 7 months. Previously, leishmaniasis was found only in rural areas, but we now have positive cases in peripheral and central neighborhoods, raising fears that the disease is spreading and will develop into an epidemic. We are asking the health authorities and the Coordinator of the Network of Health to adopt concrete, real, visible, and immediate actions such as citywide weeding, weeding of green areas and of vacant lots. Once clear of weeds, they must perform fumigation."

The community leader said it is no longer a priority for health workers to visit neighborhoods to explain what leishmaniasis is, but priority should be given to the implementation of actions and preventive measures, considering that the transmitters [sandflies] are already in the city.

[Bolivia has the highest incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Latin America, with 33 cases per 100 000 population reported in 2006. The considerable scale of migration from Andean to tropical areas and uncontrolled logging are 2 of the main reasons for the emergence of new highly active foci that are continually increasing in scale and extent. Migrants moving into endemic areas have been proposed to be more susceptible to infection.

Since 1983, the incidence of CL has increased from 278 cases reported in 1983 to 3153 in 2007, and since 1997, over 2000 cases have been reported annually. As most cases are identified through passive case detection, underreporting is suspected to be high (Alvar et al. Leishmaniasis Worldwide and Global Estimates of its Incidence. PLoS ONE 2012;7(5): e35671 http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671).

Bermejo is at the border with Argentina and is in the tropical lowlands described as endemic. - Mod.EP
