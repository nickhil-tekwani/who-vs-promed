BSE, case surge - Ireland 981130210323

From: John Collins <dan.collins@ucd.ie>

Regarding the BAB issue here in Ireland, the prohibition on the feeding of
feed containing ruminant derived protein was introduced in August, 1990.
Realistically, effective enforcement of the ban probably dates from 1991 or
later.
166 of the 334 cases (which includes cases in 14 imported cattle) were born
in 1991 or later, viz. 56 born in 1991, 65 in 1992, 34 in 1993 and 11 in
1994.
In 1996, licensing rules were applied to restrict the manufacture of
ruminant feed to mills which did not produce pig or poultry feed. Prior to
this it is likely that cross contamination of ruminant feed with
pig/poultry feed containing imported meat and bone meal represented the
major exposure risk for cattle. These rules are now being rigidly enforced
and have been so for the last two years.
[Concerning the recent surge in cases I cannot offer any explanation other
than that at this time of the year, when cattle are being more closely
observed and when farmers are less busy, cases are more likely to be seen.
We have experienced this winter rise in case numbers each year for the last
three years.
One could also suggest that the stresses of late pregnancy may precipitate
clinical signs at this time of the year, since ~80% of our cows calve down
in January - March. Not a very strong case, however, at this stage.
In all countries there can be expected to be a degree of under-reporting.
So, as the government here offers compensation above the market price for
all herds depopulated, reporting a suspect case may present an advantage to
some herd owners. However, I hasten to add that less than 50% of suspect
cases that go to autopsy are confirmed as BSE cases, suggesting that the
submission rate here is reasonable or better.

[I should point out that Dan is the Head of the Department of Large Animal
Clinical Studies at the Republic of Ireland Veterinary School with an
extraordinary network of contacts in the Republic. As to the level of
present Irish reporting, the British diagnostic rate was around 83% of
submitted suspect beasts with an admitted but unknown level of
under-reporting, Anderson's estimates notwithstanding. At 50% one might
believe with Dan that they are seeing most if not all BSE cases at present
as the Irish farmers go in for the lottery of getting better than market
price for their sick and otherwise essentially worthless animals. -
