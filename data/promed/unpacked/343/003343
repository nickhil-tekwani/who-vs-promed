[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 18 newly confirmed cases in China, 7 of which were imported and 11 acquired locally (9 in Beijing municipality, 2 in Hebei province). While there is no mention of association with the outbreak in Beijing, Hebei province has had locally acquired cases previously associated with the outbreak ongoing in Beijing. No new deaths were reported. 3 new cases were reported in Hong Kong. A total of 1876 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 7 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 1 was imported. There was 1 case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time, and 2 cases were reported on 14,18, and 20 Jun 2020. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 17 cases with no new deaths, compared with 48 cases and 0 new deaths in the previous day (20 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 73 consecutive days. Today's (21 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 11 cases were locally transmitted and 6 were imported. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (4), Gyeonggi (3), Chungnam (2) Daegu (1), and Jeonbuk (1). Imported cases were in Gyeonggi (3), Seoul (1), Incheon (1) and Gyeongbuk (1). Note that 10 provinces plus airport quarantine station did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The impression hasn't changed: Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. That said, it looks as if the proportion of locally acquired cases is decreasing daily, and provinces outside of Seoul, Gyeonggi and Daejeon have seen little local transmission.

The English language page (current one with the 17 cases reported above, becomes available after I log off) is worth checking. Notice 388 gives updates on the clusters that had additional cases added yesterday 20 Jun 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030).

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 238 499 cases, including 34 634 deaths, up by +224 cases and 24 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (20 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was +264 cases and 49 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 128 newly confirmed cases, down from 165 the previous day.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4922_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4922_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (128) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 18 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (7 provinces reported no new cases), with only 2 other provinces reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Piedmont 26 cases and Emilia-Romagna 23 cases). The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 48 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 32 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 204 952 total cases, 9623 deaths

Iranian health authorities reported over 100 new deaths from the COVID-19 disease Sunday [21 Jun 2020] for the 3rd day running, stressing that the outbreak had not yet peaked in the country that has been hit hard by the pandemic.

Health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said the 116 deaths reported Sunday [21 Jun 2020] had brought the country's overall coronavirus toll to 9623. She added that 2368 new infections had been confirmed, bringing to 204 952 the total number of cases in Iran.

Health Minister Said Namaki, however, denied that Iran was facing a 2nd wave of the outbreak, saying "the peak of the disease has not passed." "Even in provinces where we think the 1st coronavirus wave is behind us, we have not yet fully experienced the 1st wave," he added.

Iran recorded its lowest single-day death toll in early May [2020], before seeing a new spike in infections in recent weeks.

The authorities have not imposed a mandatory lockdown on the population but closed schools, cancelled public events, and banned movement between the country's 31 provinces in March [2020], before gradually easing restrictions starting in April.

According to Lari, 4 provinces -- Khuzestan, Hormozgan, Kermanshah, and East Azerbaijan -- were currently "red", the highest level on the country's color-coded risk scale.

[As of 21 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 204 952, including 9623 deaths, an increase of 2368 cases and 116 deaths since 20 Jun 2020. The number of provinces designated as red zones has changed from 7 on 19 and 20 Jun 2020 to today's (21 Jun 2020) announcement of 4 provinces.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having overtaken the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a recrudescence (a challenge as to whether to call this a continuance of the 1st wave with transmission never having been interrupted, or to acknowledge there while had been relative control of the outbreak that was lost due to restrictions being lifted too early. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2-3 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran about 4-6 weeks after the lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while major active transmission was continuing.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 356 657, including 122 247 deaths, an increase from 2 330 578 cases and 121 980 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 209 313 cases as of 13:30 EDT (GMT-4) on 21 Jun 2020, including 17 596 confirmed deaths and an additional 4682 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Florida, Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, New York, Illinois, and Tennessee. Louisiana dropped off this list and Tennessee joined it. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by California, New Jersey, Illinois, Texas, Massachusetts, Florida, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Georgia (having surpassed Maryland in the past 24 hours). A total of 41 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
