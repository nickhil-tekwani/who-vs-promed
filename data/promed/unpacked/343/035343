A psittacosis outbreak in Belgian customs officers

Dr Koen de Schrijver, Health Inspector, Antwerp, Belgium.
Epidemiologisch bulletin van de Gezondheidinspectie van de Vlaamse
Gemeenschap, 1995, (2) January.

In March 1994, health authorities in Antwerp, Belgium, were informed
that a member of a team of 15 customs officers had developed
psittacosis. The customs officer concerned had been admitted to
hospital with pneumonia 10 days after exposure to parakeets that had
been imported illegally by an Indian sailor.

The 15 customs officers who had possibly been exposed to the birds
were surveyed using a telephone questionnaire. A probable case of
psittacosis was defined by a history of clinical atypical pneumonia.
A confirmed case was defined by the isolation of Chlamydia psittaci
or seroconversion. C. psittaci was identified at the zoological
centre laboratory by the Stamp colouration reaction and antibody
levels were measured by complement fixation.

The first patient was a 54 year old customs officer admitted to
hospital with atypical pneumonia, who developed antibodies against
C. psittaci. Six other officers, who had been in contact with the
birds while they were held in the customs office, developed atypical
pneumonia. Two cases of psittacosis were confirmed serologically.
The attack rate was 47% (7 of 15). The risk of contracting
psittacosis was 2.8 times higher in officers exposed for more than 2
hours to parakeets than for those briefly exposed (Fisher's exact
test p = 0.03).

Necropsy of one of the parakeets revealed pericardial lesions
typical of C. psittaci infection. It is thought that the customs
officers handled the birds without adequate protection, increasing
their risk of acquiring the infection. Preventive measures to avoid
future outbreaks have been implemented: customs officers have
received health education; procedures have been developed for
handling, transporting and captivity of confiscated birds;
protective clothing has been supplied for customs officers at risk
of potentially infectious contact; and medical surveillance of
officers was strengthened in collaboration with occupational health
services.

This outbreak is a reminder of the infectivity of C. psittaci. The
results of the survey emphasise the need for notification and close
collaboration between clinicians, epidemiologists, and zoologists.
