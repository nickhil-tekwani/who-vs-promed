The number of victims of staphylococcal infection after swimming at the Etang-Sale beach in recent weeks is increasing, so much so that the Civis [Communaute des Villes Solidaires du Sud] (Inter City Community Organization) plans to analyze the water quality in the Basin Pirogue.

Samples have been taken by the ARS [Agence Regionale de Sante) (Regional Health Agency) in recent weeks in the supervised swimming area. Dozens of people who visit the area regularly or occasionally complain of the same illness.

Since February 2013, a great many fishermen, surfers and even swimmers develop cuts whose surface widens and becomes infected. Some even had fever and had to be hospitalized in serious condition at the Hospital of Saint-Pierre.

"An old colleague, a fisherman, had wounds on his hand and foot that got infected and then developed into a generalized infection. Until recently, he was in the ICU," said a fisherman who grew up in Etang-Sale les Bains. "I've lived here for 50 years; I've never heard of such infections. I usually heal after 3 or 4 days. I had several small wounds which were initially tiny sores, but then they got bigger and got infected. I had to take antibiotics. The sores eventually healed, but the treatment did not work for some of my colleagues."

The same problem can be found among the surfers at the Etang-Sale club. "Our security guards and at least 2 of our students have developed a staphylococcal infection. I have been surfing here for 20 years, I have never seen anything like this. One of our friends was hospitalized. A doctor prescribed oral antibiotics and antibacterial ointment to all of us, but it did not work for him." After an intravenous antibiotic treatment, the young man got better. A teenager surfer lists the names of friends and family who are affected, while showing infected wounds on his feet: "We all had the same illness. It started in mid-February 2013; Felleng [a cyclone] hit, and afterwards the council had the storm water cleaned. I remember it well. The days that followed, we were teaching a surf class, but the water was so dirty that we had to cancel."

Jerome, one of the leaders at the surf club, described the pain caused by his wounds: "It is a very sharp pain. It really hurts. On a scale from one to 10, I would say that the pain is a 6 or 7." A body-boarder also affected by the same illness says: "I also felt severe pain in the groin. The infected wounds were also swollen, and a lot of pus was discharged."

A week ago, a swimmer at Etang-Sale developed the same symptoms the following day. "I went there with friends. We spent an hour in the water. I had a small wound on my foot but nothing serious. But the next day, it started to hurt a lot and even with the antiseptic lotion, it has not healed yet. I am shocked by the attitude of the people in charge of this area. Some measures must be taken to determine whether or not the beach is polluted."

The Civis, which is responsible for monitoring the swimming areas at Etang-Sale, said that samples were recently taken in the swimming area monitored by lifeguards. "These samples came back normal," it said. However, Civis believes, "that given the proliferation of infections brought to our attention, further analysis should be performed in the Basin Pirogue. If the mayor who has police power of this place agrees, then we will ask the ARS to take samples in this basin. Although swimming is forbidden because of the risks due to the current, the beach is used by many residents to cool off and also by a lot of children who play in the water."

Yesterday [1 Apr 2013], the mayor acknowledged he had had the Etang-Sale storm water networks cleaned. "But we have taken the necessary precautions. Beforehand, the environmental service cleaned the waste that was there." The municipality explained that during and after heavy rains, "natural" pollution was generated by the discharge of overflow water from the pond into the Basin Pirogue. People should be careful when swimming there until further notice.

[_Staphylococcus aureus_ is classically associated with infection of skin that has been traumatized. Although sea water is not a typical risk factor, _S. aureus_ can have such a link, even methicillin resistant organisms.
