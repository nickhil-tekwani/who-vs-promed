Sprouts recalled after salmonella outbreak
-------------------------------------------
Harmony Farms of Auburn, WA recalled its brand of alfalfa sprouts
from stores in Washington, Oregon, and Alaska after it was linked to
a salmonella outbreak. The sprouts sickened 6 Oregonians and possibly
a Washington resident, said Dr. William Keene, epidemiologist with
the Oregon Department of Health Services. "Consumers who have them
in their refrigerators should discard them immediately," he said.
The recalled sprouts were distributed through several wholesalers to
grocery stores, restaurants, and other retail outlets. Retail
sprouts were sold in 5-oz. plastic "clamshell" packages labeled as
"Fresh Alfalfa Sprouts," "Gourmet Salad Sprouts," and "Fresh Alfalfa
and Oregon Onion Sprouts," and in 1-pound, 2-pound, and 3-pound
commercial packs. State and federal agencies are working with the
company to remove potentially contaminated sprouts from distribution.
It is the 2nd salmonella outbreak for the grower this year. In March
2003, 13 people in Oregon and Southwest Washington were sickened
after they ate its sprouts.
