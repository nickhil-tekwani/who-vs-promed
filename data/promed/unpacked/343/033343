A case of anthrax in cattle was confirmed in the Dirranbandi-St George area [of Queensland] in early July 2018. This detection is the 4th incident in cattle in the region since 2016.

Animal owners in southern Queensland -- particularly in the Dirranbandi to St George area -- should be alert to anthrax and the risks to human and animal health. Vaccination of livestock can prevent unnecessary livestock deaths. Talk to your private veterinarian about anthrax vaccination. Officials are reminding producers to adhere to the general biosecurity obligation (GBO) in preventing and managing incidents of anthrax.

In addition, in the case of an animal that has died suddenly, officials say that producers should contact a private veterinarian who can assist in determining the cause and provide biosecurity advice to protect human and animal health.

Anthrax can infect humans (meaning there are additional considerations to be made to protect people), and incidents in livestock can have significant economic, environmental, and animal health and welfare impacts.

Anthrax typically presents as sudden death in livestock and can affect a wide variety of species (cattle, sheep, goats, and camelids are particularly susceptible). The disease often causes carcasses to bloat quickly and may cause bloody or tarry discharges from carcass orifices. It can affect one to 2 animals in small incidents and exceed 100 animals in large outbreaks.

Soil that is contaminated with anthrax can be infective for decades (see map of the "anthrax belt" in the news report at the source URL). Management of an anthrax incident may include disposal, decontamination, and vaccination.

[This report informs of an unexpected bovine death, unreported in early July 2018, to have been from anthrax. This area [Dirranbandi-St George, Queensland] has had a problem observing anthrax deaths because of a perceived confusion with pimelea plant toxicity, and this initiated a meeting to sort it out for the ranchers (see ProMED-mail 6 Jun 2018: Anthrax - Australia (04): (QL) cattle, susp confused with pimelea toxicity 20180606.5843188). Hopefully from now on, any unexpected death, regardless of the cause, will result in contacting the ranch veterinarian and the submission of suitable samples for confirmation. It is too expensive to miss diagnosing any anthrax case, especially if among livestock. - Mod.MHJ
