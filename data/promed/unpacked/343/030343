This year [2022], Maharashtra has reported 9 cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, in the Sindhudurg district. According to the state government's public health department, the KFD cases in Maharashtra [have been] reported [mainly] in the Sahyadri range.

According to the state entomologist, the cases are detected in the Western Ghat mainly due to the greater number of monkey population in that region. KFD is a zoonotic viral disease transmitted to human beings through the bite of infected ticks.

State entomologist Mahendra Jagtap said, "Shivamogga district in Karnataka is the hotspot of Kyasanur Forest Disease (monkey fever) due to cases being highly found in the Sahyadri range. Around 864 blood samples have been tested since January till date [20 Jul 2022]; so far, 9 cases of KFD have been detected." The state official also said that KFD, which is known as monkey fever, and monkeypox are 2 different diseases, and citizens should not get confused and panic. "KFD usually occurs in people living in the forest area. A new point-of-care testing lab has been set up by ICMR-NIV for rapid diagnosis of KFD," added Jagtap.

In 2021, 7 cases and one death were reported in the same region in Maharashtra. This indigenous disease first came to light in the Kyasanur Forest range of Soraba taluk in the Shivamogga district. The virus spreads when humans come in close contact with the carcass or faeces of an infected monkey. In humans, the virus is said to cause high fever, headaches, gastrointestinal bleeding, and vomiting, to name a few symptoms.

Dr Behram Pardiwala, director of internal medicines, Wockhardt Hospitals, said, "Monkey fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever. This occurs in the southern part of India. The virus belongs to the same family as the dengue virus. Monkeypox occurs when you have vesicles forming on the skin like smallpox lesions, which then dry out and form scabs. This is also a viral lesion but from a different family," added Dr Pardiwala.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family Flaviviridae.The illness is characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was first identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/transmission/index.html).

KFD typically occurs during the dry season, from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease.

The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants [trousers] to cover exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/exposure/index.html).

There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf).
