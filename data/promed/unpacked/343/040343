Anthrax has killed at least 7 people and affected 83 in Orissa's Koraput
district, health officials said on Monday. Experts from the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), New Delhi, and the Berhampur
Medical College Hospital visited the affected villages. "They have
confirmed 7 deaths since March 2003," district medical officer MR Sahu told
IANS over the telephone from Koraput.
"While one death was reported in April, 2 were reported in May, and the
remaining 4 in June, all in the Lamptaput block," he said. "The district
health department received at least 83 cases of suspected anthrax attack in
the district till Monday," he said. 2 more deaths due to suspected anthrax
were reported from Lamptaput Sunday, but there is no confirmation yet.
Anthrax usually affects cattle, and eating the meat of infected animals
passes on the disease to humans. Anthrax cases have been reported from the
Baipariguda and Lamptaput village blocks since March 2003.
"The bad food habits of tribal people caused the outbreak of the disease.
Many people in the area eat the meat of dead animals that is not always
well cooked," Sahu said. Many also eat rotten meat, he said. "We found
about 200 kg of infected meat of dead cattle during visits to villages and
burnt it," he said.
"Health workers have been positioned in most of the villages and we are
well equipped to check a further outbreak," he said. "We are requesting
people not to eat rotten meat."
The Lamptaput block headquarters has a missionary hospital called Asha
Kiran Hospital. Doctors there first claimed they received several anthrax
cases in the past months. This put district health officials on alert. The
veterinary department has administered 16 000 anthrax preventive vaccines
in the district this year.

[It is interesting that this is an ongoing problem that started in March
2003 and has continued unabated in Lamptaput in spite of the veterinary
department vaccinations and the claims of the alerted health service. The
statement that the villagers are eating "rotten meat" is a journalistic
distraction that implies that the villagers brought it all on themselves.
Yes, one should not eat meat from carcasses of animals that were sick or
dying, and especially when the cause of illness is anthrax. Unfortunately
it happens, and in many countries. The point is to protect stock from
readily preventable infectious diseases through structured proactive
vaccination schemes and restricting exposure. Butchering moribund animals
and dead stock is usually a good indicator of rural poverty. - Mod.MHJ]
