16 people, including 3 children, have been found infected with the
bacterium in Shahjadpur upazila in Sirajganj, a couple of weeks after
this year's [2011] 1st outbreak was reported in Sathia, Pabna. Local
health officials say the outbreak took place in Saratail village under
Kayempur union council of the upazila.

Resident physician of Shahjadpur Upazila Complex Dr Abdul Awal told
bdnews24.com that 16 people infected with anthrax were given treatment
at the hospital over the last 3 days.

A 3-member team of the livestock department rushed to the spot on
Friday [27 May 2011], bdnews24.com Sirajganj correspondent reports.

However, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology Disease
Control and Research (IEDCR) that oversees human infection urged
people not to panic, and instead to be aware of the disease. He said
doctors were better trained to manage anthrax infection. The infection
in skin is not life-threatening if detected early.

Prof Mahmudur Rahman strongly recommended "not to slaughter sick
cattle." He said the organism passes on to humans while handling sick
livestock, but person to person transmission does not occur.

Pabna, Sirajganj, Kushtia, Tangail, Meherpur, Manikganj, Satkhira,
Lalmonirhat, Rajshahi, Narayanganj, Laxmipur, and Chittagong are the
anthrax endemic districts. [Actually, these are just districts with
human cases. 15 districts were affected last year (2010) with human
and/or livestock cases. - Mod.MHJ]

Sirajganj Upazila livestock officer Altaf Hossain told bdnews24.com
that a cow was slaughtered in the village on 13 May 2011, and those
who processed the meat and consumed it got infected with anthrax. He
said cattle vaccination was underway in the district. Even a cheap
vaccine can keep animals immune from the bacterium.

Experts suggest coordination between human health and livestock
departments on a "one health approach" to stem such bacterial
zoonoses.

The IEDCR director says people should know how to dispose of dead
animals. They usually throw dead animals either into water bodies or
into open fields. "That helps the bacterium stay on the surface," said
Prof Rahman, and he urged all to bury dead animals after wrapping them
with plastic.

The government officially started reporting human infections of
anthrax in August 2009. The number of total infections was 610 before
the Sirajganj outbreak.

The bacterium can survive in harsh conditions for even centuries in
the soil. Cattle get infected while grazing during the rainy season
when water brings the bacterium to the surface, experts say.

[The district affected in this incident has clay soil, which normally
does not aid anthrax spore survival. We have yet to hear back from the
investigation by the joint IEDCR and ICDDR.B on the previous
caprine-based outbreak.

There is a severe problem of rural poverty in Bangladesh, which
results in livestock owners slaughtering moribund animals so that they
can recover something from the event; Muslims are forbidden from
eating meat from animals that had died, but it is permitted to
slaughter and butcher sick animals, thus the ongoing problems. Also,
there is frankly not enough livestock vaccine available to cover the
animals in all 15 affected districts, which should have been
vaccinated in March 2011, not retroactively now. - Mod.MHJ]

Eight more people have been found infected with anthrax at Shahjadpur
and Ullapara upazilas in Sirajganj, taking the toll to 24 in the
district.

On Friday [27 May 2011], 16 people, including 3 children, were found
anthrax-positive in Shahjadpur upazila, only weeks after this year's
[2011] 1st outbreak was reported in Sathia, Pabna. Resident physician
of Ullapara Upazila Health Complex Dr Sukumar Roy told bdnews24.com on
Saturday [28 May 2011] that the infected patients had been given
antibiotics. Of the infected patients, 5 are from Mohanpur union
council of Ullahpara Upazila and the other 3 from Kayempur union
council of Shahjadpur Upazila. They received treatment at Ullapara
Upazila Health Complex, as both Mohanpur and Kayempur are neighbouring
union councils. "A medical team is working to scrutinise whether there
are any more patients in the area," the physician added.

Sirajganj district livestock officer Shafiqul Islam told bdnews24.com
that a buffalo was slaughtered in the areas, and those who processed
and consumed the meat got infected with anthrax. "All the cattle of
the villages in the upazila are being vaccinated to avoid recurrence
of last year [2010]-like spread of the epidemic," the livestock
officer added.

Six more people have been diagnosed with anthrax in Shahjadpur and
Ullapara upazilas of Sirajganj, the district civil surgeon confirmed
on Sunday [29 May 2011].

The infected are one person of Chak Haripur village, one of Kuti
Satbaria village and 2 of Gugibari village in Shahjadpur upazila, and
2 of Mohanpur Nada village in Ullapara upazila. Three persons became
ill as they processed meat of sick cows a few days back, District
Civil Surgeon Dr Najimuddin Khan said. One was infected after he
slaughtered a sick goat and sold the meat among the locals recently,
reports our Sirajganj correspondent, quoting the civil surgeon. Thana
Health Officer Dr Abdul Awal of Shahjadpur confirmed that 2 were
infected after eating the meat of a sick goat.

The civil surgeon of the district said that medical teams went to the
villages of the upazilas and gave antibiotic treatment to the infected
people.

A total of 30 people have been detected with the disease in the 2
upazilas since Friday [27 May 2011].

[This is going to be as bad as 2010. The 610 figure quoted for 2010
ignores the cases that occurred earlier in that year. Members will
have noted that all these reports were initiated by secondary human
cases. The Bangladesh livestock service needs to get ahead of the
curve. - Mod.MHJ]
