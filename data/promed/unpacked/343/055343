The WHO Collaborating Centre for Arbovirus Reference and Research,
Queensland Health, has confirmed 21 cases of dengue 3 virus infection in
Cairns. Dengue 3 viral RNA was detected by PCR in sera from 16, and 5 cases
have been confirmed by detection of dengue 3 virus specific IgM.
Sequencing of the PCR product amplified directly from patient sera
suggested that the dengue 3 virus originated from SE Asia. The virus is
most closely related to a dengue 3 virus isolate obtained from a patient
who returned to Australia from Thailand in 1993.
Many of the confirmed cases resided at a waterfront hostel in late
November. Travellers on route to overseas or other Australian locations
frequent the hostel and may develop clinical symptoms after departure from
Cairns. Dengue should therefore be considered in any febrile patient with a
recent travel history to Cairns.

[Thanks very much to Debbie for the up-date and details regarding the
molecular epidemiology of this investigation. One small point: It is
difficult for me to accept that an IgM titer for dengue 3 virus is really
"specific" for that virus. The broad cross-reactivity of anti-flavivirus
IgM, particularly among the dengue viruses, suggests to me that perhaps
this antibody is reactive with dengue 3 virus but not necessarily specific
for that particular virus.
For those of you investigating the outbreak in Cairns, I suggest dinner at
"Charlie's". - Mod.CHC
