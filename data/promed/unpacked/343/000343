--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
In 2022, a 7-fold increase in the number of notifiable invasive _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (iGAS) infections among children aged 0-5 years was observed in the Netherlands compared with pre-COVID-19 pandemic years. Of 42 cases in this age group, 7 had preceding or coinciding varicella zoster infections, 9 were fatal. This increase is not attributable to a specific emm type. Vigilance for clinical deterioration as iGAS sign is warranted in young children, especially those with varicella zoster infection.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Increases in invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) infection and associated deaths, particularly in children, above seasonally expected levels are being seen this season (772 notifications reported in [epidemiological] weeks 37 to 48 in 2022) across England. Diagnoses of iGAS infection from lower respiratory tract specimens in children under 15 years increased to 28% in November 2022. Medical practitioners have been alerted to the exceptional increase in incidence, including unusual numbers of children presenting with pulmonary empyema.

[A discussion of GAS infections can be found in my moderator comments in ProMED post Streptococcus, gp A update (05): UK, fatal, scarlet fever, iGAS 20221231.8707549.

The following details have been extracted from the 2 full Eurosurveillances articles above, available at the source URLs:

In the Netherlands, 3 clinical presentations of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) are notifiable -- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), necrotizing fasciitis, and puerperal sepsis, but non-notifiable clinical presentations of iGAS, such as meningitis and bacteremia, were also documented in 2022, based on medical microbiology laboratory data.

STSS or necrotizing fasciitis were markedly increased in 2022 (n = 319 cases) compared with 4 pre-COVID-19 pandemic years 2016-19 (annual mean: 146) and after 2 pandemic years (2020-2021), with relatively few notifications (81 and 51, respectively). Of the 319 non-puerperal iGAS cases, 42 (13%) occurred in children aged 0-5 years. Between 2016 and 2019, the proportion of non-puerperal iGAS infections in children aged 0-5 years ranged between 2% and 7%. Cases of iGAS were geographically spread across the Netherlands.

emm types 1, 4, 12, 22 and 89 made up >80% of the pathogenic isolates, both for all ages (899/1083) and for children aged 0-5 years (173/177). Compared with 2019, the contribution of emm4 increased from 6% to 20% in children aged 0-5 years in 2022.

A survey by Dutch pediatricians found 16 varicella zoster infections and 9 influenza infections occurred among 49 pediatric iGAS cases between July 2021 and June 2022, highlighting the role of preceding viral infection in the risk of iGAS.

Similar to the Netherlands, England is also experiencing a surge of pediatric iGAS infections; of a total of 772 iGAS infections reported between 11 Sep and 27 Nov 2022, 26.2% (202/772) were diagnosed in children younger than 15 years, compared with a range of 6.4-13.3% in the previous seasons. A total of 14 deaths of all 61 iGAS deaths in all age groups occurred in children younger than 15 years during this period. The case fatality rate (CFR) in 2022 for all age groups were similar to CFR in past years. Cases were regionally dispersed with increases seen across England.

Increased reports of iGAS cases in children younger than 15 years of age with respiratory virus co-infections were noted in October and November 2022, similar to past years. The most frequently identified co-infecting respiratory viral species were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (12.4% of iGAS cases in November 2022), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) (11.3%) and rhinovirus (7.2%), in line with increasing numbers of RSV and rhinovirus infections in England since September 2022.

In children  younger than 15 years of age, emm1 was the main (57%) circulating emm type, followed by emm12 (23%) and emm4 (7%). emm type 1 was identified in 9 of the 13 child deaths. Whole genome sequencing of all typed invasive and non-invasive isolates indicates that there has been no obvious expansion of a single clone for those emm types; however, the majority of the emm1 isolates were part of the emm1 M1UK clone, first detected in 2010, for which there is upregulation of SpeA expression, a virulence factor of _Streptococcus pyogenes_. - Mod.ML
