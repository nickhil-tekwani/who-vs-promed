Update on Yellow Fever in Colombia
------------------------------------------
Following the 2 epidemic peaks occurring on the Colombian-Venezuelan border
in 2003 during January and July [see ProMED refs. below. ­ Mod.JW], which
affected the states of Zulia, Norte de Santander, and Cesar, authorities
began to detect in December 2003 some new cases of yellow fever originating
the region of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, departments of Cesar,
Magdalena, and La Guajira. This new outbreak brought the total number of
cases to 28 with 11 deaths, bringing the fatality rate to 39 percent. The
1st cases of this new outbreak were reported during epidemiological week
(EW) 51 [2003]. The highest incidence for this outbreak was during EW 1
(2004), with the last case reported during EW 2. The municipalities most
affected were Santa Marta (with 14 cases), Valledupar (7), and Dibulla (5).

By 16 Feb 2004, the Virology and Pathology Laboratories of the National
Institute of Health (Instituto Nacional de Salud/INS) had received a total
of 850 samples from suspected human cases, of which 28 were positive for
yellow fever; 5 by immunohistochemistry; and the rest by IgM antibodies
[the presence of IgM antibody usually indicates recent infection. ­ Mod.JW].

The broad dissemination and high density of _Aedes aegypti_, linked to the
increase of human traffic back and forth within the region, brings with it
the risk of yellow fever being reintroduced into the urban centers of the
Americas. The prevention of jungle yellow fever is only possible by means
of vaccination. In the urban form of the disease, prevention is also
possible through the implementation of vector-control measures in addition
to vaccine use.

Following the outbreaks in Colombia in 2003 and early 2004, there has been
a strengthening of epidemiological surveillance and laboratory diagnosis,
with diagnostic training workshops being held and new sentinel centers
opened. As a preventive measure to avoid reemergence of the urban form of
the disease, there has been a strengthening of vector-control measures in
the affected municipalities.

There is a need to maintain these actions and their sustainability and to
continue to incorporate PAHO recommendations into activities to prevent and
control JYF and to deter its possible re-urbanization.
