Information received on [and dated] 29 May 2013 from Dr Keren Bar-Yaacov, chief veterinary officer, Legislation, Norwegian Food Safety Authority, Brumunddal, Norway

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 28 May 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 28 May 2013
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: July 2010 [Troms]
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: infectious salmon anaemia [ISA] virus
Nature of diagnosis: suspicion, clinical, laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1 (2013/3) 30117, Skjervoy, Nord Troms
Date of start of the outbreak: 28 May 2013
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals: Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_)

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected
Species / Morbidity* / Mortality* / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Atlantic salmon / 3* / 3* / 1 224 100 / 100 000 / 50 000 / 138 500 / 0
* scale 0 to 5

Outbreak statistics [rates are "apparent" and expressed as percentages]
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost**
Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) / 8.17 / 4.08 / 50.00 / 15.40

**Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The epidemiological survey has just started. The genotype of the ISA virus has not yet been identified. Associated with the epidemiological studies, the virus will be further characterized by the sequencing of segment 5 and 6 of the genome.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, emergency harvest, official destruction of clinically diseased aquatic animals, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.
No vaccination
No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: zoning, tracing forward, tracing back, surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone, surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Norwegian Veterinary Institute (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Atlantic salmon / histopathology / 28 May 2013 / Positive
Atlantic salmon / immunohistochemical test / 28 May 2013 / Positive
Atlantic salmon / real-time PCR / 28 May 2013 / Positive

[The location of the outbreak described, in northern Norway, can be seen on the map available at the source URL above.

A previous outbreak of infectious salmon anemia (ISA) in Troms was reported in July 2010. An additional immediate notification of an ISA outbreak has been submitted by Norway to the OIE today, Thu 30 May 2013. Its location is Nordland (32957, Sandnessjoen, Helgeland). The report is available, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13520 and includes the following epidemiological comments:

"From an epidemiological point of view, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) considers the ISA outbreak in Sandnessjoen a 1st occurrence in this geographical area. Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) was already present in Nordland in February and April 2013. However, at that time the disease did not affect the same area in which this notified outbreak has occurred. Therefore the NFSA assumes the currently reported outbreak is not a reoccurrence of ISA disease. The previous occurrences of ISA outbreaks took place in a quite different area within Nordland, with a distance of more than 250 km (155 mi) from other ISA-outbreaks. The ISA cases are separate outbreaks without any epidemiological correlation, although the previous occurrences of the disease belong to the same administrative region, Nordland, which is an extensive region."

These epidemiological comments are also applicable, with the relevant modifications, for the immediate notification of 29 May 2013 addressing the ISA outbreak in Troms. ISA, an OIE reportable disease, is an orthomyxovirus infection of sea-farmed Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_), which induces a systemic and lethal condition characterized by severe anemia and variable hemorrhages and necrosis in several organs. The disease course is prolonged with low daily mortality (0.05-0.1 per cent), typically only in a few cages, but cumulative mortality may become very high. Initially reported in Norway in the mid-1980s, ISA in Atlantic salmon has since then been reported in Canada (New Brunswick in 1996 and Nova Scotia in 2000), the United Kingdom (Scotland in 1998), the Faroe Islands (2000, report to OIE), USA (Maine in 2001), and Chile (2002-2007). The virus has been reported from rainbow trout in Ireland in 2002 and from Coho salmon in Chile (2004). The above and additional information on ISA are available in chapter 2.3.5 of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2012 at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.05_ISA_2009%20.pdf. - Mod.AS
