CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Indian Health Service, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
investigate an ongoing multi-state outbreak of human _Salmonella
[enterica_] serotype Saintpaul infections. An epidemiologic
investigation comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons has
identified consumption of raw tomatoes as the likely source of the
illnesses. The specific type and source of tomatoes is under
investigation; however, the data suggest that illnesses are linked to
consumption of raw red plum, red Roma, or round red tomatoes, or any
combination of these types of tomatoes, and to products containing
these raw tomatoes.

Since April 2008, 277 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with the
same genetic fingerprint have been identified in 28 states and the
District of Columbia: Arkansas (2 persons), Arizona (19), California
(6), Colorado (1), Connecticut (2), Florida (1), Georgia (7), Idaho
(3), Illinois (34), Indiana (7), Kansas (8), Kentucky (1), Maryland
(1), Michigan (2), Missouri (4), New Mexico (68), New York (2), North
Carolina (1), Ohio (3), Oklahoma (4), Oregon (3), Tennessee (4),
Texas (68), Utah (2), Virginia (16), Vermont (1), Washington (1),
Wisconsin (5), and the District of Columbia (1). These were
identified because clinical laboratories in all states send strains
from ill persons with salmonellosis to their State public health
laboratory for characterization. Among the 202 persons with
information available, illnesses began between 10 Apr 2008 and 5 Jun
2008. Patients range in age from less than one to 88 years; 46
percent are female. At least 43 persons were hospitalized. No deaths
have been officially attributed to this outbreak. However, a man in
his 60s who died in Texas from cancer had an infection with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Saintpaul at the time of his death. The
infection may have contributed to his death.

Only 3 persons infected with this strain of _S._ Saintpaul were
identified in the country during the same period in 2007. The
previous rarity of this strain and the distribution of illnesses in
all USA regions suggest that the implicated tomatoes are distributed
throughout much of the country. Because of inherent delays in
reporting and because many persons with salmonellosis do not have a
stool specimen tested, it is likely many more illnesses have occurred
than those reported. Some of these unreported illnesses may be in
states that are not on today's map [for map, see original URL - Mod.LL].

[Since the last posting related to this outbreak on 13 Jun 2008,
there have been 49 new cases linked to the specific DNA fingerprint
and 5 new states (Arkansas, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, and
Ohio) plus the District of Columbia involved. The 2nd posting below
supplies some clues being followed to try to identify the source of
the _S._ Saintpaul. - Mod.LL]

The salmonella outbreak associated with tainted tomatoes has expanded
to 5 more states and the District of Columbia, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Monday [16 Jun 2008].

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet identified the
source of the contamination, an agency official said. The agency is
focusing its efforts on Mexico and central and southern Florida, but
it has yet to trace the genetic fingerprint to a farm or plant.

The most solid lead in the investigation is a cluster of 9 people who
became sick after eating tomatoes from the same company, said the
official, Dr David Acheson. He did not say where the company was
located or whether it was a grocery store or a restaurant. On Friday
[13 Jun 2008], a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Public
Health said the state was helping to investigate a cluster of 9 cases
of salmonella poisoning in Chicago. Dr Ian Williams of the CDC said
the outbreak was "ongoing."
