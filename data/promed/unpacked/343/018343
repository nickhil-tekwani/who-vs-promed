The Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MOFA) is to draw up a 5 year programme to help curb the perennial outbreak of anthrax. The Northern and Upper East Regions are noted as endemic areas. The sector minister, Clement Kofi Humado [minister for food and agriculture], made this known when he visited the Upper East Region to assess the trend of the recent outbreak of the disease.

He said the ministry would issue a white paper to cabinet for consideration to kick start the programme. The programme will be concentrated on the endemic areas before it spread to other areas. Mr Humado said anthrax does not only lead to the deaths of animals but human beings as well when the infection is not tackled with urgency.

At a round table held at Bolgatanga, Bongo and Bongo-Soe with MOFA directors, veterinary officers, and animal production personnel, it came to light that one of the factors that militate against the control of the disease is the lukewarm attitude of livestock farmers to avail their animals for vaccination. The unwillingness of the farmers to pay between GH 1.00 and 50 pesewas [USD 0.25-0.50] per an animal was identified as one of the major challenges.

Other challenges include inadequate [numbers of] veterinary officers and lack of logistics.

The sector minister appealed to the Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) and Ghana Health Service to help MOFA deal with the problem. He also entreated the MMDAs to enact bylaws and strictly enforce them to ensure that livestock farmers allow their animals to be vaccinated.

[To add numbers to this worthy intention, in 2005, there were 11 bovine outbreaks in the Northern Province (NO) and one in Upper East (UE); 2006, 4 (NO), 2 (UE); 2007, 2 (UE); 2008, 2 (NO), 2 (UE); 2009, one (UE); 2010, 2 (NO); 2011, 6 (NO). Not infrequently, these all involved sheep and the occasional pig, as well as humans with deaths.

The constraints on a cost effective control programme are, unfortunately, worldwide; not enough veterinary feet on the ground and farmer reluctance to cover the costs of their stocks' vaccination. What we have found to better this situation is 1st to construct an ecological niche model using GPS locations of past outbreaks. This can be done to a one sq. km precision. These models say where the disease might occur, not where they will occur. This provides an easily understood basis for surveillance -- that is, a map, and everyone thinks that they can read a map, and the map locates where each farm is in regard to this risk (in or out) -- for farmer awareness, and specifically to report any and all unexpected livestock deaths. Depending on the confidence in the locations of known outbreaks, annual vaccination is targeted on all farms within a 10-15 km radius of known outbreaks. In our experience it is not unusual to have a neighbour with dead cattle watching silently while the index outbreak is being cleaned up. So for at least the next 3 years, do this wide annual vaccination "centred" on known cases. Depending on what then happens, one can continue for another 2 or more years, or contract down to the index farm +/- his immediate neighbours. While spores can survive in the soil for a number of years, the reality is that they do die off, and one wants the livestock to be protected while at risk of getting infected.

Obviously where the soil contamination is severe, outbreaks will reoccur when vaccination is stopped -- that is, they are self-declaring -- and in these few places, a longer programme is needed. But they are few.

Anyone needing details on the niche modeling should get in touch with me, and I can then pass them on to the modeling experts. We have done it in many parts of the world with success. An additional benefit is when an outbreak occurs outside the risk area, either the model needs to be rerun, but equally importantly, it is an epidemiologic indicator that the risk was imported -- for example, in purchased contaminated hay or forage, or in a commercial feed or bone meals. A farm visit will sort that out, and the control programme can be adjusted accordingly.
