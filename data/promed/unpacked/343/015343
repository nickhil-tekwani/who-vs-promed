Meat industry pushes irradiation - CURT ANDERSON, AP Farm Writer
As the Clinton administration pushes for mandatory recalls and tougher
penalties in contaminated meat cases, the industry is promoting an
alternative that kills dangerous bacteria: irradiation. Fearing the
economic fallout of more highly publicized recalls, the meat industry is
trying to persuade the Food and Drug Administration to approve irradiation
for beef and is lobbying Congress to allow smaller, less ominous
irradiation labels for all foods. "We need to make this food safety tool
available for the public," said Rhona Applebaum, executive vice president
for scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Food Processors
Association.
Irradiation -- exposing food to low levels of radiation -- is already
permitted for poultry, pork, fruits and vegetables, but is not in
widespread use for several reasons: consumer wariness, expense and
opposition by consumer groups that question its safety. This summer's
recall of 25 million pounds of Hudson Foods Inc. ground beef has focused
new attention on meat safety and how to guard against illnesses caused by
such foodborne bacteria as E. coli and salmonella. Tainted meat was in the
news again last week with the recall of nearly 444,000 pounds of ground
beef processed at a Nebraska plant and South Korea's detection of E. coli
on beef supplied by another Nebraska meatpacker. The Senate Agriculture
Committee has scheduled a hearing Wednesday to discuss food safety and the
potential of new technology such as irradiation.
[CDPC Note: Irradiation will be a large step in making beef safer, but it
should be instituted in addition to more stringent inspection and other
food safety guidelines.
