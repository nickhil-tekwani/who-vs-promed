Confusion of association with cause
-------------------------------------
In the ProMED-mail post on "Adenovirus type 36 and Obesity", Dhurandhar and
his colleagues were quoted as stating that they had picked adenovirus type
36 simply because little is known about it and the strain is relatively
easy to work with. I also, like the moderator, find this reason curious.
With the number of viruses and other variables involved, I also find it
premature to say anything about "cause" and the variable being "at the
heart of obesity". They seem to confuse association with cause. It is
therefore unrealistic to speculate what to do about this "cause" of
obesity. It may have been the reporter that put words in the authors'
mouths, but just a touch of scientific method and sensible handling of the
"results" would be welcome.
