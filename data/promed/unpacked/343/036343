In the capital of Kyrgyzstan 79 cases of malaria have been
registered; 60 from Bishkek and 19 from the Chuysk region. Despite
preventive measures, the outbreak is growing. This information was
provided by the deputy chief of the state sanitary epidemiological
surveillance (SES) center in Bishkek, Adilbek Djuzenov.
According to Adilbek Djuzenov, it requires several years of
preventive work to destroy a malaria focus. Kyrgyzstan registered 125
malaria cases in 2005, of whom most were inhabitants of Ak-Bata and
Kalis Ordo villages of Bishkek. The epicenter of the spread is the
Ala-Archinsk reservoir in the Chuysk region.
According to Djuzenov, 819 households at Ak-Bata and Kalis ordo have
been sprayed with insecticides. However, it is challenging for the
population to understand the problem, and [only] sometimes do people
allow the SES staff to spray their houses.
According to Adilbek Djuzenov, the disease can be treated with
Primosin [ProMED does not know what drug is being referred to under
this brand name], and enough drugs were delivered by humanitarian aid.

[ProMED reported 88 cases of malaria in Bishkek in 2005. We still do
not have a species identification. Malaria was eradicated in
Kyrgyzstan in 1959; however, from 1986 onwards, as a result of the
importation of malaria by military personnel returning from
Afghanistan, a few local cases have been registered annually. In 1986
and 1987, 14 and 10 autochthonous malaria cases were detected,
respectively. In 1988, 21 cases due to local transmission were
registered. In 2002, a total of 2267 autochthonous _P. vivax_ cases
were reported in the southwestern regions of the country, including
Batken, Osh and Jalal-Abad.
The explosive resumption of malaria transmission in Kyrgyzstan was
the result of immigration of a number of infected people from
Tajikistan into the Batken region. In 2004-2005, there was a
significant decrease in the reported number of autochthonous malaria
cases (42 in 2005). However, in 2004 the first autochthonous case of
_P. falciparum_ malaria was reported in the Aravan district of the
southern part of Kyrgyzstan, in an area bordering Uzbekistan, and in
2005 the number of autochthonous cases of _P. vivax_ malaria
increased in the outskirts of Bishkek, the capital of the country
(Source:

ProMED reported 88 cases of malaria from Kyrgyzstan in 2005 in
contrast to the 42 the country reported theough WHO. This indicates
that there may be some underreporting of cases. - Mod.EP]
[Bishkek is the capital of Kyrgyzstan and its population is 768 000.
The Chuysk region borders Bishkek and has 765 700 people. - Mod.NR]
