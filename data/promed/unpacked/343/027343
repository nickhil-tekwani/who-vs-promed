Agriculture ministry calls for swift action on blue-ear disease
---------------------------------------------------------------
Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Diep Kinh Tan has requested provinces plagued by blue-ear disease to take stronger action to stop the spread of the disease.

Speaking at a regular meeting of the National Steering Committee on Bird Flu Prevention and Control in Ha Noi yesterday [12 Jun 2012], Tan asked the localities to strengthen farm inspections, destroy dead or sick pigs, decontaminate affected areas, and put a temporary stop to the transportation of pork from these places to prevent further spread of the disease.

He also ordered localities to have their pigs vaccinated.

Hoang Van Nam, head of the ministry's Animal Health Department, said the disease this year had been erratic in occurrence. It normally only occurred in the Hong (Red) River Delta, but this year broke out in northern mountainous provinces before spreading to the delta. The disease was 1st detected in the northern mountainous province of Lao Cai on 11 Jan 2012 and has since spread to 123 communes nationwide, ravaging 34 000 pigs -- 21 700 of which had to be destroyed.

One common characteristic of the outbreak was that the disease had spread widely over a short period of time, reflecting the late detection of the disease and slow response of local leaders and farmers in the early stages of the outbreak, Nam said.

[Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was 1st recognised in 1987 in the USA, and within a few years it became a pandemic. Soon after the discovery of the virus (1991), later classified as a member of the order Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, genus Arterivirush, it became apparent the North American (NA, type 2) and European (EU, type 1) PRRSV isolates represented 2 genotypes with antigenic differences.

PRRS is recognised by late-gestation abortions and early or delayed farrowings that contain dead and mummified fetuses, stillborn pigs, and weak-born pigs. An increase in repeat breeders during the acute phase of the epizootic is commonly reported. In boars and unbred replacement gilts and sows, transient fever and anorexia may be observed. The respiratory syndrome is recognised by dyspnoea (thumping), fever, anorexia, and listlessness. Younger pigs are more affected than older animals with boars and sows (unbred) frequently having subclinical infection. An increase in secondary infections is common and mortality can be high. In PRRSV-infected boars and boars that have been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine, PRRSV can be shed in semen, and changes in sperm morphology and function have been described. The virus is primarily transmitted directly via infected pigs and also by faeces, urine and semen. It can also be spread indirectly, presumably via aerosol routes, leading to chronic re-infection of herds in swine dense areas, and possibly by mechanical vectors.

Most PRRSV isolates from South America and much of Asia are of type 2. It is assumed these viruses were introduced through the movement of swine and/or semen. A reportedly highly virulent strain of type 2 virus in Southeast Asia is characterised by a discontinuous 30 amino acid deletion in the NSP2 region of the genome. Differences in virulence between PRRSV isolates within a genotype and between genotypes are believed to exist based on field observations and some experimental studies. This variability has been reinforced with the emergence in 2006 of a PRRSV lineage in South-East Asia associated with porcine high fever disease, a syndrome initially described in China and subsequently in Viet Nam and other countries in the region. It acquired also the name "blue ear disease," causing high mortality in all ages of swine. Although there is an extensive body of research completed since the discovery of PRRSV, there are still many gaps in the knowledge base about the apparent link between PRRSV and other diseases as well as understanding the PRRSV immune response. The disease is OIE-notifiable.

Vaccines can be of value as an aid in the prevention of reproductive and respiratory forms of PRRS. Modified live vaccines are not suitable for use in pregnant sows and gilts and in boars. Vaccination may result in shedding of vaccinal virus in semen.

Modified live virus vaccines can persist in vaccinated animals, and transmission to nonvaccinated animals and subsequent vaccine-virus-induced disease have been reported.

The above and additional information, including data on vaccine production techniques and testing requirements, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.08.07_PRRS.pdf.

According to Viet Nam's annual report to the OIE, during 2011 there have been 215 recorded outbreaks of PRRS, causing 42 501 clinical cases of which 7658 died and 23 882 had to be destroyed. "Ring vaccinations" were applied in 18 300 animals. - Mod.AS
