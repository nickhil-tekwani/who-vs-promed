Subject: Ae. albopictus and Dirofilaria
Can any one tell me of the current consensus as to whether albopictus is
considered to be an important vector of Dirofilaria, especially in cats?
An article in our paper claimed the rate of cat heartworm has increased
dramatically since 1986, and the source for the article claims it is because
albopictus is such a good vector. He asserted that it is larger than
resident species (which is totally absurd), more aggressive (which is not
correct either) and said that studies indicated that it can harbor more
infective stage larvae than other mosquitoes.
This person cited someone finding 5 to 7 infective larvae associated with
the proboscis of albopictus females and only 3 to 4 in other species. In my
experience, for a really good vector, 5 to 7 is a low number of infective
larvae, but I have never worked with Dirofilaria.
Before I tell people this guy is totally wrong, I would like a little
factual support.

[With the ever increasing popularity of domestic cats, it was only a matter
of time before more clinicians started finding them with dirofilariasis. The
domestic cat has always been susceptible. MHJ]
