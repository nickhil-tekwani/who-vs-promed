GIARDIA AND CRYPTOSPORIDIUM IN SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES
_Giardia intestinalis_ (_Giardia lamblia_) and _Cryptosporidum parvum_ are
two protozoans which have great importance as waterborne pathogens around
the world. The form of distribution for giardia are cysts and for
cryptosporidium oocysts which survives for a long time in water. They are
resistant to disinfection and have a low infection dose.
The causes of waterborne outbreaks of giardia and cryptosporidium has often
been insufficient treated surface water or ground water which have been
affected by surface water. Oocysts which are smaller than cysts can,
because of its small size, sometimes pass through the filters of the water
treatment plants.
Samples from untreated water from 26 different surface water treatment
plants and samples of drinking water were analysed. The samplings were
carried out in 1996 and 1997.
Giardia and/or cryptosporidium were found in 38 % (19 of 50) of the
investigated untreated water. The frequency for cryptosporidium was higher
during spring of 1997 (40 %) than autumn of 1996 (24 %). The content in
samples from untreated water varied between 9 - 460 per 100 liter for
giardia and 12 - 460 per 100 liter for cryptosporidium. The occurrence of
giardia and cryptosporidium were higher in areas affected by waste water.
The indicator organisms which are used in the public control of water do
not tell us anything about the occurrence of parasitic protozoa because the
survival of the coliforms are shorter and more sensitive to disinfection
than (oo)cysts. Back flushing of the filter can be a hazardous factor then
large amount of (oo)cysts can be released and brought back to the drinking
water.
The authorities in Sweden worked out following recommendations:
1. A deeper mapping directed towards larger surface water treatment plants
(> 4,000 people connected) and surface water treatment plants without slow
working filter.
2. Optimization of the treatment at the plants if (oo)cysts) have been found.
3. Contacts between authorities at local and national level.
4. Information.
