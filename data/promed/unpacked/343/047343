Pomegranate production, exports hit by blight
---------------------------------------------
Pomegranate production in the state and its exports to Europe have
consistently gone down during the last 2 years due to the incidence of
a disease called bacterial blight [oily spot].

About 60-70 per cent of the country's pomegranate exports are from
Maharashtra. The state produced a total of 596 000 metric tonnes in
2007-08 and 555 000 metric tonnes in 2009-2010. This decrease is
despite the fact that the area under cultivation went up during the
period. Acute shortage of good quality fruit due to the incidence of
bacterial blight has increased the prices in domestic and export
markets.

The National Research Centre on Pomegranates (NRCP) was founded in
2005 to guide growers in face of the large scale occurrence of
bacterial blight in Maharashtra. According to NRCP, here has been
heavy incidence of this disease since 2005. They had introduced a
comprehensive package for control using sprays and crop sanitation,
which involves burning infected plants.

However, the Pomegranate Growers Association said that the package
was of little help at the farm level. Production has fallen by about
80 per cent during the last 3 years and 30 000 hectares [about 74 000
acres] of pomegranate have been uprooted. The fruit is now of bad
quality as crops are exposed to excess sunlight.

[Oily spot of pomegranate (also called bacterial blight, black spot)
is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar
_punicae_. The main damage occurs on fruits which develop black spots
and usually split resulting in enormous yield losses. Disease
development and spread are favoured by cloudy weather and intermittent
rainfall, and heavy rains are thought to be a triggering factor for
epidemics.

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit
and cuttings), mechanical means (including insect and human
activities), and wind-splashed rain. Disease management includes use
of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures, and bactericidal
sprays containing antibiotics or copper. However, the latter may lead
to rejection of exported fruit by some countries. No commercial
pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily
spot.

The disease has become an increasingly serious problem for Indian
pomegranate growers of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra (ProMED-mail post 20071123.3789) and Karnataka (ProMED-mail post 20091120.3993). In
Maharashtra, oily spot was found to be the main disease of the crop in
2006/2007 with 100 per cent infection in some orchards.

Another strain of the same species, _X. axonopodis_ pv. _citri_,
causes citrus canker, which poses a serious threat to citrus
industries worldwide.
