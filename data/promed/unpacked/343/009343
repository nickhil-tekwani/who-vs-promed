In an interview with Swazi TV on Monday [10 Sep 2012], many residents said their cows had been dying in the past few days, but they had no idea what was killing them. The Mbelebeleni area in the Manzini region was one of the affected areas where the mystery disease killed about 25 cows.

Minister Clement Dlamini confirmed yesterday [11 Sep 2012] that a mysterious disease was killing cows nationwide. The ministry was currently not in a position to state what kind of disease was killing the cattle. He said the ministry was currently engaged in investigations following many reports that have been received.

He said the ministry had since conducted a postmortem of the dead animals, after which a report would be compiled, and thereafter advice would be given to cattle owners as to what to do next.

Dlamini said that for now, the facts would be known only after the postmortem report had been finalised. He said all regions of the country had been affected.
