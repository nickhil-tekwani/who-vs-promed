Have any checks been made to see if any of the athletes participating in
these events participated in both? Perhaps one of the participants in the
earlier event was infected; and if any of the athletes participated in both
competitions they could have carried the organism to the other event.
Something like this seems to be a likely source of transmission.

Something to keep in mind is the possibility that an infected athlete
participating in both events could contaminate the lakes, exposing the
swimmers that follow to infection. It is not unusual for athletes to
urinate "on the run" so as not to lose time in the race.
This assumes the serogroups in the two outbreaks are the same. Analysis of
athletes who competed in both events as well as the attack rate by finish
order in the swimming portion of the competition may shed light on this
investigation.

[Obviously great minds think alike. However, until we know which serovars
are involved there is slight basis for any speculation. It would help if
anyone in-the-know about these incidents would share their information with
us. Have there been similar outbreaks elsewhere in runners? Have there been
any psychiatric sequelae as noted earlier in ProMED-mail. - Mod.MHJ
