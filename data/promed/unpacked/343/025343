2 die in separate Legionnaires' outbreaks
-----------------------------------------
2 elderly men have died following 2 outbreaks of the bacterial infection
Legionnaire's disease. On Tue, 31 Aug 2004, it was reported that there are
now 9 confirmed cases with 2 more suspected in Lidkoping, with 1 death,
while another outbreak in Jul 2004 has come to light in Umea, where 3
people fell ill and an elderly man died.
The outbreak earlier this summer has been linked to an old spraying system
at the OBS Supermarket in Umea that is used to keep fruit and vegetables
moist. The store was temporarily closed.
Over the past years public health authorities have been researching
different potential sources of legionella infection, and claim they have
checked some 40 different vegetable spraying units in supermarkets, without
ever finding any trace of the bacteria behind the disease. Despite this,
the board of the Svensk Dagligvaruhandel, a branch organisation for fresh
produce retailers in Sweden, has advised its members to turn off all water
spraying units in their stores.
"There isn't an actual reason to do so, but it is the only way to stop all
the discussion and concern that has spread amongst our clients," commented
Thomas Svaton, head of the industry organisation Svensk Dagligvaruhandel,
to the Swedish media.
"There aren't that many units anyway, since many stores don't see the need
for this additional moisturising system, but those that are in operation
should be closed until we have better guidelines on cleaning and maintenance."
The cause of the Lidkoping outbreak is still not clear, but all supermarket
spraying systems are being checked. Attention has also turned to the town's
public air-conditioning systems.
"We know from outbreaks abroad that air-conditioning systems are a common
infection source," commented Martin Wahl from SMI's West Gotaland division
to Dagens Nyheter. "There are many cases in which people have been infected
by aerosol from cooling towers on industrial sites, and there are 3 such
sites in Lidkoping."

[As was seen in the original outbreak, like other causes of pneumonia,
legionellosis has a higher morbidity and mortality in the elderly. As an
intracellular pathogen, legionella tend to cause more significant disease
in individuals with compromised cellular immunity. - Mod.LL]
