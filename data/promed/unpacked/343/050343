California animal health officials have confirmed a new case of equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in a horse in Inyo County. They say this case is unrelated to the multiple cases confirmed in Los Angeles County over the past few weeks.

In Los Angeles, the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said on [2 Dec. 2016], 13 horses have tested positive for the non-neuropathogenic strain of the virus at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center. "There have been no new febrile horses since 23 Nov 2016 and only 1 positive horse remains in isolation," the CDFA said in a statement. "Enhanced biosecurity measures continue in all barns under quarantine and all horses' temperatures continue to be monitored twice daily." In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

Also on [2 Dec. 2016], the CDFA reported the new case in Inyo County. "A different strain of EHV-1 causing EHM (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy) has been confirmed in 1 horse with mild neurologic symptoms in Inyo County," the agency reported. "This is the neurologic strain, which is biologically distinct from the non-neurologic strain identified in all the Los Angeles County confirmed cases.

"The affected horse, a 20-year-old Quarter Horse gelding, is part of a wintering pack string of 28 horses and 4 mules on an isolated, high desert ranch," the statement continues. "These horses and mules have been placed under quarantine with no movement allowed in order to limit disease transmission. This disease outbreak is under investigation by CDFA staff onsite and CDFA will continue to provide updated information."

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
