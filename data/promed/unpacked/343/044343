Equestrian centres, riding clubs and horse yards across North Wales have gone into lockdown as fears mounts over a major outbreak of strangles. In recent weeks cases have been reported across the region, from Wrexham to Anglesey, prompting scores of equine businesses to close their gates.

A flurry of shows, clinics and competitions have been cancelled amid pleas for "irresponsible" owners to stop travelling with sick horses.
The main focus is in north east Wales, between Holywell and Prestatyn, where all major equestrian centres and riding clubs have been advised by their vets to shut down. Many livery yards in the region have also stopped taking in new horses.

Horse vet Richard Owen, of RD Owen Equine Clinic, St Asaph, has been encouraging yards to act now to get on top of the disease. He said: "It is a contact disease, so with adequate hygiene procedures we should be able to control it. My advice to equestrian centres is to close down for at least 2 weeks -- the incubation period -- and ideally for 3 weeks. The current outbreak started in January [2016] in one yard before spreading to other places because control measures were perhaps not being taken seriously enough. However I hope that if we now sacrifice 2 or 3 weeks, we can still have an enjoyable summer. If we don't, there's a danger it will continue for the next few weeks and months."

The 1st to shut, 10 days ago, was Marian Bach Equestrian Centre, Babell. Owner Rose Brooke is not taking any chances and the centre will stay shut for 6 weeks. She said: "It's a horrid disease and I don't want it here. "We've got disinfectant everywhere, with buckets of Jeyes Fluid across the yard, and we've cancelled 5 days of shows and competitions in April [2016]. It's lost business but I don't care about that, I just want all our horses to be healthy. At the end of April we have a lady coming over from Holland to give a clinic, so I'm just hoping the disease will be clear by then. Last week one of our horses died from old age, aged 31, so I've been in tears over that. With this outbreak as well, it's been a pretty miserable time."

Both Mynydd Delyn and Lloc Riding Clubs have suspended competitions amid calls for the start of the season to be postponed in north east Wales. Mynydd Delyn has called off its 1st show on 24 Apr 2016 and Lloc has cancelled its season opener on 3 Apr 2016. The decisions were taken amid concern that too many riders are taking their horses to events despite displaying symptoms of strangles. On its Facebook page, Lloc RC said: "Can we please ask people to not to travel off yards with strangles or suspected strangles as if we do not contain it now there may be no shows to attend in 2016."

On Wednesday [30 Mar 2016] Coleg Cambria announced its Northop Equine Centre would be closing to horses and the public for at least 4 weeks, after which the situation will be reviewed. All competitions and clinics have been cancelled but students will still be able to attend the college, with precautions. The Flint & Denbigh Hunt Pony Club has also posted a website message to say it has cancelled all mounted rallies and training events for the next 2 weeks. Un-mounted activities will continue but all members are being told to wear clean footwear and clothing. Pony Club District Commissioner Bethan Jones said: "Our vet advised us that while none of our ponies are affected, we should cancel mounted activities as a precaution."

No cases have been reported at Maelor Equestrian Centre at Hope, near Wrexham, but it closed its gates on Tuesday [29 Mar 2016]. The centre has cancelled all activities, including shows and training until 17 Apr 2016 at the earliest. The decision was not taken lightly but the action was needed to prevent Maelor's horses becoming infected, said Annie Lloyd, who helps her parents run the yard. "Strangles is always in the background but we took advice from our vets who said levels of the disease were currently pretty high in the area," she said. "We wanted to protect our own horses as well as those of our clients. We were one of the 1st to shut and I think others have since followed suit. Yards can be reluctant to be the 1st to shut but once the bigger names start closing, others don't want to be seen as being irresponsible."
