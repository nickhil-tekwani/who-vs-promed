Thousands of butterflies die on the East Line Highway in Hainan
---------------------------------------------------
Tens of thousands of beautiful butterflies have died and been
scattered along the East Line Highway. This was personally seen by
the reporters Liu Wei and Li Zhi yesterday morning [29 Jun 2005]. The
cause of death of the butterflies has yet to be authoritatively
explained.

On 29 Jun 2005 at 11:00 a.m., the reporters drove along the East Line
Highway towards Qionghai. From kilometer 8, the colorful dead
butterflies were scattered along the road and began to attract
attention. At first, the reporters believed that the butterflies had
hit car windshields and died. But further down the road, there were
more dead butterflies. By kilometer 12 the dead butterflies could
already be described as numerous. At kilometer 12, the reporters got
out of the car for a closer inspection. Every one or 2 meters along
the shoulder of the road there were one or 2 dead butterflies. In
some places they were relatively more concentrated, and some off-road
sites had about 10 butterflies, most of which were dead, while a few
were fluttering weakly and then died. The butterflies were of various
sizes, some beautifully colored. The reporters discovered several
dead butterflies in the grass past the guard rail. With each passing
car, dead butterflies were carried by the wind and then dropped back
down. As the reporters continued along the road there were numerous
dead butterflies which did not thin out until kilometer 23. After
kilometer 24 they were essentially not seen.

The reporters asked 2 patrolling highway management personnel the
cause of the butterfly deaths. They said they had never before
encountered this kind of situation and that it might have been caused
by excessive heat.

[Hainan is well known for its butterflies, and has been called the
Butterfly Kingdom. There are 609 species of butterflies on the
island, which represents about half the butterfly species of China.
The Jianfengling rainforest has one of the world's biggest
concentrations of butterflies and is sometimes known as the Butterfly
Valley.

I have no idea what caused the death of these butterflies, what
species they were, or whether the dead butterflies comprised more
than one species. However, butterflies often migrate in large
numbers and when they cross busy highways many are killed, as I have
seen in northern Nigeria. It is well known that extreme weather
conditions can cause mortality of adult butterflies, as has been
recorded in the Monarch butterfly (_Danaus plexippus_). Butterflies
do become infected with various pathogens, but death occurs in the
larval stages. Possibly more information will be forthcoming on the
species of butterflies dying in Hainan and the causes of such
mortality. - Mod.MS]
