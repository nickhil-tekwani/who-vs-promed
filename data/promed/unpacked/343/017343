The Ministry of Health confirmed on 15 Jan 2008, 3 more deaths from
yellow fever (YF): 2 in Goias state and one in Parana state, bringing
the total of confirmed cases of YF in 2008 to 6, with 5 deaths, with
15 suspected cases still under investigation. This more than in any
year since 2003, when there were 64 cases with 23 deaths.

One of the fatal cases was an unvaccinated Spanish visitor, who died
after 2 days in hospital in Goiania on 12 Jan 2008, having been ill
for about 10 days in a house [in the city] where the vector mosquito,
_Aedes aegypti_, was found. The area has been fogged with
insecticide. The man contracted his infection at a farm in
Cristianopolis, 103 km (64 mi) from Goiania, where he had spent 15
days. [In an earlier report, his widow complained to the press that
they saw no YF warning or proof of vaccination check at Sao Paulo
international airport on their arrival on 25 Nov 2007, nor at
Salvador or Goiania airports on their travels since then.]

The Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, which produces YF vaccine, has suspended
all exports of the vaccine, and is doubling its production from 15 to
30 million doses this year (2008). It normally supplies 7 million
doses to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) for distribution
to other countries in the Americas.

[The Ministry of Health insists that there is no urban YF epidemic
anywhere in Brazil, which is technically correct. However, it is
taking all the right steps to protect its at-risk population with the
vaccine, and warning international visitors. On 10 Jan 2008 the USA
Department of State issued an alert, in English, to all its citizens
in Brazil, advising them to get vaccinated, see
