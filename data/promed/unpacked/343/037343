ref: Huang YS, Vanlandingham DL, Bilyeu AN, et al. SARS-CoV-2 failure to infect or replicate in mosquitoes: an extreme challenge. Sci Rep. 2020; 10(1): 11915. doi:10.1038/s41598-020-68882-7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
This research addresses public speculation that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted by mosquitoes. The World Health Organization has stated "To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes." Here we provide the 1st experimental data to investigate the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and be transmitted by mosquitoes including tests of 3 widely distributed species of mosquito; _Aedes aegypti_, _Ae. albopictus_, and _Culex quinquefasciatus_, representing the 2 most significant genera of arbovirus vectors that infect people. We demonstrate that even under extreme conditions, SARS-CoV-2 virus is unable to replicate in these mosquitoes and therefore cannot be transmitted to people even in the unlikely event that a mosquito fed upon a viremic host.

Discussion
----------
The most extreme approach for viral challenge of mosquitoes, namely intrathoracic inoculation, was used as an ultimate test of the capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to infect and replicate in mosquitoes. The hypothesis was that if the virus did not replicate in mosquitoes after intrathoracic inoculation, then even if mosquitoes did feed on viremic people, and the virus disseminated from the midgut, the lack of replication would preclude the possibility of biological transmission. We tested 3 widely distributed species of mosquito, representing the 2 most significant genera of arbovirus vectors that infect people. All 3 of the species: _Aedes aegypti_, _Ae. albopictus_, and _Culex quinquefasciatus_ are present in China, the country of origin of SARS-CoV-2. Samples collected within 2 hours of inoculation confirmed efficient delivery of infectious viruses to mosquitoes. Based upon the lack of detectable infectious virus in any of the 277 samples collected at all time points beyond 24 h post-inoculation, we conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is unable to replicate in mosquitoes and that even if a mosquito fed on a person with virus in the blood, that the mosquito would not be a vector if feeding on a naive host.

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Higgs for providing this important report.

Although the tests indicated SARS-CoV-2 virus was unable to replicate in 3 common vector mosquitoes of 2 different genera, one cannot arbitrarily rule out susceptibility of all human-biting mosquitoes in localities where infected people are found. However, the results of the test above do strongly suggest that mosquitoes in general are not susceptible to infection by this virus. This should end speculation about mosquito biological transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus being epidemiologically significant. Mechanical ("flying pin") transmission by interrupted mosquito feeding would require very high viremias in infected individuals, probably 10^6-7 or more and for which there is no evidence, followed almost immediately by feeding on a susceptible person. Attention should be turned to other modes of virus transmission. - Mod.TY]

- 22:06 GMT - USA
The city of Chicago reimposed some coronavirus [COVID-19] restrictions on Monday [20 Jul 2020] and the state of Florida reported more than 10 000 new cases for the 6th day in a row, as the coronavirus pandemic raged across the United States. New York state recorded only 8 deaths on Sunday [19 Jul 2020] while the total number of people hospitalised for the disease fell to 716, the fewest since [18 Mar 2020], Governor Andrew Cuomo said. But metrics for the country as a whole have grown worse. 32 states have reported record increases in COVID-19 cases in July [2020] while 15 states have reported record increases in deaths. Deaths, hospitalisations, and rates of positive test results continue to climb with at least 15 states reporting record hospitalisations so far in July [2020], according to a Reuters tally. [Apparently New York City has had outdoor partiers on the weekends, non-masked, not observing social distancing. It would not be surprising if the daily cases starts increasing in New York City, as the virus is still present. As for elsewhere, the Southeast of the USA is experiencing major surges in cases (see section [3] [E] below.) - Mod.MPP

This year's [2020] hajj, which has been scaled back dramatically to include only around 1000 Muslim pilgrims due to the coronavirus pandemic, will begin on [29 Jul 2020], Saudi authorities said Monday [20 Jul 2020]. "The stand of pilgrims on Mount Arafat, the peak of the hajj ritual, falls on Thursday [30 Jul 2020]," the official Saudi Press Agency. [In a prior post, the Saudi specified the Hajj attendees would be a "very limited number of participants from various nationalities already present in Saudi Arabia."

- 19:00 GMT - Spain
The prevalence of coronavirus in Spain has risen 3-fold over the last 3 weeks as authorities struggle to contain a rash of fresh clusters, mainly in the Catalonia and Aragon regions, Health Ministry data showed on Monday [20 Jul 2020]. After registering thousands of cases and hundreds of deaths per day during an early April [2020] peak, Spain succeeded in slowing the number of new infections to a trickle. But since restrictions on movement were lifted and Spaniards relaxed back into daily life, some 201 new clusters have appeared, with heavy concentrations in and around the Catalan cities of Barcelona and Lleida. The occurrence of the novel coronavirus has jumped from 8 cases per 100 000 inhabitants at the end of June [2020], when the country's state of emergency ended, to 27 per 100 000, deputy health emergency chief Maria Sierra told a news conference on Monday [20 Jul 2020]. "Where measures have been relaxed is where these clusters appear," Health Minister Salvador Illa said. "We're talking about gatherings of extended family and spaces associated with nightlife" [Another country experiencing major increases in transmission after lifting restrictions. - Mod.MPP

Bahamas will shut its borders to international flights and commercial vessels carrying passengers, the country's prime minister said. Flights from the UK, Canada, and EU countries are exempted, Hubert Minnis said. The restrictions will come into effect on Wednesday [22 Jul 2020]. Bahamas has reported 153 cases and 11 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. [Hmmm, exempting high incidence COVID-19 countries... - Mod.MPP

- 15:45 GMT - Indigenous people
Indigenous communities comprising half a million people around the world are especially vulnerable to the new coronavirus pandemic due to often poor living conditions, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that as of [6 Jul 2020], there were more than 70 000 cases reported among indigenous peoples in the Americas, with over 2000 deaths [see WHO situation report section [4] below, and COVID-19 update (193): global, China, CFRs, Amazon Indigenous pop, WHO 20200519.7352326 for more background. - Mod.MPP

Indonesia reported its 2nd-highest daily increase in coronavirus-related deaths with 96 fatalities, a day after registering a record daily jump in deaths, data presented by health ministry official Achmad Yurianto showed. The country also reported 1693 new infections, taking the total to 88 214, the highest number in East or Southeast Asia, with a total of 4239 deaths.

Hong Kong reported 73 new cases, including 66 that were locally transmitted, as new restrictions took effect and authorities warned there was no indication that the situation was coming under control. The global financial hub reported more than 100 cases on Sunday [19 Jul 2020], a record number as Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced that non-essential civil servants must work from home [see section [2][A] below for a few more details and link to the Hong Kong CHP report on the 73 newly confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP

The Philippines' health ministry confirmed 4 new coronavirus deaths and 1521 new cases, its 5th straight day of reporting over a thousand infections. In a bulletin, the ministry said total deaths have increased to 1835 while confirmed cases have reached 69 898. [Since 1 Jul 2020, daily newly confirmed case reports have varied from a low of 294 on 2 Jul 2020 to a high of 2486 on 8 Jul 2020, with daily reports of greater than 1000 cases on 16 out of the 20 days so far this month (July 2020) and daily reports of greater than 2000 cases on 7 days during July 2020. - Mod.MPP

- 08:38 GMT - France
French authorities have reported 400 to 500 active coronavirus outbreak clusters but there are no signs of an imminent "2nd wave," Health Minister Olivier Veran said. Many of the current virus clusters involve abattoirs or other contained professional settings such as old age homes, he said. Others had resulted from family reunions during the summer holidays. "At this point we are very far from a 2nd wave," Veran told Franceinfo radio, as face masks were made mandatory in all enclosed public spaces including shops, covered markets, and administrative buildings. "The goal is not to worry people excessively, but to keep them on their guard," he said. [Abattoirs are a high risk work place with difficulty in observing social distancing. The indoor locations are consistent with observations elsewhere of the need to where masks indoors to prevent transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.MPP

- 07:05 GMT - India reports 40 000 new cases, a record daily surge in infections
India reported 40 425 new cases of the coronavirus, a record high for the country. The new infections raised the country's total number of cases to 1 118 043, including 27 497 deaths. The ministry said late on Sunday [19 Jul 2020] that India's coronavirus fatality rate -- currently at 2.49 percent -- is "progressively falling" due to an effective containment strategy and aggressive testing. A country of 1.4 billion people, India has been conducting nearly 10 000 tests per million people. More than 300 000 samples are being tested daily now, compared to just a few hundred in March [2020], according to the Indian Council of Medical Research, India's top medical research body. With a surge in infections in the past few weeks, local governments in India have been ordering focused lockdowns in high-risk areas.

- 07:01 GMT - Pakistan
Active cases of the coronavirus continue to drop in Pakistan, where the government says it is testing fewer people because there has been a drop in the number of patients seeking treatment for COVID-19. On Sunday [19 Jul 2020], at least 1587 new cases of the virus were registered, taking the country's overall tally to 265 083 since its outbreak began in late February [2020]. Active cases, however, fell by 97, as the case increase was offset by recoveries. Active cases are now at 53 465, their lowest level since [3 Jun 2020] At least 31 deaths took the death toll to 5689 on Sunday [19 Jul 2020], the data showed. [1-3 Jul 2020, daily case counts were greater than 4000, 4-6 Jul 2020 greater than 3000 per day, 7-18 Jul 2020 mostly in the greater than 2000 per day with 2 days above 3000, and in the past 2 days (19/20 Jul 2020), case counts have dropped to 1500-1700 cases. - Mod.MPP

- 01:50 GMT - Australia
Australia's 2nd-most populous state of Victoria on Monday [20 Jul 2020] recorded one death from the new coronavirus and 275 new cases compared with 363 a day earlier, according to Reuters news agency. A woman in her 80s died from the virus overnight, Premier Daniel Andrews said in a briefing in Melbourne, taking the national death toll to 123. Coronavirus cases have spiked in Victoria in July 2020], mostly in Melbourne, prompting authorities to ask residents to wear face masks when they step outside their houses or risk fines of 200 Australian dollars ($140) for not complying.

- 00:30 GMT - Mexico
Mexico's health ministry reported 5311 new confirmed coronavirus infections and 296 additional deaths, bringing the total in the country to 344 224 cases, including 39 184 deaths, according to Reuters. The government has said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. [Mexico has been in the top 10 countries in terms of cumulative cases and daily case reports for some time now. For many countries the "real number of infected individuals" is significantly higher than the number of confirmed cases -- at least 10% higher, recognizing the lack of capture of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases. - Mod.MPP

[B] South Korea: 13 816 confirmed cases, 296 deaths
[C] Italy: 244 624 total cases, 35 048 deaths
[D] Iran: 276 202 total cases, 14 405 deaths
[E] USA: 3 961 429 total cases, 143 834 deaths

[These countries have been selected based on having had significant surges with SARS-CoV-2 infections, but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters and temporary new restrictions have impacted. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly with major resurgences. - Mod.MPP]

[There were 11 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours; 3 were imported, and 8 were locally acquired -- 7 in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and 1 in Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. This brings the tally of this new cluster up to 58 cases -- not counting asymptomatic infections. According to a media report, a 2nd city is now involved to the southwest of Urumqi - Kashgar (Xinjiang https://en.brinkwire.com/us/fresh-outbreak-in-xinjiang-spreads-to-a-second-city-as-hong-kong-faces-out-of-control-surge/). It is now 15 days with no new cases reported from Beijing.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals (1 imported) and 1 new conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. Since 18 May 2020, China has reported 39 cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic infection.

Hong Kong reported 73 new cases. The official government site in Hong Kong mentions a total of 1958 cases (confirmed) and 1 probable. The newly reported cases announced today (20 Jul 2020) involve 31 males and 42 females aged between 4 and 94 years. Among them, 7 had travel history during the incubation period, 8 were asymptomatic. (https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202007/20/P2020072000862.htm). Travel history was the Philippines (1), Japan/South Korea (1), South Korea (1), Kazakhstan (1), Ethiopia (1), and Qatar (1). (https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202007/20/P2020072000862_346159_1_1595259445402.pdf)

Takeaway message: China continues to have importations of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 and has occasional cluster flair-ups (see comments in the section on South Korea below). Hong Kong is dealing with increased local transmission associated with the lifting of restrictions; new severe restrictions have been announced. Cases are primarily locally transmitted although there are importations.

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 45 cases with 0 new deaths, compared with 26 cases and 1 new death in the previous day (19 Jul 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 97 consecutive days. There were 20 locally transmitted cases: Seoul (18), Gyeonggi (1), and Jeju (1); and 25 imported cases: airport quarantine (18), Seoul (3), Daegu (2), Gyeonggi (1), Gyeongbuk (1). 12 provinces reported no newly confirmed cases (compared with 7 provinces yesterday, 19 Jul 2020). Information on the cases in Seoul is not available at the time of preparation of this update.

The overall impression hasn't changed. Lifting of measures was accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. Contact tracing and isolation seem to have had an impact. Now importations are playing a major role in the country as well. Looking at both China and South Korea, I suspect that importations may result in the occasional silent spread from asymptomatic infections which may be missed through the testing (false negatives). A superspreading event may result, leading to a recognized cluster, which can ultimately be interrupted until the next cycle occurs. The increase in cases in the past few days has been paralleled by increases in reported deaths.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is up by +190 cases and +13 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (18 Jul 2020) 24-hour change was +219 cases and +3 deaths. The hospitalized cases and cases in intensive care units are still in a slow decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna, the main provinces at the original epicenter of the outbreak (see tables at the link on the source URL. The provinces reporting the largest numbers of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period are Lombardy (56), Emilia-Romagna (42), and Veneto (42), Lazio (14), and Liguria (12), are the provinces reporting 10 or more cases. A total of 16 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases).

Iran's Health Ministry spokeswoman says 240 087 coronavirus patients have recovered from the disease so far and been discharged from the hospital.

In a press briefing on Monday [20 Jul 2020], Sima-Sadat Lari said 217 people have also died of the virus in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of fatalities to 14 405. She confirmed 2414 new cases of infection with the novel coronavirus, raising the total number of cases to 276 202 [this count differs with our count (276 070) but multiple sources give this so an adjustment must have been made by the government. - Mod.MPP]

3583 patients are also in severe condition of the disease, she added. Lari noted that 2 175 217 COVID-19 tests have been taken across the country. She said there has been no change in the list of "red" and "orange" zones of COVID-19 risk in the country, urging people to wear face masks, observe social distancing and health protocols.

[As of 20 Jul 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 276 202, including 14 405 deaths, an increase of 2414 cases and 217 deaths since 19 Jul 2020. The daily new case count has been in the 2000-2500 range and newly reported deaths hovering around 200 plus. One key question is whether this level of transmission and disease prevalence is manageable by the health sector or if there are additional deaths due to the health sector being overwhelmed -- an unfortunate consequence many countries have been faced with when local surges have occurred.

[The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 3 961 429 including 143 834 deaths, an increase from 3 898 550 cases and 143 289 deaths in the past 24 hours. Unless there is a major decrease in numbers of newly identified cases on 21 Jul 2020, the USA will cross the 4 million case mark tomorrow (21 Jul 2020). New York City had a cumulative total of 218 478 cases as of 13:00 EDT (GMT-4) on 20 Jul 2020 (+319 since 19 Jul 2020) including 18 787 (+11 since 19 Jul 2020) confirmed deaths and an additional 4624 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are Florida, California, Texas, Louisiana, Georgia, (US Military), Alabama, Tennessee, Arizona, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Note that 6 of the 10 states are located in the south east region of the country. This list includes states that are showing major increases in daily cases reported beginning with the lifting of restrictions around the end of May 2020. All of the top 10 states reported more than 1500 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, with the range being 1459 to 10 347. This now makes 13 out of the 20 days of July 2020 so far that Florida has reported over 10 000 cases a day with several days surpassing 15 000 cases. In terms of cumulative case reports, the order is unchanged from previous days with New York as number one, followed by California, Florida, Texas, New Jersey, Illinois, Georgia (surpassed Arizona in the past 24 hours), Arizona, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania. A total of 45 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

In the past 24 hours, the proportional increase of newly confirmed cases was 1.7%. The 7-day average of newly confirmed cases for the past 7 days is 12.4% higher than the 7-day average for the preceding 7 days, consistent with the ongoing pandemic in the country, but gradually slowing down, but may reflect a change in reporting in the USA that began on Mon 13 Jul 2020, combined with weekend artifact.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing, and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance, and emergency room visits, which are definitely worth reviewing, as a welcome series of analyses. According to the CDC data, as of 20 Jul 2020, the percentage of laboratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with a molecular assay remained at 9% out of 48 603 115 tests performed as of 20 Jul 2020, consistent with the ongoing, not-yet-under-control pandemic in the country (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html).

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 20 Jul 2020.

Highlights
----------
- As the pandemic deepens economic and social stress, the risk of gender-based violence intensifies, with serious consequences for mental health of those at risk. WHO Regional Director for the Americas, Dr Carissa F Etienne emphasized the need for integrating psychosocial support and mental health services as part of the COVID19 response.

- More than one million patients have recovered from COVID-19 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region since [29 Jan 2020]. WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean, Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari acknowledged this positive milestone, and urged countries to continue to engage communities, promote the recovery of COVID-19 patients, and provide strong government leadership.

- During health emergencies, one of WHO's most vital roles is to gather data and research from around the world, evaluate it, and advise countries on how to respond by working closely with experts from around the world. More than 100 documents have been published by WHO on COVID-19 since January 2020. You can find a summary of WHO's role in a pandemic and of the key documents that have been issued.

- Today [20 Jul 2020] we include 2 reports in the 'Subject in Focus' below. The 1st describes 'COVID-19 and Indigenous peoples in the region of the Americas'. The 2nd provides an update on 'partner coordination'.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:

- The Americas region reported 58.1% of the global newly reported cases and 60.8% of newly reported deaths for this 24-hour period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 7.5 million cases. The USA reported 50.1% (66 963) cases, Brazil 21.4% (28 532), Colombia 6.4% (8560), Mexico 5.7% (7615), Guatemala 3.2% (4233), Peru 3.0% (3963), Argentina 2.4% (3223), and Chile 1.6% (2084).

- The European region reported 7.5% of the global newly reported cases and 9.6% of the newly confirmed deaths globally. Russia reported 34.6% (5940) of the regional newly confirmed cases, followed by Kazakhstan reporting 8.7% (1499), Israel 8.4% (1440), Turkey 5.4% (924), Romania 4.5% (767), the UK 4.2% (726), Ukraine 3.8% (651), Kyrgyzstan 3.6% (611), Uzbekistan 3.1% (537), Serbia 2.3% (396), Azerbaijan 2.3% (388), and Poland 2.1% (358).

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.6% of the global newly reported cases and 9.0% of global newly reported fatalities. Saudi Arabia reported 19.6% (2504) of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iraq 18.1% (2310), Iran 17.1% (2182), Pakistan 12.4% (1587), Oman 9.0% (1157), Egypt 4.7% (603), Palestinian Authority 3.6% (465), Bahrain 3.3% (418), Qatar 2.7% (340), and Kuwait 2.3% (300).

- The African region reported 7.9% of the global newly reported cases and 2.8% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 74.2% (13 449) of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Ethiopia 3.9% (704), Ghana 3.3% (607), Kenya 3.3% (603), Nigeria 3.1% (556), Algeria 3.0% (535), and Cote d'Ivoire 2.3% (423).

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.5% of the global newly reported cases and 1.3% of global deaths. The Philippines reported 63.2% (2152) of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Japan 13.3% (454), Australia 10.6% (361), Singapore 7.5% (257), China 3.8% (131), and South Korea 0.76% (26).

- The South East Asia region reported 19.5% of the global newly reported cases and 16.53% of global deaths. India reported 90.4% (40 425) of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 5.5% (2459) and Indonesia 3.7% (1639).

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region and the Western Pacific representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. The progression has been the initial "surge" in the Western Pacific region, followed by the surge in the European region and its decline; the entry and surging of the Americas region without any decrease, and the gradual and persistent increase in the South East Asia region; the increase then plateauing of the Eastern Mediterranean region, the slow but steady increase in the Africa region, and a slight increase in the Western Pacific region. Countries that are showing increased activity include Iraq, Guatemala. It appears as though Russia has peaked and is now declining.

[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 14 852 700, with reports of cases by 217 countries and territories worldwide. The global case count rose by 1.5% in the past 24 hours. The USA and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts, although India has been rapidly increasing, with daily case counts around 40 000.

In the past 24 hours, the USA reported the most newly confirmed cases (62 879) followed by India (36 810), and Brazil (21 749). The total cumulative case counts for the top 5 countries (USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa) represent over half of the total cases reported globally (56.5%). A global total of 613 213 deaths have been reported, an increase of 4356 deaths in the past 24 hours.

In descending rank order, the USA is number one for the number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by India, Brazil, South Africa, Colombia, Russia, Mexico, Spain, Peru, and Argentina. Argentina displaced Saudi Arabia on this list. All these countries are currently experiencing major community-based transmission and considered global hot spots. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed cases goes from 4019 to 62 879.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 8.0%. I suspect this is watered down by the weekend days when multiple countries do not report cases.

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts. That being said, the most severely affected region is the Americas, with cases increasing on a daily basis even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). - Mod.MPP]
