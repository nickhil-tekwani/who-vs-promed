A case of mumps has been reported in an individual who participated in "The Clash XV", a wrestling tournament in Rochester, MN on 30-31 Dec 2016. Teams from 16 states participated in the event, and wrestlers from 4 states had direct contact with the case and will be notified separately. [A total of 600 individuals were potentially exposed].

The Minnesota Department of Health received notification from the Washington State Department of Health that a Washington resident who participated in The Clash tournament on 30-31 Dec 2016 was reported as a mumps case in their ongoing outbreak. Symptom onset was early January 2017, and the case was infectious during the wrestling tournament. Participants in the event included individuals from Washington, Minnesota, North Dakota, California, Georgia, Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, Florida, Missouri, Wisconsin, South Dakota, New England, Ohio, Alabama, and Utah. Four states, including Minnesota, Illinois, California, and Oregon had team members who were directly exposed to the case and will be notified individually.

Mumps can occur in persons with 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) with intense and repeated exposure. Precautions for mumps infection include making sure people are up to date with 2 doses of MMR vaccine, practicing good hand hygiene, and isolating symptomatic persons to avoid other exposures.

Wrestlers or other participants who develop parotitis or other mumps-compatible illness (e.g., orchitis, oophoritis) regardless of vaccine status, should follow-up with their health care provider, inform the provider that they may have been exposed to a mumps case, and take precautions against exposing others.

There is a mumps outbreak in Spokane, and local health officials say it could be headed our way.

Spokane had 56 cases of mumps as of Tue [17 Jan 2017] evening, and the number is expected to rise.

Melanie Collett, spokeswoman for the Panhandle Health District, said there are no confirmed cases of mumps in North Idaho, but that will likely change, given the region's proximity to Spokane.

"This is a very fluid situation, and we're working with local physicians to make sure any suspect cases are being reported and tested," Collett said.

Mumps, a contagious disease caused by a virus, typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands. Mumps is often transmitted by people who are in close contact with one another, such as those living in the same house or dorm. Mumps usually goes away on its own in about 10 days. But in some cases, it can cause complications that affect the brain, the testicles, the ovaries, or the pancreas.

Kootenai Health has been alerted the outbreak is nearby and has isolation policies that go into effect if an outbreak of a communicable disease does come into the region.

Kim Papich, public information officer for the Spokane Regional Health District, said there is some evidence the Spokane outbreak is linked to a mumps outbreak in Seattle which started in late November 2016 and is still continuing, with 130 cases plus more in 5 surrounding counties.

Of the 56 cases in Spokane, 34 are people who previously received the mumps, measles and rubella (MMR) vaccination. Ten of the cases are people who were not vaccinated, and there are 12 cases in which the vaccination status is unknown.

"This has quickly turned into a polarized discussion on vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, but we have so many cases that we're beyond that," Papich said, noting that vaccinated individuals are 9 times less likely to get the mumps. "We have about 400 000 vaccinated people in Spokane; only 27 of them are sick. If they weren't vaccinated, we'd have 400 000 people with the mumps."

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 doses of the vaccine are roughly 88 percent -- with a range of 66 to 95 percent -- effective at protecting against mumps. One dose is 49-92 percent effective.

The CDC also reports the last big outbreak of mumps in the U.S. was in 2006 when there were more than 6500 cases. Between 2011 and 2015, the national number of cases hovered between about 250 cases to 1500 cases. In 2016, however, the preliminary count was about 5500 cases, mostly concentrated in Iowa and Illinois at college campuses.

There are one or 2 cases of mumps in Idaho, but that's normal, and they're unlikely to be related to the Spokane outbreak, Papich said.

Cory Webster, infection prevention coordinator for Kootenai Health, said that other than vaccination, people can take steps to reduce the likelihood of getting any disease.

"People can stay home from school or work if they're sick, wash hands, appropriately cover coughs, and avoid sharing drinks and eating utensils," she said. "Right now, we are educating our staff, patients and visitors."

Webster encouraged people who are ill to refrain from visiting loved ones at Kootenai Health, and to seek care for themselves.

Ultimately, vaccination is the best way to prevent mumps, according to both Panhandle and Spokane Regional health districts.

The mumps outbreak in Washington state is on the cusp of 300 confirmed and probable cases, as 291 have been reported in 5 counties through Wed [25 Jan 2017].

The breakdown stands at King County (163), Spokane County (90), Pierce County (34), Snohomish County (3) and Yakima County (1).

In King County, 63.2 percent of patients report being up to date on their measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Roughly the same percentage has been reported as fully vaccinated in Spokane County.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mumps is a viral illness that is transmitted by direct contact with respiratory droplets or saliva from an infected person. It is best known for painful, swollen salivary glands that show up as puffy cheeks and swollen jaw.

Boys may also have painful, swollen testicles. Other symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite.

There is no treatment, and symptoms usually resolve themselves within a few weeks. Mumps is usually a mild disease in children, but adults may have more serious disease with complications.

A large outbreak of the mumps across the nation could be rippling into Colorado, health officials warned Friday [27 Jan 2017], as 14 cases were diagnosed in January 2017 alone.

Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) officials launched a large investigation with the Tri-County Health Department and Denver Public Health after 11 patients in Denver and Aurora learned they were diagnosed with the viral infection. Three other patients were diagnosed but aren't believed to be part of the outbreak, which overall could be linked to other states, specifically Washington.

A fact sheet has been disseminated to doctors and physicians in the area, urging them to consider patients who have salivary gland swelling for further testing.

As mumps cases often go undetected or untested, the outbreak in Colorado is "likely" to grow, CDPHE officials said.

Even those who are vaccinated are susceptible to mumps, as the vaccine is only roughly 88 percent effective, and effectiveness can wane after the vaccine has been administered.

Mumps is an infection spread by direct human-to-human contact through respiratory droplets or saliva. Average incubation periods range from 16 to 18 days on average but can be up to 12 to 25 days.

Symptoms of the infection aren't limited to swelling of salivary and parotid glands across the cheek and jaw area; swelling can range from the frontal part of the ear and spread as fluid builds up. Other symptoms can at times include low-grade fevers, malaise, loss of appetite, headache and more, but not all who have mumps will exhibit symptoms.

Severe complications from the infection are rare but can include sterility, spontaneous abortion, deafness, and more.

The risks associated with the infection have prompted health officials concerned about the thousands of current cases across the nation to ask parents to be on the lookout.

"Because of the high numbers of mumps cases across the country, it is especially important to make sure your children are vaccinated," Rachel Herlihy, director of the Disease Control and Environmental Epidemiology Division at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said.

"Both adults and children should make sure they are up to date on their mumps vaccine."

In Colorado, the CDPHE says that for children between 19 and 35 months old, 93.6 percent have one or more doses of the vaccine. For children between 13 and 17 years old, 92.3 percent have 2 or more doses of the vaccine.

[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the nationwide spike in mumps cases to continue into next month [February 2017].

According to the CDC, mumps cases hit a 10-year high in late December 2016, with 5311 cases in the US.

Two of the largest outbreaks happened on university campuses in Iowa and Illinois; 220 cases were also reported at the University of Missouri by mid-December [2016].

The case count is lower than in 2006, when more than 6500 people were sickened. It's also down dramatically since the U.S. began its vaccination program in 1967. Before the push to get vaccinated, roughly 186 000 mumps cases were reported each year.

The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps, health officials say. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 percent effective at protecting against mumps; one dose is 78 percent effective, according to the CDC (Excerpted from: http://woodtv.com/2017/01/13/cdc-mumps-cases-hit-10-year-high/).
