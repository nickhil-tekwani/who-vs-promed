Cases of chicken pox are on the rise in the city, say doctors with an average of 5 -- 6 new cases being reported at private hospitals every week. At government facilities, the number is higher with the per-week count of patients often touching 15. According to authorities, while the 1st cases of chicken pox, this year [2018], started to surface almost 2 months ago, the numbers are now rising steadily.

"Though we do get cases throughout the year, the rate of occurrence is maximum between March and May. We are getting about 5 cases every week now," said Dr Vikram Simha Reddy, consultant physician, Century Super Specialty Hospitals. ...-more

Usually, it is a childhood disease but can occur at any age. Chicken pox is a contagious viral disease caused by the Varicella Zoster Virus that spreads through direct contact with the infected person. Patients are usually infected from 2 days before the rash appears to 5 days after the rash and are instructed to avoid contact with anyone during this period. "The earlier you start the treatment, the slower is the progression of rashes. The start of antivirals also helps in preventing major complications, including epididymo-orchitis, pneumonitis and pancreatitis," said Dr Rahul Agarwal, senior consultant internal medicine, Max-Cure Hospitals.

According to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, 3 -- 4 patients suffering from chickenpox are visiting the hospital daily.

"Most of the chickenpox patients are children. Children are prone to this viral infection as they have lower immunity," said Dr Anup Bastola, consultant tropical medicine physician, dermatologist and venereologist at STIDH.

There is humidity in the air and the season is favourable for the virus to spread. This is why chickenpox cases are increasing, said the doctor.
