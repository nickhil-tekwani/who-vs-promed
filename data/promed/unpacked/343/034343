Fraser Health is reporting 5 lab-confirmed cases of mumps in
Chilliwack, in the wake of larger outbreaks in Alberta. "It's been
coming at us from east to west," said Fraser Health medical health
officer Dr Gillian Arsenault, who pointed to cases documented in Nova
Scotia, and later Alberta.

"Apparently some of those infected [in Chilliwack] had either direct
or indirect contact with the Alberta connection. So for anyone
planning to go to Alberta, now is a good time to get vaccinated," she
said.

The local cases are likely just the tip of the iceberg given the
"sneaky" nature of the mumps virus, she said. The virus is spread by
saliva, so a cough or sneeze can send it travelling through the air
with fine mist droplets. "When we have lab-confirmed cases, it means
there are more cases we don't know about," said Dr Arsenault. "The
reason for that is roughly one-third of infected people display no
symptoms at all. For them it's just like a rotten cold." Another
third of sufferers will experience swollen glands, testicles, or some
other physical clue, and the swelling always comes on the heels of
the cold-like symptoms. An individual who's been exposed can be
infected and not know it, she said. "It only takes one coughing
infected person in an ER or waiting room to spread the virus."

A mumps alert went out from Fraser Health offices last week [3-9 Mar
2008] warning Chilliwack residents to make sure their vaccinations
are up to date. Older adults are more at risk for serious disease, if
they're not immune through vaccination or through having had the
disease. "People born before 1970 tend to have been around the virus
and are more likely to be immune," she said. "The hardest hit include
teens and young adults. Those who are 18 years or younger, attending
post-secondary, or child/health care workers born after 1956, are
eligible for 2 free doses of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine.

"If you have been around someone who has the mumps, you might have
it, so check your vaccinations and if you think you may have it,
phone first before heading into your doctor's office," Dr Arsenault
said. "There is no 100 per cent guarantee of immunity, so everyone
needs to be careful." Since the mumps infection affects the salivary
glands, she said it's crucial to avoid sharing mouthpieces, drinking
glasses, and other ways of "swapping spit." Asked if she thought
British Columbia's population was immune enough to stop an outbreak,
she couldn't answer definitively. "We don't know," she said. Small
clusters of mumps cases have been reported in other communities over
the past year, which didn't in fact turn into larger outbreaks of the
virus. "We're hoping the same will happen here," said the health
official. "We don't know how fast or how big this iceberg is, so it's
a good time to get the word out. The more people know, the more
likelihood it won't turn into a big outbreak." Mumps "very rarely"
kill people, she said, but they can fall ill and feel awful.

A total of 399 cases were reported in Alberta between 1 Sep 2007 and
4 Mar 2008, with the majority of cases in the Chinook region of
southern Alberta, and the rest in Calgary. There were also outbreaks
in Nova Scotia. "It shows we're not completely immune," said
Arsenault. "When that happens the waves of outbreaks are further
apart."

[The Canadian mumps outbreak of 2007 has progressed across Canada
from east to west and has now reached the Pacific coast of British
Columbia. It remains to be seen whether the British Columbian
health-care system will have more success in containing this mumps
outbreak than their Albertan counterpart, which has had to deal with
399 cases so far.
