Trichinella-infected sausages made with pork from a hunted wild boar have been placed on the market in Saxony (Germany). The products, a raw-fermented sausage containing boar meat and boar meat roast, have been sold in the German federal states of Saxony and in the south of Brandenburg by a company's fleet of mobile market vendors.

The area where the products were distributed borders Poland and the Czech Republic. According to a health alert from the Ministry of Saxony, the roast ("Wildschweinbraten") and the sausages ("Wildschweinknacker") were sold on 26-27 Mar 2013, and the roast also on 23 Mar 2013.

More information can be found on the RKI website:
http://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/T/Trichinellose/Trichinenbelastetes_Wildschweinfleisch_03_2013.html.

So far, no cases of trichinellosis have been observed. Given the variable incubation period (5-45 days) and the shelf life of the sausages, we would like to know about any trichinellosis cases with a symptom onset between the end of March 2013 and the end of June 2013 with a travel history to the affected area.

The contact person at the RKI is Dr. Faber (<faberm@rki.de>;

[ProMED-mail thanks Karsten Nockler and Edoardo Pozio for this information.

Wild boar is a well known source of _Trichinella_ in Europe. It is not clear from the text whether the wild boar meat was deliberately introduced without proper veterinary control or whether it was by accident. So far, no human cases have been registered. - Mod.EP]
