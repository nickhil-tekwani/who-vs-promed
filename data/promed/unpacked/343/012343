Nipah virus claimed 2 more lives on Saturday [1 Mar 2008], raising
the death toll to 6 since its fresh outbreak was reported last week
[25 Feb-2 Mar 2008] in Manikganj and Rajbari districts [Dhaka
Division]. A child, 9, and an adult, 55, died at Rajbari Sadar
Hospital on Saturday. Another child, 11, died on Thursday [28 Feb
2008] in Rajbari, while 3 children of a family died in Manikganj. The
Institute of Epidemiology Diseases Control and Research on Saturday
[1 Mar 2008] confirmed that all the 6 deaths were caused by Nipah
virus, which staged a comeback after a gap of 3 years and was now
concentrated on 2 districts.

[The institute said in a press release 3 Nipah-infected persons have
been cured while 2 others are undergoing treatment at Rajbari Sadar
Hospital]. Biochemical tests carried out in IEDCR (Institute of
Epidemiology, Disease Control & Research) laboratory detected Nipah
virus, which causes encephalitis and spreads to humans mainly by
fruit bats.

Virologists said the virus causes fatal inflammation of the brain,
associated with high fever often leading to unconsciousness. They
advised people in the Nipah-prevalent areas not to eat fruits bitten
or half-bitten by fruit bats, or drink raw juices of palm and date
trees. They also suggested that date juice should not be collected in
open pitchers. Two teams from IEDCR have been working in the
Nipah-affected areas. A team comprising medical officers Sharmin
Sultana and Nusrat Humaira was sent to Rajbari. The institute's
senior scientific officer Saima Afroz is leading another team in
Manikganj.

The deadly Nipah virus has returned to Bangladesh, killing at least 8
people since the latest outbreak was confirmed, officials said Sunday
[1 Mar 2008]. Nipah induces flu-like symptoms that often lead to
encephalitis and coma, with at least a 70 percent mortality rate in
Bangladesh. The latest outbreak was confirmed on Friday [29 Feb 2008].

"So far 8 people including 4 children have died in the latest
outbreak of the Nipah virus in (central) Manikganj and Rajbari
districts," said Mahmudur Rahman, a senior health official. "Several
others are in critical condition. We told people not to be panicked.
We have also increased surveillance in the affected area," he said.

At least 89 people have died of the virus since the 1st outbreak in
2001. The Bangladesh government has set up a detection laboratory to
speed up testing for any outbreak. In 2004, the same 2 districts
reported the worst outbreak, when nearly 40 people died, and the
United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was
called in to help combat the disease.

The virus, named after the Malaysian village where it was first
detected, jumped the species barrier from fruit bats to pigs and then
to humans in October 1998. It is believed to be caught through direct
contact with pigs. In 1999, 256 people in Malaysia fell ill with the
disease, and 4 in 10 patients died. More than a million pigs were
slaughtered to help curb its spread.

[Nipah virus is a member of the family _Paramyxoviridae_. Its name
originated from Sungai Nipah, a village in the Malaysian Peninsula
where pig farmers became ill with encephalitis. Nipah virus was first
reported in pigs and thence humans in Malaysia in 1998. The disease
in pigs was relatively mild. Human cases of Nipah virus infection,
apparently unassociated with infection in livestock, have been
reported in Bangladesh since 2001. Species of fruit bats (genus
_Pteropus_) have been identified as natural hosts of Nipah virus.
Anthropogenic changes (habitat loss, hunting) that have impacted the
population dynamics of _Pteropus_ species across much of their range
are hypothesised to have facilitated emergence.

Nipah virus has been transmitted to humans, cats, and dogs through
close contact with infected pigs. However, person-to-person
transmission can occur. An encephalitis outbreak was investigated in
Faridpur District, Bangladesh, in April-May 2004. 36 cases of Nipah
virus illness were identified; 75 percent of case-patients died.
Multiple peaks of illness occurred, and 33 case-patients had close
contact with another Nipah virus patient. RT-PCR (reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) testing of environmental
samples confirmed Nipah virus contamination of hospital surfaces.
This investigation provided evidence for person-to-person
transmission of Nipah virus [see: Gurley ES, Montgomery JM, Hossain
MJ, Bell M, Azad AK, Islam MR, et al: Person-to-person transmission
of Nipah virus in a Bangladeshi community. Emerg Infect Dis. 2007
Jul; 13(7): 1031-7, available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/7/1031.htm>].

Nipah virus illness begins with 3-14 days of fever and headache
followed by drowsiness and disorientation characterized by mental
confusion. These signs and symptoms can progress to coma within 24-48
hours. Some patients have had a respiratory illness during the early
part of their infections.

During the Nipah virus disease outbreak in 1998-99 in Malaysia, 257
patients were infected with the virus. About 40 percent of those
patients who entered hospitals with serious nervous disease died from
the illness.
