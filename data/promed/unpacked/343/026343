Ebola virus disease, West Africa -- update 25 Jul 2014
------------------------------------------------------
New cases and deaths attributable to EVD continue to be reported by the ministries of health in the 3 West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Between 21-23 Jul 2014, 108 new cases of EVD, including 12 deaths, were reported from the 3 countries as follows:

- Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths;
- Liberia, 25 new cases with 2 deaths;
- Sierra Leone, 71 new cases and 5 deaths.

These numbers include laboratory-confirmed, probable, and suspect cases and deaths of EVD.

As of 23 Jul 2014, the cumulative number of cases attributed to EVD in the 3 countries stands at 1201, including 672 deaths. The distribution and classification of the cases are as follows:

- Guinea, 427 cases (311 confirmed, 99 probable, and 17 suspected) and 319 deaths (208 confirmed, 99 probable, and 12 suspected);
- Liberia, 249 cases (84 confirmed, 84 probable, and 81 suspected) and 129 deaths (60 confirmed, 50 probable, and 19 suspected);
- Sierra Leone, 525 cases (419 confirmed, 56 probable, and 50 suspected) and 224 deaths (188 confirmed, 33 probable, and 3 suspected).

The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to monitor the evolution of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. The Ebola epidemic trend remains precarious, with community and health-facility transmissions of infection still taking place.

Between 21-23 Jul 2014, 96 new cases and 7 deaths were reported from Liberia and Sierra Leone, while in Guinea, 12 new cases and 5 deaths were reported during the same period. These include suspect, probable, and laboratory-confirmed cases. The surge in the number of new EVD cases in Guinea after weeks of low viral activity demonstrates that undetected chains of transmission existed in the community. This phenomenon is retrogressive to the control of the EVD outbreak; and calls for stepping up outbreak containment measures, especially effective contact tracing.

In addition, the Ministry of Health of Nigeria has reported the 1st probable case of EVD on 23 Jul 2014. The case is a Liberian national who recently travelled to Nigeria, where he presented in hospital with symptoms of EVD.

The regional director for the Africa Region, Dr Luis Sambo, continued his fact-finding mission in the 3 affected countries. After visiting Liberia earlier in the week (21-22 Jul 2014), he visited Sierra Leone (22-23 Jul 2014) and Guinea (23-25 Jul 2014). The goal of his visits was to assess 1st-hand the EVD outbreak, review the current response and challenges, and explore the best ways to rapidly contain the outbreak in West Africa. On 24 Jul 2014, the prime minister of Guinea and the regional director officially inaugurated the WHO Sub-regional Outbreak Coordination Centre (SEOCC) in Conakry. The centre will consolidate and harmonize the technical support at local, country, regional, and international level.

WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Guinea, Liberia, or Sierra Leone based on the current information available for this event.

[2] Nigeria case, Togo alert

Nigeria death shows EVD can spread by air travel
------------------------------------------------
Nigerian health authorities raced to stop the spread of Ebola virus disease [EVD] on Saturday [26 Jul 2014] after a man sick with one of the world's deadliest diseases brought it by plane to Lagos, Africa's largest city with 21 million people.

The fact that the traveler from Liberia could board an international flight also raised new fears that other passengers could take the disease beyond Africa due to weak inspection of passengers and the fact EVD's symptoms are similar to other diseases. [But he was symptomless upon boarding -- see below.]

Officials in the country of Togo, where the sick man's flight had a [2-hour] stopover, also went on high alert after learning that EVD could possibly have spread to [another] country. Screening people as they enter the country may help slow the spread of the disease, but it is no guarantee EVD won't travel by airplane, according to Dr Lance Plyler, who heads EVD medical efforts in Liberia for aid organization Samaritan's Purse. "Unfortunately the initial signs of EVD imitate other diseases, like malaria or typhoid," he said.

The aid organization on Saturday [26 Jul 2014] said a US doctor working with EVD patients in Liberia had tested positive for the deadly virus. A Samaritan's Purse news release said Dr Kent Brantly was being treated at a hospital in Monrovia, the capital.

EVD already had caused some 672 deaths across a wide swath of West Africa before the Nigeria case was announced. It is the deadliest outbreak on record for EVD, and now it threatens Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation. An outbreak in Lagos, Africa's megacity where many live in cramped conditions, could be a major disaster. "Lagos is completely different from other cities because we're talking about millions of people," said Plan International's Disaster Response and Preparedness head, Dr Unni Krishnan. Nigerian newspapers describe the effort as a "scramble" to contain the threat after the Liberian arrived in Lagos and then died on Friday [25 Jul 2014].

International airports in Nigeria are screening passengers arriving from foreign countries for symptoms of EVD, according to Yakubu Dati, the spokesman for Federal Aviation Authority of Nigeria. Health officials are also working with ports and land borders, he said. "They are giving out information in terms of enlightenment, what to do, what to look out for." And Nigerian airports are setting up holding rooms to ready in case another potential EVD victim lands in Nigeria. Airports in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the 3 other West African countries affected by the current EVD outbreak, have implemented some preventive measures, according to officials in those countries. But none of the safeguards are foolproof, say health experts. Doctors say health screens could be effective, but EVD has a variable incubation period of between 2-21 days and cannot be diagnosed on the spot.

A consultant for the Liberian Ministry of Finance, initials PS, arrived in Nigeria on Tuesday [22 Jul 2014] and was immediately detained by health authorities suspecting he might have EVD, Plyler said. On his way to Lagos, PS's plane also stopped in Lome, Togo, according to WHO. Authorities announced on Friday [25 Jul 2014] that blood tests from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital confirmed PS died of EVD earlier that day. He reportedly did not show EVD symptoms when he boarded the plane, Plyler said, but by the time he arrived in Nigeria he was vomiting and had diarrhea. Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of EVD but are not being kept in isolation, said an employee at Nigeria's Ministry of Health, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press. PS's sister also died of EVD in Liberia, according to Liberian officials, but he claimed to have had no contact with her. EVD is highly contagious and kills [up to] 70 per cent of people infected [in this epidemic]. There is no "magic bullet" cure for EVD, but early detection and treatment with fluids and [nutritious foods] can be effective, said Plyler in Liberia. Quickly isolating patients who show symptoms is also crucial in slowing the spread of the disease.

West African hospital systems have weak and "often paralyzed" health care systems, he added, and are not usually equipped to handle EVD outbreaks. International aid organizations like his and Doctors Without Borders [Medecins sans Frontieres; MSF] have stepped in, but they also lack enough funding and manpower. "We need more humanitarian workers," he said. "We need resources."

[3] Nigeria: contact tracing
Date: Sun 27 Jul 2014
Source: Nursing World Nigeria, Sunday Newswatch report [edited]
http://www.nursingworldnigeria.com/2014/07/ebola-victim-rsquo-s-death-fg-lagos-launch-manhunt-for-co-passengers


Following the death of an Ebola virus disease victim from Liberia, PS, in Lagos [Nigeria], on Thursday [24 Jul 2014], the federal government and the Lagos state government have jointly launched a hunt for some of the passengers of the airplane that brought the late Liberian into the country, Sunday Newswatch has learnt.

The late PS, who was reported to have arrived in Nigeria last Sunday [20 Jul 2014] aboard a Liberian carrier, Asky Airline, was said to be in company of over 100 co-passengers of different nationalities, among whom were about 35 Nigerians. The 40 year old visiting Liberian died of the deadly virus after testing positive for the disease at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH).

According to sources in the federal Ministry of Health, the Nigerian co-passengers of the late Ebola victim were supposed to be quarantined for thorough investigations, based on an order placed by the federal government, but no sooner had the news broken out, than the suspected victims of the deadly virus took to their heels, after having been contacted by officials of the ministry. This prompted the federal government, in conjunction with the authorities in Lagos, to take the latest action and launch the hunt, categorising the alleged escapees as fugitives. Further investigations by Sunday Newswatch revealed that among them are 2 notable Nigerians, who live on a street in a vicinity categorised among the upper-end areas in Lagos.

A security personnel, who was among those detailed for the hunt, confided in Sunday Newswatch that a serious search had began, in order to fish out suspected Ebola virus patients, who might be on the run, and that there were specific instructions to move them to designated quarantined areas, as soon as they are seen. "We learnt that some of them are no longer staying in their houses, and that is why we are looking for them. They are not supposed to run; they should understand that government is only trying to help them. If they are tested and [found] positive, they will quickly attend to them. The government knows how to help them, but they are running like criminals, as if they would be jailed. But we must get them; we cannot allow them to mix with the people, and continue to spread the virus. It is very dangerous for the country," the source said.

When probed further on the modus operandi of the search operation, he revealed that the exercise is not only being conducted by the federal government, but that they have the support of the Lagos state government, which he claimed, has its personnel among the team looking for the escapees. "We are not doing it alone, even Lagos people are with us. Just this morning, they held a meeting with us, and they helped us in the areas to visit. We just came back from a big man's house. We went there with officials of Lagos, but the family said the man left for London yesterday. Though we don't believe them, we have told the airport people to check the manifest of all airlines that left for London yesterday (Friday [25 Jul 2014]). We need to confirm his whereabouts," he said.

The Lagos state government had earlier announced that it was trying to establish contact with those that travelled with the late PS on his way to Nigeria last Sunday [20 Jul 2014], so as to ascertain their status, and ensure that they are properly treated, while preventing spread of the disease. The state commissioner for health, Dr Jide Idris, who disclosed this after confirming the death of the Liberian on Friday [25 Jul 2014], said the hospital where the deceased died would also be cordoned off and sanitised, while explaining the need to properly dispose of the remains of the deceased. "We are dealing with those he had contact with. We have the manifest for questioning to ensure we screen them. We are doing that already. There is a protocol; we are talking with the hospital involved, the staff over there, after dealing with the body, we have to deal with the hospital, to sanitise the hospital, more importantly too, there is the need for us to do contact tracing. We are doing that with the World Health (Organization) people. We are going to trace all the contacts that the man came in with on the airplane, and where they went to. Since we have got the manifest now, we are going to trace all of them. Each one of them is going to be questioned, and there is a protocol to follow for questioning. They are going to be followed in the next 21 days to see if any of them develops any symptoms. This is what we are in the process of doing. We have been trying our best to contain the spread of the disease. We need to sanitise. We need to treat and dispose of the body properly. Those are the things we are working on right now. There are other processes and procedures we need to follow, which we are doing right now, and we are doing so in conjunction with the federal Ministry of Health," he said.

He also revealed that the Lagos state government, in conjunction with the federal government, had established contact with the Liberian government to resolve all diplomatic issues concerning the burial. "First and foremost, his body needs to be properly disposed. There are issues involving diplomatic relationship. We need to get consent from the Liberian government, which the federal Ministry for Health is doing right now. But we have to deal with the body and how to sanitise and ensure that the viruses are killed and prevented from spreading. These are the issues we are handling right now. That is the latest we can give you now," Idris had said on Friday [25 Jul 2014]. He further explained that governments at both levels were not leaving anything to chance. "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has stepped in to volunteer. The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) has also stepped in. We have set up contact screening centres. We have the Federal Ministry of Health assisting us with laboratory work. All stakeholders are involved. We are confident that the step[s] will stop further propagation of the disease. We plead that you do not spread scary messages, so as not to spread panic. If you know anybody who has travelled to Liberia where the viral disease is established, report to us on time. We have set up treatment centres for probable symptoms," he stated.

The minister of health, Prof Onyebuchi Chukwu, also assured Nigerians that there was no cause for alarm, assuring that necessary steps had been taken to control the spread of the virus, noting that all the passengers that the patient came in contact with aboard Asky Airline had been traced and are being investigated. "I want to reassure the general public that the federal Ministry of Health is presently working with other ministries, agencies and international organisations, as well as with the Lagos state government to prevent the possible spread of the virus."

US assistance
-------------
Meanwhile, the United States has said its officials are closely monitoring the outbreak of the deadly virus in Nigeria, and that it was working with the federal government and the Lagos state government, as well as aid groups, to try to stop the spread. "Our thoughts and prayers are with those fighting the virus," Will Stevens, spokesman for the State Department's Africa Bureau, said in an interview monitored on AFP, adding, "The USA will continue to provide a comprehensive, multi-agency response to assist countries affected."

[4] Sierra Leone: burial
Date: Sat 26 Jul 2014

http://reliefweb.int/report/sierra-leone/burying-ebola-s-victims-sierra-leone


Burying EVD's victims in Sierra Leone
-------------------------------------
They are all young men in their early 20s who, just a few short weeks ago, would have been studying, going to work at a construction site, or ferrying passengers around on their taxi motorbikes. Today, they are burying bodies, one after the other, sometimes up to 8 or 9 a day. This is how life has changed since the Ebola virus disease [EVD] arrived in Kailahun district, in eastern Sierra Leone. "Every day we are working. We don't have a day off and when we get to the site by 8:00 (in the morning), sometimes we get back to our homes around 2:00 [after] midnight," says Julius Tamba Kamanda, a 21 year old member of the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society dead body management team.

To date [26 Jul 2014], there have been more than 50 official burials, and with dozens of patients at the isolation centre, and more arriving every day, it is likely there will be more. "These are the deaths we have been informed about," says Daniel James, team leader of the Red Cross dead body management team. "More communities are beginning to notify authorities when someone passes away at home, which is great. Calling us and not touching the body will help us control this outbreak. However, there are still many other communities who do not believe EVD is real, and who continue with the local custom of preparing bodies for burial themselves."

The dead body management team oversees 2 types of burials. The bodies they receive from the case management centre are completely disinfected in advance [by the teams there], do not contain any trace of ebolavirus, and are therefore safe to handle without the full protective gear. "The family is contacted to determine where they would like their loved one buried, back in their community or in one of the newly dug gravesites here in Kailahun town, created just for Ebola victims," says James. "We are finding that most don't want their relatives returned, they are still so scared that the bodies are contagious."

The 2nd type of burial is more complicated and risky, as it involves the Red Cross dead body management team going into a community and preparing the body for burial. It may test positive for EVD, it may not, but the Red Cross team takes no chances. For their own protection, they wear all of their protective gear, from 3 sets of gloves to masks, goggles, coveralls and boots. "We have the personal protective equipment, the rope, we have the 2 sprayers. We have 6 in number (on the team)," explains Kamanda. "Whenever we have touched the diseased we have been sprayed by the sprayer so that we will be protected from the disease so that we don't bring it to our families." They disinfect repeatedly throughout the burial process, always placing the body in 2 body bags, to ensure there is absolutely no opportunity for the virus to survive. Any contaminated personal items such as clothing, blankets, and pillows are either burned or buried along with the body.

In a country where the majority of rural dwellers live on less than one dollar a day, volunteers on this team receive a daily per diem of 20 000 Leones (USD 5). "The money is nice," says Brima Swarray, who hopes to earn enough to return to school to study public health. "But, in all honesty, I would continue doing this even without the pay. We are helping our communities to kick Ebola out, and that is the most important."

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has increased its response to the EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone, revising an emergency appeal to provide support to the Sierra Leone Red Cross Society in assisting 6.3 million people who are at risk of being affected by the outbreak. Dead body management is a key component of the response, while other teams of volunteers focus on raising awareness about the disease, monitoring those who may have come into contact with an infected person, and providing psychosocial support to victims, their families, and communities.

[5] UK response

What is the British government doing to prevent the spread of Ebola to the UK?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ebola [virus disease] [EVD] has already killed more than 600 people in West Africa. It has been transmitted to Nigeria, brought by air by a passenger who has now died. So what measures are the UK government taking to prevent it reaching Britain? Public Health England confirms that there are no additional measures at the UK borders at present. There is no additional monitoring and no screening of passengers.

Dr Brian McCloskey, director of global health at Public Health England [PHE], said: "Public Health England is monitoring closely the continuing EVD outbreak in West Africa, the largest outbreak of this disease to date. It's clear the outbreak is not under control. The World Health Organization, with a range of technical partners including UNICEF, Medicins Sans Frontieres, and PHE, is intensifying its support and providing technical advice, personnel and supplies to the affected countries to help prevent community and healthcare facility spread of the virus. PHE staff, working with the UK's Department for International Development, continue on the ground in West Africa.

"The continuing increase in cases, especially in Sierra Leone, and the importation of a single case from Liberia to Nigeria, is a cause for concern as it indicates the outbreak is not yet under control. We will continue to assess the situation and provide support as required. The risk to UK travellers and people working in these countries of contracting Ebola is very low, but we have alerted UK medical practitioners about the situation in West Africa and requested they remain vigilant for unexplained illness in those who have visited the affected area."

"People who have returned from affected areas who have a sudden onset of symptoms such as fever, headache, sore throat and general malaise within 3 weeks of their return should immediately seek medical assistance -- but it is important to stress that no cases of imported EVD have ever been reported in the UK and the risk of a traveller going to West Africa and contracting EVD remains very low since EVD is transmitted by direct contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person."

[6] Tips for PPE users
Date: Sat 26 Jul 2014
From: Richard Brown <rexrocco@aol.com> [edited]


Suggestions re: ebolavirus, PPE and heat
----------------------------------------
Forgive me if I make some suggestions in regards to the problem of heat with use of PPE [personal protective equipment]. (The problem is additionally relevant as in the last 10 minutes of a 30-40 minute use, a person's judgment is reduced, literally it is more difficult to think coolly, and so one is tempted to take chances).

Here in Hong Kong when I go for a 10 km [about 6.2 mile] run lasting 50 to 55 minutes in 28-30 deg. C, well above 90 relative humidity, I presoak my vest in an ice water slurry. This makes an uncomfortable 1st 5 minutes, but a bearable last 20 minutes.

It might be worth trying to presoak T-shirts with ice slurry including disinfectant and red or blue dye if possible. This may reduce risk -- and if there is a significant tear in the PPE, reveal where the tear is. The T-shirt and shorts would be put in the ice slurry immediately prior to donning PPE. It is also worth considering placing and securing a flexible ice pack, cool -- not frozen -- and wrapped in cloth on the shoulders and back of neck. This may help to keep the head cool.

Finally, regarding gloves, when I was dealing with rabies or something nasty in the field, I used to 1st cover my hands with undiluted liquid iodine-based surgeon's disinfectant scrub -- my sweat would later dilute it. Then I would put on one pair of gloves. Next I would fill another pair of gloves with about 10 ml of spirit alcohol per glove. (I don't know if EVD is sensitive to this, but the principle is the same: create 2 fluid layers of different active disinfectants). This at least gave me a fighting chance against bone spicules, sharps [needles], etc.

I admire those out in the field [working] with EVD enormously; their courage is beyond belief.

Hopefully others have more suggestions.

[Case detection is accelerating: over 100 new cases in 2-3 days.

We have not been told whether the passenger who took EVD to Nigeria had symptoms during the stopover in Togo, had physical contact with any of the other people in the transit area, or used the lavatories, where he probably contaminated surfaces. On the plane, he must have used the lavatories since he had diarrhea, so I hope the cleaning crew used disposable gloves and did not touch their faces with them after cleaning. "Nearly 50 other passengers on the flight are being monitored for signs of EVD but are not being kept in isolation, said an employee at Nigeria's Ministry of Health, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press." (http://www.pressherald.com/2014/07/27/ebola-outbreak-takes-alarming-turn). If any of those should fall ill, each one would in turn produce many new contacts.

Many thanks to Dr Brown for his helpful suggestions about keeping a cool head while wearing PPE. When it takes 30 minutes to suit up and another 30 minutes for decontamination after a 30-40 minute stint as a health worker [HW] treating patients, a lot of sets of PPE are needed for the HWs caring for the 82 patients currently hospitalized as of 26 Jul 2014 at the EVD treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun, Sierra Leone (see ProMED-mail archive (103) below). - Mod.JW
