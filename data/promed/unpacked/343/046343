The epitheliotropic nature of the enteroviruses causing
hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is very similar to that of
foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). We have noted that areas of hoof
become separated in animals with FMDV infection, and that viral RNA
is detectable up to 5 weeks post infection by QRTPCR (quantitative
real time polymerase chain reaction) assay. Virus isolation and
standard gel-based PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay were all
negative from 7 days onward... Using a RT-qPCR (reverse
transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction), which has a
much shorter target amplicon (about 100 nucleotides), to detect
enterovirus sequences in nail specimens would be most likely to yield
a positive result if FMDV is anything to go by?

[This is an interesting observation that should be followed up by the
Finnish and Spanish groups who have raised the issue of a possible
connection between onychomadesis (loss of nails) and prior
hand-foot-mouth disease in children. Foot-and-mouth disease virus
affecting cattle and a variety of other animals, but not humans, and
the various enteroviruses associated with hand-foot-mouth disease in
children, are all epitheliotropic enteroviruses. However,
taxonomically the viruses are unrelated. Foot-and-mouth disease virus
is classified in the genus _Aphthovirus_, whereas all the
non-poliomyelitis enteroviruses associated with hand-foot-mouth
disease in children are classified in the genus _Enterovirus_.

The lapse of time between the signs and symptoms of hand-foot-mouth
disease and the subsequent occurrence of nail loss or damage has
frustrated attempts to confirm a specific linkage. It may be that the
application of more sensitive PCR technology, as demonstrated in the
case of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle, may confirm a linkage if
such exists. - Mod.CP]
