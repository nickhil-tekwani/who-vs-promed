More than half of the leprosy cases detected in Mumbai in 2011-12 comprised patients in their advanced stages. This has raised concerns of delayed detection of leprosy, said doctors.

The number of patients being detected with advanced stage of leprosy has increased by 7 per cent over the last year. Of the 709 leprosy cases reported in 2011-12, 399 cases were classified under the multibacillary (MB) category, which has a higher bacillary load, indicating a possibility of higher chances of spreading the infection.

According to the data collected by the Directorate of Health Services, Maharashtra, under the National Leprosy Elimination Program, the overall number of leprosy cases in the city has reduced marginally this year [2012] as 792 cases were detected in 2010-11.

However, doctors said that several patients in cities consult private doctors, who may not report the disease at all. "Patients tend to hide the disease because of the stigma attached to it. Hence we usually get lesser numbers in urban areas," said S Kingsley from Alert-India, an NGO working with leprosy patients.

In 2011-12, 11 per cent of the new cases were detected with visible lifetime deformity.

[Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years. Symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Although leprosy is not highly contagious, because patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions (that is, are multibacillary), a patient with untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for transmission of the infection to close, long-term contacts, such as household members. As the organism is also present in skin lesions in these patients, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection. Casual and short-term contact does not seem pose a risk for spread the disease.

Leprosy is treated with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine. These drugs are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

The WHO South East Asia Region (SEAR) that includes India achieved the elimination of leprosy as a public health problem (that is, a prevalence of less than one case per 10 000 population) in December 2005 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm); the Regional prevalence rate steadily declined from 4.6/10 000 population in 1996 to 0.82/10 000 population as of July 2006; and the Regional new case detection also declined from a peak of 47.8/100 000 in 1998 to 11.9/100 000 as of March 2006.

Between 1985 and 2005, more than 15 million leprosy cases were cured globally. Of these, about 12.8 million were from the SEA Region, of which India accounted for about 11.8 million (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm). The July 2006 prevalence rate in India was 0.88 per 10 000 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20_12162.htm). With a population of about 1.1 billion people, that means there are almost 100 000 patients reported with leprosy in India in 2006.

India, Brazil, and Indonesia are the 3 countries that have the greatest number of leprosy cases. The top 10 countries in new case detections in 2005 are India, Brazil, Indonesia, DR Congo, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mozambique, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Together, they constitute about 96 per cent of year 2005's global new case detections. The SEAR contributed about 69 per cent of 2005 global new case detections (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm).

WHO emphasizes that sustained political commitment and adequate resources for leprosy services are required, especially for currently under-served population groups such as remote rural areas, urban slums, migrant labor, to sustain elimination at national levels, and progress towards further reducing the burden of leprosy. Also strengthening integration of leprosy services into the general health system through capacity building and skill development is required to ensure and sustain quality leprosy services, including diagnosis and treatment and prevention/care of disabilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm).
