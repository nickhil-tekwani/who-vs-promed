The Iowa Department of Public Health [IDPH] reported Thursday [8 Aug 2013] that cases of cryptosporidiosis are growing across Iowa. Officials said 358 confirmed cases have been reported so far this year [2013] compared to 328 cases in all of last year [2012]. Some 272 cases occurred since [1 Jun 2013], with an additional 138 cases under investigation. Cases have been reported in nearly half of Iowa's 99 counties, officials said.

Cryptosporidiosis is a disease caused by [the _Cryptosporidium_] parasite that results in watery diarrhea and can include nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps and low grade fever. People get cryptosporidiosis by coming in contact with persons or animals shedding the parasite, or by drinking water contaminated with the parasite.

Officials said many of the people who have become ill with cryptosporidiosis reported swimming in pools, and some in lakes or rivers.

"The most effective way to keep swimming waters healthy is by keeping unhealthy people out of them," said IDPH Medical Director, Dr. Patricia Quinlisk, in a news release issued Thursday [8 Aug 2013]. "If you or your child is or has recently been sick with diarrhea, don't go swimming."

[An outbreak in several places that do not share a common water supply source can only be explained by a food source. An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis was reported from the UK in March 2013 (see below) caused by contaminated lettuce. It is probably a coincidence that this outbreak comes at the same time as the US multi-state outbreak of cyclospora. So far there is no information that links the 2 outbreaks, but both cyclospora and cryptosporidia can contaminate food if fecal material is used as a fertilizer. Case-control studies are needed to identify risk factors for infection. - Mod.EP
