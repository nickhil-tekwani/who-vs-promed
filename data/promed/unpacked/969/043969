I would be grateful for the opportunity to clarify some of the points in
your report below.
1. On 24 Jan 2006, BSE was confirmed in 2 cattle from a Somerset herd.
These cattle were detected under the compulsory targeted (active)
surveillance programme, an aspect of which requires the UK to test all
fallen cattle aged over 24 months, for BSE.
2. The 2 animals did not have cattle passports and it is impossible to
verify their dates of birth.
3. Provisional figures indicate that of the 156 cattle slaughtered as BSE
suspects in Great Britain in 2005, only 39 were subsequently confirmed with
the disease. A further 160 BSE cases were detected by the 2005 targeted
surveillance programme (4 cases pending) in which over 551 000 cattle were
tested.
4. Of the approximately 200 BSE cases confirmed in Great Britain in 2005,
only 28 cases (1 case pending) were born after July 1996 (after which the
UK's 1996 ban on the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to farmed
livestock is considered effective).
5. To date, only 122 BSE cases confirmed in Great Britain were born after
July 1996. To put this in context, over 180 000 BSE cases confirmed in
Great Britain were born before July 1996.
In summary, the number of cases of BSE in cattle in the UK is declining
sharply every year, and the incidence is particularly low in cattle born
after July 1996.

[Dr Burke's clarification is very much appreciated. It is indeed
encouraging to note that the UK BSE numbers are sharply declining.
The age distribution of UK's BAB (born after ban) cases will help in the
assessment of the current situation there. In the absence of passports,
could the age of affected cattle be estimated by other (traditional) means?
