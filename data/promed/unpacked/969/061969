Swine Fever Report 4 Dec 2000
---------------------------------
I am writing to correct a report on UK Classical Swine fever dated 4 Dec
2000. There is NOT a suspected case in Copdock. This report came about
after a misunderstanding with the journalist concerned, which has also been
corrected. If you need further information, please let me know.
