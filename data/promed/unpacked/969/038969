As to the vaccination considerations: for years I have been discussing and re-evaluating the aspect of including a time frame (may it be one stay or repetitive travels to endemic areas) into the decision making process: it simply makes no sense.

Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a (very) rare disease in travelers and there is no significant difference in between those who stay once or frequently, shorter or longer.

If the recommendations cited were applied half of the proven cases in travelers would not have been vaccinated -- this is like flipping a coin. Based on the fact that the infected mosquito simply does not ask: "How long are you already here?" or "Is it your 1st visit to this area?" before she bites and infects I would really ask the travel medicine community for support to impact national and international bodies responsible for official trail medicine advice with the goal of having a harmonized approach, which "allows" vaccination of those who want the shots no matter how long the stay, as well as taking the risk without vaccination in those who stay longer (for example, by applying the principle of guided self-responsibility).

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Haditsch for his thought-stimulating comments. Relative risk of exposure to JE virus will vary from country to country, within a country (cities versus countryside where vector mosquitoes and avian hosts may be abundant), and the season of the year transmission season versus no transmission). The recommendation for vaccination a month or more before travel is not clear, since an immune response will occur before that time. One hopes that Dr Haditsch's points will be the basis for re-evaluation of JE virus vaccination recommendations. - Mod.TY
