Tulare man has West Nile virus
---------------------------
A 47-year-old Tulare County man has become the 1st person in
California to test positive for West Nile virus this year [2005],
state health officials announced late Wednesday.

The California case is only the 2nd reported in the nation for 2005,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site.
A Kansas man died from the disease one week ago.

The Tulare County man sought medical care for fever and headache in
early June and is recovering, according to the state Department of
Health Services.

So far this year, the virus has been detected in 34 of the state's 58
counties, mostly in dead birds. Last year [2004], the state logged
830 human cases of the disease, including 28 deaths.

Citing the region's mild winter, excessive rainfall and warm weather,
state health officials have predicted that the virus will hit the
Central Valley hard this year.

West Nile virus is transmitted through mosquito bites. Mosquitoes
become infected when they feed on infected birds. 80 percent of
people infected will not experience any symptoms, which include
headache, fever, and muscle aches. Only one percent of those infected
will experience the most serious consequences of the illness,
including encephalitis or meningitis.

Health officials are urging California residents to take precautions
against mosquito bites, including wearing insect repellent containing
DEET, picaradin, or oil of lemon eucalyptus; eliminating sources of
standing water; and keeping doors and windows well-screened.

Maricopa County sees its 1st West Nile case of '05
------------------------------------------------
A man in his 50s who contracted West Nile virus is the 1st human case
confirmed in Arizona in 2005, Maricopa County health officials said
yesterday.

The man, whose name was not released, was treated for mild symptoms
and did not require hospitalization, Doug Campos-Outcalt, the
county's chief health officer, said in a news release.

The man is from Mesa, but that doesn't necessarily mean he contracted
the disease there, said Emily Poland, a spokeswoman for the county
Public Health Department.

Officials were sure, however, he contracted the virus in Arizona,
they said. 4/5 of people infected with the virus show no symptoms.
The other 1/5 can develop flu-like symptoms, and in rare cases, the
virus progresses to life-threatening encephalitis or meningitis.

There were 355 human cases of West Nile in 2004 in the county,
including 14 people who died.

West Nile Reported
-----------------
2 people from Larimer and Weld counties recently contracted West Nile
virus, the 1st reported cases of the illness in Colorado in 2005,
according to state health officials.

A 17-year-old Fort Collins boy got sick on 5 Jun 2005 and was
hospitalized overnight. He has recovered, according to the Larimer
County Department of Health and Environment.

A 50-year-old Weld County woman developed fever 24 May 2005 from a
West Nile virus infection. She was not hospitalized, according to
officials from the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment.

The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that have bitten
infected birds, said Douglas Benevento, executive director of the
state health department.

Colorado is the 3rd state this summer to report human infections.
Earlier this month, Kansas reported 2 cases, and South Dakota has
reported 3 cases in the past several days, Benevento said.

Last year [2004], Colorado had 291 reported human cases of West Nile
virus, including 4 deaths. The number had dropped significantly from
2003, when 2947 people got sick and 63 died.

Health officials use a blood test to determine if a person has been
infected. Most people who catch the virus never get sick or have only
mild symptoms. However, it can develop into more serious illnesses,
including encephalitis or meningitis, health officials said.
Symptoms include fever, headache and body aches, skin rashes and
swollen lymph nodes.

Local health officials urged people to protect themselves by wearing
insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or lemon eucalyptus.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently added the latter 2
to its list of approved mosquito repellents.

State reports 2 cases of West Nile Virus
--------------------------------------
The New Mexico Health Department announced Thursday that it has
confirmed the 1st 2 cases of West Nile Virus in the state in 2005.

The department reports that a 44-year-old Bernalillo County man has
contracted a mild form of the infection, while a 37-year-old Valencia
County man has been hospitalized with a more invasive form of the
disease.

The health department also reports that mosquito control officials in
Dona Ana County have collected mosquitoes in Sunland Park that tested
positive for West Nile. The illness is spread through mosquito bites.

In 2003, New Mexico experienced its 1st case of West Nile Virus in
May and ended the year with a total of 209 laboratory-confirmed
cases. A year later [2004], the disease was also first confirmed in
May, but there were only 88 confirmed cases.

"West Nile is one of the few diseases where people can take some
simple precautions, such as using repellent when outdoors, and be
protected," said New Mexico Secretary of Health Michelle Lujan
Grisham. She says it is especially important to avoid mosquito
contact as the summer increases and the mosquito population grows.

"West Nile Virus can cause flu-like symptoms, such as fever, nausea,
headache and muscle aches," said Paul Ettestad, the state public
health veterinarian. "People over the age of 50 are at most risk for
serious disease from West Nile Virus."

West Nile can develop into meningitis and encephalitis, both of which
can be fatal, especially in the elderly. Fewer than one percent of
people infected with West Nile develop meningitis, which is an
infection of the brain lining, or encephalitis, which is an infection
of the brain itself.

Another bird in Ouachita Parish has tested positive for West Nile
virus. The bird was found in the Swartz area.

The board of the parish's mosquito abatement agency met to approve a
bid for aerial spraying. Director Cole Church says mosquito counts
this season have been relatively low, but they're taking no chances.
Church says a stronger insecticide is being used this year to further
reduce the mosquito population.

The mosquito abatement district monitors how well the insecticides
are working every year. Church says this year the insecticide wasn't
working quite as well as the board had hoped so the dosage was
increased.

The board also talked about hiring a new biologist for the mosquito
abatement office. So far in 2005 no human cases of West Nile have
been reported, but birds and mosquitoes carrying the virus show up
year-round in Louisiana.

Last year [2004] there were 84 cases of encephalitis or meningitis
and 24 cases of West Nile.

[This update carries most reports of West Nile disease since January
2005. We will continue to report infected birds and mosquitoes when
they first occur in new areas each year or if there is unusual
activity. As West Nile virus (WNV) circulates between mosquitoes and
birds, and humans are the bystanders and innocent dead-end hosts.
Vigilance over WNV-infected mosquitoes and birds is essential for
control and prevention of this seasonal epidemic. - Mod.RY]
