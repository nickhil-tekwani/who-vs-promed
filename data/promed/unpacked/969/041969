ANTHRAX VACCINE PRODUCTION TO END - MICHIGAN, USA
*************************************************

The nation's last, state-owned vaccine lab and the only licensed maker of
anthrax vaccine for the military is for sale. The State of Michigan says it
has placed an advertisement in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal announcing the
sale of the 71-year-old Michigan Biologic Products Institute.
The State Legislature ordered the sale of the institute's 27 buildings,
including labs and manufacturing facilities, to the highest bidder this year.
The Lansing facility has 153 workers and will post sales of about $18 million
this year.
The institute has a long history of supporting the U.S. military through
several wars, providing blood products as well as [vaccines] against
pertussis, rabies, tetanus and other diseases. But it has lost between $1
million and $6 million a year since 1993.
Dennis Schornack, who heads a commission overseeing the sale, says private
ownership would give the Institute "the best chance to survive." He adds
"The government experiment has not worked out." Fifty years ago, about a
dozen states operated labs that made vaccines or blood products but
competition, costs and the difficulty in keeping trade secrets doomed those
labs.
The institute was honored by the Pentagon for its production of anthrax
vaccines during the Persian Gulf War. It still makes the vaccine, as well as
plasma and pediatric and rabies vaccines.
Institute workers have formed a company that will enter the bidding.
Schornack says two other groups also have shown strong interest. He won't
say how much the state expects to get.

[Given how long it takes governments to do anything, a 71-year experiment
would not be surprising. Nonetheless, I believe "experiment" is not the
right word. If Michigan Biologic Products Institute was the only licensed
producer of anthrax vaccine for the military, where will the military now
obtain its anthrax vaccine? -- Mod CHC]
