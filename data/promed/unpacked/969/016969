The federal government will begin a nationwide vaccination against yellow fever by December [2017], the Minister of Health, Isaac Adewole has said.

Mr. Adewole who briefed state house correspondents after the Federal Executive Council meeting on [Wed 11 Oct 2017] said the intended vaccination is as a result of the current outbreak of yellow fever which started in Kwara state last month [September 2017].

The minister, while giving the report on the public health situation in the country said so far, the country has recorded 10 cases of yellow fever this year: 4 cases in Kwara state, 2 in Kogi, 2 in Plateau, one in Abia and one in Edo state.

He said the ministry will start a campaign in Kwara and Kogi starting from [Fri 13 Oct 2017]. "We have also decided to start a nationwide vaccination [campaign] against yellow fever, we are going to bring that forward to December [2017] because of what is currently ongoing. We quite recognise the fact that we have a large number of Nigerians who are not immune to yellow fever and so we want to do a nationwide vaccination against yellow fever, he said.

Mr. Adewole on the status of yellow fever in the country said there had been no report of new confirmed cases of the disease.

[This report clarifies the current yellow fever (YF) case numbers and their localities. YF cases are more wlde-spread than reported in previous reports. Although the numbers of cases is not large, because, as the Minister indicated, a large number of Nigerians have not been vaccinated, the risk of an urban outbreak is significant. Health authorities are wise in initiating a YF vaccination campaign promptly. Urban YF can spread rapidly. Carrying out a nation-wide vaccination campaign is a formidable undertaking.
