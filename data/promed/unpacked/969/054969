FUNGAL DISEASES, CEREALS - AUSTRALIA: (EASTERN, SOUTH) ALERT

Croppers throughout the eastern seaboard and into South Australia are
being urged to vigilantly monitor their cereal crops this year [2011]
with warnings for fungal disease.

Grant Hollaway, DPI [Department of Primary Industries] Victoria, said
good disease management would be vital in preventing losses. Risks
have increased dramatically due to the wet summer, which has provided
a 'green bridge' of volunteer cereals for the diseases to survive on.

Dr Hollaway said it could be the worst year for fungal diseases since
stem rust decimated crops in 1973. Stem rust is again a threat, with
some cases recorded in 2010 for the 1st time in a long while. Wheat
producers will also be watching for stripe rust which has been more of
a problem in recent years. Stubble-borne disease, such as yellow leaf
spot in wheat and scald in barley will also potentially be an issue.

Dr Hollaway urged growers to remove volunteer cereals, avoid growing
susceptible cultivars, avoid early sowing, and apply fungicides to
seed or at sowing and to crops before the diseases reach high levels.

"Rains have provided some of the best subsoil moisture levels in
years but they also increase the risk of diseases, so every effort
must be made now and during the season to reduce this pressure," Dr
Hollaway said.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 70 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is the Ug99 group of strains which have
overcome the major resistance genes used in our current wheat
varieties. However, none of the Ug99 strains are at this time present
in Australia.

Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. New stripe rust strains with increased
virulence are emerging. Early infections cause more serious damage to
plants and therefore pose an increased risk to crop yields.

Tan spot (also called yellow leaf spot or blotch) is caused by the
fungus _Pyrenophora tritici-repentis_. It affects wheat but can also
attack barley, triticale, rye, and some grasses. Tan spot may cause
yield losses of up to 50 percent in favourable environments,
especially under minimum tillage systems which are widely used in
Australia.

Scald (or leaf blotch) caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of
the most destructive diseases of barley, particularly in wet
conditions. It can decrease yield by up to 40 percent and reduces
grain quality. The pathogen can also cause symptomless seed infection
resulting in a high risk of spread.

Hot spots of these diseases usually appear in crops before widespread
outbreaks occur. Disease management therefore mostly relies on crop
monitoring for timely fungicide applications, as well as use of cereal
cultivars with reduced susceptibility or increased resistance. For
more information on the diseases see links and previous ProMED-mail
posts listed below.
