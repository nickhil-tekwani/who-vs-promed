Wild Dogs Spread Fear in Kerio Valley
-----------------
Impoverished by decades of cattle rustling, Kerio Valley residents of
Marakwet District now live under the mercy of yet another nightmare
-- marauding wild dogs.
For the last month, stray dogs have been terrorizing residents of Tot
division in the district, with so far 39 having been bitten by the
wild dogs.
A 70-year-old victim said the dogs were left behind by villagers when
they fled the valley to seek refugee in highland areas because of
insecurity, and have now turned against their former domesticators.
The victim said he has seen such a scenario in the last 70 years he
has lived in the area.
Village people say those attacked and bitten by the stray dogs lose
consciousness for a periods of close to 5 hours before regaining
their memory.
Area MP and Assistant Minister for Finance Mr John Marirmoi has
expressed shock over the attacks and called on the Government to
intervene. Marirmoi said the Government should round up and poison
all stray dogs in the area to check further attacks on local
residents.
Marakwet District Commissioner (DC) Christopher Maithya, who toured
Endo Hospital to console the victims, said a major vaccination
exercise has been launched in Tirap division where the stray dogs are
said to be found in high numbers.
Maithya directed residents with dogs to ensure they were vaccinated,
adding that they have to assist medical personnel in identifying the
stray dogs. The DC said the vaccination exercise was likely to take a
month before the whole district is covered.
Villagers said all the stray dogs have 3 teeth on the upper jaw and
two on the lower one.
The local District Medical Officer of Health (MOH) Dr Robert Pukose
said vaccination will target over 3000 stray dogs in the entire
district. Pukose said the species of the dogs was yet to be
established, but added some of his officers were on the ground to
establish the facts. He urged those who have been attacked by the
dogs to seek immediate treatment at the nearest health center, adding
that rabies was a very serious disease.
More drugs for the treatment of rabies, he said, will be supplied to
local hospitals to cater for those who might be attacked by the dogs
before the end of the vaccination period.
"The Government recognizes the vital role played by Endo Mission
Hospital in the provision of medical facilities to thousands of
residents along the Kerio Valley," said Maithya at the facility.
The sister in charge of Endo Mission Hospital, Maria Hull, where all
the 39 patients have been treated, said the latest 6 victims were
treated on 22 May 2002 and discharged. Hull described the situation
as epidemic, saying if urgent measures will not be taken to eliminate
all stray dogs in the area, the situation was likely to get out of
control.
Hull said the hospital was offering affected victims free treatment
because they are unable to raise the required medical charges.
"Each of the 39 victims has been given an anti-rabies injection.
However, we fear for those who may be attacked since we have
exhausted our stock of drugs," said Hull.
Interviewed villagers expressed fear for their lives, saying everyone
was living under fear of being attacked by the stray dogs. Victims of
the dog attacks thanked Hull for her assistance in offering them free
treatment.
The Catholic priest in charge of Endo parish, Father Richard Kimosop,
described the situation as serious and also called on the Government
to urgently intervene.
"When dogs which had never been seen in an area like this go on
rampage attacking people, the matter should be treated with a lot of
seriousness by the concerned authorities," said Kimosop.
