AVIAN INFLUENZA, POULTRY VS MIGRATORY BIRDS (32): EUROPE

A couple of points regarding ProMED-Mail post number: 20070817.2695,
Avian influenza, poultry vs migratory birds (31): Europe
-------------------------
1) This is a very interesting post. I share the author(s) view that
many introductions of HPAI H5N1 virus are via domestic poultry and
that extensive sampling of healthy free living wildbirds has failed
to show a reservoir of infection.
But I think there are some occasions where no good source from
domestic poultry can be found, which, regrettably (I am a birdwatcher
and don't want to add to the persecution of wildbirds) would then
only leave wild birds as a source. But which species? Is it possible
that we are looking in the wrong species of wild birds? Is it
possible that the virus could be circulating at some level in species
of birds which are found across much of Asia and Europe, such as
pigeons, quail or partridges? There might then be occasional spill
over into domestic poultry, and in particular in areas where backyard
poultry are commoner because they are more likely to come into
contact with these species. There may also be times of the year when
this is more likely to occur, which might explain some of the
seasonality. I would be very happy to be shot down in flames about
this idea, because, as I say, I am personally in no hurry to blame
wild birds. But I think it might be worth this being considered, if
only to rule it out.
2) Regarding the moderator's comment on Turkey: I wasn't there at the
time, only later, but so far as I understand it, the outbreak in
turkeys in October 2006 in Turkey was a flock of free-ranging
turkeys, kept in a village, not part of a commercial company. Hence
it was described as a backyard flock.

[Nature is illiterate and doesn't read the literature. So while ducks
and other aquatic environment birds are traditionally the major hosts
for LPAI infections, and by extension for wildlife HPA infections, I
am sure we haven't exhausted the species' potential for other
meaningful wildlife infections, whether or no they play any
meaningful part in the epidemiology of this disease. Suggestions are
welcome.
On the other hand I am reminded of starlings which hang out in large
black wheeling flocks. To quote my good friend LP Smith it was no
wonder that they were accused of spreading FMD, they were black. They
also rode in on the same winds that brought FMD from the Continent to
England which is why they were first falsely identified as a "risk."
But could they not be involved in AI infections? They feed in one
place and will roost at another some miles away, and theoretically
capable of being a transmitter species. I doubt whether quail or
partridges play any useful part because of their niche being distant
from backyard or commercial poultry. - Mod.MHJ]
[Nick Honhold's remark regarding the outbreak in Turkey in October
2005 (not 2006) is right. According to the official Turkish
notification, the outbreak involved 1800 turkeys kept outdoors "in a
sparsely populated area (military zone) between Kiziksa and Salur
villages in Manyas district, Balikesir province which is situated in
the north-western part of Marmara region." The notification added
that "in the protection zone, apart from the animals that had died in
the outbreak, 2684 backyard turkeys kept outdoors and 2200 backyard
poultry and other domestic birds (chickens, ducks, pigeons, etc.)
were killed and destroyed."
The possible spread of H5N1 following the African/west Asian and
Black Sea/Mediterranean flyway of migratory birds was studied in a
recent paper by Ducatez et al. (2007), Molecular and antigenic
evolution and geographical spread of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian
influenza viruses in western Africa. Journal of General Virology, 88,
2297-2306. Available online at:
<http://jgv.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/88/8/2297>. (see
archived 20070729.2432). One of the authors' conclusions was that the
geographical origin of west African HPAI H5N1 was not south-east Asia
but the central Asian/European region. It would be useful to include
in such investigations the H5N1 isolates from Turkey and Israel. -
