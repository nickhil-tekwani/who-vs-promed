A total of 31 people have been sickened by salmonellosis at 4 health care facilities in southeastern Pennsylvania. A majority of those cases occurred after individuals ate pre-cut fruit from New Jersey-based Tailor Cut Produce. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the salmonellosis outbreak in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) on [Fri 6 Dec 2019]. The North Brunswick distributor has recalled its fruit mix with cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple and grapes as a result.

Tailor Cut Produce reports that its products may be found in restaurants, banquet facilities, hotels, schools and institutional food service establishments in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York. "We recommend that any facility who use Tailor Cut Produce pre-cut fruit to immediately stop and throw it away," Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said.

Salmonellosis is an infection caused by _Salmonella_ bacteria that generally affects the intestinal tract. People usually become infected by either eating or drinking contaminated food or water, by contact with infected people or animals, or through contact with contaminated environmental sources.

FDA and the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) are investigating an outbreak of illnesses caused by _Salmonella_ Javiana in Pennsylvania. Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate that fruit mix with cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, and grapes from Tailor Cut Produce of North Brunswick, New Jersey, are a potential source of this outbreak.

Recommendation
--------------
Food service and institutional food operators should not sell or serve the fruit mix with cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, and grapes prepared by Tailor Cut Produce.

Tailor Cut Produce reports that their products may be found in restaurants, banquet facilities, hotels, schools and institutional food service establishments in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Because this fruit mix may have been distributed to nursing homes, schools, hospitals and other facilities that cater to vulnerable populations, it is important that these facilities do not sell or serve this fruit medley. Please consult with your distributor to confirm the source of the fruit mix used in your operation.

Background
----------
The Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) reports that it is investigating 31 laboratory-confirmed illnesses of _Salmonella_ at 4 healthcare facilities in southeast Pennsylvania. _Salmonella_ Javiana has been identified among cases at 3 of 4 facilities. According to the Pennsylvania DOH the epidemiologic evidence collected thus far indicates that this fruit mix is a potential source of the illnesses. The state's review of invoices shows that a common food eaten by many case patients was the fruit mix with cantaloupe, honeydew, pineapple, and grapes from Tailor Cut Produce.

FDA has activated a team to coordinate its outbreak investigation. On [6 Dec 2019], the FDA and the Pennsylvania DOH shared the results of the investigation thus far with the firm, and the firm's leadership stated that they would work with FDA to implement a recall of this product.

FDA will continue its investigation and provide updates as more information becomes available.

[The fruit was likely contaminated in production. Salmonellosis can be a more severe disease in the elderly and infirmed. There is no patient information given but seemingly no fatalities. - Mod.LL
