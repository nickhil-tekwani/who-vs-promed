In recent hours, the Institute of Public Health confirmed also that a 41 year old farm worker who died on 17 March [2012] suspected of [a] hantavrus [infection] had the virus when he lost his life in the Herminda Martin de Chillan Hospital. This was stated by the BioBio Health SEREMI Boris Oportus.

The 2nd case in the region, a 61 year old man, was infected in Niguen and was interned in the Davila Clinic, was taken to the Santa Maria Clinic in Santiago, where he progresses well, according to to health authorities. Meanwhile, an epidemiological team of the Nuble SEREMI carries out an investigation to establish the circumstances of the infection.

[The hantavirus involved in all of these cases has not been specified, but is most likely to be Andes virus. The long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_) is the reservoir host of Andes virus, and people are exposed to the virus through contact with excrement and urine of these infected rodents. Chilean health professionals have reduced the case fatality rate to approximately 35 per cent, a significant improvement but still high due to the rapid progression of pulmonary and cardiac distress.
