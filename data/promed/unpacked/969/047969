The China National Health and Family Planning Commission that 18 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), including 2 deaths, were recorded from 17-23 Mar 2017.

The 11 male and 7 female patients, aged from 37 to 86, had their onset [of illness] from [9-15 Mar 2017]. The cases were 5 cases from Guangxi, 4 cases in Hunan, 2 cases each from Hubei and Zhejiang, and one case each from Anhui, Fujian, Guizhou, Henan, and Jiangxi. Among them, 16 were known to have exposure to poultry or poultry markets.

According to the Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP), as of [18 Mar 2017], 1329 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported since 2013.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks, according to the CHP. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death.

People mainly become infected with avian influenza through close contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings. Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian flu. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[2] Guangxi update
Date: Sat 25 Mar 2017

The number of H7N9 infection cases in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has risen to 20 in 2017, including 7 fatalities, local authorities said [Fri 24 Mar 2017]. The region reported 3 new infections and 3 fatalities from [17 to 23 Mar 2017], according to the regional health and family planning commission.

H7N9 was first reported in humans in China in March 2013 and is most likely to strike in winter and spring. Disease control and prevention experts have said that the H7N9 virus cannot be transmitted from person to person. Experts recommend that people avoid contact with dead and live poultry, and only buy poultry with quarantine certificates.

[The latest wave of A/H7N9 human cases is a cause for vigilance, continued monitoring and surveillance activities for affected poultry as well as suspected human cases. This will help detect and initiate control measures at the earliest. - Mod.UBA
