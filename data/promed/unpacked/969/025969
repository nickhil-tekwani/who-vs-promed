Indonesia: pregnant woman treated with Tamiflu
----------------------------------------------
A pregnant woman in Indonesia with symptoms of avian influenza agreed to
receive Tamiflu (oseltamivir). The medicine, recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO) to treat the lethal virus, may be a risk to her
unborn fetus, a doctor said. The 35 year old woman, 2 months pregnant,
began a course of Roche Holding AG's antiviral to treat an infection
possibly caused by the H5N1 avian influenza [virus], said Luhur Soeroso, a
doctor at the Adam Malik Hospital in Medan on Sumatra island.
Clinicians have had little experience treating H5N1 in pregnant women, and
if the woman has the disease, her case may provide needed information.
There is no adequate data on the use of Tamiflu in pregnant women,
according to WHO. Animal studies don't indicate direct or indirect harmful
effects on pregnancy or fetal development, the health agency said in March
[2006]. "Our priority is to save her life," Soeroso said. The woman is
aware of the unknown risks [to] her fetus caused by oseltamivir and by the
antibiotics she is also taking, he said.
H5N1 avian influenza virus is known to have infected 241 people in 10
countries during the past 3 years, killing 141 of them. WHO recommends that
in patients with confirmed or strongly suspected H5N1 infection, doctors
should give oseltamivir as soon as possible. The recommendation applies to
adults, including pregnant women and children, the health agency said in
guidelines for the medical treatment of H5N1 cases, released in May [2006].
There has been "no evidence of a significant risk of fetal abnormalities"
caused by Tamiflu treatment during pregnancy, based on clinical trials and
post-marketing surveillance, said Alexander Klauser, a spokesman for Roche
in Basel, Switzerland. "The majority of women who have taken Tamiflu during
pregnancy have given birth to a healthy baby," Klauser said in an email on
Friday [25 Aug 2006]. "However, given that there are no well-controlled
studies in pregnant women, Tamiflu should not be used during pregnancy
unless the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to
the fetus."
In the face of a deadly disease such as H5N1, the "risk of oseltamivir in
pregnancy would become insignificant," said K Y Yuen, head of the
Microbiology Department at the University of Hong Kong.

[The high mortality rate associated with human cases of H5N1 avian
influenza in Indonesia (76.7 per cent) compared with the global figure of
58.5 per cent further justifies the use of Tamiflu to protect the mother in
the absence of any reliable evidence of a detrimental effect of oseltamivir
on an unborn child. The downside, however, is that the diagnosis of avian
influenza virus infection in this patient has still to be confirmed, and
Tamiflu may not be appropriate for her condition. - Mod.CP]

Thailand: avian influenza human disease situation in 2006
-------------------------------------------
From 1 Jan 2006 to 26 Aug 2006, the Bureau of Epidemiology has received
reports of influenza or pneumonia cases in the Avian Influenza Surveillance
Network from Provincial Health Offices and Disease Prevention and Control
Regional Offices. The investigation and analysis can be summarized as
follows: Cumulative number of patients under surveillance has totaled 4434
cases located throughout 71 provinces. [Thailand is subdivided into 75
provinces. - Mod.CP]
A total of 33 cases have been reported today [Sat 26 Aug 2006]: 10 cases
from the province of Loei, 3 each from Sukhothai, Phitsanulok, and
Uthaithani, 2 each from Nonthaburi, Angthong, Nakhonpathom,
Prachaubkirikhan, Nakhonsawan, and Phichit, and one each from Bangkok
metropolis, and Uttharadit.
There have been 2 confirmed cases of avian influenza (both fatal) during
2006 up to the present. One of these was a 17 year old male. He became ill
on 15 Jul 2006 and died on 24 Jul 2006. The other case was a 27 year old
male reported from the Sawang Arom district of Uthai Thani province. He
became ill on 24 Jul 2006 and died on 3 Aug 2006. Results for 74 suspected
cases are pending.
Conclusions: (1) In 2005, there are 5 confirmed human cases of avian
influenza, with 2 fatalities. (2) In 2006, there are 2 confirmed human
cases of avian influenza, both fatal.
