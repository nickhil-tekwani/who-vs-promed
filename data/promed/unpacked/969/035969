19 mule deer have tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in
Saskatchewan since testing resumed in the fall of 2003 -- almost double the
previous year's total -- signalling that the disease may be spreading.

Joe Warbeck, a Saskatchewan Environment business manager who works on the
CWD file, said 18 of the infected deer were found near the herd reduction
area at Saskatchewan Landing provincial park, 50 kilometres north of Swift
Current. The other was found in a "high priority" area around Paradise
Hill, near Lloydminster.

The problem, Warbeck said, is that about 1/3 of the deer were found outside
the boundaries of the Saskatchewan Landing herd reduction area -- 1 of 3
zones in the province where CWD has been found in wild deer. Saskatchewan
Environment issues special collection permits to hunters in these areas on
the condition that deer heads are sent in for testing.

CWD-infected animals were found in an 80-km range along the South
Saskatchewan River. "We're finding (deer with CWD) outside the herd
reduction area around Sask. Landing for one of 2 reasons: One, we're
looking for it more, and 2, it could very well be spreading," Warbeck said.

CWD is a brain-wasting disease found in deer and elk that is similar to mad
cow disease [BSE, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy] and [variant]
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. It gradually eats away at an animal's
brain, causing uncharacteristic behavior and eventually leading to death.
It is not known exactly how the disease is transmitted. The only way to
detect CWD is to test the animal's brain stem.

Since Saskatchewan began testing in 1997, 31 cases of CWD have been
confirmed, 10 of which were detected in 2002. The department is waiting for
more than 200 more test results from 2003.

Warbeck said any changes to the surveillance program would be finalized after
all the results are in and the provincial government sets the budget. But
Darrell Crabbe of the Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation said the government
needs to scrap its current strategy in favour of a systematic, total
eradication. "Obviously the major way to control it is to eradicate the hot
zones," he said.
