The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) received reports of 2 human infections with novel influenza A viruses recently, one in Wisconsin and one in Minnesota.

The Wisconsin case was hospitalized as a result of their illness with H1N2v and continues to recover. Direct contact with swine in the week preceding illness onset was reported. No ongoing community transmission has been detected.

In April 2016, an individual from Minnesota was infected with an H1N2v virus. The patient was not hospitalized and has fully recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission has been identified, and the case reported close contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset.

Pigs are commonly infected with swine influenza ("variant flu") viruses that are usually different from human influenza viruses. While rare, influenza can spread from pigs to people and from people to pigs.

Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses."

In general, the severity of illnesses associated with variant influenza have been similar to seasonal influenza. Influenza symptoms come on quickly in the form of fever, dry cough, sore throat, headache, extreme tiredness, stuffed-up nose, and body aches. Young children and the elderly may not develop fever. These symptoms can be severe and put you in bed for several days.

To date, there is no sustained human-to-human transmission of novel swine-origin flu. However, influenza viruses have the capacity to change, and it is possible that this virus may become widespread. It is not transmissible by eating properly handled and prepared pork (pig meat) or other products derived from pigs.

[Swine flu viruses do not normally infect humans. However, sporadic human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine and not people have occurred. When this happens, these viruses are called "variant viruses." They also can be denoted by adding the letter "v" to the end of the virus subtype designation. Human infections with H1N1v, H3N2v and H1N2v viruses have been detected in the United States. (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant.htm).

As influenza viruses that infect pigs might be different from human influenza viruses, influenza vaccines made against human influenza viruses are generally not expected to protect people from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs.

Three H1N2v cases were reported in Minnesota in 2013, all of them in people who were exposed to pigs at a state fair. The viruses were described as the 1st H1N2v isolates known to contain the matrix gene from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. A few other H1N2v cases have been reported in earlier years, including one in Michigan in 2007 and one each in Minnesota in 2011 and recently in May 2016.
The human cases of influenza A H1N2v reported in Wisconsin and Minnesota (one case each) had history of contact with pigs prior to illness onset. - Mod.UBA
