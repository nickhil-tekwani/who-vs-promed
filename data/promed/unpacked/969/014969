Sao Paulo confirms new citrus greening disease strain
--------------------------------------------
The Citrus Defense Fund (Fundecitrus) and Institute National de la Reserche
Agronomique (INRA) have confirmed a new strain of citrus greening disease
in Sao Paulo's orchards. The state produces about 90 percent of Brazil's
frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) exports, and, around half of the
world FCOJ market.
Details of a new strain discovered contradicts information, given Thu 5 Jul
2004 by the Sao Paulo state agriculture secretariat, that the strain was
Asian greening. Greening disease is incurable, one of the most serious for
citrus farming, and difficult to control. Where it is endemic, it is
controlled by using healthy shoots, by insecticides, and by the roguing of
affected trees. Pruning of affected branches is not sufficient.
Studies to identify the disease began in March 2004, after citrus farmers
in southern central Sao Paulo reported unfamiliar symptoms in their
orchards to Fundecitrus.
Ademerval Garcia, the president of the Brazilian Citrus Exporters
Association (Abecitrus), warned on Thursday afternoon [5 Jul 2004 ] that
the sector has entered a new era with the discovery of this disease. He
added that there will be a huge increase in production costs, making citrus
farming nonviable in some cases.
Garcia says that Sao Paulo state is contaminated, and the disease is widely
distributed.

[There is no convincing evidence in this report to indicate that the strain
is, in fact, a new one. That will require more research. To my knowledge,
the pathogen that causes citrus greening, now designated citrus
huanglongbin [HLB], is a fastidious prokaryote that remains refractory to
culture on artificial media. There are 2 species of HLB (_Candidatus
Liberibacter asiaticus_ Asian form), the heat-tolerable one, which induces
symptoms in warm climates (27-32 C) and the South African form/strain
(_Candidatus Liberibacter africanus_), which induces severe disease
symptoms on citrus between 22-24 C. Most citrus cultivars, except pumello,
are susceptible to the Asian form. There is no cure for the disease at
present. The HLB agent is spread by propagation, and, by 2 citrus psyllids,
_Diaphorina citri_, which vectors the Asian species, and _Trioza erytreae_,
the primary vector for the African species, but, both can vector either
pathogen.
More than 20 plant diseases are associated with, or known to be caused by,
these bacteria-like organisms, which range in size from 0.25 to 0.5 by 0.8
to 4.0 micrometers. HLB has been reported in Australasia (Papua New Guinea,
East Timor) and in South Africa. A similar disease (cucurbit yellow vine
disease) has been reported to infect cantaloupe, pumpkin, squash and
watermelon in the USA (Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee, Massachusetts). - Mod.DH]
