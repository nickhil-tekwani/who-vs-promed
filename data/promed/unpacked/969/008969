The Chilean Ministry of Health reported today [27 Nov 2008], that the
number of deaths in the capital [Santiago] caused by an outbreak of
listeriosis detected in Brie Lescure cheese has reached 5.

The new report indicates that the 5 deaths occurred in one newborn,
one young boy, 2 adults, and one immunocompromised person (the most
recent victim.)

Health authorities ordered the recall of Brie Lescure cheese after
the bacterium [_Listeria monocytogenes_] was detected in a sample
taken from the refrigerator of a 60-year-old man who contracted the
disease.

According to the official report, to date 91 ill persons have been
registered, of which 42 percent are pregnant women, the group at
greatest risk.

Of the total number of infected patients, 59 percent are residents of
the municipalities of Las Condes & Vitacura, in the eastern section of
Santiago.

Between 20 and 25 cases of listeriosis are [routinely] reported
annually in Chile, but so far in 2008 there have been 91 cases. Ingrid
Heitman, head of the Chilean Public Health Institute reports that
currently between 2 and 3 cases of listeriosis are being reported per
week.

The disease affects mainly immunocompromised patients and pregnant
women and can result in invasion of the nervous system, meningitis,
or pneumonia, and even be fatal in newborns and the elderly.

On Tuesday [25 Nov 2008] Health authorities ordered the withdrawal
from circulation of a certain type of cheese suspected to be the
cause of a listeriosis outbreak that had killed at least 4 persons.

Dr Ingrid Heitman, head of the Chilean Public Health Institute,
reported that they ordered the withdrawal from circulation of Brie
Lescure cheese, in which _Listeria_ bacteria were detected, the
causative agents of listeriosis, a flu-like illness.

However, the exact origin of this outbreak has not been determined
yet. According to Roberto Belmar, regional secretary of the Chilean
Ministry of Health, once the origin is confirmed, a sanitary alert
may be issued. Until now, health authorities in the capital have
recorded 91 cases of the disease, and 60 percent of them originated
in a wealthy area of the capital [Santiago].

Listeriosis is a disease caused by the ingestion of food contaminated
with _Listeria monocytogenes_, and it affects mainly pregnant women.
This condition may be lethal in babies and in the elderly.

[The news releases above report a total of 5 deaths out of 91 reported
cases of listeriosis, 60 percent of whom live in a wealthy section of
the capital, Santiago, but do not give many details as to age, sex, or
co-morbid conditions -- other than 42 percent were pregnant women --
or diet history.

The news releases say that authorities withdrew from circulation a
brand of brie, a soft cheese often implicated as a source of
listeriosis, in which _Listeria monocytogenes_ was detected, but then
go on to say that the exact origin of this outbreak has not as yet
been determined, which implies that this cheese perhaps may not have
been eaten by a significant number of the patients or that a DNA
fingerprint of the strain isolated from patients and the brie did not
substantiate a link.

In addition to newborns, pregnant women, and the elderly, mentioned
above, those with compromised immune defenses (such as, HIV-infected
patients) are also more susceptible to severe forms of listeriosis.

We await a more detailed description of this outbreak, and perhaps
DNA fingerprinting of isolates from the suspected source and from
patients that would confirm a linkage.

A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail
posting no. 20071230.4186.
