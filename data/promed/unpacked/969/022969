[There were reports of bovine anthrax outbreaks in West Kazakhstan in 2005, 2006, 2007, and human cases in 2009, 2011, and 2014. An inheritance from the days of the USSR and its allies is to rely on human cases, not veterinary reporting. So there is a measure of inherent Kazakh underreporting certainly in the past. But they are improving, and notice that their regional diagnosis was based on a PCR test. Though from this report it is unclear whether there is enough Sterne vaccine on hand to protect the rest of the livestock in this village, the speed of their outbreak recognition and diagnostic confirmation, 3 days, is very good. - Mod.MHJ
