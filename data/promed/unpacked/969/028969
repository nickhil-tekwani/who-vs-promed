WHO sounds alert on new diseases

NEW DELHI, April 6.

The South-East Asia Regional Office of WHO has warned of the
possibility of outbreak of several new and deadly infectious
diseases.....
They emphasised the need for extra vigilance, particularly with
regard to plague, since natural foci of the infection existed
besides India, in Indonesia, Myanmar and possibly Nepal also. It
must, they said, be remembered that the total economic loss to
India due to the plague epidemic in 1994 was of the order of
$1.7 billion.
In all, over 45,000 travellers to India had cancelled their
travel plans, leading to 20 to 60 per cent decrease in hotel
occupancy. While Air India lost $66,000 per day, Indian Airlines
lost $1 million every week. There was also a 50 per cent
decrease in ships docking at Mumbai. The country lost $460
million in exports, of which $23 million was in diamond
exports alone, they observed.
[Although diamonds have been responsible for the death of many people during
recorded history, they have never been proved to carry plague - Mod.JW]
The officials particularly emphasised the importance of
developing effective mechanisms to ensure prevention and control
of epidemics, through better disease surveillance systems and by
measures to provide for quick response in case of outbreaks.
