Nicaragua: death toll rises to 32 children
-----------------------------------------
An epidemic caused by rotavirus has killed 32 infants and infected at
least 32 000 children in Nicaragua, health authorities said on Sat 26
Feb 2005. After visiting several hospitals on Saturday, Health
Minister Margarita Gurdian told reporters that about 27 000 children
were infected with the disease earlier this week. The number of
patients suddenly increased by 5000 on Saturday. Most patients were
found in the northern departments of Madriz and Esteli. The Health
Ministry has declared an epidemiological emergency in northern
Nicaragua and asked local medical institutions to take steps to
prevent the disease from spreading.
The disease produces symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and severe dehydration.
About 108 403 cases of diarrhea have been reported this year [2005] in
Central America, with Nicaragua reporting the highest [death?] toll. El
Salvador, in which the highest number of cases -- 73 274 -- were reported,
maintains a state of emergency, declared on 8 Feb 2005, in the most affected
departments of San Salvador, La Libertad and La Paz. At least 20 children
have been killed by the disease in El Salvador.

Russia: rotavirus outbreak in Nyangan (Hunty-Mansiyskiy Autonomous Area)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rotavirus infection is increasing in Nyangan (Hunty-Mansiyskiy
Autonomous Area). According to information from Olga Ezhova, the Head
of the Epidemiology Department in the State Epidemiological
Surveillance Center of Nyangan, 201 persons have been admitted to the
central city hospital with this diagnosis. This is almost twice the
usual number.
High morbidity is apparent at all schools and kindergartens in the
city. According to Olga Ezhova, the peak of the outbreak has passed.
Last week [final week of February 2005], there were 9 to 12 new cases
of rotavirus infection registered each day, whereas now, the daily
number of cases has fallen to 4 to 7 persons. Nevertheless, experts
predict that the outbreak will be prolonged for 2 more weeks.

Russia: [viral?] gastroenteritis in Kazan (Tatarstan)
-----------------------------------------------------
The infectious disease hospitals of Kazan are overflowing with
patients who have been admitted with identical symptoms of high
temperature, vomiting and diarrhea. Medical opinion is that the
townspeople have been exposed to a viral disease. The route of
transmission is unknown. Presumably, the infection can be transmitted
through drinking water or dairy products. It is encouraging that
yesterday [28 Feb 2005], only 11 patients were admitted to hospitals,
a number about 3 times less than during previous days.

USA: nearly 100 passengers sick aboard cruise ship
--------------------------------------------------
Nearly 100 passengers and crew members were sickened with a
gastrointestinal illness on a 5-day Carnival Cruise Line voyage, the
company said on Tue 1 Mar 2005. About 4 percent of passengers and
crew were infected in what officials believe was a norovirus epidemic
on a cruise from Jacksonville to Key West and the Bahamas aboard the
Celebration. The cruise ended Saturday [26 Feb 2005]. In total, 69 of
1647 passengers and 30 of 693 crew members were sick. Final test
results were still pending.
Noroviruses cause acute gastroenteritis in humans and last between 24
and 48 hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea. "Somebody brings
it on board and then it spreads. So, what we do is a very rigorous
cleaning and sanitation effort to remove the virus," said Jennifer de
la Cruz, Carnival Cruise Lines spokeswoman. The Celebration was at
sea on another voyage on Tuesday [1 Mar 2005], and cases of
gastroenteritis were below outbreak levels, de la Cruz said.

Russia: rotavirus outbreak in Ekaterinburg
------------------------------------------
In Ekaterinburg, children's hospitals are working to capacity on
account of an increase in gastroenteritis among children. As many as
15-20 children have been admitted to hospitals daily for several
weeks. According to the City Public Health Department, rotavirus
infection is the most common cause of hospitalization. The majority
of sick children are in the one-to-2 age group. A proportion of
children are in serious condition, because their parents have treated
them at home, and these children exhibited conditions of exicosis and
toxicosis.
According to the Territorial Statistical Department, in the
Sverdlovsk region in the past year [2004], more than 874 000 persons
have been ill with infectious and parasitic illnesses. The largest
gastroenteritis outbreaks have occurred in Irbit, where more than 150
persons, 113 of whom were children, have fallen ill because of the
consumption of poor-quality water. The same situation exists in
Krasnoturyinsk, where the number of patients also was measured in the
hundreds.

Russia: gastroenteritis outbreaks on the increase in Ekaterinburg
-----------------------------------------------------------------
On Fri 4 Mar 2005, 20 more children were admitted to hospitals in
Ekaterinburg with symptoms of gastroenteritis. According to Andrey
Jurovskih, the Head of the Department of Especially Dangerous
Infections, of the Regional Epidemiological Surveillance Center, the
growth of gastroenteritis morbidity is a seasonal effect. As a rule,
it occurs in the winter-spring period. In the current year [2005],
morbidity has exceeded the level observed last year, and is
persisting longer. At the moment, the focus of rotavirus infection is
not obvious.
In Ekaterinburg, the outbreaks of gastrointestinal infection are
still on the increase.
