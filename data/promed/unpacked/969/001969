At least 5 people have died and another 17 others were poisoned in China's southern Yunnan Province after they ate fermented corn flour snacks. Those who fell ill had eaten the cakes at a family gathering on 27 Jun 2014, the Gaungnan county government said in a statement. Many were hospitalized after feeling faint and nauseated, and the victims died days later, the government statement said.

Parts of China, particularly rural areas, sometimes see mass poisonings. Such incidents are usually the result of deliberate acts or food makers that cut corners with dangerous results.

The Yunnan deaths appear to have been the result of people's consuming a snack known as diaojiangba. The authorities have long warned that the food, which is traditionally eaten by the Zhuang ethnic group, poses serious health risks. The cake is made by suspending broth made with corn or other grains in a bag, allowing it to ferment, then squeezing the excess liquid out to form a paste that is made into noodles or cakes.

In the summer months, it can harbor dangerous bacteria, the government of Yunnan's Wenshan Prefecture announced in a 2011 notice. A 2006 medical study documented the deaths of 4 people who ate the substance in Guizhou Province. The fermented corn produces a bacterium that can be particularly harmful to people and has also been associated with tempeh made from coconut in Indonesia.

[The cause of this cluster of foodborne illness is formally now referred to as _Burkholderia gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_, as discussed in the following article with its abstract:

Jiao Z, Kawamura Y, Mishima N, et al: Need to differentiate lethal toxin-producing strains of _Burkholderia gladioli_, which cause severe food poisoning: description of _B. gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_ and an emended description of _B. gladioli_. Microbiol Immunol. 2003;47: 915-25.

"Abstract:
_Burkholderia cocovenenans_ produces a lethal toxin (Bongkrekic acid) that leads to high fatality in food poisoning cases. However, _B. cocovenenans_ was combined in _Burkholderia gladioli_ in 1999. _B. gladioli_ was originally described as a phytopathogenic bacteria that sometimes causes pneumonia in humans and that acts as an opportunistic pathogen. We thought that it was clinically dangerous to describe these 2 species without considering their pathogenicities. From our data of 16S rRNA sequence analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization, and fatty acid analysis, we could confirm that _B. cocovenenans_ and _B. gladioli_ should be categorized as a single species. However the species really weaved lethal toxin-producing strains with non-lethal strains. To emphasize that _B. gladioli_ contains 2 different pathogens, we describe a new pathovar, _B. gladioli_ pathovar _cocovenenans_, for the lethal toxin-producing strains. We provide characteristics that differentiate this lethal toxin-producing pathovar from other phytopathogenic pathovars within _B. gladioli_, together with an emended description of _B. gladioli_."

An earlier discussion of the toxin can be found below:

Hu WJ, Chen XM, Meng HD, Meng ZH: Fermented corn flour poisoning in rural areas of China. III. Isolation and identification of main toxin produced by causal microorganisms. Biomed Environ Sci. 1989 Mar;2: 65-71.

"Abstract:
Flavotoxin A was isolated from _Pseudomonas cocovenenans_ subsp. culture in semisolid potato-dextrose-agar medium, which was isolated from fermented corn meal that had caused food poisoning outbreaks in China. The isolation, purification, and chemical structure of this toxin were studied. The NMR spectra, the uv spectra, and molar extinction coefficients, and the mass spectra of Flavotoxin A are in good agreement with those reported for bongkrekic acid. Therefore, Flavotoxin A and bongkrekic acid are the same organic chemical compound; the molecular formula is C28H38O7. The oral LD50 of the purified Flavotoxin A in mice was 3.16 mg/kg (1.53-6.15 mg/kg). The existence of bongkrekic acid in toxic fermented corn samples collected during food poisoning outbreaks was also confirmed. It is concluded that bongkrekic acid has played an important role in the outbreaks of fermented corn poisoning."

Fermented foods are used throughout the world and provide numerous benefits particularly to people in developing countries. The foods play an important role in providing food security, enhancing livelihoods and improving the nutrition and social wellbeing of much of the world's population, especially those who are marginalized and vulnerable.
