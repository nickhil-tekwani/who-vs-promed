Stomatitis in equines in the State of Colorado
----------------------------------------------
On Jul 2, 2004, an equine premises in Colorado met the index case
definition for vesicular stomatitis (VS). Later that day, a second equine
premises then met the subsequent case definition for VS. The infected
premises have been placed under quarantine.
VS is a viral disease which primarily affects horses, cattle, and swine.
The virus that causes VS has a wide host range. VS also occasionally
affects sheep and goats. In affected livestock, the VS virus causes
blisterlike lesions to form in the mouth and on the dental pad, tongue,
lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell and break, leaving
raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals generally refuse to eat
and drink and show signs of lameness. Severe weight loss usually follows,
and in dairy cows, a severe drop in milk production commonly occurs.
Affected dairy cattle can appear to be normal and will continue to eat
about half of their feed intake.
For additional information on VS please refer to the following APHIS
webpage: <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/issues/vs/vs.html>. If you have any
questions about this situation, please call the Emergency Management Staff
at 301-734-8073.
