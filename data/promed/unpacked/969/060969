The Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory has reported that it has confirmed 6 new cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in that state.

Three additional cases were diagnosed in Texas earlier this year [2016]. The positive cases are located in the following counties:
Limestone County
Erath County
Denton County
Austin County
Montgomery County
Lamar County
Polk County
McLennan County
Wood County

West Nile is also transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

The clinical signs WNV can be consistent with other important neurologic diseases such as rabies and EHV-1; therefore, it is important to work with your veterinarian to get an accurate diagnosis through laboratory testing.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners also need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[This is actually a very wide spread of this disease. It is a huge warning to vaccinate your horses. The vaccine is usually combined with EEE (eastern equine encephalitis), which has also been diagnosed recently in Texas. Take heed Texas horse owners!! - Mod.TG

Nevada Department of Agriculture is reporting West Nile Virus infections in 2 horses; one in Churchill County and one in Clark County. While horses are not a source of human infection, a horse with WNV is an indication that other horses and people are at risk.

NDA's state veterinarian, Dr JJ Goicoechea, says it's important for horse owners to vaccinate their animals against West Nile Virus.

The Animal Disease Lab identified West Nile positive mosquito pools in Clark, Churchill, Elko, Douglas, Lincoln and Washoe Counties. Mosquitos also tested positive for Saint Louis Encephalitis in Clark and White Pine Counties.

Mosquito season is expected to end with the 1st frost in October. Till then all Nevada residents should take precautions such as eliminating mosquito-breeding sites, using insect repellents to fight the bite and keeping horses vaccinated against WNV and Western Equine Encephalitis.

[The best means of protecting horses is to vaccinate them against WNV. A WNV vaccine is usually combined with EEE (eastern equine encephalitis) and WEE (western equine encephalitis). If your horse has never been vaccinated then 2 injections are required, about 3-4 weeks apart.

Rid the area of any standing water (old tires, flower pot catch pans, etc) where mosquitoes can breed. Use mosquito repellent spray that is recommended by your veterinarian. - Mod.TG
