Two cases of laboratory-confirmed Barmah Forest virus disease have been found in Tasmania this year [2019].

The Public Health Service is advising people living in and travelling to the East Coast to protect themselves against mosquitoes. There are 3 cases still under investigation; however, all cases live on, or have travelled to, the state's east.

The infection is caused by a virus and is spread by mosquitoes, Public Health's clinical director doctor Faline Howes said. "This is unusual. These may be the 1st diagnosed cases of this virus caught in Tasmania. Over the last 5 years, 2 cases of Barmah Forest virus disease have been notified; both were probably caught interstate," she said.

Many people will not get symptoms, but those who do might experience joint pain and swelling, tiredness, rashes, headaches, muscle pain, fever, and chills. Symptoms usually start 7-10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.

Most people recover completely in a few weeks. [The infection] is diagnosed with a blood test. There is no specific treatment available, so prevention is important.

If you think you may have symptoms of Barmah Forest virus, see your GP. For further information call the Public Health Hotline on 1800 671 738.

Tips to protect against mosquitoes:
- Avoid mosquito-infested areas, where possible.
- Cover up with a loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirt and long pants when outside.
- Put mosquito repellent on exposed skin.
- Take special care during peak mosquito biting hours, especially around dawn and dusk, and when outdoors or camping.
- Remove potential mosquito breeding sites from around the home, and screen windows and doors.

[This is the 1st report of Barmah forest virus (BFV) infections in Tasmania state. It has occurred sporadically in Queensland state over recent years. An extensive summary of Barmah Forest virus epidemiology in Australia and the disease it produces, which can be found in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130417.1653395, states that "Barmah Forest disease virus was 1st isolated from mosquitoes (_Culex annulirostris_) in the Barmah Forest, Northern Victoria, in 1974. Human infection was subsequently reported along the south coast of New South Wales during the mid-1980s; in Queensland during 1988-1989; in the Northern Territory in 1992; and in southwestern Western Australia in 1993. A new focus was described in Gippsland (Victoria) during 1993-1994. The number of localities reporting Barmah Forest disease increased during 1996-1998, and again during 1999-2001. The known vectors are _Ochlerotatus vigilax_, _Culex annulirostris_, _Aedes (Oc.) camptorhynchus_, _Ae. normanensis_, and _Coquillettidia spp._. _Aedes notoscriptus_ is considered an additional potential vector. BFD virus has also been recovered from _Aedes vigilax_ in eastern Australia (2005-2008) [but isolation of virus does not prove vector competence]."

BFV is endemic in the country, and future outbreaks can be expected when there are periods of higher-than-usual rainfall that often bring an increase in mosquito populations, with corresponding increases in transmission of endemic arthropod-borne viruses, including BFV, in those areas. An earlier post noted that, as of 2017, Ross River disease and Barmah Forest disease continue to infect a considerable number of people in Queensland, Australia. In fact, local rates of these 2 mosquito-borne viral infections have changed little during the past 25 years. [1] (See graph at https://www.gideononline.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/AustArbo.png).

No vaccines are commercially available for either of these viruses. The only preventive measures available are vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites. - Mod.TY
