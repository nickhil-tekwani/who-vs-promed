The National Reference Laboratory FLI has confirmed 3 additional ASF [African swine fever]-infected wild boars in the core zones. The one found in MOL [Markisch-Oderland] was heavily decomposed; this cadaver is estimated to have been lying there 4 weeks before being discovered. Total number of ASF cases in Germany is now 53.

[Since the 1st discovery of ASF-infected wild boars in Brandenburg (10 Sep 2020), close to the Polish border, 2 core zones have been declared. The 1st core zone, declared 10 Sep 2020, includes areas in 2 adjacent districts (landkreis), Oder-Spree and Spree-Neise, in which 42 and 9 cases, respectively, have been confirmed as of 8 Oct 2020. The 2nd core zone, declared 30 Sep 2020 (ProMED-mail post 20200930.7825694), is situated in the district of Markisch-Oderland, in which 2 cases have been confirmed as of 8 Oct 2020, including the one reported in the above report. As it appears now, this district had its 1st infected boar several weeks before the 1st discovery of an infected animal.

For a map presenting the 2 core zones and the boundaries of their common "infected zone" (which has been merged, covering also the in-between district Frankfurt (Oder)), please see https://msgiv.brandenburg.de/msgiv/de/themen/verbraucherschutz/veterinaerwesen/tierseuchen/afrikanische-schweinepest/.

No ASF case in a domestic pig has been reported from Germany. - Mod.AS
