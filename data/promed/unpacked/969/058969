New virus found in Norwegian trout hatcheries
---------------------------------------------
The Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI) has identified a new disease in hatcheries for rainbow trout. Preliminary information suggests that the disease is caused by a virus and that it is contagious.

The mortality rate had partly increased in the hatcheries, which led producers to contact the Norwegian Food Safety Authorities (NFSA). They brought in the NVI and both are now working closely with the Norwegian fish health services and industry players to identify the cause and determine how the disease is transferred.

The 1st incidents were in Hoagland [Hordaland county?] and Sogn og Fjordane [county]. Typical symptoms include circulation failure and anemia, and the fish may also often have a heart infection.

Brit Hjelnes, senior fish and shellfish health adviser at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute (NVI), says the history of the suspected virus in Norwegian trout goes back to August 2013, when the 1st incident was uncovered.
