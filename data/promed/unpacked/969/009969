ELEPHANT BLINDNESS - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

I am a veterinarian working at the Jerusalem zoo. I would appreciate some
assistance with an eye problem in elephants, and would be grateful if I can
get any new ideas.
The problem began with two females that arrived from Thailand last year
(Sep *97) They are approximately 11-13 years old. Two months after their
arrival they developed a severe keratitis.
This was characterized by severe bilateral blepharospasm [closing of the
eye lids], photophobia [sensitivity to light], huge amount of sero-mucoid
discharge and a diffuse corneal edema that was progressive until it
obscured the view of the iris and the elephants were completely blind. It
took about 3-4 days to reach its peak. The conjuctivas did not look
inflamed and the fluorescein seemed to be negative all the way through.
Then within 3-5 weeks the opacity and discharges slowly decreased until the
eye was clear.
Since then very similar episodes reoccurred at about every 3-4 months
intervals (Feb 98, Jul 98, Oct 98, Feb 99 and last July), and in 2 episodes
we were seeing the symptoms in 4 of our herd (5 elephants). The elephants
now show signs of accumulated damage to the eyes: Cloudy cornea with
pigmentation and scarring. There wasnÂ¢t any connection with the different
seasons of the year.
All exams have come back negative or unremarkable, including bacteriology
swabs (only _Staphylococcus_ sp. plasma coagulase (-) was isolated),
_Chlamydia_ sp., _Mycoplasma_ sp., viral isolation, serology for
_Leptospira_ and for herpes: BHV-1, BHV-2, PCR for HSV-1,2 and a special
elephant herpes. In cytology scrape they did not find any signs for local
infection. No differences were observed between the different treatments
given. We did not find any environmental changes in history research that
we have done before each episode e.g. splashes from chemicals related to
cage cleaning.
We did an intensive blood work, looking for systemic infection and found
that during the whole period, the affected animals had hematological signs
of anemia and lately signs of luekocytosis without any signs of toxicity.
Blood was taken to check for blood parasites with no positive results. The
elephants are treated routinely with ivomec* P.O.[per os, orally] 4 times a
year. We did an urinalysis tests and in one of the elephants, we found
large numbers of crystals in the urine, high levels of protein and both
_Streptococcus_ sp.. and _Corynebacterium_ sp.. were found in the bacterial
culture. (Later all the elephants were found to be positive for these
bacteria.) Other symptoms: Chronic diarrhea in one of the elephant was
observed and _Salmonella typhimurium_ was isolated (again later all the
elephants were found to be positive).
We did seek the help of a veterinary ophthalmologists - Dr. Ron Ofri from
the Koret Veterinary School of the Hebrew University, and he helped with
the diagnose that the lens and uvea are clean and it seemed to attack the
cornea itself.
It looks like some latent systemic or local infection that every few months
break out, always in the two elephants simultaneously and with the same
clinical signs.
