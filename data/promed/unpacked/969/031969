*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Sab [Caribbean Netherlands].

- As worldwide cases climb above 1 million and deaths over 50 000, Dr Tedros stressed that the best way for countries to end restrictions and ease their economic effects was to attack the virus with an aggressive and comprehensive package of measures.

- WHO has released new technical guidance recommending universal access to public hand hygiene stations and making their use obligatory on entering and leaving any public or private commercial building and any public transport facility. It also recommends that healthcare facilities improve access to and practice of hand hygiene. More information is available at https://www.who.int/publications-detail/recommendations-to-member-states-to-improve-hand-hygiene-practices-by-providing-universal-access-to-public-hand-hygiene-stations-to-help-prevent-the-transmission-of-the-covid-19-virus.

- WHO/Europe has received a Euro 30 million [about USD 32.4 million] contribution from the European Commission for 6 WHO European Region member states -- Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, the Republic of Moldova, and Ukraine -- to meet immediate needs in their responses to COVID-19. Additional information is available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/countries/azerbaijan/news/news/2020/4/whoeurope-works-with-european-commission-to-fight-covid-19-in-countries-across-eastern-europe-and-the-caucasus.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [10:00 AM 4 Apr 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.UBA

Grand total (including China and Diamond Princess): 1 051 635 (79 332) / 56 985 (6664)

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

Strategic objectives
--------------------
WHO's strategic objectives for this response are to:
- interrupt human-to-human transmission including reducing secondary infections among close contacts and health care workers, preventing transmission amplification events, and preventing further international spread*;
- identify, isolate and care for patients early, including providing optimized care for infected patients;
- identify and reduce transmission from the animal source;
- address crucial unknowns regarding clinical severity, extent of transmission and infection, treatment options, and accelerate the development of diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines;
- communicate critical risk and event information to all communities and counter misinformation;
- minimize social and economic impact through multisectoral partnerships.
*This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travelers, awareness-raising in the population, and risk communication.

Preparedness and response
-------------------------
- To view all technical guidance documents regarding COVID-19, please go to https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance.
- WHO has developed interim guidance for laboratory diagnosis, advice on the use of masks during home care and in health care settings in the context of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, clinical management, infection prevention and control in health care settings, home care for patients with suspected novel coronavirus, risk communication and community engagement, and Global Surveillance for human infection with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
- WHO is working closely with International Air Transport Association (IATA) and have jointly developed a guidance document to provide advice to cabin crew and airport workers, based on country queries. The guidance can be found on the IATA webpage at https://www.iata.org/en/programs/safety/health/diseases/%23tab-2.
- WHO has been in regular and direct contact with member states where cases have been reported. WHO is also informing other countries about the situation and providing support as requested.
- WHO is working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on surveillance, epidemiology, mathematical modelling, diagnostics and virology, clinical care and treatment, infection prevention and control, and risk communication. WHO has issued interim guidance for countries, which are updated regularly.
- WHO has prepared a disease commodity package [https://www.who.int/publications-detail/disease-commodity-package---novel-coronavirus-(ncov)] that includes an essential list of biomedical equipment, medicines and supplies necessary to care for patients with 2019-nCoV.
- WHO has provided recommendations to reduce risk of transmission from animals to humans [https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus/who-recommendations-to-reduce-risk-of-transmission-of-emerging-pathogens-from-animals-to-humans-in-live-animal-markets].
- WHO has published an updated advice for international traffic in relation to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV [https://www.who.int/ith/2019-nCoV_advice_for_international_traffic-rev/en/].
- WHO has activated the R&D blueprint to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics.
- Open WHO is an interactive, web-based, knowledge-transfer platform offering online courses to improve the response to health emergencies. COVID-19 courses can be found at https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19 and courses in additional national languages at https://openwho.org/channels/covid-19-national-languages. Specifically, WHO has developed online courses on the following topics:
-- A general introduction to emerging respiratory viruses, including novel coronaviruses (available in Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Hindi, Indian Sign Language, Persian, Portuguese, Serbian, and Turkish);
-- Clinical care for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (available in English, French, Russian, Indonesian and Vietnamese);
-- Health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases -ePROTECT (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, and Portuguese);
-- Infection Prevention and Control for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (available in Chinese, English, French, Russian, Spanish, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Serbian); and
-- COVID-19 Operational Planning Guidelines and COVID-19 Partners Platform to support country preparedness and response (available in English and coming soon in additional languages).
- WHO is providing guidance on early investigations, which are critical in an outbreak of a new virus. The data collected from the protocols can be used to refine recommendations for surveillance and case definitions, to characterize the key epidemiological transmission features of COVID-19,help understand spread, severity, spectrum of disease, impact on the community and to inform operational models for implementation of countermeasures such as case isolation, contact tracing, and isolation. Several protocols are available at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/early-investigations. One such protocol is for the investigation of early COVID-19 cases and contacts (the "First Few X (FFX) Cases and contact investigation protocol for 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection"; https://www.who.int/publications-detail/the-first-few-x-(ffx)-cases-and-contact-investigation-protocol-for-2019-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)-infection). The protocol is designed to gain an early understanding of the key clinical, epidemiological and virological characteristics of the first cases of COVID-19 infection detected in any individual country, to inform the development and updating of public health guidance to manage cases and reduce the potential spread and impact of infection.

Recommendations and advice for the public
-----------------------------------------
If you are not in an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not travelled from an area where COVID-19 is spreading, or have not been in contact with an infected patient, your risk of infection is low. It is understandable that you may feel anxious about the outbreak. Get the facts from reliable sources to help you accurately determine your risks so that you can take reasonable precautions [further details and information are available at the source URL above.

[According to the report above, a total of 81 669 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 3329 deaths, representing an increase of 30 cases and 3 deaths in the 24 hours since the last report was prepared. Out of the 30 new cases, 25 were imported while 5 occurred as a result of local transmission. In addition, 3 deaths were reported, all from Hubei. 17 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, and Macau reported 1 newly confirmed case in the past 24 hours.

A total of 25 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Origins of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now increasing, which presents a challenge for the Chinese public health authorities to identify the infections in imported cases, contact tracing, and prevent emergence of new clusters of community transmission.
