A suspected infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) outbreak has been reported on a Gray Aqua farm in Hermitage Bay, Newfoundland, Canada, writes Lucy Towers, TheFishSite Editor.

The Newfoundland Aquaculture Industry Association told TheFishSite that the suspected ISA outbreak has not yet been confirmed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

While the investigation continues the farm has been put under quarantine to prevent any possible spread of infection. If the ISA outbreak is confirmed, the fish will be harvested and disposed of in an approved manner.

The farm currently holds young fish under one year of age which have no market value.

[This highly contagious disease can be insidious with an initially low mortality rate; however, the cumulative mortality can sometimes exceed 90 per cent if the disease remains unchecked.

Infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV) is a member of the genus _Isavirus_ in the family _Orthomyxoviridae_. Hemorrhagic kidney syndrome is an old name for the disease in Atlantic salmon. In coho salmon, it has also been called icterus syndrome.

ISA is a disease of Atlantic salmon (_Salmo salar_) caused by an orthomyxovirus and affects mainly fish maintained in marine water or exposed to the sea. The disease is systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry.

The differential diagnoses for infectious salmon anemia include other causes of anemia and hemorrhages as well as winter ulcer and septicemias caused by _Moritella viscosa_.

Outbreaks of infectious salmon anemia can be diagnosed by virus isolation, the detection of antigens, and RT-PCR [reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]. A few isolates from sick salmon have been difficult to culture, even when viral nucleic acids can be found. The avirulent isolates carried subclinically in wild salmonids can usually be detected only by RT-PCR.

Infectious salmon anemia is an OIE-listed disease as well as a regulated aquatic animal disease in Canada under the Health of Animals Act and supporting regulations that are administered by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
