Global Initiative on Late Blight Linkage Group on Variation and Evolution of
_Phytophthora infestans_
At the Global Initiative on Late Blight (GILB) International Conference,
"Late Blight: A Threat to Global Food Security," held 16-19 Mar 1999, in
Quito, Ecuador, several thematic linkage groups were proposed, including
one covering all aspects of research on how populations of _Phytophthora
infestans_ are evolving around the world.
The main intention of the group is to provide mutual support and
encouragement for all researchers and, to be successful, the group needs a
good cross-section of workers-from the most technically advanced to the
less well-equipped and under-financed laboratories, worldwide.
Information on GILB can be found at <http://www.cipotato.org/gilb>
