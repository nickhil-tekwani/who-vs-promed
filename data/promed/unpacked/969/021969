UNDIAGNOSED DIE-OFF, WILD BIRDS - ZAMBIA (LIVINGSTON)(03)

I was in Livingstone for several days last week and I did not see any
dead birds.
I was at Mfuwe Lodge South Luongwa National Park the weekend before
and did not see any dead birds there either. I did see lot of
tourists. The lodge was filled to capacity. South Luongwa has one of
the highest concentrations of wildlife of any of the southern African
parks. I was at Madikwe in South Africa 2 years ago and saw far fewer animals.
I did not get the impression that tourism was dead in Zimbabwe. I met
many people in the Victoria Falls area and Livingstone who had come
over via Zimbabwe. In fact it seemed to be the more popular route to
access the Falls than through Lusaka.
