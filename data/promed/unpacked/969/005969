MALARIA - OMAN (02): COMMENT

Let me clarify that the Muscat Daily article about the malaria situation in Oman published on 8 Apr 2014 and quoting me is not true.

I was never interviewed, and the facts about the malaria situation in Oman were negatively distorted. Unfortunately, an edited version of the article was published in ProMED on 12 Apr 2014. I hope that this error will be clarified in ProMED by publishing that what is mentioned in the Muscat Daily article is incorrect.

The majority of the cases in Oman are internationally imported, e.g. 98.9 percent in 2012, and only 1.07 percent were due to secondary local transmission. 95.7 percent were due to _Plasmodium vivax_, while _P. falciparum_ caused only 4.3 percent of the cases. The secondary malaria cases that occurred in Oman are due to both symptomatic and asymptomatic immigrants, mainly from the Indian-subcontinent, carrying gametocytes of the malaria parasites, mainly _P. vivax_.

For further details about the malaria situation in Oman, please refer to pages 8-69 to 8-74 of the annual health report published by the Ministry of Health in Oman, found at http://www.moh.gov.om/en/stat/2012/Chapters/CH08Y12.pdf.

[ProMED thanks Dr Al-Zadjali for this correction.

Oman interrupted malaria transmission in 2004 and maintained it until September 2007, when a focus of local transmission (with 4 cases) was detected in Dakhiliya governorate. Due to the highly receptive environment of the country and the increased vulnerability as a result of the increased numbers of imported cases among the immigrants from malaria endemic countries, secondary cases occurred in North Sharqiya governorate in 2010, North Sharqiya and Dakhiliya in 2011, and North and South Sharqiya and North Batinah in 2012. The number of imported cases started to show a decrease from 2029 in 2012 to 1440 cases in 2013. Of the total 1451 cases recorded in 2013, the majority (99.24 percent) were internationally imported except for 11 secondary cases (http://www.moh.gov.om/en/stat/2012/Chapters/CH08Y12.pdf).
