Dog owners are being warned of a tickborne disease which is likely to spread around the UK. Government health agencies are investigating how the condition canine babesiosis came to be found in 4 dogs that have never travelled outside of England. [See letter to the Veterinary Record in the commentary. - Mod.AS]

Unique to dogs, the rare single-celled [protozoan] parasite infects the animals with the disease [by ticks] in a similar way to how malaria is transferred to humans by mosquitoes. Babesiosis attacks the blood cells of dogs causing lethargy, weakness, pale gums, red/brown urine and fever, among other clinical features.

Four dogs have contracted canine babesiosis in Harlow, Essex, in recent months despite not travelling abroad, with 2 of the animals dying. The outbreak, described by vets as of "huge significance", is caused by infected ticks and can also leave dogs suffering with a lack of appetite, anaemia, enlarged abdomen, weight loss, and jaundice.

Canine babesiosis is known to exist in mainland Europe, but this is the 1st time dogs have contracted the disease in the United Kingdom [but see a 2006 report in the commentary]. They had all walked along the same uncultivated patch of land. The Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) and Public Health England (PHE) are examining ticks found in the field after a search on 11 Mar 2016. Scientists around the country involved in Britain's largest-ever study of tickborne illness in dogs warn that vigilance is needed against threat from new diseases.

If left untreated it [canine babesiosis] can be fatal and vets have needed to perform emergency blood transfusions to stop the disease. Dogs that have been prescribed with anti-tick treatment by vets have not been affected. The disease-carrying tick has previously been found only in Devon and Wales, but in those cases it was not carrying babesia.

Professor Richard Wall, from the University of Bristol, said: "The recent babesia cases in Essex are of huge significance. "The fact that we now appear to have established populations of the tick _Dermacentor reticulatus_ acting as vectors of the introduced pathogen _Babesia canis_ is a new and important development and a major concern for animal health."

Debbie White, practice manager at Forest Veterinary Centre in Essex, has treated dogs infected by babesia in recent months. She said: "The cases of _B. canis_ that we have seen in the last few months have highlighted that after a warm, wet winter, ticks are not only active earlier than ever, they are carrying potentially new and harmful disease and we will be encouraging our pet owners to take steps to protect their pets effectively from tick bites."

There are a number of prescription treatments to reduce the risk associated with ticks in dogs. These include sprays, collars, and chewable formulations which give up to 12 weeks protection.

Concerns about the tick were first raised by Clive Swainsbury, practice partner at Forest Veterinary Centre, who have a surgery in Harlow. Mr Swainsbury said he has seen an increase of dog owners worried about babesiosis entering the surgery.

[The newspaper report above, similarly to several others published last week (week of 7 Mar 2016) by Britain's media, is based on the following letter, which appeared in the Veterinary Record vol 178, p 172) of 13 Feb 2016, written by Clive Swainsbury, Glenn Bengtson, and Paul Hill, Forest Veterinary Centre, Harlow, Essex (see http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/178/7/172.1.full.pdf+html?sid=c5792247-98dc-4593-8a86-873542b5c644):

"Babesiosis in dogs
-------------------
"We read with interest the news that the RSPCA [Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] was shocked at the number of dogs being imported from countries in Eastern Europe among others (VR, January 30, 2016, vol 178, p 106).

"We would like to report what we believe is the 1st outbreak of babesiosis in Harlow, Essex. 3 dogs from separate households have, within the past 3 months, contracted babesiosis without travelling abroad. A common link between the 3 is that they are all regularly exercised in an uncultivated park area of land within the town. We have recovered what we believe to be _Dermacentor_ species ticks from 2 dogs.

"There has been a marked increase in the number of dogs being rescued from abroad into the area but we are at a loss to know why the requirement to treat dogs for ticks upon entry to the UK was relaxed. We suggest all clinicians should bear in mind the possibility of babesiosis in anaemic dogs without them necessarily having travelled."

Subscribers are referred to a 2006 paper in the Veterinary Record, describing fatal babesiosis in an untraveled, 10 year old entire male Welsh springer spaniel dog in Kent (ref 1), which included the following excerpts (references omitted):

"The dog had been bred in Poole, Dorset, and moved to Ashford, Kent [England], at 2 years of age. It had boarded several times in a non-quarantine kennel in Ashford, the last visit being 7 weeks before presentation. The only in-contact animal was a healthy English springer spaniel. Neither dog had travelled outside the UK or received a blood transfusion.

"To the authors' knowledge, this is the 1st case of babesiosis reported in an untravelled British dog. The morphological characteristics of the piroplasm identified it as _Babesia_ species, and PCR analysis confirmed it to be _B. canis_. However, the molecular sequences were more closely related to _B. canis vogeli_ than to _B. canis canis_. _B. canis vogeli_ is well adapted to dogs resident in enzootic areas of Europe, and infection results in mild disease unless the animal is young or has intercurrent infections. However, the clinical findings in the present case were compatible with acute fulminant babesiosis in an immunologically naive dog.

"The 94 per cent genetic similarity of the isolate with _B. canis vogeli_ warrants further molecular characterisation to clarify the relationship with other _B. canis_ subspecies. There is a possibility that this is an unusual autochthonous infection.

"Irrespective of the _Babesia_ subspecies involved, it is suggested that babesiosis should now be considered a differential diagnosis for haemolytic anaemia in dogs, irrespective of whether the dog has travelled outside the UK. It is also imperative that owners and veterinary surgeons recognise the importance of routine acaricidal therapy for all dogs, particularly where there are significant numbers travelling into the UK under PETS [Pet Travel Scheme]."

Detailed laboratory test results, including molecular characterisation of the babesia species engaged in the 4 recent canine cases in Essex, would be helpful.
