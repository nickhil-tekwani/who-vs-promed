Health authorities in the state of Victoria [Australia] have been contacted
by more than 1300 people concerned they may have been infected with
hepatitis C [virus] by the suspended anaesthetist, Dr James Latham.

A total of 12 women who had undergone abortion procedures at the Croydon
Day Surgery abortion clinic in Melbourne have contracted the disease from
anaesthetist Dr James Latham, whose registration has since been suspended.
Dr Latham may face criminal charges following the investigations made by
police on matters that occurred between June 2008 and December 2009.

Daniel Andrews, Victoria's health minister says the chief health officer
and the deputy health officer are responding to more than 1300 phone calls
made to the information line. Mr Andrews told reporters: "Just about all
those people have had a phone call back. My officials are working very hard
to contact those people and dealing with their risks." Many tests were
being performed to check whether other patients had contracted the disease,
he said. "We are proactively contacting patients who may be at increased
risk because they were treated by this particular doctor during this
particular time period. We have contacted those patients we knew were
hepatitis C positive and referred it to Victoria Police; that's been done.
The 2nd issue is to respond properly to the more than 1300 patients who
have rung the help line, and the 3rd issue is to look back and contact all
patients (at the clinic)."

[So far, no further cases of hepatitis C virus infection in addition to the
12 patients identified previously have been detected among some 1300
patients who attended the Croydon Day Surgery abortion clinic in Melbourne
and may have been treated by an anaesthetist now identified as a hepatitis
C virus carrier. Testing is still in progress, and further information is
awaited regarding the outcome of these tests together with information on
the route of transmission of the infection.

People exposed to hepatitis C virus infection rarely exhibit symptoms in
the short term, but the virus persists in the liver in about 85 per cent of
cases, and ultimately some may develop serious disease (cirrhosis and cancer).
