The oldest animal rights group in Norway has warned pet owners across the country that their cats face a high risk of contracting so-called feline AIDS, after their lab tests on stray animals in one region showed a skyrocketing rate of infection on the streets.

A new study carried out by the Dyrebeskyttelsen Norge (Animal Protection Norway) charity has revealed that between 70 and 80 percent of stray cats tested across the Hadeland region tested positive for the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

As stray cats tend to migrate across regions, the group warned that more animals could soon get infected across the country. House cats are also at risk of contracting the virus after interacting with wild animals on the street.

"More cats [were] infected than we had expected. We recently received a cat from Jevnaker that had developed cat AIDS, which is the stage after FIV," Kristin Bjerkas from the charity told the local Hadeland.no newspaper.

Since last year [2014], Dyrebeskyttelsen, by systematically testing male cats on the streets in that region, has diagnosed 9 cats with "AIDS" which they had developed from FIV.

FIV is similar to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in that, 1st of all, it attacks the animal's immune system. Throughout the world between 2.5 and 4.4 percent of cats carry the virus.

The virus has 3 phases of development. The initial or acute stage, which manifests itself 4 to 6 weeks after exposure, causes high fever and opens susceptibility to skin or intestinal infections.

The 2nd or the latent stage which follows shows no signs of disease and can last for many years as the immune system of the animal is being destroyed.

The final stage is the AIDS-like phase commonly found in cats 5 to 12 years of age. At this level the cat's immune system is not functioning correctly and the cat gets prone to bacterial, fungal, or parasitic infections. At this phase the decease is incurable. But the good news is that it cannot spread to humans.

To avoid the outbreak of the decease, the charity urges their owners to sterilize their animals in order to quell their natural instinct to fight or sexually engage with other cats.

"I understand that this may cause panic among cat owners, but it is important that people take it seriously. We cannot say it enough: castrate your animals," Bjerkas said, Norway's branch of The Local reported.

At the same time, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (NFSA) says it is not so concerned about a potential outbreak for home pets.

"There are many diseases among animals, and NFSA analyses whether or not they are increasing through reports from animal hospitals and veterinarians. Regarding FIV, the number of cases has been stable for many years," Ole-Herman Tronerud, veterinarian with NFSA, told Dagbladet.

[The Norwegian findings reflect similar situations in countries where dense stray cat populations are present. The suffering to which stray cats are exposed deserves to be taken into consideration by those responsible for the control of their populations and/or for the enhancement of cat welfare/health.

FIV was 1st isolated and described in 1986 from domestic cats with immunodeficiency-like syndromes in a northern California [USA] cattery. The 5 major subtypes (clades) of FIV are designated A through E, and each has a particular geographic distribution throughout the world. FIV is similar to HIV in genome structure and immunopathogenesis, and has been utilized as the only naturally occurring animal model of immunodeficiency for HIV infection in people.

Acute FIV infection results in flu-like symptoms including peripheral lymphadenopathy, neutropenia, and pyrexia. During terminal stages of infection, animals exhibit feline acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (FAIDS), which includes opportunistic infections, lymphomas, wasting, and death. As in HIV infection, there is typically a protracted asymptomatic phase lasting at least several years prior to the terminal immunodeficiency syndrome. Despite a lack of clinical signs, there is evidence of immunological impairment (CD4+ T cell depletion and CD4/CD8 ratio inversion) during the asymptomatic phase.
