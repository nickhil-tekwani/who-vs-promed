A University of Miami researcher identified papillomavirus, confirmed
through DNA molecular testing on tissue from two manatees inhabiting
separate areas of Florida's Gulf coast. It was the first time any virus
had been found in manatees, which have strong immune systems, UM scientist
Dr Gregory Bossart said.

Papillomavirus causes lesions in a variety of mammals including humans.
The tumours rarely are malignant, but can appear above the eyes, on the
mouth or genitals, causing functional problems for the creatures,
researchers said.

More than 400 manatees died last year, the worst mortality record of any
year on record. About 150 of those were killed by brevetoxin, a substance
produced by red tide, a massive algae bloom.
