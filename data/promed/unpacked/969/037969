Indonesia confirmed on Thursday [7 Sep 2006] another person had died
of bird flu as the nation hardest-hit by H5N1 continues to battle a
disease that experts fear could one day spark a global pandemic.
Indonesia's 47th fatality from the virus was a woman from South
Sulawesi province, said Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari, adding
that infected birds had been found dead in the same area. "This we
knows from the results of the (tests by the) Health Ministry's
Research and Development Board last night (Wednesday)," Supari was
quoted by AFP as telling journalists.
"We did not send (the samples) to the WHO (World Health Organisation)
because our positive results are usually positive results at the
WHO," she added. Up until now, Indonesia has always sent blood and
tissue samples from suspected human bird flu cases to a WHO
laboratory in Hong Kong for confirmation. Sari Setiogi, the WHO
spokesperson in Indonesia, said that under a new arrangement Jakarta
could confirm infections after 2 local tests showed the person to
have contracted H5N1.
Supari gave no further details other than that the latest bird flu
case had first been discovered on 24 Jun 2006. Indonesia, the world's
4th most populous nation, is grappling with ongoing outbreaks of
H5N1, which has infected 61 people to date, 47 of them with fatal
consequences.
The minister said that they would soon carry out poultry culling in
the area where the case was found. "We will soon do 'stamping out',
because they found dead birds in the area," Supari said.

Indonesia [has confirmed that] a 14-year-old girl who died in June
2006 in South Sualwesi province was positive for avian influenza
[virus infection], Health Minister Siti Padila Supari said here on
Thursday [7 Sep 2006]. She said that the girl had a history of
contact with fowls, [and] at the time the authorities found many dead
chickens around the girl's residence.
The positive test result brought the total number of deaths from
avian influenza in Indonesia to 48 out of 63 people [who contracted
the disease], she said.
The total number of deaths from the highly pathogenic H5N1 in
Indonesia has surpassed the number in Viet Nam, making it the country
hardest hit by bird flu.

[There is some confusion in the reporting of these fatalities. An
Associated Press report cited in the China Post (Taiwan) describes
this case as a 14-year-old male from South Sulawesi's capital Makassa
and the 47th person to die from avian influenza virus infection in
Indonesia.
In the Antara News report above, a woman from South Sulawesi province
was identified as the 47th case.
Both were identified as avian influenza fatalities on the basis of
local laboratory tests, a practice now apparently endorsed by WHO.
However, confirmation of these results has yet to appear on the WHO
web-site. Clarification is awaited. - Mod.CP]
