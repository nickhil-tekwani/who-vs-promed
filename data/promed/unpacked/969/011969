Foot and mouth disease found in Shanghai
----------------------------------------
Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has been found in eastern China's Shanghai,
said the Ministry of Agriculture on Wednesday [11 Feb 2009]. On 3 Feb 2009,
41 milk cows developed symptoms of FMD in the Wusi cattle farm in Fengxian
district, on the outskirts of Shanghai, while the disease was confirmed by
national lab on Wednesday [11 Feb 2009].

Emergency measures were taken and some 440 cows in the cattle farm were
culled, Xinhua reported. No outbreak of the disease has been discovered
outside the cattle farm yet.

[Earlier this year (2009), China notified the OIE (Office International des
Epizooties; World Organisation for Animal Health) of outbreaks of FMD type
Asia 1 in Xinjiang (north western China) and of FMD type A in Hubei (mid
eastern China); see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090124.0318.

The serotyping of the current outbreak, further to the east, is expected.

The reporting of FMD outbreaks in 3 locations, from the far west to the
extreme eastern side of the Chinese subcontinent, may give rise to concern
that the disease might be underreported; additional foci may be expected.
