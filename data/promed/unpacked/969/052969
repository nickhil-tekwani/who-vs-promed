The mystery source of a salmonella outbreak that forced the closure of Sydney playgrounds and gave dozens of toddlers gastroenteritis may have been solved. Long-nosed bandicoots pooing in the sandpits may be the likely culprits, health investigators say.

3 children were hospitalized with severe diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain during the gastro outbreak on the northern beaches between 2007 and 2009. A further 72 people, mostly young children, became ill. The illness was blamed on the rare bacteria strain, _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Paratyphi B variant Java, found in some sandpits at public playgrounds and outdoor cafes around Pittwater. But health authorities could not determine the source of the salmonella. There were theories it came from dirty nappies, cockroaches or the feces of rats, ducks and ibis.

In a paper published in the US CDC's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, investigators from NSW Health said children ate the sand carrying the bacteria, which is normally associated with imported ornamental fish. The investigators found that a single central depot that delivers sand to playgrounds was a ''common factor'' in all contaminated playgrounds and that the depot was situated in a ''wild bushland setting''.

During tests of fecal and cloacal samples from 261 animals, the investigators found the salmonella strain in ducks, rats, possums and a dog, but by far ''the most were from a marsupial species native to the local area, the long-nosed bandicoot'', the paper said. ''Although sand from the central depot was a common factor in all contaminated playgrounds where case-patients contracted the illness, the infection source for this facility remains unknown,'' the paper said. ''It was located in a wild bushland setting, and it is feasible that transmission of the bacterium from local wildlife occurred.'' The authors wrote that their study identified accidental sand ingestion as a ''previously unrecognised pathway for humans acquiring illness caused by _S._ Java.''

NSW Health said the depot mentioned in the paper no longer distributes sand to any playgrounds.

[The L (+) tartrate + variant of _S._ Paratyphi B is sometimes referred to as _S._ Java. The classical _S._ Paratyphi B has the tartrate negative phenotype and is generally invasive causing an enteric fever-like illness similar to typhoid fever. Although the tartrate positive variant can be invasive, it generally is less invasive and is associated with diarrhea.

The long-nosed bandicoot (_Perameles nasuta_) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-nosed_bandicoot) is a species of bandicoot found in Australia. It is the largest member of its genus, which also includes the eastern barred bandicoot and the desert bandicoot. The long-nosed bandicoot is much less colourful than its relatives, being primarily a brown color. It is distributed along the eastern coast of Australia from Cairns in Queensland to Naringal in southwestern Victoria. It is a nocturnal, solitary predator of invertebrates and tubers.

The bandicoot (http://australian-animals.net/bandi.htm) has 2 features which place it apart from other Marsupials (mammals that carry their young in pouches):
1) Having many incisor teeth, as do all insect and flesh eating marsupials
2) Their second and third toes are grown together (like the kangaroo).

Bandicoots hop around like kangaroos on their larger hind legs though they are much smaller ranging from 6 inches to 22 inches in length. Depending on the species their fur can be orange, greyish, or brown or striped.
