Yellow fever in Venezuela
14 Sep 2004
-----------------
The WHO Regional Office for the Americas (AMRO) has received reports
of 2 laboratory-confirmed cases, including one death, of yellow fever
in Venezuela. The cases occurred in the 2nd half of August 2004, in
the Municipality of Sucre, Merida State.
A team from the Ministry of Health was quickly deployed to
investigate the area and organized a catch-up vaccination campaign to
prevent the occurrence of cases.
During 2003, Venezuela started a programme to vaccinate 10 million
people in 17 states considered to be at risk from yellow fever.
Specific surveillance procedures are in place to detect sporadic
cases and implement outbreak control measures in a timely manner.

[A suspected case of yellow fever who died in Merida (also in Sucre) in
August 2004 was described previously in the ProMED-mail post " Yellow fever
- Venezuela (Merida) 20040902.2449". This case was reported to have died on
14 Aug 2004. The WHO report states that the two laboratory confirmed cases
referred to above occurred in the second half of August. Clarification of
the precise number of confirmed yellow fever cases reported from Merida
state so far in 2004 would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
