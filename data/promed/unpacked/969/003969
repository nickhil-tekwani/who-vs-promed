To add more to the dying bird and fish mysteries,
a report came out today that around 1500
endangered and protected 'Sooty Shearwater'
(_Puffinus griseus_) birds have been found dead in the coast of Chile.

Near the sectors of Mela and Colmuyao, officials
found nearly 1500 dead birds and are puzzled as to why they have died.

Chile has had reports of thousands of the
endangered Shearwater birds mysteriously dying.
What was attributed to a possible poisoning by a
plant species that was re-introduced, the website
ElMostrador.cl reported the death of the birds
last year. Almost no one else heard about it.
Just a few days ago, Chilean officials found more
of these dead birds and the media was quick to jump on it.

Hopefully officials have sent some of the
carcasses to a veterinary diagnostic lab for
testing to determine what is causing the dieÂ­off. - Mod.TG]
