The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) urged people to keep their bird feeders clean and free of bacteria so wild birds stay healthy this winter. Calls to ODFW from Oregon bird lovers seeing dead birds in their yard and around their feeders are increasing with colder weather, the agency said.

Testing by the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory identified the cause of one recent bird die-off at a feeder in Corvallis as a bacterial infection from salmonella.

_Salmonella_, _E. coli_ and other bacteria along with viruses, parasites and fungal diseases can be passed by congregating birds at feeders that don't get cleaned regularly. When the weather turns cold, the energy demands on birds and other wildlife increase dramatically so a high energy seed meal at a bird feeder will bring in birds and congregate them, increasing the chance of disease transmission.

Pine siskins, nuthatches, chickadees and other seed-eating backyard birds are some of the most common species affected by these diseases. The birds get infected at the feeders and pass the infection on when they come into contact with feeder surfaces, perches or visit multiple feeders.

"We ask those Oregonians who enjoy seeing birds and feeding them in winter to provide a clean and healthy environment for their feathered visitors," said Dr. Colin Gillin, ODFW state wildlife veterinarian. "When you feed birds, be sure to start with clean feeders and to disinfect feeders periodically. This way, Oregon's wildlife will stay healthy and both birds and bird watchers will benefit."

[It would be important to know which strain of _Salmonella_ is implicated, as of that depends its zoonotic potential, or the risk to domestic animals. A commonly isolated salmonella from passerine birds is _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Typhimurium which can cause diarrhea in humans and livestock. - Mod.PMB
