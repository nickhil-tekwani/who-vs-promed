The Hospital Authority said that a 7-year-old girl who travelled to Shanghai at the end of last month [March 2013] had developed a fever and flu symptoms. She was in quarantine in Queen Elizabeth Hospital's paediatric department. But officials revealed the tests for the H7N9 strain were negative shortly before midnight.

The news emerged as it was announced the virus had claimed its 6th victim, a 64-year-old farmer from Huzhou, Zhejiang province. He was confirmed to have the virus on Thursday [4 Apr 2013] and died that night.

Health officials in Jiangsu said on Friday [5 Apr 2013] that 2 new cases had been confirmed in the provincial capital Nanjing. One was a 61-year-old woman, said to be in a critical condition, and the other a 79-year-old man in a serious condition. The cases take the total number of people confirmed to have been infected in the Yangtze River Delta region to 16.

In Shanghai, markets trading in live poultry will be closed temporarily and sales of live birds suspended elsewhere, said municipal government spokesman Xu Wei. More than 20 000 birds were culled on Friday [5 Apr 2013] at the Huhuai Farm Products Market in the city where the H7N9 virus was detected in a pigeon sample on Thursday [4 Apr 2013]. Shao Linchu, deputy director of Shanghai's Agricultural Commission, said: "The government will pay compensation to the vendors of at least 50 per cent of the market price of the poultry slaughtered."

The WHO said yesterday [5 Apr 2013] there was no sign of a sustained spread of the H7N9 virus.

6 suspect cases of [avian influenza virus infection] were reported in Taiwan and tested for the H7N9 strain, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced yesterday [5 Apr 2013], adding that 4 of the cases [strains] were not H7N9 and 2 are still to be [identified].

CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hau said on Thursday [4 Apr 2013] that 6 people reported fever symptoms after arriving in Taiwan from China recently. 2 of them were infected with the H1N1 influenza, 2 people had bacterial infections, while diagnoses for 2 people was yet be confirmed.

Chou said the 2 people awaiting results -- a Taiwanese and a Chinese -- had been to Shanghai and Jiangsu province respectively. Both areas are considered H7N9-infected areas.

According to the CDC, 20 passengers from China, Hong Kong, and Macau were found to have fever symptoms upon arrival at Taiwan's airports on Thursday [4 Apr 2013]. These passengers, however, were not coming from infected areas, such as Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu, or Zhejiang. Those 20 people therefore do not need to be quarantined, the CDC said, adding that health officials have told the 20 passengers to keep monitoring their own health conditions.
