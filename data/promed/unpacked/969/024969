BSE NEWS AND INFORMATION
SERVICE ON THE INTERNET
March 29, 1996
A Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) news and information service has been
launched on the Internet today (Friday, March 29 1996) by CAB INTERNATIONAL,
Wallingford, Oxon, UK.
Users will be able to access the latest BSE news as reported in the
scientific, technical and medical press that appears in the latest issue of
Public Health News.
In addition, we are providing free access to more than 300 free records on the
main scientific literature published on BSE in the last 6 years. The
information is from the CAB ABSTRACTS database which is compiled by subject
specialists from the world's scientific, veterinary, medical and agricultural
literature.
The records include a bibliographic citation and most have an abstract of the
original paper. All the records are available to view or download. To view the
BSE news and information service, go to the CAB INTERNATIONAL homepage at
http://www.cabi.org/ and press the 'What's New and What's Free' button.
Further scientific information on BSE and related topics, such as scrapie,
prions, prion disease and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies can
be found on the CAB ABSTRACTS database.
There are more than 1400 references on these topics from the last 12 years
alone. The CAB ABSTRACTS database can be searched via the Internet on major
online hosts such as DataStar, Dialog, DIMDI, STN and BIDS.
