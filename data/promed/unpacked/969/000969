Recently, a number of media and social media circulated news that a number of cows were suspected of being infected with blue tongue [BT] disease in the Wilayat of El Kef.

In a statement to Mosaique, the Director of Animal Health in the General Administration of Veterinary Services at the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Wafaa bin Hamouda, denied today, Thursday [18 Aug 2022], the infection of any cow or sheep with blue tongue disease, stressing that the 4 cases of cows that were registered and confirmed in the laboratory were diagnosed as having Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease [EHD], the symptoms of which being similar to blue tongue disease. The cases were recorded in El Kef, Seliana and Jendouba governorates.

Ben Hamouda indicated that EHD is a viral disease that affects domestic ruminants and deer, stressing that the disease has only affected cows so far. He also highlighted that EHD is caused by a virus that, similarly to BT, is also transmitted through insects, and that its 1st cases were recorded in Tunisia in 2006.

According to Ben Hamouda, the most important symptoms of this disease are high temperatures in the animal [cattle], redness of the eye membranes, swelling of the animal's head, in addition to a runny nose and mouth.

Ben Hamouda recommended that breeders, when they suspect that their livestock is infected with an epidemic bleeding disease, first call the veterinary services of the regional delegation of agriculture to take the necessary samples and send them to the laboratory to diagnose the case, and then secondly, seek the assistance of a special veterinarian who will undertake the case and prescribe the necessary medication.

Ben Hamouda explained that, in order to try prevent this disease, cattle should not be exposed to the vector during its active hours, namely late afternoon/sunset and early morning/sunrise, in addition to observing hygiene practices, treating stables on a regular basis with non-permanent and approved insecticides, and removing any pool of water.

[Posting 20220819.8705087, dated 19 Aug 2022, addressed 4 clinically diagnosed cases of EHD in cattle. The posting included the following RFI: "Information from knowledgeable sources in the area on the definitive diagnosis (EHD or Bluetongue) and the serotype of the virus behind the current cattle disease in Tunisia will be appreciated". Radio Mosaic's report, above, provides the sought information on the lab confirmation of the cases. The serotype remains to be established/published.

The confirmation of EHD does not necessarily exclude the possibility that BTV is circulating in Tunisia as well: both are orbiviruses transmitted by the same vector (culicoide midges). BTV is specifically pathogenic for sheep. Cattle, though readily infected, mostly remain subclinical.

Notably, during the seasons of 2021 and 2006, both viruses were circulating, clinically affecting their respective susceptible animal species.

BTV affected Tunisia's sheep, in previous events (2002, 2006, 2009, 2018, 2021), particularly during the months of October-November. - Mod.AS
