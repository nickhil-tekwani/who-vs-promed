The Singapore Polo Club and a saddle club have been quarantined after
5 horses showed signs of respiratory viral disease, authorities said
on Sunday [23 Sep 2007]. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority
(AVA) told Channel NewsAsia samples are being tested to determine
whether the animals have equine influenza.
The ailment spread across horse farms in Australia recently. The 5
horses showing signs of viral disease are at the polo club.
Races will go on as usual, said the Singapore Turf Club, but it is
restricting contact with horses and access to areas including the
horse-walk, parade ring, and winning enclosure, the report said. Only
staff, trainers and jockeys will be allowed in these areas. Staff who
have been to the polo or Bukit Kimah Saddle Club in the last 3 days
have been barred from entering the turf club's stable premises.

[The disease can spread easily. One hopes they are taking more
biosecurity measures than merely barring some staff who have been at
the turf club's stable premises. One also hopes they have started a
vaccination program to protect the other horses.
