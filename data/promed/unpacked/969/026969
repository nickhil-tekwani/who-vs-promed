Today's dispatch from Brazil reports 320 cases and one death from an
epidemic of cholera in the town of Cortes, located in Brazil's northeast,
announced by Pernambuco state health officials. The total number of cases
in the state stands at 550.
Contaminated water from the Serinhaem river is cited as the source of the
infection. Cortes authorities have declared a public emergency and are
inspecting the water purification plant in the town.
"The public is frightened," said Sister Dalva dos Santos from the Cortes
parish office. Clinics in the region do not have enough doctors and
hospital beds to cope with the outbreak.

Cholera in Brazil
---------------------
According to data from the National Centre for Epidemiology of the Ministry
of Health in Brazil, 376 cases of cholera have been notified between 12 and
23 November 1998, 24 of which have been laboratory-confirmed. The cases are
occurring in the urban area of Cortez municipality (which has a population
of approximately 13 000) in the region of Mata-Sul, Pernambuco State, in
north-eastern Brazil. The source of contamination is thought to be the Rio
Sirinhaem, from which 80% of the water used by the population originates.
The Health Department, in collaboration with water and sanitation
authorities from the State of Pernambuco are coordinating epidemiological
surveillance, health education activities, water chlorination and case
management. The medical team will be reinforced with professionals from
other States. Supplies for the treatment of patients are in place and the
central laboratory is active in the area. Suspected cases have been
notified in neighbouring areas, but without confirmation. This cholera
outbreak is the first to be reported in Brazil in l998.
