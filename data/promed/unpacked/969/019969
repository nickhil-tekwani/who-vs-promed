Biosecurity threat investigation
--------------------------------
Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) director of biosecurity Barry
O'Neil said today that MAF and the police were responding to a claimed
deliberate release of foot and mouth virus on Waiheke Island. Mr O'Neil
said the claim, advised by letter to the Prime Minister's Office this
morning, was probably a hoax but was being taken very seriously.
MAF has activated its disease management response systems this afternoon
after the letter was received. As part of this precautionary response, a
controlled area notice has been issued which restricts the movement of
livestock and risk material on and from the island while the investigation
proceeds. There are no restrictions on people travelling to or from Waiheke
Island.
A controlled area notice has been issued under the provisions of the
Biosecurity Act in order to restrict the movement of risk material. Risk
materials include live animals, hay, equipment used with animals, untreated
products from animals, milk, cheese, meat and wool.
Mr O'Neil said the notice took effect this afternoon. He stressed the
importance of securing the full cooperation of everyone in the area in
dealing with the situation. He emphasised that there was no risk to public
safety or public health. Foot and mouth disease only affects ruminant
animals, such as sheep, cattle and pigs.
Police assistant commissioner Peter Marshall said anyone with any
information that might assist enquiries was encouraged to contact their
nearest police station immediately. Senior ministers and officials have
been briefed and a police inquiry into the origin of the letter has been
launched.
"While this matter is probably a hoax we must take all necessary steps to
safeguard New Zealand's interests and public welfare," Mr. O'Neil said. "As
a precautionary measure, we are also taking steps to advise key industry
participants in New Zealand and overseas of this claimed foot and mouth
virus release."
We have since updated this to outline further details of the investigation,
and our press releases can be found on both

FMD news: New Zealand -- FMD risk to exports (follow-up)
---------------------
Summary: A letter sent to the Prime Minister claims FMD has already been
released on Waiheke Island. It sought money and a change in the country's
tax policies, and threatened another release of the disease elsewhere this
week. An investigation has been launched and biosecurity director Barry
O'Neil says major trading partners are being informed. He says exotic
disease staff have placed a restricted area notice on the island where
there are 18 000 sheep and 2500 cattle. It could be weeks before Waiheke
Island knows whether it is clear of FMD, as the animals will be tested
every 48 hours until disease can be ruled out, which may be 2 weeks. He
says they are also tracing all livestock and risk material that has left
the island in the past 24 hours. Farmers are being warned not to panic over
the bioterrorism claim.

FMD News: New Zealand -- farmers left in the dark over FMD threat (follow-up)
---------------------
Summary: Waiheke farmers were left in the dark about the FMD scare,
learning about the possible threat to their livestock from news reports.
Their reactions were low-key as they waited for more information. At
Waiheke Station, Neville Dick was waiting for some kind of official word.
"I've had a few calls from journalists, but haven't heard from MAF." "Some
people get off on the thought that there'll be a panic, just to scare the
locals. I'm 95 per cent certain it will be a hoax," said Mr Walker, who has
lived on the island for 30 years. Another farm owner was also sure it would
be a hoax. "Ridiculous, it's a lot of nonsense." Waiheke veterinarian John
Hewitt said no one had reported sick animals.
