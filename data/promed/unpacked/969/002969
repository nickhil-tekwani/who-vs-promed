Study: 56% of omicron-infected adults didn't know they were contagious
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An observational study of 210 adults in California with detectable SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during an omicron variant wave shows that 56% didn't know they had been infected, fueling concerns about asymptomatic transmission, according to a report today [17 Aug 2022] in JAMA Network Open. [Sandy Y. Joung, Joseph E. Ebinger, Nancy Sun, et al. Awareness of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron Variant Infection Among Adults With Recent COVID-19 Seropositivity. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(8):e2227241. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.27241]

Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center led the study of adult employees and patients of the hospital in Los Angeles County who had at least 2 SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests 1 month or more apart. The 1st test occurred after the delta variant surge on 15 Sep 2021, and the 2nd was conducted amid the omicron wave from 15 Dec 2021 to 4 May 2022. Participants also completed surveys on vaccinations, viral exposures, and symptoms at baseline and throughout the study.

The investigators called the study the first to assess omicron infection awareness, which is key to timely self-isolation, in a diverse urban area in the United States.

10% had symptoms ascribed to cold, other illness
------------------------------------------------
Among the 210 participants, median age was 51 years, 65% were women, 44% knew they had a recent omicron infection, and 56% said they didn't know they were infected. Of the 118 participants who were unaware of their infection, 12 (10%) said they had symptoms but had attributed them to a common cold or other non-COVID infection.

A multivariable analysis showed that overall awareness was low but that center employees were more likely than patients to know they were infected (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.46).

"This finding may be explained not only by the differences in general health awareness and literacy between employees and nonemployees but also by the mandatory daily screening protocols for employees that are supported by COVID-19 sick pay policies, which were broadened at the institution during the omicron variant surge," the study authors wrote.

Among the 92 participants who were aware of their infection, 67 (73%) had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result recorded in their electronic health record, self-reported the result, or both.

An unadjusted analysis showed that participants who knew they were infected were more likely to be younger than those who were unaware (47 vs 53 years). Men were also more likely than women to know they were infected (OR, 1.87).

"If these results are found to be generalizable, they could be associated with the tendency of certain individuals to develop a greater symptomatic response or more severe forms of omicron variant infection," the authors wrote. "The extent to which self-reported awareness of omicron variant or symptoms of infection appeared lower in older participants could be associated with worse recall in survey assessments."

Of the 92 participants who knew about their omicron infection, 62 (67%) indicated their awareness on a survey, with 56 (90%) reporting COVID-attributable symptoms and 6 (10%) reporting no symptoms.

Before SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected, 94% of participants had received a COVID-19 vaccine, and 93% of previously vaccinated participants had completed a series with at least one mRNA vaccine.

Role of antibody testing
------------------------
The researchers noted that while general access to COVID-19 testing may have improved over time, omicron has been linked to milder illness than that caused by previous SARS-CoV-2 strains. The milder nature of the infection may have led infected people to unknowingly spread the virus.

"Lack of awareness of omicron variant infection, either owing to the relative absence of symptoms or lack of timely testing, likely had a role in rapid transmission within the communities in Los Angeles County," they wrote.

They added that antibody testing can complement rapid antigen testing and household and wastewater surveillance programs in understanding trends in vulnerability to emerging SARS-CoV-2 strains.

"The greater availability and use of rapid antigen testing could be associated with augmented awareness and, in turn, reduced rates of person-to-person transmission of the omicron variant," the researchers concluded. "Further studies are needed to more completely understand the factors associated with unawareness of infectious status, particularly factors that could be mitigated by available interventions."

[Question: What proportion of individuals who recently contracted the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant were aware of their infectious status?

Findings: In this cohort study of 210 adults with evidence of seroconversion during a regional omicron variant surge, 56% reported being unaware of any recent omicron variant infection.

Meaning: Findings of this study suggest that low rates of omicron variant infection awareness may be a key contributor to rapid transmission of the virus within communities. (from https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2795246)]

Study suggests test-to-stay COVID-19 strategy in schools was effective
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Using a test-to-stay (TTS) strategy in K-12 schools during the winter of 2021-22 resulted in substantial reduction in missed school days, according to a study yesterday [16 Aug 2022] in Pediatrics.

The study, led by researchers from Duke University, looked at the impact of TTS on North Carolina schools where masking was considered optional and the omicron variant became the dominant strain in the United States.

The study enrolled 1675 participants. Students and staff who were eligible for enrollment had a non-household exposure to SARS-CoV-2 within or outside of school from 29 Nov 2021, to 28 Jan 2022, as identified through the school contact-tracing program, and were not experiencing symptoms at the time of enrollment. Those enrolled were required to test using rapid antigen tests on the day they were notified of exposure, on day 3, and on day 5.

Researchers identified 201 positive cases and a tertiary attack rate of 10% (95% confidence interval, 6% to 19%). A total of 7272 (89%) of potentially missed days were saved through the TTS strategy.

"We estimated one additional school-acquired case for every 21 TTS participants remaining in school buildings during the entire study period," the authors concluded. "Based on our data, a TTS approach allows more students and staff to remain in the classroom, with a modest increase in subsequent infections in optionally masked settings, even during the circulation of a highly transmissible variant."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Objectives: We evaluated the impact of a test-to-stay (TTS) program on within-school transmission and missed school days in optionally masked kindergarten through 12th grade schools during a period of high community severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission.

Methods: Close contacts of those with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were eligible for enrollment in the TTS program if exposure to a non-household contact occurred between 29 Nov 2021 and 28 Jan 2022. Consented participants avoided school exclusion if they remained asymptomatic and rapid antigen testing at pre-specified intervals remained negative. Primary outcomes included within-school tertiary attack rate (test positivity among close contacts of positive TTS participants) and school days saved among TTS participants. We estimated the number of additional school-acquired cases resulting from TTS and eliminating school exclusion.

Results: A total of 1675 participants tested positive or received at least one negative test between days 5 and 7, and completed follow-up; 92% were students and 91% were exposed to an unmasked primary case. We identified 201 positive cases. We observed a tertiary attack rate of 10% (95% CI 6-19%) and 7272 (89%) of potentially missed days were saved through TTS implementation. We estimated one additional school-acquired case for every 21 TTS participants remaining in school buildings during the entire study period.

Conclusions: Even in the setting of high community transmission, a TTS strategy resulted in substantial reduction in missed school days in optionally masked schools.]

Universal healthcare coverage tied to COVID-19 childhood vaccine uptake
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Countries with more progress toward universal healthcare coverage (UHC) saw smaller decreases in childhood vaccination amid the health service delivery disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests preliminary research published yesterday [16 Aug 2022] in PLOS Medicine.

Using a difference-in-difference design, New York University researchers quantified the relationship between UHC and childhood vaccination rates among 195 countries and their ability to provide 12 of 14 vaccines from 2010 to 2020.

A total of 20 230 country-year observations were included, 1658 of which occurred after the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. The data were derived from the World Health Organization/UNICEF Joint Estimates of National Immunization Coverage, and the 2019 UHC Service Coverage Index was used to classify countries' progress toward UHC.

The team found that, after adjustment, countries with a UHC index score of 80 or higher observed a 2.7% smaller drop in childhood vaccination in 2020 than those with lower scores. Before the pandemic, countries with a high UHC index had an average childhood vaccination uptake of 92.7%, compared with 86.2% in lower-UHC countries. In the 1st year of the pandemic, countries with a high UHC index realized a coverage rate of 91.9%, versus 81.7% in lower-UHC countries.

"Countries' health system resilience against public health emergencies has been studied almost exclusively under the framework of global health security (GHS), with no role of UHC discussed," the researchers wrote. "This clear separation of investigations has precluded the opportunity to examine the potential contribution of UHC in strengthening health system resilience against external shocks."

In a PLOS news release, senior author Yesim Tozan, PhD, noted that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the delivery of essential health services worldwide. "This study provided the much-needed quantitative evidence of the protective effects of universal health coverage in times of public health crises, underpinning the policy recommendations for sustained political commitment and investments for universal health coverage to build resilient health systems," she said.

PLoS Med 19(8): e1004060. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1004060

PLoS news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/961703):

... In the new study, researchers used the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment to compare differences in childhood immunization coverage based on countries' progress toward UHC. Immunization data were derived from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Estimates of National Immunization Coverage dataset, which includes information on 195 countries and 14 childhood vaccines between 1997 and 2020. The 2019 UHC Service Coverage Index (UHC SCI), a measure that represents indicators of coverage for a range of health services across the lifespan, was used to divide countries into a "high UHC index" group and the rest. ...

"Our findings strongly suggest that policymakers should continue to advocate for policies aimed at achieving universal health coverage in coming years," the authors say. "This study also sets the stage for future research in understanding the synergistic impact of investments in global health security and universal health coverage strategies on countries' health system resilience."

"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the delivery of essential health services across countries worldwide," Tozan adds.

[3] Exhaled virus

How much virus does a person with COVID exhale? New research has answers
------------------------------------------------------------------------
People infected with the highly transmissible alpha, delta and omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 spew out higher amounts of virus than those infected with other variants, according to a new study(1). Further, individuals who contract COVID-19 after vaccination, and even after a booster dose, still shed virus into the air.

The work was posted on the medRxiv preprint server on 29 July 2022. It has not yet been peer reviewed. [Lai, J. et al. Preprint at medRxiv https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.07.27.22278121].

"This research showed that all 3 of those variants that have won the infection race ... come out of the body more efficiently when people talk or shout than the earliest strains of the coronavirus," says John Volckens, a public-health engineer at Colorado State University in Fort Collins.

Study co-author Kristen Coleman, who researches emerging infectious diseases at the University of Maryland in College Park, says this means that people should be "pushing governments to invest in improving indoor air quality by improving ventilation and filtration systems".

Breathe out
-----------
For the study, Coleman and her colleagues recruited 93 people between mid-2020 and early 2022 who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. Participants' infections were caused by strains including the alpha variant, which emerged in late 2020, and the later delta and omicron variants. All participants with the latter 2 strains had been fully vaccinated before catching the virus.

The infected people faced into a cone-shaped apparatus and sang and shouted -- with inevitable coughs and sneezes in between -- for 30 minutes, while an attached machine collected the particles they exhaled. The device, called a Gesundheit-II, separated out the fine 'aerosol' droplets measuring 5 micrometres or less in diameter, which can linger in the air and leak through cloth and surgical masks.

The team found that participants infected with the alpha, delta and omicron variants emitted significantly more viral RNA when exhaling than did people infected with other variants. These include ancestral variants, such as the one 1st detected in Wuhan, China, and those not associated with increased transmissibility -- such as gamma, which arose in late 2020. For participants with delta and omicron, their fine aerosol contained on average 5 times the amount of virus that was detected in their larger, coarse aerosol.

The team also seeded cells in the laboratory with aerosol samples and found that 4 samples, each from a participant with either delta or omicron, infected the cells. Shed virus is not always infectious, says study co-author Jianyu Lai, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland, and the samples' ability to infect laboratory cells means that viral RNA in exhaled aerosols can spread the disease.

Malin Alsved, an aerosol technology scientist at Lund University in Sweden, says: "I'm bit concerned that they mix all the respiratory [aerosols] -- they have breathing, talking, speaking, screaming, coughing, even sneezing in the sample." Coleman responds that the team combined respiratory samples to mimic a real-life scenario such as being in a restaurant.

Going viral
-----------
The study also highlights the variation between individuals in the amounts of exhaled virus, which ranged from non-detectable levels to those associated with 'superspreaders'. One omicron-infected participant, for example, shed 1000 times as much viral RNA through fine aerosol as the maximum level observed in those with alpha or delta. The researchers say that the root of these discrepancies remains a mystery but could be related to biological factors such as a person's age. Behaviour might play a part, too: the study's superspreader coughed more frequently than others.

If new variants are more prone to superspreading, that might drive them to dominate COVID-19 cases. The team notes that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhale much lower amounts of viral RNA than people infected with influenza, a comparable airborne disease. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could spin off variants that transmit even more virus.

"That is something to be concerned about," says Alsved.

[Since SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense RNA virus (family Coronaviridae; genus Betacoronavirus), the RNA can act as its own messenger upon infecting a cell, and initiate replication. The messenger RNA (mRNA), is used to synthesize polyproteins which are subsequently cleaved into individual proteins by viral or cellular proteases. In the course of this process, new genomic RNA molecules are generated. Therefore, exhaled RNA can be infectious if it encounters susceptible cells. Ample ventilation can interfere with this occurrence. Schools, nursing homes, theatres and other places where people gather in number should focus on upgrading ventilation and air flow to limit spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. - Mod.LK]
