[2] News report
Date: Fri 9 Jul 2010

The Japanese government will decide early next week [week of 12 Jul
2010] whether to slaughter 6 privately owned stud bulls, despite the
owner's objection, to prevent the spread of FMD in Miyazaki
Prefecture, a senior government official said Friday [9 Jul 2010].

"The Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry cannot change its
position that the bulls should be slaughtered as recommended by the
prefecture's government," the ministry's Senior Vice Minister Takashi
Shinohara said. "But the owner's feelings should also be taken into
account."

The prefecture's Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru earlier expressed hope
that the prefectural government would take over and save the stud
bulls as an exception.

The owner in the town of Takanabe has rejected the prefectural
government's earlier recommendation to vaccinate and slaughter the
stud bulls, while most of the livestock have been slaughtered in the
town and its vicinity since the FMD outbreak in April [2010].

The prefectural government plans to lift the livestock transport
restrictions on Takanabe and its vicinity by 16 Jul 2010 and those on
the city of Miyazaki by 27 Jul 2010 if no new case of the disease is
found. Such restrictions on other places in the prefecture have
already been lifted.

[In case no new outbreaks are detected, Japan will be eligible to
reinstate its FMD-free status -- in line with article 8.5.8. of OIE's
terrestrial Animal Health Code -- 3 months after 5 Jul 2010 (the date
its last infected and vaccinated animals were stamped out). This,
provided serological surveillance is applied in accordance with
Articles 8.5.40 to 8.5.46 of the Code.

Refraining from killing the 6 stud bulls, described above, without
affecting the said timetable, may be considered provided the bulls
have not been vaccinated and are not serologically positive. - Mod.AS]
