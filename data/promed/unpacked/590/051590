Re the official report to WHO by Japan of 18 cases & 18 (?) deaths from
cholera from 27 Jan-22 Jun 2004 (see ProMED ref. at end), a correspondent
sends the following information from the above official source:
Jan 29 no cases
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/kanja/idwr/idwr2004-04.pdf> page19
Feb 5 4 cases
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/kanja/idwr/idwr2004-05.pdf> page21
June 24 26 cases
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/kanja/idwr/idwr2004-25.pdf> page26
giving a total of 30 cases, with no indication of any fatalities.
For those who don't read Japanese but can download the font, cholera is in
the 6th column from the left, the left side gives reported cases for the week
and right side is the cumulative number of cases for this year.
There is some discordance between these figures and those given in the
English section of the website which, however, has only been updated to April
(or in one case May) 2004:
Bacteria from DOMESTIC cases (Prefectural/municipal public health
institutes and health centers) Diarrhegenic bacteria and protozoa
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/index.html>
No cases of _V.cholerae_ from January through April 2004
Bacteria from IMPORTED cases (Prefectural/municipal public health institutes
and health centers) <http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/index.html>
1 case each month of _V.cholerae_ O1 Eltor Inaba (CT+) in January, February
& April 2004
Imported cases by visiting country/area (Quarantine Stations) in April 2004 -
May 2004
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/virus/graph/i2928.gif>
1 case from each country of _V. cholerae_ non-O1 non-O139 from Thailand &
Pakistan
