Malaria epidemic in eastern Bangladesh
--------------------------------------------------
Malaria, the killer disease that broke out in an epidemic form in
Bandarban, Rangamati and Khagrachari hill districts, claimed lives of about
96 people and affected about 50 000 others during the last month, reports
BSS. Health department sources said children and women were the worst
affected and they died within 24 hours of the attack with cerebral
malaria. The treatment and medicine supply seriously hampered the
treatment of malaria patients due to shortage of doctors and insufficient
supply of medicine from the authorities of the three hill districts.
According to hospital sources, in Bandarban hill district about 32 people
died of malaria in seven hospitals and different areas of the district
during the month. During the period about 17 000 people were affected by
malaria and they got treatment from hospitals and private clinics in the
district.
In Rangamati district, about 36 people died of malaria in 10 hospitals and
different areas of the district in the last month. About 23 000 people were
affected by malaria and they also got treatment from hospitals and other
private clinics here.
In Khagrachhari district, about 28 people died of malaria in eight
hospitals and private clinics in the district during the last month. About
10 000 others were affected by malaria and they got treatment from
different hospitals and private clinics in the district. Local leaders and
public representatives claimed that the killer malaria has been spreading
at new villages in the hilly region. They said about 200 people including
child and woman died of malaria in the three hill districts during the last
month.

[The three affected districts are located in the eastern part of Bangladesh
where resistance to both chloroquine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine has been
found. The last major malaria epidemic occurred in Bangladesh in 1993. 60
percent of cases are Plasmodium falciparum. The latest data from 1998 show
60 000 laboratory confirmed cases for the whole year, so the 50 000 cases
registered in one month reported here represent a huge increase ­ if
confirmed. More information from official sources would be appreciated. ­
