A pregnant woman ended up in the emergency room after she says she received food poisoning from eating tuna she bought at a Longmont Sprouts store.

The victim said both Sprouts and the vendor that supplied the tuna aren't doing anything about it. Now, she's demanding someone be held accountable.

On Halloween night, Bradley went to the Sprouts on Hover street in Longmont and bought some tuna from the deli for her family. "It's what we had about an hour before I went to the ER," she said.

Doctors at the emergency room diagnosed her with scombroid toxin poisoning, which is a type of food poisoning caused by eating rotten fish.

"I was a fire truck for Halloween, my face was totally red," the victim said. "I started getting the shakes at the E.R."

The victim said her husband and 17-month-old daughter got sick, too. But what she was concerned with most was her pregnancy.

"There's not a lot of information for this type of seafood poisoning or the [effect] it has on the fetus," she said.

The grocery chain tried to give her a USD 50 gift card and told her the fish would be removed and returned for testing to Harvest Meat, the vendor that supplied the tuna.

However, she that said when she contacted Harvest Meats Wednesday [15 Nov 2017] it was the 1st time the company had heard of the incident, and a representative said it had not received any fish back from the store.

Sprouts told Denver7 it is investigating what went wrong. A company representative said it has not received any other complaints similar to the victim's and could not confirm whether the fish has been removed from the deli case.

The victim wants the company to pay for her medical expenses, which have reached over USD 2000. But more importantly, she hopes what happened to her doesn't happen to anyone else.

[It is unusual that this deli sells a lot of tuna, yet there is only one report of a poisoning. Did she handle the tuna properly or go on other errands without refrigerating the tuna. Or did she mix it with some long leftover tuna upon returning home? There aren't other cases. There should have been other families or individuals involved. At the moment, this case seems a little suspect.

"What is scombroid fish poisoning?
Scombroid fish poisoning is a syndrome resembling an allergic reaction that occurs within a few hours of eating fish contaminated with histamine. There are no specific diagnostic tests for scombroid fish poisoning in humans, and diagnosis is generally made based on symptoms and recent dietary history.

What are the symptoms of scombroid fish poisoning?
Illness typically begins minutes to hours after ingestion of the toxic fish and resembles a histamine reaction. Associated symptoms include tingling and burning sensations around the mouth, facial flushing and sweating, nausea and vomiting, headache, palpitations, dizziness and rash. Some patients report that the implicated fish has a peppery or a metallic taste.

How do people get scombroid fish poisoning?
Fish in the Scombridae family (tuna, mackerel, skipjack and bonito) are the most common vehicles for scombroid fish poisoning. Other fish, however, have been implicated in scombroid fish poisoning, and include mahi mahi, bluefish, marlin, and escolar. When susceptible fish are not promptly and continuously refrigerated, bacteria can metabolize naturally occurring histamine to produce scombrotoxin, which consists of histamine and other amines. The presence of 50 parts per million (ppm) or more histamine in fish is indicative of decomposition whether or not there is gross evidence of spoilage, such as bad odor. When illness results from consumption, histamine levels in implicated fish have commonly been at least 200 ppm and often greater than 500 ppm. Histamine is heat resistant and can, therefore, cause illness even when fish is properly canned or cooked thoroughly. While some contaminated fish will not show any outward signs of spoilage, others will show such signs as a bad odor. Cooked fish that has spoiled may have a "honey combed" appearance.

How is scombroid fish poisoning treated?
Scombroid fish poisoning is usually mild and duration is short, making treatment unnecessary. For more severe cases or inpatients with underlying medical conditions, oral antihistamines may be beneficial.

How common is scombroid fish poisoning?
The occurrence of scombroid fish poisoning is worldwide. In California, scombroid fish poisoning is reportable; in 1999 and 2000, there were 17 and 26 cases of scombroid fish poisoning reported in California, respectively."
