[1] Cases spiking

Latest data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show cases of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus, are spiking in the United States.

RSV usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms, but can be dangerous for some infants and young children, according to the CDC.

Surveillance data collected by the CDC clearly shows a rise in RSV cases nationwide in recent weeks, with cases detected by PCR tests more than tripling over the past 2 months.

Now, there is an "unprecedented" rise in RSV cases among children in the United States, said a CNN report.

The CDC's surveillance program captures data from 75 counties representing about 9 percent of the total US population.

["Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) causes severe acute respiratory infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals (1). There are 2 antigenic subgroups of HRSV, HRSV-A, and HRSV-B. Most infants experience a primary HRSV infection in their 1st 2 years of life (1,2). In 15 to 50% of the cases, this results in a lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) such as bronchiolitis or pneumonia, leading to hospitalization in 1 to 3% of the infants (3). The burden of HRSV is substantial in the elderly as well; at least 10% of winter hospitalizations are due to HRSV, with a case fatality rate of almost 10% (4). HRSV infection does not lead to protective immunity, and reinfections can occur throughout life (5,6). Treatment options for HRSV are limited. Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the HRSV fusion (F) glycoprotein and is used as prophylaxis but is expensive and only given to infants at high risk (7,8). Recently, another humanized monoclonal antibody against HRSV was developed (nirsevimab) (9). Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, is an approved drug for treating HRSV infection, but its effectiveness is disputed (10). Despite many efforts to develop an HRSV vaccine, none have been licensed (11).

"HRSV is predominantly transmitted via direct contact or large droplets and targets epithelial cells in the respiratory tract (12). HRSV replication and the ensuing host inflammatory response can lead to damage of the epithelial layer. Exposure usually results in an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and symptoms include congestion, sneezing, and rhinorrhea (2,13). In some cases, HRSV spreads to the lower respiratory tract and infects ciliated epithelial cells of the bronchi and terminal bronchioles (14,15). Subsequent epithelial damage, combined with an influx of white blood cells and mucus production, can lead to mucus plugging and occlusion of the airway lumina. This results in airway obstruction and air trapping, causing apnea, difficulty breathing, and wheezing. This effect is most pronounced in infants, where the airways are still exceptionally small (13,14). Complications in adults are associated with acute bronchitis, pneumonia, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma. Where severe HRSV disease in infants is often associated with immune hyperresponsiveness, in adults, it is associated with hyporesponsiveness, which could be caused by compromised or waning immunity (1,2)."

"Two HRSV subgroups, HRSV-A and HRSV-B, cocirculate globally. Although both can cause severe HRSV disease, HRSV-A strains are typically associated with more severe disease than HRSV-B strains (26)."

[2] Tripledemic: COVID, Flu, RSV
Date: Sun 23 Oct 2022

Flu cases are higher than usual for this time of year and are expected to soar in the coming weeks. A 3rd virus, RSV [respiratory syncytial virus], is straining pediatric hospitals in some states.

For more than 2 years, shuttered schools and offices, social distancing, and masks granted Americans a reprieve from flu and most other respiratory infections. This winter [2022-23] is likely to be different.

With few to no restrictions in place and travel and socializing back in full swing, an expected winter rise in COVID cases appears poised to collide with a resurgent influenza season, causing a "twindemic" -- or even a "tripledemic," with a 3rd pathogen, respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, in the mix.

Cases of flu have begun to tick up earlier than usual, and are expected to soar over the coming weeks. Children infected with RSV (which has similar symptoms to flu and COVID), rhinoviruses, and enteroviruses are already straining pediatric hospitals in several states.

"We're seeing everything come back with a vengeance," said Dr Alpana Waghmare, an infectious diseases expert at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and a physician at Seattle Children's Hospital.

Most cases of COVID, flu, and RSV are likely to be mild, but together they may sicken millions of Americans and swamp hospitals, public health experts warned.

"You've got this waning COVID immunity, coinciding with the impact of the flu coming along here, and RSV," said Andrew Read, an evolutionary microbiologist at Penn State University. "We're in uncharted territory here."

The vaccines for COVID and flu, while they may not prevent infection, still offer the best protection against severe illness and death, experts said. They urged everyone, and especially those at high risk, to get their shots as soon as possible.

Older adults, immunocompromised people, and pregnant women are most at risk, and young children are highly susceptible to influenza and RSV. Many infected children are becoming severely ill because they have little immunity, either because it has waned or because they were not exposed to these viruses before the pandemic.

RSV causes about 14 000 deaths among adults 65 and older and up to 300 deaths among children under 5 each year. No vaccine is available, but at least 2 candidates are in late-stage clinical trials and appear to be highly effective in older adults. Pfizer is also developing an antiviral drug.

"As of today, we are seeing equal numbers of COVID, flu, and RSV and that's really concerning because we are very early for flu and RSV activity," said Dr Diego Hijano, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital.
"It's going to be a rough winter," he said.
