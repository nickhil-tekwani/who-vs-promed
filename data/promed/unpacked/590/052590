D-2004-0806-01N, 2004. Accepted for publication 30 Jul 2004.
"Tissue-printing" hybridization (3) for Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd)
and Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) was used to assess the sanitary status of stone
fruit accessions in the Canadian Clonal Genebank (CCG) located in Harrow
(Ontario). The _Prunus_ spp. accessions in the CCG are primarily of
Canadian origin; other countries of origin include the United States, the
United Kingdom, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Former Soviet Union,
Spain, New Zealand, and Italy. All _Prunus_ spp. accessions were donated to
the Genebank from Canadian or American sources.
Leaves were harvested in November 2003 from 336 trees (116 peach and
nectarine, 84 sweet and sour cherries, 54 plum, 44 apricot, and 38 of other
cherries) representing 267 accessions. No visible symptoms were observed
during the collection of the accessions to be evaluated. The petioles were
excised at the base and imprinted on a nylon membrane in triplicate for
each sample. The membranes were air-dried and submitted by mail to the
laboratory. The digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes used for hybridization were
obtained by T7 RNA polymerase transcription of the linearized plasmids
pHSVd (1) and pPLMVd (2).
30 stone fruit samples were infected by viroids. PLMVd occurred in 28 peach
and nectarine samples, representing the following cultivars and selections:
Harblaze Hardired, Harko, Earlyvee, Harbelle, Harken, Harland, Harrow
Beauty, Harrow Rubirose, HW264, Redhaven, Silver Gold, Suncling, V68101,
Vanity, Veeglo, Velvet, Vesper, Villa Doria, and Vulcan.
PLMVd-infected samples represented 24.1 percent of the tested peaches and
nectarines. PLMVd finding confirms previous reports of the viroid in Canada
from British Columbia and Ontario. 2 CCG apricot accessions, 'Bulida' and
'Velkopavlovicka', were found to be infected with only HSVd, representing
4.5 percent of tested apricot samples. These samples, determined to be
positive by tissue-printing hybridization, were also positive by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (1). In addition,
nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were obtained. The 'Bulida'
isolate showed 100 percent homology to a Spanish isolate, apr9, while the
'Velkopavlovicka' isolate showed 99 percent homology to an Italian isolate.
Since HSVd has not been previously reported in Canada (4), to our
knowledge, this report documents its 1st detection in the country. This
report may prompt the inclusion of regular testing for HSVd in existing
_Prunus_ spp. virus testing programs in Canada.

[HSVd is a member of the family _Pospiviroidae_. Isolates of HSVd have been
classified into 5 groups; 3 major types: plum, hop and citrus, and 2 minor
ones presumably derived from recombination between members of the main
groups. HSVd apparently has a wide host range, infecting cucumber,
grapevine, citrus, plum, peach, pear, apricot and almond. There appears to
be consensus among viroid specialists, based on molecular genetic studies,
that the viroid moved from grapevine to hop. HSVd is very contagious and is
found worldwide. In the Czech Republic, HSVd incidence in grapevine planted
in the vicinity of hop gardens was found to be about 70 percent. Previous
work has characterized HSVd isolates from France, Italy, Japan, Spain and
USA. Current studies have revealed 16 new sequence variants from Cyprus,
Greece, Morocco, and Turkey, where HSVd had not been described previously.
The origin and route of the intrusion of HSVd into Canada remain unknown.
