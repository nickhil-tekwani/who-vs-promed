In the last two weeks, over 15 horses in a small town not far from
Phoenix, Arizona, have died from mysterious causes. On Saturday (23 Jan
1999), one of a close associate's horses had to be put down as well. At
the request of local authorities, one of the sick animals was taken to
the University of Arizona at Tempe, where researchers took a series of
samples before ultimately euthanizing her [a mare. The researchers have
found nothing.
The clinical signs are a significant loss of muscular coordination
and/or motor skills. Perception and reasoning abilities of the animal
appear intact. Hunger and thirst are normal as well. However, the animal
is unable to stand. In this case, the horse responded by thrashing about
constantly. This resulted in severe lesions on the knees (which in some
cases went to the bone.) The wounds were kept bandaged over the six-day
period before this mare was ultimately put down. In the last three
nights, the horse had to be manually rolled over every couple of hours
to avoid lung injuries as it was unable to roll over [unaided.
Local authorities have been notified and are baffled. Recently, a
Federal Veterinarian was in the area to assess the situation, but has
made no progress. There are a number of reasons for concern. One of the
horse owner's is pregnant. Though the local veterinarian assures her
that 'it is not transmissible to humans'', one must wonder how this
assessment can be made - especially since no one can say what ''it''
is. Also, this same family has 5 other horses that are obviously at
risk. [Certainly the risk may extend further than one herd or stable -
Mod.TG Also scary is the fact that some locals have shot their own
animals and ''dumped them over cliffs'' [The implication, although
unstated, is the 'dumped' animals are diseased - Mod.TG Several
theories have been advanced, including botulism or Rhinovirus. Tests
have shown neither.

[There are a multitude of possible causes for such symptoms, including
toxic plants that the horses may have consumed either in pasture or in
hay. If would be nice if our Arizona readers could give us more
information or a definitive diagnosis - Mod.TG
