Hundreds of residents from 18 villages and subdistricts in the
Southeast District Padang Sidempuan [North Sumatra] have been
attacked by suspected chikungunya disease.

Analysis of information gathered Wednesday (7 Oct 2009), showed the
disease was spreading weekly in densely populated areas, and every
day there were people who were attacked [by the virus].

According to one local resident, almost the whole community in the
area already has been affected by the chikungunya outbreak. The
initial symptoms include fever experienced by residents, headache
accompanied by high fever, chills and they did not want to eat. One
day post-infection [post onset of symptoms], the patient's skin
develops visible spots that are very itchy. Every citizen who
develops the disease could not move or walk and was lame. The
[people] suspected of having chikungunya disease included adults and children.

Admittedly, until now residents who are affected by chikungunya just
check into one of the doctors who practice in the region. "Every day
the doctor's office was filled with patients who sought treatment for
a disease having characteristics similar to chikungunya [virus
infection]," a resident of the area said.

[ProMED-mail thanks Ronen Skaletzky for sending in this report. A
chikungunya outbreak was reported on 13 Apr 2009 in South Sumatra
(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20090418.1477). Now there may be an
outbreak in North Sumatra.

Outbreaks were frequent in 2008 in Indonesia, including Sumatra (see
archives below). ProMED-mail is interested in receiving further
reports on this outbreak of suspected chikungunya virus infection in
North Sumatra, especially results of laboratory tests confirming (or
discarding) chikungunya virus as the etiological agent involved, as
well as further indications of the extent and spread of the outbreak.

Padang Sidempuan is in the regency of South Tapanuli, North Sumatra.
