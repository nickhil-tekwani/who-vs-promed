Streptococcus iniae is a pathogen in fish capable of causing invasive
disease in fish, and there are epidemics among fish grown by aquaculture,
such as the Hawaiian sunfish, which is a popular food fish in Asian
communities.
Mitchell R. Weinstein et al (University of Toronto, CA) report that S.
iniae can produce invasive infection (cellulitis of the hand and
endocarditis) in
humans with skin injuries who handle fresh fish. QY: D. E. Low, Dept. Micro-
biology, Mount Sinai Hospital, 600 University Ave., Toronto ON M5G 1X5, CA

A year ago, MMWR carried a report of four cases of S. iniae infection
in four Chinese residents of Ontario during 1995-1996. Here's a
summary of the MMWR report:
During December 1995-February 1996, four cases of a bacteremic illness
(three accompanied by cellulitis and the fourth with infective
endocarditis, meningitis, and probable septic arthritis) were identified
among patients at a hospital in Ontario. Streptococcus iniae, a fish
pathogen not previously reported as a cause of illness in humans, was
isolated from all four patients. All four patients were
of Chinese descent had a history of preparing fresh, whole fish; three
patients for whom information was available had an injury associated with
preparation of fresh, whole fish purchased locally.
