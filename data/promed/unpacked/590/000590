Trial: 7 days of doxycycline preferable to [single-dose] azithromycin for rectal _Chlamydia_.
-----------------------------
The results of a randomized clinical trial conducted in Australia indicate a 7-day course of doxycycline is superior to single-dose azithromycin for treating rectal chlamydia in men who have sex with men, researchers reported yesterday [24 Jun 2021] in the New England Journal of Medicine [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2031631].

The double-blind, randomized trial was conducted at 5 sexual health clinics in Australia from August 2016 through August 2019 to determine which of the 2 regimens, which are both recommended for treatment of rectal _Chlamydia_, is more efficacious.

While single-dose azithromycin has been an attractive therapy because of its simplicity, recent observational data has indicated that 7 days of doxycycline may be up to 20% more effective. But no randomized trials to date have been conducted. Enrollment in the trial was limited to asymptomatic _Chlamydia_ [infection] because more than 85% of rectal _Chlamydia_ infections among men who have sex with men are asymptomatic.

A total of 625 men were enrolled in the trial, and primary outcome data were available for 290 in the doxycycline group and 297 in the azithromycin group. In the modified intention-to-treat population, microbiologic cure occurred in 96.9% of men in the doxycycline group and 76.4% of men in the azithromycin group, for an adjusted risk difference of 19.9 percentage points. In the per-protocol population, microbiologic cure was observed in 95.7% of men in the doxycycline group and 73.3% in the azithromycin group, for an adjusted risk difference of 21.3 percentage points. Adverse events, including nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were reported in 33.8% of men in the doxycycline group and 45.1% in the azithromycin group.

The study authors say azithromycin will still have a place for the treatment of _Chlamydia_ during pregnancy, when doxycycline is not recommended, and in patients who are allergic to doxycycline.

"Abstract
----------
Background. Rectal chlamydia is a common bacterial sexually transmissible infection among men who have sex with men. Data from randomized, controlled trials are needed to guide treatment.

"Methods. In this double-blind trial conducted at 5 sexual health clinics in Australia, we randomly assigned men who have sex with men and who had asymptomatic rectal chlamydia to receive doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for 7 days) or azithromycin (1-g single dose). Asymptomatic chlamydia was selected as the trial focus because more than 85% of men with rectal chlamydia infection are asymptomatic, and clinical guidelines recommend a longer treatment course for symptomatic infection. The primary outcome was a negative nucleic acid amplification test for rectal chlamydia (microbiologic cure) at 4 weeks.

"Results. From August 2016 through August 2019, we enrolled 625 men (314 in the doxycycline group and 311 in the azithromycin group). Primary outcome data were available for 290 men (92.4%) in the doxycycline group and 297 (95.5%) in the azithromycin group. In the modified intention-to-treat population, a microbiologic cure occurred in 281 of 290 men (96.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 94.9 to 98.9) in the doxycycline group and in 227 of 297 (76.4%; 95% CI, 73.8 to 79.1) in the azithromycin group, for an adjusted risk difference of 19.9 percentage points (95% CI, 14.6 to 25.3; P less than 0.001). Adverse events that included nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting were reported in 98 men (33.8%) in the doxycycline group and in 134 (45.1%) in the azithromycin group (risk difference, -11.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -19.5 to -3.2).

"Conclusions. A 7-day course of doxycycline was superior to single-dose azithromycin in the treatment of rectal chlamydia infection among men who have sex with men."

The U.S. CDC treatment recommendations for urogenital _Chlamydia_ infection (https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/chlamydia.htm) are:
Azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice a day for 7 days. Alternative regimens are erythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times a day for 7 days; erythromycin ethylsuccinate 800 mg orally 4 times a day for 7 days; levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days; or ofloxacin 300 mg orally twice a day for 7 days.

The CDC cites retrospective studies that raised concern about the efficacy of azithromycin for rectal _C. trachomatis_ infection, but said prospective clinical trials comparing azithromycin versus doxycycline regimens for rectal _C. trachomatis_ infection are needed. This has been accomplished by the above study from Australia. - Mod.ML
