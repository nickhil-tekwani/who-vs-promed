Glanders, the equine disease which has devastated the kingdom's
equestrian community and looked close to being eradicated from the
kingdom's shores, has reared its ugly head again.

Two horses from the Dilmun Stables in Saar have tested positive to the
bacterial infection; the results are awaited on the condition of a 3rd
pony following an inconclusive finding.

The movement ban on horses across the island has been extended for
another 4 months, and the endurance horse riding competition planned
as part of the GCC Games' 11 disciplines was swiftly withdrawn from
the Bahrain 11 programme of events, which have been reduced to 10.

Whilst there are conflicting reports over the numbers of horses and
ponies destroyed after testing positive to glanders, officials state
"more than 70" horses have had to be put down since the outbreak in
early 2010.

Over the summer, it appeared that the battle against glanders was
being won, after 3 rounds of testing involving every horse and pony on
the island came through as "negative" ... until just a few weeks ago.

Experts say that testing in the immediate area will have to continue,
and the chances are that Bahrain will not be officially declared
"glanders free" for at least another 14 months because international
authorities demand a 6-month period of grace after all retests have
returned negative ... provided no new cases are discovered in the
meantime.

The disease, caused by the highly-infectious bacterium _Burkholderia
mallei_, occurs primarily in horses and can stay dormant from 3 weeks
to 8 months, or in rare cases even longer.

Strict measures were introduced across Bahrain following the 1st
outbreak, and popular show jumping events were cancelled. At the time,
the Dilmun Stables introduced some of the most stringent measures in
the kingdom in an attempt to keep the facilities free of the disease.

However, the stable team's best efforts were in vain after 2 horses
tested positive last month [September 2011] and were subsequently put
down.

The blood samples were sent to the Central Veterinary Research
Laboratory (CVRL) in Dubai, one of the only 2 authorised laboratories
in the world certified by the Office International des Epizooties, or
World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), in Paris for testing
glanders.

Dr Ulrich Wernery, scientific director of CVRL, said: "In Bahrain, we
have tested 4000 horses and donkeys twice. The 3rd round of testing
was coming to an end when sadly the 2 horses tested positive. All
positive cases, numbering more than 70, have been destroyed. The good
news is that we are close to reaching the end of the problem. The
outbreak has entered the last stage, in my opinion. There were no
cases in donkeys. There were very few cases in camels ... very
negligible, but they are all clear now. Part of the island is free.
Only this particular area and those surrounding it will need to be
re-tested."

Dr Wernery praised the Bahraini authorities' efforts in tackling the
problem, which started when a horse imported from Kuwait was found to
be carrying the disease [According to Kuwait's OIE report of 10 May
2010, the 1st 2 horses which were positive without clinical signs to
glanders originated from Syria and Kuwait and arrived 6 months
earlier. After testing, the other horses in the same stable became
positive with clinical signs. See archived 20100510.1527. - Mod.AS].
Since then, all horses in the kingdom have been implanted with
micro-chips containing all relevant information.

Dr Wernery said the only way forward is to continue testing and
re-testing horses in the affected stable and areas surrounding it. He
said: "It is a complicated disease, and the bacterium takes time to
incubate and can remain dormant in an animal for up to 8 months. After
the last round and once all horses are tested negative, an expert from
the European Union will check all the papers, and only then will the
country be declared glanders free."

Dr Wernery reiterated that the disease is so contagious it can be
passed simply on the soles of shoes, and all stables should continue
following strict rules of not sharing troughs and not moving horses
between stables until the horses have tested negative twice. He also
said that adults and children are not in danger as long as they do not
come in contact with any nasal discharge or the pus of an infected
animal.

Alec Peck, a member of the Dilmun Club's executive committee,
confirmed that 2 of its stabled horses were put down after testing
positive for glanders. He said: "All the other horses have been
further tested. The test on one horse is inconclusive, and we are
awaiting results of a further test. We are following all the rules and
guidelines laid down by the authorities exactly as we have done in the
past."

Meanwhile, the latest outbreak has raised a hornet's nest on the
social networking site Facebook page "Stop Glanders in Bahrain," which
is being used by the horse and stable owners in the kingdom to share
information about the disease. Tempers have been running high with
many members seeking more information from the stable and others
raising concerns about horses from other stables being ridden around
the island despite the risks.

[The above 2 cases were officially reported to the OIE in a
notification submitted by Bahrain on 1 Oct 2011; see, with an
interactive map and epidemiological comments, at

commentary in archived post 20110430.1350.

The need for improved international standardisation of glanders
diagnostic biologicals has recently become subject for discussion; see
