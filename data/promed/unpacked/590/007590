"Enterovirus season is near; parents, nurseries, and kindergartens
should be vigilant"
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed 2 more cases of
enterovirus infections with severe complications today (Tue 10 Mar
2009]; these were children aged 2.5 years and 3 years. Both children
were infected with enterovirus 71. These children lived in Southern
Taiwan, and attended the same nursery in the same class. The nursery
with infected children has been closed for a total of 10 days, since
6 Mar 2009. Health officials had asked contacts to watch for similar
symptoms. The CDC is asking families with infants and young children,
daycare centres, and kindergartens to practice good hygiene and wash
hands frequently in order to decrease the likelihood of enterovirus
infection. Also, if children have symptoms suspicious of severe
infections, they should be transferred to hospitals immediately.

[According to the World Health Organisation, enteroviruses infecting
humans are found worldwide and humans are the only known natural
hosts. Many enteroviruses are associated with specific syndromes: for
example, those within the _Human enterovirus A_ species (such as the
A-type human coxsackieviruses and human enterovirus 71) more commonly
cause hand-foot-mouth disease (rash especially on the palms and soles
with vesicular eruption and inflammation of the mouth). Young
children are most susceptible to infection. In less developed areas,
children may become infected during early infancy while in more
socio-economically advanced areas, 1st infection may not occur until
adolescence. Males more often develop clinically recognizable
diseases than females. Transmission is usually by the faeco-oral or
by the respiratory route when there is an associated respiratory
illness. The virus may be excreted in the stool for many weeks.

Enteroviruses have been detected in water, soil, vegetables, and
shellfish, and may possibly be transmitted in the community by
contact with contaminated food or water. The epidemiological pattern
varies by geographical region and climate, but the incidence of
infection is higher in the summer and autumn months in temperate
climates while remaining prevalent year-round in tropical climates.

Severe outbreaks of hand-foot-mouth disease associated with
enterovirus 71 infection have previously been reported from Taiwan in
1998, and Malaysia in 1997. Consequently, the diagnosis of severe
cases of enterovirus 71 infection early in the year is a matter for
concern in Taiwan.
