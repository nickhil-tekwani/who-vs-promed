Temporary Deferral Recommended for Heart Patients Volunteering for Smallpox
Vaccination
-----------------------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today took the precautionary
step of adding a temporary medical deferral to the smallpox vaccination
program for persons who have been diagnosed with heart disease. CDC is
investigating whether there is any association between smallpox vaccination
and reports of heart problems in 7 health care workers who have been
vaccinated.
CDC added the temporary measure to the existing list of deferral criteria
based on information from its real-time monitoring system, which showed a
small number of heart-related incidents among health care workers following
smallpox vaccination. It is not clear whether this number is greater than
would be expected normally in this population, CDC scientists said.
"We promised to monitor this program closely and to put safety first, so we
are exercising exceptional caution," said Julie Gerberding, M.D., CDC
director. "If our investigation shows this precautionary measure should
become permanent or the need for other changes or enhancements in the
civilian smallpox vaccination program, we will take immediate action. We
continue to believe that it is important and necessary to vaccinate health
care workers to prepare our nation in the event we have to respond to a
smallpox outbreak," Dr. Gerberding said.
CDC is recommending that persons with known cardiac disease -- such as
cardiomyopathy, previous heart attack, history of angina, or other evidence
of coronary artery disease -- be temporarily deferred from receiving
smallpox vaccination. CDC will provide states simple questions about heart
problems to use in screening people volunteering for smallpox vaccination.
In pursuing its promise of safety, last week CDC asked the Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) Smallpox Vaccine Safety Review
Board to examine reports of heart-related adverse events occurring in
connection with the smallpox vaccination program. CDC is also beginning
research projects aimed at identifying and understanding any associations
that may exist between smallpox vaccine and heart-related problems.
"A major part of our monitoring program involves regularly sharing
information about adverse events with experts such as those on the ACIP.
They can help assess whether the smallpox vaccine is, indeed, associated
with the medical conditions described in the adverse event reports," said
Walter Orenstein, M.D., director of CDC's National Immunization Program.
CDC has received several reports of heart-related problems among the 25 645
people who have been vaccinated in the civilian program. The 7 cases
prompting today's precautionary action include 3 cases of myocardial
infarction (heart attack), one of which resulted in death; 2 cases of
angina (chest pain); and 2 cases of myopericarditis (inflammation of the
heart muscle or sac surrounding the heart). In each case the individual's
medical history, including risk factors for heart disease, is being studied.
Cases of heart inflammation following smallpox vaccination were reported in
the 1960s and 1970s. However, these reports do not provide any information
about the types of people who may be at higher risk for heart-related
problems following smallpox vaccination.

[A PubMed search on reports of myocardial events following smallpox
vaccination revealed case reports of such events from Italy, Norway,
Russia, Greece, France, Sweden, Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, UK, Former
Yugoslavia, and Hungary (a selection of these reports are referenced below
for those who may be interested). The report by Karjalainen J et. al
(ref.19 ) mentions that "the incidence of vaccinia myocarditis was 1/10 000
smallpox vaccinations." (from abstract). The majority of these case
reports refer to myocarditis. Given the case reports in the literature
from earlier vaccination efforts and the identification of 7
cardiac-related events in the USA following smallpox vaccination, the above
recommendation seems prudent until this can be studied further. Of note,
the case report in ref 1 below occurred in a 6-year-old child, so that
pre-existing myocardial disease may not be the only predisposing factor.
