Bong County Health Officer Dr. Samson Azoakoi told journalists that 12 Lassa fever cases have been reported from Phebe Hospital in Bong County in Central Liberia over the past 2 months. Of these, there have been 8 fatalities based on clinical diagnosis. Tissue specimens have been sent out of the country for confirmation. The Lassa fever belt in Liberia occurs predominantly in Lofa, Bong and Nimba Counties across the northern tier of counties bordering Guinea.

Eight persons have reportedly died in Bong County and 4 are said to be hospitalized following an outbreak of Lassa fever months ago, Sampson Arzuakoi, head of the county health team, told journalists in Gbarnga on Tuesday [10 Sep 2013]. Dr. Arzuakoi said 6 of the victims died at hospitals in Bong, and the rest, who contracted the disease in Gbarnga, died at the Jackson Fiah Doe hospital in Tappita, Nimba County after travelling for treatment. He said the Ministry has already taken measures to stop the spread of the epidemic and would embark on sensitization campaigns and immunisation[?] in the county.

Explaining more on the dreaded fever and its dangers to humans, Arzuakoi said the disease was transmitted by a specific rat which had no hair on its tail. Arzuakoi said the symptoms of Lassa fever include severe headache, high fever and vomiting [and bleeding?] that passes through all the openings in the human body. He advised persons with such symptoms to rush to the nearest hospital for medical attention. "The epidemic is in Bong," Arzuakoi warns citizens.

Lassa fever has over the years risen to be a quiet killer with victims ignorant of its presence, according to him. Cases of infection, he said, have been reported in Gbarnga, Suakoko and other parts of Bong. "This Lassa fever thing has been reported in other areas in the county for a while now," he said. He said the rat, which lives in and around many homes in Africa, has been identified as the carrier of the virus.

When the Ministry of Health deployed medical experts some weeks ago to Bong, many would have assumed it was for some common epidemic that was ravaging the county's 13 administrative districts. Such supposition would be wrong because the speedy deployment of these health experts was to control the outbreak of Lassa fever. Unfortunate as it may sound; Lassa fever has claimed some lives, not only in Bong, but in other parts of Liberia.

[Lassa fever is an acute viral illness that occurs in West Africa. The cause of the illness was found to be Lassa virus, named after the town in Nigeria where the 1st cases originated. The virus, a member of the virus family _Arenaviridae_, is a single-stranded RNA virus and is zoonotic, or animal-borne. Lassa fever is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever is mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 percent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 percent have a severe multisystem disease. Lassa fever is an endemic disease in portions of West Africa. It is recognized in Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, as well as Nigeria. However, because the rodent species which carry the virus are found throughout West Africa, the actual geographic range of the disease may extend to other countries in the region. Individuals at risk are those who live or visit areas with a high population of _Mastomys_ rodents infected with Lassa virus or are exposed to infected humans.

Primary transmission of the Lassa virus to humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with _Mastomys_ rodents, especially in the geographic regions where outbreaks occur. Storing food away in rodent-proof containers and keeping living areas clean help to discourage rodents from entering homes. When caring for patients with Lassa fever, further transmission of the disease through person-to-person contact or nosocomial routes can be avoided by taking preventive precautions against contact with patient secretions (together called VHF [Viral Haemorrhagic Fever] isolation precautions or barrier nursing methods) [http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/vhfmanual.htm]. Such precautions include wearing protective clothing, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and goggles; using infection control measures, such as complete equipment sterilization; and isolating infected patients from contact with unprotected persons until the disease has run its course. The disease can be treated.

Signs and symptoms of Lassa fever typically occur 1-3 weeks after the patient comes into contact with the virus. These include fever, retrosternal pain (pain behind the chest wall), sore throat, back pain, cough, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, facial swelling, proteinuria (protein in the urine), and mucosal bleeding. Neurological problems have also been described, including hearing loss, tremors, and encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Lassa fever are so varied and nonspecific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult. The anti-viral drug ribavirin can be used in treatment of severe cases. Currently, there is no protective vaccine.
