[Castilla - La Mancha is a large province to the east & south of Madrid: see https://www.google.com/maps/place/Castile-La+Mancha,+Spain/@39.6534532,-5.4042475,7z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0xd665fc0adf9a72b:0x3be1ba931772b6d2!8m2!3d39.2795607!4d-3.097702.

Livestock anthrax is sporadic in Spain. This is clearly an unusual event. In the past, prior to their national control & surveillance program, Central Spain had enzootic anthrax and reported a significant number of human cases each year. One might suspect that this pasture, presently contaminated, had had a number of anthrax cattle graves. Past flooding may have floated the spores to the upper soil surface. And the grazing cattle -- cows graze by pulling the forage out of the soil -- acquired infective doses of spores. This was an expensive experience for the farm owners. - Mod.MHJ
