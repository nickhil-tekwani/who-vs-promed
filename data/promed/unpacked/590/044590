After a health scare this week [30 Jul-5 Ago 2018] with bighorn sheep in Zion National Park [south west Utah], scientists are monitoring the health of our local [Nevada] herd. The population was hit hard by pneumonia just a few years ago.

Waiting for bighorn sheep to make their way into Hemenway Park in Boulder City [Nevada] takes patience, but during the summer they rarely disappoint. Visitors were joined by Doug Nielsen with the Nevada Department of Wildlife, monitoring the heard from a safe distance. "Here they come. This is kind of like putting Dairy Queen in the middle of a college campus. It does not take them long to figure out where it is at," said Nielsen.

Just this week, pneumonia was reported in sheep in nearby Zion National Park. Hikers are being asked to report any sheep seen coughing.

Nielsen says the population is still recovering after the same disease spread through Nevada sheep just a few years ago. "There's no natural antibodies for it. They do not have a natural protection and there's nothing we can do for them. And if it goes into full-blown pneumonia it can, and in this case, has had an impact on the herd," said Nielsen. A few generations were wiped out. So the sight of a lamb today is a good sign.

Surrounded by Lake Mead and development, the mountain range near the park is now somewhat of an island, with the sheep cut off from migrating a great distance. However, across the state, the bighorn is doing much better than 50 years ago. And one reason is man's intervention -- conservation efforts and roundups like the one from 2007, taking sheep from a range in Clark county [Nevada] to repopulate other areas up north. Today, as many as 12 000 bighorn sheep roam the Nevada Range. During the 1960s, that number was less than 3000.

"They're an economic boon; tourists stop here. People travel all the way across the country because they've heard of Hemenway Park. For Boulder City, it's an important part of the community really," said Nielsen. And visitors would agree, saying "There are some matriarch types too with the big horns." All it takes is patience and remembering to keep your distance from the sheep in the park.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena like this usually requires integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

Bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggests that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant. However, recent evidence indicates that in the north western USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.
