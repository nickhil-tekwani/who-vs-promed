Sick dolphin found in Alabama may offer clues to massive die-off
----------------------------------------------------------------
A sick dolphin found Friday [25 Nov 2011] in a marsh near Fort Morgan
[Alabama] -- named Chance by its rescuers -- may be headed to
recovery, according to Moby Solangi, director of the Institute for
Marine Mammal Studies in Gulfport [Mississippi].

The live 2-year-old dolphin was among 5 found stranded within a week,
Solangi said Monday [28 Nov 2011]. 4 of the dolphins -- 2 in Alabama
and 2 in Mississippi -- were dead.

Solangi said some of the samples taken from the live dolphin were sent
to local hospitals for testing. Other samples are going to
laboratories across the nation today [29 Nov 2011], he said.

The dolphin is about 6 feet [1.8 meters] long and weighs about 220
pounds [100 kilograms], he said. Solangi estimated the dolphin had
lost about 20 percent of its body weight and said it was suffering
from parasites, scrapes and bruises.

He and others hope that the dolphin can be a piece of the puzzle about
why dolphins have been dying in unusual numbers in the northern Gulf
of Mexico.

Solangi said, "We'll find more answers than we've been able to get in
looking at dead animals."

Deaths of about 600 dolphins since February 2010 have been described
by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] officials as
an "unusual mortality event." The event is occurring from the
Texas/Louisiana border to the Florida Panhandle.

The deaths have become a focus of attention because of public concern
that they may be linked to the 2010 Gulf oil spill and its aftermath.

Said Erin Fougeres, administrator of NOAA's Southeast Region Stranding
Program: "No individual animal is going to be the smoking gun that
tells us the cause of all the mortalities that occurred, but it is
always interesting to have an animal that is in such good condition."

No connection between the dolphin deaths and the oil spill has been
established, she said. "We continue to look at all possible causes for
the mortality event and the oil spill itself is a potential cause that
we are looking at," Fougeres said. "It may have impacted the animals
by compromising their immune system to make them more susceptible, but
we can't say that is what occurred at this point."

Fougeres said the investigation into the dolphin deaths has been
widespread. "We may end up with multiple factors as the cause," she
said.

Solangi said that 2 dolphins found dead Sunday at Gulfport and Pass
Christian [Mississippi] were each about 5 feet long [1.5 meters].
"This is probably the crop that was born in February and March this
year [2011]," he said.

An October [2011] report released by NOAA stated that 5 of 21 dolphin
carcasses tested positive and were believed to have died from a
bacterium called _Brucella_, which causes flu-like symptoms in marine
mammals. All the carcasses that tested positive for _Brucella_ were
found along the Louisiana coast. They included 2 adults and 3
fetuses.

The bacterium is associated with abortions in marine and other
mammals. The number of carcasses testing positive or suspected
positive for _Brucella_ has expanded to 10 out of 29, Fougeres said.

In a typical year, about 30 dead dolphins are found along Mississippi
and Alabama beaches, Solangi said. There have been more than 100 over
the course of the past year, he said. "Of course, people are more on
the lookout for them (since the spill), but there is obviously
something going on," he said. This past February and March [2011], for
example, saw a historic number of dead dolphin fetuses and babies, he
said.

Solangi said that the dolphin found Friday [25 Nov 2011] will stay at
the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies for recovery and
rehabilitation, which could last several months.

[Hopefully studies carried out on this sick animal will shed some
light on the causes behind these unusual dolphin mortalities. If the
problem is due to a common proximal cause (such as, a single etiologic
agent that directly causes disease), the chances of establishing the
origin are larger than if the problem is multifactorial. It is
unlikely that _Brucella_ might be a sufficient cause of these
die-offs, as this pathogen, although widespread in marine mammals,
only seldom has been found associated with diseases such as
placentitis/abortions, neonatal mortality, meningoencephalitis,
abscesses, or other syndromes. To establish a more distant
cause-effect relationship, such as the oil spill, might prove very
challenging. - Mod.PMB]
