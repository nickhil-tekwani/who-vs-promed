12 000 Cattle Vaccinated Against Foot and Mouth in Northern Province
------------------------------------------
Northern Province veterinarians have vaccinated 12 000 cattle against foot
and mouth disease (FMD) in the past 2 days since the disease broke out in
the Bushbuckridge area on Thursady 1 Feb 2001. Dr Peter Loock of the
provincial veterinary services department said the whole of the
Bushbuckridge area had been quarantined, and strict control measures in the
form of roadblocks had been put in place.
The disease was first detected at Orinoco farm, and laboratory tests have
indicated the disease might have been transmitted by buffalo that escaped
from the Kruger National Park. "Laboratory tests have confirmed the strain
detected in the cattle was the same as that found in buffaloes in the
park," Loock said. He said strict measures had been taken to ensure the
disease did not spread to the neighboring farms in Mpumalanga. Mpumalanga's
department of veterinary services has meanwhile decided to begin
vaccinating cattle in the Nsikazi district next week because of the
Bushbuckridge outbreak. Departmental deputy director Dr Ben du Plessis said
[that control measures in the Onderberg area were still in place, and more
than 90 per cent of cattle had been vaccinated since 19 Dec 2000.
In Mpumalanga the disease first broke out at a feedlot in Kanhym Estate
near Middelburg in December 2000 where 10 000 cattle were infected. It
broke out in the Onderberg region shortly afterwards, after diseased cattle
from Kanhym were detected in an abattoir in neighboring Swaziland. Du
Plessis said that Kanhym Estate would remain under quarantine until all the
cattle had been slaughtered. He said quarantine on neighboring farms had
been lifted.
