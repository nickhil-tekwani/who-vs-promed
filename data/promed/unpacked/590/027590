Farmers worried as disease wreaks havoc on rice
-----------------------------------------------
Massive pest (stem borer) attack and stem rot disease are wreaking havoc on the transplanted aman [wet season lowland rice] in Taraganj, Rangpur division. Frustration has gripped the farmers. At least 20 to 25 percent of the plants have been badly affected.

The farmers said that plants at different villages are drying up. "If the situation continues, we will suffer huge losses." They failed to prevent spread of stem disease and pest attack despite spraying insecticides. According to the district agriculture officials, aman has been cultivated on 9800 hectares [24 216 acres] in Taraganj.

[Stem rot is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe salvinii_ (previously _Sclerotium oryzae_). It occurs in circular to irregular areas in fields and causes premature death and lodging (collapse) of plants. Stalks develop black lesions, weaken at the water line, and then break, making harvest difficult. The presence of black sclerotia (fungal survival structures) is characteristic for the disease. Plants infected early yield poorly, and a high percentage of plants is killed. Wounds (for example due to mechanical damage during transplanting as for the crops mentioned above) may act as entry points for the fungus.

The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), and water (floating sclerotia). The pathogen survives between crops as sclerotia on straw or in soil. Disease management may include cultural and phytosanitary measures, including crop rotation, fluctuating water levels, and removal of pathogen reservoirs (such as burning the rice stubble). Some fungicides may reduce disease incidence if sprayed early enough. However, use of resistant cultivars is considered the best means of stem rot control.

Rice stem borers are serious pests and can infest the crop at all stages. They include a number of species of moths (order Lepidoptera).
