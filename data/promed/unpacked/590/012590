WHO: Ebola Response Roadmap Update 26 Sep 2014 [data as of 23 Sep 2014]
---------------------------------------------------
Following the roadmap structure, country reports fall into 2 categories: those with widespread and intense transmission (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone); and those with an initial case or cases, or with localized transmission (Nigeria, Senegal).

An overview of the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where a separate, unrelated outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) is occurring, is also provided (see Annex 1).

In addition to the midweek Ebola Response Roadmap situation report, Ebola Response Roadmap updates will now be issued on Friday evening, and will replace the updates usually issued on Monday evening until further notice.

1. Countries with widespread and intense transmission
6553 (probable, confirmed and suspected; see Annex 2) cases and 3083 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak of EVD as at 23 September 2014 by the Ministries of Health of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (table 1)
