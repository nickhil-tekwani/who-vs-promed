Ten years ago, Utah [unlike many other states was, in fishing annals,
disease-free. A few months later a [minute parasite [_Myxobolus
cerebralis_ mysteriously appeared in a private hatchery in Loa. Now, a few
months shy of the 10th anniversary of the discovery of whirling disease in
Utah, the bug continues to spread throughout the state.
After a decade of dealing with the parasite, Chris Wilson, director of the
Utah Division of Wildlife Resource's (DWR) Logan experiment station, said
he has discovered a number of things about the parasite. "For one, we've
been very impressed by the parasite's durability. It survives anywhere and
can be carried any number of ways -- by humans, birds, animals, in the
water itself," he said. "Even now, after 10 years, we're still as concerned
as ever about infecting new waters."
Last year, the DWR's worst fears came true. The parasite got into the
rearing ponds in the state-owned Midway hatchery. As a result, millions of
fish had to be destroyed. Worse, most of those fish were headed for
transplanting. An extensive program involving the DWR, BYU (Brigham Young
University), and a private company looked at the security of the water
flowing into the hatchery. The program isolated 3 springs feeding the
hatchery, and sentinel fish were placed there for testing. Fish in 2 of the
springs tested positive for whirling disease. It appears water from the
Provo River, which is infected with the disease and is flowing into
irrigation canals throughout the area, is now seeping through the porous
ground and contaminating the springs.
"What we're trying to do now is drill deeper wells to try and find water
the spores can't reach," Joe Valentine, aquatic supervisor for the DWR,
said. "One test well, which is down about 200 feet, looks very promising."
The DWR will need more wells, however, before operations at the hatchery
can be resumed. In the meantime, it will cost millions of dollars to
disease-proof the Midway hatchery. Raceways, for example, will need to be
built above ground to stop contaminated groundwater from seeping in. Also,
a cover will need to be built over the ponds to protect them from aerial
invasions. Biologists believe the Midway hatchery was contaminated by a
bird that ate a diseased fish and excreted the bug into one of the ponds.
To protect the Kamas hatchery from such an assault, a roof costing $1
million had to be built.
Within the past decade, the disease has contaminated a number of Utah's
most popular waters, including the Provo (recently it was discovered as far
downstream as the Blue Ribbon section below Deer Creek and on into Orem),
Logan, Weber, and Beaver rivers, as well as Rockport, Deer Creek, Otter
Creek, Minersville, Jordanelle, and Hyrum reservoirs. Whirling disease also
has been found in the Green River above Flaming Gorge. Biologists believe
it is only a matter of time before it reaches Utah's most prized trout
river, the Green below Flaming Gorge. As a measure against the disease,
Wyoming has stopped planting kokanee [a small type of landlocked sockeye
salmon in Flaming Gorge.
The life cycle of the parasite begins when it is eaten by a tubifex worm,
which grows and releases many more bugs into the water. The fish eats
either the worm or the parasite, which then attacks the head and spine of
the fish. When the fish dies and decomposes, the parasite is released,
eaten by the worm, and the cycle begins anew. There is, at this time, no
cure and no method of controlling the parasite. The parasite can be
distributed in a number of ways. It can be picked up in mud on boots or the
fender of a vehicle, carried off in contaminated fish to other watersheds,
or taken off by animals to new locations.
Symptoms include fish exhibiting whirling behavior, developing a deformed
head and/or curved spine, and eventually dying from stress from the
disease, an increased vulnerability to predations, or the disease itself.
It once was believed [that the disease could only infect young fish, but
new findings prove differently. "We're now seeing whirling disease in some
of the larger fish we're stocking. For example, we're seeing the sloped
heads in some larger cutthroats," Wilson said. "Where we used to think the
older fish were immune, we're now finding even they can be infected. Also,
we used to think splake [a fertile hybrid of a brook trout male and lake
trout female and brown trout were immune. That's not true any more."
Initially, there was a lot of hysteria related to the disease, with visions
of millions of dead fish being deposited on shores and beaches. "That
hasn't happened," Wilson said. "What we've found is different waters
respond differently to the disease. Each watershed is unique, and there's
no way to adequately predict the impact. In places like Minersville and
Otter Creek, the last couple of times we tested, we couldn't even tell it
was there. Other places, like the Bear River and Porcupine, we found last
summer 100 per cent of the small kokanee salmon were infected with whirling
disease. In other waters we've found the small fry (fish up to an inch)
disappearing at a much higher rate than we would normally expect. We see
everything from signs of being non-existent to being pretty serious."
For now, all biologists can do is continue to study the disease and try to
contain it. Last week it was found in 2 private ponds, one in Bicknell,
near where it was first discovered in 1991, and in a second in Kaysville.
Live fish from the Bicknell pond were sold to 4 other locations. The state
is testing those ponds for possible contamination.
By coincidence, Salt Lake City is site of a whirling disease symposium
Thursday and Friday titled "Whirling Disease: A Decade of Discovery."
Leading experts, researchers and policy makers from around the country will
be here to share the latest findings on the disease.
