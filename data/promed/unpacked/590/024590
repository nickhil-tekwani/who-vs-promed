The health ministry yesterday [5 Jan 2018] said the number of people diagnosed with hepatitis E has increased to 152 since the outbreak about 3 weeks ago in Windhoek, Khomas region. Health minister Bernard Haufiku declared the outbreak on 14 Dec 2017. At the time, Haufiku said the disease had killed one person, a pregnant mother, who died at the Katutura Intermediate Hospital.

The health ministry's chief medical superintendent Dr David Uirab, who is also the acting permanent secretary, said things are not going as expected. "So far, we have recorded 152 cases. We are working hard to stop the virus from spreading through holding community meetings. Our worry now is that most people are out of town, but that is not stopping us as we are continually announcing on different radio stations. We are also working on building more toilets in the affected informal settlements, and even water purification facilities," said Uirab. The groups on the ground are also submitting reports every day, and social mobilization to the general public is ongoing.

In December 2017, Haufiku said the most affected areas were Havana, Goreangab Dam, Hakahana, Greenwell Matongo and Ombili.

UNICEF communications specialist Judy Matjila, who attended the briefing in December 2017, said behavioral change enables people to engage in participatory processes to define their needs and demand their rights. "When we teach our children the right things like washing their hands properly with soap and water and keeping their environment clean, they will. Because children are good in bringing change at home, let us start with them," Matjila said.

[Hepatitis E is found worldwide, and different genotypes of the hepatitis E virus determine differences in epidemiology. For example, genotype 1 is usually seen in developing countries and causes community-level outbreaks, while genotype 3 is usually seen in the developed countries and does not cause outbreaks. Globally, 57 000 deaths and 3.4 million cases of acute hepatitis E are attributable to infection with hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 and 2. Many of the deaths are in pregnant women, characteristic of genotype 1.

The highest seroprevalence rates (number of persons in a population who test positive for the disease) are observed in regions where low standards of sanitation increase the risk for transmission of the virus. Over 60 per cent of all hepatitis E infections and 65 per cent of all hepatitis E deaths occur in East and South Asia, where seroprevalence rates of 25 per cent are common in some age groups. In Egypt, half the population aged above 5 years is serologically positive for the hepatitis E virus (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs280/en/index.html). - Mod.LL
