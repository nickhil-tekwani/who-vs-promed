[The 4 Jul 2014 edition of the DOMactu (http://www.domactu.com/actualite/147445603478792/guadeloupe-52-000-cas-de-chikunguyna/ in French] indicated that there are 52 000 cases of chikungunya virus infection in Guadeloupe.

The Americas
Date: 6 Jul 2014
Source: Examiner [edited]
http://www.examiner.com/article/chikungunya-illnesses-continue-to-spread


The weekly data on the number of chikungunya cases in the Western Hemisphere has been released by both the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The 2 international public health agencies released their data on 5 Jul [2014]. The data show that the number of cases and the number of countries or territories affected by the mosquito borne illness continue to climb.

The PAHO is reporting a total of 264 444 suspected or confirmed cases of chikungunya. The illness has been diagnosed in 22 countries or territories. The Dominican Republic and the French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe have reported the greatest numbers.

The ECDC shows a higher number of chikungunya illnesses, 285 406. The difference is that reports to the ECDC from Martinique and Guadeloupe have a higher number of suspected cases. The ECDC is also reporting 22 chikungunya-related deaths.

Neither agency has the most accurate reporting. Paperwork is taking a backseat to other priorities in many of these small, impoverished nations. A compilation of public and media reports suggests that the actual number of chikungunya cases is well over 315 000.

How many people will catch chikungunya in this 1st wave of infections? Martinique and Guadeloupe have been reporting illnesses for 6 months. At this point, 11.7 per cent of the population of Martinique is believed to have caught the virus. On Guadeloupe, 13.1 per cent have.

The Dominican Republic has been reporting chikungunya illnesses for 3 months. In that time, based upon recent public announcements, 1.6 percent of the population has been infected. It is very likely that this estimate is lower than the actual number of infections.

Suspected or confirmed cases of chikungunya have recently been reported in the Cayman Islands, Brazil and Paraguay. The number of cases in El Salvador and Venezuela continues to increase.

The United States has not been immune to the increase in chikungunya cases. To date, the only locally acquired illnesses have been in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. Reporting varies, but that number is 20-23 for Puerto Rico and 3 in the Virgin Islands. The PAHO is also reporting an additional 119 suspected chikungunya cases in Puerto Rico.

In the continental United States, the latest reporting by state agencies is 141 imported cases of chikungunya in 29 states. Florida has seen 54 cases, followed by New York and Tennessee with 8 each. There have been no locally acquired chikungunya illnesses yet.

[2] Cases in various countries:
Caribbean countries with ongoing transmission not included in the WHO/PAHO report above.
---
Martinique. 5 Jun 2014. The French ARS (regional health agency) has unveiled the results of a small survey conducted during 2 Saturdays. On the island, 20 districts, 500 households and 1600 people were interviewed: 1 of 1.5 to 2 sick individuals actually went to see a physician. Instead of the 43 550 estimated cases on Martinique, which correspond to consultations of general practitioners, although not statistically significant, there would be close to 65 000 cases or even 87 000 cases http://www.martinique.franceantilles.fr/actualite/sante/chik-65-000-a-87-000-cas-262113.php [in French, trans. and submitted Roland Hubner]

[This is the area in Italy where a chikungunya fever outbreak, ex India, was initiated in 2007 due to presence of an established population of _Aedes albopictus_ (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20071210.3980).

Japan (Narita). 2 Jun 2014. A case of chikungunya virus infection was laboratory-confirmed in a Japanese traveler returning from Commonwealth of Dominica (Dominica) by the quarantine screening at Narita international airport in Japan. She stayed in Dominica for 16 days in June 2014 and had mosquito-bites there. On the way to Japan, she visited a clinic in Puerto Rico having symptoms of fever, general fatigue and arthralgia and was prescribed antipyretics with suspected dengue.

Arriving at Narita International Airport in Japan, she still had a low grade fever (37.5 C [99.5 F]) without antipyretics and arthralgia and came to the health consultation room of Narita Airport Quarantine Station. She was examined, and her blood sample was tested for dengue, chikungunya and malaria. The chikungunya virus gene was detected by Real-time RT-PCR, but neither dengue nor malaria was detected. In 2013, 13 cases of chikungunya were reported in Japan among international travelers. Almost all of them were imported cases from South or Southeast Asia. [This report was kindly provided by Yasuko Honma MD, Chief of Quarantine Division, Narita Airport Quarantine Station <honma-yasuko@keneki.go.jp>, who is thanked for this submission. Mod.TY]
