Mass bird deaths found in European Russian region
-----------------------------------------------
Russian health workers have found mass bird deaths in a region to the west
of the Ural mountains, in what could become the 1st case of the deadly bird
flu virus spreading to Europe, officials said on Wednesday [17 Aug 2005].
Russia has fought to contain a bird flu outbreak since mid-July 2005, when
the 1st case of the disease -- which can also kill humans -- was registered
in Siberia and later in neighboring Kazakhstan and Mongolia.
The Russian state health watchdog, in a statement posted on its Web site,
said the bird deaths occurred on a farm in the Caspian region of Kalmykia,
2000 km (1200 miles) from the region where Russia's 1st flu outbreak was
reported. It was unclear whether bird flu had caused those deaths.
"This case is being investigated," the Federal Consumers' Rights and
Welfare Watchdog said, adding that no cases among humans had been confirmed
in Russia.
Kalmykia is 1800 km south of Moscow and is the only Buddhist region in Europe.
The epidemic, officially identified in 6 Siberian regions, has yet to be
confirmed on the western side of the Ural mountains, separating Asia from
Europe.
Officials fear migrating birds could export it to Western Europe, Africa
and the Middle East over the coming months.
Additionally, Interfax news agency reported from the industrial region of
Chelyabinsk, where officials confirmed the 1st case of the deadly H5N1
strain this week [3rd week August 2005], that the virus had struck another
village in the region: Barsuchye.

Mass bird deaths found in European Russian region
-----------------------------------------------
Veterinary workers continued slaughtering thousands of fowl in Russia's
remote Siberian and Urals regions amid fears that the bird flu epidemic had
spread further to the European part of the country.
More than 13 000 birds have died from the H5N1 strain of the bird flu,
which can fatally infect humans, and more than 112 000 have been
slaughtered to prevent the spread of the disease, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said on its Web site.
The epidemic, 1st registered in western Siberia in July 2005, has been
blamed on 2 kinds of wild birds [which ones?] migrating from Southeast
Asia, ministry spokesman Sergei Vlasov said.
While the epidemic has already spread to the Ural Mountains, which separate
the Asian and European parts of the country, fears grew on Wednesday [17
Aug 2005] that birds in the southern region of Kalmykia could also be infected.
Russia's consumer rights watchdog said on its Web site that an owner of a
small farm in Kalmykia had reported many deaths among domestic fowl there.
Experts were investigating the incident.
Rossiya televisions showed footage, from the Urals' Chelyabinsk region, of
veterinary workers clad in long white robes, gloves and masks putting
slaughtered fowl into black plastic sacks and into a metal container for
incineration.
No cases of human infection have been found in Russia, the AP reported.
The country's public health chief warned this week [3rd week August 2005]
in a letter to regional health officials that the virus could reach the
Black Sea and Caspian Sea regions this autumn and speed through European
Russia by the spring.

[Confirmation or otherwise of the suspected outbreak in Kalmykia and an
official update with the missing data (such as the avian species involved)
on the recent outbreaks in 5 regions in Siberia, where the disease has
allegedly been identified after the initial outbreak in Novosibirsk, are
urgently anticipated. In addition, it will help to know which 2 migrating
birds have been pointed at by the Russian epidemiologists as transmitters
of the virus from Southeast Asia. - Mod.AS]
