Re: Undiagnosed illness, bovine - Cambodia: (PO), RFI
-----------------------------------------------------
PRO/MBDS has learned from a reliable source that this outbreak is due
to hemorrhagic septicemia, a disease that is endemic in Cambodia.
This diagnosis was made by the Provincial Veterinarians based on
clinical findings.

[The information above is a welcomed response to ProMED-mail's RFI in
posting 20090122.0276.

Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) is a major disease of cattle and
buffaloes occurring in many Asian and African countries, resulting in
high mortality and morbidity. For recent outbreaks in Cambodia's
neighbours, see ProMED-mail posting 20081102.3447 for Thailand and
ProMED-MBDS postings 20080314.1018 and 20080722.2217 for Laos.

HS is caused by _Pasteurella multocida_, a Gram-negative
coccobacillus residing mostly as a commensal in the upper respiratory
tract of animals. The Asian serotype (Carter and Heddleston system)
is B:2. In many Asian countries disease outbreaks mostly occur during
the climatic conditions typical of monsoon (high humidity and high
temperatures).

Most cases in cattle and buffalo are acute or peracute. A fever,
dullness, and reluctance to move are the 1st symptoms. Salivation and
a serous nasal discharge develop, and edematous swellings become
apparent in the pharyngeal region. These swellings spread to the
ventral cervical region and brisket. The mucous membranes are
congested. Respiratory distress occurs, and the animal usually
collapses and dies 6 to 24 hours after the 1st symptoms were seen.
Either sudden death or a protracted course up to 5 days are also
possible. Animals with clinical signs, particularly buffalo, rarely
recover. Chronic cases do not seem to occur.

At necropsy, widespread hemorrhages, edema, and hyperemia are seen.
Swelling of the head, neck, and brisket occurs in nearly all cases.
This edema consists of a coagulated serofibrinous mass with
straw-colored or bloodstained fluid. Similar swellings can also be
found in the musculature. Subserosal petechial hemorrhages may occur
throughout the body, and the thoracic and abdominal cavities often
contain blood-tinged fluid. Pneumonia or gastroenteritis occasionally
occur, but usually are not extensive. Atypical cases, with no throat
swelling and extensive pneumonia, are sometimes seen.

The diagnosis of the disease is based on the clinical signs, gross
pathological lesions, morbidity and mortality patterns, and
confirmation by isolation of the pathogens and their conventional and
molecular characterisation.

In the recent past, HS has been identified as a secondary
complication in cattle and buffalos following outbreaks of
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). This could have also been the case in
the Cambodian outbreak, erroneously ascribed in the initial newswire
to cowpox. Since the current diagnosis as HS seems to have been based
upon clinical observations only, laboratory confirmation, which
deserves to include also virological investigation with special
attention to FMD, would be expected. - Mod.AS]
