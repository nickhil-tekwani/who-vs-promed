Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services (HCPHES) has
been notified that a member of the waiter staff of a restaurant
located in north Harris County has tested positive for hepatitis A.
The employee is reported to have only worked at the Pappasito's
Cantina located at 15280 I-45 North (at Airtex) Houston, TX, 77090
while he was still infectious. Employees and customers who were at
this restaurant on the following dates may have been exposed to
hepatitis A: 23-27 Jan 2007, 30-31 Jan, 1-3 Feb 2007, and 7-9 Feb 2007.
Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by a virus. Most people recover
from hepatitis A without any major long-term health problems after
several weeks. It is passed from person to person when someone does
not wash his or her hands well after going to the bathroom. A person
with hepatitis A is infectious from about 2 weeks before to one week
after he or she experiences jaundice (yellowing of the skin and
whites of the eyes). Infants and children who are infected with
hepatitis A do not always have symptoms, but they are still
infectious. People who already have liver problems can become very
ill if they get hepatitis A. If you have ever had hepatitis A you
cannot get it again.
HCPHES highly recommends that persons who worked or ate at this
Pappasito's Cantina (15280 I-45 North, Houston, TX, 77090) on 7, 8 or
9 Feb 2007 receive an immune globulin (IG) shot. Immune globulin (IG)
contains antibodies to help prevent people from developing disease.
To make sure that people who worked or ate at this restaurant on 7, 8
or 9 Feb 2007, have access to the appropriate medication, HCPHES will
provide free immune globulin (IG) shots on Tue 20 Feb through Thu 22
Feb from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Mangum-Howell Center (formerly
known as the Doss Community Center) located at 2500 Frick Road,
Houston, TX 77038. HCPHES is asking for everyone to bring
immunization records for all adults and children who will receive the
immunization. (Adults and children who have been fully vaccinated for
Hepatitis A are not considered to be at risk for developing this
disease.) Although HCPHES is holding the free clinic, people are
welcome to go to their private physician or a travel clinic to get an
immune globulin (IG) shot at their own expense. Persons receiving
immune globulin (IG) should be sure to contact their physician if
they develop symptoms of Hepatitis A. (See below.)
Immune globulin (IG) is only effective if given within a 2-week
period after exposure to the disease. It will not help employees and
customers who were at the restaurant on these dates. However, these
persons are still considered to be at risk of developing the illness.
Hepatitis A symptoms can appear 15 to 50 days from exposure. So,
anyone who ate at this Pappasito's on 23 to 27 Jan, 30 and 31 Jan,
and/or 1 and 3 Feb [2007], should be sure to go to their doctor as
soon as possible if they experience the following symptoms of
hepatitis A: extreme tiredness, fever, nausea and/or vomiting,
stomach pain or diarrhea, light colored stool, or dark, rust colored
urine, and jaundice (yellowish eyes and skin.)

We're learning as many as 12 000 people in Houston may have been
exposed to hepatitis A at the Pappasito's restaurant on I-45. The
health department is planning to treat 3000 people with an antibiotic
[?] shot. And all of this is costing taxpayers here big money. In
terms of the cost to the county, it's being quoted as $88 500, all
for this one confirmed case. The biggest cost of the hepatitis case
was for the immune globulin shots. The county had to get a special
shipment from the manufacturer to treat the 3000 people who could
benefit from the treatment.
The health department has identified these 2007 dates for potential exposure:
January 23-27
January 30-31
February 1
February 3
February 7-9
It is believed the Pappasito's waiter who worked on those days may
have exposed up to 12 000 people to the virus. "What we want those
people to do is monitor themselves quite closely and if they develop
any signs or symptoms that they feel might be consistent with
hepatitis to go ahead and call their doctors," said Herminia Palacio
with Harris County Health and Environmental Services [HCPHES].
The health department issued a warning to Pappasito's for improper
hand washing and improper handling of ready-to-eat foods. Health
officials say the restaurant has rectified the problem. "They have
put changes in place that include things like using gloves for
handling what we call ready-to-eat foods," said Palacio.
As for the 3000 people or so who can still receive treatment, a
clinic opens Tue 20 Feb to begin handing out shots to prevent the
onset of the virus.
Hepatitis A is a virus that can cause [benign] liver disease. It's
rarely fatal and most people recover after several weeks. The
symptoms can include extreme tiredness, fever, nausea or vomiting.

[So far there has been no positive diagnosis of hepatitis A infection
in persons visiting the restaurant in Houston, Texas, where a
hepatitis A-positive member of the staff was employed. The Harris
County Public Health and Environmental Services are taking
commendable pre-emptive action to forestall a potentially serious
outbreak of hepatitis A that could affect up to 12 000 people.
