The total accumulated number of domestic swine in the affected holdings was, reportedly, 360 102, among which 7963 clinical cases, 4995 deaths, 337 335 destroyed animals, and 5147 slaughtered animals. In "wild boars" and "wild animals" (most probably, similarly boars) a total number of 432 cases have been reported out of 890 "susceptible animals".
