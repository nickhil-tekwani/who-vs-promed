The City Health Office (CHO) here said cases of rabies virus in the city have increased from January to February, this year [2014].

City Health Officer Dr. Emmanuel A. Plandano, during the press conference held recently, said 3 human deaths caused by rabies were recorded by the communicable disease coordinator in the 1st 2 months of this year [2014]. Dr. Plandano said the victims were from different barangays of the city: "One 50-year-old, male from Purok 10, BM died on 22 Jan 2014; one 8-year-old boy from Purok 5, BC died on 11 Feb 2014, and one 54-year-old, female from Purok 1, BS died last 26 Feb 2014."

"One case of rabies is already considered an epidemic, because a 100-meter radius of the rabies positive area should be quarantined, and all dogs and cats within this area should be immunized with anti-rabies vaccine to avoid proliferation of said virus; that is why we are asking the help of our friends from the tri-media to help us disseminate our campaign against rabies," Plandano added.

Plandano also said to avoid proliferation of the said virus, the city health office will continue their support to the veterinary office through its surveillance and advocacy on rabies immunization. They will also help in the conduct of free rabies vaccinations, especially in those areas identified as positive for rabies.

For his part, the Sangguniang Panlungsod Chairman of the Committee on Health, City Councilor Baltazar Abian, encouraged all pet owners to take care of their pets and be responsible enough to bring them to the doctors and have them vaccinated.

"Republic Act 9482, or the Anti-Rabies Act of 2007, and other local ordinances must be enforced to reprimand those irresponsible pet owners," Abian said.

[Though vaccination is free, and there is an active control programme, there are problems. Not only have they been suffering severe storms, but dog meat is regularly consumed, and vaccination is believed to make a dog unsafe for consumption (see Rabies - Philippines (04): (NC) comment 20130409.1633158), as do the various drugs used to euthanise dogs, and, all in all, limit control of this dog market. All this maintains a high risk rate for human rabies in the country; see http://web.gideononline.com/web/gdn_multi_graph_image.php?gdn_form=Z3JhcGhfaWQ9NDU4OS4wMVgsNDU4My4wMVgsMzc3My4wMVg=.
