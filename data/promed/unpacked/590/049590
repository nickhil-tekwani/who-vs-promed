Dodgy dips blamed for food poisoning
------------------------------------
Turkish dips have been blamed for a salmonella outbreak at a Brunswick
restaurant that left hundreds of people ill. Health authorities have
detected salmonella in 2 dips from the Alasya Restaurant -- hummus and
eggplant dip. Hummus is usually made from ground chickpeas and sesame
[paste] flavored with lemon and garlic.

More than 720 people have told health authorities they fell ill after
eating at Alasya Restaurant or Alasya 2 in Sydney Rd between 8 and 19 Jan
2005. The confirmed number of ill stands at 173, but will increase as more
tests are completed. So far at least 25 people, including several
children, have needed to be taken to hospital for treatment, while many
more have been treated in emergency departments.

At least 50 victims have tested positive for _Salmonella sp._. The strain
of salmonella found in the dips is the same strain found in one patient
[The strain is not stated in the piece - Mod.LL]. Authorities are awaiting
further test results to confirm that the rest of the victims have the same
type of _Salmonella_.

[Isolation of the organism from 2 separate food sources suggests a common
ingredient; cross-contamination of one from the other or both being
contaminated by a food handler.

Previous outbreaks of salmonellosis have been associated with food products
produced from sesame seeds. As reported in a previous ProMED posting
(Salmonella typhimurium DT104 - Australia, Europe 20010822.1980), between
1985 and 2001 the National Enteric Pathogen Surveillance Scheme (NEPSS) in
Australia recorded the isolation of 17 different _Salmonella_ spp. from
sesame seeds and sesame seed products, including hummus, tahini, and
halvah, on 30 occasions. Sesame seed products should always be considered
when attempting to identify a source of salmonellosis. - Mod.LL]
