Epidemiological update: outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) with onset in December 2013 is still evolving in Guinea. The 1st cases were reported from Gueckedou prefecture, a forested region of south-eastern Guinea near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. The alert was issued by the Ministry of Health on 10 Mar 2014.

Guinea
------
As of 10 May 2014, the Ministry of Health of Guinea has reported 233 clinical cases of EVD, including 157 deaths. The cumulative total of clinical EVD cases and deaths since the beginning of the outbreak by location is: Conakry (50 cases, including 24 deaths); Gueckedou (149/106); Macenta (23/17); Kissidougou (6/5), Dabola (4/4), and Djingaraye (1/1). As of 12 May 2014, the number of confirmed cases is 133, including 83 deaths.

There have been no new cases of EVD in Kissidougou since 1 Apr 2014, Macenta since 9 Apr 2014, and in Djingaraye and Dabola since end of March 2014. As of 12 May 2014, there was one patient in isolation in Conakry and 5 in Gueckedou. The date of isolation of the most recent confirmed case is 26 Apr 2014 in Conakry and 7 May 2014 in Gueckedou. 431 contacts are currently followed-up in Gueckedou and 13 in Conakry.

Sierra Leone
------------
As of 7 May 2014, no cases of EVD have been confirmed in Sierra Leone. Among the 106 patients presenting with a viral haemorrhagic fever-like illness between 16 Mar 2014 and 7 May 2014, no cases of EVD have been detected using ebolavirus PCR [polymerase chain reaction] assays and 10 patients with Lassa fever were confirmed.

Liberia
-------
As of 7 May 2014, the number of cases is 12 (6 confirmed, 2 probable, and 4 suspected) and 11 deaths. The most recent confirmed or probable case was on 6 Apr 2014.

WHO and international organisations are supporting the Ministries of Health of Guinea and Liberia in their EVD prevention, contract tracing, health care, and control related activities. No cases have been detected in returning travellers in Europe.

Conclusions: This is the 1st time an Ebola virus disease outbreak is reported in West Africa. The outbreak seems to be slowing down, however still evolving notably in Gueckedou because the last patient was reported in isolation the 7 May 2014, which supports the possibility of a recent chain of transmission. Prevention and control activities will be continued in order to stop the transmission of EVD. Isolation of cases, active monitoring of contacts and other control measures currently being implemented in the affected countries with the support of medical humanitarian organisation such as Medecins Sans Frontieres, EU scientists and an EU funded mobile laboratory in Gueckedou, and WHO.

The risk of infection for travellers visiting Guinea and Liberia is considered very low. Most human infections result from direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions from an infected human, and the highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes and unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids.

[2] Gambia: flight ban removed
Date: Wed 14 May 2014
Source: NDTV, Agence France-Presse (AFP) report [edited]
http://www.ndtv.com/article/world/gambia-lifts-flight-bans-as-guinea-says-ebola-spread-slowed-523828


The Gambia has lifted a ban on flights from Liberia and Sierra Leone imposed at the peak of the Ebola virus disease outbreak as Guinea said the spread of the deadly virus had "slowed significantly." The outbreak in Guinea is one of the deadliest in history, with 233 cases "clinically compatible" with Ebola virus disease reported, and 157 deaths since the start of the year [2014], according to the World Health Organization. "The general public is hereby informed that airlines serving Banjul and the sub-region can now pick up passengers in Liberia and Sierra Leone," said a statement issued by the Gambian Transport ministry. President Yahya Jammeh ordered airlines to cancel all flights from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone on [10 Apr 2014] in a bid to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. The new statement, dated Sunday [11 May 2014] made no mention of Guinea, although it said further information would be communicated in due course.

The spread of Ebola virus disease has "slowed significantly", with no new cases in Conakry since 26 Apr 2014, Guinea's health ministry said on [Tue 13 May 2014]. The total number of laboratory-confirmed Ebola cases in Guinea is 133, including 83 deaths, it added. "This is positive news for us. The restriction on the movement of people from Sierra Leone to the Gambia has nearly crippled my business," said a Sierra Leone businesswoman who buys textiles from the Gambia for sale in Freetown.

The Gambian government has not revealed how effective the ban was at keeping out travellers from Liberia and Sierra Leone. "I travel from Freetown to Dakar by flight and from there, I travel by road to the Gambia," a Gambian who asked not to be named told AFP [Agence France-Presse]. "Since Sierra Leone did not register any cases of Ebola, I don't think it was prudent to ask flights servicing the sub-region not to pick up passengers from Freetown to Banjul."

The Ebola virus disease outbreak across west Africa began in the impoverished country's southern forests, spreading to Conakry, a sprawling port city on the Atlantic coast and home to 2 million people. Liberia has reported 6 lab-confirmed cases, 6 probable or suspected cases, and 11 deaths, while Sierra Leone had 2 suspected cases of Ebola, both of which turned out to be Lassa fever.

The Gambia, a country of about 1.8 million, is a finger of territory flanking the Gambia River, with Senegal on either side and a narrow Atlantic coastline.

[These reports confirm that the Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa appears now to be in decline as a consequence of the public health responses that have developed. It seems unlikely that the imposition and subsequent lifting of the inter-country flight ban, has had any significant influence on the course of the outbreak. - Mod.CP
