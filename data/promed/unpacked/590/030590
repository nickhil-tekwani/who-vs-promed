The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS] has announced the state is experiencing an increase in legionellosis cases. To date in 2019, there have been 140 confirmed cases of legionellosis reported in 38 counties compared to 135 confirmed cases during the same timeframe in 2018, the department says. Confirmed cases include 19 in Oakland county, 16 in Wayne county, 13 in Macomb county, 11 in Genesee county, and 10 cases each in the City of Detroit and Kent county.

"This increase corresponds with national increases in legionellosis. Legionellosis is most common in the summer and early fall when warming, stagnant waters present the best environment for bacterial growth in water systems. MDHHS and local health departments are working to inform healthcare providers of the increase in cases and share information regarding testing and treatment."

"With warmer days now here, we want everyone to be aware of legionnaires' disease, especially if they may be at higher risk for illness," said Dr Joneigh Khaldun, MDHHS chief medical executive and chief deputy director for health. "We also want all healthcare providers to remain vigilant and test and treat appropriately."

[The city of Flint, Michigan, with an estimated population of about 100 000 in 2017, is the largest city and county seat of Genesee county (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint,_Michigan). In 2014-2015, Flint faced a major public health emergency due to lead poisoning and a legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak, attributed to the switch in its water supply in April 2014 from Lake Huron water (via Detroit) to the more corrosive Flint River water without implementing anti-corrosive measures. The Flint River water is said to be highly corrosive: 19 times more so than the water from the Great Lakes, according to researchers from Virginia Tech. Failure to use anti-corrosive treatment on the Flint River water is believed to have led to higher lead levels, as well as higher iron and lower chlorine levels, which were believed to have led to elevated levels of _Legionella_ in the city's water and to an increased risk of acquiring LD. During this period, there were 91 confirmed cases of LD, when only 12 would have been expected, in Genesee county.

Flint switched back to less corrosive Lake Huron water in mid-October 2015. There subsequently were 16 LD cases in 2016 and 13 in 2017 in Genesee county, but the number of LD cases doubled in Genesee county in 2018 to 26 cases, for unknown reasons (https://gchd.us/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/WEB-LD-Summary-CY2019-5.13.2019.pdf).

In Michigan as a whole, the number of cases of LD increased over 500 percent since 2003, from 125 cases to 633 in 2018, according to the MDHHS, for unknown reasons (https://www.crainsdetroit.com/hospitality/state-opens-new-investigation-legionnaires-case-mclaren-flint).

Similarly, the CDC reports that the number of cases of LD in the US nationally has increased 550 percent since 2000 to almost 7500 cases of LD in 2017 (https://www.crainsdetroit.com/health-care/legionnaires-cases-increase-state-2018-death-rates-drop). The CDC suggests that this number may be actually even higher because LD is likely underdiagnosed. The CDC notes that it is unclear whether this increased incidence represents artifact (due to increased awareness and testing), increasing susceptibility of the population, increased _Legionella_ in the environment, or some combination of factors (https://www.cdc.gov/legionella/about/history.html). - Mod.ML
