Some cows have been infected with O-type foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with 36 diseased and 12 that succumbed to the sickness. The local government has culled 100 infected cows as well as those that had contact with them, and those slaughtered as a precaution have now been declared disease-free, thus bringing the local outbreak under effective control, per the statement.

[This seems to be the 1st confirmation of FMDV serotype O in the territory of China's Inner Mongolia province. Several dozen FMD outbreaks have been reported from China since January 2017, as can be seen on OIE's interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/y7dcl7sj (click on China's border with Mongolia, zoom in). As apparent, not a single outbreak has been reported from the territory of Inner Mongolia (Nei Mongol Autonomous Region). Such absence is striking in view of the abundant number of outbreaks reported from the eastern half of adjacent Mongolia. Official report notifying the outbreak, is expected to include further epidemiological data and statistics.
