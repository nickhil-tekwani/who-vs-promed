Encephalitis kills 46 in northern India
------------------------------------------
46 people [an approximate death rate of 20 percent, given the number
hospitalized], mostly children, have died of encephalitis, which is
sweeping parts of India's northern Uttar Pradesh state, health officials
said on Wednesday.
Another 180 people are in hospital, many of them in a critical condition,
following the outbreak during the monsoon season.
The water-borne disease, an acute form of brain fever dubbed Japanese
Encephalitis, is caused by a virus spread by mosquitoes.
"90 percent of the victims are children," O.P. Singh, director-general of
the state's health department, told Reuters.
"Though it is not unusual for the killer virus to proliferate during every
rainy season, the damage is likely to be worse this time."
About 50 people died of the disease in Uttar Pradesh in 2004.
India has experienced heavy monsoon rains in 2005, and poor sanitation has
raised fears of water-borne diseases in the affected regions.

[Although no detailed information was available on the outbreak of
encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state, which affected mostly children (90
percent), suspicion of a viral etiology -- very likely Japanese
encephalitis virus, though other etiological agents have not been ruled out
(see also:20050715.2028) -- seems not farfetched. Several ProMED Moderators
have commented in the past on recurrent viral encephalitis in this part of
the country during the monsoon season (see also: 20050619.1727). Such
instances often ended up with no definitive diagnosis through the end of
the annual outbreaks. ProMED would be grateful for further information from
anyone who is familiar with the situation and has expertise in the
epidemiology of waterborne encephalitis in this area. -Mod.RY]
