200 Indonesian tsunami survivors hit by suspected food poisoning
---------------------------------------------------
Some 200 people in a camp for tsunami homeless in Indonesia's Aceh
province have been hospitalized for what was believed to be food
poisoning from eating tainted noodles, officials said.
The incident late on 10 Feb 2005 is believed to be the 1st outbreak
of its kind in the dozens of makeshift camps holding many of the 400
000 people whose homes were destroyed in the 26 Dec 2004 disaster.
Abu Bakar, the chief of Panah Pasir, an area in northern Aceh, said
the sick were taken to hospital in the coastal city of Lhokseumawe
because they began vomiting and foaming at the mouth shortly after
consuming the noodles.
The batch of dried food was taken from emergency supplies at the camp
for 2100 people. Their origin was not immediately known, but
thousands of tons of rations have been distributed around Aceh to
feed disaster survivors.

[The etiology of this outbreak is unclear. Vomiting beginning
"shortly" after food ingestion could mean heavy metal contamination
of the water that the noodles were cooked in (usual incubation period
less than 30 minutes) or staphylococcal enterotoxin food poisoning
(usual incubation period 4-6 hours), among other possibilities. -
