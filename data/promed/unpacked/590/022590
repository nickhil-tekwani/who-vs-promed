Increasing Lab Confirmed Cases Of Influenza B Virus In Southwestern Europe
------------------------------------------------------------------------
11 networks in Europe reported no influenza activity to the European
Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS, <http://www.eiss.org/>) in the week
ending 29 Dec 2002 (week 52). 4 networks reported sporadic activity
(Belgium, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland), and one network (France)
reported regional activity (1). A report of no influenza activity indicates
that the overall level of clinical activity was at baseline levels. In
France, influenza activity was the highest in the Rhone-Alpes (south east),
the Midi-Pyrenees (southwest) and the Normandy (northwest) regions. The
intensity of clinical activity was medium in Spain and low in all of the
other networks.
A total of 3604 sentinel respiratory specimens have been tested for
influenza virus since 30 Sep 2002. Of these, 109 (3 percent) have tested
positive for influenza A or B. Influenza B virus was dominant, accounting
for 77 percent of the positive specimens. 23 percent were found to be
influenza A virus. EISS has received no reports this season of the
influenza A(H1N2) virus strain that circulated in Europe last season
(mainly in England and Ireland) (2). Most of the cases of influenza B virus
(86 percent) reported so far this season, have been reported by Spain (29),
France (26) and Portugal (18).
Influenza B infections have been the dominant influenza type in Portugal
and Spain in recent weeks. They have also been the most frequent in France,
but are co-circulating with influenza A viruses. Interestingly, in week
52/2002 the dominant virus in the Rhone-Alpes region was influenza B virus,
whereas in the Midi-Pyrenees it was influenza A(H1) virus (not yet fully
characterised), and in Normandy influenza B virus was co-circulating with
influenza A(H3N2) virus.
All of the influenza viruses detected/isolated so far this season by EISS
have been closely related to the 2002-03 influenza vaccine strains.
The total number of respiratory specimens collected by sentinel physicians
in week 52/2002 was 161 (compared to 305 in week 51/2002); 100 (62 percent)
of these were collected in France. The low numbers of specimens collected
is a reflection of the holiday period. The percentage of sentinel specimens
that tested positive for influenza (A or B) viruses was 5.6 percent,
ranging from 0 percent in most networks to 8 percent in France.
The surveillance of influenza in week 52/2002 was affected by the
Christmas/New Year holidays. The clinical and virological data are sent
with a delay and/or processed more slowly than usual, and the EISS database
is not yet complete. These factors can affect the apparent clinical
morbidity rates in some countries, and the data for week 52/2002 should
therefore be interpreted with caution.
EISS aims to contribute to a reduction in morbidity and mortality
associated with influenza in Europe. One of the ways it does this is by
publishing a Weekly Electronic Bulletin on influenza activity in Europe.
This bulletin describes the epidemiological and virological spread of
influenza in the 19 countries (22 surveillance networks) that are members
of EISS. During the current influenza season, EISS includes 28 national
reference laboratories, at least 10 600 sentinel physicians and covers a
total population of 441 million inhabitants.
