Condition Of Rural Anthrax in Argentina 2011
-------------------------------------------
Summary:
This report of the Annual Condition of Rural Carbuncle produced by the spore bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_ has been created every year since 2004. This zoonosis infects animals and occupationally exposed people. The yearly scenarios assessed by "Participative Epidemiology" are the following:

1 - Assessment [Surveillance] Area of Rural Anthrax in the Province of Buenos Aires, where 5 bovine outbreaks took place: Of the 92 samples from acute bovine deaths, 5 (5 percent) were positive for _B. anthracis_; during 1977-2011, it was 12 percent (428 samples) of the 3655 samples submitted. [Two of the 5 were in fact in adjoining Cordoba Province, which is considered part of this surveillance area because of proximity and cattle movements in Jovita and Levalle. All outbreaks arose from a failure to vaccinate.]

2 - In the Alert and Response Zone, which involves the district of Azul, there was one outbreak of bovine anthrax [see 20110601.1676] and one Alert for vaccine exposure [A veterinarian accidentally injected himself while vaccinating a client's herd. He was treated with 7 days of ciprofloxacin. The area's annual bovine vaccine coverage averages 13 percent.].

3 - The isolations of _Bacillus anthracis_ by other diagnostic laboratories accounted for 19 outbreaks from the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa.

4 - The districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in anthrax outbreaks during 2011 were the following: Azul, Alvear, Trenque Lauquen, and Rauch.

5 - The national production of Sterne anti-anthrax vaccine for veterinary use was 18 774 050 doses by 11 laboratories.

6 - Cases of human anthrax: there were 3 cases in the area of the province of Buenos Aires; all of them affected the skin of males involved in rural tasks. [All 3 were males, aged 19 to 32 years, with cutaneous lesions involving fingers, hand, and forearm. Partidos affected were Olavarria, Chascomus, and Bartolome Mitre.]

7 - Other facts related to Rural Carbuncle: During 2011, a number of official reports were submitted, seminars given, and articles published by national and international bodies in the context of this disease. We have all the necessary solutions for its control, but the goal has not been achieved yet. In 1886, Louis Pasteur sent the 1st vaccine for veterinary use to Argentina to prevent this disease. We are optimistic about fulfilling that goal.

[Outbreaks occurred in the following Argentine provinces during 2011: Buenos Aires: Adolfo Alsina (1 case), Azul (1), General Alvear (1), Rauch (11), Trenque Lauquen (1);
Cordoba: Jovita (1 case), Levalle (1);
La Pampa: Atracan (3 cases), Hucal (1), Realico (1), and Toay (2).

The circumstances resulting in the human cases in the Buenos Aires partidos of Olavarria, Chascomus, and Bartolome Mitre are obscure.

Our Argentine colleagues are to be congratulated for their hard work, and as elsewhere, the problem is to persuade their estancieros in the high risk areas of the necessity of vaccinating their stock each spring. As the incidence falls, it gets harder and harder, even as the procrastinators demonstrate each year the importance of vaccination. - Mod.MHJ
