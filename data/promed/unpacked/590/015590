Crops still at risk of epidemics
---------------------------------
The Vietnam Economic Times newspaper spoke with Nguyen Quang Minh,
director of the Plant Protection Department, about eradicating brown
hoppers and related plant diseases:
"By June 8 [2007], the brown hopper area was 10 419 ha [25 745
acres], a decrease of 73 ha [180.38 acres] from the previous week.
The infection rate is low at 1000 hoppers per square metre. The areas
of rice with yellow stunt disease have lessened since last week to
52.4 ha [129.48 acres], a decrease of 742 ha [1833.5 acres]
week-on-week. About 356 ha [879.7 acres] of Dong Thap, Vinh Long, Bac
Lieu, Hau Giang, Long An and Tay Ninh provinces reportedly are still
battling the diseases.
"The eradication of yellow and stunt rice diseases in the districts
of Hong Dan (Bac Lieu Province), Chau Thanh, Long My (Hau Giang) and
the province of Tay Ninh is very slow. There isn't enough machinery
to take care of the problem; farmers are waiting around for
assistance.
"The Plant Protection Department is co-operating with local areas to
find a solution. We focus on helping farmers be vigilant over their
rice fields and spray insecticide that kills brown hoppers. In
provinces like Kien Giang, An Giang and Dong Thap, better brown
hopper prevention methods should be put in place so summer-autumn and
autumn-winter rice crops aren't affected.
"The growing seasons have been affected by brown hoppers. Officials
of the Food and Agriculture Organisation were surprised at our method
of minimising the spread of brown hoppers, but it's the most
effective way we've found so far. It's necessary to raise water
levels to cover the rice seedlings so brown hoppers will emerge and
be easily seen, making killing them much easier. Farmers who don't
follow the schedule we've set for crop seasons will get more brown
hoppers.
"The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development asked the Mekong
Delta Rice Institute and Plant Protection Institute to test any
chemical products against these rice diseases. But as far as we know,
there hasn't been any treatment for the viruses. A kind of fertiliser
was used for some fields in Long An which helps brings yellow leaves
back to life but can't kill the virus."

[In addition to _Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV) and _Rice ragged
stunt virus_ (RRSV) discussed in the previous post no. 20070611.1899
('Virus disease, rice - Viet Nam'), at least one further rice virus
is implicated in this report: _Rice yellow stunt virus_ (RYSV; genus
_Nucleorhabdovirus_, family _Rhabdoviridae_; synonym _Rice transitory
yellowing virus_, RTYV). Its only natural host is rice where it
causes leaf yellowing, reduced tillering, and mild stunting. Later,
infected plants develop normal-looking leaves and may appear healthy,
but symptoms may reappear after this temporary recovery. RYSV is
transmitted in a persistent manner by the green rice leafhoppers
_Nephotettix cincticeps_, _N. nigropictus_ and _N. virescens_. Since
RGSV and RRSV are transmitted by brown planthoppers (_Nilaparvata
lugens_) it appears that there may be a mixture of different brown
and green hopper species in the region.
The incidence of RYSV is generally low in the 1st rice crop and high
in the 2nd crop. After the harvest of late-planted rice, RTYV
overwinters in rice stubble or in the vector.
Weed hosts may also play a role in the infection cycle. RYSV shares
common vectors (_N. cincticeps_ and _N. nigropictus_) with _Rice
dwarf virus_ (RDV; genus _Phytoreovirus_, family _Reoviridae_) and
they frequently occur together. Whether this is the case in southern
Viet Nam is unclear from the report above.
Green rice leafhoppers (_N. virescens_ and other spp.) are also
vectors of _Rice tungro bacilliform virus_ (RTBV; genus "_RTBV-like
viruses_", family _Caulimoviridae_) and _Rice tungro spherical virus_
(RTSV; genus _Waikavirus_, family _Sequiviridae_). Both these viruses
together cause the rice tungro disease and are also present in parts
of the Mekong Delta area (see link for distribution map below).
Tungro is one of the most damaging rice diseases in South East Asia
with losses up to 100 percent.
