With regards to the posting on April 12 regarding Buruli ulcer in the
Congo: What was the basis of diagnosis for these cases? AFB stain? Pathology?
Several aspects of the disease do not seem consistent with Buruli ulcer.
The earliest stage of Buruli ulcer is a nodular stage....ulceration does
not typically occur for weeks or even months....probably because of the
very slow growth of the organism.
Although it is true that up to 15 percent of a population may be affected,
there is no evidence that this is a disease that rapidly spreads by
contact. In fact, all epidemiological data, including CDC studies conducted
in Cote d'Ivoire, other studies (in both Africa and Australia) suggest that
infection is contracted from environmental exposure. The rapid course and
contagious nature of the infections described in the Congo are probably
incompatible with any mycobacterial infection.

[Pam Small's observations call into question the diagnosis of the syndrome
described in the original article (the first ProMED-mail posting cited
above). It is impossible to know whether the journalist has made errors in
describing the disease progression, or whether the illness is something
other than a mycobacterial infection. If there are subscribers with
first-hand knowledge of the situation in the Congo, their insights would be
appreciated. - Mod.ES
