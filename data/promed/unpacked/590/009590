Nearly 200 meningitis cases during Hajj not an epidemic, Saudi says
-------------------------------------------------------------------
AFP reported on 12 Apr 2000 that Saudi Arabia's health ministry denied on
Wednesday, 12 Apr 2000, that there was an epidemic of meningitis in the
kingdom after nearly 200 people had been diagnosed with the illness [Does
"the illness" refer to meningitis or to disease due to _N. meningitidis_? -
Man. Ed. DS since the annual Muslim pilgrimage, or Hajj, last month.
A ministry statement carried by the official SPA news agency said pilgrims
coming from abroad who were carrying vaccination papers but who had not
been properly vaccinated had been diagnosed with the illness. [This does
not exclude the possibility that there were also those who were properly
vaccinated but who subsequently became ill. - DS
"The number of cases registered up to the morning of April 11 [2000 is not
quite 200," the ministry said, adding that "people coming from abroad to
perform the pilgrimage were the origin of the microbe."
"The number of recorded cases ... cannot be considered an epidemic," the
ministry said. [What is the normal number of cases for this same time
period based upon historical data? - DS
"The origin of this illness is not in Mecca or Saudi Arabia, only 11 cases
having been registered in the kingdom in the first 10 months of the Muslim
year of 1420" which finished on Apr 5 2000, "which is a low average
compared to other countries."
"The number of cases started to increase with the arrival of the pilgrims,
reaching its peak during the last week of March, with 56 cases," the
statement said, not specifying whether anyone had died from the illness.
The ministry said "the situation had stabilised", with just 18 cases of
meningitis having being recorded in the period from April 6-11.
"The kingdom strictly applies rules of prevention against meningitis ...
and carries out compulsory vaccinations on all pilgrims not carrying
medical certificates verifying they have been vaccinated" upon arrival, it
added. Vaccinations had been given to 335,547 foreign pilgrims at ports,
airports and land border crossings during the pilgrimage which climaxed in
mid-March.
A record 1.267 million Muslims travelled to Saudi Arabia from around the
world this year, notably due to an increase in pilgrim numbers from
southeast Asia where an economic recovery is underway.

[The idea that people from the UK or France, two countries that have
reported _N. meningitidis_ infections in returning pilgrims and their
contacts, would be carrying falsified vaccination papers or were "not
properly immunized" seems a bit unlikely, unless by not properly immunized
the Saudi authorities mean that they received vaccines against only
serogroups A and C. So, the issue of vaccine failure still hasn't been
answered satisfactorily. It remains important to learn additional
information about the vaccination status of confirmed _N. meningitidis_
serogroup W135 cases. Typing data for a larger percentage of the 200 cases
would also be helpful. - Man. Ed. DS
