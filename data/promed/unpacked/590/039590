On 9 Feb 2022, WHO was notified by the United Kingdom health authorities of 2 laboratory-confirmed cases and one probable case of Lassa fever. As of 18 Feb [2022], 3 cases have been confirmed and one death has been reported. These are the 1st reported Lassa fever cases in the United Kingdom since 2009, and represents the 2nd known case of secondary transmission of Lassa fever in Europe.

The 1st case travelled to Mali in late 2021, where Lassa fever is endemic. After returning to the United Kingdom, the individual developed symptoms of fever, fatigue, and loose stool, and was subsequently hospitalized. The 1st case has now recovered. The 2nd and 3rd cases were family members of the 1st case and did not travel to Mali. Both were admitted to the hospital, and the 3rd case, sadly, has died.

On 8 Feb [2022], samples from both the 1st and 2nd cases were laboratory-confirmed positive for Lassa virus by PCR. The 3rd case was initially provided care as a probable case of Lassa fever, and the diagnosis was confirmed on 9 Feb [2022].

Public health response
Incident responses have been activated by health authorities in the United Kingdom to coordinate the clinical and public health management of these cases.

People with exposure to the cases were identified through robust contact-tracing activities. Low- and high-risk contacts are being followed up for 21 days after their last exposure. Post-exposure prophylaxis has been offered to high-risk contacts with the most significant exposures. Systems are in place to assess and manage any contacts who may develop symptoms during the follow-up period.

WHO risk assessment
Lassa fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic fever illness that is primarily transmitted to humans via contact with food or household items contaminated with infected _Mastomys_ rats' urine or faeces. Human-to-human transmission is rare but can occur through direct contact with the blood, urine, faeces, or other bodily secretions, particularly in health-care settings. It can cause severe disease in about 20% of patients. The case fatality ratio (CFR) is 1% overall and 15% in severely ill patients. Early recognition and initiation of patient care decreases the CFR and public health impact.

Lassa fever is endemic in Mali, and sporadic cases have been exported to Europe from countries in West Africa, where the disease is endemic, such as Sierra Leone, Togo, Liberia, and Nigeria in recent years. However, the secondary transmission of Lassa fever through human contacts is known to be extremely rare when appropriate infection prevention and control [IPC] precautions and laboratory biosafety measures are applied. The only secondary transmission of Lassa fever reported in Europe was in 2016 from Germany, when the secondary case performed post-mortem care of a fatal case.

Human-to-human transmission occurs in both community and health-care settings, where the virus may be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as reused needles, as well as direct contact with bodily secretions. Health-care workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate IPC practices, although information from recent imported cases in Europe show that secondary transmission of Lassa virus is rare when standard IPC precautions are followed. The possibility of additional secondary cases related to transmission in a health-care setting cannot currently be excluded, but is considered very unlikely in the community.

WHO advice
Prevention of Lassa fever in endemic countries relies on community engagement and promoting hygienic conditions to discourage rodents from entering homes. Family members and health-care workers should always be careful to avoid contact with blood and body fluids while caring for sick individuals.

In health-care settings, staff should consistently implement standard IPC measures when caring for patients to prevent nosocomial infections. Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, or handling their clinical specimens, should reinforce standard and contact precautions, comprising appropriate hand hygiene, rational use of personal protective equipment (PPE), environmental cleaning, isolation, safe injections practices, and safe burial practices. To avoid any direct contact with blood and body fluids and/or splashes onto facial mucosa (eyes, nose, mouth) when providing direct care for a patient with suspected or confirmed Lassa virus, personal protective equipment should include 1) clean non-sterile gloves; 2) clean, non-sterile fluid-resistant gown; and 3) protection of facial mucosa against splashes (mask and eye protection, or a face shield).

Given the nonspecific presentation of viral haemorrhagic fevers, isolation of ill travellers and consistent implementation of standard and contact precautions is key to preventing secondary transmission. When consistently applied, these measures can prevent secondary transmission even if travel history information is not obtained, not immediately available, or the diagnosis of a viral haemorrhagic fever is delayed.

There is currently no approved vaccine. Early supportive care with rehydration and symptomatic treatment improves survival.

Considering the seasonal increases of cases between December and March, countries in West Africa that have endemic Lassa fever are encouraged to strengthen their related surveillance systems to enhance early detection and treatment of cases, and to reduce the case fatality rate, as well as to strengthen cross-border collaboration.

ProMED Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The above report finally identified the West African country where the index case acquired their Lassa fever virus infection: Mali. The other 2 cases did not acquire their infections in Mali and had not traveled there, but acquired them from the index case. Despite about 80% of Lassa fever virus infections being asymptomatic or very mild, the disease can be fatal, as was the unfortunate case cited in the above report. There is still no indication of the likely circumstances under which the index cases encountered the virus. In West Africa, person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever virus has occurred among healthcare workers in hospitals. Proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE) has reduced this risk. PPE undoubtedly has been used in the UK hospitals that these patients attended, and no further cases have been reported.
