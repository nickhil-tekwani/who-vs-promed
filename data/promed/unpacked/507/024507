Swedish officials have traced the source of a _Salmonella_ outbreak to a brand of chocolate wafers from Poland. Between late December 2020 and early April 2021, 32 people living in 15 counties fell ill after infection with the same type of _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis. 19 patients were children under the age of 10 while 9 people were above 70 years old. 17 females and 15 males were affected.

The outbreak was investigated by local infection control units, National Food Agency (Livsmedelsverket), and the Public Health Agency of Sweden (Folkhälsomyndigheten) with the 1st update in February 2021, when 12 people were sick. Through the national microbial surveillance program, the Public Health Agency of Sweden identified several cases infected with the same type of _Salmonella_ Enteritidis.

Local infection control units interviewed sick people about what they ate and where they bought food from before they became sick. This identified the suspected source of infection as a kind of chocolate wafer sold in Axfood stores. In analysis by the National Food Agency, _Salmonella_ was identified in chocolate wafers of the Eldorado brand. Axfood issued a recall of the batch in question, which came from Poland. Further testing showed the isolate from chocolate wafers was the same type as that found in patients which determined the source of infection.

The recall applies to Eldorado chocolate wafers 415-gram with a best before date of 15 Sep 2021 and batch number 350.3 E400:56. Axfood urged consumers who bought the product in question to return it to the store where it was purchased.

"We take this extremely seriously, and are now investigating with the supplier how it could have happened and how we can ensure that something similar does not happen again," said Axfood's Quality Manager Susanna Wadegård.
