Donovanosis, otherwise known as granuloma inguinale, has been getting some attention in the UK of late. That's because Robbie Purves writing for Birmingham Live [https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/health/what-donovanosis-flesh-eating-sti-21924441] quoted a doctor from London as saying, "Figures suggest that donovanosis -- which was previously thought to be restricted to places including India, Brazil, and New Guinea -- is becoming more common on these shores."

A look at data from Public Health England shows that there were 30 reported cases of donovanosis in the UK in 2019 [https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables]. That was higher than the 19 in 2016, the 26 in 2017, and the 21 in 2018. Last year, in 2020, the number of cases did dip to 18. But presumably, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people weren't sharing their genitals with each other quite as much.

Of course, the Public Health England numbers don't suggest that donovanosis is spreading like wildfire in the UK. The disease is still relatively rare over there and in the US, certainly less common than it is in particular tropical areas, such as India, Guyana, New Guinea, central Australia, and southern Africa, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/sexually-transmitted-diseases/granuloma-inguinale-donovanosis.html]. In fact, it's so uncommon that 3 years ago a single case of a woman in Southport, UK, getting donovanosis made headlines, which I covered for Forbes at the time [https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2018/08/23/what-is-donovanosis-a-so-called-flesh-eating-sexually-transmitted-infection/?sh=70cb9d942a23]. So you may not have to put "hide from flesh-eating STI [sexually transmitted infection]" on your list of main things to do today along with things such as "take out trash" and "purchase croissants."

It is, though, yet another reason to practice safe sex. Since it is considered an STI, you typically have to have sex to get donovanosis. The New South Wales government does say that a small proportion of cases have occurred through skin-to-skin nonsexual contact [https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/donovanosis.aspx]. But usually, it's transmitted via having vaginal, anal, or possibly oral sex with someone infected with _Klebsiella granulomatis_. This bacterium was formerly known as _Calymmatobacterium granulomatis_. So it shouldn't be comforting for someone to tell you after sex that he or she was infected with _C. granulomatis_ rather than _K. granulomatis_.

After you get infected, symptoms tend to appear 1 to 12 weeks later. The classic symptoms of donovanosis are painless ulcers in your genital region that progressively worsen and spread. People often call these lesions "beefy red" since blood vessels course through them and bleeding may occur. These lesions first appear as small, beefy-red bumps on your genitals or around the anus, depending on what body parts were involved in the deed. Over time, the skin on these bumps wears away, transforming them into "raised, beefy-red, velvety nodules called granulation tissue," in the words of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) [https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/donovanosis.aspx]. These nodules can bleed easily.

Ultimately, when left untreated, the infection can slowly destroy your genital tissue and spread beyond your genitals to your thighs, your lower abdomen, and other parts of your body. Unless you happen to be Wolverine, this damage may be permanent because such tissue often does not grow back. The prospect of permanent genital damage should be motivation enough to see a doctor, get diagnosed, and get started on antibiotics as soon as possible. Don't assume that you have donovanosis just because you have beefy red lesions or your genitals are being destroyed. Other possible causes of such a situation include necrotizing fasciitis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, anogenital cutaneous amebiasis, cancer, or a belt sander.

In order to diagnose donovanosis, a doctor must scrape the base of your ulcers to obtain a sample of the tissue, stain the tissue sample with Giemsa or Wright's stain, and then observe the sample under a microscope, looking for so-called Donovan bodies. Donovan bodies are the presence of numerous bacteria inside macrophages. Macrophages are cells that exist throughout your body and chomp up invaders like bacteria similar to how Pac-Man will engulf dots and fruit. So Donovan bodies are a sign that you have donovanosis and should begin antibiotic treatment immediately.

Treatment can take a while. It can be a 3-week course of antibiotics such as azithromycin, doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, according to the NLM. Treatment may last even longer if the sores haven't yet completely healed after 3 weeks.

Of course, it is better to avoid getting donovanosis in the 1st place. When people tell you to take risks in life, don't lead with your genitals. Get to know someone before you have sex with him or her. You want to know his or her name and STI history before jumping in the sack. It's better to be straightforward when asking questions. Don't be so subtle that misunderstandings may occur. Once you decide to have sex, make sure you use barrier protection such as condoms. And remember such barrier protection is not like a fashion accessory. It should fit properly and stay on throughout the sexual contact.

It's not completely clear yet whether donovanosis is indeed rising in the UK. While the year 2019 did see a bit of a bump, so to speak, 2020 was too unusual to decipher any trends or lack thereof. This "flesh-eating" STI remains rather rare in the UK as well as in the US, which sees about 100 reported cases each year, according to the NLM. So for now, be aware of donovanosis. After all, it's important to distinguish isolated cases from outbreaks or epidemics. At the same time, you don't want to get caught with your pants down.

[Granuloma inguinale, aka donovanosis, starts as a painless nodule that breaks down into chronic, locally progressive, genital or perineal, often foul-smelling ulcer, usually without regional lymphadenopathy. It is caused by _Klebsiella granulomatis_ (formerly called _Calymmatobacterium granulomatis_), an encapsulated intracellular Gram-negative bacillus that is difficult to culture by conventional bacteriological methods (https://www.microbiologyresearch.org/docserver/fulltext/jmm/48/8/medmicro-48-8-707.pdf?expires=1635273336&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=F33C72ADE4DC65C38189B9576A10227B). It can uncommonly disseminate hematogenously to intra-abdominal organs and bones and is transmitted by direct contact usually during sexual intercourse.

The diagnosis is confirmed by identifying Donovan bodies, which are intracytoplasmic cysts that contain multiple bacilli within mononuclear cells in a tissue smear or crush preparation stained with Giemsa or Wright's stain. PCR testing is also possible. Azithromycin 1 gm orally once weekly or 500 mg daily is given for at least 3 weeks and until all lesions have completely healed (https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment-guidelines/donovanosis.htm). Alternate therapy includes doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day, or erythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 times/day, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one double-strength (160 mg/800 mg) tablet orally 2 times/day; each is given for at least 3 weeks and until all lesions have completely healed.

Granuloma inguinale is endemic in tropical and developing areas, including India, Guyana, New Guinea, northern Australia, and southern Africa. In the mid-1990s, Australia undertook a program to detect, diagnose, and treat granuloma inguinale in the Northern Territory, Queensland, and West Australia in an effort to eradicate the disease. There were initially 115 cases detected within the Aboriginal population in 1995. As of 2004, there were only 5 reported cases of donovanosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1745036/pdf/v081p00365.pdf). See previous posts listed below.

Granuloma inguinale rarely occurs in the United States; about 100 cases are reported each year in the United States. Most of these cases are said to occur in people who have traveled to or are from places where the disease is common (https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000636.htm)
