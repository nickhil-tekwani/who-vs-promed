International epizootic experts and relevant officials from the European
Union (EU), Bulgaria and Greece met in the Bulgarian city of Bourgas on
Wednesday to discuss ways of controlling the animal epidemic of Bluetongue
Disease found in southern Bulgaria.
The meeting called for a 2-year ban on Bulgaria's export of live animals,
which does not include milk and dairy products.
The disease which originated in Africa, spreads through blood contamination
and turns the tongue of an affected animal blue [swollen, and cyanotic. It
normally does not affect human beings but the meat of an affected animal is
inedible.
Bulgaria registered its first ever instance of Bluetongue Disease in the
southeastern Bourgas area last month. Within 3 weeks, the disease spread to
southern regions of Yambol and Haskovo. More than 500 sick sheep have been
killed so far.
Experts fear that the epidemic may spread to neighboring Turkey and Greece,
and then to other European countries.
