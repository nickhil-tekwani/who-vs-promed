The administration of Epidemiological Surveillance of the Secretariat
of Health recently released the 2010 16th [epidemiological week]
dengue epidemiological bulletin. The data show that there was a 53
percent increase in deaths from this disease compared to the same
period of last year [2009]. In that period in 2009 there were 17
patients who died, and in this [year -- 2010] the bulletin now
registers 26 deaths.

The bulletin also shows that the dengue epidemic continues. The data
point to an increase of 325.4 percent [in dengue cases] compared to
the same period last year [2009]. This year, Goias now has registered
75 490 cases. Now 100 cases of DHF have also been registered.

With the 1st case of the mosquito-borne illness dengue fever reported
in the Keys since mid-October [2009], Monroe County health officials
are warning Key West residents to take precautions. The most recent
case, reported in a 41-year-old member of the US Navy, was confirmed
through lab tests in Miami after the man initially sought treatment
from military doctors on 6 Apr [2010]. Officials believe the case was
contracted locally, as the man reported no out-of-country travel in
the past year.

Naval Air Station Key West spokesman Jim Brooks confirmed that the
man, whom officials didn't identify, lived in base housing in Key
West and that "areas where he lived and worked have been tested and
sprayed."

"What we're going to do right now," Monroe County Health Department
spokesman Chris Tittel said, "is continue that push of the public
health message that people need to be aware on a very personal level
of how to deal with mosquitoes." That includes dumping standing water
around homes, screening doors and windows, using air-conditioning
whenever possible and regularly wearing DEET or other repellants.

"We had hoped we'd be able to eliminate the disease from Key West and
took every effort to do so," Health Department administrator Bob
Eadie said. "However, the confirmed case is not totally unexpected in
that once dengue fever has been established in an area, it is truly
almost impossible to completely eradicate it."

An initial outbreak last June [2009] -- the 1st cases documented in
Florida in 40 years -- prompted researchers at the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention dengue lab in Puerto Rico to blood
test some 240 cooperative Old Town residents. The survey found that
99 people tested positive for dengue or associated antibodies.

[3] USA ex Haiti: CDC Health Advisory

Potential for dengue infection among relief workers returning from Haiti
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has received
reports of dengue fever among relief workers returning from Haiti,
where the disease is endemic. Health-care providers in the United
States should consider dengue in the differential diagnosis of
febrile illness in any person who has recently been in Haiti or other
countries where dengue is being transmitted, and are encouraged to
submit samples to state health departments (available from AZ, CA,
CT, FL, NY, PR, and TX) or the CDC for proper laboratory testing. In
US areas with _Aedes_ mosquitoes present, infected travelers may also
present a risk for local spread of dengue virus(es).

[The southeastern states in the USA have more abundant _Ae.
albopictus_ populations, and in the most southern areas _Ae. aegypti_
occurs as well, so the risk of local dengue virus transmission from
imported viremic cases is real.

A 42-year-old housewife from Sungai Siput, Perak became the 55th
victim who died of dengue fever in the 1st 4 months [of 2010], said
deputy health minister Datuk Rosnah Shirlin Abdul Rashid.
"Considering the death toll over a 4-month period, the figure is high
and needs more efforts to prevent further casualties," she told
reporters at the pre-launch of 1Malaysia Health Carnival [in
Putrajaya] today [29 Apr 2010].

Rosnah said though the Health Ministry had carried out 661
Communication For Behavioral Impact (COMBI) programmes this year
[2010], involving 16 563 volunteers, it was not enough. "Awareness
programmes need to be increased to ensure the dengue fever does not
become the country's main killer," said Rosnah.

National Environment Agency (NEA) officers and volunteers from the
Woodlands Community Club's environment committee want Woodlands
residents to wipe pails dry too. They will drill 6-8 holes in the
rims of all pails in 13 000 homes in Woodlands in the next 3 months.
They are targeting pail rims because the number of mosquito-breeding
sites found in pail rims has grown from 4 in 2007 to 47 last year
[2009] in the North West District. Other unusual breeding places
include the base of pails, the rim of dish trays and even the hollow
of frying pans.

Woodlands has already seen 42 cases of dengue fever in the 1st 3
months of the year, exceeding its 40 cases for the whole of last year
[2009]. In contrast, the number of cases in the North West District
fell from 957 in 2008 to 639 last year.

Although the initiative is not a compulsory one, residents are
strongly encouraged to participate as it gives other residents peace
of mind, said Ms Ellen Lee, Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC
[group representation constituency], at the launch of the programme
yesterday [18 Apr 2010]. The Woodlands Environment Committee hopes to
inspire other constituencies in the North West District to follow
suit, said committee chairman Adeline Loh.

A Woodlands resident and nurse, 44, told her maid to wipe water from
flowerpots, pail rims, and pail bases daily, after seeing NEA banners
about the increase in dengue cases in Woodlands in November last year
[2009]. [She] said she is confident of her current preventive
measures, but is willing to participate in the programme. This is
because she lives by the motto of "better safe than sorry," as she
has nursed dengue patients and is fully aware of the dangers of
dengue fever, she said.

[7] Taiwan

The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Monday [26 Apr
2010], 2 more cases of indigenous dengue fever have been reported in
the southern city of Kaohsiung, bringing to 5 the total number of
such cases recorded since the start of the dengue epidemic season in
March [2010]. The latest cases, reported within a week, were
classified as a cluster infection involving 2 people who live 15
meters [50 ft] away from each other in the city's Lingya district,
according to CDC Director-General Ling Ting. The 3 previous cases
also occurred in the port city.

Lin said this year's [2010] dengue fever epidemic pattern is similar
to that of 2002 in that the season started early, which raises
concerns that the outbreak this year could be as bad as it was in
2002. In 2002, a total of 5336 cases of indigenous dengue fever were
recorded. The number included 241 cases of DHF, a potentially fatal
development of the mosquito-borne disease [virus], and 21 deaths.

This year's [2010] epidemic season began in the 11th
[epidemiological] week -- 3 weeks earlier than in 2002, Lin noted.
The interval between the start of the 2010 epidemic season and the
end of the 2009 epidemic season was 4 weeks, which was 2 weeks
shorter than that between 2002 and 2001, he added.

[The Tue 27 Apr 2010 edition of the Taiwan News
(<http://www.etaiwannews.com/etn/news_content.php?id=1237873>)
indicated that the early start of indigenous infections may signal
that the number of local cases will increase this year [2010].

Huang Kao-pin, director of pediatric infectious disease at Chang Gung
Medical Foundation, Kaohsiung Branch, said that theoretically,
indigenous infections shouldn't begin to appear until July or August
and peak in October or November. "It means that some mosquitoes even
carried dengue virus during the winter, which would result in an
early start of the dengue fever outbreak," said Huang, who is also
the director-general of the Taiwan Society of Parasitology. Huang
also said that there may be more people infected by dengue fever
illness this year [2010], and that the possibilities of dengue
hemorrhagic fever infection -- a severe, potentially fatal infection
that is different from normal dengue fever -- will also become higher.

Lin Ting, deputy director of the Taiwan CDC, said that the number of
dengue fever infections will increase when the weather becomes
hotter. Lin suggested the public spend more effort cleaning living
environments to prevent the outbreak of the disease.
