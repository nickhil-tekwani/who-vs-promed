A rare dengue fever-spreading mosquito -- thought to have been eradicated from the [Northern] Territory [NT] in 1969 -- has reappeared in Darwin Harbour.

Between April and December [2013], 5 different invasions were detected between Toll Marine Logistics at Frances Bay and East Arm Wharf.

Yellow fever mosquitoes, or _Aedes aegypti_, were discovered in an insect trap at the Toll Marine Logistics dock on Frances Bay Drive in April, according to a recent bulletin from the Centre for Disease Control (CDC).

And Asian tiger mosquitoes [_Aedes albopictus_] were also found in traps at East Arm Wharf in August, December, and at Toll in August.

_Aedes aegypti_ are normally only found in northern coastal Queensland.

The 1st batch of mosquitoes were thought to have arrived on the international cargo ship Kathryn Bay on 22 Apr [2013].

Mosquito eggs were also discovered in traps the following month but no other specimens were found. The larvae and pupae were thought to have come from a female mosquito from the cargo ship Starbird, which had previously stopped in Gove and Cairns before arriving in Darwin on 9 May [2013].

Traps were set and surveys completed of both boats when the ships were in port.

The port area, including adjoining properties Frances Bay Marine and Paspaley, were sprayed and "fogged" to eradicate mozzies.

Exotic mosquitoes have shown up in the port in the last 12 years, but only once before have as many as 5 incursions been detected. "Increased numbers of incursions are concerning and action should be taken," CDC medical entomologists Nina Kurucz and William Pettit said in the report. The report recommends targeting high-risk cargo with barrier spray. It also called for immediate inspections of risk cargo by the Agriculture Department and inspections on ships coming from Queensland to the Territory.

"(This) once again demonstrated the vulnerability of the Darwin port area as an entry point for exotic mosquito vectors in the NT and the importance of routine vector surveillance and control operations in such areas to keep the NT free of exotic vectors and disease," the report said.

"_Aedes aegypti_ ... pose a real threat to the NT, with the Darwin and other NT port areas particularly vulnerable to the importation of such vectors."

The report also recommended "to minimise the potential for future exotic vector incursions in the NT, a revision of current procedures should be considered."

[_Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ are efficient vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses, hence the concern about them becoming established in the Northern Territory (NT). There have been sporadic dengue outbreaks in northern Queensland state. Since these mosquitoes were detected in Darwin from April to December 2013, and no further mention was made for their presence at a later date, we presume that they were eliminated by the vector control measures that were implemented. This above situation has 2 important lessons: 1) Ongoing surveillance is essential to early detection and rapid response is required for elimination. And 2) these 2 _Aedes_ species are notorious for being disseminated to other localities through human activity, and can easily become established. The above report is correct; these mosquitoes pose a real threat to the NT.
