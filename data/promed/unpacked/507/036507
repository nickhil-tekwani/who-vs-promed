Monkey might be source of Marburg disease outbreak
----------------------------------------------------------
Health experts in Uganda have linked the outbreak of the deadly
Marburg hemorrhagic fever (MHF) in the western part of the country to
a monkey similar to those that were responsible for the 1st outbreak in 1967.
Sam Okware, the head of the national task force to fight the spread
of the epidemic told a news conference here on Friday [3 Aug 2007]
that preliminary investigations showed that the virus may [have been]
passed to one of the 2 victims [only one of whom has been confirmed
as a case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Mod.CP] by a Colobus monkey
which had been slaughtered.
"The probable case who is alive has been identified to have skinned a
Colobus monkey a week prior to falling ill," Okware said flanked by
the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Uganda, George
Melville. "The skin of the monkey has been recovered and is in safe
custody at the Uganda Virus Institute. Samples of the skin have been
sent for further analysis," he added.
The Ugandan government on Wednesday [1 Aug 2007] announced that 2
cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever had been identified at a gold mine
located in Kakasi Forest Reserve, Kamwenge district, 250km [155.34
miles] west of Kampala. One of the 2 miners confirmed to have
contracted the virus died on 14 Jul 2007 and another miner was
recovering after being treated. "The number of cases still remains 2
-- one confirmed who died and one probable who is still alive. Please
note that the situation has not changed since notification of the
outbreak," Okware stated.
He also revealed that the task force is monitoring more than 140
people who are believed to have come into contact with the 2 miners
both in the capital city Kampala and in Kamwege district. "In
Kampala, 46 contacts have been identified. Among these, 8 are close
contacts being relatives of the probable case and the deceased. In
Kamwenge, 100 contacts who are all miners have been identified. Of
the 100, 50 are local miners living in the village, while another 50
are in a camp 200 metres [218.7 yards]from the mine. Of these, 6 are
in very close contact with the probable case, as they participated in
skinning the monkey," Okware said.
The government has set up isolation units at Mulago hospital in
Kampala and Kicheche health center III in Kamwenge. The health
official again urged the public to remain calm and report any
suspected cases to the nearest health unit.
Marburg hemorrhagic fever, like Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a highly
deadly and contagious disease characterized by sudden onset of high
fever and bleeding, resulting into death within a week if untreated.
The virus can be transmitted through close contact with blood and
other body fluids from carriers who have developed clinical symptoms.
It can also be transmitted following exposure to contaminated items,
such as bedding and clothing of the patients.
The virus is named after Marburg, a city in Germany, where the 1st
outbreak occurred in 1967 among laboratory workers doing research on
monkeys imported from Uganda in order to prepare a polio vaccine.
According to the WHO, the last 2 recent outbreaks of Marburg
hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo during
1998-2000 and in Angola during 2004-2005 have claimed 128 and 323
lives, respectively.

[It is well established that Marburgvirus can infect various
species of monkeys and primates, and indeed the virus was originally
transmitted from imported monkeys to humans in laboratories in
Marburg, Germany, and in the former Yugoslavia. It may be that the
virus responsible for the current outbreak in Uganda was transmitted
from the Colobus monkey that was skinned by the miner who became
subsequently a suspected case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever. However,
this is uncertain since it has not been confirmed that the monkey was
infected with Marburg virus. Likewise it has not been confirmed that
the person who skinned the monkey (and who is no longer ill) was
actually suffering from a Marburgvirus infection.
Even if it is confirmed that the monkey and the miner were infected
by Marburgvirus, the ultimate source of the virus remains unknown.
