Arkansas Mumps Outbreak Numbers Still Rising
--------------------------------------------
There are now 4 confirmed cases of mumps and 48 reported cases in Northwest Arkansas, according to the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH).

That brings the total of reported mumps cases to 52.

On Thursday [1 Sep 2016], there were 2 confirmed cases and 37 reported cases of mumps. Meg Mirivel with the ADH said she expects the number to rise.

The "outbreak" began on Wednesday [31 Aug 2016] with 8 reported cases of mumps. The number has since increased by 6 times.

The ADH said there is a concern with potential for exposure because of the Labor Day [5 Sep 2016] holiday weekend travel. The department said it can be weeks before symptoms appear.

Mumps symptoms include fever, headache, muscles aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite. There is no treatment, and symptoms usually resolve themselves within a few weeks. Mumps is usually a mild disease in children, but adults may have more serious disease with complications, according to the ADH.

The current CDC recommendations for MMR vaccination are as follows:

- For children younger than 6 years of age, 1 dose of MMR vaccine or MMRV (measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella) vaccine at age 12-15 months, followed by a 2nd dose of either MMR vaccine or MMRV vaccine at age 4-6 years.

- For children age 7 through 18 years not previously vaccinated, 1 dose of MMR vaccine or MMRV vaccine, followed by a 2nd dose of either MMR vaccine or MMRV vaccine at least 4 weeks after the 1st dose.

- For adults born in 1957 or later and not previously vaccinated, 1 dose of MMR vaccine.

- A 2nd dose of MMR vaccine is recommended for adults born in 1957 or later, who are students in a post-secondary educational institution, work in a health care facility, or plan to travel internationally. The 2nd dose should be administered a minimum of 28 days after the 1st dose.

Northwest Arkansas mumps outbreak spreads into Rogers
-----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of mumps in northwest Arkansas has spread into Rogers [in Benton County, northwest Arkansas].

Rogers School District spokeswoman Ashley Siwiec told reporters Thursday [8 Sep 2016] that at least 2 students likely had mumps.

Arkansas Health Department epidemiologist Dr. Dirk Haselow said there are 76 confirmed or suspected cases of the virus that was 1st found in late August [2016] in Springdale schools [in Washington and Benton counties, northwest Arkansas].

The outbreak is the state's largest since 2010 when 5 cases were confirmed. It's centered in northwest Arkansas, where the Health Department says the opt-out rate for vaccinations exceeds any other area of the state. State law allows parents to claim medical, religious or philosophical exemptions from school vaccination requirements.

Mumps is a viral infection that causes swelling in the salivary glands and cheeks and may include headaches, fatigue, muscle aches and low-grade fevers.

[Mumps virus is an enveloped single-stranded, linear negative-sense RNA virus of the Rubulavirus genus and Paramyxovirus family. Initial signs and symptoms often include fever, muscle pain, headache, and feeling tired. This is then usually followed by painful swelling of one or both parotid glands. Symptoms typically occur 16 to 18 days after exposure and resolve after 7 to 10 days. Symptoms in adults are often more severe than in children. About 1/3rd of people have mild or no symptoms. Complications may include infections of the covering of the brain (15 percent), pancreatitis (4 percent), permanent deafness, and painful testicular swelling which uncommonly results in infertility.

Mumps can be prevented with MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine. MMR vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease. Two doses of the vaccine are 88 percent (range: 66-95 percent) effective at preventing mumps; one dose is 78 percent (range: 49-92 percent) effective.
