The Paraguayan Health Ministry reported today [14 Nov 2013] that 80 cases of canine leishmaniasis had been detected in humans, more than what was reported last year [2012].

The Health Surveillance Department warned about this unusual increase and the dangers it brings about in a nation with a large population of both pets and stray dogs.

The National Anti-Rabies Centre announced a rapid deployment to control the disease in several departments, to detect potential breeding grounds and prevent it from spreading.

Efforts to control the disease are being carried out in Caacupe, where thousands of pilgrims will gather soon to participate in annual religious festivals.

Access to very expensive drugs for treatment in human beings and the current crisis of local hospitals make the situation more difficult for almost all patients who cannot afford the treatment.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a serious disease caused by a parasite that lives in the blood and internal organs and is transmitted by dogs.

[The WHO states: "Leishmaniasis is a poverty-related disease. It affects the poorest of the poor and is associated with malnutrition, displacement, poor housing, illiteracy, gender discrimination, weakness of the immune system and lack of resources" (http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/burden/en/).

ProMED last reported on leishmaniasis in Paraguay in 2010 (see below) where Dr Julio Manzur, director of the Vector-Borne Diseases Control Service (SENEPA) warned that "leishmaniasis is a silent epidemic disease." 81 cases of visceral leishmaniasis were reported from 2009, which when compared to the present data indicates that the situation is stable.
