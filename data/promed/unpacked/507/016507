Anthrax infected patients are being identified in south of country
------------------------------------------------------------
New patients with anthrax are being registered in Kyrgyzstan.
Recently, a 36-year-old habitant of Aksiskiy [Aksy district] region
of the Jalal-Abad oblast has been hospitalized on suspicion of skin
anthrax. He is the 45th patient with anthrax in the south of the
country and 47th in all Kyrgyzstan this year [2008]. One patient has
died and dozens are under medical supervision.

The alarming epizootic situation in Kyrgyzstan, especially in the
southern regions of country, was the reason to call a multiagency
meeting in Bishkek. Leading specialists of several agencies stated
that the current problems are the result of neglect by officials of
their duties in many agencies, lack of security measures, and
indifference of people towards their health.

The head sanitary doctor of the republic, Sabirjan Abdilarimov,
listed several delinquencies: for example, vaccines in the Naukatskoe
[Naukat district] region [of Osh oblast] were kept in a cellar at 20
deg C (68 deg F); in some cases an unknown liquid was used as a
solvent for the vaccine; and single-use syringes were used several times.

There has been much criticism of the fact that after the appearance
of suspected anthrax, measures have been taken only after 15 days.
Burial of dead animals is not perfect and safety measures are not
being implemented. In addition, a large problem is soil niduses of
anthrax. There are 245 of those in the Osh oblast and 353 in
Jalal-Abad. Many dangerous areas are swept by flooding and
landslides. Many infected areas are uncontrolled, as in the
Nookenskoe [Nooken district] region of Jalal-Abad oblast, where only
3 out of 50 burial sites are covered by concrete.

[The above situation as reported in the newswire is an effort on the
part of the public health community to identify the shortcomings in
programmatic areas that have led to the continued occurrence of both
human as well as veterinary cases of anthrax. The impact of these
deficiencies is seen in the multiple reports of disease occurrence as
seen in the prior ProMED-mail postings referenced in the see also
section below. - Mod.MPP]
