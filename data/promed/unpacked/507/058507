The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] announced on Friday [2 Aug 2013] that a multi-state hepatitis A outbreak was traced back to a common shipment of pomegranate seeds from a company in Turkey. Pomegranate seeds from Goknur Foodstuffs Import Export Trading were used by the US company Townsend Farms, Inc., to make Townsend Farms Organic Antioxidant Blend, a product sold from Costco markets. As of Thursday [1 Aug 2013], 10 states reported 158 total cases of hepatitis A after eating the product. While all ill people who reported eating the product bought the antioxidant blend from Costco markets, the product was also sold at Harris Teeter stores. There were no ill people identified who bought the product from Harris Teeter.

The CDC and the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] determined the major outbreak strain of hepatitis A virus belonged to genotype 1B, which is rarely seen in the Americas but is found in North Africa and the Middle East. The genotype was identified in a 2013 outbreak of hepatitis A virus infections in Europe connected with frozen berries and a 2012 British Columbia outbreak linked to a frozen berry blend with pomegranate seeds from Egypt. There is no evidence that the outbreaks are related to the ongoing US outbreak.

In June [2013], Townsend Farms and another company, Scenic Fruit Company, recalled certain product lots because of potential hepatitis A virus contamination. The FDA is working with the firms that distributed pomegranate seeds from the shipment from Turkey to make sure all seed recipients are notified.

Interim audit of hepatitis A enhanced surveillance data
-------------------------------------------------------
Following the increase in the number of non-travel related HAV [hepatitis A virus] cases sent to the Virus Reference Department for HAV RNA testing and genotyping and HAV contaminated sundried tomatoes causing outbreaks world wide in recent years, enhanced surveillance of HAV was launched in January 2013 to try and better understand the molecular epidemiology of HAV. To date [9 Aug 2013], 208 samples have been received for HAV RNA testing; 60 through enhanced surveillance, 125 through routine diagnostic testing and 23 through both enhanced surveillance and diagnostic testing.

A total of 76 of the samples had no detectable HAV RNA; 132 samples had detectable HAV RNA, all of which could be genotyped except one; 41 were genotype IA (31.1 percent), 45 were genotype IB (34.1 percent) and 45 were genotype IIIA (34.1 percent). Of these cases, 50 had travelled (37.9 percent), 71 had not travelled (53.8 percent) and 11 had no information (8.3 percent). The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 78 years of age with travel associated HAV only being more common than non-travel associated HAV in one age range, 5-9 years.

Age distribution of HAV cases
-----------------------------
Non-travel related cases account of 85 percent of the IA sequences. Genotype IA has been implicated in an Italian outbreak; this sequence has not been seen in any cases from England but has been seen in 12 cases in Ireland, 9 of whom had no travel history.

Non-travel related cases account of 66.7 percent of the IB sequences. A total of 3 different strains of genotype IB have been implicated in recent international outbreaks: one linked to frozen berries in 4 Nordic countries, one linked to frozen berries in the USA and one linked to travel to Egypt. Neither of the strains associated with frozen berries have been observed in England but 8 cases that travelled to Egypt were found to have the strain associated with the recent outbreak. The majority of cases with travel history had visited Egypt (73.3 percent). A unique genotype IB sequence has been implicated in an outbreak affecting patients in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland.

Travel related cases account of 66.7 percent of the IIIA sequences. The majority of cases with travel history had visited Pakistan (80 percent). No international outbreaks have been associated with genotype IIIA.

It is clear that there are significant numbers of non-travel associated HAV cases and typing of cases from known countries increases our ability to determine origin of these strains.

[Genotyping of outbreak strains of hepatitis A virus infection is helping to identify routes of transmission of hepatitis A virus infection. Travel related cases accounted for 66.7 percent of the IIIA sequences. Genotype IA has been implicated in an Italian outbreak, a genotype that has not been seen in the UK. A hepatitis IB strain was responsible for the multi-state outbreak in the USA referred to in part [1] above. In recent outbreaks, 3 different strains of genotype IB have been implicated: one linked to frozen berries in 4 Nordic countries, one linked to frozen berries in the USA, and one linked to travel to Egypt. Travel related cases in the UK account of 66.7 percent of the IIIA sequences. The majority were linked with travel to Pakistan, where genotype IIIA is uniquely prevalent. Accumulation of such data will help to elucidate the epidemiology of hepatitis A virus infection and facilitate the control of infection by targeted vaccination. - Mod.CP]
