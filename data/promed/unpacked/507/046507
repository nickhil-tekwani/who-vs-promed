Re: oily spot disease of pomegranate
------------------------------------
Bacterial blight of pomegranate caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_
pv. _punicae_ has become an increasingly serious threat for
pomegranate growers of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka
states of the Indian subcontinent. The disease is most severe in
Nashik and Solapur [Maharashtra] with a range of 70 to 80 percent
incidence. Cloudy weather and intermittent rainfall are favouring
disease initiation and further spread of the disease.

We have developed a chemical formulation (liquid), which has the
potential to kill _X. axonopodis_. A complete inhibition of bacterial
colonies was observed in laboratory experiments. Now we are
interested in testing the formulation in the field directly.

It is my request to the scientists and farmers that they test this
formulation in the field, and help us in this context to minimise the
problem of oily spot disease in pomegranate. Please e-mail me.

[Oily spot of pomegranate (also called bacterial blight, black spot)
is caused by the bacterium _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar
_punicae_. The main damage is observed on fruits, which develop black
spots and usually split resulting in enormous yield losses. For
example, during surveys conducted in 2006/2007 in Maharashtra (the
state with the largest pomegranate production in India) by the
National Research Centre on Pomegranate, oily spot was found to be
the main disease with 100 percent infection in some orchards.

The pathogen is spread by infected plant material (including fruit
and cuttings), mechanical means, and wind-splashed rain. Heavy rains
are thought to be a triggering factor for previous epidemics in
India. No commercial pomegranate cultivar has been found to show any
resistance to oily spot. Disease management includes use of clean
planting material, phytosanitary measures, and bactericidal sprays
containing antibiotics or copper. However, the latter may lead to
rejection of exported fruit by some countries.

Another strain of the same species, _X. axonopodis_ pv. _citri_,
causes citrus canker, a disease that poses a serious economic threat
to citrus industries worldwide.

We thank Dr Laware for this promising report and are very happy to
pass on the request to potential collaborators to contact him
directly regarding the field testing of his chemicals. ProMED-plant
hopes to be able to report on the progress of this research in the
future.
