Sheep with scrapie found in Japan
----------------------------------
A female sheep in Hokkaido has been found infected with scrapie, a
fatal, degenerative nerve disease affecting sheep and goats, local
officials said Saturday.
It is the first time in 2 years a sheep has been discovered infected
with the disease in Japan, and the latest case is the 60th of its
kind since the first was discovered in Japan in 1984, they said.
