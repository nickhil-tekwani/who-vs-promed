MALARIA - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: REQUEST FOR INFO
**********************************************
Date: Mon, 7 Jul 1997 15:32:00 +0100
From: Norman MacDonald <normanm@scieh.tcom.co.uk>

The British press (particularly the Sunday Times) has been carrying reports
over the weekend of a dramatic rise in cases of malaria in the Dominican
Republic. Can anyone confirm this in any detail?
