[1] Pakistan (Sindh), 1 new WPV1 case - media report
Date: 6 Dec 2017

The city witnessed its 2nd case of polio within a span of 3 months, the latest victim being a 5-month-old infant who has been diagnosed with the virus.

A 5-month-old boy, a resident of UC-4 Gadap Town, had been administered with anti-polio drops during a past campaign. However, his routine immunisation had not been completed, officials said.

Just over 3 months ago, the metropolis reported its 1st polio case after staying polio-free for 18 months, an alarming recurrence despite the efforts that were being made to eradicate the crippling disease from the country.

[A 7-month-old boy], a resident of Village Sher Khan/Madina Colony in UC 13 Gulshan, was confirmed as the victim of polio in September [2017]. The infant's grandfather had reportedly refused the administration of polio drops at [his] birth.

In all, 6 cases of polio have been reported in the country this year [2017].

Three years ago, Karachi was known as the largest reservoir of polio in the world, with as many as 23 new cases being reported annually. The efforts of the Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) for polio in Sindh have been credited with helping contain the outbreak through innovative strategies such as hiring educated female workers. These strategies in the fight against polio have been acclaimed by the international community as well.

EOC appeals to the public, the media, influencers, and everyone who can help raise awareness about the re-emergence of polio in the city to make parents stop playing with their children's futures and to help eradicate polio completely, which is only possible through multiple immunisations.

[The identification of a case of polio in Karachi (Sindh province) is not a total surprise, as reviewing the weekly updates from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, all weeks from September 2017 through the latter half of November 2017, have reported positive environmental samples from Sindh province, suggesting that the poliovirus was circulating in the province. Of note is that the 1st case reported from Karachi had a date of onset of paralysis on 11 Aug 2017.

Borrowing from my colleague Mod.SN's comment in the ProMED-SoAs post on this case (still pending archiving), "In October 2017, 16 percent of the environmental samples in Pakistan, the largest polio environmental footprint in the world, tested positive for polio virus (http://www.endpolio.com.pk/images/polio-briefer/Pakistan-Polio-Update-OCTOBER-2017.pdf). The highest proportion of polio positive environmental samples were reported in Islamabad followed by Balochistan. A total of 19 districts across the country are known to be infected with polio by cases or positive environmental samples."

[2] Syria, no new cases - WHO/UNICEF SitRep No. 25, 6 Dec 2017
Date: 6 Dec 2017

Key highlights
- No new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week. The most recent case (by date of onset) is [9 Sep 2017] from Mayadeen district.
- The total number of confirmed cVDPV2 cases remains 70.
- Planning continues for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response. The Syrian Ministry of Health has requested additional doses of mOPV2 and IPV for 2 further immunization rounds.
- Training of health staff for the assessment of cold chain capacity across the country is ongoing in Damascus. Health staff have been trained on mobile data collection. All accessible health facilities will be assessed starting [10 Dec 2017].

Risk mitigation strategies
- Planning continues for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response, and for this purpose, additional doses of mOPV2 and IPV have been requested by the Syrian Ministry of Health.
- Microplanning in preparation for the planned activities is ongoing to ensure population movements in parts of Deir Ez-Zor are accounted for. During the recent bOPV-IPV sub-national campaign, teams mapped populations, roads for transporting vaccines, and identified centres for vaccine distribution.
- 25 cold boxes and additional fridges and generators will be provided to address gaps in the cold chain. Qamishli will act as the main cold room providing frozen ice packs to support planned activities.
- Training of health staff for the assessment of cold chain capacity across the country is ongoing in Damascus. Health staff have been trained on mobile data collection. All accessible health facilities will be assessed starting [10 Dec 2017].
- Activities to strengthen AFP surveillance are ongoing. Contact sampling from all AFP cases continues and stool samples are being taken from healthy children arriving from known infected areas as well as from silent districts (districts that have not reported AFP cases in 2017). In addition, physicians operating in camps in Raqqa and Hasakah governorates have been sensitized on reporting of AFP cases.

Surveillance summary
- In 2017, Syria and all governorates but 4 are meeting both key indicators for AFP surveillance: 3* or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years of age, and 80 percent or above AFP cases with adequate specimens. Deir Ez-Zor (78%), Raqqa (71%), Rural Damascus (76%) and Swieda (63%) are missing the 80% target for stool adequacy. (*NB: In an outbreak setting, the target is 3 or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years).
- The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 146 (107 from Mayadeen, 13 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 26 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 23 AFP cases (10 from Raqqa, 11 from Tell Abyad, and 2 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 46 AFP cases (23 from Homs city, 20 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts).
- Five poliovirus type-2 isolates are pending genomic sequencing.

[While no new cases have been reported in this current SitRep update, there are still 5 poliovirus 2 isolates pending genomic sequencing that are probably cVDPV2.

There's an excellent map of the locations of each of the reported cases in this outbreak available at the source URL.
