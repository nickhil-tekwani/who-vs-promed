The regional veterinary office [in Rosh-Pinna, a unit of Israel's State Veterinary Field Services] has begun sampling of sera from cattle herds on the Golan Heights, for serological surveillance addressing leptospirosis. Preliminary results are indicative of high infection rate in the Yehudiya beef herd. Vaccination against leptospirosis in this herd has commenced.

[Since 2011, vaccination of Israel's beef cattle herds against leptospirosis has been privatized. During the 5 years preceding 2011, namely 2006-2010, the mean annual number of beef cattle vaccinations, in the Upper Galilee and the Golan heights, as performed by the State Veterinary Service (VSAH) personnel, was around 4000 (about 25 percent of the total beef cattle population in the region).The (killed) vaccine used was monovalent _L. hardjo_.

Following the privatization, no data on cattle vaccinations against leptospirosis have become anymore available. Leptpspirosis in animals is a notifiable disease in Israel. It is not included in OIE's list.

After the 2011 privatization, a considerable part of cattle vaccinations, previously performed by State personnel, has been taken over by the practitioners of 'Hachaklait' cooperative for clinical veterinary services.

In response to ProMED-mail's request we received from Hachaklait's Head veterinarian, Dr Gabi Kenigswald, the following information:

"The 1st beef cattle herd indicated by VSAH to be vaccinated is the round 1100-head herd in Yehudiya (map at https://tinyurl.com/ya3d6rlr), which was found extensively infected by serological tests and some clinical signs (abortions). The applied (killed) vaccine is pentavalent, including the leptospira serovars pomona, hardjo, grippotyphosa, canicola and icterohaemorrhagiae. All ages are to be vaccinated. Though booster vaccination is not prescribed by the producer, such vaccination, 6-8 weeks after the initial vaccination, is being considered. The entire herd is planned to undergo a single annual vaccination each future year, while young calves are to be vaccinated at the age of 6 and 12 weeks. Similar vaccination regime is to be soon undertaken in another beef herd in the region, in Gonen, where abortions have been recorded. Vaccination of additional herds in the Golan will be applied if/when permitted by the VSAH."

According to the Ministry of Health, as cited by YNet News on [Mon 27 Aug 2018], 42 people have so far been diagnosed with leptospirosis while 462 presented symptoms of the disease. Swimming is still prohibited in the following parks: Zaki Stream, Yehudiya, Meshushim stream, the Majrasa estuary, the Jilabun Stream, the Arik Bridge in the Jordan River, and the Abukayak site (https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5335802,00.html).

While _L. Pomona_ remains the main suspect of the event, final identification of the serovar involved by the investigating national reference laboratory at Ness Ziona is yet to be completed/published.

For additional information on an earlier (2017) _L. pomona_ event in Israel's cattle and its background, please refer to post 20170202.4811833.

The identity of the serovar, as well as the results of the serosurveillance currently performed by the Field Veterinary Services and the Kimron Veterinary Institute in grazing beef cattle in the affected region, are anticipated as soon as completed. - Mod.AS
