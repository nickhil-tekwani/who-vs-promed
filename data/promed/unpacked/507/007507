On 10 Aug 2019, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of a confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse located in the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. The unvaccinated mare was euthanized following the sudden onset and progression of neurological signs. Laboratory diagnostic testing confirmed infection with the EEE virus (EEEv).

EEE is not transmissible from horses to people. Effective equine vaccines for EEE are available, and veterinarians should encourage clients to keep their horse's vaccinations current. Once clinical infection develops, treatment options are limited to supportive care. The mortality rate in unvaccinated horses is high.

Veterinarians in Ontario should consider EEE as a differential diagnosis in horses exhibiting neurological signs and can identify positive cases through appropriate testing. IgM antibodies to the EEEv can be detected in serum from horses with neurological signs.

Clinical signs of EEE, including circling, head-pressing, ataxia and depression, can mimic a variety of encephalitides, including rabies, West Nile virus (WNV), botulism, hepatic encephalopathy, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy. Most equine cases of EEE in Ontario occur between the months of August and October and end with the onset of frost.

EEEv affects mainly equine species in eastern North America but can rarely cause severe disease in humans. EEEv has also caused fatal infections in pheasants, quail, emus, alpacas, llamas and dogs. EEEv has been reported in horses in Ontario since 1938. Equine neurological cases are posted on the OMAFRA website.

Ontario's local public health units are conducting mosquito surveillance for both WNV and EEEv. Birds are the natural hosts for both viruses, which are transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes that have bitten an infected bird. As of 7 Aug 2019, no mosquito pools have tested positive for EEEv.

Questions about EEE in horses can be directed to [the] Ontario Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

Louisiana Department of Agriculture issued the following announcement on 19 Aug 2019. A total of 16 horses have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) since 5 Jun 2019. Department of Agriculture and Forestry commissioner Mike Strain, DVM, is reminding horse owners to vaccinate their animals for both EEE and West Nile virus (WNV). "It's been a wet season and we are seeing an unusually high number of cases at this time," said Strain. Horses are infected the same way humans are infected -- by being bitten by infected mosquitoes -- so everyone needs to take extra precautionary measures at this time."

If a mosquito bites an infected bird, EEE or WNV can be spread to horses, dogs, cats and humans. These mosquito-transmitted diseases can cause inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. Clinical signs can include fever, loss of appetite, weakness and loss of coordination. The disease can often result in death.

EEE primarily causes disease in the equine species such as horses, mules, donkeys and zebras. However, a number of other animals such as pigs, llamas, bats, reptiles, amphibians, and rodents can also be infected.

Prevention includes removing standing water where mosquitos breed and using mosquito repellants that are safe for animals and humans. Horses can also be vaccinated. So far, there is no vaccination approved for people. Horse owners should contact their local veterinarian regarding proper vaccination protocols during this time of increased risk.

Veterinarians are required to call the Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry if they suspect EEE or WNV in a horse, as they are reportable diseases.

Veterinarians humanely euthanized a yearling filly of unidentified breed on 13 Aug 2019 after she developed clinical signs of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) on 10 Aug 2019. Signs included ataxia (incoordination), blindness, and dullness. Diagnostic samples obtained from the mare confirmed her positive for EEE on 15 Aug 2019.

According to the New York State Department of Agriculture, the mare, located in West Monroe, Oswego County, New York, had been vaccinated. [One has to wonder as a filly, how many of the vaccines she had received? How was the vaccine handled? Was it allowed to get hot? Was the filly immunosuppressed? More questions than answers regarding a vaccinated horse succumbing to this disease. - Mod.TG]

Eastern equine encephalomyelitis is caused by the EEE virus, for which wild birds are a natural reservoir. Mosquitoes that feed on EEE-infected birds can transmit the virus to humans, horses, and other birds. Horses do not develop high enough levels of these viruses in their blood to be contagious to other animals or humans. Because of the high mortality rate in horses and humans, EEE is regarded as one of the most serious mosquitoborne diseases in the USA.

Tips for preventing mosquito-borne diseases include the following:
- avoid mosquito bites: use insect repellent when outdoors, especially from dusk to dawn;
- look for EPA-labeled products containing active ingredients such as DEET, picaridin (KBR3023), or oil of lemon eucalyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol);
- apply more repellent, according to label instructions, if mosquitoes start to bite;
- mosquito-proof homes: fix or install window and door screens, and cover or eliminate empty containers with standing water where mosquitoes can lay eggs;
- protect your horses: veterinarians recommend commercially available licensed vaccines against EEE for all horses in the USA. Horses should be vaccinated at least annually (recommendations vary in high-risk areas). It's not too late this year to vaccinate your horses;
- use approved insect repellents to protect horses;
- if possible, put horses in stables, stalls, or barns during the prime mosquito exposure hours of dusk and dawn;
- eliminate standing water, drain water troughs, and empty buckets at least weekly;
- stock water tanks with fish that consume mosquito larvae (contact your local mosquito control for assistance), or use mosquito "dunks" (solid "donuts" of _Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis_ [BTi], which are nontoxic to horses) available at hardware stores.

[It should be remembered this virus is transmitted by mosquitoes, and humans are susceptible to the bite of the mosquito as well as many of the diseases a mosquito can transmit.

Please use horse-approved sprays on your horse; spray yourself with an appropriate mosquito repellent; and VACCINATE your horse. One vaccine for the horse generally covers EEE, western EE, West Nile virus and usually tetanus. This is generally one injection followed about 3 weeks later by a 2nd injection. A lot of protection for your animal, and more peace of mind for you. - Mod.TG
