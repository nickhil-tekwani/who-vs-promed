Egypt: 2 new human cases of bird flu in Al Gharbiyah
-----------------------------------------------
Two Egyptians were taken to hospital after testing positive for the
H5N1 strain of avian influenza in the central Nile delta region, the
Health Ministry said. These latest cases bring to 17 the total number
of Egyptians infected, including 7 who were killed by the virus.
The two Egyptians from the village of Hanut in the Gharbiya
governorate contracted the disease after coming into contact with
infected ducks they had been rearing in their homes, according to a
ministry statement carried by the official MENA agency. All the birds
in the house and in neighboring homes were slaughtered and the area
disinfected, MENA said.
Egypt -- the Arab world's most populous state -- is on a major route
for migratory birds and has seen the 3rd highest number of H5N1 cases
after Indonesia and China, according to Dr. David Nabarro, the UN
official charged with battling bird flu. The H5N1 strain of bird flu
was 1st diagnosed in birds in Egypt in February 2006, and the 1st
case in humans was announced on 18 Mar 2006.

development, being the 1st human cases to be reported in Egypt since
the end of September 2006. They raise the global total of avian
influenza cases to 260 and the human death toll to 154.
The village of Hanut is in the governorate (province) of Al
Gharbiyah, which lies to the north of Cairo in the Nile Delta: See
