Bird flu has killed at least 30 swans from Queen Elizabeth's flock, with more expected to succumb to the disease, UK officials say.

"We are currently at the river recovering bodies of the dead swans," said David Barber, the official responsible for the Queen's swans. "This is the 1st time in my 24 years as Swan Marker that bird flu has hit the Thames -- naturally, we are all very upset about the situation."

An alert was initially sent to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) by Swan Support, a rehabilitation center, after they noticed several of the animals near the Queen's residence at Windsor Castle, west of London, appeared to be ill.

"We found a few dead swans, but we find dead swans all year round," Wendy Hurmon, director of operations at Swan Support, told CNN. "But then we noticed that some of the other swans did not look very well and we thought 'something is not right here.'"

After 7 swans died in the Queen's flock, which is actually called a bevy, their remains were analyzed and 5 were confirmed to have the disease, DEFRA said.

On 18 Jan 2016, DEFRA introduced an Avian Flu Prevention Zone that makes it a legal requirement for anyone who keeps a bird to follow strict protocol and advice to prevent the spread of the disease.

"We are continuing to see cases of bird flu in wild birds across the country which is why, if you keep birds, it is absolutely essential that you do all you can to protect them and help prevent the spread of the disease," UK Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said in a statement.

scientists said the risk of human-to-human transmission is low.

Barber confirmed to CNN that the outbreak is unlikely to affect the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in Windsor in May [2018].

[According to the UK government's last available update, date 1 Feb 2018, during January 2018, HPAI H5N6 was identified as cause of disease and death of wild birds in the following counties of England: Warwickshire, Hertfordshire, West Yorkshire, Rutland, and Greater London. This involved a total of 75 birds of the following species: mute swan, pochard, Canada goose, great crested grebe, gulls (common, great black-backed, herring), greylag goose, ducks (Aylesbury; tufted; mallard), moorhen and 19 unspecified. See further details at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/avian-influenza-in-wild-birds.

Most likely, the queen's swans at Windsor have suffered infection by the same (HPAI H5N6) virus strain; final lab results are awaited. - Mod.AS
