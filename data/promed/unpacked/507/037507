Danish authorities have reported the country's 1st case of H5 bird flu
virus in poultry. The virus was found in a petting farm in Hundslev, on Fyn
island in the centre of the country. [Map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/DA/4/Hundslev.html>]. All the birds have
been destroyed, the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (DFVA) said.
Authorities have set up a 3 km protection zone and a 10 km observation area
round where the infected birds were found.
Denmark has reported a number of cases of the most virulent H5N1 strain of
bird flu in wild birds, but this is the first time the Scandinavian country
has reported the H5 virus in poultry.
The H5N1 substrain of H5, in its most aggressive form, has killed more than
100 people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.

Denmark halts poultry exports from Funen island
-----------------------------------------------
COPENHAGEN: Denmark has halted exports of poultry from Funen after birds on
a smallholding farm on the Danish island tested positive for the H5 strain
of avian flu, the Danish Ministry of Consumer Affairs said on Thursday.
The ministry said that the outbreak may also force Denmark to halt all its
poultry exports, not just those from the island. The birds have been culled
and police have cordoned off an area of 3 km around the farm, the
administration said in a statement.
This is Denmark's first case of H5 bird flu in domestic birds, but the
deadly H5N1 strain has already been found in several wild birds.
Denmark found its first case of H5N1 bird flu in a wild buzzard south of
Copenhagen in March and since then has tested more than 1000 birds with at
least 25 testing positive for the highly pathogenic virus strain.
Denmark produces about 136 million chickens annually, or about 3 billion
Danish crown's worth, with about two-thirds going to export.

[During the first 4 months of 2006, 982 dead wild birds from Denmark were
tested for the presence of avian influenza at the Danish Veterinary and
Food Research Institute.
Many different bird species have been examined. The birds have been grouped
into the following categories:
- predatory birds (buzzards, eagles, falcons, hawks, and owls)
- swans
- ducks
- other swimming birds
- Gglls and terns
- crow birds
- other birds.
Since 14 Mar 2006, they detected 43 infected wild birds, most of them (26)
in Funen county (in Danish, Fyns Amt). The infected birds in Funen were: 16
tufted ducks (_Aythya fuligula_), 2 mute swans (_Cygnus olor_), 2 common
buzzards (_Buteo buteo_), one peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_) and one
Greylag goose (_Anser anser_).
For further details of the Danish surveillance, including a map and a
histogram showing the number of birds that have been tested/found positive
in each category, go to

Denmark has made an impressive effort to prevent H5N1 from infecting
domestic fowl, in spite of the proven presence of infection in wild birds
for more than 2 months. As seen already in Germany and France, it is
extremely difficult to hermetically seal off domestic fowl from any contact
with wildlife in order to prevent single outbreaks. - Mod.AS]
