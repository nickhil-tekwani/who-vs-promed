Cases of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in cattle have been reported in Limpopo's
Vhembe district [map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/south_africa_pol_2005.jpg>].
According to the manager of veterinary services in Vhembe, Dr Tambudzani
Rhangani, the disease, which is also known as the Neethling virus, is
spread among cattle by insects and flies that multiply during the rainy season.

A large outbreak was also reported in Zimbabwe and the Limpopo Valley
recently. The disease does not affect people.

"It is a very sporadic disease which comes seasonally and can be treated
with vaccines and antibiotics," said Dr Rhangani. He said cattle farmers
need not be very concerned, as the spread of the disease is largely
dependent on the movement of the cattle, however they should take the
necessary precautions.

The Transvaal Agricultural Union of South Africa said cattle vaccinations
should be a standard annual practice for all cattle farmers in early summer.

Chairperson of the union's northern branch, Dries Joubert, said that
although the mortality rate is usually very low, the disease could lead to
lower milk production, terminated pregnancies and extensive damage to the
cattle hides.

Cattle farmers who have not yet vaccinated their livestock are advised to
do so immediately. Vaccines can be obtained from the Onderstepoort
Veterinary Institute research laboratory outside Pretoria.

[The following overview on LSD is derived from chapter 2.1.7. of the Office
International des Epizooties' Manual of diagnostic tests and vaccines for
terrestrial animals (updated 23 Jul 2004), with slight modifications,
particularly on its geographical distribution since 2004:

"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) was 1st seen in Zambia in 1929, spreading into
Botswana by 1943, and then into South Africa, where it affected over 8
million cattle causing major economic loss. In 1957, it entered Kenya,
associated with an outbreak of sheep pox. In 1970, LSD spread north into
the Sudan; by 1974, it had spread west as far as Nigeria, and in 1977 was
reported from Mauritania, Mali, Ghana and Liberia. Another epizootic of LSD
between 1981 and 1986 affected Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Somalia and the
Cameroon, with reported mortality rates in affected cattle of 20 per cent.
However, the true extent of this epizootic was not clear, and it probably
affected a considerable area of central Africa. LSD must be considered to
have the potential to become established outside Africa. In 1988, LSD was
identified and subsequently became established in Egypt, and in 1989, a
single outbreak was reported in southwestern Israel, which neighbours
Egypt. The Israeli outbreak, involving 14 out of 17 dairy farm units in one
village, was successfully eradicated by the stamping out of the entire
cattle population of the affected village. In 1993, LSD was diagnosed in
the Gaza strip, vaccination was applied, and the disease did not spread to
Israel. However, in June 2006, LSD was diagnosed in Israeli dairy cattle
farms adjacent to the Gaza strip. Modified stamping out was applied;
outbreaks continued throughout 2007, all of them around the Gaza strip. The
disease seems to have become endemic within the Gaza strip, most probably
originating in Egypt.

"The principal method of LSD transmission is mechanical by arthropod vector.

"The severity of clinical signs of LSD, (Neethling or knopvelsiekte),
depends on the strain of capripoxvirus and the breed of host. _Bos taurus_
(such as European dairy cattle breeds) is more susceptible to clinical
disease than _Bos indicus_ (such as Zebu beef cattle); the Asian buffalo
has also been reported to be susceptible. Within _Bos taurus_, the
fine-skinned Channel Island breeds develop more severe disease, with
lactating cows appearing to be the most at risk. However, even among groups
of cattle of the same breed kept together under the same conditions, there
is a large variation in the clinical signs presented, ranging from
subclinical infection to death. There may be failure of the virus to infect
the whole group, depending on vector prevalence.

"In the acutely infected animal, there is an initial pyrexia, which may
exceed 41 C and persist for one week. The incubation period under field
conditions has not been reported, but following inoculation is 6-9 days
until the onset of fever. A rhinitis and conjunctivitis develop, and in
lactating cattle, there is a marked reduction in milk yield. Nodules of 2-5
cm in diameter develop over the body, particularly on the head, neck, udder
and perineum. These nodules involve the dermis and epidermis and may
initially exude serum, but over the following 2 weeks may become necrotic
plugs that penetrate the full thickness of the hide. All the superficial
lymph nodes are enlarged, the limbs may be edematous, and the animal is
reluctant to move. The nodules on the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose,
mouth, rectum, udder and genitalia quickly ulcerate, and by then, all
secretions contain LSD virus. On the appearance of clinical signs, the
discharge from the eyes and nose becomes mucopurulent, and keratitis may
develop. Nodules may also develop in the mouth, subcutis and muscle, in the
trachea and alimentary tract, particularly the abomasum, and in the lungs,
resulting in primary and secondary pneumonia. Pregnant cattle may abort,
and there are reports of aborted fetuses being covered in nodules. Bulls
may become permanently or temporarily infertile. Recovery from severe
infection is slow; the animal is emaciated, may have pneumonia and
mastitis, and the necrotic plugs of skin, which may have been subject to
fly strike, are shed leaving deep holes in the hide.

"LSD virus is not transmissible to humans."

The manual further describes LSD vaccines as follows:

"Two live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus have been used as vaccines
specifically for the control of LSD: a strain of Kenya sheep and goat pox
virus passaged 18 times in LT or fetal calf muscle cells, and a strain from
South Africa, passaged 60 times in lamb kidney cells and 20 times on the
chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated chicken eggs. All strains of
capripoxvirus examined so far, whether of bovine, ovine or caprine origin,
share a major neutralising site, so that animals recovered from infection
with one strain are resistant to infection with any other strain.
Consequently, it is possible to protect cattle against LSD using strains of
capripoxvirus derived from sheep or goats. In 1989 and 1990, the Romanian
strain of sheep pox vaccine was used to help control the LSD outbreak in
Egypt. However, it is essential to carry out controlled trials,
particularly using the most susceptible breeds in peak lactation, prior to
introducing a vaccine strain not usually used in cattle. Protection
following vaccination is probably lifelong, although as immunity wanes,
local capripoxvirus replication will occur at the site of inoculation, but
the virus will not become generalised. Both strains of capripoxvirus used
routinely as vaccines can produce a large local reaction at the site of
inoculation in _Bos taurus_ breeds, which some stock owners find
unacceptable. This has discouraged the use of vaccine even though the
consequences of an outbreak of LSD are invariably more severe.

"A new generation of capripox vaccines is being developed that uses the
capripoxvirus genome as a vector for the genes of other ruminant pathogens,
for instance genes of rinderpest and peste des petits ruminants viruses.
The recombinant vaccine will provide protection against LSD and rinderpest
in a single vaccination."

According to experience gathered in Israel, the application of live
modified Kenyan sheep and goat pox vaccine strain (SGP0240) in dairy cattle
(Holstein-Israeli dairy cattle) is contraindicated, since it caused
deleterious post-vaccination reactions (sharp milk-yield drop and mild,
though temporary, LSD-like lesions). - Mod.AS]
