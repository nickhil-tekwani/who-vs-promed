Thirty-two persons are currently receiving vaccine against rabies in Cholul community, after 3 dogs in the area were reported to have the disease, according to a report from health authorities. The Health Secretary decreed an epidemiological barrier of 15 kilometers around Cholul community. Dr. Alvaro Quijano-Vivas, State Health Secretary, reported that this epidemiological barrier including Sitpach and Cholul was established because 3 dogs tested positive for rabies.

Thirty-two residents in the aforementioned areas are now receiving preventive therapy (rabies immunization) [More often this is referred to as Post Exposure Prophylaxis or PEP- Mod.TG]. This is to prevent the occurrence of the disease in these persons who had contact with the infected animals.

Dr. Quijano-Vivas said that for the past 3 years, no cases of rabies in dogs or cats had been reported in the affected area. "The important thing is that no human cases have been reported, and preventive measures have been implemented right on time".

Dr. Quijano-Vivas also announced that from 11 to 17 March [2012?], the Second National Rabies Vaccination Campaign for Dogs and Cats will take place, with this slogan: "Have you vaccinated your pets against rabies? They are part of your family and protecting them is your responsibility."

On the other hand, Mr. Daly Gabino Martinez-Ortiz, general coordinator for Zoonoses in the Health Secretary, pointed out that rabies is commonly transmitted to homeless dogs after being bitten by hematophagous bats.

More than three hundred-thousand (300,000) doses of rabies vaccine will be administered to pets during the next campaign scheduled for next March.

[The article is unclear if this rabies drive is scheduled for portions of March 2012 or if it is March 2013. Given the outbreak is now it would seem unusual to wait a full year.

Their slogan for the campaign is really quite good. It is the owner’s duty to protect the pet, but in so doing it is a building that epidemiological barrier for people. When our pets are vaccinated, and thus protected against rabies, we are also better protected against that disease.
