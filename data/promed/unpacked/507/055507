Hepatitis C cases on the rise locally
------------------------------
What a difference a decade can make. In 2002, there were just 23 cases of hepatitis C reported to the Ross County Health District. Fast-forward to 2012, and that has increased to 172. Hepatitis C is a Class A reportable disease in Ohio. A virus that affects the liver, hepatitis C most often is spread through the blood of an infected person. Before 1992, the virus could be spread by way of blood transfusions or organ transplants. New screenings were implemented that year, and today, most hepatitis C cases are a result of dirty needles and drug use.

"It's a sad, sad, sign of the times in our community," said Kathy Wakefield, Director of Public Health Nursing at the health district. "Hepatitis C can be fatal, but even when it's not, it requires a lifetime of medical care." The health district's 2012 Annual Report also showed high levels of the sexually transmitted disease chlamydia were reported, with 199 cases. That's an increase of 18 from 2011.

Gonorrhea, with 38 reported cases, also was up from the previous few years. Hepatitis B was up by 9 cases from 23 in 2012; pertussis, or whooping cough, was down to just 3 cases last year; chicken pox was up to 19 cases compared to 11 in 2011; and there were 3 infections of E. coli reported. "Besides the hep C numbers, there was nothing that really stood out," Wakefield said. "But the nearly constant increase in hep C cases is certainly a concern."

Sanitarians also performed 34 inspections of tattoo and body piercing establishments, licensing 21. "Of course needles are used in that line of work, so we need to ensure that the people doing that work are trained and educated in health and sanitization matters," Avery said. "After all, we know that hepatitis C is out there and we need to do our part to keep those numbers down.

[Hepatitis C is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with hepatitis C virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C virus is usually spread when blood from an infected person enters the body of a susceptible person. It is among the most common viruses that infect the liver. Hepatitis C may be transmitted through sex with an infected person or sharing of personal items contaminated with infectious blood, but these are less common. Hepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food or water or by casual contact an infected person.

About 75-85 percent of newly infected persons develop chronic disease and 60-70 percent of chronically infected people develop chronic liver disease; 5-20 percent develop cirrhosis and 1-5 percent die from cirrhosis or liver cancer. In 25 percent of liver cancer patients, the underlying cause is hepatitis C. There is currently no vaccine for hepatitis C; however, hepatitis C virus infection is becoming susceptible to treatment with a range of antiviral compounds.

It is unclear from this report whether this increased prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Ross County is directly related to tattooing and body piercing. Further information would be welcomed, in particular whether there has been an associated increase in other blood-borne infections (Hepatitis B And HIV in particular).

Ross County is located in the Appalachian region of the state of Ohio. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 78 064. Its county seat is Chillicothe, the 1st and 3rd capital of Ohio. The Chillicothe Micropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Ross County. A map of the counties of Ohio can be accessed at: http://geology.com/county-map/ohio.shtml. - Mod.CP
