[1] Minnesota cases/Sam's Club recall

The Minnesota Department of Health says 4 children were sickened with
_E. coli_ [O157:H7] after eating pre-made frozen beef patties
purchased at Sam's Club stores in the metro area. All 4 got sick
between 10 and 20 Sep 2007 after eating "American Chef's Selection
Angus Beef Patties." One of the ill children remains in the hospital,
the others have recovered.
"The Sam's Club stores currently involved include the Eagan, Maple
Grove and White Bear Lake stores. However, we can't be certain that
meat from other stores is not involved, since the brand of implicated
frozen ground beef patties was likely sold at other Sam's Club
locations," Heidi Kassenborg, Acting Director of the Dairy and Food
Inspection Division of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture said.
Sam's Club has voluntarily removed American Chef's Selection Angus
Frozen Ground Beef Patties from all of their stores, and health
officials say they are cooperating with the investigation. The
Minnesota Department of Agriculture is working with the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to determine the source of the _E. coli_
contamination.

Cargill Meat Solutions said it is voluntarily recalling approximately
844 812 pounds of frozen ground beef patties because they may be
contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7.
The recall is based on an investigation by the Minnesota Department
of Health and Minnesota Department of Agriculture as well as
Cargill's investigation and findings from a food safety assessment
conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture at the Cargill Meat
Solutions ground beef plant in Butler, Wisconsin. Minnesota officials
had investigated 4 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection involving
individuals who had consumed American Chef's Selection Angus Beef
Patties purchased at Sam's Club stores in the state. While the
investigation is ongoing, Cargill is voluntarily recalling the
products based on a preliminary analysis of epidemiological data.
The products subject to the recall were produced on 9, 10, 15, 16 and

"We are concerned that some consumers may still have the product sold
at retail in their freezers," said Bill Rupp, president of Cargill
Meat Solutions. "We and Sam's Club are urging customers to return or
destroy any American Chef's Selection Angus Beef Patties purchased in
any of their stores since August [2007]."
Rupp said the company learned of the situation shortly before noon on
Friday [5 Oct 2007]. Based on information from Minnesota and USDA
officials, the company investigated further and expanded the scope
beyond Minnesota. Although the extent of any contamination is
unknown, Cargill Meat Solutions has undertaken the voluntary recall
as a proactive and cautionary step.
Food safety experts recommend cooking any ground beef to an internal
temperature of 160 F or until the meat is no longer pink and the
juices run clear. Also, avoid contaminating other foods with any _E.
coli_ bacteria that may be present in meat by:
- Washing hands, utensils and cutting boards after they have been in
contact with raw meat before they touch other food.
- Putting cooked meat on a clean platter rather than on the other one
that was used to hold raw meat.
