Suspected Ebola outbreak hits 6th country: Morocco; one step from Europe
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola outbreak in west Africa has now expanded to a 6th country: Morocco, and is just one step away from reaching Spain and the continent of Europe. Suspected cases: 2, deaths: 0.

Comment on stability of ebolaviruses from Nigerian biomedical and life scientists

[Doubts have been raised in internet discussions about whether the serological tests being used to detect ebolavirus infections in this outbreak are valid for the virus currently circulating in West Africa. - Mod.JW]

On the Nigerian biomedical and life scientists Yahoo Groups list, Shamsudeen Fagbo <oloungbo@yahoo.com> wrote:

Scientists, including those from France and the USA, working for years on Ebola have documented that the viruses involved in past outbreaks -- spatially and temporally diverse -- are very stable.

In the absence of novel unpublished work [that is] contrary to the references below, we should stick to the evidence we know and not escalate panic. A diagnostic approach of the CDC during the Ugandan outbreak depended mainly on serology to delineate the epidemiological picture and control the outbreak. Molecular tools are sexy but have limitations in real life outbreak situations. It cannot give you answers about infections in post-viremic, convalescent individuals. Understanding the scenario demands reviewing the detailed case and exposure history of the patients -- which is where the skills, or absence thereof, of clinicians come into question.

Background
----------
[Ebolavirus] is one of the most virulent pathogens, killing a very high proportion of patients within 5-7 days. 2 outbreaks of fulminating haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Gabon in 1996, with a 70 per cent case fatality rate. During both outbreaks we identified some individuals in direct contact with sick patients who never developed symptoms. We aimed to determine whether these individuals were indeed infected with Ebolavirus, and how they maintained asymptomatic status.

Findings
--------
11 of 24 asymptomatic individuals developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola antigens, indicating viral infection. Western-blot analysis showed that IgG responses were directed to nucleoprotein and viral protein of 40 kDa. The glycoprotein and viral protein of 24 kDa genes showed no nucleotide differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic individuals had a strong inflammatory response characterised by high circulating concentrations of cytokines and chemokines.

Interpretation
--------------
This study showed that asymptomatic, replicative Ebola infection can and does occur in human beings. The lack of genetic differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals suggest that asymptomatic Ebola infection did not result from viral mutations. Elucidation of the factors related to the genesis of the strong inflammatory response occurring early during the infectious process in these asymptomatic individuals could increase our understanding of the disease.

Abstract
--------
Ebola virus persistence was examined in body fluids from 12 convalescent patients by virus isolation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during the 1995 Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Virus RNA could be detected for up to 33 days in vaginal, rectal, and conjunctival swabs of 1 patient and up to 101 days in the seminal fluid of 4 patients. Infectious virus was detected in 1 seminal fluid sample obtained 82 days after disease onset. Sequence analysis of an RT-PCR fragment of the most variable region of the glycoprotein gene amplified from 9 patients revealed no nucleotide changes. The patient samples were selected so that they would include some from a suspected line of transmission with at least 3 human-to-human passages, some from 5 survivors and 4 deceased patients, and 2 from patients who provided multiple samples through convalescence. There was no evidence of different virus variants cocirculating during the outbreak or of genetic variation accumulating during human-to-human passage or during prolonged persistence in individual patients.

[We remain in suspense about whether the ebolavirus has crossed the Mali border.

The references in Shamsudeen's comment above are useful reminders that we do not have to search now for a new, different ebolavirus strain, and that existing ebolavirus reagents are still reliable. - Mod.JW]
