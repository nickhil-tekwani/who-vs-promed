Sheep pox - Kyrgyzstan (Priissikulye)
-------------------------------------------
Cases of sheep pox have been recorded in one household in the village
of Yurgali, close to Issik-Kul, Tyupsk district [northeast
Kyrgyzstan; see map at
<http://geography.about.com/library/cia/nckyrgyzstan.htm>].
2 animals out of 18 have died. The representatives of the District
Veterinary Services of Tyupsk have discovered that the disease was
introduced through sheep bought into the regional central animal
market at Karakol by another farmer who lives in the nearby village
of Orgochora (Jati-Oguz district).
The affected farm in Yurgali has been put under quarantine. Vets are
carrying out vaccinations in the affected village as well as in the
adjacent villages Oy-Tal and Kichi-Oruktu.

[According to Kyrgyzstan's reports to the OIE, sheep pox's last
occurrence there was recorded in February 1997. Preventive
vaccination is applied in regions at risk. The disease is endemic in
neighboring China. - Mod.AS]
[The current taxonomy (8th ICTV Report) places _Sheeppox virus_ as
the type species of the genus _Capripoxvirus_. This genus comprises 3
species: _Goatpox virus_, _Lumpy skin disease virus_ and _Sheeppox
virus_. Apart from their predominant host and different geographical
distributions, the 3 viruses are very similar. Extensive
cross-reactivity and cross-protection is observed between the 3
species of the genus. - Mod.CP]
