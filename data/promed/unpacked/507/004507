A West Australian sheep has been found to have signs characteristic
of the fatal brain disease atypical scrapie. It comes as Australia
faces growing anger from its trade partners over the Rudd
government's surprise decision to extend a ban on the importation of
beef from countries exposed to mad cow disease for a further 2 years.

Australia's chief veterinarian, Andy Carroll, told the ABC an
indicative case of the atypical scrapie had been confirmed but said
it posed no risk to human or animal health or the safety of eating
meat and animal products.

Nor does atypical scrapie carry the dire trade consequences
associated with classical scrapie.

Classical scrapie is in the same transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies (TSE) family as BSE, better known as mad cow
disease, from which humans can be fatally infected.

Dr Carroll said samples from the sheep's brain were being sent to the
World Reference Laboratory in Britain.

Neither atypical scrapie nor classical scrapie has been seen in
Australia before, but a sheep in New Zealand tested positive to the
atypical form last year [2009].

Atypical scrapie is a relatively recently discovered disease and the
common scientific view is that it occurs spontaneously or naturally
in very small numbers of older sheep in countries all over the world.

Animal health authorities are testing a sheep's brain for what could
be Australia's 1st case of the disease atypical scrapie.

Although not confirmed, the sheep is thought to be from Western Australia.

This type of scrapie is described as a sporadic degenerative brain
condition affecting older sheep, and is not contagious.

Ed Klim, from national advisory group SafeMeat, says a 2nd round of
testing is now taking place. "We've been made aware that the
Australian Animal Health Laboratory is conducting further routine
testing on a sheep sample," he says.

"The disease isn't considered a health risk nor should have any
impact on food safety or export markets for sheep meat of live sheep."

Australia's chief veterinarian and WA's Department of Agriculture of
Food are both aware of the testing but will not comment.

[Although atypical scrapie is not yet ruled out, it is important to
realize this is a type of scrapie that thus far has only tended to
appear as a sporadic condition in older animals. Currently it has not
been shown to follow the same genetic tendencies for propagation as
the usual scrapie.

However, the atypical phenotypic appearance has been shown to be
preserved on experimental passage.

Atypical scrapie was first identified in Norwegian sheep in 1998 and
has subsequently been identified in many countries, as Australia may
join that list. It is likely that this case will be sent to the UK
for definitive conformation.

"Background
-----------
"Retrospective studies have identified cases predating the initial
identification of this form of scrapie, and epidemiological studies
have indicated that it does not conform to the behaviour of an
infectious disease, giving rise to the hypothesis that it represents
spontaneous disease. However, atypical scrapie isolates have been
shown to be infectious experimentally, through intracerebral
inoculation in transgenic mice and sheep. [Many of the neurological
diseases can be transmitted by intracerebral inoculation, which
causes this moderator to approach intracerebral studies as a tool for
study, but not necessarily as a direct indication of transmissibility
of natural diseases. - Mod.TG]

"The 1st successful challenge of a sheep with 'field' atypical
scrapie from an homologous donor sheep was reported in 2007.

"Results
--------
"This study demonstrates that atypical scrapie has distinct clinical,
pathological, and biochemical characteristics which are maintained on
transmission and sub-passage, and which are distinct from other
strains of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in the same host
genotype.

"Conclusions
------------
Atypical scrapie is consistently transmissible within AHQ homozygous
sheep, and the disease phenotype is preserved on sub-passage."

Lastly, this moderator wishes to thank Terry Singletary for some of
