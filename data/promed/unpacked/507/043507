A 2nd outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in domestic pigs was confirmed in Bulgaria on Wed [3 Jul 2019], the country's Food Safety Agency said in a statement on its website.

The disease has been found in a small farm in the village of Zhernov near the Danube River, some 210 km [130 mi] northeast of Sofia. A total of 14 pigs were fattened in the farm, the statement said.

All measures have been taken to eradicate the outbreak and prevent its spreading, such as setting up a protection zone and an observation area around the outbreak. There are no industrial pig farms in the observation area, the statement said.

The 1st outbreak of ASF in domestic pigs in Bulgaria was confirmed last August [2018] in the village of Tutrakantsi, some 415 km [258 mi] east of Sofia.

[An immediate notification, addressing this event, was submitted to the OIE earlier today (Wed 4 Jul 2019) and is available, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30979.

The OIE report includes the following comment: "ASF outbreak was confirmed in backyard pigs by the NRL, by real-time PCR method, in the village of Zhernov, region of Pleven (6 km [3.7 mi] away from the border with Romania). Control and eradication measures have been taken in accordance with the Council Directive 2002/60/EC." The holding included 14 animals, of which 2 died of ASF; the remaining 12 animals have been killed and destroyed.

It may be assumed that this is a new introduction into Bulgaria; results of the epidemiological investigation into the route of introduction (from adjacent, ASF-infected Romania?) are anticipated. The situation in local wild boars deserves special attention. - Mod.AS
