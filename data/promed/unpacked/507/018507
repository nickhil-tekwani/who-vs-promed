There has been a new fatal case of hantavirus infection in a 49-year-old woman who died in Chubut, and there are now 13 deaths.

The woman was hospitalized in intensive care in the Esquel Zone Hospital. Just in Chubut, there are 11 infected who lost their lives.

SB, a 49-year-old woman, resident of Trevelin, died in recent hours as a result of an outbreak in Chubut this past December [2018]. With this situation, there are now 13 fatal victims in the entire country as a result of this virus disease.

According to the confirmation of the provincial Ministry of Health, the woman died while in the intensive therapy unit of the Esquel Zone Hospital. She had been admitted this past Monday [14 Jan 2019] to the health center with symptoms and placed "under observation."

SB was the mother of the young girl (JL) who had lost her life to the same disease. It is presumed that SB was infected by the virus while she was caring for her daughter.

The last part of the Ministry of Health of Chubut release this Saturday [19 Jan 2018] reports that since the beginning of the epidemiological contingency (on 3 Dec [2018]) in that province, there were 29 confirmed cases (27 in Esquel, one in Bariloche and another in Chile), of which 11 died, 9 [others] were discarded, while the 3 remaining infected individuals remain hospitalized in the same hospital, 2 of them in intensive care. [Case numbers confirmed by the Chubut Ministry of Health on 23 Jan 2019 (http://www.ministeriodesalud.chubut.gov.ar/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/PARTE-n-53-23-de-enero-1.pdf)].

In addition to what is going on in Chubut, the National Secretariat of Health stated that in Argentina there are 4 risk regions: North (Salta, Jujuy), Central (Buenos Aires, Santa Fe and Entre Rios), Northeast (Misiones) and South (Nequen, Rio Negro).

The registered cases total 5 confirmed in Buenos Aires, in the districts of San Pedro, Zarate, Navarro, Lomas de Zamora y Berisso.

The communication of the Buenos Aires Ministry of Health insisted in their remarks that "these are usual cases" for this season of the year and that the "5 confirmed cases of the infection resulted from contact with rodent excrement as is usual in the province and is not like the situation of Epuyen with person to person infection."

According to official statistics, during 2018, there were 25 cases registered in Buenos Aires province, while in 2017, there were 44 cases.

The Buenos Aires Minister of Health, Andr√©s Scarsi, requested that the health regions "intensify clinical suspicion when facing presented febrile cases." To avoid contagion, the provincial health office recommended that people, "do not have contact with rodent secretions (especially the one called "long tail"), ventilate places that have been closed (houses, sheds, offices and other spaces) for 30 minutes, dampen the floor with water and bleach before mopping and avoid sweeping, and close openings in doors, walls and around pipes.

The symptoms that must motivate a medical consultation are fever, respiratory difficulty, headache and pain in the abdomen, joints and muscles," he reminded everyone.

Hantavirus infection is a serious, acute viral disease caused by a hantavirus that is transmitted to people by way of contact with the saliva, feces and urine of infected wild rodents (mainly the long tails) that once dried can be inhaled. There are different hantavirus species, and the one that caused this outbreak [in Chubut] is the Andes strain.

[Interpersonal transmission of the current Andes hantavirus outbreak in Chubut is unusual. However, person to person transmission has happened before. Mod.PMB provided a reference that indicates that there was an outbreak of Andes virus Epilink/96 variant in El Bolson, Rio Negro province and that starting with the index case, a molecular analysis indicated that 15 cases occurred subsequently. Of these 16 patients, 9 died. Of the total cases, 8 probably became infected in a hospital environment, including 5 physicians (3 died) and a receptionist in a private clinic where 4 more cases occurred. The receptionist died. The data in this study suggest the possible existence of 3- and 4-person transmission chains, assuming that only one rodent-to-human transmission event occurred.

An additional study described 4 clusters of cases in Argentina with probable interpersonal transmission: the 1st a father to son, the 2nd in a rural family, the 3rd among 4 friends who shared a rural cabin, and the 4th a person in contact with another person who, in turn contacted a further person.

It is clear that interpersonal Andes hantavirus transmission occurs, although infrequently, more often than ProMED-mail has reported. - Mod.TY]

[2] Entre Rios province, clarification
Date: 22 Jul 2019


A reliable source indicates that there has been just one hantavirus infection case in the province so far this year (2019), not 11. The 11 cases probably referred to the total case count for all of Argentina at the time.

The Ministry of Health, by way of the Office of the Director of the Provincial Promotion and Health, has announced that a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] has been diagnosed in the city of Esperanza. The case has progressed well clinically and currently is in complete remission of symptoms; this case is not related to the current outbreak in Epuyen, since the patient has not traveled nor was in contact with people who have traveled.

[The report goes on to present general information about symptoms and preventive measures for hantavirus infections that have been covered above and in earlier reports. - Mod.TY]

[The specific hantavirus involved in this case is not mentioned.

Santa Fe province is located in the northeast part of Argentina, far from the Andes Mountains and Chubut province where the current outbreak has occurred. Santa Fe province adjoins Entre Rios province where the single case occurred earlier this month (January 2019) (see above and ProMED-mail post Hantavirus - Americas (05): Argentina (4 provinces) RFI 20190121.6266515). - Mod.TY
