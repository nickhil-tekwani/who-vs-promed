When a Minnesota teenager was admitted to a hospital last April [2015] with a fever of 102.9 degrees, and tested negative for flu or a bacterial infection, investigators were temporarily stumped. The patient also had photophobia, a stiff neck, and headache, signs of meningitis.

Fewer than half of meningitis cases in the US are diagnosed as to what infectious agent caused them.

Doctors treated the patient for possible bacterial or herpes simplex virus meningitis but neither turned out to be the agent causing her illness. Nor was it tuberculosis, HIV, Lyme disease, or a long list of other microbes that could have caused the meningitis.

Then on the 4th day of the patient's hospitalization laboratory results were positive for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) antibody.

At that point the local physicians called in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's [CDC] special pathogens branch, because of the uncommon diagnosis.

The CDC's testing confirmed LCMV was the culprit. Then it was up to the local officials in Minnesota to figure out where it had come from, and whether others were at risk.

The family had earlier reported a rodent problem in their duplex apartment. A state health department inspection found it was ongoing, with mouse droppings in a pantry.

The droppings turned out to have come from a _Mus musculus_, the common house mouse. According to the CDC, about 5% of US house mice carry LCMV and human infection occurs by inhaling aerosolized urine or droppings of infected rodents.

In addition to causing meningitis, the virus causes birth defects in fetuses exposed in utero. It can also cause infections in immunosuppressed recipients in organ transplant cases.

But in the past, testing mice for LCMV has meant trapping and killing them.

In the Minnesota case, the fecal pellets from the mouse (or mice) were tested and found positive for LCMV.

"This is the 1st report to identify LCMV-infected mice through fecal pellet testing," the CDC's Pamela Talley, MD and colleagues wrote in this week's edition of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Review.

In the United States, an etiologic agent is identified in <50% of meningoencephalitis cases; some undiagnosed cases might be caused by LCMV.

Collaboration among clinicians, public health investigators, and local housing authorities can facilitate integrated pest management to decrease the risk for LCMV infection.

Lymphocytic choriomeningitis, or LCM, is a rodent-borne viral infectious disease caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a member of the family _Arenaviridae_, that was initially isolated in 1933.

The primary host of LCMV is the common house mouse, _Mus musculus_. Infection in house mouse populations may vary by geographic location, though it is estimated that 5% of house mice throughout the United States carry LCMV and are able to transmit virus for the duration of their lives without showing any sign of illness.

LCMV infections have been reported in Europe, the Americas, Australia, and Japan, and may occur wherever infected rodent hosts of the virus are found. The disease has historically been under-reported, often making it difficult to determine incidence rates or estimates of prevalence by geographic region. Several serologic studies conducted in urban areas have shown that the prevalence of LCMV antibodies in human populations range from 2% to 5%.

Additionally, pregnancy-related infection has been associated with congenital hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, and mental retardation.
