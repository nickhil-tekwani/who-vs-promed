Maryland health officials have confirmed the presence of the same type of
botulinum bacteria in 2 infants living on the same street at Fort Meade,
each of whom was recently diagnosed as having botulism, the Army said
yesterday, 1 Feb 2007.
The 1st case was diagnosed in October 2006, the other in December 2006. The
children, each of whom was under 6 months of age at the time, live on
Oliver Court, a residential area on the Anne Arundel County Army
post. Both children have been treated and are recovering, according to a
statement from Fort Meade.
The _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria found in stool samples from both
infants can be found naturally in some soil as well as in contaminated
food. Finding the same type in both infants is an indication that the cases
could be related, and further testing may be done, officials
said. "There's interest in 2 cases being close by," said Travis Edwards, a
Fort Meade spokesman.
In January 2007, Fort Meade authorities used hay to cover soil and keep
down dust at a work site about a quarter of a mile from the childrens'
homes. The investigation is also looking into whether the 2 children could
have eaten the same food or otherwise been similarly exposed to a source
for the illness.
Soil at the site is being tested, but results are not available, Edwards
said. The lot will be sodded and no longer used as a work site. Col.
Kenneth McReedy, the installation commander, has directed that no lots near
residential areas be used in the future for construction activities,
Edwards said.

[Two cases of infant botulism such as occurred at Fort Meade are unusual,
and ProMED awaits more information. The toxin type is not mentioned in the
posting.
In ProMED posting 20070112.0159. Dr. Stephen Arnon outlined the use of
specific antitoxin treatment for infant botulism:
"Human Botulism Immune Globulin (Intravenous) (BIG-IV, BabyBIG) for the
treatment of infant botulism types A and B was licensed on 23 Oct 2003 by
the FDA to the California Department of Health Services (CDHS). BabyBIG is
a public service orphan drug that is available nationwide (and
internationally by special arrangement) from the Infant Botulism Treatment
and Prevention Program, CDHS, through its 24/7 telephone number
510-231-7600. Additional information on obtaining BabyBIG, infant botulism,
diagnostic specimen collection and management may be found at the IBTPP's
website, <http://www.infantbotulism.org>.
Treatment with BabyBIG is based on clinical findings and should not be
delayed for laboratory confirmation of diagnosis, as early treatment
(within 0-3 days of hospital admission) shortens hospital stay
significantly more than does later (4-7 days) treatment. The results of
the clinical studies that qualified BIG-IV for licensure were published in
2006 (Arnon SS, Schechter R, Maslanka SE, et al: Human botulism immune
globulin for the treatment of infant botulism. N Engl J Med 2006;354:
462-71). Treatment with BabyBIG significantly shortened mean hospital stay
and costs, intensive care unit stay, ventilator time, and iv or tube
feeding time."
Fort George G. Meade, is 5 miles northeast of the city of Laurel, Maryland.
The fort is named for General George Meade, a Union Army general in the USA
Civil War. The general location can be found at:
