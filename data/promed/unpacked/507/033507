Influenza update - 331 (based on data up to 9 Dec 2018)
------------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere influenza activity continued to increase, although overall influenza activity remained low. Increased influenza detections were reported in some countries of Southern and South-East Asia. In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, influenza activity returned to inter-seasonal levels. Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 115 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 26 Nov 2018 to 9 Dec 2018 (data as of 12 Dec 2018 14:17:33 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 139 511 specimens during that time period. 10 520 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 9970 (94.8 percent) were typed as influenza A and 550 (5.2 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 4961 (84.1 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 936 (15.9 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 85 (63 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 50 (37 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Flu cases doubled and 2 deaths have been reported in Georgia so far this winter [2018-19], according to the country's National Center for Disease Control and Public Health on [Tue 25 Dec 2018].

"We now have 221 reported cases per 100 000 citizens," said Pata Imnadze, scientific director of the center, adding that this number is twice last year's.

Most flu cases detected this year [2018] are the H1N1 type and very few cases are involved with the H3N2 virus, which is more fatal, he said.

However, there is no influenza outbreak in Georgia so far though the situation [requires caution], he noted.

According to the center, 2 persons, including one pregnant woman, have been killed by flu infections so far during the current flu season in Georgia.

Last winter [2017-18], over 200 H1N1-infection cases were reported in Georgia, resulting in at least 8 deaths.
