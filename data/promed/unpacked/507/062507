Yellow fever - Nigeria 941216
Date: Wed 17 May 2000
From: ProMED-mail

We have heard from a reliable source that an outbreak of yellow fever (YF)
has been suspected in Kano city and Ekiti State since 3 Apr 2000, with 6
cases, of which one has now been laboratory confirmed.
As of 14:00 EST on Wed 17 May we have not seen any confirmation of this on
WHO Outbreak news, nor in the WER, nor in media reports. We would welcome
any information on the subject. If there are vector mosquitoes in Kano,
which is a huge city on the edge of the Sahel, the situation could be very
threatening.
