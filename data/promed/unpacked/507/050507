Cholera outbreak grips Burundi
-------------------------------
A cholera epidemic has struck the town of Rumonge in the central African
state of Burundi, with at least 140 cases and a death reported since
mid-October 2004, a local council official said on Fri 29 Oct 2004.
Emile Hicintuka, an administrative official of the town, about 100 km south
of the capital, Bujumbura said: "Yesterday [Thu 28 Oct 2004], 20 people
were hospitalized, compared to 40 the day before."
Cholera was endemic in the town due to "lack of drinking water and poor
hygiene typical of Rumonge," said local health care chief Dr. Gloriose
Nahimana. "The arrival of the rainy season every year worsens the
situation, and this time the problem has become particularly acute," she
warned.
Hicintuka said 20 cases had been admitted to Rumonge hospital on Thu 28 Oct
2004, bringing the total to 140 since the outbreak began on 12 Oct 2004.
"We've had confirmation for 5 days now that it's a cholera outbreak,
because we've had analyses done in Bujumbura," he said. Despite its size,
about 50 000 inhabitants, Rumonge did not have suitable laboratory
facilities, the official admitted.
"Several non-governmental organizations are on hand to help out," he
explained: "They are distributing drinking water, disinfecting houses and
unsanitary premises, and providing instruction in hygiene."

Cholera outbreak in Ugandan camp, 2 dead
-------------------------------------------
Aid workers said that the disease, which broke out in Pabbo camp, 400 km
north of the Ugandan capital Kampala, was caused by poor sanitary
conditions, including a lack of pit latrines, for the 62 000 war-displaced
people living in the camp.
50 people, including 9 children and 17 women, were infected when the
disease broke out. 2 men died, 39 people recovered, and 9 were still being
treated, according to Elianne Duthoit, the head of the UN Humanitarian
Coordination office in Kampala.
"A number of relief agencies moved in to contain the situation. We are
embarking on building more latrines in the camp, providing jerry cans, and
community health workers are sensitizing the population, telling them the
advantages of using chlorinated water," Duthoit said by telephone on Thu 28
Oct 2004.
"We had 50 cases since the outbreak. The cause is poor sanitation. There
were not enough latrines. Now there is a coordination group which meets
regularly to review the situation," she said.

[3] Cholera - Senegal

The number of people infected in an outbreak of cholera in the Dakar region
of Senegal has risen to 126, the committee charged with monitoring the
spread of the disease said on Wed 27 Oct 2004.
On Tue 26 Oct 2004, the health ministry said 84 cases had been recorded, 2
of which had been fatal, since the 1st patients were identified on 11 Oct 2004.
"Up until today [Wed 27 Oct 2004], we have counted 126 declared cases of
cholera nationwide," according to Professor Papa Salif Sow, head of the
infectious diseases service at Dakar's Fann hospital and committee coordinator.
The outbreak is the 1st reappearance of cholera in the West African state
of Senegal since 1997. Medical sources say the last epidemic took place in
1995 to 1996. The 1st cases in the current outbreak were recorded in the
working class district of Colobane in central Dakar. Cases were later found
throughout the capital and its suburbs.
2 suspected cases have been identified at Rufisque, about 30 km from Dakar,
a senior health ministry official told reporters, but none in the country's
hinterland. Health professionals remain on alert, and clinics are
continuing to receive the medical supplies needed to contain the outbreak.
In schools and colleges, hygiene lessons have been introduced, and the
street sale of plastic bags of water, and of fruit and vegetables, in Dakar
has been banned.
"We have launched disinfection campaigns in houses in which sick people
live, and around stagnant water, to prevent them becoming reservoirs for
bacteria," Sow said.

20 confirmed cases of shigellosis at school
---------------------------------------
20 cases of shigellosis have now been confirmed in Lansing. The
announcement comes as Ingham County health officials continue to review
their laboratory results. Shigellosis was 1st discovered early last week
[4th week of October 2004] at Willow Elementary in Lansing.
Health officials say at least 3 of the newly confirmed cases may have been
spread by a person carrying the bacteria. At least 20 more cases are still
being investigated. Now, officials believe the outbreak is under control
and are searching for how it all started. They've been racing against time
to find the origin and prevent future spreading.
Diane Gorch, Supervisor of the Food Safety Program at Ingham Health
Department, said: "We need to get this information in a timely way so we
can get it all in, grind it up and see what we can learn from it."
She's one of 6 people working long hours trying get to the bottom of the
shigellosis outbreak. By making numerous phone calls, and going door to
door, they're gathering information from Willow Elementary students and
their families.
