A 23 year old woman from Thanh Hoa Province died of bird flu on Wednesday
[22 Apr 2009], Viet Nam's 4th fatality from the disease this year, an
official from the Health Ministry confirmed on Friday [24 Apr 2009].

Nguyen Huy Nga, head of the ministry's Bureau of Preventive Health and
Environment, said the victim was from Quan Hoa District in the central
province. Though the bureau confirmed the victim had been infected with the
H5N1 avian [influenza] virus, no birds had been affected by the disease in
the area recently. The woman was admitted to Quan Hoa General Hospital last
Thursday [16 Apr 2009] before being transferred to Thanh Hoa General
Hospital in critical condition on Tuesday [21 Apr 2009]. She was suffering
from pleural and pericardial effusion and kidney failure at the time.

A team from the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology and local
health authorities failed to find any trace of bird flu in Thien Phu
Commune, where the woman lived.

All 4 human bird flu cases in Viet Nam this year [2009] have proved fatal.
