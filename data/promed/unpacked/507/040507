[This is the WHO confirmation of the 2 cases described in ProMED-mail post
"Avian influenza, human (176): Indonesia 20061113.3253." The WHO Cumulative
Table of Laboratory Confirmed Cases of Avian Influenza Virus A(H5N1) has
been updated now to Mon 13 Nov 2006 to include these 2 new cases and gives
the total number of cases as 74 with 56 deaths (and not the 75 cases and 56
deaths reported previously from Indonesia sources). The status of the
single suspected case reported in the ProMED-mail post "Avian influenza,
human (174): Indonesia, susp 20061107.3197" remains unresolved.
The overall global total of avian influenza cases now becomes 258 with 153
fatalities.
