The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today (25 Sep 2015) investigating an outbreak of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) at a kindergarten cum child care centre in Yuen Long [a district in the northwest of the New Territories of Hong Kong] affecting 21 pupils, and hence appealed to the public to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene. The 21 affected pupils, 9 boys and 12 girls aged between 2 and 5, have developed fever, oral ulcers, and rash and vesicles on their hands or feet since 8 Aug 2015. All of them sought medical attention and did not require hospitalisation. They have been in a stable condition all along.

The stool specimen of an affected pupil tested positive for enterovirus (EV) upon laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Officers of the CHP have conducted a site visit and advised the staff of the kindergarten on necessary infection control and preventive measures. The school has been put under medical surveillance. Investigations are ongoing.

"HFMD is common in children and is usually caused by EVs [Enteroviruses] such as Coxsackie virus and Enterovirus 71. It is clinically characterised by maculopapular rash or vesicular lesions occurring on the palms, soles and other parts of the body such as the buttocks and thighs. Vesicular lesions and ulcers may also be found in the oral cavity. Sometimes patients present mainly with painful ulcers at the back of the mouth, namely herpangina, without rash on the hands or feet," a spokesman for the CHP explained.

To prevent HFMD, members of the public, and especially the management of institutions, should take heed of the following preventive measures:
- Maintain good air circulation;
- Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet or handling diapers or other stool-soiled materials;
- Keep hands clean and wash hands properly, especially when they are dirtied by respiratory secretions, such as after sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and oral discharges properly;
- Clean children's toys and other objects thoroughly and frequently (with 5.25 per cent sodium hypochlorite to 49 parts of water), followed by rinsing or wiping with clean water;
- Children who are ill should be kept out of school until their fever and rash have subsided and all the vesicles have dried and crusted; and
- Parents should maintain close communication with schools to let them know the latest [condition] of their sick children.

The public may visit the CHP's page on HFMD and EV71 infection for more information.
