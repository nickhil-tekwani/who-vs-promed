[1] Cholera - Thailand (Pattani)

Status of current cholera outbreak in Pattani province
-------------------------------------------------------
According to the most recent information available to us from the
Pattani health care team and the SRRT [Surveillance Rapid Response
Team], from mid-October [2009] till today [13 Nov 2009], there have
been 93 people identified to have _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor Ogawa
infection. Most of the infected people were fishermen and their
family members, who live in fishery communities on the Pattani
riverbanks. Among these 93 people, 33 patients sought treatment at
local hospitals (28 in Pattani, 4 in Kok Poh hospital, and 1 in Sai
Buri hospital).

Pattani Health Care teams, SRRTs as well as FETP [Field Epidemiology
Training Program] team conducted outreach activities aimed at further
case detection in the communities. The outreach teams did house to
house surveys and interviews. Approximately 500 people (who were at
risk of infection) were reached and 393 rectal swabs were collected.
Subsequently, 60 positive cultures [_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 El Tor
Ogawa] were detected. Of these, 46 culture positive individuals never
had any diarrhea, and 14 had a mild watery diarrhea.

Active investigations and food and water samples were collected for
laboratory testing. Household drinking water of the patients (2
samples) tested negative and 20 samples from ice water and ice used
for fish cold storage were all negative. Among 7 food samples, 2
positives were identified, and drinking water samples taken from in
the fishing vessels/boats (8 samples) had 3 positives identified.

The isolated _Vibrio_ organism had the following antibiotic profile:
norfloxacin 100 percent sensitivity, amoxicillin 63 percent,
cotrimoxazole 8 percent, and tetracycline 7 percent (as for
comparison).

The clinical finding indicates mild disease, with a high proportion
of asymptomatic infections and no deaths. However, the bacterium has
a profile of high resistance to tetracycline antibiotic. Even though
the infection/outbreak mostly are located in the fishery communities,
along the Pattani river there is a high possibility of widespread
extension among the communities and it can potentially be transmitted
to other villages as well as cross infection among the different
boats when they go out to sea and move to other ports for fish trade.

The Pattani health officials made every effort to educate the whole
communities, provide soap and concentrated chlorine water, and
provide education materials in the local language and in different
foreign languages as many of fishermen are non-Thai immigrants,
mostly from Myanmar and Cambodia. With cooperation from the fishing
boat owners and the fish market operators, surveillance and active
case screening have been ongoing. Plans are for continuous monitoring
for food safety, and testing for level of chorine in drinking water.
Coordinated operations by health authorities have been set up and
daily responses have been implemented.

We expect to have a better understanding of the scope of the
epidemic, population at risk, and risk factors for infection soon
with the coverage of community surveillance.

As with HIV/AIDS seafarers' experiences, fishermen often go very far
and away from home and they can further spread _Vibrio_ infections.

Sabah, a state in East Malaysia, is confirmed to be the 2nd state in
the country to have recorded a cholera outbreak, a Malaysian official
said on Mon 23 Nov 2009. There were 18 cases reported in the state,
said Malaysian deputy health minister Rosnah Abdul Rashid Shirlin
after launching the Second International Conference on Rural Medicine
2009 at KotaKinabalu, Sabah's state capital.

While 2 states in Malaysia had reported cholera cases, Rosnahsaid the
ones in Terengganu, an eastern state in Malaysian peninsula, were
caused by different bacterial strains, requiring different
antimicrobial agents for treatment.

Noting that the situation in Sabah State was under control, Rosnah
advised the public to look after their health and hygiene, and to be
careful when handling food.

The 1st cholera case in the recent outbreak was reported on 11 Nov
[2009] at Kuala Terengganu, the state capital of Terengganu State and
as of Sunday [22 Nov 2009], a total of 185 confirmed cases were
reported in the state.

The outbreak of cholera in Terengganu which was first reported on 11
Nov 2009, has now recorded 174 cases with 1 death. Health minister
Datuk Seri Liow Tiong Lai said 116 cholera cases detected from 451
patients being treated for diarrhoea in hospitals while 56 cases were
contact cases involving 1074 people.

He said the disease spread through contaminated food and drinks
because of unhygienic food handling. He said, as for preventive and
control measures, the Terengganu health department had inspected 65
premises with 12 premises, including an ice factory, ordered to close
because of unsatisfactory cleanliness.

36 wells had been chlorinated and 304 toilets and garbage disposal
areas disinfected, he said, adding that the outbreak in Terenagganu
this time involved a strain that some antimicrobial agents were
ineffective against it.

[4] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (East Sepik)

The East Sepik provincial administration and health authorities
confirmed the outbreak in Angoram district. In a statement released
on 19 Nov 2009, provincial administrator Samson Torovi said more than
90 people had been confirmed with cholera with 5 people having died
from it. The update superseded the figures released by Wewak General
Hospital chief executive officer Dr Louis Samiak in the morning,
which stood at 70 confirmed cases and 3 deaths.

The worst affected areas are Kambaramba village, the Biwat area,
Angoram town, and the Gavien Resettlement area. Mr Torovi said people
from these areas were frequent travelers to Madang province via the
Sepik River and they may have contracted the disease there.

A cholera outbreak was declared in Madang 4 weeks ago, and the number
of people suspected to be infected there has risen to 400, with 10
confirmed cases.

Dr Samiak said samples of all reported cases were flown to Port
Moresby for laboratory testing by a surveillance officer and the
results were expected to be made known later.

Cholera was first reported in Morobe province in August 2009, where
an outbreak was declared. Some deaths in Eastern Highlands and Gulf
provinces were linked to the disease, but not confirmed. It spread to
Madang, where an outbreak was declared in October 2009, and now to
East Sepik.

The government has contained the outbreak of cholera at the Kamiti
Maximum Prison, which left 10 inmates dead and scores hospitalized,
vice president Kalonzo Musyoka has said.

the cause of the epidemic, adding that it was suspected the disease
was introduced into the facility by a new inmate, who had contracted
it from one of the affected estates in Nairobi.
