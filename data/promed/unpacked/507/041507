Even as China is struggling to contain the bird-flu-causing H5N1
virus, it reported an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) among
its cattle. Around 91 cattle had to be slaughtered in the Asian
country due to the disease, the Chinese agriculture ministry has said.
The latest outbreak was reported in eastern Shandong Province and is
believed to have begun on 6 Dec 2005.
The Shandong outbreak is the only one that has been reported. But
according to sources, the disease has reared its head near Beijing
and in Hebei, Jiangsu, and Xinjiang provinces also. [China officially
reported the occurrence of FMD, serotypes Asia 1, in the said 3
provincial regions earlier in 2005; see further. - Mod. AS]
Earlier in April-May 2005, a number of outbreaks of Asian type 1 FMD
were reported in 5 provincial regions, leading to the killing of 4000
cattle all over the country. [These provincial regions were: Beijing,
its neighboring province of Hebei, eastern China's Shandong and
Jiangsu provinces, and northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

[China's Veterinary Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture has sent OIE a
timely official notification on the current Shandong outbreak, namely
on Fri 30 Dec 2005, a day after its laboratory confirmation (see
<http://www.oie.int/Messages/060102CHN.htm>).
Confirmation, or otherwise, of the recurrence of FMD in the other
provincial regions will help. - Mod.AS]
