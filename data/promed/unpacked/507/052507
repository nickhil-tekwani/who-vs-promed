Nigeria suspects that illegal poultry imports were to blame for introducing
deadly bird flu to Africa's most populous country, the information minister
said on Thursday. The virus known as H5N1 has spread to 7 of the country's
36 states and the capital city since it was first detected in northern
Nigeria on 8 Feb, but 90 per cent of infected farms bought day-old chicks
from one farm in Kano state, minister Frank Nweke said.
"There is a very strong basis to believe that avian flu may have been
introduced into Nigeria through illegally imported day-old chicks," he
said. "Further investigations into the activities of farms where birds have
tested positive to the highly pathogenic avian flu revealed that 90 per
cent of them patronised the Sovet Farms Ltd in Kano."
Customs agents impounded almost 200 smuggled cartons of hatching eggs at
the country's main international airport in Lagos in January 2006, he added.
Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello had originally blamed illegal imports for
the bird flu outbreak, which has led to the destruction of 450 000 birds
and deaths of thousands more, but he later pointed to migrating wild birds
as the source.
Niger, an impoverished, landlocked country which borders Nigeria to the
north, has also found the deadly bird flu in poultry, and Nweke said
Nigeria would send experts next week to help deal with the outbreak there.
Experts want to determine how the virus entered Nigeria, the first
infection in the world's poorest continent, to better stop it spreading
further. Many African countries have already slapped import bans on
Nigerian poultry.
Nigerian authorities have imposed quarantines on infected farms and ordered
culling, but the measures have been only partially observed on the ground.
Nweke said the government would begin paying compensation to farmers
affected by culling on Monday.
The government knows of no humans in Nigeria infected with the virus, which
has been spreading west from Asia for 3 years and has killed 94 people in 7
countries.
UN Food and Agriculture Organisation experts have said that, unless it can
be controlled, the H5N1 outbreak in Nigeria could cause a regional
disaster. They say that Africa, the world's poorest continent, where
millions live with domestic poultry in their homes and backyards, is
ill-equipped in terms of health resources and funds to combat the disease.

[How to tease fate: make a decision. We had decided to discontinue this
thread because the reports were getting frankly repetitive, and then this
report emerged of some illuminating epidemiologic investigations in
Nigeria. To turn the hypothesis on the dangers of infected imported birds
into a theory needs repeated similar examples elsewhere -- but for the
moment it is not so speculative. - Mod.MHJ]
