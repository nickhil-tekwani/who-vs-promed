Veterinary and sanitary physicians from the Vologodskaya region are still
searching for the burial sites of cattle [that] died from anthrax. Of 145
graveyards, only half have been located so far.
Last week a special investigative committee from the state epidemiological
surveillance center and veterinary service was organized; the committee has
already evaluated 3 areas. So far no new graveyards were identified. The
old fences and signs from previously identified graveyards were repaired.
The work on these grave sites will continue until the end of 2004.

I have the addresses of 515 anthrax sites in the Vologodskaya oblast
registered during the 20th century. During the decade [1994-2004], none of
them has shown disease activity.

[Beniyamin has constructed an invaluable register of all known Russian
anthrax outbreaks during the 20th century. That new cases in the past
decade have not been noted in relation to these previous sites in the
oblast is a comfort. But this is not to say that an unknown proportion
might still contain viable _Bacillus anthracis_ spores. As these grave
sites are ploughed up and otherwise disturbed, we might see new cases --
note the difference in oblast numbers. If there are adequate numbers of
spores, infections will be seen in subsequently grazing livestock. As this
time there are no hard data on the percentage of Russian cattle grave sites
with contaminated soil. - Mod.MHJ]
