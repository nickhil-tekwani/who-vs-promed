According to the previous article on dengue in Singapore, 980704233255,
there was a death of a Chinese construction worker. However, a new article
on Nov. 6 said, "No one has died from the disease so far this year".
Could someone tell me if the government of Singapore only counts
Singaporians in their statistics?
