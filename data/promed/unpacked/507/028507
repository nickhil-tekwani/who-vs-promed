At least 7 persons suffered from anthrax after they handled the meat
of an affected bull at Domkol in Murshidabad district.

A total of 8 cattle have died and several other livestock have been
found to suffer from anthrax at Shibnagar village where the locals
ate the meat of the affected bull, officials said.

Deputy Director of Animal Husbandry Kamdeb Sardar said the disease
spread to the villagers who handled the meat of the affected cattle.
Infection occurred to them during handling of the affected meat as
the anthrax bacteria came in contact with a cut or abrasion in the
skin, he said.

Officials have reached the area and the cattle and people were
vaccinated of anthrax bacteria, Sardar said.

[India rarely vaccinates humans against anthrax so I think we can
presume that just the cattle were vaccinated and the people received
antibiotics. While this account mentions people eating the
contaminated meat the 'scientific' explanation, given I suspect by Dr
Sardar, is more typical of cutaneous anthrax.
