103 more _E. coli_ cases reported to state
-----------------------------------------
An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 infections, linked to October 2004's NC state
fair, may be larger than previously thought, with more than 100 additional
cases under review, health officials said on Sat 6 Nov 2004.
The number of confirmed infections grew to 31 by Sat 6 Nov 2004, and the
Department of Health and Human Services was investigating 103 more cases.
Department spokesman Bill Furney attributed the additional reports to
heightened awareness among doctors and the public.
The most common link among victims is that some of them visited a petting
zoo at the fair. Many children were infected.

[Given the usual incubation period for this infection (8 days or less), and
the fair ending on 24 Oct 2004, the increase in cases is most likely due to
an increase in retrospective recognition of cases and not from new primary
infections related to the fair, although secondary cases in a household may
still occur, since excretion of the bacillus in the stool of infected
children can be seen for as long as 3 weeks. - Mod.LL]
