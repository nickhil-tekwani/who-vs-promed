The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) in New Zealand has extended a public health warning against collecting shellfish in the Northland east coast region due to a reported illness.

The affected area now covers from North Cape (Outo) south to Cape Karikari (Whakapouaka) and includes Parengarenga, Houhoura and Rangaunu Harbours.

One illness was noted in someone who consumed shellfish collected from Rarawa Beach. MPI is sampling and testing shellfish from this region. Results have shown levels of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) toxins above the limit of 0.8 mg/kg set by the agency.

Mussels, oysters, tuatua, pipi, toheroa, cockles, scallops, catseyes, kina (sea urchin) and all other bivalve shellfish should not be eaten, and cooking shellfish does not remove the toxin.

Symptoms typically appear between 10 minutes and 3 hours after ingestion and may include numbness and a tingling (prickly feeling) around the mouth, face, and hands and feet, difficulty swallowing or breathing, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, paralysis and respiratory failure.

[Paralytic shellfish poison (PSP) is a naturally occurring marine biotoxin that is produced by some species of microscopic algae. Shellfish eat these algae and can retain the toxin. People can become ill from eating shellfish contaminated with PSP. This biotoxin affects the nervous system and paralyzes muscles, thus the term "paralytic" shellfish poison. High levels of PSP can cause severe illness and death.

Shellfish are filter feeders. They pump water through their systems, filtering out and eating algae and other food particles. When shellfish eat biotoxin producing algae, the biotoxin can accumulate in their tissue.

Bivalve molluscan shellfish such as clams, mussels, oysters, geoduck, and scallops can accumulate PSP. So can moon snails and other gastropods. Other marine species, such as sea cucumbers, might be affected. Crab, because they feed on shellfish, can also become toxic.

It's normal for biotoxin producing algae to be present in marine water. They are usually in low numbers that cause no problems. But when the algae "blooms," the levels of biotoxin-producing algae can increase. The increased algae become a greater food source for shellfish. The more algae the shellfish eat, the more biotoxin they accumulate. Biotoxins don't harm shellfish, so the level in their tissue will rise until the bloom subsides. When the number of toxin-producing algal cells returns to normal low levels, the shellfish eventually flush the toxin from their bodies. It can be several days to several months or longer before they're safe to eat again.
