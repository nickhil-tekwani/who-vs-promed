A comment on organ donation policy
----------------------------------
I suggest that, to decrease the risk of this happening again, one of the
questions that should be asked before organs are harvested for transplant
is whether the potential donor has traveled in a rabies endemic country
within the last 3 to 6 months. This is unlikely to reduce the donor pool by
much and should prevent this type of unfortunate occurrence. This is not
meant as any sort of criticism of what has happened in Germany but is
intended simply to be a suggestion for a sensible precaution against
something that has now happened several times in several countries.

Rabies in transplant organ recipients: more information is needed about
infectious diseases and organ transplantation
-----------------------------------------------
Recently in Germany, a number of organ recipients were infected with rabies
from an organ donor. Many in the press and elsewhere have been quick to
blame the medical community for overlooking potential warning signs, yet
this case also raises more general questions about the principles that are
now commonly used in selecting organ donors, specifically with respect to
infectious diseases (and neurological symptoms).
According to several [sources], the organ donor, a 26 year old female,
showed signs of systemic infection before her death. Her trip to India --
where the donor most likely acquired the infection -- in October 2004, was
known as well. This information was released by Prof Dr P Galle, leading
physician of the Internal Medical Clinic at the University Clinics of
Mainz, Germany, who treated the patient before her death. Furthermore, it
was released in German newspapers that the patient contacted at least 3
hospitals because of her "mysterious" illness in the last weeks before her
death. This included neurology (because of severe headache) and psychiatry
(because of aggressive/bizarre behavior).
Various clinicians and health officials have claimed that this case is an
example of a "scientific gap," as there is "no fast test for rabies." While
such claims may be strictly correct, [they] are also effectively
exculpatory, suggesting that cases such as this recent case in Germany are
perhaps unavoidable, even fated. It seems to me, however, that this case
raises questions about our general organ donation principles that could
benefit from further discussion.

[In addition, Dr Brockmann posed some specific questions that have been
edited out. The issues raised by Drs Honhold and Brockmann are highly
relevant to those working in the field of organ transplantation, but they
are too broad for discussion in ProMED-mail and do not relate specifically
to the rabies transmission incident described in Germany (and earlier in
the United States). Those interested in developing this discussion should
direct their comments to organ transplantation societies, such as the DSQ
(Deutsche Stifung Organtransplantation) in Germany, and other national
societies. Therefore, this thread is now cut. - Mod.CP]
