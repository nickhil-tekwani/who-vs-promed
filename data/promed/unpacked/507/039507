Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: There were notifications of suspected FMD
cases from farms on 14 Dec 2010. They were proved as FMD positive on
15 Dec 2010. Cattle and pigs in the affected farms and within 500
meters around the affected farms have been culled and buried as a
preemptive measure.

Control measures:
Measures applied: Stamping out, Quarantine, Movement control inside
the country, Screening, Zoning, Disinfection of infected
premises/establishment(s), Vaccination prohibited.

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results [comment 3]
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Research and Quarantine
Service (NVRQS) (National laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 15 Dec 2010 / Positive
Cattle / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) /
15 Dec 2010 / Positive
Swine / enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) / 15 Dec 2010 / Positive
Swine / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) /
15 Dec 2010 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports
will be submitted.

[The above follow-up report, commendably submitted to the OIE on the
very day of laboratory diagnosis, confirms the data included in
ProMED-mail's earlier report (archived 20101215.4442) which addressed
the spread of FMD into a province more than 250 km distant from the
initial infected area. Outbreaks 1 and 2, in the newly infected
Gyeonggi-do province, are in fact No. 34 and No. 35 since the start of
the epizootic in late November 2010. Outbreak 3 has been recorded in
the already extensively infected North Gyeongsang province; it is, in
fact, No. 36. For a map with all 36 outbreaks, see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9993>.

The following points in the report deserve clarification, particularly
for subscribers who are not familiar with the epidemiology of
infectious animal diseases:

1. Date of start of the outbreak is given as 14 Dec 2010. This "start"
seems to stand, in reality, for the date of the 1st veterinary visit
to the suspected farm for clinical examination and sampling which led
to laboratory confirmation. The actual start of the outbreaks could,
in fact, have taken place earlier. Index FMD cases remain, usually,
undetected in "real time", farmers able to suspect a health problem,
and ideally call upon the vets, only when they discover disease signs
in more than a single animal, namely after at least one round of virus
circulation within the herd. In cattle, the incubation period varies
from 2 to 14 days, depending on the dose of the virus, its infectivity
and the route of infection. In pigs, the incubation period is usually
2 days or more, but can be as short as 18-24 hours. Thus, when 1st
cases are detected, in most cases the virus had already been
circulating within the herd/farm for at least a week, and in many
cases considerably longer. The
determination of the actual start of the outbreak is important for
epidemiological and disease control considerations, since all contacts
which had taken place with other farms/animals since the introduction
of the virus should be discovered, and so that actions can be taken.
This is why veterinarians, engaged in the control of infectious
diseases of farm animals, are trained to estimate the age of FMD
lesions in the various species.

2. The number of cases and susceptible animals, as indicated in the
notification, is 2/1200 (pigs), 1/1200 (pigs), and 1/146 (cattle),
respectively in outbreaks 1, 2 and 3. A higher number of cases is
expected on farms with a fully susceptible animal population exposed
to an FMD virus strain with demonstrated high infectivity. The
consequently calculated "apparent morbidity rate" (0.68 percent in
cattle, 0.13 percent in pigs) is astonishingly low. Was "number of
cases" actually the number of "sampled animals"?

3. The diagnostic tests performed were ELISA and RT-PCR, leading to
the identification of FMD virus (FMDV) serotype O. The genotyping of
the virus is also of importance; the FMDV strain which caused the
previous epizootic in S. Korea, April - June 2010 as well as the major
Japanese epizootic April - July 2010 and recent outbreaks in other
Asian countries, such as the current Mongolian epizootic, was
identified as topotype SEA, strain Mya-98.

Could the S. Korean authorities provide the profiles of the current virus
strains for each of the 2 provinces infected? - Mod.AS]
