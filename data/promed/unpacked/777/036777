Nationwide outbreak of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype 4,[5],12:I:- infection associated with consumption of dried pork sausage, France, November-December 2011
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Gossner CM, van Cauteren D, Le Hello S, et al]

On 7 Dec 2011, the National Reference Centre for _Salmonella_ (NRC) alerted the French Public Health Institute (InVS) about a 2-fold increase of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype 4,[5],12:i:- since the 1st week of November 2011. Between 31 Oct 2011 and 18 Dec 2011 (week 44 to week 50), a total of 337 cases were identified (Figure 1 [for figures, see source URL - Mod.LL]). The median age was 10 years (range: 0-90 years) with about 30 percent of children under 5. A majority of women were affected (female to male sex ratio: 1.22). Cases were reported throughout France (Figure 2).

An epidemic of _Salmonella enterica_ 4,[5],12:i:- was already observed about 3 months prior to this outbreak. Between 1 Aug 2011 and 9 Oct 2011, 682 cases were reported (Figure 1), of whom 100 cases were interviewed at the time but no common vehicle of infection could be identified. In comparison, 212 cases with this serotype had been isolated during the same period in 2010.

These 2 consecutive outbreaks appeared in a context of emergence of monophasic variants of _S._ Typhimurium all over Europe in humans, animals and food products (1,2). Surveillance data from the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety (Anses), showed that this 4,[5],12:i:- variant had been identified in multiple animal and food samples including pork and beef (3). While this serotype was rarely identified before the mid-1990s, it is now among the most reported _Salmonella_ serotype in the European Union (2,4-7, and personal communication, European Centre for Disease prevention and Control, 17 Jan 2011). In France, serotype 4,[5],12:i:- ranks 3rd among strains isolated from the pork industry (pork carcasses, pork meat and processed pork meat products ("charcuterie") in 2011.

An outbreak investigation team composed of experts from the InVS, NRC, Anses, and the French Directorate General for Food (DGAL) was set up and launched simultaneously epidemiological, microbiological, and food investigations to define the extend of the outbreak and identify the vehicle of transmission.

Epidemiological investigation
-----------------------------
A case was defined as a person resident in France, who had clinical sign of _Salmonella_ infection and for whom monophasic _S. enterica_ serotype 4,[5],12:i:- was isolated from blood, stool or urine samples after week 44, that is, from 31 Oct to 18 Dec 2011 and received at the NRC. In the defined period, 337 cases were identified. We interviewed 90 cases (or the parents for the children) by telephone with a standardised semi-structured questionnaire. The interviews were conducted between 7 and 21 Dec 2011. Date of onset of these cases ranged from 25 Sep (week 38) to 8 Dec (week 49) 2011. The 1st 62 cases were interviewed with a trawling questionnaire covering travel history, contact with other diarrhea cases, and food consumption during the 7 days prior to symptoms onset. From 14 Dec onwards, interviews of the 28 most recent cases were undertaken with a lighter version of the questionnaire focusing on consumption and place of purchase of pork delicatessen.

During the interviews of the 1st 62 cases, 53 cases (84 percent) reported eating cooked ham, 45 cases (73 percent) Emmental cheese, 42 cases (68 percent) dried pork sausages, 42 cases (68 percent) chicken, 38 cases (60 percent) minced beef, and 38 cases (60 percent) eggs. Dried pork sausages were the only food item that appeared to have been consumed more frequently than expected.

In total, 87 of 90 of the cases reported eating pork delicatessen and the most common items consumed were cooked ham (74 cases, 82 percent) and dried pork sausage (58 cases, 65 percent). In addition, 42 interviewed cases (47 percent) reported buying pork delicatessen at supermarket chain A, and 18 cases (22 percent), 16 cases (18 percent), and 14 (16 percent) at supermarket chain B, C, and D, respectively. These results are not exclusive as about 33 percent of the supermarket chain B's clients are also clients of supermarket chain A.

Health authorities of the European Union were first alerted on 9 Dec 2011 and regularly updated through the Epidemic Intelligence Information System (EPIS) and the Early Warning Response System (EWRS) of the European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). As of 16 Jan 2012, no other European country has reported an excess of _Salmonella enterica_ serotype 4,[5],12:i:- in November and December 2011.

Microbiological investigation
-----------------------------
The NRC performed subtyping on a selection of 129 monophasic variants with serotype 4,[5],12:i:- isolated from cases between 2 Nov and 5 Dec 2011.

PulseNet-standardised XbaI pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) (9) multilocus variable number of tandem repeats analysis (MLVA) subtyping (10) and molecular typing based on the CRISPR [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats] polymorphisms (Crispol subtyping) (11) revealed a major profile among the epidemic isolates. It was characterised by a XTYM-159 PFGE pattern (found on 12 of 13 tested strains), a 3-13-9-NA-211 MLVA profile (9 of 9 tested strains), and a Crispol type 1 (87 of 129 tested strains). The antibiotic resistance ASSulTe (resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, sulphonamide, and tetracycline) was found on all 33 tested strains. Those profiles are currently predominant in France, and it was therefore not possible to distinguish with certainty between epidemic and non-epidemic cases.

Food investigation and trace-back
---------------------------------
Loyalty cards: epidemiological investigations pointed to a dried pork sausage purchased principally at supermarket chain A and consumed after week 44 [31 Oct-6 Nov] 2011. Therefore purchases of pork delicatessen at supermarkets A and B up to 4 weeks prior to symptom onset were investigated by the DGAL using data recorded through supermarket loyalty cards.

Among the 90 interviewed cases, 39 provided the number of their loyalty card for supermarket chain A during the interview. For 17 cases no purchases of dried pork sausage could be found. Of the 22 cases with documented purchase of dried pork sausage, 15 had bought sausage from a French producer X and the remaining 7 cases bought sausages of 7 different brands and origins from other producers. Dried pork sausages from producer X represented less than 3 percent of supermarket chain A's sales for this type of food item.

A total of 11 loyalty cards from supermarket chain B were collected. However, the supermarkets of chain B buy products individually rather than centrally for the whole chain, and the products are therefore not coded in the central database and cannot be traced through the loyalty card data.

Investigation at producer X
---------------------------
45 lots of the pork sausage (one lot=8000 sausages) had been produced between 1 Sep and 15 Dec 2011. Between 1 Oct and 15 Dec 2011, 80 to 100 percent of the sausages were distributed to supermarket chain A. The remaining lots were distributed to other supermarket chains including chain B and others used by the cases.

As of 15 Dec 2011, the producer's own checks on raw materials and final products as well as food inspection done during the outbreak investigation of 43 samples (25 g per sausage per lot) of dried pork sausages produced between 24 Aug and 21 Nov 2011 resulted negative for _Salmonella_.

The sausages had been distributed nationwide in metropolitan France, the French department of La Reunion, the French overseas territories of Saint Pierre and Miquelon and French Polynesia, and also in Maurice Island. In addition, there was secondary distribution by supermarket chain A to Poland, Portugal, and Slovenia.

Discussion
----------
We describe a nationwide outbreak of salmonellosis involving 337 identified cases of infection with the _Salmonella enterica_ serotype 4,[5],12:i:- between 31 Oct 2011 and 18 Dec 2011. The investigation indicated dried pork sausage from producer X as being the most likely source of the outbreak.

The incrimination of the dried sausage was supported by the following findings: Firstly, an unusually high proportion of the interviewed cases reported having eaten dried sausage. Secondly, the proportion of cases that had bought pork delicatessen in supermarket chain A was much higher than the market share of this supermarket chain among the different supermarket chains in France. Thirdly, according to loyalty card records from supermarket chain A, around 68 percent of the cases' purchases of sausages were sausages from producer X. However producer X's sausages represent less than 3 percent of the sausages market share at supermarket chain A. This discrepancy makes it likely that the vehicle of infection was dried pork sausage from producer X. Finally, the fact that more than half of the production of producer X is sold through supermarket chain A explains the high proportion of cases that purchased dried pork sausage at supermarket chain A.

Public health measures were implemented on 16 Dec 2011: The DGAL ordered a withdrawal and a recall with a press release and posters, which applied to all supermarkets distributing the incriminated sausage. As accurate identification of suspect lots was not possible, the withdrawal/recall applied to all lots put on the market between 1 Oct and 15 Dec 2011, considering the 3 months of shelf life of the product. To be released on the market, newly produced lots had to pass a reinforced sampling plan and a clearance monitoring. Countries that received those sausages from producer X or via the supermarket chains were informed on 20 and 23 Dec 2011 through the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF).

The use of the loyalty card from supermarket chain A was important to identify the vehicle of infection and the local producer involved in this outbreak. These cards are used more and more and prove helpful in the investigation of food-related outbreaks. Nevertheless we should keep in mind that they do not necessarily reflect the consumption of cases perfectly. For instance, the card may not be used systematically, the household can purchase foods in additional shops and markets for which they have no loyalty cards, many food products are consumed outside the household and not recorded on the card, and the central database of the supermarket does not always contain data on all foods sold such as foods directly purchased by the retailers. For these reasons the data have to be interpreted together with the results from epidemiological and microbiological investigations.

That the producer and microbiological analysis did not find _Salmonella_ does not exclude contamination. The limited number of samples and the processing of the food (especially salting and drying) reduce the likelihood of isolating the bacteria. Implementing checks earlier in the process (before salting and drying) and using additional methods of testing such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be considered.

The outbreak strain was the most common genotype of _S. enterica_ serotype 4,[5],12:i:-. The low diversity of genotypes among this serotype did not allow a more specific case definition with the techniques used.

In this investigation we focused efforts on descriptive epidemiology and detailed trace-back data from loyalty cards. A case control study was not performed because such a study may have shown an association with sausage, but would not have contributed to the identification of the brand name necessary to take control measures.

Conclusion
----------
Considering the epidemiological investigation and trace back results suggesting a link between _S. enterica_ 4,[5],12:i:- infection and consumption of dried pork sausages from producer X, and despite the absence of positive sampling results on the sausages, control measures including withdrawal/recall were implemented. The epidemic peak has passed and the number of cases has been at the usual level since week 52 2011.

Monophasic _S. enterica_ variants are becoming predominant in the European Union (2,4-7 and personal communication, European Centre for Disease prevention and Control, 17 Jan 2011) and are increasingly reported in humans, animals, and food samples. This is the 2nd described outbreak in France involving dried pork sausage, and indicates that this food item might be a likely vehicle of infection and further outbreaks in humans may be expected (12).

Given the limitations to detect _Salmonella_ in dried sausages, the ability of the standard reference method to detect of monophasic variant strains in dried sausages is questionable. Additional methods should be explored in order to improve monitoring protocols.

[The designation _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- means:
- the "I" reflects subspecies _enterica_;
- the "4, [5], 12" are the O (or somatic) antigens associated with the organism. It should be noted that serotype Typhimurium carries somatic antigens 4, 5, and 12 (the group B antigens). Paccagnella [author of the 2005 book "Naming Salmonella"]
pointed out to me in an email that an O antigen underscored or placed in [ ] can refer to whether the antigen is related to phage conversion or not.
- the nomenclature after the colon, in this case i:-, reflects the flagellar or H antigens. It is these H antigens that define the serotype identity within an individual group of salmonellae.

Almost all of these organisms are biphasic in regard to the H antigens, that is, they can switch from one flagellar antigen to another. As an example, _S._ Typhimurium is I 4, 5, 12:i:1,2. The outbreak organism here, however, is monophasic. Echeita and colleagues (1) have found that this monophasic strain appears to be such due to the absence of the _fljB_ gene, which is involved in the H antigen switching mechanism. According to Paccagnella, around 1903 Smith and Reagh reported on the different behavior of the flagellar and somatic antigens of salmonella strains. Their work was mostly ignored until Weil and Felix, working on _Proteus_ cultures, noted 2 forms, the swarming form called the H form (_mit Hauch_, in English: with breath) and the non-swarming form, called the O form (_ohne Hauch_, in English: without breath). The H form contained both O and H antigens (correctly termed the OH form). These parallels were transposed to the salmonella antigens.

If O antiserum is added to a culture motility is preserved, whereas if H antiserum is added the culture does not move. Therefore, H antigen was involved with swarming in the agar plate (breathing might have been used to imply the ability to move). (Salmonellae, of course, do not swarm on certain agar plates like _Proteus_ bacteria do.)

Several other foodborne outbreaks related to 4, 5, 12:i:- salmonellae have been reported including one in New York City reported in 2002 (2). Additional information about this monophasic organism, which may be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents, can be found in references 3-5.
