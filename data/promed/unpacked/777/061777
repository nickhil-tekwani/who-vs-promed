Cattle ranchers in the area are on alert for a possible outbreak of a disease known as [bovine] paralytic rabies, that during this past weekend caused the deaths of 23 animals in the Santa Gertrudis ranch in this municipality.

With this occurrence, the delegate to the Cattlemen's Union, Pedro Godoy Andrade, commented that communications were filed with the state authorities to activate preventive measures and avoid infection of 6000 head of cattle.

The area involved is the Santa Gertrudis ejido, where the deaths of 23 head of cattle are reported, that is located along the boundaries of the Mariano Matamoros and San Antonio ejidos, where there is concern that the disease will spread. [Ejidos are communially owned lands in Mexico, usually around villages, that may have agricultural operations by individuals or cooperatives. - Mod. TY].

Godoy Andrade explained that bovine paralytic rabies is present regularly during the months of March, April and May, which is when temperatures are most warm, a condition that is atypical [for the rest of the year]. He said that he suspects that the infection is produced through the bite of a bat, and to confirm this version [of transmission] nets are placed to catch them and carry out corresponding studies. He anticipated that this version [of transmission] will be confirmed, and envisions the need to implement a fence [barrier?] at least 10 km [ 6 mi] around, with the result that around 7 ejidos and ranches.

Meanwhile, the cattlemen are obtaining vaccine to protect the cattle that sill show no signs, as well as anticipate the request for help from the state authorities in case they are unable to achieve control of the disease.

[The report goes on to indicate that recent rains have broken a drought of several months and that pastures are becoming green again, providing forage for their animals].

[The virus causing bovine paralytic rabies is transmitted by _Desmodus rotundus_, the most common vampire bat in the tropic Americas. The fence referred to above is probably a vampire bat control barrier effort utilizing mist nets for bat capture and application of anticoagulant jelly (warfarin or related compounds) that the bats and their roost mates ingest through mutual grooming. There is no indication about the period of time over which the 23 cattle deaths occurred. If the cases all occurred in a week or 2, it would not be surprising if additional animals died of paralytic rabies in coming days. Vampire bat transmitted rabies is not unusual across Mexico, and it is surprising that ranchers and other owners of cattle and equine animals do not routinely vaccinate their animals against rabies. The obvious bat bites on cattle and equine animals are an easily observed indicator that vampire bats are present in the area and a warning that rabies vaccination is needed.
