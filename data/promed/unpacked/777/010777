[Koi herpesvirus disease (KHD) is caused by a herpesvirus capable of inducing a contagious and acute viraemia in common carp (_Cyprinus carpio_) including carp ornamental varieties such as koi carp and ghost carp. KHD was first recorded in Israel in 1988, later found in Europe and the USA, and have subsequently been reported throughout the world. In Europe, the virus has caused increasing numbers of mortalities in angling waters as well as in ornamental dealers and hobbyists fish stocks.

The disease is transmitted by fish to fish contact and it is also possible that the disease can spread through contaminated water, nets and other equipment. The virus is thought to be shed through faeces, and urine, and also possibly via gills and skin. KHV may have the capacity to remain latent in its host for long periods of time before becoming active, stress is often the 'trigger' before an outbreak of the disease.

The disease was added to the OIE list in 2007; previously, it was reported to the OIE as a (non-listed) 'emerging disease' (by Singapore, 2005).

Referring to KHV's history: interestingly, PCR testing of archived samples of an earlier unexplained mass mortality of koi and common carp in the UK confirmed that KHV was already present there as early as 1996 (Denham, K. 2003. Koi herpesvirus in wild fish. Veterinary Record 153:507)

More information on KHD is found in OIE Aquatic Manual chapter (2009 update), which is available at:
