China confirmed on Monday [16 Jan 2006] outbreaks of foot and mouth disease
[FMD] in north west China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and eastern
China's Jiangsu Province.
2 head of cattle raised by a farmer in Xuanhe Town, Zhongwei City in the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region showed the symptom of gum cankering, tongue
blister on 4 Jan 2006, with one dead the next day, the Ministry of
Agriculture's website said on Monday.
The initial tests by the region's veterinary authorities indicated that
this is a suspected case of the Asia 1 strain of FMD. The National FMD Lab
confirmed the case on 14 Jan 2006, the ministry said. 89 head of cattle and
110 sheep have been culled in the vicinity of the outbreak in the region to
guard against the spread of the disease, said the ministry.
In a farm in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, 20 cows were found to have the
symptom of salivation on 11 Jan 2006, suspected [to be cases of the] Asia 1
strain of FMD by provincial veterinary authorities and confirmed by the
National FMD Lab 16 Jan 2006, according to the ministry. 100 head of cattle
have been killed in the region.
The outbreaks have been brought under control, said the ministry, adding
that the areas around the 2 outbreaks have been sealed off and disinfected.
The ministry also ordered the emergency vaccination of all susceptible
animals in the vicinity of the outbreaks.

[FMD is a non-zoonotic, highly infectious disease which may cause heavy
economic losses, mainly due to its rapid spread and debilitating impact
upon cattle, small ruminants and pigs. The FMD situation in China is of
concern to its own farming industry and to its neighbour countries. It is
also a threat to other parts of the globe. See the Food and Agriculture
Organisation's review, June 2005 (20050624.1774).
According to China's reports to the OIE, not a single outbreak of FMD was
recorded there between May 1999 and the end of 2004. In contrast, during
2005, the Chinese veterinary services sent the OIE 6 reports on FMD,
serotype Asia 1, causing 10 outbreaks in 4 (out of China's 22) provinces, 1
out of China's 5 autonomous regions and 1 out of China's 4 major
municipalities. The affected provinces were (in brackets, number of
outbreaks): Shandong (2), Gansu (1), Qinghai (1), Hebei (2), Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region (2), Beijing municipality (1), and Jiangsu (1).
The Chinese claim to have applied the following FMD control activities:
stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening;
zoning; vaccination; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s);
dipping/spraying.
It seems that FMD serotype Asia 1 has become, or remains, endemic in China.
In light of the recent outbreaks in Russia -- along its borders with north
eastern China -- it may be assumed that the disease is present in the
adjacent Heilongjiang province, and probably Jilin as well. It is
encouraging to note, since 2005, the first signs of improved surveillance
and/or reporting and/or transparency. - Mod.AS]
