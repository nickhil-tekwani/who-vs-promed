A beauty cream manufactured in Mexico caused mercury poisoning in consumers
and their family members in Texas and Arizona, according to a report. The
contaminated cream, called Crema de Belleza Manning, prompted a statewide
health investigation in Arizona and highlights the potential hazards of
purchasing certain products abroad, researchers report in the January issue
of the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.
"Although this product has reportedly been removed from the market, other
mercurial products continue to be available in other countries," write Dr.
Cheryl McRill, of the Arizona Department of Health Services, and
colleagues. Mercury, a highly poisonous metallic element, can enter the
body through the skin, mouth, or by inhalation.
Of 89 people who contacted the Arizona Department of Health Services about
possible exposure, 66 were found to have elevated mercury levels -- an
average of eight times higher than the level that is considered safe,
according to the report. Fifty-five of those people were evaluated in a
health clinic, including two spouses and six children of cream users. The
family members had not used the cream themselves, but may have inhaled the
mercury.
Although none had any major problems such as gastrointestinal or central
nervous system disorders, many had early symptoms of mercury poisoning,
including headaches, weakness, mood changes, and dizziness.
Mercury levels decreased once patients stopped using the cream, but average
levels remained high even months after they stopped using the cream, the
investigators found.
"Public health authorities and clinicians should remain alert to the
potential risk of similar exposures in the future," McRill and colleagues
write.
According to the report, the cream contained 6%-10% calomel, or mercurous
chloride. While the skin does not easily absorb this form of mercury,
sunlight and heat can cause mercurous chloride to break down into forms
that are readily absorbed, the authors explain.
They add that there is no way to know how many Mexicans have used the
product.
