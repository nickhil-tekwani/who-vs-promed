[1] Hong Kong CHP report

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) confirmed a case of human influenza
A (H5N1) infection on 17 Nov 2010 affecting a 59 year old woman living in
Tuen Mun. She had enjoyed good health previously. She presented with a
runny nose since 2 Nov 2010, and fever and cough with blood streaked sputum
since 5 Nov 2010. She consulted doctors, and medications were given. Her
symptoms persisted, and she attended the Accident and Emergency Department
of Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH) on 12 Nov 2010, and chest X-ray (CXR) showed
left middle zone haziness.

She was given a course of Augmentin [amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid]. She
had increasing haemoptysis and persistent fever and was admitted to a
general ward in TMH on 14 Nov 2010. Her condition deteriorated, and CXR
taken on 16 Nov 2010 showed consolidation of her entire left lung field and
right lower zone haziness. She was then transferred to the intensive care
unit for close monitoring. She was treated with oseltamivir [Tamiflu] and
was given 100 per cent oxygen but did not require ventilatory support. She
is currently in a serious condition in Princess Margaret Hospital. Her
nasopharyngeal aspirate was tested positive for H5 influenza A virus by PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] on 17 Nov 2010.

She travelled to Mainland China (Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou) with her
husband and daughter from 23 Oct 2010 to 1 Nov 2010. She had history of
visiting a wet market in Mainland China during the incubation period but
had no history of direct contact with poultry or birds. She came back to
Hong Kong on 1 Nov 2010. The source of infection is being investigated.

Her 60 year old husband had a history of running nose and productive cough
but has recovered. Her close contacts have been put under quarantine.
Chemoprophylaxis was offered to close contacts, and tests on respiratory
specimens were negative.

In response to the confirmation of this case, the government has raised the
influenza response level from "Alert" Response Level to "Serious" Response
Level under the Framework of Government's Preparedness Plan for Influenza
Pandemic on the same day. CHP has also enhanced surveillance for avian
influenza, apart from the existing statutory notification system for
suspected Influenza A (H5, H7, and H9) cases.

Doctors are requested to refer patients fulfilling the following criteria
to the nearest accident and emergency department under the Hospital
Authority for further management:
- a person presented with influenza-like illness (fever over 38 C and
either sore throat or cough);
- and history of visiting wet market or contacting poultry in Shanghai,
Nanjing, or Hangzhou within the incubation period (that is, 7 days before
onset of symptoms).

This was the 1st confirmed human influenza A (H5N1) infection recorded in
Hong Kong since 2003. Previously, in 1997 and 2003, Hong Kong recorded 18
and 2 cases of human infections of H5N1 avian influenza, respectively. They
were 10 males and 10 females with ages ranging from 1 to 60 years. Ten were
children aged below 12 years. Seven of the cases died, and the others
recovered. The cases in 1997 coincided with an outbreak of high pathogenic
avian influenza caused by a virtually identical virus in poultry farms and
live markets, and the outbreak stopped after a mass culling operation. The
2 cases in 2003 were imported cases affecting a 33 year old man and his 9
year old son who had travelled to Mainland China.

According to the latest update from the World Health Organization (see map
at URL above) (18 Oct 2010), worldwide there have been so far a total of
507 confirmed cases (including 302 deaths) of human infection with the H5N1
avian influenza virus.

[2] WHO report
Date: Fri 19 Nov 2010

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH),
Hong Kong, China has reported a new confirmed human case of H5N1 infection
on Wed 17 Nov 2010. The case is a 59 year old woman. She developed symptoms
on Tue 2 Nov 2010 and was admitted to hospital on Sat 14 Nov 2010. She was
diagnosed with pneumonia and is now in a critical condition.

The case had a history of travel to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou. She
reported no history of contact with live birds and poultry in the days
before developing symptoms. Her close contacts are under surveillance and
are isolated. All remain asymptomatic to date. Nasopharyngeal aspirates of
all close contacts were negative for H5. Investigations into the source of
her infection are ongoing.

Evidence so far indicates a sporadic case of human influenza A(H5N1)
infection without secondary spread. So far, a total of 21 human cases of
influenza A (H5N1) infection were recorded in Hong Kong SAR China,
including 18 cases in 1997, 2 cases in 2003 and the current case in 2010.

[This is the WHO confirmation of the human case of avian influenza A/(H5N1)
virus infection in the Hong kong SAR. Essentially, there has been no
additional information since the release of this report and the CHP
statement. As of Mon 22 Nov 2010, there has been no confirmation of onward
transmission of infection, and the circumstances of the patient's exposure
to infection remain obscure. The patient remains alive.
