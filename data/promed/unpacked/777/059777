The following update was issued by KY State Veterinarian Rusty Ford on 26 Jan 2017:

Testing of samples collected on 25 Jan 2017 from horses in both barns has been completed and reported. The testing did identify a 2nd positive horse in the 1st barn, bringing the total EHV1 wild strain positive horses in that barn to 2. This most recent horse, a 3-year-old thoroughbred colt, was positive on nasal swab, negative on blood. The colt was moved from the barn to the secured isolation last night (25 Jan 2017).

Testing of horses in the 2nd barn did identify 3 horses -- all 2-year-old thoroughbred fillies -- to be EHV1 wild strain positive by PCR from the nasal swabs. Testing of whole blood samples from each horse did not detect evidence of EHV1. These additional positive horses were moved from the barn to the secured isolation earlier tonight.

Each of the 2 quarantined barns are secured; entry into the barns is restricted to essential personnel only, and biosecurity levels are implemented at the highest level. In addition to the affected barns, heightened biosecurity has been implemented in the entire barn area, which includes directing and restricting entrance into each barn, as well as requiring disinfecting upon entry and exit of each barn.

Designated times have been established for the horses from the quarantined barns to gain access to the track for exercise after normal training hours and after the general population of horses has returned to their barns.

Turfway Park:
The 2 positive horses identified and described on 24 Jan 2017 were moved offsite and are securely isolated on a private farm.

Monitoring of the general population continues with no evidence of further cases developing.

The previously established and described protocols for ship-ins, racing, training and monitoring remain in effect.

Oldham Premises I:
Testing of the barn's population of horses that had been exposed to EHV1 was completed yesterday (25 Jan 2017), with each horse testing negative on both nasal swabs and whole blood. Having been greater than 14 days post exposure, and each horse now having 2 negative sets (nasal and blood) of results, the Kentucky Office of State Veterinarian has released the quarantine imposed on 5 Jan 2017, and the horses are under no further restrictions.

Oldham Premises II:
Daily monitoring and assessment of the horses in the exposed quarantine barn continues with no evidence of further transmission of EHV1. Collection of samples (swabs and blood) from these horses has been scheduled to be completed next week to determine their eligibility to be released from restrictions as well.

[Race tracks are very communal places for horses and diseases. Diseases such as EHV are easily spread at racetrack facilities. There is always a ready supply of stressed horses, and diseases by nature are opportunistic. Taking the temperature of the horse twice a day is important, as fever may be earliest sign of this disease.
