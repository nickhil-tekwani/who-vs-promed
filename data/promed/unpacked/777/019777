According to an April [2015] surveillance report from China, 6 H7N9 avian flu illnesses were reported, 2 more than previously noted in earlier updates from individual provinces, according to an analysis of a report from the country's National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) by FluTrackers, an infectious disease news message board [https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links].

No details were available about the 2 cases. The other 4 cases FluTrackers had flagged for April 2015 in earlier reports included 2 from Anhui province and 1 each from Hubei and Jiangxi provinces. The NHFPC also reported 8 deaths from the disease in April [2015].

The additional cases lift the H7N9 total to 655 infections, according to a case list maintained by FluTrackers.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently noted that cases in China have dropped off over the past several weeks, but it added that sporadic cases are likely to be reported in the coming months in China and perhaps in neighboring countries.

[Cases of avian influenza A (H7N9) in humans were 1st reported in China in the spring of 2013. Most of these infections have been associated with contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments (such as poultry markets) in China. There is only rare evidence of human-to-human transmission. The virus is seasonal, and cases have been diminishing with the warmer weather.
