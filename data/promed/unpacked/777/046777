South Korea is culling thousands of pigs after confirming African swine fever [ASF] at a farm near its border with North Korea, which had an outbreak in May [2019].

Kim Hyun-soo, South Korea's agricultural minister, said the country's 1st case of the highly contagious disease was confirmed Tuesday [17 Sep 2019] in tests on 5 pigs that died Monday [16 Sep 2019] evening at the farm in the city of Paju.

Officials were planning to complete by Tuesday [17 Sep 2019] the culling of some 4000 pigs raised at the farm and 2 nearby farms run by the same owner. The government also strengthened efforts to disinfect farms and transport vehicles and ordered a 48-hour standstill on all pig farms, slaughterhouses, and feed factories across the country to prevent the spread of the disease, which threatens a massive industry that involves 6000 farms raising more than 11 million pigs.

ASF has decimated pig herds in China and other Asian countries before reaching the Koreas. It is harmless to people but for pigs is highly contagious and fatal. There is no known cure.

The outbreak in South Korea comes despite months of heightened monitoring efforts at border-area farms after the disease spread to North Korea. In May [2019], the North told the World Organization for Animal Health, or OIE, that 77 of the 99 pigs at a cooperative farm near its border with China died of the disease, and the remaining 22 pigs were culled.

South Korea's agriculture ministry said investigators were sent to the farm to trace the source of the outbreak, and it wasn't immediately clear if the disease would have crossed from North Korea.

North Korea has scaled back cooperation with South Korea after a summit between leader Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump collapsed in February [2019], and it has ignored repeated South Korean calls for joint efforts to stem the spread of the disease.

South Korea placed hundreds of fences and traps around border-area farms to prevent pigs from being infected by wild boars that roam in and out of North Korea, while the military used its heat sensors installed along the border to monitor the movement of the animals.

[The Republic of Korea has unfortunately become the 9th eastern Asia country infected by African swine fever. The others are as follows (the dates reported to the OIE as the start of the respective events are in parentheses): China (1 Aug 2018), Mongolia (9 Jan 2019), Viet Nam (1 Feb 2019), Cambodia (22 Mar 2019), North Korea (23 May 2019), Laos (2 Jun 2019), Myanmar (1 Aug 2019), and Philippines (25 Jul 2019; submitted report, 9 Sep 2019).

In addition, domestic swine and wild boar have been reported as infected from Asian parts of Russia, bordering northeast China. Globally, for all ASF outbreaks reported to the OIE since August 2018 (when China 1st notified its event), see the OIE interactive map at https://tinyurl.com/yy3k29gz (click on the cluster of interest, zoom in to the required resolution).

North Korea submitted its immediate notification on ASF on 30 May 2019, indicating "start of outbreak" as 23 May 2019 and date of confirmation as 25 May 2019; see with map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=30664. Since then, no follow-up reports or media/other information have become available from this country.

Hopefully, South Korea's alertness, intensive surveillance, and vigilance have allowed an early detection of the disease, leading to immediate control measures. How effective/successful? The coming days/weeks are expected to tell. - Mod.AS
