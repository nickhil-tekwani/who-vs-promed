WNV has been the cause of outbreaks and sporadic cases in central,
eastern and Mediterranean Europe for more than 45 years. In Italy,
the 1st cases of equine WNV infection were detected in 1998, but no
human cases were reported at that time. The 1st human cases of WNV
infection in Italy, including neuroinvasive forms, were identified in
2008. In 2009, to date [September 2009], 16 human cases of West Nile
neuroinvasive disease (WNND) have been reported in Italy, in 3
regions: Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Lombardy. The number of cases is
higher [in 2009] compared with last year [2008] when 9 cases were
identified (8 cases of WNND and one case of West Nile fever) and the
geographical distribution indicates spread from east to west.

[One wonders if the reappearance of West Nile virus cases in the same
general areas as last year (2008) is indicative that these northern
Italian regions are likely to have repeated outbreaks in the future.
