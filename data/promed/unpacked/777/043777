One more [outbreak] of anthrax has been confirmed in South Kazakhstan
oblast. As of 27 Jun 2011, there were 2 cases [outbreaks] of skin
anthrax in the region.

The specimens from a cow involved in the previous case have also
tested positive for anthrax. The last case was registered on 20 Jun
2011 when 3 people with suspected skin anthrax were hospitalized in
the infectious diseases ward. All possible contacts related to the
last outbreak are under observation.

[The only way to control this zoonosis is to ensure that livestock
cases do not occur. This necessitates regular vaccination of livestock
in areas with animal outbreaks. Retroactive vaccination following
human cases only finds a fraction of the livestock cases that are
occurring and in many ways is a waste of money, as it has minimal
impact on the livestock population at risk.
