3 Oregon residents were sickened presumably by _E. coli_ O157:H7 linked to
unpasteurized milk from Dee Creek Farm in Cowlitz County, WA, according to
public health officials in the Oregon Department of Human Services (DHS).
Earlier this week the same dairy was implicated as the source of _E. coli_
O157:H7 infection, which so far has sickened 8 individuals in Washington. 4
children remain in hospital, according to Emilio DeBess, DVM, public health
veterinarian in DHS.
The 3 Oregon cases are all members of the same family who drank milk from
the dairy and who all seem to be recovering. Laboratory testing is under
way and the investigation is continuing, according to DeBess. "Raw milk can
carry many germs, including _E. coli_ O157:H7, which can be one of the most
deadly," said DeBess. "It is far safer to drink pasteurized milk, which
delivers the same nutrients."
In 1993, 14 Oregonians became ill with _E. coli_ O157:H7; those cases were
traced to unpasteurized milk. In 1999, Oregon outlawed the retail sale of
raw milk, with an exception for farms with 3 or fewer cows; however they
cannot advertise and buyers must go to the farm to pick up the milk.

[_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 is just one of a number of infections that can
be transmitted to humans from unpasteurized milk or dairy products. These
include _Salmonella sp_ and _Campylobacter sp_, both of which may be
multi-drug resistant, as well as staphylococcal food poisoning, Q fever,
listeriosis, brucellosis, and bovine tuberculosis. In addition, Brainerd
diarrhea, a chronic diarrheal process of unknown etiology, is also
associated with raw milk ingestion.
All of the above infections are zoonoses, spread from animal to humans.
Shigellosis can also be spread by unpasteurized dairy products but is not a
zoonosis, except when related to primates. Since pasteurized milk has been
found not to transmit shigellosis, the contamination must occur prior to
pasteurization.
People who consume unpasteurized milk and milk products might believe that
these products taste better, provide greater nutrition than pasteurized
products, and/or decrease the risk for various medical conditions (1), but
the benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk and milk products have never
been validated scientifically (2).
