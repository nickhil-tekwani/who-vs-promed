A Presumptive Spongiform Encephalopathy in an Imported Zoo Felid
-------------
I am writing to advise of the presumptive diagnosis of a transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) in a zoo felid, a male Asiatic Golden Cat
born in 1992, which had been imported from a European zoo to the Melbourne
Zoo in 1998, and of the appropriate actions taken to ensure Australia
continues to be free from TSEs affecting farmed or wild animals.
The animal was found dead on 4 Mar 2002 with no premonitory signs apart from
an occasional lameness attributable to a healed carpal fracture. A
post-mortem was conducted by veterinarians at the Melbourne Zoo, with
findings indicating pancreatic disease and peritonitis as the causes of
death.
Routine histopathology was recently conducted on other tissues collected at
the post-mortem. Histopathological findings in this case included spongiform
changes in the white matter tracts of various parts of the brain. Referral
of fixed and fresh frozen tissues to the Australian Animal Health Laboratory
(AAHL) for further testing for TSE exclusion followed.
AAHL obtained positive test results by immunohistochemistry, electron
microscopy (for scrapie-associated fibrils), and by western blot. A
presumptive diagnosis of TSE has been made on the basis of these findings.
Samples of brain tissue from the affected animal will be sent to the OIE
world reference laboratory to confirm this diagnosis.
The history of this male Asiatic Golden Cat at Melbourne zoo is one
involving only short-duration contacts with an Australian-born female of the
same species (which remains alive and healthy), and a dietary regime
consisting exclusively of whole rabbits, chickens, and rats, and kangaroo
meat (all of Australian origin). As such, it is virtually certain that
exposure to TSE infectivity occurred at a time before the animal was
imported into Australia for zoo display.
As reported in Australia's technical submission to the OIE's FMD and Other
Epizooties Commission of July 2002, "Spongiform encephalopathy was diagnosed
in a cheetah in a zoological park in Western Australia in 1992. The cheetah
was born in Marwell Zoo in England in 1986, imported together with 2
littermates to Australia in 1989, and held in quarantine in an "A" class zoo
since importation. Marwell Zoo practised a 'feeding in' of culled carcasses
to other zoo animals, particularly felids and canids. The affected animal
and 2 siblings were euthanized."
I have initiated enquiries of counterpart Chief Veterinary Officers in the 2
European countries in which this zoo cat was previously held, with a view to
establishing possible sources of exposure to TSE infectivity. As an interim
precautionary measure, the in-contact female Asiatic Golden Cat has been
placed under conditions of lifetime quarantine at Melbourne Zoo.
Australia's active and passive surveillance systems for TSEs in animal
populations continue to confirm the absence of this group of diseases on a
country-wide basis. I trust this information is of use and assure you that
Australia will continue to report significant or unusual animal health
occurrences in accordance with its obligations as a member of the OIE.

MEDIA RELEASE
From the Department of Natural Resources and Environment, 29 Jul 2002
PROBABLE TSE CASE IN ZOO CAT
-------------------
An Asiatic Golden Cat that recently died of pancreatitis at Melbourne Zoo
has been found to have also had the rare brain disease, "transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy" or TSE.
Department of Natural Resources and Environment's (NRE) Chief Veterinary
Officer, Dr Hugh Millar, said the condition, which was not contagious, was
uncovered following routine investigations undertaken by zoo veterinarians
after the death of the cat.
"Asiatic Golden Cats are an endangered species and zoo breeding programs are
vital for their survival," said Dr Millar. "This animal was born in a zoo in
Germany in 1992 and imported to Melbourne Zoo from the Netherlands in 1998
under the standard lifetime quarantine conditions. During its captivity the
cat was only ever fed chicken, rat, rabbit and kangaroo meat."
After the cat's death from pancreatitis, routine pathological screening of
tissues collected at autopsy revealed lesions suggestive of TSE.
"Samples sent to the CSIRO's Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong
were considered as positive for this rare condition. Samples will now be
sent to Europe for further confirmation. Methodical investigations are
undertaken into any animal that dies at the zoo. It was gratifying to see
the effectiveness of this approach being born out in this particular case."
Dr Millar said TSEs were a group of diseases that included bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie of sheep and goats, neither of which occur
in Australia. TSEs have previously been reported in a number of zoo species
overseas, including wild cats and antelopes. Dr Millar said Australian
authorities had previously diagnosed a TSE case in a cheetah imported from a
British zoo, but that this was the first report of a TSE in an Asiatic
Golden Cat.
The history of this case, including feeding practices at Melbourne zoo,
indicates that the Asiatic Golden Cat acquired TSE before being imported.
This diagnosis will, therefore, not affect Australia's TSE-free status for
animals. There are no implications for public health or the livestock
industries from this finding. This finding serves to illustrate the highly
effective surveillance system in place in Australia to monitor for
significant, new, or emerging animal disease conditions.
