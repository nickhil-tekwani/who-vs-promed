Fifteen TBE cases diagnosed
---------------------------
Since the beginning of this year 6109 persons,
including 1059 children have sustained tick-bites
in Saint-Petersburg and the Leningrad region. As
a result 15 persons fell ill with tick-borne
encephalitis (compared with 11 during the same period last year).
In first half of last year 7796 persons,
including 1429 children sustained tick bites.
Within the city boundary the number of tick-bite
victims has decreased also -- 615 persons this
year compared with 788 last year. According to
the Saint Petersburg City Diagnostic Virology
Centre 3.5 percent of ticks recovered from
patients were carriers of tick-borne encephalitis
virus. 4352 people sought medical treatment for
tick-bite at the Botkin City Infectious Disease
Hospital and received emergency preventative
treatment. 1053 children were treated in the City
Children's Infectious Disease Hospital, and 989
persons received anti-tick immunoglobulin.
None of the tick-borne encephalitis patients were
children, and there have been no fatalities.
However, cases of tick-bite associated disease
are not recorded for the Leningrad region.

[Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most
important human arboviral infection of the
central nervous system in Europe and Russia. The
disease is endemic to areas where transmission
vectors (_Ixodes ricinus_, _Ix. persulcatus_) are
distributed. In recent years the incidence of the
disease has increased in Russia and some other
European countries., possibly as a result of
expansion of the tick population due to climatic
change and changes in agricultural practice.
Recent analyses of the the complete coding
sequences of all recognized tick-borne flavivirus
species, (including Gadgets Gully, Royal Farm and
Karshi virus, seabird-associated flaviviruses,
Kadam virus and previously uncharacterized
isolates of Kyasanur Forest disease virus and
Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus) have resulted in
revision of the taxonomy of the tick-borne
flaviviruses. Three major groups (mammalian,
seabird and Kadam tick-borne flavivirus groups)
have been identified and the Tick-borne
encephalitis viruses and Louping ill virus have
been assigned to a unique species (designated
Tick-borne encephalitis virus). This virus
species comprises four distinct viral types (i.e.
Western tick-borne encephalitis virus, Eastern
tick-borne encephalitis virus, Turkish sheep
tick-borne encephalitis virus and Louping ill
tick-borne encephalitis virus). See: Grard, G. et
al.Genetic characterization of tick-borne
flaviviruses: new insights into evolution,
pathogenetic determinants and taxonomy. Virology. 2007 Apr 25;361(1):80-92.
The virus present throughout Russia is likely to
be Eastern tick-borne encephalitis virus.- Mod.CP]
