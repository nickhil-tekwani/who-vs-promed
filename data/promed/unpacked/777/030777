Footrot a high risk for sheep producers
---------------------------------------
Central Tablelands Local Land Services has warned sheep producers to insist on an Animal Health Statement when purchasing or agisting sheep or goats, following reported cases of footrot in central western NSW [New South Wales].

The unusually wet conditions currently being experienced in many areas increases the risk of expression and spread of the disease.

"Reports have emerged in areas that have not seen this notifiable disease in decades, so sheep producers need to be alert," said Dr Amy Masters, Central Tablelands Local Land Services District Veterinarian.

"Soil temperatures are starting to warm up and frequent rain is creating lush pastures that retain a high moisture content, creating ideal conditions for footrot to spread."

Dr Masters says up to a dozen suspected traces of footrot are currently being investigated on the Central Tablelands.

"Although the results are still to be confirmed, given the recent reports of footrot in the Central West, it's probably only a matter of time before we see a higher prevalence of footrot showing up on the Central Tablelands."

All producers are encouraged to be vigilant, and are advised to only bring stock onto their properties from reputable sources. Stock health statements should be requested and carefully examined before stock movements occur to avoid the introduction of disease.

Footrot is debilitating for stock and it is expensive and labour intensive to eradicate. Producers are advised to isolate newly introduced sheep, and to ensure they are healthy with no signs of lameness, before allowing contact with other animals on the property.

Properties that are diagnosed with footrot are quarantined and a plan is implemented to eradicate the disease. Treatment options including destocking or treating the mob with foot baths, foot paring and regular inspection until the disease is eradicated.

Signs of footrot include lame sheep, inflammation between the digits and underrunning of the sole and heel. In severe cases sheep will lie down, walk on their knees and lose weight.

"Determining the cause of lameness can be difficult without a thorough veterinary examination, so it is prudent to contact your local vet for advice if clinical signs occur," said Dr Masters.

"If you have any concerns about lameness, it's wise to investigate before footrot has a chance to spread to the rest of your flock."

Virulent footrot is notifiable under the Stock Diseases Act 1923. Any landholder, land manager, agent or vet who suspects that footrot is present in a mob is legally obliged to notify a District Veterinarian as soon as possible.

Producers should also ensure fences are in good condition to keep stray stock out. If you witness lame sheep or any other signs of footrot, call your nearest Local Land Services District Veterinarian.

[Foot rot is a contagious bacterial disease of sheep and goats, caused by the organism _Dichelobacter nodosus_ in association with a number of other bacteria.

There are many strains of _D. nodosus_ and they vary in the severity of the disease they cause. In an infected flock, several strains of _D. nodosus_ may be present. For regulatory purposes, foot rot infection is classified as either benign or virulent at the flock level.

With full expression, virulent foot rot is a severe, debilitating disease with significant economic loss from reduced wool growth and quality, poor ewe fertility, poor growth rates, losses from blowfly strike, and reduced value of sale sheep. In infected flocks, there are also significant costs associated with the control of the disease.

Because of these animal welfare and economic impacts, virulent foot rot is a notifiable disease in NSW with regulatory support for compulsory eradication programs in infected flocks.

Foot rot eradication strategies in southern NSW are based on a predictable spread period in spring, combined with hot dry summers that provide a reliable non-spread period suited to undertaking eradication inspections.
