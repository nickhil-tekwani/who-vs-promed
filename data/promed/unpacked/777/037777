Driving towards Lihue on Kuhio highway, quarantine signs warn about
transporting banana plants to and from the area. These signs are the
fading echo of a statewide initiative in 2000 to contain what has now
become a rampant epidemic on Oahu, Maui, and Kauai.
The _Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) has spread and if not swiftly
dealt with, may impede bananas from growing on island soil for years
to come. With limited financial resources from Hawaii State
Department of Agriculture (HDOA), the burden to arrest this disease
weighs on anyone who has a banana plant growing on their property.
BBTV 1st appeared on Kauai in 1997, 8 years after it had 1st been
observed on Oahu. A seemingly successful but costly eradication led
by HDOA lasting 15 months and destroying 25 000 plants led residents
to believe the problem would not continue. Unfortunately, informed
Kauai farmers and Craig Kaneshige, the pest specialist at Kauai's
DOA, report the disease has come back and taken a strong hold. "My
partner and I have recently seen diseased plants from Kalihiwai ridge
to Hanapepe. Not only right off the road, but also deep inland. My
partner went hiking into the valley, and spotted wild banana plants
that are infected now."
The prognosis for a disease of this magnitude is devastating not only
for local farmers, but any resident interested in having locally
grown bananas at the markets, rather than imported South American
varieties available at chain grocery stores. Skeptics only need look
at the BBTV epidemic that hit Australia in the 1920s, which nearly
wiped out the entire producing industry, and where it has taken years
of conscientious vigilance to keep BBTV out.
BBTV is spread by a vampire aphid that feeds on a plant and
simultaneously infects it. Throughout its life span of 15-20 days the
aphid will carry the disease as it moves from plant to plant, and
once a plant is infected, a clean aphid can contract the disease just
by feeding on a sick plant. "Banana plants that show symptoms rarely
bear fruit," states a CTAHR [College of Tropical Agriculture and
Human Resources] document.
One of the main problems affecting the high speed of infection is
that the aphid also likes island flowers, such as heliconia. "I was
so upset to see the disease had gotten down to Hanapepe," said
Kaneshige, "my theory is that people visiting the Kauai Veteran's
Cemetery had taken fresh-cut flowers to the graves with aphids living
on the flower. Then they jumped the road, and now those plants, near
the cemetery all have BBTV."
"Public education is the only way any level of control can be
obtained," said Scot Nelson. "I am a plant pathologist working as a
liaison between the banana industry and CTAHR at UH [University of
Hawaii]. We've been able to create educational materials and
opportunities with grant monies to address the problem, but it is so
hard to control and not many home owners are aware they have
contributed to the problem by not recognizing that the disease is in
their backyard."
Local Kauai farmer and sustainable agricultural spokesperson, Ray
Maki, feels frustrated with the lack of state funds dedicated to this
issue, "the individual household doesn't have the resources or
knowledge to deal with this. It would probably take at least one
million [US] dollars to deal with it, and all you have to do is look
at the commercial value to realize it's really not high on the
priority list. Follow the money." Importing bananas is cheaper than
growing them in Hawaii.
Yet, Nelson and Kaneshige encourage individuals to become educated,
recognize the disease, and inject the infected plants with
insecticide and have their corms destroyed. "We are here to give all
the materials and information you need to get rid of it," said
Nelson, pointing to his website. "We can give recommendations, come
out to your farm, help you. But honestly, no one calls. I get maybe 2
calls a month on this problem," said Kaneshige.
Maki wants to see more effort from the state, "that'' the real
mechanism. We need a study done, a mapping of the disease, then a
strict regional quarantine. The disease is now systemic, but if you
can control the vector and stop the spreading then we can improve on
it. I wonder if we'll get a handle on it."
Public apathy was best illustrated when Nelson recently held a free
meeting on Hilo for anyone interested in how to protect their plants,
"3 people showed up. It's really time people take responsibility," he
said. Maki agrees that many of the farmer's plants have been affected
by "residential plants, where the people didn't know how to recognize
the disease," and that education is the 1st step.
"Planting the somewhat more resilient dwarf Brazilian' (apple banana)
variety helps, conducting regular scouting of your plants checking
for symptoms that can remain latent in the plant, treating the aphids
and then destroying the plants that have been infected," are a few
things Nelson suggested.
Kaneshige also explained that before injecting producing plants with
herbicides, "you can dry-out the aphids by pouring soapy water on
them and harvest the remaining bananas."

[BBTV is the only member of the genus _Babuvirus_, family
_Nanoviridae_. It only affects _Musa_ spp. causing chlorosis,
stunting, and death of the host plant. The name abaca bunchy top
disease is used for BBTV affecting _Musa textilis_ (abaca, Manila
hemp) in the Philippines. BBTV was 1st noted in Fiji in 1889 and
spreads in Africa, Australasia, and the Pacific Islands.
The virus is transmitted by the aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_
(banana aphid) in a persistent manner. This means that once an insect
has acquired the virus it will remain infectious for life, even after
periods of feeding on alternative plant species, which are not hosts
to the virus. This is the scenario suggested in the story on how BBTV
may have been spread to a new area by infectious aphids travelling on
heliconia flowers. The virus is probably retained when the vector
moults and is not transmitted congenitally to the progeny of the
insect. The vector is even more widespread than the virus. BBTV
cannot be transmitted by mechanical inoculation.
Disease management includes vector control, removal of inoculum, the
use of clean planting material, and frequent scouting for new
outbreaks. Planting somewhat tolerant varieties as mentioned in the
story will enable some crop production in infected areas, but these
cultivars may still serve as virus reservoirs. The Australian
situation referred to above is a long period of disease suppression
since the 1970s. Occasional new outbreaks that have occurred are met
with immediate and strict phytosanitary measures in cooperation with
growers and the public -- according to this story, such a response
system is not available in Hawaii and therefore BBTV appears out of
control there.
