A total of 444 construction workers laid up with salmonellosis remain in
hospitals in the Moscow region, the press and information department of the
Ministry for Emergency Situations told Tass.
A total of 444 workers employed at Sheremetyevo-3 terminal in Moscow, the
IKEA-Khimki Business Park construction sites, had been hospitalized since
20 Jun 2007, a representative of the Ministry for Emergency Situations said.
Managers of the ENKA Company have been questioned within the framework of
an investigation into mass food poisoning of construction workers employed
at Terminal 3 at Sheremetyevo airport.
Almost all of the workers arrived in Russia from Turkey, Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan to work on construction sites in Moscow. They
lived on the premises of Ozero Krugloye recreation center in the
Solnechnogorsk district.

[Neither the specific serotype of the salmonella involved here nor the
vehicle for transmission is stated in the posting.
Solnechnogorsk is a town and district in the Moscow Oblast in Russia. The
name is derived from a village named Solnechnaya Gora (literally Sunny
Hill), which existed where the town is now. The oblast can be found on a
map at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Oblast>.
For those readers interested in the meaning of the word oblast: Oblast
refers to a type of administrative division in Slavic countries and in some
countries of the former Soviet Union. The word is considered to be a
loanword in English, but it is often translated as "area", "zone",
"province", or "region". The latter translation may actually lead to the
confusion, because the subdivision of oblast is called 'raion'. The latter
word is translated as "region" or "district", depending on the context
(from <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast>). - Mod.LL]
