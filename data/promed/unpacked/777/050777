Swine fever breaks out
----------------------
Over 100 pigs have died of African swine fever. The veterinary
officer, Dr Nelson Yesho, said 5000 pigs could die if the disease,
that struck Sipi and Kamoko sub-counties, is not contained. "The
disease came through the neighbouring district of Sironko. There has
been a quarantine put in place to check the pig movement," Yesho
said. He called upon the residents to abide by animal health
regulations to help contain the disease.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a serious viral disease of pigs,
endemic in Africa. The African swine fever virus (ASFV) is highly
contagious, and can spread very rapidly in pig populations by direct
or indirect contact. This virus can persist for long periods in pig
products and the environment. It can also become endemic in feral or
wild Suidae, and in _Ornithodoros_ ticks. ASFV isolates vary in
virulence from highly pathogenic strains that cause near 100 percent
mortality to low-virulence isolates that can be difficult to
diagnose. There is no vaccine or treatment.

ASF is endemic in most of sub-Saharan Africa, including the island of
Madagascar; the highest incidence of disease is seen from the equator
to the northern Transvaal. Disease outbreaks have also occurred in
Europe, South America, and the Caribbean; the cost of eradication has
been significant. During outbreaks in Malta and the Dominican
Republic, the swine herds of these countries were completely
depopulated. In Spain and Portugal, ASFV became endemic in the 1960s
and complete eradication took more than 30 years. Changes in
production practices and increased globalization have increased the
risk of ASF being introduced into North America. In 2007, it was
introduced into Georgia (most probably by infected pig-meat offal
unloaded from a ship, recycled and fed to local pigs) and has since
been continuing its spread throughout the Caucasus and into south
Russia.

Formerly classified as a member of the family Iridoviridae, the ASF
virus (ASFV) is currently the sole member of the new genus
_Asfivirus_ in the family _Asfarviridae_. ASFV is the only DNA virus
transmitted by arthropods. Distinct antigenic types have not been
identified for this virus, but restriction enzyme analysis has been
used to identify viral genotypes. ASFV isolates can vary greatly in
their virulence, from highly virulent isolates that kill most pigs to
viruses that result only in seroconversion.

Acute disease is characterized by high fever, hemorrhages in the
reticuloendothelial system, and a high mortality rate. Infectious
virus can survive for several months in fresh and salted dried-meat
products. The disease is not zoonotic.

Uganda's most recent report on ASF dates back to October 2007, when
several outbreaks were reported from the 3 districts Mukono,
Nakasongola, and Wakiso. Previously, the disease was officially
described as "present in the whole country but without quantitative
data."

The Kapchorwa district is situated in Uganda's Eastern Region,
adjacent to Kenya. Previous outbreaks in the Eastern Region were
reported in ProMED-mail posting 20060109.0076.
