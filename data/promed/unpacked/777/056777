[Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been detected in cattle in the district of Bint Jbeil, An Nabatiyah (Nabatieh) Province, Lebanon.]

The National News Agency reported that after monitoring cases of FMD [local vernacular name, Hafour] in the villages of the district, the Agricultural Services Center in the Municipalities Union of Bint Jbeil District, in cooperation with the Jihad Al-Bina Development Foundation, and in coordination with the Cattle Breeders Syndicate in the south, started a vaccination campaign against this disease for cows in the villages of the union.

To prevent the spread of disease among cows and in the interest of livestock, livestock keepers should adhere to the following guidelines: maintain cleanliness and periodic sterilization of farms, isolate the affected animal, and make sure before buying cows that they are free of contagious diseases.

[This report of an FMD outbreak in Lebanon is still unofficial and occurs simultaneously with outbreaks in Israel and northern Syria. It would be interesting to investigate the serotype responsible for the outbreak and compare it with those responsible for the current outbreaks in Syria and Israel. - Mod.SMA

Assumed, the FMD virus circulation in the Bint Jbeil district and, most probable, other parts of Lebanon preceded the epizootic affecting Israel's livestock (cattle and goats). The epizootic in Israel, which started 1 Jan 2021 (20210107.8079606), is restricted to the Lebanese border area and to young unvaccinated animals or those which had not been vaccinated during the past 12 months. As of 14 Feb 2021, 11 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE. The virus strain was serotyped O, genotyped ME-SA/PanAsia-2. Bint Jbail is located 3.5 km (about 2.2 mi) from the Lebanese-Israeli border (map at https://tinyurl.com/55bkjk7p).

In ProMED's previous FMD reports from Israel and Syria, references were made to OIE's WAHIS (World Animal Health Information System) interface, including previous reports and the global FMD map. WAHIS has, according to received notification, "ceased to exist for all users on 19 Feb 2021," to undergo transition to OIE-WAHIS. "The transition period will last approximately 2 weeks," when the OIE-WAHIS "goes live again." - Mod.AS
