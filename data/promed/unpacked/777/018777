Five Connecticut lobstermen's groups are taking part in independent testing
that an environmental group believes will show pollution played a role in
the deaths of millions of lobsters in Long Island Sound.
Beginning next week, the groups will collect dead lobsters and sediment in
the western Sound waters, between Norwalk and Glen Cove, New York (NY). The
samples will be sent to a laboratory in Fairfax, Virginia., where they will
be tested.
The testing, expected to cost from $75 000 to $100 000, will be funded by
FISH Unlimited Inc., a Shelter Island, NY-based fisheries conservation
group with 14 000 members nationwide.
"In Western Long Island Sound, there are no more lobsters ... these guys
are completely wiped out," said Bill Smith, executive director of FISH
Unlimited. Many lobstermen in the Sound reported death rates of 50 percent
or more last fall.
Michael Horvath, president of the Western Connecticut Lobstermen's
Association, said he is planning to sell his business because of the
financial losses he has suffered from the lobster dieoff. "This is taking
out the fishermen," he said. "There is no stock out there. It is completely
devastated, and now we're in debt and we've got nowhere to go."
In November, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection said
preliminary tests indicated that a tiny parasite known as paramoeba may be
to blame for the lobster deaths.
But Smith said his group believes the dieoff may have been caused by
contaminated dredge dumped into Western Long Island Sound last fall from
Mamaroneck Harbor, NY The material contained pesticides and other heavy
metals, Smith said.
He said at the same time the material was being dumped in the Sound,
officials in New York and Connecticut were spraying pesticides to prevent
the spread of the West Nile encephalitis outbreak. He said his group
believes heavy rains from Hurricane Floyd in September may have washed the
pesticides into the Sound.
Lawmakers from New York and Connecticut have lobbied for money to help the
lobstermen.
Last month, President Clinton asked Congress for $10 million in aid and for
research to determine what is killing the lobsters. The Clinton
administration named the Sound a Commercial Fishery Disaster area in January.
The Long Island Sound is the No. 3 lobster market behind Maine and
Massachusetts. Connecticut brings in about 3.5 million pounds a year, while
NY brings in about 8.5 million pounds
Smith said his group expects to have the test results back by mid-May.
The 5 groups participating in the sample collection and testing are: The
Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association, the Western Long Island Sound
Lobstermen's Association, The Connecticut Lobstermen's Association, The
Western Connecticut Lobstermen's Association and the Westchester
Lobstermen's and Dealers Association.
