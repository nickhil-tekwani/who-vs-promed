The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) and the Tennessee Department of Agriculture (TDA) want to make Tennesseans aware of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus type 2 (RHDV2). In late January [2022], RHDV2 was detected in 2 domestic rabbits in East Tennessee.

RHDV2 has not been found in Tennessee's wild rabbit populations, but the virus is of major concern, as it is highly contagious and lethal to wild and domestic rabbits. In Tennessee, eastern cottontails, Appalachian cottontails, and swamp rabbits are susceptible to RHDV2. Currently, RHDV2 only infects rabbit species and has not been documented to affect humans or any other animal species.

The virus can be transmitted through direct contact with infected rabbits or carcasses, meat or their fur, feces, body fluids, contaminated bedding materials, or other materials having been contaminated. People can inadvertently spread the virus into new areas by moving infected live rabbits, carcasses or parts from infected animals, as well as on clothing and shoes. The virus can persist in the environment for an extended time, which makes it difficult to control the disease once it affects wild rabbit populations.

People are asked to report rabbits appearing to be bleeding or sightings of multiple dead rabbits to a TWRA regional office. Visit here for office information. Do not handle dead rabbits. Rabbits carry other diseases capable of sickening people.

The United States Department of Agriculature website has the most current map of outbreaks of RHDV2 at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/maps/animal-health/rhd. If persons travel to states currently experiencing die-offs and take part in outdoor activities, make sure to clean clothing and disinfect shoes before returning to Tennessee.

The following preventative measures are recommended for hunters and rabbit owners to limit exposure and spread of RHDV2:

Hunters and falconers:
- avoid killing rabbits appearing to be sick;
- when processing rabbit, wear disposable gloves;
- disinfect equipment and wash hands;
- prepare meat to an internal temperature of at least 165Â°F (74 deg C);
- bury rabbit remains to discourage scavenging.

Rabbit owners:
- keep rabbits indoors or keep rabbit enclosures raised and off the ground;
- wash hands, clothes, and shoes before and after contact with domestic rabbits;
- do not handle dead or wild rabbits;
- quarantine new domestic rabbits for at least 30 days from other animals;
- notify the state veterinarian's office if you experience sudden deaths or high mortality in your rabbitry at <animal.health@tn.gov>.

A vaccine for RHDV2 to be used in domestic rabbits is now available in over 40 states, including Tennessee. The vaccine was produced by Medgene Labs and was granted Emergency Use Authorization by the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics in October of 2021. The vaccine has been effective in preventing severe and fatal disease from RHDV2 infection in domestic rabbits but is meant as a supplement to the above preventative measures. Please contact your local veterinarian. Veterinarians in Tennessee may contact Medgene labs, which will then distribute vaccines to licensed veterinarians with approval from the state veterinarian.

[In the 1980s, European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The first outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _O. cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled to wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits, and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes. Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged, and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (<2 months old) and RHD-vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia. - Mod.PMB/TG
