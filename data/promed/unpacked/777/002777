Death stalks the dingy corridors of Baba Raghav Das (BRD) Medical College
in Gorakhpur. Fear and anxiety are palpable, particularly in the medicine
and paediatrics wards on Friday afternoon [7 Nov 2008]. Loud wails rent the
air as ward boys cart away yet another victim of a mystery disease.

The death toll in the medical college alone since this May 2008 has risen
to 421, and there's no sign of letup. But, away from the chaos that has in
its grip the entire endemic pocket of Purvanchal, experts carry on academic
debates to fix the identity of the killer virus, which has in some form or
other claimed more than 3000 lives in the past 5 years.

Interestingly, there is a marked sense of relief among the group that
Type-B Arbo, which causes Japanese encephalitis (JE) cannot be blamed
solely. It could be another mutant [virus], offers Dr K P Kushwaha, head
and professor of paediatrics at the BRD medical college.

There is, in any case, a wide variety to pick from: enterovirus, eco virus
[echovirus? - Mod.SH], Coxsackie-B mutant, Saharanpur encephalitis, and the
killer weed that took 600 lives in 2006, or the convenient [uncommitted]
acute encephalitis syndrome.

[This report adds to the uncertainty of which etiological agent is involved
in these cases. Since late July 2008, the number of fatal encephalitis
cases in this hospital has risen from 88 to 421, apparently without a
laboratory-confirmed diagnosis for most of them (ProMED-mail archive no.
20080731.2345). The elimination of Japanese encephalitis "Type-B Arbo" (JEV
flavivirus) as the etiological agent of all of the cases implies that JEV
infection may be responsible for some of the deaths, although this report
does not indicate how many. Previous reports indicate that 5 per cent of
earlier cases have been shown to be caused by JEV. It is not clear whether
laboratory tests have been carried out to identify which of the suspected
viruses mentioned in the report have been involved or ruled out in these cases.

Dr Deborah Phillips of PATH, USA <dphillips@path.org> in her comments in
ProMED-mail archive no. 20081017.3295 indicated that the outbreak was not
thought by the government medical officers to be JE, but due to the
similarity of symptoms between JEV and other acute encephalitis virus
infections, clinical diagnosis is not reliable, and therefore laboratory
confirmation is needed. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving further
information about case numbers and laboratory test results as they become
available.
