The total number of people connected to Fairleigh Dickinson
University suffering from a stomach virus rose to 194 on Mon 5 Mar
2007. The virus outbreak affected students, faculty, and those in
administration. A letter sent to the parents of students states that
the Florham Park Board of Health determined the cause of the illness
to be a norovirus infection and not food poisoning, as many students
originally believed.
"The virus can spread in a number of ways ...... through
person-to-person contact, contact with infected surfaces such as door
knobs, bathroom surfaces or table tops, and contaminated food,"
Provost Kenneth Greene wrote in a letter to parents, sent on Mon 5
Mar 2007. "The most important preventive measure is frequent
hand-washing."
The number of people who contracted the virus had steadily gone up
since Saturday [3 Mar 2007], when it was reported that 89 people
became sick. As of Monday [5 Mar 2007] morning, 124 people had
reported getting sick but 10 new cases were reported later in the day
and an additional 60 people reported to university health services
they were sick but were now fine. That brought the total up to 194.
A total of 20 students suffering from such ailments as diarrhea,
dehydration, and nausea were sick enough that they required treatment
at Morristown Memorial Hospital. Approximately 2000 students attend
the university, 1500 of whom live on the Florham Park campus.
