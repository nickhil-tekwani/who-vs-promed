_Salmonella_ outbreak linked to small turtles
---------------------------------------------
CDC and public health officials in several states are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections linked to small turtles. Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback evidence show that contact with small turtles is making people sick.

Epidemiologic data
------------------
As of 20 Feb 2021, a total of 22 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Typhimurium have been reported from 7 states. Illnesses started on dates ranging from [27 Aug 2020], to [16 Jan 2021].

Location / number of sick people
---------------------------------
California / 5
Connecticut / 2
Florida / 1
Maryland / 1
New Jersey / 2
North Carolina / 2
Pennsylvania / 9
----------------
Total / 22

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for _Salmonella_. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

Sick people range in age from less than 1 to 59 years, with a median age of 6. As many as 31% are female. Of 19 people with information available, 8 were hospitalized and 1 death has been reported from Pennsylvania.

State and local public health officials interviewed people about the animals they came into contact with in the week before they got sick. Of the 18 people who provided this information, 15 (83%) reported contact with pet turtles. Of the 9 people who reported the size of their pet turtle, 9 (100%) reported contact with pet turtles with shells less than 4 inches in length. People reported getting their turtles from various places, including flea markets, roadside vendors, and a pet store.

Laboratory and traceback data
-----------------------------
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS).

WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak likely got sick from the same source.

On [29 Jan 2021], the Pennsylvania Department of Health collected samples from a turtle habitat in a sick person's home for testing. WGS showed that the _Salmonella_ in the turtle's environment is closely related to bacteria from sick people. This means that people likely got sick from touching small turtles or something in their habitat.

WGS of bacteria isolated from 9 people's samples and 2 environmental samples from a turtle habitat did not predict any antibiotic resistance. CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory also conducted standard antibiotic susceptibility testing on bacteria isolated from three outbreak samples and found no resistance.

A common supplier of small turtles has not yet been identified. It is often difficult to determine a common farm or supplier of small turtles due to the illegal practice of sales of small turtles by mobile vendors who do not stay in a single location.

Public health actions
---------------------
CDC advises that you always take steps to stay healthy around your pet turtle: wash your hands, play safely, and keep supplies and the pet area clean.

Do not buy small turtles with shells less than 4 inches long. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration bans the sale and distribution of these turtles.

[A number of serotypes of _S. enterica_ have been linked to human infections. In 2008, the CDC reported on an ongoing outbreak of _S._ Paratyphi B var. Java (CDC. _Salmonella_ infections associated with exposure to turtles -- USA, 2007-2008. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2008; 57(03):69-72; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5703a3.htm). Some of the discussion of the report is reproduced below:

"The prohibition on the sale and distribution of small turtles was enacted in 1975, after public health investigations demonstrated that small turtles were a major source of human _Salmonella_ infections, particularly in children. In 1972, a study in New Jersey indicated that small pet turtles accounted for approximately 23% of _Salmonella_ infections in children (4). In 1980, the 1975 prohibition was estimated to have prevented 100 000 _Salmonella_ infections in American children each year since going into effect (5). However, this prohibition has an exception: Small turtles may be sold legally for scientific, educational, or exhibition purposes. During 2001-2006, the number of turtles kept as pets in the USA increased 86% to nearly 2 million turtles (6), suggesting that this exception might provide a mechanism by which small turtles become household pets.

"Turtles, like other reptiles, commonly carry _Salmonella_, and fecal carriage rates can be as high as 90% (1). Small turtles sold as pets frequently come from breeding farms, where turtles are housed in crowded ponds and nesting areas in a way that promotes _Salmonella_ transmission (7). Attempts to treat turtles, turtle eggs, and turtle breeding ponds with antibiotics to eliminate _Salmonella_ have not been successful and have resulted in a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance (7, 8). Other treatments reduce but do not eliminate shedding from turtles (8), and the turtles that continue to shed might re-contaminate other turtles during rearing or shipment. Because shedding might be intermittent and stress related, determining whether turtles are free of the bacteria is difficult (1).

"Direct or indirect contact with a reptile is associated with an estimated 6% of human salmonellosis in the USA (9). Persons coming into contact with reptiles, reptile habitats, or surfaces contaminated with reptile fecal matter risk infection from salmonellae shed by the reptile (10). Although most reptiles carry _Salmonella_, small turtles are likely to be handled differently than other reptiles and thus carry a greater risk of transmitting _Salmonella_ to children. In contrast to the obvious risk for a bite or scratch, for example, from a snake or an iguana, a small turtle is likely to be perceived as safe, and thus might be given directly to small children to play with. In addition, a young child placed in charge of caring for a turtle has direct contact with water in the turtle habitat, where salmonellae are likely to multiply to high numbers. Although approximately half of the infections associated with this outbreak occurred in young children, who are at greater risk for severe illness from salmonellosis (2, 10), several illnesses occurred in adults with turtle exposure, demonstrating that turtle-associated salmonellosis is not unique to children. Additionally, only 20% of case-patients interviewed reported awareness of the link between salmonellosis and contact with reptiles, indicating that measures to educate the public about this link have not been successful. CDC has provided recommendations to prevent reptile-associated salmonellosis in humans (2). However, because of the particular hazard associated with small turtles, prohibiting the sale and distribution of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis."
