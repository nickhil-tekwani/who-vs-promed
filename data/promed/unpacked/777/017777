China's poultry industry leaders have asked health authorities to share less information about an outbreak of bird flu [avian influenza], as sales have suffered from an ever increasing death toll. In open letters, the national association of poultry farmers and their provincial counterparts in Guangxi and Guangdong have asked local authorities to "stop reporting individual cases of H7N9", referring to the deadly bird flu strain, according to a report in the state-run Xinhua news agency [in Chinese, 4 Feb 2014 http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2014-02-04/215529397935.shtml]. Authorities should "avoid excessively detailed reports" on infections to prevent further damage to the industry, the report said.

Another statement on the website of the National Animal Husbandry Association [in Chinese, 4 Feb 2014 http://www.caaa.cn/show/newsarticle.php?ID=329866] claimed that identifying the virus as a bird flu strain has brought "disaster" to the industry, leading to losses of more than 100 billion yuan (HK dollars 127 billion [about USD 16.36 billion]). The letter, signed by 1012 poultry industry executives, said some industry players were facing heavy losses and even bankruptcy due to the disease's stigma and misinformation by the media over its spread via the birds. Losses so far this year [2014] have already amounted to 20 billion yuan [about USD 3.3 billion], it said. Guangdong authorities have stopped sharing unsolicited reports on infections with the press over the last days, Xinhua said on Wednesday [5 Feb 2014].

However, a name change for H7N9 -- which industry associations want to be called simply as "flu" -- has yet to occur. The World Health Organisation [WHO] and the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention continue to refer to the disease as avian flu. "The source of infection is assumed to be direct or indirect contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments," WHO warns in a disease briefing on its website. "There is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission," it said.

The spread of the virus has gained rapid pace this year [2014]. By Tuesday [4 Feb 2014], 115 human infections, including 25 deaths, have been confirmed, whereas [during] the entire last year [2013] only 144 [human infections were] reported, of which 46 were fatal, according to official figures.

In Hong Kong, reports have led to the culling of at least 20 000 chickens last week [week of 27 Jan 2014], less than a month after the SAR's Department of Health banned the sale of live chickens. Mainland provinces have followed suit. Egg prices have plummeted 6.4 per cent in the mainland on average by mid-January [2014] compared to a year earlier, according to the China Livestock Information Network. Chicken meat prices have fallen 3.3 per cent. In 2012, the poultry industry employed 70 million people and accounted for one-fourth of China's agricultural sector, generating some 689 billion yuan [about USD 113.7 billion], the industry association said.

Cases of the new H7N9 avian influenza in China are surging alarmingly, flu experts warned this week. There are now about 300 confirmed cases, with more appearing every day. Roughly a quarter of the victims have died.

The 1st human cases were reported only last March [2013]. By contrast, the H5N1 influenza virus, another lethal strain that jumped from birds to people, first appeared in 2003 and took almost 5 years to reach the 300-case mark. "H7N9 is blowing right by H5N1," said Michael T Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. "I'm really worried about that."

At the same time, an even newer avian flu in China has killed its 1st human victim. That strain, known as H10N8, has been confirmed in only 2 people -- a 73 year old woman who died in December [2013] but whose infection was confirmed later, and a 55 year old woman from the same province hospitalized in January [2014]. Both had contact with live poultry.

(Influenzas are described by the shapes of 2 protuberances on their surfaces: the hemagglutinin "spike," or "H," that attaches to cells, and the neuraminidase "helicopter," or "N," that chops off receptors, allowing new viruses to escape. There are 18 known types of H and 11 of N.)

While the newer influenza virus is worrisome, a mere 2 cases is "a far, far cry" from the risk posed by H7N9, said Ruben Donis, chief of preparedness for the flu division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He noted that the H7N9 virus had infected people in 10 Chinese provinces and was close to the borders of Viet Nam, Cambodia, and other poor Southeast Asian nations less adept than China at flu surveillance.

Birds appear to be spreading the H7N9 virus more through their breath than through feces, the normal infection route, Dr Osterholm said, which means that fecal-sample testing in live markets may miss cases.

Monitoring the spread of the H7N9 and H10N8 viruses is difficult because neither makes chickens sick. Poultry farmers resist testing because a positive test forces them to destroy flocks that appear healthy. By contrast, the H5N1 virus rapidly kills flocks, so farmers want it extinguished.

[An OIE summary of the event since its reported start in early 2013, including links to the initial, immediate report (submitted 4 Apr 2014) and to all 11 follow-up reports, as well as an interactive map showing the 25 sites found infected until 26 Jan 2014, is available at http://tinyurl.com/kdu3zxo.

According to the said reports, a total of 76 "cases" (positive samples from animals and from the "environment") have been detected within a total of 24 388 "susceptible" birds, leading to the destruction of 114 252 birds in total. Most "outbreaks" were restricted to open bird markets; only one was related to animal death (a domestic pigeon, probably a racing pigeon). The infection could not be traced to farms (see China's Ministry of Agriculture announcement to this effect at http://english.agri.gov.cn/news/dqnf/201401/t20140128_21134.htm); hence, no culling on farms has been applied. The allegedly serious economic losses have been caused by the closure of markets, restrictions upon the movement, trade, and peripheral slaughter of live poultry, decreased consumption and probably decreased exports and other causes -- for which more information will be appreciated. The pigeon racing industry has, most probably, suffered considerable losses due to restrictions as described in ProMED-mail archive no 20130414.1645731. In this respect, we are indebted to Lyle Fearnley, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore who has recently kindly advised us that "halting the flying of domestic pigeons" (in Zhejiang), as described in posting ProMED-mail archive no 20140127.2235860, in effect meant that "keepers of homing pigeons were prevented from letting their birds out of cage to fly, a common practice in many Chinese cities, which has been banned during earlier outbreaks of avian flu." Races of homing pigeons are popular in China.

The new phenomenon, namely low pathogenic avian influenza viruses causing serious disease in humans, is of grave concern, globally. Studies into the veterinary aspects of the issue by national and international bodies are expected to pay special attention to diagnosis (including serology; see Dr Halverson's view in ProMED-mail archive no 20140201.2248029) and prevention (such as vaccination, which is among the issues covered in OIE's H7N9 Q&A at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-influenza-ah7n9/).

Since culling has not been applied on commercial and backyard farms, no compensations were due there. Other means of support to affected farmers, and other stakeholders, particularly to cover losses caused by the official control measures, deserve to be considered. This may secure farmers' cooperation in the complex subject and help in avoiding demands or practice of 'hush out'.

Past experience in China has demonstrated the contribution of transparency in animal disease reporting, not only directly to public health in cases of zoonoses, but also -- in the long run -- to the economy. Subscribers may refer to the histories of BSE, _Salmonella_ serotype Enteritidis, etc., illuminating the potential economic damage caused by hiding or neglecting zoonotic disease agents.

On 27 Jan 2014, China's Ministry of Agriculture included Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region among the provinces where, reportedly, LPAI H7N9 has been detected in poultry (http://www.moa.gov.cn/zwllm/zwdt/201401/t20140127_3750290.htm, in Chinese). Details of this event are expected to be included in the due, 12th follow-up report to OIE.
