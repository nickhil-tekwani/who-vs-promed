Mysterious outbreak among buffaloes
-----------------------------------
The chief of Bolongdai village (Nungba), Ningkham Gangmei informed
IFP over the telephone today [31 Dec 2008] that a mysterious outbreak
of a disease has led to the death of over 12 head of buffalo. According
to him, about 5 buffalo were reported dead in the village prior to
Christmas [25 Dec 2008] while another 7 have died up to yesterday [30
Dec 2008].

He said that he had no reports of death of other types of cattle
[livestock] coming from the village and expressed concern that the
outbreak could also affect other villages since cattle graze together.

"We would like to appeal to the department concerned to send a team as
soon as possible to ascertain the cause of deaths so that the rest of
the cattle can be saved," he said.

He added that the carcasses of some of the animals were still lying
around and could lead to spreading infection. According to him, there
are over 100 buffalo in the village, which is inhabited by about 120
families.

[Nungba is situated within Manipur (northeastern India, bordering
Myanmar); see at
<http://www.maplandia.com/india/manipur/tamenglong/nungba/>.
The state of Manipur can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=1261137&v=24.75,90.433,6>.

Mortality in buffalo can be caused by infectious and non-infectious
(such as, metabolic, toxicological) disease agents, including
helminths and protozoa. Among the infectious disease agents in this
part of the world, FMD (foot-and-mouth disease) and _Pasteurella
multocida_ (the causative agent of hemorrhagic septicemia) deserve
special attention.

Further information on clinical signs and post-mortem changes, and in
particular results of laboratory investigations, if available, are
requested. - Mod.AS]
