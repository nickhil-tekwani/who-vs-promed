A Portland television station is reporting another Oregon case of _E. coli_ that could be linked to the Lincoln County case that killed a 4-year-old of Otis. After seeing reports on KATU TV, the family of a 3-year-old girl who got sick from _E. coli_ is convinced that the case is connected to that fatal case. Both children were in the same general area just before they got sick.

According to the KATU report, the girl who died swam in a section of the South Santiam River in Linn County. Then this newer reported case had her birthday on 23 Aug 2014 at Waterloo Park about 20 minutes away and a few feet from a section of that river. They used a water fountain to fill up water balloons. The mother said her daughter was sick that very night. She brought her daughter to a clinic in Albany, and she said they thought it was a minor virus and sent her home. But the mother told KATU that her daughter kept getting worse and brought her back to the clinic and demanded that doctors perform a blood test.

Two hours later, they confirmed that the girl had _E. coli_, and she was rushed to Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland, just 2 doors down from the fatal case. She was hospitalized for a full week, but she recovered.

[As in the posting regarding the fatal case, this posting does not specifically state that an enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ was detected here. According to this report, the dates given seem to imply that this case occurred prior to the fatal case instead of afterwards, so it is confusing that the mother knew of the fatal case.

Additionally, the incubation period that would link the water exposure to this illness was less than one day, which is quite unusual for this toxemic infection. The usual incubation period ranges from 2 to 12 days, which can be substantially longer than other _E. coli_ infections and has a mean incubation period of 3.7 days. Finally, it would be unusual to diagnose EHEC using a blood test, especially in 2 hours. The diagnosis is made by identifying the organism in the (usually) bloody diarrhea, best using a PCR for the Shiga toxin.

The cause of this illness is, therefore, unclear.

Water exposures, however, can be significant in EHEC transmission. As extracted from Lutwick LI. Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ infections. In: Confronting emerging zoonoses: the One Health paradigm. Yamada A, Kahn LH, Kaplan B, Monath TP, Woodall J, Conti LA (editors). Tokyo, Japan: Springer, (in press):

EHEC has been transmitted via contaminated water from municipal or rural sources of drinking water as well as from water used for recreational or other purposes. EHEC contaminated drinking water is more likely to occur in small water systems or wells supplying rural townships or camps. In general, contamination occurs when cow manure seeps into shallow, unchlorinated, poorly protected water supplies after large rainstorms. Examples include a 1998 outbreak, from contaminated well water, of EHEC O157:H7 (and some _Campylobacter_) causing z921 cases of diarrhea at a New York State county fair in 1999, a 2000 outbreak involving an estimated 2300 cases of EHEC O157:H7 in Walkerton, Ontario, Canada from the town's water supply, and a large 1992 outbreak of serotype O157:H7 in southern Africa.

Contamination of recreational lakes has been linked with EHEC as well as other enteric pathogens, usually linked to domestic or wild animal fecal contamination or untreated sewage runoff. Swimming pools can also be associated with EHEC, minimized by maintaining adequate chlorine levels. Contamination of the pool water is usually directly from pool users. - Mod.LL
