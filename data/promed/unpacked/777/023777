[CORRECTION: The sentinel chicken positive for St. Louis encephalitis in this
report was in Florida and not in Missouri as incorrectly reported in Archive
20061021.3027. ProMED-mail regrets this error and is thankful to Joe Dudley
for pointing out the error. Mod. DK]

The Collier County Health Department reports a sentinel chicken has tested
positive for St. Louis Encephalitis and advises residents to take
precautions to avoid mosquito bites.

The chicken that tested positive was at the Animal Control site in
Immokalee, 1 of 5 locations where the health department has sentinel
chickens for monitoring of encephalitis.

"Although this is concerning, we have not had any human cases of St. Louis
Encephalitis," Ken Rech, environmental health director, said in a
statement. "We want to remind the community that St. Louis Encephalitis is
completely preventable if people take steps to protect themselves against
mosquitoes."

Steps to avoid mosquitoes include:
-- Avoid being outside at dusk and dawn when mosquitoes are most prevalent.
-- Wear clothing to protect skin
-- Use mosquito repellents
-- Get rid of standing water around your home that can serve as a breeding
site for mosquitoes.

St. Louis Encephalitis is caused by a mosquito bite from an infected
mosquito. Human symptoms include mild to severe fever and headache; neck
stiffness, confusion, stupor, tremors, coma and occasional convulsions and
spastic paralysis.

Physicians should contact the health department if they suspect a patient
has the illness.

[St. Louis encephalitis is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by infected
_Culex_ sp. mosquitoes. Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus are
antigenically related to St. Louis encephalitis virus. Saint Louis
encephalitis has sporadically been found throughout the US.

It can only be transmitted by the infected mosquito. It cannot be
transmitted between people. The incubation time is varies from 5 to 15 days.

Generally, this is a mild disease and may initially be mistaken for the
flu, as the first symptoms are fever and headache. In more severe cases the
patient may experience high fever, headache, a sore and stiff neck, some
disorientation and perhaps even stupor. These may be followed by
convulsions, coma, tremors and occasionally a spastic but flaccid paralysis.

Supportive and symptomatic care is recommended, as there is no specific
treatment for this disease. It has been known to have a case fatality rate
of approximately 3 percent.

Prevention is the best treatment. This article outlines the necessary
preventative measures. - Mod.TG]
