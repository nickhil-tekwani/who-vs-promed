==================================================

From: "C.K. Scarborough " <bucks1@ix.netcom.com>

CDC Guidelines Isolation/Hospitals
Is anyone using the latest Guidelines for Isolation Precautions in
Hospitals? (published Jan.1996 Inf Control and Hosp. Epidemiology,
and Feb.1996 AJIC).
Any thoughts about the guidelines at this point?
