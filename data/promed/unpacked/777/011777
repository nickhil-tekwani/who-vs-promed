Two cats reportedly tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in New York. Both had owners who were COVID-19 positive, and both animals were reportedly exhibiting respiratory signs. Additional samples are [reportedly] being sent to NVSL [National Veterinary Services Laboratories] for confirmation.

[From the above report, it may be assumed the 2 clinically affected cats were kept by 2 different COVID-19 patients. The test applied on the cats was, most likely, PCR; the identity of the performer (an authorized lab) was not given. Until further information from NVSL (National Veterinary Services Laboratories) is obtained, the case is regarded as "suspected."

On 5 Apr 2020, the NVSL labs confirmed SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19 in humans) in one tiger at a zoo in New York. This discovery was published by USDA in a press release at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/sa_by_date/sa-2020/ny-zoo-covid-19 (updated 6 Apr 2020; see also 20200406.7191352).

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the CDC website's section, "COVID-19 and Animals." It includes a Q&A page, which was last reviewed 14 Apr 2020. We hereby present the following 2 questions/answers, due to their relevance to the current suspected cases:

"Q. What animals can get COVID-19?
A. We don't know for sure which animals can be infected with the virus causing COVID-19. CDC is aware of a very small number of pets, including dogs and cats, outside the United States reported to be infected with the virus causing COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19. A tiger at a zoo in New York also has tested positive for the virus.

Recent research shows ferrets, cats, and golden Syrian hamsters can be experimentally infected with the virus and can spread the infection to other animals of the same species in laboratory settings. Pigs, chickens, and ducks did not become infected or spread the infection based on results from these studies. Data from one study suggested dogs are not as likely to become infected with the virus as cats and ferrets. These findings were based off a small number of animals and do not indicate whether animals can spread infection to people.

CDC has not received any reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States. To date, there is no evidence pets can spread the virus to people. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals may be affected by the virus causing COVID-19.

Q. Since tigers can get infected with the virus causing COVID-19, should I worry about my pet cat?
A. The tiger infected with the virus causing COVID-19 is the 1st case of its kind. We are still learning about this virus and how it spreads, but it appears it can spread from humans to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a very small number of pets outside the United States, including cats, reported to be infected with the virus causing COVID-19 after close contact with people with COVID-19.

To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets, including cats, becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States. At this time, there is no evidence that pets, including cats and dogs, can spread COVID-19 to people. The virus causing COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person, typically through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, or talking.

People sick with COVID-19 should isolate themselves from other people and animals, including pets, during their illness until we know more about how this virus affects animals. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wear a cloth face covering and wash your hands before and after you interact with pets."

Any additional information on where the cats were initially tested, whether they're confirmed positive by NVSL, etc. would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.JH
