Summary
-------
Uganda has experienced 4 Ebola outbreaks since the discovery of the virus. Recent epidemiological work has shown pigs are hosts for ebolaviruses. Due to their high reproduction rates, rapid weight gain, potential to provide quick financial returns, and rising demand for pork, pig production in Uganda has undergone massive expansion. The combination of pork sector growth supported by development programmes and Ebola virus risk prompted a foresight exercise using desk, interview, and spatial methods. The study found that the lack of serological evidence for specific reservoir species, the number of human index cases unable to account for their source of infection, domestic pig habitat overlap with potential Ebola virus zoonotic host environments, reported interactions at the human-pig-wildlife interface that could support transmission, fever in pigs as a commonly reported problem by pig farmers, and temporal correlation of outbreaks with peak pork consumption periods, warrants further research into potential zoonotic transmission in Uganda from pigs.

[Since the discovery of the Ebola disease in 1976, 51 surveyed locations reporting infections in animals have been identified in the literature. The animal species involved were gorillas, chimpanzees, fruit bats, and duikers (a forest deer, _Cephalophus_ spp). A large proportion of the great ape cases originated from the DRC/Gabon border, coinciding with the main known distributions of both chimpanzees and gorillas and representing a period of well-documented great ape Ebola outbreaks in and around the Lossi Animal Sanctuary, DRC. All animal isolations of Ebola viruses have come from countries that also have reported index cases of human outbreaks, with the exception of several seropositive bats from a survey in southern Ghana.

The genus _Ebolavirus_ (EBOV) currently consists of 5 species: _Zaire ebolavirus_ (ZEBOV), _Sudan ebolavirus_ (SUDV), _Tai forest ebolavirus_ (TAFV), _Bundibugyo ebolavirus_ (BDBV), and _Reston ebolavirus_ (RESTV). RESTV is considered nonpathogenic to humans but has been found to infect pigs (in the Philippines). Most of the outbreaks so far, including the current major one, have been caused by ZEBOV. Uganda's Ebola history includes 3 events: Uganda 2000-2001 (SUDV), Uganda 2007-2008 (BDBV), Uganda 2012 (SUDV).

While fruit bats are considered a natural reservoir, the involvement of other species in the EBOV transmission cycle is unclear, especially for domesticated animals. Dogs and pigs are so far the only domestic animals identified as species that can be infected with EBOV. In 2009, REBOV was the 1st EBOV reported to infect swine with indicated transmission to humans (asymptomatic); and a survey in Gabon found more than 30 percent seroprevalence for EBOV in dogs during the Ebola outbreak in 2001 and 2002.

While infections in dogs appear to be asymptomatic, pigs experimentally infected with EBOV can develop clinical disease, depending on the virus species and possibly the age of the infected animals. In the experimental settings, pigs can transmit ZEBOV to naive pigs and macaques. This led researchers to raise the possibility that wild or domestic pigs may be a natural (non-reservoir) host for EBOV participating in the EBOV transmission to other species in sub-Saharan Africa; their role during Ebola outbreaks in Africa needs to be clarified. Notably, no animal experiments have been carried out with the 2 EBOV species recorded in Uganda (SUDV, BDBV).

The authors of the current paper suggest the following subjects for future research into the role pigs play in EBOV epidemiology (cited):

"1. The role pigs may play in [_Ebolavirus_] transmission. The present data suggest they may be amplifying hosts, but not reservoir hosts. This suggests the conditions under which pigs become [infected] and the role they play in transmission may have many variables that will have to be elucidated.
2. Pig population dynamics as hosts of [_Ebolavirus_].
3. Risks factors to pig farming, specifically in relationship to bat and primate ecology and habitat.
4. Impact of [_Ebolavirus_] on pig production, human health, and livelihoods and food security.
5. Disease course and outcome of the different species of [_Ebolavirus_] infection in pigs.
6. Communicating any risk of [_Ebolavirus_] infection associated with pig production in ways that minimize adverse impacts on pig value chains, poverty, and livelihood."

In case -- following further required studies -- pigs or dogs become implicated in the transmission of an African species of EBOV to humans, development of veterinary vaccines might need to be considered. - Mod.AS
