Pueblo County plague death becomes 2nd in Colorado this year [2015]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Pueblo County health officials on Wednesday, 5 Aug 2015, announced a plague death, the 2nd such death in Colorado in 2015. The Pueblo City-County Health Department identified the person only as an adult. Authorities did not say which form of the plague was responsible for the death.

The person is the 4th in Colorado to contract the plague in 2015, including a 16-year-old Poudre High School student in Larimer County who was killed by a form of the bacterial infection known as septicemic plague. The other 2 cases were in Boulder County and Denver, according to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment.

Health officials say the public should avoid dead animals -- specifically rodents -- and report any large die-offs to county health departments or the state.

[As outlined by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and quoted in ProMED-mail post 20120601.1153277: "Death from bubonic plague occurs after the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_ escapes from the infected bubo into the bloodstream (septicemic plague) causing the manifestations of the sepsis syndrome. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) with subsequent cutaneous hemorrhage may well have been what was called the 'Black Death' in the Middle Ages. The bacterium can spread to the lungs, causing a secondary plague pneumonia (secondary to the bacteremia), or to the meninges, causing a plague meningitis. Both of these events have a high case fatality rate and the secondary plague pneumonia is the way the infection spreads (by aerosol) from person to person.

"The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a 'bubo.' Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14 per cent (1 in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." - Mod.LL
