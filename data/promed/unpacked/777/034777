Another patient suffering from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] has been identified in Dubai [United Arab Emirates]. An elderly Emirati man was taken to hospital after displaying "symptoms of the SARS-like virus", Dubai Health Authority confirmed on Friday [20 Dec 2013], the state news agency WAM reported. The 68 year old patient, who is in the intensive care unit, suffers from diabetes and chronic kidney failure. The health authority is working with the Ministry of Health and other authorities and has "taken necessary precautionary measures consistent with international recommendations and standards set out by the World Health Organization (WHO), including epidemiological investigations for those in touch with the patient", WAM reported.

Last month [November 2013], a Jordanian man, his wife and their 8 year old son were also confirmed as having the virus. The family, who lives in Abu Dhabi, were taken to hospital for treatment. The 32 year old mother, who was 8 months pregnant, died shortly after giving birth via caesarean section. The Health Authority Abu Dhabi said her 38 year old husband and son were stable. The newborn, close family members, and health care workers were being monitored.

WHO's emergency committee held a meeting on 4 Dec 2013 during which the committee called for countries to strengthen their surveillance. The next meeting is due in March [2014]. "WHO also stressed that the virus is not a concern for public health at the moment and that the current situation does not require a travel ban to any country in the world, screenings at different ports, or any restrictions on trade," WAM said.

According to a 17 Dec 2013 bulletin from WHO, from September last year [2012] to date, "the organisation has been informed of a total of 165 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 71 deaths."
