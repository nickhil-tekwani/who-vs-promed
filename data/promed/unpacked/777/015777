[1] Boosters
Date: Wed 13 Oct 2021

https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/10/13/1045485935/study-of-covid-vaccine-boosters-suggests-moderna-or-pfizer-works-best


If you got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine as your 1st COVID-19 shot, a booster dose of either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine apparently could produce a stronger immune response than a 2nd dose of J&J's vaccine. That's the finding of a highly anticipated study released Wednesday [13 Oct 2021].

And if you started out with either Pfizer or Moderna, it probably doesn't matter that much, the research suggests, as long as you get one of the 2 mRNA vaccines as a booster.

The study, which was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, involved 458 volunteers. They were divided into 9 groups with roughly 50 volunteers in each group. Those who initially got the 2-dose Moderna vaccine got either another Moderna shot, a Pfizer shot or a Johnson & Johnson shot as a booster 4 to 6 months after their primary immunization.

People who got the 2-dose Pfizer vaccine got either another Pfizer shot or a Moderna or J&J booster. And people who got the one-shot J&J vaccine either got another J&J shot or a Moderna or Pfizer booster. The researchers then measured antibody levels in all of those people 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the boost. The results were very interesting.

People who got the Moderna vaccine for their original shots and Moderna again for their booster appear to have gotten the best immune response, followed by those who got Pfizer boosted by Moderna and then Moderna boosted by Pfizer -- although the increase in immune response with the mRNA vaccines was probably too small to really make a difference in protection in most groups.

The most significant finding suggested that people who initially got the J&J vaccine seem to have gotten the best response if they got Pfizer or Moderna as their booster.

In an email to NPR, Nathaniel Landau, a microbiologist at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine, said the findings show that getting a J&J boost after the initial one-shot immunization is "not as good" as receiving one of the other vaccines as a booster. The antibody levels of people in those groups went up 10 -- 20 times higher than in those people who got another J&J shot.

And that antibody increase is probably big enough to make a difference in how much better the protection will be, scientists say. How much better isn't known -- this study wasn't large enough to determine how much less likely people who subsequently got infected with the coronavirus were to get sick -- or how sick they got. But, based on other research, that kind of difference in antibody response probably is enough to offer greater protection.

For its part, J&J said the "study demonstrated that a booster of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine increases immune response regardless of a person's primary vaccination and confirm previously published data on the strong increase of immune response when the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is administered as a booster shot."

There are some caveats to this study that make it a little hard to know how to interpret the data. First, the researchers tested full doses of all the vaccines -- not the half-dose that Moderna is seeking authorization for in its booster.

Also, researchers measured antibody levels 2 and 4 weeks after the booster. So there's a chance antibody levels from a J&J booster could continue to rise with more time. And the scientists are assuming that higher antibody levels translate into more protection. That's probably true, but other factors may also play a role, such as responses by other parts of the immune system.

The researchers also say that their study wasn't designed to compare varying responses among the different booster regimens and that the data set isn't large enough to reach conclusions about one versus the other. Finally, the study findings were posted without peer review on the preprint server medRxiv. [Robert L. Atmar, M.D.*, Kirsten E. Lyke, M.D.*, Meagan E. Deming, et al. Heterologous SARS-CoV-2 Booster Vaccinations - Preliminary Report. medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827]

The results don't come as a complete surprise. Something similar was seen in the U.K. when people who got the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which is similar to the J&J shot -- got boosters.

The data from the NIH study will be reviewed by advisers to the Food and Drug Administration later this week as part of a meeting to consider requests from both Moderna and J&J to authorize booster doses of their vaccines.

The FDA has already authorized a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for anyone older than 65 or whose health, occupation or living situation puts them at risk for severe disease.

[2] Death rate 35-54 yrs

COVID-19 was the leading cause of death among people ages 35 to 54 -- and the 2nd-leading cause overall -- in September [2021], according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Peterson Center on Healthcare.

The research also estimates that since June [2021] more than 90 000 U.S. deaths from COVID-19 could have been prevented with vaccines, and more than half of those occurred last month [Sep 2021].

In January [2021], COVID-19 was the nation's No. 1 cause of death, the analysis found. In July [2021], before the delta surge, COVID-19 briefly dropped to 8th.

[The vaccination rate for 25-39, 40-49, and 50-64 year olds is 57, 65.8, and 73.7% fully vaccinated, respectively (from https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-and-Case-Trends-by-Age-Group-/gxj9-t96f). These percentages are actually better than most of the age groups. So a low vaccination rate does not explain the high death rate 35-54 year olds are experiencing. It may be more behavioral and lack of use of personal protective measures. - Mod LK]

[3] Status of cases and vaccine

COVID-19 cases continue to fall in most world regions, continuing a pattern that started in August [2021], but Europe reported a modest increase, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [Wed 13 Oct 2021] in its weekly pandemic update.

Africa and Western Pacific regions registered the steepest drops in cases. However, new COVID-19 illnesses in Europe were up 7% compared to the previous week [week of 6 Oct 2021]. Nearly half of European countries reported rising cases last week [week of 6 Oct 2021], with the United Kingdom, Turkey, and Russia reporting the highest new-case totals.

Deaths also fell in most of the world's regions, though fatalities increased in Europe by 11% compared to the week before [week of 6 Oct 2021].

Europe and the Americas reported the highest weekly incidence for both cases and deaths. The 5 countries reporting the most cases include the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Russia, and India. No new countries reported the delta (B1617.2) variant, keeping the total at 191. Officials from the WHO's Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) said today at a briefing that though cases in the Americas last week saw an overall decline, they remain high in the US Midwest, Alaska, and northwest Canada. Elsewhere, cases stayed high in Belize and are rising in some Caribbean locations, especially Barbados.

At press briefings today, WHO officials kept the pressure up on vaccine equity. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said 56 countries--mostly from Africa--that were shut out of the global vaccine marketplace weren't able to reach the goal of vaccinating 10% of their populations by the end of September [2021].

He added that 3 countries haven't started vaccinating yet: Burundi, Eritrea, and North Korea.

Tedros warned that even more countries are at risk of missing the target of vaccinating 40% of their populations by the end of the year [2021].

With aggressive and ambitious steps, countries can still meet the goal, he said. "But it takes global cooperation. Countries that continue to roll out boosters now are effectively preventing other countries from vaccinating their most at-risk populations."

PAHO Director Carissa Etienne, MBBS, said overall vaccination rates in Latin America and the Caribbean have reached 39%, but coverage is much lower in some places, especially in some Caribbean islands, Haiti, Guatemala, and Nicaragua. She added that PAHO is working to fast-track donations and urged countries to hire and train health workers to administer doses quickly.

More global headlines
• The WHO today announced a proposed list of 26 members for its new Strategic Group for the Origins of Novel Pathogens (SAGO). Some were members of the joint mission to China to investigate the source of SARS-CoV-2. One member is from the United States: Inger Damon, MD, PhD, who directs the Division of High Consequence Pathogens at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Tedros said that after a 2-week consultation period, the final membership will be confirmed and the group will have its first meeting.

• Northern Syria is experiencing its worst COVID-19 surge, which is overwhelming the health system and exhausting supplies of oxygen and test kits, Doctors Without Borders warned. The group said it is scaling up its response, but urgent assistance is needed to adequately respond [https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/news-stories/news/northern-syrias-most-severe-covid-19-outbreak-overwhelms-health-system].

In other developments, France announced that it will extend its COVID-19 state of emergency until 31 Jul 2022, to allow the government to reimpose measures if needed, according to Reuters [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-france/france-to-extend-covid-19-state-of-emergency-until-july-31-government-says-idUSKBN2H3163].

And in South Korea, officials today [Wed 13 Oct 2021] launched a new panel to devise ways to allow the country to manage virus circulation while reopening the country [https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-launches-panel-debate-living-with-covid-19-2021-10-13/].

• The global total today topped 239 million cases and is now at 239 003 322, along with 4 870 663 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/].
