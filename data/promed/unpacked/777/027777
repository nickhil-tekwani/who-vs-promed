The Public Health Secretary (SESAP) in Rio Grande del Norte (RGN), confirmed the death of a 20-month old boy caused by rabies, which occurred on 30 Aug 2015. According to the agency, the boy lived in Paraiba and received medical care in the RGN public health network.

According to the Subcoordination for Animal Surveillance in SESAP (SUVAN), this case was confirmed last Fri 28 Aug 2015, after tests performed by Pasteur Institute in Sao Paulo. The patient was taken care of in the RGN healthcare network on 20 Aug 2015, when he was brought by his relatives to Monsenor Pedro Moura Hospital in Nova Cruz/RGN, after being bitten by a cat in Jacarau Municipality in Paraiba. When the patient was brought to the hospital, he was dehydrated, and he also was vomiting and had fever, dyspnea, and high blood pressure.

According to SUVAN, the boy was referred on the same day to Varela Santiago Children's Hospital in Natal, since he developed aggressiveness, irritability, and photophobia. Later, he was transferred to Gurgel Manfredo Monsenhoe Hospital, where a CT scan of his brain was performed, and he was admitted into the intensive care unit (ICU).

SESAP reported that in Gurnel Walfredo Hospital, a protocol for treating human rabies was started for this patient, being the same protocol that was used in 2 other cases that survived the infection: one in Floresta, Pernambuco, Brazil in 2008, and the other in Milwaukee, USA, in 2004. The Secretary also reported the case to Paraiba State, who started investigating the place where the boy lived. Four additional persons had been bitten by the sick cat in Jacarau and also the child's father.

The last case of human rabies in RGN was reported in 2010 in Frutuoso Gomes city. At that time, the vector was a vampire bat. According to the State Program for rabies control in SESAP in 2015, 26 animal cases of rabies had been diagnosed in 14 municipalities. These are the following: Acari, Caico, Ceara Mirim, Encanto, Monte Alegre, Navidad, Pau dos Ferros, Pedro Velho, Santana Creek, San Fernando, Sao Gonzalo do Amarante, Serrinha dos Pintos, Teniente Ananias, and Varzeas. Affected animals were mainly cattle (12 cases) and non-hematophagous bats (9 cases). In addition to these animals, there was also one case of a dog affected by rabies in Caico. Other affected animals were pigs, one horse, and one fox.

[With thanks to my colleague Jorge Gonzalez in ProMED-ESP. According to the OIE records, Paraiba only reported one rabies outbreak in 2014, while its neighbour Rio Grande do Norte reported 21, involving 20 cattle, 2 horses, and one dog. In 2013, Paraiba reported 8 outbreaks involving 15 bovine cases, all in all a pattern typical of a vampire bat rabies reservoir. Cats play with sick bats and thus get infected. This newswire reports the infant's fatal case but mentions nothing of any post-exposure treatment for the 5 other people bitten by this rabid cat.

Paraiba is the equally small state adjoining Rio Grand do Norte in the northeast of Brazil; see: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/americas/brazil.jpg. To find Jacarau, go to: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BR/17/Jacarau.html. - Mod.MHJ
