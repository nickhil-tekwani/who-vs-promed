Severe outbreak of bacterial speck, caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv.
_tomato_, on field-grown tomatoes in eastern Anatolia region of Turkey.

In the spring of 1999 and 2000, a serious outbreak of a leaf spot disease
was observed on tomato plants grown in commercial fields in the eastern
Anatolia region of Turkey. It is thought that low temperature and extensive
spring rains encouraged ... disease [development, resulting in
approximately 20% yield loss and lower quality of tomato fruit production.
Initially, symptoms were small (1-2 mm in diameter), water-soaked, dark
brown to black spots which developed on young expanding leaves. Later, a
number of lesions on older leaves, petioles, stems and fruits enlarged and
coalesced, causing leaf desiccation and defoliation.
A fluorescent, gram-negative bacterium was consistently isolated from
diseased tissues onto King's B medium. All of the [20 representative
strains isolated were oxidase and arginine dihydrolase negative, and levan
positive. None of the strains utilized erythritol and L-lactate as the sole
carbon source (Hildebrand et al., 1988; Jones et al., 1986). Fatty acid
analysis identified the strains as _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _tomato_ with
similarity indices ranging from 63 to 94% (Janse et al., 1992).
Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on 5 wk-old tomato seedlings
(cv. Easy Harvest) sprayed with bacterial suspensions containing 108 CFU/ml
of sterile water. Inoculated and sterile-water-sprayed control plants were
covered with polyethylene bags for 48 h at 25 degrees C, then bags were
removed and plants were maintained in the greenhouse. Water-soaked spots
similar to those observed in the field developed on the inoculated plants
within 5-7 days. No symptoms developed on control plants. ... [Bacteria
... reisolated from inoculated plants [were identified as strains of _P.
syringae_ pv. _tomato_.
This is the first report of the occurrence and outbreak of a bacterial
speck disease caused by this bacterium on tomato grown in the eastern
Anatolia region of Turkey. It ... is speculated that contaminated seeds
and/or transplants may have been the source of introduction of the pathogen
to this region.

[Bacterial speck disease of tomato was first observed in Taiwan in 1929. It
has become a major factor limiting tomato production in North America and
presumably wherever the crop is intensively cultivated. This report is
apparently the first to report the disease in ProMED-Plant. Disease
management includes use of seed produced on disease-free plants,
disease-free transplants, crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops for at
least 2-3 years between tomato crops, and resistant cultivars. Proper
sanitation such as disinfecting interior glasshouse surfaces is recommended
before seeding or transplanting.
