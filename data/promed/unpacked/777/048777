USA: norovirus not confirmed as cause of Cornell School District outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests failed to confirm norovirus as the culprit in an illness
outbreak at the Cornell School District [see: Viral gastroenteritis update
2004 (11) 20040325.0833], a health official said on Fri 26 Mar 2004. The
state Health Department tested specimens from 8 people sickened by the
outbreak at the Coraopolis school looking for norovirus, but didn't find
it, Allegheny County Health Department spokesman Guillermo Cole said.

"This does not definitively rule out norovirus. Sometimes it can be
difficult to isolate this virus. It just may not have been in the specimens
that we received," Cole said. "This doesn't change our thinking. We still
strongly believe this outbreak was due to some type of viral infection, and
it could still be a norovirus." Cole said more tests looking for norovirus
and other viruses will take a week to complete. The county Health
Department ruled out bacteria as a cause.

According to the latest figures, 168 people have been affected in the
outbreak, including 126 students, 13 staff members, and 29 of their
relatives. Among students, 90 per cent were of elementary school age. No
new cases have been reported since Tue 23 Mar 2004, when students were
dismissed early and the district shut down, Cole said. "That's evidence the
outbreak is subsiding," he said.

Because a virus is still the suspected cause, Cole said the effort to
disinfect the school building, which houses all of the district's students,
has not been wasted. Superintendent DJ Johnson said the district has hired
a firm to test the building to ensure that no viruses remain after the
cleaning, which started on Thu 25 Mar, is completed. The testing will add
to the cost of decontaminating the school.

Ireland: norovirus outbreak at orthopedic hospital in Cork
----------------------------------------------------------
Visitors were urged to avoid Cork's Orthopedic Hospital on the night of Tue
6 Mar 2004 after the Southern Health Board (SHB) confirmed that it had been
affected by an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug [norovirus infection].
One case of [norovirus infection] has been confirmed at St Mary's
Orthopaedic Hospital in Gurranabraher.

The SHB said it was taking steps to try to prevent the outbreak from
spreading. Visitors to St Mary's are now being limited to direct relatives
of patients only. The SHB has also urged anyone who has been affected by
vomiting or acute diarrhea not to visit the hospital for at least 72 hours
after their last symptoms.

Dr Bartley Cryan, a consultant microbiologist with the SHB, warned that
only strict measures will help contain what is a highly infectious
organism. "Winter vomiting disease is highly infectious, and we are
appealing to people to stay away from the hospital," he said.

[3] Norovirus, assisted-living center - USA (Florida): suspected

Florida: norovirus infection suspected in assisted-living center
----------------------------------------------------------------
Local health officials are investigating an outbreak of viral
gastroenteritis in a Tamarac assisted-living center that sent 16 elderly
residents to the hospital and infected 5 employees. While still waiting for
test results, investigators with the Broward County Health Department
suspect Merrill Gardens, 7650 N University Drive, was affected by a
norovirus outbreak.

Symptoms, which usually run their course in 24 to 48 hours, include
vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. "Everything else we tested for came back
negative, so we think this is [a norovirus outbreak]," said Karen LaFleur,
the department's environmental health program consultant. Highly
contagious, norovirus infection is known to spread rapidly in places where
people are living closely together, and there have been outbreaks in South
Florida retirement homes before, LaFleur said.

The 1st Merrill Gardens case was detected 1 Apr 2004, and several other
senior citizens soon were sick. General manager Sid Rosenblatt, who also
contracted the virus, said the infected were sent to University Hospital
and Medical Center in Tamarac in order to contain the outbreak. Uninfected
residents were asked to remain in their rooms until the center, which
houses 88 elders, could be inspected and sanitized. Rosenblatt said Merrill
Gardens resumed normal operations on Tue 6 Apr and that most of those
admitted to hospital were back home.

Merrill Gardens' infection rate was low, LaFleur said, possibly because
afflicted residents were isolated early. A 50 per cent infection rate is
common. Health officials don't know how the outbreak began. Merrill
Garden's kitchen has been cleared by investigators, Rosenblatt said. The
virus can come from improperly stored or prepared food. But Tim O'Connor,
spokesman for the Palm Beach County Health Department, said the outbreaks
in his region's assisted-living centers and nursing homes typically are
brought in from the outside.

Scotland: viral gastroenteritis outbreak hits hotel guests
----------------------------------------------------------
An investigation is under way into an outbreak of gastric flu at one of
Scotland's plushest hotels. The five-star Cameron House Hotel on the banks
of Loch Lomond has played host to a number of top celebrities. But staff
and visitors at the luxury location have been issued a letter warning them
that some guests had been struck down by diarrhea and vomiting.
