Yemen: Confirmed polio cases reach 300
---------------------------------------------
Although the number of confirmed polio cases in Yemen has soared to
300, a massive immunization campaign starting on 12 Jul [2005] should
go a long way to reducing further infections, the World Health
Organization (WHO) representative for Yemen, Dr. Hashim Al-Zain, said
in the capital, Sana.

The polio outbreak was confirmed in mid-May [2005] after 18 cases
were reported, following the completion of a routine national
immunization program conducted in April [2005].

"The number of polio virus cases has gone up to 300, across 17
provinces. We got the most recent results on 29 Jun [2005]. The
governorate of Hodeidah (226 km west of the capital) was the worst
affected area, with 197 cases," Al-Zain added.

The WHO official pointed out that the spread of the virus was
directly related to the lack of proper immunization in Yemen.

"The virus hit 17 provinces so badly because there has been low
vaccination, particularly in places like Hodeidah. Therefore, the
virus has found a good environment to grow," Al-Zain explained.

Polio is a highly infectious viral disease that invades the nervous
system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) and the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control (CDC) will
collaborate on the 3-day nationwide vaccination starting on 12 Jul
2005. This drive will be the 2nd of 2 vaccination rounds and will
target some 3 million people, including 800 000 children below the
age of 5.

Minister of Health Mohammed Al-Nomai and UNICEF communications
coordinator Naseem Ur-Rehman earlier denied reports that the reason
for the increase in cases was the lack of safe vaccines.

"The safety of the vaccines is completely ensured from their entrance
into the country to their delivery to the children's mouths,"
Ur-Rehman said. He urged the media to contribute to making the
campaign a success.

Al-Nomee has said that such reports had influenced some parents
against taking their children to be vaccinated.

It has been reported that the crippling disease spread from Nigeria
to 12 other African countries, including Sudan. From there, it was
imported to Saudi Arabia, health officials said.

"I think this virus was definitely brought to Yemen, because we had
no problem [with polio] for the last 6 years. If the virus was
indigenous, we would have seen it within the last 6 years," the
Yemeni health official explained earlier.

There are only 6 countries in the world considered polio-endemic:
Nigeria, India, Pakistan, Niger, Afghanistan and Egypt. A total of
1266 cases of polio were reported worldwide in 2004, according to the
WHO. Yemen was designated polio free by the WHO in 1996.

[According to the polio eradication website
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>,
as of 29 Jun 2005, there had been 284 confirmed cases of polio in
Yemen. The mention of over 300 cases above may reflect additional
laboratory confirmations that were received after the polio
eradication website was updated on 29 Jun 2005. The above newswire
gives a good assessment of the unfortunate situation in terms of a
reintroduction of the wild poliovirus into an environment where
vaccination coverage had fallen to low levels, resulting in large
pockets of susceptible people through which widespread
transmission/circulation of the wild poliovirus could (and did) occur.

From the June 2005 monthly situational update discussion from the
polio eradication website:

"* NIDs [National Immunization Days] began 30 May [2005], using 6
million doses of mOPV1 [monovalent type-1 oral polio vaccine] to
interrupt transmission more quickly in house-to-house rounds with 32
000 vaccinators.

* The case numbers from the outbreak in Yemen reached 179 by the end
of May [2005]. Yemen suffered multiple importations into Hodaidah
governorate, a port-town with frequent population movements across
the Red Sea. The relatively low routine immunization in Yemen is
behind the rapid spread of the virus.

* 12 of the 22 governorates of the country have reported cases, 75
percent in Hodeidah. This focalization suggests that the preventive
campaign in April [2005] helped prevent even further spread. The next
SIAs in Yemen are planned for 11 Jul [2005].

One hopes that the planned national immunization days will reach
sufficient levels of the population to interrupt transmission of the
wild poliovirus through a "flooding" of the environment with vaccine
virus. - Mod.MPP]
