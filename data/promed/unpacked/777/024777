BRITAIN PREDICTS BSE WILL BE INSIGNIFICANT BY 2001
LONDON -- The U.K. agriculture ministry was cited as saying in a BSE
progress report that latest figures suggest the epidemic of mad cow disease
in Britain's cattle herds will dwindle to an insignificant level by the year
2001, adding, "A continued improvement is expected for the future ...
Forecasts that the BSE epidemic will decline to an insignificant level by
the year 2001...remain unchanged."
The report showed the number of suspected BSE cases reported in 1997 was
5,547, and the number of confirmed cases in the first 11 months of the year
was 3,410. This compared with 10,701 suspected cases in 1996, and 8,016
confirmed cases in the whole of that year.
In the peak year of the disease, 1992, there were 44,846 suspected and
36,682 confirmed cases.
[My own analysis of the epidemic indicates 2005-2010 as a more reasonable
"insignificant" time-frame. Hopefully the UK experts will prove out in the
end. -- RAL]

[Using the 1996 percentage, 74.9%, of confirmed cases, the confirmed total
for 1997 might be 4,155 cases. But it should be noticed that this percentage
has been falling recently, for example it was 81.8% in 1992, which had been
a fairly consistent level over a number of previous years, so it might be
somewhere around 3,700 cases. - Mod.MHJ]
