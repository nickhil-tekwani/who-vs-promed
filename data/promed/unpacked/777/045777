NK Requests Seoul's Help to Fight Bird Flu
-----------------------------------------------------
North Korea on Friday [8 Apr 2005] thanked South Korea for its offer to
help contain an outbreak of bird flu at 3 chicken farms in Pyongyang and
requested that Seoul provide equipment and medical supplies, the
Unification Ministry said.
South Korea's National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service received
a telephone call from its Northern counterpart, responding 10 days after
Seoul first offered assistance.
"North Korea expressed appreciation and said it hoped the South will
provide the necessary equipment and medicine," the ministry said in a media
release.
It said the ministry will discuss the request with other government
departments and agencies before responding.
South Korea offered to provide assistance to the North through a telephone
communication at the border village of Panmunjom on 29 Mar 2005.
But the North appeared to ignore the offer, instead working with U.N.
agency officials to tackle the virus.
The Unification Ministry also said the North had conducted 2 genetic tests
to confirm the outbreak was of the H7 strain, not the H5N1 virus that has
claimed more than 50 lives in Southeast Asia since late 2003.
Pyongyang officials believed the virus was spread by migratory birds, it said.
The Food and Agriculture Organization earlier confirmed that no new cases
of bird flu have been reported in North Korea since authorities culled
about 210 000 chickens late last month [March 2005]. No human infection has
been detected.
However, experts have raised concerns that H7-infected birds could come in
contact with H5N1 and create a lethal, fast-spreading hybrid.
