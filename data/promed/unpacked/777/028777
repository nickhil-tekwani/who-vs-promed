Nearly 160 people have been diagnosed with malaria in Jamaica's first
outbreak of the disease in 4 decades, health officials said Wednesday
[27 Dec 2006]. No deaths have been reported since the outbreak was
confirmed 30 Nov 2006, said Marion Bullock-Ducasse, the ministry's
director of emergency services. The ministry urged people showing
malaria symptoms to seek treatment.
Health officials said the number of new cases have been dwindling in
recent days. Most cases have been detected in densely populated slums
of west Kingston, Bullock-Ducasse said. Others have been found in the
parishes of St. Catherine and Clarendon, just outside the Jamaican
capital. There have been no reports of malaria in Jamaica's main
resort areas, health officials said.
Crews have sprayed pesticides and cleared stagnant water around
Kingston to fight the outbreak, the Caribbean island's first since
1965. Malaria, one of the world's deadliest diseases, kills about 1
million children a year in poor countries with warm, damp climates
ideal for the mosquitoes that transmit the parasite that [causes] the disease.

[ProMED thanks Brent Barrett for submitting this report. We hope that
the statement from the Jamaican authorities that the number of cases
is declining reflects control over the outbreak. The measures taken
by the Ministry of Health can be followed at
<http://www.moh.gov.jm/LatestNews.html>, which unfortunately does not
include any figures on the number of cases recorded week by week. - Mod.EP]
