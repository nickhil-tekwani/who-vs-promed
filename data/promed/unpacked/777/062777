Canada: Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreak Closes Hospital in Montreal
------------------------------------------------------------------
Montreal's Lakeshore Hospital has shut its doors to new patients until at
least Wednesday after an outbreak of gastroenteritis affected several
patients and staff, hospital officials said on Sat 2 Nov 2002. The epidemic
has affected 57 patients and 35 staff, but officials expect those numbers
to rise.
"You must understand that since this is very contagious, there is possibly,
or even probably, other patients who are in incubation, meaning they have
the virus but haven't shown any symptoms yet," said Dr. Jacques Nadeau,
director of professional services at Lakeshore Hospital. "The numbers may
possibly rise, it could go as high as half the patients who used the hospital."
Gastroenteritis is not deadly and is usually cleared up within 2 or 3 days,
according to the Canadian Medical Association. Symptoms include nausea,
vomiting and diarrhea. The virus originated in the hospital's emergency
room and quickly spread to all floors of the west-end building, forcing its
closure late Friday night.
