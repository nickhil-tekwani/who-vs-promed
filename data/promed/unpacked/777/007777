Outbreaks of VTEC O157 infection in inmates of 2 prisons in the United Kingdom
--------------------------------------
Thirty-seven inmates at Guys Marsh Prison in Dorset in the south of
England have been infected with _Escherichia coli_ O157 in the past month.
Twenty-nine developed abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea between 15
and 27 Sep 2000. A further 2 became ill on 6 & 7 Oct 2000. Infection
has also been detected in 6 asymptomatic inmates who work as kitchen
staff or serve food. In Swansea Prison, 8 inmates have been
diagnosed with _E. coli_ O157 infection. All 8 occupied the same 37
bed wing in the prison. Three developed bloody diarrhoea on 12
Sep 2000, the other 5 were asymptomatic carriers identified after
screening all staff and inmates on the wing. Three of the 5 carriers
are responsible for serving food to other prisoners.
The Public Health Laboratory Service Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens has
confirmed the isolates from this outbreak to be _E. coli_ O157, phage type
8, Vero cytotoxin types 1 and 2. The 'outbreak' strain from the 2
prisons are indistinguishable by pulsed field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE), but differ from PFGE profiles of other isolates from general
outbreaks in England and Wales. This suggests that the outbreaks in the
2 prisons are linked.
A case control study of the Dorset outbreak is being carried out by
Dorset Health Authority to identify vehicles or modes of transmission.
Possible connections between the 2 prisons are being investigated,
including the movement of both prisoners and staff. Food sources
identified as common to both prisons are being investigated by
environmental health officers in North Dorset and Swansea.

Health Authority, Ferndown, Dorset, England; and Brendan Mason, Lechyd
