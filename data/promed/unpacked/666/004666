Bird flu has reared its head again in 2 Mekong Delta provinces, Bac
Lieu and Ca Mau, after over one year during which Vietnam managed to
keep the epidemic out.
At a conference held Tuesday [19 Dec 2006] by the National Steering
Committee on Bird Flu Control, Cao Duc Phat, Minister of Agriculture
and Rural Development and the committee's head, slammed the 2
provincial administrations for negligence and delay in discovering
the outbreaks which had occurred at the start of December [2006].
On 6 Dec 2006 the disease broke out in Ca Mau's Tran Van Thoi
district, killing 2520 chicks and ducklings, all of which later
[found] positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu virus.
The next day 5 duck flocks took ill in Hoa Binh district in Bac Lieu.
Some 3500 ducklings died, all of which too tested positive for H5N1.
The committee claimed the dead birds had not been vaccinated because
they had been hatched illegally.
There is a real threat now of the disease spreading to other places
since the farmers threw away the birds' carcasses before the outbreak
came to light.
The current cool weather is an ally for the virus.
Phat instructed the 2 provinces to quickly quarantine and sterilize
their infected areas, and others to maintain extreme vigilance.
He also directed local agencies to find out the cause of the
outbreaks since there were no reports of recurrence in areas
neighboring the 2 provinces.
If any new infections occurred, Phat warned, the local
administrations would be held responsible.
No new cases were reported in the last 13 months in Vietnam while
some 140 million poultry were vaccinated against H5N1.
Bird flu has been detected in more than 50 countries and 154 people have died.
In Vietnam 93 people have been infected by bird flu, with 42
fatalities reported since the disease first appeared in December 2003.

Vietnam on Tuesday [19 Dec 2006] confirmed 2 new outbreaks of bird
flu in domestic poultry, the first in more than a year in the country
once hardest-hit by the deadly H5N1 strain.
Thousands of chickens and ducks will be slaughtered in 2 Mekong Delta
provinces to prevent the spread of the disease, which has killed 158
people and hundreds of millions of chickens worldwide.
The H5N1 strain of bird flu is not easily contagious among humans,
but scientists fear if it is left unchecked it could mutate into a
new human influenza pandemic strain, threatening the lives of
millions of people who would have no natural immunity.
Earlier this year, Vietnam -- which has seen 42 people die from bird
flu since 2003 -- declared it had brought bird flu under control
through an aggressive programme of vaccinations.
No deaths have been reported in either poultry or humans since November 2005.
However, the mass deaths of chickens and ducks last week in southern
Ca Mau and Bac Lieu provinces prompted tests that were positive for
the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, according to Hoang Van Nam,
director of the Epidemic Unit under Vietnam's Department for Animal
Health.
"The farms where poultry was found dead have been ordered to cull all
the live poultry and to disinfect all the areas surrounding," Nam
said.
The dead chickens and ducks -- most just one month old -- had
apparently been hatched illegally and had not been vaccinated, he
added.
"The possibility that the outbreaks will spread to other farms is
very high, especially to the farms where the poultry has not been
vaccinated," Nam said. "The farmers didn't report to local animal
officials about the death of the poultry at first hand until the
number of dead poultry is so high."
Vietnam was the epicentre of the H5N1 crisis when the virus
re-emerged in 2003, with millions of poultry dead and more human
victims -- eventually 42 -- than anywhere in the world at one point.
After the vaccination programme controlled the virus in poultry,
Indonesia overtook Vietnam as the hardest-hit by the disease, with 57
people dead as of this month.
Vietnam has vaccinated 83 million chickens and 43 million ducks in
the 2nd vaccination round in 2006.
Health experts hope to control the virus in poultry because contact
with diseased birds is the main way humans can catch the deadly
disease -- which has killed about 60 per cent of people known to have
contracted the virus.

This is disappointing piece of news for Viet Nam -- which has
invested considerable efforts in the control of avian influenza, with
impressive achievements following its initial failures -- and for the
region. The outbreak, reportedly affecting unvaccinated, illegally
maintained poultry, might be indicative of the continued circulation
of the virus in Viet Nam, either within the remaining, limited
unvaccinated domestic avian populations or in wild birds. - Mod.AS]
[The curiosity here is the question wondering where this came from.
The newswire does mention that the flocks involved were "illegally
hatched" and were not vaccinated. One wonders if the introduction of
the H5N1 virus into the area was a result of transmission from
migrant avians or was a result of human migration with illegally
transported avians from other infected areas. According to the most
recent information available on the OIE website
<http://www.oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>
H5N1 activity has not been reported in Southeast Asia since 1 Nov
2006. The most recent report of H5N1 activity in East Asia was a
report in late November 2006 from South Korea. Are the neighboring
countries to Viet Nam really free of H5N1 or has there been low level
activity occurring in small flocks that has not as yet come to the
attention of the official sector? One does wonder if the agricultural
sector in the Southeast Asian countries are aware of suspected
outbreaks that have not as yet been confirmed. - Mod.MPP]
