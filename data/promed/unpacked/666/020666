Two more cases were classified as "suspected" by the Department of Health,
making the total number of influenza A H5N1 cases in human nine.
The two latest cases involved a two year old boy and a three year old girl
who were cousins of a confirmed case (5 year-old girl). They had mild
symptoms only and were now receiving treatment in hospital. Their
conditions were satisfactory.

[Of course, new cases are not good news. Neither is apparent transmission
between family members although exposure of all three children to common
source has not been ruled out and may be difficult to ever rule out. We are
all in a "wait and hold our collective breath mode". However, it is useful
to remember Dr. Margaret Chan's comments that the efficiency of
human-to-human transmission is probably not very great otherwise we would
be seeing many more human cases by now. Let's hope it stays that way. - Mod.PC
