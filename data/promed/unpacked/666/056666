Beijing scientists said in a medical journal to be published Thu [22
Jun 2006] that a man in mainland China died of bird flu in November
2003, 2 years before the communist country reported any human
infections to the World Health Organization. On Wednesday, however,
the scientists asked without explanation to withdraw the report. But
it was too late.
The man's death was initially thought to have been caused by SARS,
the scientists wrote. That suggests some other cases attributed to
SARS may have actually been the deadly H5N1 avian influenza, and also
raises questions about how candid China has been about both diseases.
"It's hard to believe that this is the only person in all of China
who developed H5N1" that year, said Dr. John Treanor, a flu expert at
the University of Rochester.
WHO was surprised by the report, which came not from the Chinese
government but from 8 scientists in a research letter to the New
England Journal of Medicine. "We will formally request the Ministry
of Health to clarify this," and why it has taken more than 2 years to
come to light, said Roy Wadia, a WHO spokesman in China.
At least one scientist e-mailed the journal on Wednesday morning [21
Jun 2006], asking that the report be withdrawn, but it was already in
print, a journal spokeswoman said. The journal said it was waiting to
see whether the authors would now retract the paper.
The Beijing case does not necessarily mean the world faces any
greater danger of a pandemic; bird flu does not spread easily from
person to person, and nearly all human cases have involved close
contact with infected poultry. But the report raises questions about
the ability and willingness of scientists in China to study it.
Dr. Lindsey Baden, a New England Journal editor, said he does not
know what caused the delay in reporting the case but suspects it took
time for scientists to realize they had a novel H5N1 strain and to do
the genetic sequencing needed to analyze it. "It's to be praised
that they are doing this kind of work and sharing it," Baden said,
reports Associated Press.

[The report of an H5N1 human infection in China occurring in November
2003 is not surprising. During the early stages of pubic reports on
the outbreak of respiratory syndrome in Guangdong China (later on
being named the Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)), there were
2 cases of H5N1 (in a father and son) diagnosed in Hong Kong in Feb
2003 with history of travel to Fujian province. There was also a
presumed 3rd case (a daughter from the same family) that became ill
and died in Fujian province, with no further diagnostic testing
done. The mother of this family also had a severe respiratory
illness but the final diagnosis on her was "thought to have been a
parainfluenza infection" (see ProMED-mail posting Influenza, H5N1
human case - China (Hong Kong) (04) 20030227.0491). Hence, one
surmises that there had been H5N1 activity in Fujian province
during the SARS outbreak as well. (see prior ProMED-mail postings
for 2003 listed below). - Mod.MPP]
[The pdf version of the New England Journal of Medicine letter
referred to above can be accessed at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/354/25/2731.pdf>. The reference
is: New England Journal of Medicine, volume 354 , No. 25, 2731-2732,
Jun 22, 2006.
The letter reads as follows:
"To the Editor: A 24-year-old man had pneumonia and respiratory
distress in November 2003 and died 4 days after being hospitalized.
Because the clinical manifestations were consistent with those of the
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and occurred when sporadic
cases of SARS were described in southern China (ref 1), serum and
lung tissue from the patient, as well as fluid aspirated from his
chest, were examined for SARS coronavirus with the use of indirect
fluorescence antibody tests and the reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). All tests were negative for SARS.
A virus was isolated from the lung tissue in Vero-cell cultures and
was characteristic of influenza A virus on electron microscopy. A
serum sample collected on day 8 of the patient's illness was positive
for IgM antibody against the isolated virus. Fragments of both the
influenza A virus matrix gene (M) and the H5-subtype hemagglutinin
gene (HA) were amplified from the infected Vero cells with the use of
RT-PCR assay (ref 2,3). The nucleotide sequences of the fragments
were identical to those amplified from the stored specimens of the
patient's serum, chest fluid, and lung tissue.
The genomic sequence of the virus (A/Beijing/01/2003) was determined,
and its 8 segments were genetically related most closely to
corresponding sequences of influenza A (H5N1) viruses that had been
isolated from chickens in various regions of China in 2004. The
segments of the polymerase basic protein 1 gene (PB1) and the
nonstructural gene (NS) were most closely related to those from
Guangdong Province (in southeastern China), with 99 percent identity.
The segments of the polymerase basic protein 2 gene (PB2) and HA gene
were closest to those from Jilin Province (in northeastern China),
with 99 and 97 percent identity, respectively. The segments of the
neuraminidase gene (NA), nucleoprotein gene (NP), and M gene were
closest to those from Hubei Province (in mideastern China), with 98,
98, and 99 percent identity, respectively, and the polymerase acidic
protein gene (PA) segment was closest to that from Japan, with 99
percent identity.
These findings suggest that influenza A/Beijing/01/2003 may be a
mixed virus. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA and NA genes of the
representative influenza A (H5N1) strains have revealed that the
viruses isolated from patients in Thailand and Viet Nam in 2004 and
2005 belong to the same clade, and those obtained from patients in
Hong Kong in 1997 and 1998 are from another clade (Figure 1 in the
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter
at <http://www.nejm.org>). A sample of virus obtained from a patient
in Hong Kong in 2003 seems to represent a transitional genotype, of
which the HA gene sequence was close to the cluster from southeastern
Asia (Figure 1A in the Supplementary Appendix), whereas the NA gene
sequence was close to that of the cluster from Hong Kong in 1997 and
1998 (Figure 1B in the Supplementary Appendix). Phylogenetic analyses
of the HA or NA gene indicated that the influenza /Beijing/01/2003
strain was genetically distant from viruses previously isolated from
humans, although it appears to have originated from a lineage similar
to the influenza A/goose/Guangdong/1/96 (Gs/GD) lineage (ref 4).
These findings have important implications for selecting viruses for
the development of vaccines to prevent infection in humans. The
genetic distance between the isolate reported and the strain
currently proposed for vaccine development (A/Vietnam/1203/2004)5
implies that viruses from different regions may need to be considered
in the development of an effective vaccine against influenza A virus.

[This appears to be a leaked report of part of the the proceedings of
the FAO, WHO, MOH consultative Meeting in progress in Indonesia from
21 to 23 Jun 2006 - see ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human (87)
- Indonesia 20060620.1701. - Mod.CP]

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has concluded that human-to-human
transmission likely occurred among 7 relatives who developed bird flu
in Indonesia. In a report obtained by Associated Press, WHO experts
said the cluster's index case was probably infected by sick birds and
spread the disease to 6 family members. One of those cases, a boy,
then likely infected his father, it said. The WHO stressed that the
virus has not mutated and that no cases were detected beyond the family.
Seven of the 8 relatives died [in May 2006], but one was buried
before samples could be taken to confirm bird flu infection. "Six
confirmed H5N1 cases likely acquired (the) H5N1 virus through
human-to-human transmission from the index case ... during close
prolonged contact with her during the late stages of her illness,"
the report said.
The report was distributed at a closed meeting in Jakarta attended by
some of the world's top bird flu experts. The experts were expected
to discuss the large family cluster during the session. One of the
remaining mysteries is why only blood relatives -- not spouses --
became infected. The 3-day session was convened after Indonesia asked
for international help. The country has recorded the world's highest
number of human bird flu cases [so far in 2006], and 39 of those
infected have died.
The WHO report theorizes the family shared a "common genetic
predisposition to infection with H5N1 virus with severe and fatal
outcomes. However, there is no evidence to support that.
Keiji Fukuda, WHO's coordinator for the Global Influenza Program in
Geneva, said the Indonesian case appears to resemble other family
clusters where limited human-to-human transmission occurred following
close contact. He said scientists must find out whether anything is
different about the way the virus is behaving. "The really critical
factor is why did that cluster develop?" he said. "What's the reason
why people in a cluster got infected?"
Fukuda said that although the cluster in the farming village on
Sumatra island grabbed world attention, no country -- including Viet
Nam and Thailand, which have largely controlled the virus -- is safe
from bird flu. "This is a virus that you both have to respect a lot
and (you) have to be concerned about the overall situation, even in
areas in which it looks like control has been achieved," he said on
the meeting's sidelines. "The real question is: Can you sustain that
control for a virus which is really able to persist this way?"
Indonesian officials said the country lacks manpower and money to
battle the H5N1 virus alone. The government has been saddled with a
series of natural disasters, including the 2004 tsunami and an
earthquake [in May 2006] on Java Island. Indonesia needs $50 million
from donors in the next 3 years to establish a system to help fight
bird flu in poultry, according to Peter Roeder of the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization. Indonesia has said it needs $900 million
over the next 3 years for its overall battle against the H5N1 virus
but has only budgeted $59 million.
