People living in Campana community, Capira District, Western Panama are becoming increasingly concerned because of 150 new cases of leishmaniasis in both children and adults.

A 25-year-old pregnant woman presented with many lesions on different parts of her body. She said that everything started after being bitten by a mosquito.

"Since the lesions were itchy, I scratched them over and over until an ulcer developed, and lesions started increasing their size," she added. She also mentioned that she cannot receive the injections that are being administered to most of the infected persons. "Healthcare authorities recommended the use of patches as a palliative medication," she added.

Another person living in Cerro Campana who is also affected by this disease pointed out that the injections he is being administered in the health center do not seem to control the infection he has. Almost in tears, he begged for a solution to his situation, since he is quite ill and affected because of the mosquito bites. He also added that officers from the Ministry of Health have not gone to the community. "We have to spend money on bus tickets in order to reach the health center and have the injections administered. The good thing is that the medicine is free," he added.

One of the inhabitants declared that she is concerned about her granddaughter, who is 11 years old and was diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis, a condition that is affecting one of her legs. She said that she does not know the cause of this condition, but she pointed out that the disease is transmitted by a bug that bites sloths. She said that a physician in Capira community recommended a medication that is administered every 3 hours for 20 days [sic].

Due to this worrisome situation, Mr. Gabriel Tunon, a local representative from Campana community, pointed out that local authorities are carrying out an aggressive program for following up the aforementioned disease with the aid of American organizations in order to control this situation.

He also pointed out that the disease spread to other neighboring communities, such as Las Ollas, Caimito and even Arraijan, whose inhabitants come to Campana seeking medical care.

Mr. Tunon said that this is not a mild disease, so healthcare authorities should pay more attention to this condition. He criticized the insufficient aid brought in by the Ministry of Health for affected persons and communities.

"Health officers performed fumigation campaigns approximately 6 weeks ago, but they did not finish it, and they never came back," he added. Mr. Tunon regretted that the Capira vector control office does not have portable pumps or backpacks for fumigation in the affected communities.

After complaints from Cerro Campana community inhabitants because of the occurrence of 150 cases of leishmaniasis, Dr. Eric Lopez, Regional Health Director in West Panama, declared that every year at the end of March, an outbreak of leishmaniasis is an expected occurrence. He mentioned that his institution is prepared to handle the situation. He added that programs and recommendations are readily available.

Dr. Lopez admitted that leishmaniasis is an endemic problem that has always been present in Capira region. He also mentioned that in the past few years, diagnostic methods have improved so affected persons may be recognized early.

[The leishmania parasite is transmitted by sand flies (_Diptera_, _Psychodidae_, _Phlebotominae_) of the genus _Lutzomyia_ in the New World, not mosquitoes as stated in the text. Dogs are the main reservoir.

Leishmaniasis is an increasing public health problem in Panama. One study found that the predominant species was _L. (Viannia) panamensis_ and found evidence of peridomestic and/or domestic transmission. Mucosal involvement was observed in 4.2 percent of the patients. The overall natural infection rate with _Leishmania_ in 103 pools of sandflies was 0.46 percent (Azpurua J et al. Lutzomyia. Sand fly diversity and rates of infection by Wolbachia and an exotic Leishmania species on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2010;4:e627). - Mod.EP
