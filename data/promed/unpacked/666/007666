Just letting you know that we have another case here in MN. About 1 mile
from the first site. As of Saturday, only one death. Producer really on
the ball, removed herd from pasture that day and treated with long acting
Penicillin that evening. Will vaccinate 10 days later. Looks like
conditions are right for a repeat of 2000 [refers to events of last year.
