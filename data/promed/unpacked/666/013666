SHEEP CLONING AND DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY
========================================
Date: Thu, 27 Feb 1997 23:38:35 -0500 (EST)
From: "Simon J. Elliott" <selliott@umabnet.ab.umd.edu>
With the recent claim that a sheep has been cloned, there has been much
excitement and speculation over the possibility of cloning animals and
people. Technical, ethical and economic issues aside, there seems to be an
important limitation imposed by infectious disease. A group of 1000
genetically identical individuals could all be killed by one particular
disease that their MHC is most susceptible to. Worse, such a group would
experience the magnification of pathogenicity as the agent passes into the
next identical
individual with influenza, for example, becoming hyper-virulent and lethal.
There is evidence for this in plant monocultures, and in highly inbred lab
animals. Can anyone provide examples of where inbreeding has caused a
population of wild animals or people to be severely affected by a
particular infectious agent?
[I have held this one for a few days to let the furor die down and see if
others had comments to make. Simon Elliott has an interesting point and
there has long been concern over genetic diversity particularly in the
poultry industry and in the swine industry. Any specific examples or
thoughts? - Mod. pc]
