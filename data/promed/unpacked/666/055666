The Republic of Ireland (ROI) is the latest country to become infected with
the virus of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS). Ireland
is one of the few countries in the world that has remained free of PRRS
virus (PRRSV) during its global spread of the 1980s and 1990s. Most
countries in the European Union became infected in the years 1990-92. The
Irish pig industry and Ministry of Agriculture have in recent years
maintained a stringent voluntary code of practice to safeguard against
importation of the virus, but unfortunately the Province of Northern Ireland
(part of the United Kingdom) became infected in 1996, allegedly as a result
of semen or live pig imports from the U.K. The Northern Ireland Dept. of
Agriculture (DANI) introduced a herd accreditation scheme (for PRRS freedom)
in January 1998, partly to facilitate safe trade in breeding pigs to the
Republic, but once Northern Ireland was infected, many of us expected that
it would be only a matter of time before the virus crossed the border.
We have now received reports from veterinary practices in the Republic, that
PRRSV infection has been confirmed clinically and serologically on a number
of farms in County Cavan, just south of the border with the Province of
Northern Ireland. Clinical signs are reported to be mild -- a common
finding with PRRSV in newly-infected countries. Local reports suggest that
the virus has probably been introduced into Ireland via cross-border imports
of weaner ("nursery") pigs. Prices of weaner pigs in N. Ireland have been
at their lowest for some decades during the past year. Farmers in Ireland
were aware of the risk of importing PRRS, but were allegedly tempted by the
bargain prices.
There are approximately 185 000 breeding sows in the Republic. Almost half
of the Republic's pig production is exported: mostly to the U.K., but also
to Germany, France, Italy and Japan. PRRSV is an Arterivirus, related to
equine arteritis virus (EAV), but only known to infect pigs and some species
of birds. If anyone would like further information about PRRS, please
