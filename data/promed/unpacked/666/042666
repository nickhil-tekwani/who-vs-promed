An ongoing swine flu [influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection] outbreak in Mexico has left at least 29 people dead and nearly 1500 others infected, health officials confirmed on Saturday [29 Jan 2012]. Thousands more are also ill as the country faces several types of influenza this season [2011-2012].

Since the start of the ongoing winter season [2011-2012], at least 7069 people have reported suffering from symptoms similar to those of swine flu [influenza A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection]. Lab tests are still underway and have so far confirmed 1456 cases of the disease [swine flu], which is officially known as A/H1N1pdm09 virus infection. According to Mexico's Health Ministry (SSA), at least 29 people have died of swine flu so far this season. While no health emergency has been declared, officials expect the death toll will rise in the coming weeks as Mexico also faces A/H3N2 and B type influenza [virus infection].

The A/H1N1pdm influenza virus emerged in the Mexican state of Veracruz in April 2009 and quickly spread around the world, causing the World Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a global flu pandemic in June 2009. At least 18 000 people have died of the disease since, although the actual number is believed to be far higher.

In August 2010, the WHO declared that the swine flu pandemic was over. "In the post-pandemic period, influenza disease activity will have returned to levels normally seen for seasonal influenza," the WHO said at the time. "It is expected that the pandemic virus will behave as a seasonal influenza A virus [replacing the previous A/H1N1) influenza virus."

[The most recent WHO update [see: Influenza (03): WHO update 20120120.1016834] reported that the viruses detected throughout the northern hemisphere temperate zone have been predominantly of the A(H3N2) subtype. Only very small numbers of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been reported in recent weeks. Countries in the tropical zone reported low levels of influenza activity except for Costa Rica, which is primarily detecting influenza A(H3N2). Influenza activity in the temperate countries of the southern hemisphere is at inter-seasonal levels, though Chile and Australia both report persistent transmission of A(H3N2) with smaller numbers of influenza type B in Australia.

Mexico, the source of the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic, seems to be deviating from the above pattern by reporting an appreciable number of cases and deaths as a result of influenza A/(H1N1)pdm09 virus infection (swine flu).
