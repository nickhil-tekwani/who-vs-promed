Further Information from Jonathan Geddes
-----------------------------------------------------
[This is] what we found in our recent 3-day trip to investigate the
reports of an anthrax outbreak in southern Mursiland. Because of the
lack of road access to that area, supplies of protective clothing,
food and water, as well as gear for taking samples and making blood
smears, all had to be carried with us along foot tracks for at least
40 km to reach the target site at Doli.
In Maiholi, Bulukurugirong, and Ngawunya we were fortunate to find 5
eye-witnesses who had been present at Shiginger at the time of the
outbreak, including a man and woman who had arrived from there that
very morning. In separate interviews they all claimed that the
disease outbreak took place a month ago in Shiginger, a Mursi camp on
the eastern side of the Mursi mountains near the Omo river. They
supplied details of mortalities and sickness among Mursi and
livestock. Sicknesses reported in other locations were incidental and
unrelated to the anthrax outbreak.
Apparently a number of people in the Shiginger area had been
developing skin lesions on the hands and shoulders after skinning and
carrying the meat from lesser kudu that they had found dead in the
bush. Some of these people ate meat from the lesser kudu carcasses
and at least one of those died. One man from the Ariholi territorial
grouping who had been in Shiginger at the time lost 5 of his cattle.
The first he noticed to be lethargic and inappetant mid-afternoon so
he bled it and a local boy drank the blood. By evening the beast was
recumbent and that night it died, along with the boy who had drunk
its blood. Meanwhile, people who butchered other cattle that had
died rapidly developed swelling and cutaneous lesions where fluid
from the meat had contacted their skin. One such man died. Some
people ate the meat of the affected cattle and developed abdominal
pain after which 3 died, while others survived.
When it became obvious what was going on, the Mursi fled with all
their cattle to the Kiwoi area just over the Mursi mountains to the
west. Contrary to initial reports from Mursi informants, apparently
no more anthrax-related sickness or deaths in humans or cattle have
occurred in Kiwoi or Doli since then. Because of this we were unable
to take samples or make blood smears as we had intended (the only
anthrax survivor that we met had an intra-abdominal problem that
could not be sampled or smeared and was unwilling to return with us
for further investigation).
Despite the lack of laboratory confirmation, the history and reported
details of this disease outbreak fit very well with what we know of
bovine and human anthrax. Some confusion was caused by inaccurate
information and very vague description of symptoms by Mursi
informants. The generalised body swelling that was reported (and
seemed uncharacteristic of gastro-intestinal anthrax) was probably
actually regional body edema caused by cutaneous lesions concurrent
with the gastro-intestinal infections. What is not generally
sufficiently acknowledged in human medical texts is the high
correlation in pastoralist societies like the Mursi between
consumption of infected meat and skin contact with it during prior
handling/carrying of that meat. This makes it more likely that
cutaneous anthrax and gastro-intestinal anthrax will be seen in the
same people.
We explained the epidemiology of anthrax to elders in Maiholi and
Doli and especially how opening an infected carcass leads to
formation of highly resistant anthrax spores which would contaminate
their Mursi grazing environment for 50 years or more. Advice was
given regarding the crucial need for prompt and thorough incineration
of all livestock and wildlife carcasses suspected of infection with
anthrax. Of course we emphasised that no one should attempt to use
the meat or hides of such animals. We hope to prepare some leaflets
which will help to explain these things clearly to Mursi throughout
Mursiland.

ORDER OF EVENTS
First week of November 2002 ("one month ago" - from 29 Nov 2002). Cattle die.
9-12 Nov 2002 - 4 died who ate meat
16 Nov 2002 - first news of a problem from a Mursi travelling from Shiginger.
18 Nov 2002 - second lot of messengers - from Doli.
25 Nov 2002 - third message received - from a man travelling from Bongos.
27 Nov 2002 - medicines and protective gear arrived from Addis Ababa by plane.
28 Nov 2002 - 5.00 am set off from Mako to Moizo where the vehicle
was left and then 15 km to Ngawunya on foot track via Chahuri and
Chawanya. At these places we questioned Mursi people about current
sickness in their areas. Although there were some sick people, there
were no anthrax cases.
29 Nov 2002 - Left Ngawunya at 4 am to walk 25 km to Maiholi and
spent rest of morning there interviewing people. The afternoon was
spent interviewing people at Doli and an anthrax survivor at
Bulukurugirong.
30 Nov 2002 - Left Nyamaniluru waterhole at 5 am to return to Moizo.
People dying of probable anthrax:
1: Shiginger: Ate meat morning after cow died; severe abdominal pain,
especially upper abdomen.
2: Shiginger: Butchered steer, did not eat meat, developed lesions on
arms and hands.
3: Shiginger: Butchered and ate cow.
4: Shiginger: Drank blood of sick steer.
5: Nyawure: Ate Lesser Kudu meat; reported to have had lesions.
6: ?Shiginger: Ate cow meat; developed lesions.
Recovered probable cases, all in Shiginger:
a: 4 adults developed skin lesions after carrying meat; lesions were
on the shoulder, back, head, face.
b: Male bitten by ant in gluteal region and area swelled up.
c: Adult female with fist-sized lesion on her side.
d: Shoulder and jaw swollen after eating cow meat.
e. Juvenile developed abdominal pain 5 days after eating cow meat,
limited vomiting on 8th day, no diarrhea.
Livestock Situation:
Shiginger: At least 10 cattle died one month ago; rest taken to
Kiwoi/Wulya. Goats affected with contagious caprine pleuropneumonia.
Other areas (Doli, Maiholi, Kiwoi, Wulya, Dowono): No problems except
for CCPP in Kiwoi.
Geddes Addendum:
"I found another informant last night who was from Shiginger and who
was visiting up this way for a very short time; 3 of his observations
I found interesting and helpful:
1. The man who cut up one of the beasts and subsequently died
experienced intense itching of his hands before the lesions
developed. He apparently did not eat affected meat, contrary to
previous information.
2. The male who died after drinking bacteraemic bovine blood that
morning ingested a fairly powerful indigenous anti-parasitic
preparation (apparently seeds of _Embelia schimperi_). In fact, he
had vomited prior to drinking the blood. When he died that night his
family and friends put it down to the effects of the medicines rather
than to the drinking of the blood. This is why they still ate the
steer that died with him. Maybe the medicine caused gastric
esophageal mucosal erosions sufficient to provide a rapid entry site
for the bacilli. Also, because he had vomited immediately prior to
ingesting the blood, the gastric juices that normally would have
quickly destroyed the vegetative cells may well have been depleted.
3. At least one cow and one steer that he saw (and he thinks there
where probably more) were affected by a less acute form of the
disease that caused marked swelling in the submandibular pharyngeal
and ventral neck areas with increased salivation and respiratory
stertor.
[_Embelia schimperi_ ("Ooloofwa") has edible part(s) and has
variable action with limited preparation and palatability. Fruits and
leaves are edible. Fruits are consumed as a medicine against
tapeworms and other intestinal parasites. The leaves are reported to
be edible and are used as food in eastern Africa. Fruits are
collected and consumed during food shortage periods, not as a
curative measure against any disease. It has been a well-documented
anthelmintic and is one of many local plants used to combat malaria.
Crushed seeds of Ooloofwa are taken in black tea; milk and butter are
added to children's tea [Bogh HO et al., 1996, Anthelmintic usage of
extracts of _Embelia schimperi_ from Tanzania. Journal of
Ethnopharmacology, 50, 35-42].
The toxicity of this plant seems almost nonexistent, and even
wildlife have been reported to consume it, with anthelmintic effects,
but almost no mammalian toxicity. The herbal remedy does not have
toxic signs that could be
confused with the clinical signs of anthrax. I am inclined to
believe this nausea and vomiting had nothing to do with the anthrax.
- Mod.TG]
[Clearly the human and livestock morbidity and mortality was due to
anthrax. We are most grateful to Jonathan (and Leith) for sharing
this information on his investigation in Mursiland. It is comforting
to see that the ethos of the old veterinary services continues, and
is alive and well in SIM and Ethiopia; I only wish I were younger.
Anyone investigating a similar event should remember that anthrax
spores are very robust and can be readily recovered from soil samples
taken where a suspect animal had been butchered or eaten by
scavengers. The bloody soil is fairly obvious for a couple of weeks,
but spores will live much longer even when overt evidence of blood is
gone. A couple of tablespoons of soil in a plastic bag is sufficient,
especially when carrying kit. Why the young man died after drinking
the blood I must leave to my physician colleagues, though I suspect
that Jonathan may well be correct. - Mod.MHJ]
