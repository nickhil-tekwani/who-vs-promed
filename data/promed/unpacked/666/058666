Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) is currently investigating
a cluster of hepatitis A cases in the Auckland region. 29 cases have been
notified in the period 15 Jan 2006 to 7 Apr 2006 inclusive. Overseas
travel, or close contact with someone who has recently returned from
overseas travel, has been identified as a common factor among 27 of these
cases. A disproportionate number of cases have a history of travel to Tonga
(13 cases) and Samoa (9 cases) within their incubation periods.
Due to the link with travel and the high rate of secondary cases, ARPHS are
initiating the following actions. Information regarding hepatitis A
symptoms and prevention measures are being circulated to the Tongan
community in Auckland through churches, primary healthcare organisations
and on flights to Tonga. Similar information will be advertised on Pacific
radio stations operating in the Auckland region. In addition, the New
Zealand Ministry of Health has alerted Tongan and Samoan health authorities
of the increase in cases.

The New Zealand Ministry of Health has been advised of cases of hepatitis A
in travellers returning from Samoa and Tonga. Cases have not been
identified in either of those countries, but a media statement has been
issued as the school holidays, in both New Zealand and Australia, approach
and we expect that there will be increased travel to the Pacific region.

The absence of reports of cases of hepatitis A among inhabitants of Samoa
and Tonga suggests that hepatitis A virus infection is endemic in both
islands and that the local inhabitants exhibit a high level of immunity to
reinfection. Although hepatitis A is a relatively benign and non-persistent
form of hepatitis, a good vaccine is available and travellers to these
islands from elsewhere should ensure that they have been vaccinated prior
to travel. - Mod.CP]
