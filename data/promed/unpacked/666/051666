A review of lab safety procedures is underway at the Army's biological
weapons defense center at Fort Detrick, MD., after a scientist contracted a
rare and potentially deadly disease, officials said yesterday.
The worker, a civilian microbiologist for the U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases, has been diagnosed with glanders, a
pathogen that defense officials fear could be used as an agent in
biological weapons. The Army has examined other employees who worked with
the infectious disease in a high-security laboratory at the Frederick
installation, as well as the worker's family members, and says there is no
threat to the general population.
"All the people he worked with in the lab have been evaluated, and nobody's
sick," said Charles Dacey, a Fort Detrick spokesman. "It doesn't appear to
have spread to anyone else."
"We don't feel there is any risk of additional transmission, which is a big
load off our minds," said Jeff Roche, a physician who is acting state
epidemiologist for the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
"This is a disease that has not been seen in Maryland for 50 years or
more."
The 33-year-old scientist, whose name is not being released by officials,
was hospitalized May 2 at Frederick Memorial Hospital after complaining of
fever, malaise and weight loss. He was transferred to Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore and was diagnosed with glanders on May 9. The
disease, associated with horses, is usually fatal to humans if left
untreated.
"He is getting better and should be going home soon," Roche said. "He looks
like he's been through a tough fight." The scientist has been working to
develop a vaccine and treatment for glanders and had been working with the
glanders organism for more than a year. He and 18 other researchers who
have worked with the organism operated under "biosafety Level 3"
procedures, which involve a tightly sealed laboratory with elaborate
filtration systems and negative air flow, in which the air pressure inside
the lab is lower than outside to prevent air inside from escaping.
The worker first became ill in March and went to his personal physician,
who, along with other doctors, was unable to diagnose the disease. He was
treated for an undiagnosed illness but continued working for a month and a
half with worsening symptoms.
The researcher did not report his condition to supervisors. "That in itself
is an unusual occurrence, and we need to learn more about it," said Col.
Gerald Parker, commander of the institute.
Employees who work in biocontainment suites are required to report fevers
with temperatures higher than 100.5 degrees, and the worker's temperature
was reported to be 103 in March, according to Frederick officials. "He was
sick, but didn't connect it with his work," Dacey said.
The glanders diagnosis "set off some alarm bells," Roche said.
The Army, assisted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta and state and Frederick County health agencies, is conducting both
safety and epidemiological investigations of the incident. Among the
possibilities being examined is whether the worker was exposed by a
puncture to the skin, inhalation or accidental inoculation. Investigators
have spoken to the employee in an attempt to learn how he might have been
infected. "He couldn't recall any breach," Dacey said. "He didn't stick
himself; he didn't spill anything."
Soviet scientists attempted to develop glanders into a biological weapon
during the Cold War.
During World War II, six workers at Fort Detrick were infected with
glanders, but they recovered after treatment. Fort Detrick officials said
incidents in which workers have been sickened by exposure to biological
agents have greatly decreased in recent years.
Since 1987, three workers have fallen ill after exposure to infectious
agents. All three recovered, and there have been no illnesses reported
since 1990.
