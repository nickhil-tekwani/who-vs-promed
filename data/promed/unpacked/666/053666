Over the past weekend [20-21 Sep 2014] in Kirov Oblast [region] there
was a mass poisoning of 99 people, of which 24 were minors, with a
smoking mix known as "Spice". One fatal case -- a 24-year-old male --
is confirmed, and 42 patients were hospitalized in medical facilities
of Kirov; 2 of them are in serious condition.

Traffickers distributed to consumers a new kind of psychoactive
substance under the name of "Spice". This substance is not included in
the list of banned products, but possesses the strongest narcotic
effect.

In Surgut more than 60 people were poisoned with a new kind of
synthetic drug. According to various sources between 10 and 20 people
with acute poisoning from the synthetic drug were admitted to medical
facilities of Surgut in the past 24 hours [24-25 Sep 2014].

There is no information on the exact number of cases, but with the
scant data, it is expected to exceed 60-70 people. To date, 11 people
were hospitalized with acute poisoning with the drug known as "Spice",
some of them are in serious condition, and one patient is in a coma.
Of those admitted, 3 are teenagers, with the majority of those
admitted being men between the ages of 20-40 years.

It is difficult to determine the exact number of poisoned because this
synthetic substance is not detected in the blood. The drug is a
synthetic psychostimulant contained in the "Spice" smoking mix. This
is a new form the drug that is highly concentrated, and it is not
listed as a forbidden medication.

Marijuana contains THC or tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive
component of the cannabis plant. However, the variety of synthetic
marijuanas contain other ingredients and go by a variety of names.
Among the names are K2, Spice, Mexxy, Black Mamba, fake weed, Yucatan
Fire, Skunk, Moon Rocks, and others.

Some of these synthetic compounds are promoted as herbal products,
with label claims that they contain "natural" psychoactive materials
taken from a variety of plants. Spice products (and the others as
well) may contain some dried plant material (not necessarily natural
cannabis), but chemical analyses show that their active ingredients
are synthetic (or designer) cannabinoid compounds. However, tests have
shown that it is not a single product. For example, Black Mamba
contains synthetic cannabinoid AM-2001 and oleamide and oleic acid.

The synthetic cannabinoids are not THC, but the body reacts to them as
if it were reacting to the cannabinoids in cannabis. However, the
synthetic variety can cause long-term problems, including long-term
psychotic disorders.

The variety of synthetic cannabinoids is large and apparently
constantly shifting to avoid detection and regulation by law
enforcement agencies. Consequently, it also makes it much harder on
physicians to stabilize and treat an individual who has had an
overdose, or even a reaction to a synthetic hallucinogen.

The UK and the US have regulated a number of these substances,
including cannabicyclohexanol, JWH-018, JWH-073, or HU-210. These
substances are illegal to possess or use and are considered banned
substances with jail terms of varying lengths, depending upon which
country's laws are examined. Further it appears that similar laws are
taking shape in Russia.

These synthetic products produce a longer lasting response,
potentially in some people unexpected psychotic episodes for the
remainder of their life, and apparently can "hook" people within
seconds, despite near death experiences.

Some states in the US have legalized the use of natural cannabis
products. Therefore, in an effort to extend the natural product, and
produce a desirable and longer lasting "high," the synthetic product
may be added to the natural product and unsuspecting customers may
suffer untoward effects and even death. - Mod.TG

A new outbreak of poisoning with the Spice smoking mix acquired
through the Internet was registered in Yugra, also in Khanty-Mansi
Autonomous Okrug).

Earlier, a similar situation was reported in the Kirov region where
more than 150 people were poisoned with the same smoking mix, and 4 of
them died. - Mod.NP

An update (29 Sep 2014) of the situation in Surgut mentions 7
fatalities (http://sitv.ru/arhiv/news/social/72310/) - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]
