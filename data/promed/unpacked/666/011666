[2] Egypt 2009 update
Date: Wed 2 Sep 2009

Update No 61, 31 Aug 2009 [edited]

Egypt, which reported its 1st H5N1 HPAI outbreak in February 2006, is
considered endemic, with regular reporting of outbreaks in almost all
of the 29 governorates. The Egyptian veterinary authorities reported
17 H5 HPAI outbreaks in poultry (chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese)
from 9 governorates: Behaira (3), Dakahlia (4), Dumyat (1), Gharbia
(1), Qalubia (4), Sharkia (1), Luxor (1), Suez (1) and Minufiyah (1).
12 outbreaks were reported in backyard poultry and 5 on farms. At
least 2 of the outbreaks occurred in vaccinated birds. The
participatory disease surveillance (PDS) teams detected 2 confirmed
out of 6 suspected HPAI outbreaks in Dakahlia, and one confirmed out
of 2 suspected outbreaks in Behaira. Surveillance activities are being
undertaken targeting both poultry and migratory wild birds around
select important bird areas (IBAs) during winter. Poultry farms are
required to test their birds and receive certification (H5 infection
negative status) prior to any planned t!
ransportation. During June 2009, 2749 samples were collected for this
purpose, and one tested positive in Qalyoubia Governorate. Compliance
with certification for poultry transportation is sub-optimal as only
registered farms seek such services. In terms of surveillance on
commercial farms during June 2009, active surveillance detected H5
HPAI infections on 2 farms in Qalyoubia Governorate (out of 13 farms
in 4 governorates), and passive surveillance detected infection on one
farm in Qalyoubia Governorate (out of 3 farms in 2 governorates). In
terms of surveillance in the backyard/household poultry sector, 8
households were confirmed positive in 5 governorates through active
surveillance (out of 91 samples from 13 governorates), and 4 samples
in 4 governorates were found positive through passive surveillance
(out of 11 samples from 6 governorates). 22 samples were also
collected at road check points, and one tested positive for HPAI. The
current government policy is to vaccinate poultry in
backyard/household settings twice a year and to allow
vaccines of their choice. Although there are no comprehensive
official vaccination data, it is assumed that vaccines are widely used
in the commercial poultry sectors. All AI vaccines used in Egypt are
imported. There are at least 21 imported vaccines, all inactivated and
mostly H5N1 Re-1 Chinese vaccine for household poultry and H5N2
vaccine for commercial farms.

During the reporting period (June 2009), the Egyptian health
authorities confirmed 3 human H5N1 AI cases in 3 different
governorates: a 17-month-old boy from Dumyat, a 4-year-old girl from
Dakahlia, and a 1.5-year-old boy from Kafr el-Sheikh. All these cases
had histories of close contact with dead and/or sick poultry. As
indicated above, all of the human cases were in children under 5 years
of age. In June 2009, the total number of HPAI H5N1 human infections
in Egypt reached 81, of which 27 of them were fatal cases. [As of 1
Sep 2009, the Egyptian data were: 85 confirmed cases, of which 27 have
been fatal. - Mod.AS].

[3] China 2009 update
Date: Wed 2 Sep 2009
Source: FAOAIDEnews Animal Influenza Disease Emergency Situation
Update No 61, 31 Aug 2009 [edited]


In China, since 2004, over 100 H5N1 HPAI outbreaks have been reported
in poultry and wild birds in 23 provinces, and a total of over 35
million poultry have been culled to control the spread of the disease.
No outbreaks were reported in June 2009. During the winter 2008-2009,
surveillance activities found 45 H5N1 HPAI positive samples of
chickens, ducks and geese at markets in the provinces of Fujian,
Chongqing, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Shandong and
Sichuan. Vaccination has been an important component to control the
infection since 2004. On mainland China, vaccination coverage
officially reported is still very high in all provinces. Mean
vaccination coverage through September 2008 is reported to be higher
for most provinces than for the same period in 2007. Additionally, all
but one province, Xinjiang, reported 80 percent vaccination coverage
or higher. Some of the current challenges are that
1) the current commercially used H5N1 inactivated vaccines do not
allow for serological distinction between vaccination and field
infection;
2) it is difficult to access poultry raised on backyard and
small-scale farms; 3) vaccination coverage in domestic waterfowl is
relatively low;
4) layer and breeder ducks in particular, since they do not display
clinical signs, are often only vaccinated when they are young, but no
booster vaccination is administered on most farms; and
5) waterfowl raised for meat consumption are usually not vaccinated
because of the age at the time of marketing (4-6 weeks).

[4] Indonesia 2009 update
Date: Wed 2 Sep 2009
Source: FAOAIDEnews Animal Influenza Disease Emergency Situation
Update No 61, 31 Aug 2009 [edited]


Indonesia continues to report a high number of H5N1 HPAI outbreaks in
poultry, as it has for the past 3 years. HPAI is endemic on Java,
Sumatra, Sulawesi and probably Bali islands, with sporadic outbreaks
reported elsewhere. Village prevalence varies widely. Only 2 of its 33
provinces have not reported the occurrence of H5N1 HPAI. The high
number of reported outbreaks each month is partially explained by the
implementation of the participatory disease surveillance and response
(PDSR) [see footnote*] programme that targets village-type poultry
production systems (mainly backyard) and reports evidence of virus
circulation in the village environment. The programme is financially
supported by FAO with USAID and AusAID, and is operating in 331/448
(74 percent) districts through 31 Local Disease Control Centres
(LDCCs) in 27 out of 33 provinces in Java, Sumatra, Bali, Sulawesi and
Kalimantan, including all known endemically infected areas. Larger and
less densely-populated provinces!
report HPAI outbreaks less often than more densely populated
provinces. During June [2009], PDSR officers visited 2112 villages, of
which 193 (7.1 percent) were infected (187 were newly found, while the
remaining 6 carried over the infection status from the previous
month). This was lower than the May 2009 infection rate of 9.1
percent. During the previous 6 months, PDSR officers visited 10 667
villages (16.5 percent) in the 331 Districts under PDSR surveillance.
Since May 2008, they have visited about 34 percent of villages under
coverage of the program. An average of 14.3 percent of the villages
visited during the previous 3 months were classified as infected at
the time of visit. Bali continued to have infected villages. Cases
over the last 6 months were concentrated in provinces on Java and
Sulawesi islands other than Gorontalo and North Sulawesi Provinces.

* PDSR case definition in Indonesia: When poultry mortality events are
encountered in which more than one bird died suddenly, with or without
clinical signs, Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR)
teams carry out an influenza type A rapid test. A mortality event
consistent with clinical HPAI and a positive rapid test in affected
poultry is considered a confirmed detection of HPAI in areas where
HPAI has previously been confirmed by laboratory testing.

[The FAOAIDEnews issue 61 of 31 Aug 2009 (13 pages) includes
additional information, such as a comprehensive report on the Central
Asia Regional Network for the Prevention and Control of Avian
Influenza, information on other infected countries, maps and tables.
It is expected to become available soon on FAO's website at
