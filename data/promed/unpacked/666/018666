According to the press service of the Investigation Department of the [Investigative Committee of Russia] in the Krasnoyarsk Territory, a criminal investigation under article "The production, transportation, storage, or sale of products not meeting the requirements of security" has been initiated after the confirmation of 19 cases of trichinellosis of which one woman died.

According to investigators, between 1 and 16 Oct 2012, the infectious [disease]department of the Norilsk hospital admitted 19 people with a diagnosis of "trichinellosis"; 5 cases were minors, and a 39-year-old woman died.

According to preliminary data, all admitted to the medical institution had eaten meat bought at a stall in the local market.

Representatives of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] withdrew the pork meat from the market and sent it for analysis. The results revealed violations of sanitary and epidemiological rules and regulations in the stall, which sells meat products.

[Local outbreaks of trichinellosis are common in Russia, and ProMED-mail has reported several previously (see below). The sources are either meat from carnivores like bear, or pork, which has been sold illegally without proper veterinary control. - Mod.EP
