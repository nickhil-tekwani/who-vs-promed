8 new Ebola cases confirmed
---------------------------
Health officials in Uganda's Kagandi Hospital have so far confirmed 8 new cases of Ebola. Statistics released by Health officials on Friday [3 Aug 20212] indicate that the number of people currently "actively being followed up" has increased from 232 to 253 in the recent 24 hours. Speaking on the matter, the chairman of the Ebola National Task Force, Mr. Anthony Mbonye said, "Of the 46 samples collected since the outbreak began, by 2 Aug 2012, 8 of them were confirmed positive and all are from Kibaale."

Uganda's Health Minister, Dr. Christine Ondoa revealed that out of the 312 civilians who were earlier confirmed to have been in contact with the sick and the dead, 253 of them were being closely monitored in connection with the transmission of the deadly virus.

Meanwhile, the country's World Health Organisation [representative], Dr. Joakin Saweka said that the situation is being closely monitored and there's no need for alarm in issuing any travel advisories against visiting Uganda. He assured the public that the situation was under control with enough structures put in place by the Ugandan government. The assurance came after continued international media attention which seemed to portray Uganda as a country in dire need of assistance, terming the situation as "deadly".

Uganda's Tourism Minister Ephraim Kamutu backed the remarks, questioning, "If it were deadly you would not be here. There are 312 contacts being followed in a population of over 34 million people, is that enough to say that the country is deadly?"

Generally, a national task force in Uganda has been formed in conjunction with an inter-ministerial committee established to strengthen and coordinate resources, management and response to the Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak. A national task force and an inter-ministerial committee have been established to better coordinate resources, response and management of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak.
