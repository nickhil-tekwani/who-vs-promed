A 23-year-old man diagnosed with anthrax checked into the hospital in
Karatau city of Kazakhstan's Dzhambul region. He is a resident of
Kaskabulak village. The disease was caused by the consumption of infected
beef, Tass learned from the Kazakhstan Emergencies Agency on Tuesday.
The diagnosis has been confirmed by laboratory analyses. The patient is now
undergoing intensive therapy and is in a satisfactory state.
