Other Possible Zoonotic Sources of LCMV
-----------------------------------------------
[Regarding the ProMED-mail post entitled "Human lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus: risk factors 20050804.2273], other less well
known but possible zoonotic sources of human lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) are marmosets and tamarins (family:
Callitrichidae), which are commonly exhibited in zoos and
occasionally kept as pets. LCMV primarily targets the liver in these
small South American monkeys, producing an acute fatal viral
hepatitis with jaundice and milder lymphocytic meningitis.
Callitrichid hepatitis (CH) broke out in zoos in the US in the 1980s
and early 1990s and was associated mostly with the feeding of newborn
mice as a dietary supplement. Wild mice were also implicated in some
of the documented cases. Seroconversion to LCMV antibodies occurred
in 2 individuals involved in some of the episodes (one of whom was an
attending veterinarian) but with no history of clinical disease. The
incidence declined significantly with recommended management
practices of not feeding mice and improving rodent control in the zoo
settings. Similar occurrences of CH have been reported in Germany.

[ProMED-mail thanks Richard Montali for adding this information. In
fact, LCMV has been widely used in laboratories by virologists and
immunologists and has played an important part in unraveling the
complexities of viral immunology and immmunopathology. Doherty and
Zinkernagel, in their Nobel prize-winning work, used an LCMV-mouse
model to demonstrate the important concept of MHC class I restriction
in cytotoxic T cell recognition. Outbreaks of human infection have
been recorded in laboratories, and, as a consequence, a
laboratory-adapted strain with reduced hazard for humans is commonly
used in laboratories now. - Mod.CP]
