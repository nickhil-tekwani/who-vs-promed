The frozen pizza brand Buitoni (Nestlé) announced on Friday [18 Mar 2022] the immediate recall of the entire Fraîch'up range, made up of 16 kinds, due to the presence of _Escherichia coli_ bacteria in the dough of a product. The entire French territory is affected by the withdrawal.

The brand asks consumers who bought Fraîch'Up frozen pizzas before 18 Mar 2022 not to eat them and to throw away the products. The press release does not specify the volumes or the countries concerned.

The French public health agency announced on 12 Mar [2022] that the resurgence of cases of serious contamination with the _E. coli_ bacterium had caused the death of 2 children in France since the beginning of 2022. The health authorities added that within the framework of the investigations currently carried out on cases of serious hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) reported since 1 Jan [2022] in France, "the analyzes (epidemiological, microbiological, and traceability) carried out suggest, at this stage, a link possible with the consumption of frozen pizzas from the Fraîch'Up range of the Buitoni brand."

"Investigations are continuing to determine the origin of the infection, including for other products, as well as epidemiological investigations, in order to establish potential links with all the cases detected in the territory since the beginning of January 2022," according to the joint press release from the Directorate General for Health (DGS), Public Health France, and the Directorate General for Competition, Consumer Affairs and Fraud Prevention (DGCCRF).

As of 17 Mar 2022, 27 cases of HUS or serious infection, linked to _E. coli_ bacteria with similar characteristics, had been identified, "and 31 additional cases are under investigation," according to the authorities. "The sick children, aged 1 to 18 years with a median age of 5.5 years, presented symptoms between 10 Jan 2022 and 10 Mar 2022. Two children died," he recalled.

"These 58 cases occurred in 12 regions of metropolitan France: Hauts-de-France (13 cases), New Aquitaine (9 cases), Pays de la Loire (9 cases), Brittany (6 cases), Ile-de-France (6 cases), Grand Est (5 cases), Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (3 cases), Bourgogne Franche-Comté (2 cases), Center Val-de-Loire (2 cases) Normandy (1 case), Occitanie (1 case), and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (1 case)," details the press release.

"We have been warned that an uneaten pizza showed a trace of _Escherichia coli_ beyond the limit of regulatory standards," said Pierre-Alexandre Teulié. "One of the characteristics of frozen pizzas is that _Escherichia coli_ disappear with heat; a pizza placed in the oven no longer presents any danger if it is consumed," according to the general manager in charge of communication.

Consumers can take a photo of the packaging with the references to be reimbursed by contacting consumer services, the brand adds, apologizing to consumers. "Our manufacturing procedures, our quality controls and compliance with storage, preparation, and cooking instructions, guarantee the hygiene and food safety of our pizzas," specifies Buitoni in its press release.

[Flour is an uncommon but reported vehicle for the transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ of a variety of serotypes. The serotype is not specifically mentioned here. Since dough made from flour is generally eaten fully cooked, most episodes seemed to have been linked to ingestion of uncooked or undercooked dough. It is possible that kitchen contamination with the EHEC occurred before the cooking of the frozen pizza. - Mod.LL
