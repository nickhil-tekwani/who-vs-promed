A leading conservationist who was left in critical condition with a viral brain infection after a mosquito bite has been flown back to the UK. Highly-respected conservationist Sophie Williams, who lectures at Bangor University [Gwynedd County, North Wales], was left in a coma after she was infected with Japanese encephalitis while working in China in July [2015]. The 31-year-old, of Yorkshire [England], was on a research trip in Asia when she contracted the virus, which is spread through mosquito bites, and was treated in a Bangkok [Thailand] hospital before flying back home this weekend [1-2 Aug 2015].

A spokesman for Bangor University said: "Dr Sophie Williams, a lecturer in Conservation Science at Bangor University fell ill during a visit to China. Sophie, a highly-respected and well liked conservation expert, was working on the joint project between Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanic Garden [Mengla County, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan province, China] and Bangor University's Treborth Botanic Garden when she was taken ill. "After initial assessment and treatment, she was transferred to another hospital in Bangkok and then flown back to the UK over the weekend [1-2 Aug 2015]." Dr Williams' father Mike, owner of Castlegate News in Yorkshire, said family and friends were facing a nervous wait...

Japanese encephalitis is common in rural areas of South East Asia and the Pacific islands and the Far East, but is rare in travellers. There is no cure for the disease so treatment is focused on relieving clinical symptoms and supporting the patient to overcome the infection. The virus is found in pigs and birds, and is passed to mosquitoes that bite the infected animals and cannot be spread from person to person. The Bangor University spokesperson added: "The staff of Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanic Garden as well as the health-care staff at the hospitals in Xishuangbanna and Bangkok have provided excellent care and support for Sophie and her family. In addition, the staff of the British Embassy and the insurance company have provided invaluable assistance. "We wish Sophie a rapid recovery."

[Since this is the travel season, those going to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) endemic areas should be aware of the potential for infection. The geographic areas where JEV is endemic are shown on the WHO map at http://gamapserver.who.int/mapLibrary/Files/Maps/Global_JE_ITHRiskMap.png.

The WHO states (http://www.who.int/ith/ITH_chapter_6.pdf), "The risk of Japanese encephalitis is very low for most travellers to Asia, particularly for short-term visitors to urban areas. However, the risk varies according to season, destination, duration of travel, and activities. Vaccination is recommended for travellers with extensive outdoor exposure (camping, hiking, working, etc.) during the transmission season, particularly in endemic countries or areas where flooding irrigation is practised. In areas at risk, Japanese encephalitis is primarily a disease of children, but it can occur in travellers of any age. Prevention is by avoidance of mosquito bites and by vaccination.

"The inactivated mouse brain-derived (IMB) vaccine is now commonly replaced by cell culture-based vaccines. A live attenuated vaccine based on the SA 14-14-2 strain of the JE virus is widely used in China and in an increasing number of countries within the Asian region, including India, the Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. A Vero cell-derived, inactivated and alum-adjuvanted JE vaccine based on the SA 14-14-2 strain was approved in 2009 in North America, Australia, and various European countries. The primary 2 doses are administered 4 weeks apart. A booster dose is recommended 1-2 years after the primary immunization. This vaccine has been given concomitantly with hepatitis A vaccine without significant interference with the safety and immunogenicity of either vaccine. The vaccine is licensed for use in individuals 17 years of age and older in the United States, and 18 years and above in other countries. Paediatric and post-marketing safety studies are under way."

Individuals traveling to JEV endemic areas should consult a travel medicine clinic or knowledgeable health provider to assess their risk of infection and advisability of receiving the JEV vaccine prior to travel. Although the risk of infection with neurological complications is relatively small, should that occur, the consequences can be serious. For example, in 2009 the USA CDC reported 3 cases of JEV infection treated in the USA who acquired infection in Korea, the Philippines and Cambodia. Of these 3, 2 had neurologic deficits from their infections (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5827a1.htm). - Mod.TY

Although JE vaccination may not be indicated for visits to major cities in endemic countries, it should always be considered for rural areas. For visitors who decide to extend their travel to rural areas after arrival, it will be too late for vaccination on the spot to be any use.
