I have read the ProMED-mail post "Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (43)",
and I was hoping for an explanation of why Marburg virus is transmissible
via sexual contact for approximately 3 months after recovery?

Re: Role of Bats in Transmission of Marburg Virus
-------------------------------------------------
The bat is considered, probably correctly, as a possible host for Marburg
and Ebola viruses. Has anyone considered that it may not be a bat at all but
a mite who lives on a bat, and drops off in caves, trees, where they roost,
hence infecting the monkeys. I have never seen bats in African huts. I would
have thought the people and the smoke would not be conducive to them, but
they may fly in, and a mite crawls off and is left behind.
You may remember years ago that [there was] a case of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever in a young boy in a big cave near Entebbe, Kenya. Numerous tests were
carried out, but nothing was found, yet this boy said that he had touched
the walls of this cave, but that he had not been bitten or had contact with
a bat.

[It has been suspected that bats in caves have somehow been involved in
transmission of Ebola virus and Marburg virus in the Congo and Angola. I
understand that genetic evidence from bats was found supporting the
possibility that they might play a role in transmission, although no virus
was found in bats. Possibly humans can be infected through guano or
handling bats, though it should be remembered that in at least in some
countries in West and Central Africa, bats are eaten.
Bats have various ectoparasites such as mites (e.g. 64 spp. on bats in UK),
ticks, fleas, _Cimex_ spp. such as _C. adjunctus_ and _Leptocimex boueti_
(in other words bed-bugs, but not species that attack humans), and parasitic
and often wingless flies such as those belonging to the families Streblidae
and Nycteribiidae.
All these ectoparasites are very host-specific, indeed some mite species are
found on only one species of bat. If bats are handled when alive, there is
little chance of these parasites attaching to humans, but if the bat is
killed, then as its body temperature falls, it is just possible that the
ectoparasites might in desperation attach to humans.
I have been in thousands of village houses of all descriptions in West,
Central, Southern, and East Africa, but have never found bats in them. -

In ProMED-mail post "Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (43) 20050524.1432,"
Mod.JW commented that that the spread of Marburg virus to humans from
monkeys "has been proven for Ebola virus but not for Marburg virus."
Although not in the wild, the evidence is very clear that the source of
human infection for the original outbreak of Marburg virus in Marburg,
Germany and a few other European cities in 1967 was monkeys imported from
Uganda. Human infection occurred primarily in those harvesting organs for
use in vaccine production, a process certainly parallel to butchering for
consumption.

Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever in Angola - Fighting Fear and a Lethal Pathogen
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[The attention of the readership of ProMED-mail is drawn to a paper by
Nestor Ndayimirije, M.D., and Mary Kay Kindhauser, M.A. entitled "Marburg
Hemorrhagic Fever in Angola - fighting Fear and a Lethal Pathogen",
published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Volume 352, pages 2155 -
2157, 26 May 2005
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/352/21/2155?query=TOC>.
(Dr. Ndayimirije is an epidemiologist at the World Health Organization (WHO)
in Brazzaville, Congo, and Ms. Kindhauser is a science writer at WHO in
Geneva.) The entire text is reproduced below.]
On 21 Mar 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta confirmed the presence of Marburg virus in 9 of 12 patient samples
of tissue and blood sent for analysis by health authorities in Angola. The
samples came from a growing number of patients, almost all of them linked to
a single pediatric ward in the main hospital in Uige Province, who were
rapidly dying from an unknown disease with hemorrhagic manifestations. The
identity of the causative agent came as a surprise: Marburg hemorrhagic
fever is an exceedingly rare disease, and there had never been a case before
in Angola. Diagnostic confirmation set in motion a large-scale international
response that began the day after the CDC's finding. Both the features of
Marburg hemorrhagic fever and the conditions in Angola have made this
response an extreme test of the national and international capacity to hold
a dangerous emerging disease at bay.
Like the closely related Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marburg is a rare but
severe and highly fatal disease caused by a virus in the family
_Filoviridae_. The viruses that cause these 2 diseases are among the most
lethal pathogens known to infect humans. Both hide in some still-elusive
place in nature, surfacing from time to time to cause a few sporadic cases
and then disappearing again. Both diseases can flare into dramatic
outbreaks, usually associated with unsafe practices that amplify
transmission in a health care setting. The sudden onset, rapid deterioration
of patients' condition, dramatic hemorrhagic symptoms, and high mortality
rate invariably cause great anxiety in the affected populations. In the
current Marburg outbreak in Angola, fear, albeit understandable, has been
one of the greatest impediments to the control of the spread of disease.
With more than 270 cases to date and almost as many deaths, this outbreak is
the largest and deadliest outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever on record.
At present, the case fatality rate is 92 percent. It is also the 1st natural
outbreak of the disease to take place in an urban setting. The only other
large outbreak, which occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 1998
to 2000, caused 154 cases and 128 deaths in 2 sparsely populated villages in
a remote corner of the country.
In principle, the measures needed to contain the outbreak are few in number
and straightforward in nature: rapid detection of cases and isolation of
patients, tracing and care of contacts, infection control in hospitals, and
avoidance of funeral and burial practices that allow close contact with
bodies. The lack of public understanding of the disease, however, has
impeded effective implementation of these measures. Since almost no one has
survived this disease, communities associate the admission of patients to
the isolation ward with certain death and have preferred to provide care at
home, often hiding affected persons and then their dead bodies.
Apart from placing caregivers at great risk of infection, this resistance
has also hampered efforts to identify and monitor contacts. Mobile
surveillance and public-awareness teams were forced briefly to suspend
operations on 3 occasions when they were stoned or threatened by hostile
residents. The deaths of 16 doctors and nurses undermined the morale of
hospital staff members who were working in already-difficult conditions.
When we arrived in Uige, the most immediate needs were to clean and
disinfect hospital wards and the homes where patients had died, as well as
to collect and bury corpses. We soon realized that building trust and
securing community collaboration would play a critical role in bringing the
outbreak under control.
Conditions in Angola have created additional challenges in the effort to
contain the outbreak. Almost 3 decades of civil unrest have left the country
with a population that is severely weakened by economic hardship, a hospital
system in dire need of basic equipment and supplies, and inadequate
communication and transportation infrastructure. Municipalities in the
province have the crowding and poor sanitation common to urban settings, but
the poor infrastructure is that usually seen in rural areas. Travel by road
is often precarious, since many roads are still heavily mined, necessitating
air transport of staff and equipment and the use of helicopters to
investigate alerts in remote areas.
Nonetheless, the success of the initial containment effort has surpassed our
early expectations. Uige Province has remained the epicenter of the
outbreak, currently accounting for 95 percent of all cases. No chains of
transmission have been identified outside this province. Fears that the
virus would establish a foothold in densely populated Luanda and its
sprawling shantytowns have not been realized to date. Although the outbreak
has not yet been contained, the numbers of new cases and deaths that occur
daily have begun to decrease. The Uige municipality remains the hot spot of
ongoing transmission.
The need to isolate patients has not been fully accepted by the population;
on most days, the isolation ward has few, if any, patients. Home-based
treatments involving the use of unsafe syringes have become an important
route of transmission. Cases of Marburg disease have been confirmed in
traditional healers. Procedures for infection control at the provincial
hospital are not rigorously followed, and serious high-risk exposures on
open wards have created worrisome opportunities for nosocomial amplification
and a 2nd wave of cases. During the last week of April 2005, an additional 2
doctors were directly exposed while trying to save the lives of patients who
were later confirmed to be infected with the virus. Bodies are not always
promptly collected, and beds are not always disinfected after deaths.
Every outbreak presents a unique set of problems that have to be solved
innovatively and quickly, under emergency conditions. Each outbreak of
international concern does, however, leave the World Health Organization
(WHO) and its partners with accrued experience and more technical
innovations to draw on when the next event inevitably occurs. Virtual
networks and infrastructure, developed by the WHO during the past decade and
seriously tested during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS), made it possible to quickly assemble the necessary
expertise and laboratory support for the current outbreak. To date, more
than 70 international staff members, drawn mainly from institutions within
the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and rapid-response teams
maintained by the WHO's regional office in Brazzaville, Democratic Republic
of Congo, have participated in containment activities. Many of these
professionals are experienced in the control of viral hemor!
rhagic fevers in African settings and understand the importance of working
with communities as partners in controlling outbreaks.
Techniques for sensitizing local populations and gaining their trust and
cooperation, developed during responses to outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever, have been applied with measurable success in Angola. Portable field
laboratories were made available and operated in Uige by the Canadian
National Microbiology Laboratory and in Luanda by the CDC. A virtual network
of high-containment laboratories with personnel who are experienced in the
diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fevers has contributed essential support. The
CDC sequenced the virus early in the outbreak, compared it with viruses from
previous outbreaks, and put to rest questions about whether this outbreak
was caused by an unusually lethal strain.
Daily teleconferences with the WHO offices in Uige and Luanda have made it
possible to identify needs -- whether for disinfectants and personal
protective equipment or for vehicles, satellite telephones, and handheld
radio sets -- and meet them within a day or 2 . Surveillance has been
greatly facilitated by basic and communications infrastructure that was put
into place for the poliomyelitis-eradication initiative. The speed and
intensity of the international response, including rapid funding of
activities, underscore the heightened concern about emerging diseases and
illustrate the resources this concern can generate in an emergency
situation -- even when the threat of international spread and economic
disruption is far less than that posed by diseases such as SARS and pandemic
influenza or the prospect of a bioterrorist attack.
But outside help can never fully compensate for inadequate national
capacity, so another important goal is to transfer the skills and
responsibilities for responding to an outbreak to local professionals, and
training is under way with this result in mind. Past experience in many sub-
Saharan African countries, where the viral hemorrhagic fevers sporadically
resurface, suggests that the 1st cases in the next outbreak will almost
certainly occur in hospitals. Health care facilities will therefore place
doctors, nurses, and other patients at the greatest risk. As in Angola
today, frontline workers will not only be at great personal risk but will
also be facing patients for whom little, if anything, can be done -- either
to save their lives or to reassure and comfort their loved ones. This, too,
is part of the human side of these devastating, yet fortunately rare,
diseases.
