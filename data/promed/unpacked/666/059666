Wilmaria Olives is located alongside the Wilson River in the Hastings
Valley on the New South Wales Mid North Coast.

The table olives were very disappointing [due to] the amount of rain
during March [2011] as well as a devastating olive disease.

"All down the east coast of Australia and inland to a surprising
degree we had this anthracnose which is a fungus problem," a grower
says. "It hit with a vengeance, it was the worst year that I've ever
had and the worst year everybody's had that I've spoken to."

[The fungi _Colletotrichum acutatum_, _C. coccodes_ (previously
_Gloeosporium olivarum_) and _Glomerella cingulata_ (previously _C.
gloeosporioides_) have been reported to be associated with anthracnose
disease of olive. Symptoms may include flower blight leaf spots, pre-
and post-harvest fruit rot and spotting, twig dieback with bark
lesions, and loss of tree vigour. Asymptomatic infection of olive
flowers may occur from the early stage of flowering to fruit set.
Economic losses are caused by reduced fruit yield and reduction of oil
quality. Disease development is favoured by warm temperatures and high
humidity.

The fungi have a long saprophytic survival ability on dead twigs and
leaves. Spread occurs mainly with infected plant material, by
mechanical means (including insect activities) and water splash.
Disease management usually includes preventative fungicide treatments,
phytosanitation to reduce inoculum, and cultural measures to reduce
moisture in the orchard. Commercial olive cultivars show varying
levels of susceptibility to anthracnose.
