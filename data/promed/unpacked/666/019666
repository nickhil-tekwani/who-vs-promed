Central Australian residents are being warned against the potentially deadly mud disease melioidosis following heavy wet season rains in desert regions across the Northern Territory. Melioidosis is a potentially lethal bacteria typically found in soil and muddy water across the Top End. It is present in the soil all year round, however it comes to the surface after drenching rains commonly associated with the tropical wet season that begins in October.

"Most years we say it is a Top End disease because we think of the centre as desert with not too much rain," the NT Health Department's Vicki Krause said.

However, this season the potential risk has spread following heavy rains that flooded a Central Australian community over the Christmas break. "There is already been one case [of melioidosis] in the centre and we expect there to be more," Ms Krause said. "After these drenching rains and flooding, melioidosis is present even in Central Australia."

Ms Krause said the risk spread to the lower parts of the Territory about every 6 years and that people in the Barkly region should also be vigilant this wet season.

"This is a serious disease and there are deaths every year."

[Most of the reports of melioidosis from Australia originate in the Northern Territory; however, the disease is also endemic in Queensland, which is east of the Northern Territory and some cases are reported from Western Australia as well. The disease usually occurs during the rainy season and may be accentuated by extreme flooding from rain and also from tsunamis, as occurred in 2005 in Thailand. A few cases were diagnosed after survivors returned to their home country of Finland.

In a 2003 Australian report Cheng AC, Hanna JH, Norton R, et al; Melioidosis in northern Australia, 2001-02. Commun Dis Intell 2003;27: 272-277), related to _Burkholderia pseudomallei_ cases in 2001 and 2002, one case from acquired in Western Australia and all the others were from the northern (above the 20 degrees south latitude) areas of the Northern Territory (mostly centered around Darwin) and Queensland.

Central Australia, also known as the Alice Springs Region, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia) is one of the 5 regions in the Northern Territory of Australia. The term Central Australia is used to describe an area centred on Alice Springs. It is sometimes referred to as Centralia; likewise the people of the area are sometimes called Centralians. The region is located in southern part of the Northern Territory spanning from the west on the Western Australian border to the east on the Queensland border.
