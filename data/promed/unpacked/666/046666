Brazil has recorded 2 cases of monkeypox in babies. Bahia had a positive diagnosis in a 60-day-old child and, in São Paulo, the disease was confirmed in a 10-month-old baby.

The São Paulo Health Department said that the child, male, is clinically stable and has no signs of worsening, with a characteristic clinical picture for the disease, with fever and cutaneous lesions. The agency added that the symptoms started on 11 Aug 2022 and that the child is in isolation at home. The Basic Health Unit and the Health Surveillance Unit in the patient's region of residence are monitoring the case.

The Bahia Department of Health stated that it does not disclose information on patients' health.

The capital of São Paulo has 1880 confirmed cases of the disease, 23 of which are in children under 10 years of age. Another 689 are under investigation, according to the bulletin released on Tuesday (23 Aug 2022).

According to the Health Department, in the state of São Paulo there are 2528 confirmed cases, including 30 patients under 11 years of age.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Before April 2022, monkeypox virus infection in humans was seldom reported outside African regions where it is endemic. Currently, cases are occurring worldwide. Transmission, risk factors, clinical presentation, and outcomes of infection are poorly defined.

Methods
We formed an international collaborative group of clinicians who contributed to an international case series to describe the presentation, clinical course, and outcomes of polymerase-chain-reaction-confirmed monkeypox virus infections.

Results
We report 528 infections diagnosed between 27 Apr and 24 Jun 2022, at 43 sites in 16 countries. Overall, 98% of the persons with infection were gay or bisexual men, 75% were White, and 41% had human immunodeficiency virus infection; the median age was 38 years. Transmission was suspected to have occurred through sexual activity in 95% of the persons with infection. In this case series, 95% of the persons presented with a rash (with 64% having ≤10 lesions), 73% had anogenital lesions, and 41% had mucosal lesions (with 54 having a single genital lesion). Common systemic features preceding the rash included fever (62%), lethargy (41%), myalgia (31%), and headache (27%); lymphadenopathy was also common (reported in 56%). Concomitant sexually transmitted infections were reported in 109 of 377 persons (29%) who were tested. Among the 23 persons with a clear exposure history, the median incubation period was 7 days (range, 3 to 20). Monkeypox virus DNA was detected in 29 of the 32 persons in whom seminal fluid was analyzed. Antiviral treatment was given to 5% of the persons overall, and 70 (13%) were hospitalized; the reasons for hospitalization were pain management, mostly for severe anorectal pain (21 persons); soft-tissue superinfection (18); pharyngitis limiting oral intake (5); eye lesions (2); acute kidney injury (2); myocarditis (2); and infection-control purposes (13). No deaths were reported.

Conclusions
In this case series, monkeypox manifested with a variety of dermatologic and systemic clinical findings. The simultaneous identification of cases outside areas where monkeypox has traditionally been endemic highlights the need for rapid identification and diagnosis of cases to contain further community spread.

[5] Ocular lesions
Date: Wed 17 Aug 2022

ref: Mazzotta V, Mondi A, Carletti F, et al. Ocular involvement in monkeypox: description of an unusual presentation during the current outbreak. J Infect. 2022; S0163-4453(22)00474-1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- In the current multinational outbreak of MPX, ocular complications have been reported very rarely compared with what has been reported in previous outbreaks in endemic settings.

- This is one of the 1st cases described of monkeypox (MPX) with ocular involvement with an infective and replication competent MPXV isolated in culture.

- The time course of the ocular manifestations (ocular onset delayed with respect to the skin rash and concomitant systemic symptoms) is suggestive of a pathogenetic mechanism based on self-inoculation from skin lesions.

- Viral clearance and clinical recovery after treatment with intravenous cidofovir were slow.

[Letter to the Editor; abridged]
Here we reported a clinical case of ocular involvement in a MSM, in which MPXV-DNA was detected by real-time PCR both in eyelid and conjunctival swabs, and MPXV was also isolated in cell culture as replication-competent, infective virus. This case highlights some elements that may have implications for the transmission and pathogenesis of this unusual complication.

In May 2022, a 26-year-old Italian male attended the outpatients' department for the appearance of 2 papular lesions in the suprapubic area and he was diagnosed as infected by MPXV by real-time PCR performed on skin lesions. He reported protected sexual intercourse 5 days before the visit with a male partner who subsequently tested positive for MPXV.

He was admitted to our hospital 2 days after the 1st visit, for fever, general malaise, headache, painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, and multiple papular lesions in the right eyelid with progressive periorbital and conjunctival involvement. The ophthalmologist's evaluation ruled out visual impairment and corneal involvement, and, on suspicion of bacterial superinfection, topical steroid therapy was started along with intravenous antibiotic therapy.

Due to the clinical worsening (increased number of lesions in upper and lower eyelids and the eye fornix with periorbital oedema and conjunctival hyperaemia), swabs from periorbital lesions and conjunctiva were collected and tested for MPXV. Viral DNA was extracted by Qiamp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen), and 2 real time PCRs were used to assess the presence of MPXV DNA: Real-Star Orthopoxvirus PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics GmbH), which recognizes a region common to all orthopoxviruses without distinction of species, was used as screening PCR; the 2nd PCR (G2R_G assay) published by Li et al. targets the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor gene and was used as confirmatory PCR. The Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) platform was used to run both assays. We also measured the viral quantification cycle (Cq) in positive samples. Both eyelid and conjunctival samples were positive for MPXV DNA by both PCRs. Moreover, the conjunctival swab was successfully inoculated in Vero E6 cells, a clear cytopathic effect was observed 48 hours after the inoculum and MPXV replication was confirmed by real-time PCR on DNA purified from cell growth medium collected after 48, 72, and 96 hours.

The patient was treated with 2 doses of intravenous cidofovir (5 mg/kg weekly associated with oral probenecid and fluid support) and anti-inflammatory and vitamin A-based eye drops; steroid local therapy was stopped. Slow clinical improvement was observed with asynchronous evolution of the lesions and their total disappearance at approximately 2 months after onset (Fig. 1 -- available at the source URL above).

Our case confirms the possibility of ocular involvement during MPXV infection in a non-endemic setting. We detected MPXV-DNA by real time PCR and were able to isolate MPXV as a replication-competent virus from conjunctival swabs. Unlike previously described, in our patient systemic symptoms and ocular involvement were subsequent to the appearance of the 1st skin lesions by a few days. This time course suggests that eye localization might be related to self-inoculation, rather than conjunctival spread during the early viraemic phase of infection.

Although the passage of the virus into the conjunctival secretion from the plasma compartment has been hypothesized, previously described cases of ocular complications of MPX were mainly related to bacterial superinfection.

In contrast, we showed that both eyelid and conjunctival specimens were positive for MPXV DNA, and a replication-competent MPXV was isolated in culture from conjunctival swab, in absence of bacterial growth.

MPX in the current outbreak had usually mild to moderate and self-limited clinical presentation and observed cases generally did not require specific antiviral therapies. However, antivirals may be considered in severe disease, or complicated lesions localized in areas at high risk of sequelae.

Tecovirimat is currently the only drug approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of MPXV, but it is not yet readily available. Although only data in vitro and from mouse models are available on systemic antiviral therapy with cidofovir we used this drug due to the worsening clinical picture to avert the risk of sequelae on vision. Complete recovery and intraocular viral clearance occurred slowly, suggesting that the antiviral activity of cidofovir only partially contributed to clinical resolution. Finally, our case suggests a pathogenetic mechanism of ocular localization based on the spread from a local inoculum. Therefore, appropriate counselling on hygiene measures to reduce the risk of virus self-spreading should be also carried out.
