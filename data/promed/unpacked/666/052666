A 12th person died in Turkey over the weekend of a tick-borne viral
hemorrhagic fever, hospital officials said, adding that safety measures were
being taken and dismissing fears of a full-scale epidemic.
The victim, a woman in her 80s, died Saturday at an Ankara hospital where she
had been transported after being bitten by a tick in her native Karabuk
province on the Black Sea coast.
A series of deaths have occurred this year from Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic
fever, while 13 other people are being treated in Turkish hospitals with
scores more under observation.
Since it first appeared in Turkey in 2003, 44 people have died from the
disease, most of them in the central Anatolia provinces, with case fatality
around 5 percent.
Anxious Turks have been swarming hospitals in the areas concerned, while last
week 15 children were quarantined in the Istanbul area complaining of tick
bites. Schools in the capital Ankara have also cancelled visits to the zoo
and picnics in the open.
On Sunday Health Minister Recep Akdag sought to calm widespread public worry
about the outbreak but issued warnings to residents in areas with concentrated
livestock farms. "Those who take care of livestock must be particularly
vigilant," he said, according to the Anatolia news agency.
Crimean-Congo fever was first identified in 1944 on the Crimean peninsula in
what was then the Soviet Union. The Congo appellation was added in 1969 after
the discovery that the same disease had been found in central Africa in 1956.

[Quarantine of children bitten by ticks or closure of the zoo to school
children in an area where the CCHF virus has not been shown to be present does
not seem justified -- Ankara is a long way from the Black Sea, where the woman
was bitten. Even where the virus is present, people not in direct, physical
contact with animals infected with CCHF virus are not at risk of becoming
infected themselves. People become infected through the bite of infected
ticks or through direct exposure to bodily fluids of infected animals or
humans.- Mod.TMY/JW]
