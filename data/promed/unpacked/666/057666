[Wyoming] State livestock officials are investigating a 2nd confirmed
case of brucellosis in Park County and a possible new case in Sublette County.

Wyoming assistant state veterinarian Bob Meyer said Wednesday [1 Dec
2010] the new case in Park County involves a herd of 1400 bison. The
state is working with the owner to test the entire herd. 3
surrounding cattle herds also are being tested, even though the bison
are fenced in, Meyer said.

It's suspected that elk may have been the source of the disease in
the bison, he said.

"We want to make sure that any of the surrounding herds right around
there didn't get the same exposures to the elk because the elk can
jump over fences both ways," Meyer said.

The new case is not related to an earlier case discovered in late
October [2010] in a separate cattle herd in Park County, located in
northwest Wyoming. The state tested thousands of cattle in 12 herds
in the 1st case and found no additional infections.

However, preliminary tests indicate possible brucellosis in one cow
that was being put up for sale in Sublette County, which is in west
central Wyoming, Meyer said. More tests are being done to confirm the
initial findings and more will be known sometime next week [week of 6
Dec 2010], he said.

The herd in question numbers about 650 head and there are 4 or 5
other cattle herds nearby, Meyer said.

The disease can cause spontaneous abortions, infertility, and weight
loss in cattle, elk, bison, and other mammals. It persists in herds
of wild elk and bison around Yellowstone National Park and has
periodically passed to cattle in Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming.

Until recently, if the disease was found in multiple cattle herds it
meant costly restrictions on marketing of all Wyoming cattle to
prevent brucellosis from spreading to other states.

However, the US Department of Agriculture has eased its stance
recently on imposing statewide restrictions and has assured the state
that it will retain its status as being considered free of
brucellosis, Meyer said.

"As long as we're doing a good investigation to make sure that we
haven't got spread into any other herds -- testing neighboring herds,
testing in the area, and doing a good investigation -- they said your
status will stay intact, meaning we won't have a downgrade in status
from USDA," he said.

[Brucellosis in wildlife and in the area around the Greater
Yellowstone area is a challenge for the state disease regulators. It
has certainly kept them busy testing and tracing the movement of
animals into and out of suspect herds.

The signal from USDA regarding some flexibility in the rules,
especially around the Greater Yellowstone area is good news for
producers. - Mod.TG]
