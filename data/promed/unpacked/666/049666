A malaria outbreak has left over 130 people seeking treatment in Bomet County in the past 4 days, according to local health officials.

Bomet County Executive for Health Joseph Sitonik confirmed the outbreak at a press conference Thursday morning [20 Feb 2020]. He said the number of affected residents was rising by the day. "Public health officers have mounted a surveillance in the affected regions with a view to containing further spread of infections," Dr. Sitonik said.

In January [2020], 4 patients were treated, but in the recent past the number of patients has increased sharply.

A majority of the cases have been reported in Sotik. Some 60 patients have been treated at various hospitals in the sub-county, Dr. Sitonik said. "So far, 39 cases have been recorded at Longisa Hospital and 25 cases at Tenwek Hospital," he said.

[Bomet County is part of the former Rift Valley Province. It is located at an altitude of 1960 meters (6430 ft), which usually excludes malaria transmission because the temperature is too low. Thus, sustained transmission at this altitude probably signals an increasing temperature, which allows development of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria (we assume it is _P. falciparum_) in the local _Anopheles_ mosquito population. _P. falciparum_ requires a 24-hour temperature of not below 20 deg C (68 deg F) to develop in the mosquitoes. - Mod.EP
