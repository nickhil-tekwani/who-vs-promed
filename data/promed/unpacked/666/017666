African swine fever in Sardinia
--------------------------------
A case of African Swine Fever (ASF) has been officially recorded on a farm
in Sardinia, an Italian Mediterranean Island.
ASF is a viral disease of domestic and wild pigs. In view of the high
mortality involved and the disease's devastating effects upon the pig
industry, ASF is regarded by the World Animal Health Organization -- OIE --
as one of the most serious infectious animal diseases. The disease has
spread in most areas of the African continent, becoming a significant
obstacle to the development of the pig industry there.
ASF is present in parts of Sardinia where close contact between wild and
domestic pigs is prevalent. The uncontrolled spread of infection is also
attributed to the prevailing practice of private house slaughter, performed
without veterinary inspection.
The measures taken to control ASF are rather similar to those adopted for
the control of other swine diseases, such as Classical Swine Fever.

[African Swine Fever is endemic in Sardinia, with 11 outbreaks reported
during each of the years 2000 and 2001; 458 animals were destroyed during
2000 and 232 in 2001. Most outbreaks have been in the province of Nuoro, but
Cagliari has also been affected. Antibodies to the virus have been found in
the local wild boar population.
