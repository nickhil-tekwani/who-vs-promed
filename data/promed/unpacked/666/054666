[Prof. Hal Nash became interested in the possible links between infection &
chronic disease, partly through reading ProMED-mail. We commissioned him to
provide a summary of the current state of knowledge, which will be posted
in several parts, all with titles beginning:

Polycystic kidney disease
-------------------------------
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) occurs as an autosomal dominant or
autosomal recessive disease. The autosomal recessive form is quite rare
and frequently causes high mortality during the first month of life. In
PKD, fluid-filled cysts form within the kidneys encroaching upon the
kidney's ability to filter the blood. Numerous cysts are possible and
range in size from grains of sand to grapefruit.
The emergent infectious character of the disease was revealed in a 1984
study in which PKD[-prone mice survived long into adulthood when raised
under germ-free conditions, but their littermates exposed to the
environment developed cysts early and succumbed soon after. This obviously
suggested an environmental contributing factor in the triggering of the
disease. Additional studies showed that administration of
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also commonly referred to as gram negative
bacterial endotoxin, produced higher rates of cyst formation than commonly
seen when the genetic trait is left to act alone.
Current research has detected endotoxin in kidney cyst fluid in addition to
a constituent of fungal and yeast cell walls. Through immunologic assay,
the endotoxin was found to be reactive with several enterobacteriaceae and
has led to a recently proposed hypothesis of a "leaky gut component" in
PKD pathophysiology. Up to 80% of PKD patients demonstrate colon
pathophysiology. Analysis of the fungal component also implicated seeding
of renal tissue from the gut.

An adenovirus linked to obesity
--------------------------------------
Alterations in metabolic pathways manifest themselves in altered function,
regardless of what caused the alteration. Researchers have reported that
chickens notably low in serum cholesterol and triglycerides, after being
infected with human adenovirus-36, developed visceral obesity to a degree
that would not be expected.
Eighteen percent of the obese chickens, and zero percent of the lean,
showed neutralizing antibodies to adenovirus-36. Repeated results were
found in mice infected with human adenovirus AD-36P.
When screening human sera for an avian adenovirus it was found that the
body mass index was higher for those positive for the adenovirus than for
those who were negative.
Researchers are still in the early stages of linking at least a portion of
obesity cases to an infectious etiology. Questions still remain regarding
the mechanism by which the virus might disrupt metabolism and cause
increased adiposity.
