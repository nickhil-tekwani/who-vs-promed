TUBERCULOSIS (RESISTANT) SPREAD ON PLANE - AFRICA/EUROPE/USA

Greater Glasgow Health Board has been alerted to the fact that three Scots
were exposed to a case of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) during
a long-haul flight from Brussels to New York. The index case, whose journey
commenced in West Africa and who flew to New York via Brussels, was reported
to be strongly smear-positive and to have been coughing during the journey.
First line drug sensitivities have yet to be confirmed. The airline involved
advised all passengers on board both flights of their exposure via the
travel agents who had booked their tickets. In all there are eight UK
residents being followed up.
The three contacts from Scotland have been examined and two of them have
been found to be strongly tuberculin positive (Mantoux >= 20mm with
blistering). All three have normal chest X-rays. The tuberculin reactions
are considered to indicate recent exposure and the two (positives) are being
commenced on a six-month treatment regimen using three drugs.

[It seems there could have been many passengers -- and crew? -- infected on
the flights between W.Africa & Europe, and again between Europe and the
USA. Does anyone have any information on those?
We do not normally post items about TB, but this involves a drug-resistant
strain, which is relevant to disease emergence, and also the potential for
spread to several different countries. - Mod.JW]
