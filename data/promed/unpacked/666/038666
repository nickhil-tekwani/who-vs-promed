[ProMED-mail thanks Dan Silver for submitting this report.

The name of the new bunyavirus is not given in this report, nor of the 36 previous cases mentioned above or if a tick bite was involved. Coincidentally, in the adjoining province, Anhui, since April of this year (2020), Jinzhai County has had 23 people admitted to hospital after tick bites and 5 died. Some of these cases were attributed to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) after being bitten by ticks. It is reasonable to suspect that SFTS is the new bunyavirus involved with these cases. Additional information about the clinical picture and laboratory tests results for the 37 Jiangsu cases would be appreciated. - Mod.TY
