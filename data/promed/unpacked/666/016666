Around 10 cows, 5 buffalos, calves, sheep, and goats have died of a contagious disease in Belo town and its adjoining areas during a week. According to local sources, the actual number of cattle that died of this disease could be much higher than the given numbers.

Mohammad Ibrahim, a local cattle breeder, said that the lungs of an animal are badly affected by this disease and it develops a high-grade fever. The disease barely takes 2 to 3 days to kill the animal. The heavy fever makes the animal lazy, the throat of the animal starts swelling causing difficulty in breathing that results in its death; he said.

The poor residents in the rural areas of the district rely on cattle heads as their major source of livelihood have sustained huge financial loss and the disease is likely to play more havoc in these areas if the measures were not taken.

[According to the above information, apparently collected from laymen, the "contagious" disease, affecting simultaneously large and small ruminants, is characterised by fever and a relatively short (2-3 days) duration when fatal. Lungs are "badly affected" (gross pathology?) and throats swell. In the absence of data on the size of the affected populations, per species, morbidity and fatality rates are unknown.

One of the diseases which deserves to be excluded is bluetongue, caused by culicoides-borne orbiviruses. Bluetongue, a seasonal disease, is endemic in Pakistan. There are also bacterial pathogens that deserve to be excluded.

An early veterinary investigation is warranted. Further information from knowledgeable sources on those results will be appreciated.
