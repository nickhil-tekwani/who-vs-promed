Fighting roosters spreading disease?
---------------------------------
The moment the roosters are released, they flap their wings wildly
and attack. With sharpened razors tied to their claws, the
well-trained birds slash into each other, sending blood spurting.
Such fights don't end until one bird is too weak to go on. It usually
dies and is tossed into a hole, joining the day's other losers.
Merced County, California, is a popular spot for the battles, and
officials are concerned that an outbreak of exotic Newcastle disease
could result.
The state's $3.2 billion poultry industry says cockfighting has
played a role in spreading the disease, which has led to the deaths
of more than 2 million chickens in California.
"The fighting birds are moved around the state without regard to
quarantines," said Bill Mattos, president of the Modesto-based
California Poultry Federation. "They don't go to veterinarians.
They're not vaccinated."
That concern is echoed by the state Department of Food and
Agriculture and valley law enforcement, which say cockfighting is
growing in popularity despite being illegal since 1905.
"We've done several seizures at cockfights and found sick birds,"
said Frank Swiggart, a detective with the Merced County Sheriff's
Department. "When we've had them checked, it turns out they're
carrying diseases."
That worries officials because Merced County is home to Foster Farms
Poultry. The Livingston-based company produces more than 90 percent
of California's chicken meat.
Newcastle hasn't been found in the valley, but officials say it only
takes one bird to bring it in. The spread of Newcastle disease is
rapid. Newcastle doesn't only kill the birds it infects; it forces
the destruction of any birds in the vicinity. The disease spreads
rapidly and can infect an entire barn before the first bird shows any
sign of sickness.
Newcastle and cockfighting have been hot topics in the valley's
agricultural community since the first case was confirmed in October
2002, in 6 backyard flocks in Los Angeles. Some of those flocks had
hens for laying eggs, state agricultural officials said. Other flocks
had roosters, the type used for cockfighting. Officials believe
cockfighting is one reason Newcastle spread swiftly in Southern
California, despite a quarantine. It was recently found in backyard
flocks in Nevada and Arizona. Agricultural inspectors have yet to
identify how Newcastle was brought to those out-of-state flocks, but
law enforcement has an idea.
"We'll raid a fight in Merced County and find people from Nevada, New
Mexico, Mexico, Arizona, and Southern California," Swiggart said.
"They bring birds to fight and take the survivors home. Dead ones are
left here." The roosters could bring Newcastle with them, Mattos
said, or could be infected by another bird and carry the disease home.
A highly contagious, virulent disease, Newcastle is harmless to
humans but a death sentence to poultry, including chickens, turkeys,
squab, and game birds.
"It could be devastating for the poultry industry if Newcastle was
found in the valley," Mattos said. "Foster Farms alone has about 14
000 employees. The economic damage created by an illegal cockfight
could be terrible."
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reimburses commercial
producers for the value of their birds, but there is no compensation
for sales lost when foreign markets ban California poultry.
While it's illegal to raise roosters for fighting, it can be
difficult to prove that's what the birds will be used for, Swiggart
said. "These guys have 2 to 400 roosters, on the pretext of raising
show birds," Swiggart said. "They're tied to stakes, in the open,
and go through a training regimen to make them fighters." It's also
illegal to watch or take part in a cockfight, as well as to possess
the artificial spurs -- called gaffs and slashers -- the birds use to
attack each other.
Trainers disregard law. That hasn't stopped the activity, however.
Swiggart noted that Delhi, Winton, and other rural areas of Merced
County are well known for fighting cocks. Cockfighting played a role
in the spread of Newcastle in 1971. An outbreak led to the deaths of
12 million chickens in California, and the government spent $56
million eradicating the disease.
In Southern California, the 8-county region is under quarantine,
prohibiting poultry from leaving the area.
Since cockfighting is illegal, poultry officials and law enforcement
don't expect their trainers to follow the law.
"Fighting cocks pose the greatest problem because they move from one
place to another and can carry the disease," Mattos said. "They're
not going to announce they're taking a bird into the next state for a
cockfight."
