Maize dwarf mosaic disease in different regions of China is caused by
Sugarcane mosaic virus
J. X. Jiang (Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou,
P.R. China; College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agriculture University, Nanchang,
P.R. China); and College of Agronomy, Jiangxi Agriculture University,
Nanchang, P.R. China; and X. P. Zhou (as for Jiang). Received April 23,
2002; accepted July 16, 2002
Sugarcane mosaic potyvirus (SCMV) was detected by immunocapture RT-PCR in
all 62 maize samples showing dwarf mosaic symptoms from maize grown in 8
maize-growing provinces of China. However, 3 other potyviruses, Maize
dwarf mosaic (MDMV), Sorghum mosaic (SrMV) and Johnsongrass mosaic virus
(JGMV) were not detected in any of the samples.
11 cDNA fragments of ca. 0.8 kilobases covering most of the coat protein
(CP) gene of SCMV were sequenced and analysis indicates that these 11
isolates shared 98.1 to 100 percent identity at the amino acid level.
Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the CP genes from the 11
Chinese isolates as well as 21 SCMV subgroup isolates indicate that these
virus isolates were closely related to SCMV with 97.0 to 98.1 percent
sequence identity at the amino acid level, while relatively lower sequence
identity was found with MDMV-B, SrMV or JGMV.
Based on these results, SCMV can be considered the most common and
important potyvirus infecting maize in China.

[SCMV has been reported in most sugarcane-producing areas in the world,
occasionally causing severe crop losses. There are at least 4 serotypes and
14 strains (A-N) that can be differentiated by their host range, ability to
infect and by the degree of damage they induce, including European maize
dwarf virus, MDMV-B, SCMV-A, SCMV-B, SCMV-D, SCMV-E, SCMV-SC, SCMV-Sabi,
sorghum concentric ringspot virus, and possibly abaca mosaic potyvirus. 2
MDMV strains, A and B, have been distinguished on the basis that MDMV-B
does not infect Johnsongrass [_Sorghum halepense_ (L.) Pers.]. MDMV is not
a serious disease in the tropics and subtropics, mainly due to limited
distribution of aphid vectors. Spread of SCMV is by aphids (at least 25
species), by contact transmission and by burying in soil infected seed cane
stalks containing at least one node from which new shoots arise.
Rather than using botanical sugarcane seed to start a new sugarcane crop,
farmers generally cut mature stalks at harvest into 18-inch pieces
containing at least 1 node and bury them in soil. From buds on these "seed
pieces" shoots will emerge and grow into 8 - 10 foot tall harvestable
stalks in about 12 months. Yearly regrowth from this original planting is
the ratoon crop and is designated as the "first ratoon" or "second ratoon"
depending upon whether it is the first or second regrowth after the "plant
crop". The number of ratoons varies from 1 to many, determined by yield
decline or crop rotation. The average is a plant cane harvest and 2 ratoon
harvests, for a total of 3 harvests from a single planting.
Use of resistant cultivars is the most effective means of disease management.
