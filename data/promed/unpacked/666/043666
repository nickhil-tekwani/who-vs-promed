Another measles case has flown into the Gold Coast from New Zealand, which is experiencing an epidemic of the highly contagious virus.

The case is the 3rd reported on the Gold Coast and the 6th measles case diagnosed in Queensland in the past fortnight. It takes the number of cases in Queensland so far this year to 31, more than double the 14 recorded for the whole of 2018.

The traveller was exposed to measles while visiting New Zealand, which has recorded more than 1600 cases this year [2019].

[2] CDC report
Date: Thu 3 Oct 2019
Source: CDC: Measles Cases and Outbreaks [abridged, edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html


From 1 Jan-3 Oct 2019, 1250 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 31 states. This is an increase of 7 cases from the previous week. However, only 3 of these cases were recently ill. The rest were identified as past cases.

- This is the greatest number of cases reported in the US since 1992. More than 75% of the cases this year [2019] are linked to outbreaks in New York. Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in US communities where groups of people are unvaccinated.

- The majority of cases are among people who were not vaccinated against measles.

- Measles can cause serious complications. From 1 Jan-3 Oct 2019, 119 of the people who got measles this year [2019] were hospitalized, and 61 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

The states that have reported cases to CDC are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. All measles cases this year [2019] have been caused by measles wild-type D8 or B3.

[3] CDC: News scan 7 Oct 2019
Date: Mon 7 Oct 2019. News scan 7 Oct 2019

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/10/news-scan-oct-07-2019


Today the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 7 new US measles cases, bringing the total for 2019 to 1250 infections in 31 states.

The new cases reflect a slight uptick, as the CDC recorded zero and 2 new cases in its previous 2 weekly updates. Cases have slowed dramatically in recent months, however. After posting more than 300 cases in both March and April, officials confirmed 180 in May, 77 in June, 51 in July, 29 in August, and just 5 last month [September] [2019].

The 1250 total cases represent the most in a year since 1992, and the most since the disease was declared eliminated from the country in 2000. The huge increase this year threatened elimination status in the United States but, so far, has not reversed it.

The CDC reported one ongoing outbreak -- defined as 3 or more related cases -- in New York state, the same as last week. State health officials late last week said New York is no longer combatting any of the large outbreaks that had begun in 2018. US outbreaks this year have been linked to measles outbreaks in foreign countries, the CDC said.

[4] New York: unvaccinated adults
Date: Mon 7 Oct 2019

Unvaccinated adults had a "significant" impact on the early days of the New York state measles outbreak, with 51% of cases during the 1st month being attributable to them, according to data presented at IDWeek.

Two measles outbreaks in New York that sickened almost 1000 people -- one in New York City, the other in Rockland County -- have both been declared over. Debra Blog, MD, MPH, director of the division of epidemiology at the New York State Department of Health, and colleagues analyzed data on measles cases occurring outside of New York City from October 2018 to September 2019.

"We wanted to look at the role that adults played in the outbreak," Blog told Infectious Disease News. "There was significant transmission to others for these cases. Most adults -- 82% -- who became ill with measles were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status."

Blog summarized the study findings, noting that although 80% of cases occurred in children, adults did play a significant role in transmission, especially early in the outbreak.

Their study included 371 cases, 79 (21%) in adults, with 4 born before 1957 (3 unvaccinated and one with unknown vaccination status). Of the cases in adults born during or after 1957, 65 (87%) were unvaccinated or had unknown status, 3 had received one dose of vaccine, and 7 had received 2 doses.

The researchers reported that 5 of 11 internationally imported cases were in unvaccinated adults or adults with unknown status. They found that 26 of the 51 cases recorded during the 1st month (51%) were attributable to adults, with 42% of those cases occurring in children.

"The majority of measles cases occurred in unvaccinated children, emphasizing the importance of ongoing and focused efforts on pediatric vaccination," Blog concluded. "However, measles cases in unvaccinated adults played an important role in both importations and disease transmission early in the outbreak."

Six cases of measles have now been confirmed in Southend as day centres, forced to close, officially reopened.

Fears had emerged that more than 200 people may have been exposed following an outbreak at 4 learning disability day centres for adults. The number of cases, which stood at 3 on Friday [4 Oct 2019], rose to 6 over the weekend.

Of the 8 initial suspected cases, one has been ruled out, while another is still awaiting test results.

A number of day centres were forced to close after the announcement last Wednesday [2 Oct 2019], with all centres reopening yesterday [Mon 7 Oct 2019].

Rebecca Dockett, 35, from Southend, who works with young disabled people, said the closures will have affected many.

"I do understand the decision by the council to close these centres, but we must make sure our people living with these difficulties do not miss out too much," she said. "I hope this whole situation will be sorted, and it is good news that our centres have reopened. These services are a lifeline and vital way for people with difficulties to connect with each other and the outside world. I agree it is a necessary precaution, but you hope it will not have affected too many."

Last week, the council confirmed 50 people were given vaccinations, with more vaccinated on Monday [7 Oct 2019], although exact numbers are unclear.

So far, 76 people have called Southend's public information line, which will be open from 8 a.m. to midday tomorrow [Wed 9 Oct 2019], before closing as the number of calls has rapidly reduced.

Four centres -- Project 49, Salvation Army Hadleigh Training Centre, RE House, and Summer Care Day Centre -- all closed last week and then reopened yesterday [Mon 7 Oct 2019].

Project 49 reopened with a limited programme, and those unable to attend due to the situation are being contacted directly.

A spokesman for Southend Council thanked Southend Clinical Commissioning Group for the support.

In one week, Pernambuco recorded 14 new cases of measles. According to the latest epidemiological bulletin released on Wednesday [9 Oct 2019] by the State Department of Health (SES), the state has accumulated, in 2019, 37 confirmations of the disease. Since the beginning of the year [2019], 799 suspected viruses have been reported in Pernambuco cities. Among the investigated cases, 284 were discarded and 515 are still under evaluation. The state is one of 16 federation units with active disease outbreak in Brazil.

The municipalities with confirmed measles cases in Pernambuco are as follows: Northern Taquaritinga (14), Caruaru (6), Strands (5), Recife (3), Capibaribe Holy Cross (3), Toritama (3), Calves (1), Friar Miguelinho (1), Jaboatao of the Guararapes (1).

Despite the significant number of new confirmations, the state secretary of health, Andre Longo, considers that the new cases included in the newsletter are old. "These are people who fell ill between July and August [2019]. All measures to treat patients and investigate and block new cases are implemented soon after notification," he says.

According to the secretary, regardless of the positive result after laboratory tests, suspected cases are treated as if it were a confirmed case. The intention, according to the SES, is to prevent sequelae and deaths in patients and death and minimize the possibility of contagion. With the strengthening of vaccination, until 4 Oct [2019], 507 814 people were immunized with the triple virus in Pernambuco.

Among the number of vaccinated patients, 215 986 doses were administered to children between 6 months and 4 years. The figures also reveal that the state was able to achieve 98% coverage in the 1st dose of the triple virus in one-year-olds. In the 2nd dose, which should be done 3 months after the 1st dose, the coverage is lower: 74.5%.

According to the Ministry of Health, children are the most susceptible to complications and deaths from measles, since the incidence of cases in children under one year is 9 times higher than the general population. The 2nd-most-affected age group is 1-4 years.

Since the 2nd half of August [2019], immunization of infants between 6 months and 11 months with the triple virus has been instituted throughout Brazil. Until then, the vaccination schedule of the 3 diseases began only after the 1st year. After administration of the "zero dose," it will still be necessary to follow the basic vaccination schedule from 12 months, with one more dose and a booster at 15 months.

Little coverage of 2nd dose of vaccine in children is still worrying in Pernambuco Although Pernambuco has already reached the minimum target of vaccination of the 1st dose of the triple viral in children up to 12 months, the index was not reached in the set of municipalities of I and VIII Regional Health Management (Abreu e Lima, Aracoiaba, Cabo de St. Augustine, Camaragibe, Big Ch, Tea of Joy, Glory of Goita, Fernando de Noronha, Igarassu, Ipojuca, Itamaraca, Itapissuma, Jaboatao of the Guararapes, Moreno, Olinda, Paulista, Pigeons, Reef, Sao Lourenco da Mata Antao, Afranio, Cabrobo, Sleepers, Big Pond, Oroco, Petrolina, Santa Maria da Boa Vista).

"These are populated areas that have a large circulation of tourists all the time. That is why the importance of intensifying actions and actively searching to avoid pockets of unprotected children," points out the superintendent of immunization of the State Department of Health (SES-PE), Ana Catarina de Melo. According to her, regarding the 2nd dose of the vaccine, considered essential for the protection of children, only the Geres de Palmares and Salgueiro were able to reach the minimum target of 95%.

Children between 6 months and under one year old, residing in the following 9 municipalities, should [get vaccinated] take one dose of the triple viral: Recife, Paulista, Calves, Caruaru, Santa Cruz do Capibaribe, Taquaritinga do Norte, Vertentes, Friar Miguelinho, and Salgueiro. Importantly, these children will need to follow the normal immunization schedule from 12 months.

At the moment, vaccination is still indicated for children from 6 months to under one year who are going to move to municipalities with an active measles outbreak. Immunization must be done at least 15 days before travel.

Measles killed 246 children in one month in the Basankusu health zone. The epidemic is currently raging in 12 health zones in [Equateur]. Civil society organizations are launching an SOS in the face of the scale of this epidemic.

The coordinator of the citizen movement ECCHA / Basankusu, Christian Boketsu, says that after his visit Mon 7 Oct 2019 through hospitals and health institutions, he noted "a total of 246 deaths in this territory. Patients are abandoned because of lack of medication."

Provincial health minister / Equateur, Bruno Efoloko, confirms that this measles outbreak has been reported since the 36th week in 12 health zones in the province. He said that as far as Basankusu was concerned, "WHO is planning to go down there soon in its 2nd phase of intervention." This includes the "free measles care, but also the strengthening of routine vaccination with a double dose of vaccine."

Dr. Bruno Efoloko lamented the fact that "many parents were hiding their children, saying that measles cannot be cured in the hospital. This caused this high mortality."

More than 4000 people have died in Congo this year [2019] in the world's largest measles outbreak, the UN's children's agency said Wednesday [9 Oct 2019]. Since January [2019], more than 200 000 cases of measles have been reported across Congo, UNICEF said. More than 140 000 involve children under 5, who also make up nearly 90% of deaths. UNICEF said health workers were rushing additional medical kits to help care for more than 110 000 people infected with the measles, a highly contagious and potentially deadly virus. More than 1.4 million children have been vaccinated this year [2019]. - Mod.LK]

Three cases of measles have been confirmed in Rustenburg, the North West health department said on Wednesday [9 Oct 2019]. Cases of suspected measles were reported at Luka, Seraleng, and Ikemeleng.

"The 1st case is of a 3-year-old from Ikemeleng Kroondal who had [a] history of travel to Mozambique in September [2019]. Case 2 is a one month old from Luka who was admitted at Job Shimankane Tabane Hospital with severe fever and diarrhoea. Case 3 is aged 11-year-old from Seraleng," said spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane.

"All the cases have been confirmed by NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases] through [a] blood test; 22 other specimens from suspects are also being tested. The outbreak was declared last week."

Nine teams of health officials have been dispatched to execute massive outreach campaigns aimed at immunising children under the age of 15 years as a way to curb the situation.

Measles is a viral infection that can be fatal amongst children. It affects children especially under the age of 5, yet it is preventable by a vaccine.

It spreads through the air by respiratory droplets produced from coughing or sneezing. Complications caused by measles include blindness, brain swelling, severe diarrhoea, and related dehydration, ear infections, and pneumonia.

Research has indicated that one out of every 1000 measles cases progresses to permanent brain damage.
