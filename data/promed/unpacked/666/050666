In reply to the moderator response to this anthrax outbreak in the ProMED-mail archived post 20150828.3607163, I would like to comment.

[1] Historically, flooding of land is known to be an event which can potentially lead to new cases of anthrax, as the flood waters can bring buried anthrax spores to the surface of the pasture.

[2] I would like to point out that the combination of strict EU-wide Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) and Animal By-Product (ABP) regulations prevent the use of meat and bone meal in farm animal feed, except for low-risk Category 3-derived fishmeal to non-ruminant animals such as pigs and poultry and low-risk Category 3-derived processed animal proteins of non-ruminant origin to aquaculture animals, i.e. farmed fish.

[Dave is correct on both. Land flooding is associated with repeated outbreaks of anthrax. The question, though, is why this time an outbreak followed but not in previous years, assuming that the latter is correct and prior unexpected deaths were not just ignored. Which is why I prefer to walk around an outbreak site with the farmer and get a better appreciation of what did occur and possible explanations, and then undertake further sampling.

Slovenia has been a member of the EU since 1 May 2004, and of the Eurozone since 1 Jan 2007. So meat and bone meal is forbidden to be fed to farm livestock. So while regulations and reality on the ground can differ, there is a presumption that these 7 heifers were not exposed to contaminated bone meal. Which pushes the speculation to look for the possible source in this pasture that was flooded in 2014. I recommend that any Slovene wishing to do that should look for signs of an old cattle grave, i.e., a sunken area of 2-4 sq. ms of a size and shape that one would expect for an old grave, and sample the soil there in say 6 places or more. And any positive recovery must genomically match the cultures taken from the dead heifers. Good luck! And thanks to Dave for his comments. - Mod MHJ
