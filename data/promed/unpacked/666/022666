BARLEY YELLOW DWARF VIRUS AND STEM RUST, CEREALS - KENYA

About 140 000 hectares of wheat worth millions of shillings could go
to waste this season following an outbreak of the dreaded wheat stem
rust fungus in the country, experts have warned. The disease has been
detected in Narok District, the highest producer of wheat and barley
in the country.
Wheat stem rust is a fungal disease and its symptoms are small yellow
flecks that develop into long, narrow yellow blisters on the stem,
leaves, and leaf sheaths of young seedlings. The blisters break open,
revealing a powdery mass of brick-red spores. The spores are
dispersed by the wind to other plants where they germinate, invade
the plant, and produce more pustules.
Mr Naphtali Mureithi, executive director of the leading agrochemical
firm Orion East Africa Limited, said it was feared the disease could
spread to Ethiopia and the Middle East countries, where wheat farming
is the main economic activity. "We have visited wheat fields in Narok
with researchers from the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute
(KARI) to assess the magnitude of the outbreak," Mureithi added.
However, he said planting wheat varieties resistant to the disease
and spraying the affected crops with fungicides could contain the
disease.
Sounding the alarm, Mureithi also said that another 30 000 hectares
(74 132 acres) of barley under cultivation in the same region is
under the threat from barley yellow dwarf virus. Speaking during a
food security meeting in Nakuru at the weekend, Mureithi said the
virus was spreading fast to wheat fields in the neighbouring
districts and called for urgent intervention. "The disease is
ravaging large hectares of wheat in Narok and it is spreading to the
escarpments. This is a serious disease problem which could cause
serious loss to wheat farmers," Mureithi said.

[Wheat stem rust (black rust) is caused by the fungus _Puccinia
graminis_ f.sp. _tritici_. It occurs worldwide throughout wheat
producing areas. Yield losses of up to 70 percent occur, and some
fields are totally destroyed. Dispersal is by wind and with infected
straw.
New races are emerging with increased virulence against genes
previously used for resistance breeding. The most dangerous, at
present, is strain Ug99, which was 1st reported in Uganda in 1999.
Recurring epidemics in Kenya and then Ethiopia followed and it has
recently spread to Yemen. It may also be present in Pakistan, Sudan,
and Tanzania. Ug99 is considered to be a significant threat to global
wheat production, and in response the international Global Rust
Initiative was set up.
Although the strain of stem rust causing the outbreak reported here
is not mentioned, it seems likely that it is Ug99.
_Barley yellow dwarf virus_ (BYDV; genus _Luteovirus_, family
_Luteoviridae_) is distributed worldwide and the most destructive of
virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced by one third. It
attacks a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_) including wheat,
oats, rice, maize, rye, and barley. Symptoms include leaf
discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species),
stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. The virus occurs
in several strains, which can be transmitted by more than 20 species
of aphids. It cannot be transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical
means and cannot survive in stubble or in the soil. Disease
management includes use of resistant cultivars and control of the
aphid vectors.
BYDV was reported for the 1st time in Kenya in 1983, and it has led
to reduced barley and wheat production since its introduction.
