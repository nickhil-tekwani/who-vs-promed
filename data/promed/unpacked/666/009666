meningitis*, and myelitis)
** cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** cases for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET
by state and local health departments.
"Neuroinvasive disease" refers to severe disease cases, particularly
West Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
"West Nile fever" refers to typically less severe cases that show no
evidence of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the
list of nationally notifiable diseases, and, therefore, it is
optional whether or not state health departments report these cases
to CDC. [Further explanations of neuroinvasive West Nile virus
disease and West Nile fever can be found on the CDC website at the
URL provided above].
"Other" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than WN
fever, WN encephalitis, or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid paralysis.
"Unspecified" cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
"Total human cases reported to CDC:" These numbers reflect both mild
and severe human disease cases occurring since 1 Jan 2007, reported
to ArboNET by state and local health departments. ArboNET is the
national electronic surveillance system established by CDC to assist
states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne viruses.
Information regarding 2007 virus/disease activity is posted when such
cases are reported to CDC.

-----------------------------------------------
Data are being collected from state and local health departments on a
weekly basis and are reported to the CDC ArboNET for the following 5
categories: wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance. Maps detailing
county-level wild birds, sentinel chicken flocks, human cases,
veterinary cases, and mosquito surveillance data are published each
week on the collaborative USGS (US Geological Survey)/CDC West Nile
virus website.

been found in Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, North Dakota,
Oregon, Puerto Rico, and Utah. [Note: not all states have WNV
sentinel programs. - Mods.JW/TY]
WNV equine infections have been reported from Arizona, California,
Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi,

[5] USA: Vermont bird: 1st report
Date: 1 Sep 2007

A dead crow found in Brattleboro VT was confirmed to be a carrier of
West Nile Virus Friday by the Vermont Department of Health. The bird,
which was turned over to the department 13 Aug [2007] and tested
positive on Aug. 29, is the first confirmed case of the virus in
Vermont this year.
Last year [2006], 9 birds tested positive, though none were found in
Windham County. In 2004, one bird found in the county tested
positive. This was down from 25 reported cases in Windham County in
2003, one of which was a human.
So far this year [2007], the health department has received 279 dead
bird reports. The state tests dead birds, traps and tests mosquitoes
and tests people and horses that have symptoms consistent with the virus.
The health department tests crows, robins, jays, ravens, osprey,
hawks, owls, falcons, vultures and eagles for West Nile virus. These
bird species are the most important for indicating the presence of
West Nile virus in Vermont.

[It would be interesting to see the denominators for each species of
bird tested. I wonder if the majority were crows, and the minority
were raptors. To be of maximum usefulness for surveillance, the
turn-round time for testing needs to be as short as possible. - Mod.JW]
