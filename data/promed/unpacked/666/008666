Specialists on full alert following outbreak of botulism
-----------------------------------------------
A serious disease outbreak in the northern province of Nan had Army weapons
specialists and US disease investigators on full alert Mon 20 Mar 2006.
Almost 150 people in the province have been stricken with botulism, a rare,
often lethal bacterial disease that could potentially be used as a
biological weapon. Health authorities have sought international assistance
in treating the patients. US military biological weapons experts have been
flown into Nan, as have WHO disease specialists, said Thai Disease Control
Department chief Thawat Suntharacharn.
Since 4 Mar 2006, 143 villagers in Nan's Ban Luang district have been
diagnosed as suffering from botulism, a disease caused by toxins produced
by several members of a group of bacteria known as _Clostridium botulinum_.
All of the patients reported having eaten dishes containing preserved
bamboo shoots from the same batch at a merit-making feast in their village
last week. Shortly after eating the shoots they began to suffer similar
symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty swallowing, dry mouths
and muscle weakness, Nan chief health officer Dr. Pisit Sriprasert said on
Sun 19 Mar 2006. Of the 147, 33 are currently breathing with the aid of
respirators, he said.
"Botulism is among the diseases that can be used as a biological warfare
agent; the others include anthrax and smallpox," said Thawat. Fears of a
biological attack arose because of the number of people falling ill at one
time.

Emergency antitoxin from Canada, UK, US and Japan for Nan botulism incident
-----------------------------------------------
An occurrence of botulism that is possibly the worst incident on record
worldwide has brought emergency shipments of antitoxin from Canada, England
and the USA, while Thai health authorities are seeking further supplies
from Japan.
Thai and international health officials called for antitoxin serum from USA
CDC, from England, and from Canada to treat more than 100 villagers in
Thailand's northern Nan province who contracted botulism from contaminated
bamboo shoots prepared in a traditional manner.
The head of Thailand's Communicable Disease Control Department, Dr. Thawat
Suntracharn, said that 168 villagers contracted botulism -- a rare
neuromuscular disease that is often fatal -- after eating the
traditionally-prepared bamboo shoots that had been stored in aluminum trays.
Among the villagers, 143 were admitted to hospital, with 33 of them needing
respirators to assist their breathing, another 36 awaiting medical
examinations to determine whether they need respirators, while the
remaining 74 patients are hospitalized under close medical supervision.
The number of the patients intoxicated by botulinum is the largest reported
incident of botulism ever in Thailand, and perhaps in the world, Dr. Thawat
said.
Normally, Thailand experiences only one or 2 patients per year from the
illness annually.
Bamboo shoot products on shelves and in the markets were collected and
destroyed by the provincial public health office, Dr. Thawat said.

[Classically, botulism is a foodborne disease caused by the ingestion of
preformed toxin, although there also exists wound botulism (in which _C.
botulinum_ spores germinate in a wound), and infant botulism (in which the
spores germinate in the intestinal tract). There are a number of types of
botulism toxins that are immunologically distinct and work at a variety of
sites of the neuromuscular junction to block acetylcholine neuromuscular
transmission. Although large clusters of botulism bring up the specter of
bioterrorism, no clear support of this is found in the postings.
