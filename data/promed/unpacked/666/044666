A cholera epidemic in the district of Allada, some 50 km north of Cotonou,
has killed nine persons out of the 250 cases recorded, the ministry of
Social Protection and Family said Monday. The ministry of Public Health has
sent about 50 doctors and 15 nurses to the area to treat those affected as
well as immunize the population against the disease.

Following notification of an increase in cholera cases at the main hospital
by the chief of the Rumonge health district, a team from Medecins sans
frontieres and WHO went to the area to investigate and to initiate control
measures. From 24 May to 5 June [1999 a total of 89 cases with 6 deaths had
occurred. No cases have been reported among the refugees from the Democratic
Republic of the Congo who passed through the area during that period.
The cause of the outbreak was probably the early onset of the dry season and
consequent drinking of water from the lake, as well as lack of prevention
measures by the population. Action was taken to provide ORS and medicaments
as well as clean water by truck. Epidemiological surveillance was also
strengthened. A committee met to mobilize the resources and to coordinate
the measures of the aid agencies.
A cumulative total of 587 cases had previously been reported in Burundi
since the beginning of the year.

The majority of cases has occurred in several districts of Mahajanga (3365
cases 215 deaths) since the beginning of the outbreak in March this year up
to 15 June [1999. A total of 642 cases and 3 deaths occurred in
Antananarivo Province up to the same date.
The cholera outbreak which began in late March has stabilized in the 2
provinces affected, and the number of reported cases has declined
considerably during recent weeks. In Antananarivo province, the situation
has been less acute than in Mahajanga province. There is a risk that some
districts in Mahajanga province (Mahajanga I and II, Marovoay and Mitsinjo)
may become endemic. Some cases have also been reported recently in
Antsiranana province, Nosy Be district.
Strict control measures were implemented during the early stages of the
outbreak, including: care of suspect cases in health centres and hospitals,
and treatment of contacts; disinfection and other hygiene measures in
treatment centres, as well as in patients' homes; widespread campaigns to
educate and inform the public; and epidemiological surveillance.
Notification of cases to WHO and information on the areas infected have been
very regular and in conformity with the requirements of the International
Health Regulations. It has therefore been possible to give a true picture of
the situation, thus avoiding unfounded rumours which could affect trade and
tourism in the country. There is no reason for travellers/tourists to
postpone travel to Madagascar as the risk of infection is negligible if
basic hygiene measures are taken.

An outbreak has occurred in Boboye District, Dosso Department, which is
approximately 100 km east of Niamey. The first cases were reported in June
and as of 30 July [1999 the total number is 169 cases with 10 deaths.
Thirty-six villages were affected. Control measures which were taken at the
early stages of the outbreak have helped to decrease the numbers of cases
and since 28 July only 1 or 2 cases are occurring daily.
The Minister of Public Health visited the area to make the public aware of
the situation and to encourage the field teams for their work. Various
materials and medicines were supplied by UNICEF, WHO and "Italian
Cooperation" both in the districts affected and in other regions in case of
spread.
Cholera outbreaks occur in Niger fairly regularly although no cases were
reported in 1998. A total of 259 cases with 13 deaths was reported in 1997
and a larger outbreak with 3957 cases and 206 deaths in 1996.

An outbreak of cholera in northern Nigeria has killed more than 100 people
in the past month, a senior local official said Monday. "There is an
outbreak of cholera which has killed more than 100 people," Musa Kankara,
spokesman for Katsina State Governor Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, told AFP by
telephone from Katsina.
Kankara said he could not confirm reports in the Nigerian press Monday,
quoting Katsina State Commissioner for Health Ahmed Musa Bindawa, that more
than 400 people had died. "I don't think that 400 people have died," Kankara
said. Bindawa was not available Monday to confirm the media reports.
The official said that the outbreak began one month ago [July 1999 and the
state government has sought assistance from the federal government and
international organizations. "We have mounted a vigorous enlightenment
campaign, on radio and television in the area," the official said. Most of
the victims lived in isolated villages in the mainly rural state, with
people in 31 out of 34 local government areas affected, Kankara said.
Cholera, a waterborne disease that is fatal if untreated, is endemic to
Nigeria because of poor water quality and sanitation in many districts.

A cholera epidemic has spread through a refugee community in central
Afghanistan, killing more than 660 people in the last 10 days, most of them
children, opposition spokesman Mohammed Arif said Tuesday.
Arif said 250 000 people who fled the fighting north of Kabul are huddled
homeless in the Panjshir Valley, the stronghold of opposition leader Ahmed
Shah Massood. The conditions are horrific, Arif told The Associated Press in
a satellite telephone interview. "We have no shelter for these people,'' he
said. "They are living under the trees.''
Arif's figures or information about the epidemic could not be independently
confirmed. A delegation from the U.N. High Commission for Refugees is
visiting the Panjshir Valley to assess the conditions. The refugees fled to
the Panjshir Valley, about 60 miles north of Kabul, after heavy fighting
broke out last month between the Taliban religious army which rules most of
Afghanistan and the northern-based alliance.

Cholera claims 10 lives in remote Pakistani northern area
Ten children have died of cholera in Pakistan's remote northern area of
Skardu in a diarrhea epidemic that has hit hundreds of people, hospital
sources said Saturday.
The district hospital in Skardu town, around 300 kilometers (187 miles) from
Islamabad, has been receiving 200 to 250 outdoor patients for the past four
weeks, the hospital's head doctor Kamaluddin Soomro told AFP by phone.
Skardu, gateway to the Karokoram mountain range, lies near the disputed
border in Kashmir where the Pakistani and Indian armies fought a two-month
conflic this summer. Soomro said the Skardu hospital had been flooded with
patients, mostly women and children, from families displaced during the
fighting from villages on the dividing Line of Control in Kashmir. Extra
beds have been arranged in the corridors of the hospital to cope with the
rush and only the most serious are being admitted, he said. Cholera cases
have also been reported in the Haripur area, around 80 kilometers (miles)
northwest of Islamabad.

Russia imposed restrictions on movements across the border with China in a
bid to stop the spread of cholera into its Maritime territory, the Russian
Far East, a spokesman for the Pacific regional directorate of the Russian
Border Service told Itar-Tass on Wednesday. The extraordinary anti-epidemic
measures were prompted by 2 cholera cases registered in the Maritime
territory. Both victims were drivers from Ussuriysk who were recently back
from a trip to China. Chinese citizens can go to China unhindered. Russian
tourists can also return home from China, although the way
back has been blocked, the Russian Border Service said. The same border
passage rules are effective for automobile transport.

The Chinese Health Ministry on Wednesday declined to confirm or deny reports
about the incidence of cholera in the Chinese territory neighbouring on
Russia's Primorsky Krai (Maritime territory). "The people responsible for
those reports are not available," a ministry official told Itar-Tass.
Authorities in the Heilongjiang province have meanwhile admitted that 2
cases have been registered, provisionally diagnosed as "acute intestinal
infection." According to the authorities, it is too early to speak about an
epidemic of cholera, and this is why they have failed to notify the Russian
authorities about the diseases.

Russian epidemiologists registered several outbreaks of infectious diseases
in children´s leisure camps in the past week, a spokesman for the Russian
health protection ministry said on Friday. An outbreak of dysentery which
affected 77 children and 4 adults was registered in the Kalininsky district
of the Tver region in Central European Russia, the spokesman told Itar-Tass.
According to medical experts, the children got the disease from contaminated
food. A special commission set up to look into causes of the outbreak
decided to close down the camp.
Another outbreak of dysentery affected the Olymp children's camp close to
the city of Rubtsovsk in the Southern Siberian Altai territory, where 87
children and 4 adults had to be taken to hospitals in medium grave
condition, the spokesman said. Medical experts believe that the disease
could have been caused by ice-cream made by the local milk-processing plant.
Its work has been halted and the camp is temporarily closed, the spokesman
added.

A number of outbreaks of infectious diseases were registered in Russian
regions this week. Fifty-two of the patients in a mental hospital in Chita,
Transbaikal region, developed an acute intestinal infection, Tass earnt from
the Russian Health Ministry on Thursday. Laboratory analysis has already
established dysentery in 16 cases. Since the disease mostly has a light
form, the patients undergo treatment without being transferred to a hospital
for infectious diseases. Epidemiologists believe that this intestinal
infection was caused by impure water. Water wells of the hospital were
found to be in an unsatisfactory state. No more mental patients are being
checked into the hospital at present.
Acute intestinal infection was registered among students of the Stavropol
Agricultural Academy engaged in agricultural work in Georgiyevsky district
of the Stavropol territory, southern Russia. Twenty-four people affected by
the infection have been hospitalised on suspicion on dysentery. The outbreak
of the disease may have been caused by the consumption of home-prepared
perishable products.
