MORA COUNTY, New MexicoÂ– The state is reporting a new case of anthrax in
Mora County, on the same ranch where the bacteria killed a cow this summer.
Blood tests confirmed a cow dumped in a Raton landfill was infected with
anthrax.
Ranchers vaccinated the rest of the herd, but one cow that came into the
herd did not get its shots and contracted anthrax. It died three days ago.

[Inquiries with the authorities in Albuquerque reveal that the animal was
buried on the affected farm, near Wagon Mound, NM, not in a landfill.
Further details are being sought as winter cases of anthrax are unusual
unless exposed to contaminated fodder or feed. - Mod.MHJ
