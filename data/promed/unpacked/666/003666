Re: Epi update on Legionnaires' disease outbreak in Lazise, Italy,
July-August 2011. European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control,
ECDC
(http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/2011_09_TER_legionnaire_italy.pdf)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 11 cases of travel-associated Legionnaires' disease (TALD)
in one month, associated with 4 accommodation sites in the town of
Lazise, Italy suggests a community outbreak from a point source.
Intensive environmental investigations are underway in Italy to
identify the source of this outbreak. As Legionnaires' disease cannot
be transmitted from human to human, the risk in the European Union
remains limited to current (and possibly future) visitors to this area
and local residents. Cases are tourists from Austria, Denmark,
Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.

In accordance with Decision No 2119/98/EC of the European Parliament
and of the Council of 24 September 1998, surveillance and control of
the disease is organised at the European level through the European
Legionnaires' disease surveillance network (ELDSNet). A European case
definition has been established for surveillance purposes. As part of
the network activities, countries notify data detailing individual
TALD cases on a daily basis. Identified clusters of TALD are shared
with all Member States through ELDSNet. Risk assessments of
accommodation sites associated with the cluster are undertaken by the
Member State in which the accommodation site is located, reported to
ECDC and shared with the network.

Since 16 Aug 2011, 11 cases of TALD have been notified to the ELDSNet
Surveillance Network. All cases -- 7 residents from the Netherlands,
one from Italy, one from Austria, one from Germany, and one from
Denmark -- stayed at 4 different accommodation sites in the touristic
town of Lazise, Italy between 7 Jul 2011 (first arrival) and 31 Aug
2011 (last departure). Dates of onset range from 18 Jul 2011 to 24 Aug
2011. All 11 cases have been confirmed by urinary antigen test. The
average age of the cases is 54 years (youngest 42 years, oldest 78
years) and the gender distribution is 10 males/1 female.

Microbiological details are available for 2 cases. Sequence-based
molecular typing showed that both the Danish case and one of the Dutch
cases has sequence type 23. In addition, the monoclonal subtype has
been determined for the same Danish case as Allentown/France
(serogroup 1).

After the 1st TALD cases were reported by the Netherlands through the
ELDSNet network (15-17 Aug 2011), epidemiological and environmental
investigations were immediately initiated by the authorities in Italy.
The National Institute of Health is supporting the local authorities
in Lazise with local investigations.

Three of the accommodation sites are located south of the town centre,
with 2 sites (where 8 of the cases stayed) situated within 500 m [0.3
mi] of each other. As yet no risk installations have been identified
as probable sources. It is known that the water supply for the
accommodation sites is different. Local risk assessment is ongoing and
several water samples have been collected for testing by the Regional
and National Reference Laboratories in Italy. Preliminary results show
that _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 was isolated from a shower
at one of the accommodation sites. Sub-typing of these isolates is
ongoing, as well as analysis of additional samples from other
suspected sources at different locations in Lazise.

Local hospitals and general practitioners in the area have been
alerted to support case-findings and accommodation sites have been
briefed on the situation. ECDC supported the preparation of letters to
inform guests who have been staying at the different accommodation
sites and current guests are being informed via leaflets. In addition,
information is provided about the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease
and guests are advised to seek medical care if they experience
suspected symptoms. Precautionary control measures, such as
hyperchlorination and the switching off of all aerosol-producing
devices (spa pools, decorative fountains, sprinklers) were taken on 23
and 26 Aug 2011.

In Italy, there is no compulsory registration of wet cooling systems,
as is the case in other EU countries [KD Ricketts, C Joseph, J Lee, G
Wewalka. European Working Group for Legionella infections: Survey on
legislation regarding wet cooling systems in European countries.
Eurosurveillance 13(38) 18 Sep 2008;
http://www.eurosurveillance.org/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=18982].
Lazise is a small town located about 20 km [12.5 mi] northwest of
Verona. It has a population of 7000 inhabitants
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise] and there are an estimated 60
000 visitors to the town during the tourist season.

The age and profile of reported cases in the current outbreak is
typical for a Legionnaires' disease outbreak, as is the attack rate
for a community outbreak, if we assume a 0.1-0.5 percent attack rate
in a population estimated at 15 000 residents in Lazise over a
one-month period. The disease has principally affected tourists
visiting Lazise (and more specifically those staying at 4 identified
accommodation sites in a localised area of the town), which strongly
suggests the existence of a contaminated installation or device at or
in the near proximity of the accommodation sites.

As no evidence has yet been found to incriminate one specific source
it is unknown whether the source, and thus risk for exposure, has now
been eliminated. During local investigations at the associated
accommodation sites, the simultaneous implementation of control
measures, such as hyperchlorination, might have diminished the risk
for further exposure. However, as long as there is no strong evidence
found for one or more sources, the exposure might persist or reappear
in the coming weeks and months depending on the effectiveness of
precautionary measures.

To support the epidemiological investigation to find a probable
source, the Member States investigators involved have elaborated a
common questionnaire. ECDC has been actively supporting the
collaboration through the Epidemic Intelligence Information System
(EPIS) for ELDSNet, and will facilitate the data collection. A
specific ad-hoc discussion forum has been opened in EPIS ELDSNet.

An important finding is the determination of the monoclonal subtype
(from Denmark) and especially the DNA sequence type of the strain for
2 clinical isolates (from Denmark and the Netherlands). This will
potentially allow the matching of the strain to any positive water
samples identified in attempts to assess the source. However, it
should be noted that in a significant proportion of outbreaks no
source can be found.

[The document above reports the findings of an on-going
epidemiological and microbiological investigation of the Legionnaires'
disease outbreak among tourists in Lazise. Italy. All 11 cases -- 7
residents from the Netherlands, one from Italy, one from Austria, one
from Germany, and one from Denmark -- have been confirmed to have been
infected by _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 on the basis of a
positive urinary antigen test and stayed at 4 different accommodation
sites in Lazise between 7 Jul 2011 (1st arrival) and 31 Aug 2011 (last
departure). We await report of subsequent findings.

Veneto is one of the 20 regions of Italy, with a population is about 5
million. It is located along the Adriatic coast in the northeastern
part of Italy and its capital is Venice. Lazise is a town along the
eastern shores of Lake Garda in the Province of Verona in the Veneto
region, with a population of 6213 in 2004. It is located about 120 km
(75 mi) west of Venice and about 20 km (12 mi) northwest of Verona
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazise). A map of Italy on which the
Veneto region can be located is at
