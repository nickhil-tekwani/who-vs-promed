A 64-year-old from Petrusburg in the Northern Cape who fell ill after
being bitten by a tick has been diagnosed as having the deadly Congo
fever. Medically known as Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [CCHF], the
disease has no cure and can kill sufferers within days. Symptoms may
include bleeding from all orifices of the body. The farmer became the
5th person to have contracted the disease in South Africa this year
[2010]. All the cases were confirmed by a state laboratory.

The farmer was bitten by a _Hyalomma_ tick last Thursday [30 Dec 2010]
and 2 days later he developed flu-like symptoms including fever,
headaches and body pains. The farmer was then taken to Kimberley
Hospital Complex, where he is being treated for CCHF.

Professor Lucille Blumberg of the National Institute of Communicable
Diseases yesterday confirmed that the Petrusburg farmer was suffering
from the dreaded CCHF after being bitten by a tick. She said that this
was the 3rd case of the disease reported in Northern Cape this year
[2010].

Blumberg revealed that another 67-year-old sheep farmer from Rouxville
in the Free State, who also has CCHF, was responding well to
treatment, and no secondary cases have been reported. "Congo fever is
not a common disease in Northern Cape, but it is not surprising when a
case is reported. Most of them occur in summer months," said Blumberg.
"Fortunately the doctors in the region are familiar with the disease
and its symptoms and always take safety precautions when a patient
shows symptoms of the disease at the hospital."

CCHF is caused by infection with a tick-borne virus (Nairovirus) [in
the family Bunyaviridae] which is acquired when a person is bitten by
a _Hyalomma_ tick. Symptoms include headache, high fever, back pain,
joint pain, stomach pain and vomiting. Those at risk of contracting it
are animal herders, livestock workers and workers at animal slaughter
houses. People who come into direct contact with Congo fever sufferers
are also at risk which is why patients suspected or confirmed are kept
in isolation.

Spokesperson for the provincial department of health Lulu Mxekezo said
the 64-year-old farmer was still in isolation at the Kimberly
Hospital. "Congo fever is highly infectious. People who came into
direct contact with the farmer are being closely monitored to see if
they present symptoms of the disease."

The disease is endemic in many countries in Africa, Europe and Asia,
and during 2001 cases or outbreaks were recorded in Kosovo, Albania,
Iran, Pakistan and South Africa.

The disease was 1st described in the Crimean Peninsula in 1944 and
given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognised
that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as
that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the Congo. The
linkage of the 2 place names resulted in the name for the disease and
the virus. CCHF is a severe disease in humans, with a high mortality
rate.

[There have been sporadic cases of CCHF in South Africa over the
years. Fortunately, the hospitals treating these patients have
effective barrier nursing facilities, so that there has been no
transmission within the hospitals associated with these 2 cases. From
1982 - 1992, 101 human CCHF cases were reported in South Africa (see
ProMED-mail archive 19980318.0515). As the above report notes, this
virus is very wide-spread.

ProMED's Jack Woodall was first author of the paper describing the
isolation of Congo virus, from the blood of a human in the then
Belgian Congo, now Zaire. CCHF virus infections are often asymptomatic
in sheep and cattle, posing a threat to abattoir workers in contact
with blood of viremic animals. There were cases associated with an
ostrich farm and abattoir in South Africa in 1996 (see ProMED-mail
archive 19961105.1861).
