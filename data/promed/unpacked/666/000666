[Although the serotype was not determined, given the bluetongue (BT) situation in that area, it is likely to be BT serotype 4. See ProMED-mail archives listed below.

[Turkey reported earlier BTV-4 outbreaks, namely in its European territory (see details below). The current, apparently "renewed" activity of the vector/virus, located at the northwestern Mediterranean coast of Turkey's Asian territory, is not surprising; it could have been anticipated in view of the multiple BTV-4 outbreaks reported earlier from the Greek Island Lesvos, facing the Turkish coast (see map in the Greek follow-up report No. 10 dated 20 Oct 2014 at http://tinyurl.com/ny9tj36.

The BTV-4 advance in the Balkans and adjacent counties, which started in April 2014 in south Greece (most probably windborne from North Africa), has already taken unusually wide dimensions and geographical expansion.

The following summarized accumulated data, derived from the most recent OIE reports of the affected countries, will illustrate the unusual dimensions of the 2014 epizootic (See http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary.

In the absence of vaccination, the virus continues its spread within the affected countries and beyond, now adding Croatia (most probably by the same virus strain) to the list of affected countries. It will be interesting to note when this event winds down with seasonal lowering temperatures and whether it proceeds on its march during the 2015 season. - Mod.AS/CRD
