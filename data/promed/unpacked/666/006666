Two Queen Creek women are getting preventative shots after being
exposed to a rabid bat after test results came back on Friday [19 Sep
2008]. One of the women found the bat that was discovered to have the
fatal disease after the tests results developed. The 2 women must now
take a series of 6 shots to prevent an infection.

County officials are warning people not to pick up or touch wild or
unfamiliar animals, especially those that appear sick. Bites or
scratches should be reported to health officials right away. Domestic
pets should be vaccinated. Rabies is fatal to people once symptoms
appear. It is common among Arizona's wild animal population.

[Bats remain the predominant source of human rabies virus infection
in the United States. Unlike in Europe and Central Asia, the strain
of rabies transmitted by bats in North America is related to the
classical canine form of rabies virus. Information on the species of
bat involved and confirmation of the genotype of the virus would be welcomed.
