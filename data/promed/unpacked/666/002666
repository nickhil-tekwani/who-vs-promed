Lettuce linked to food poisoning
--------------------------------
A salmonella outbreak has led health chiefs to identify an unexpected
source of the bug: lettuce. The bacteria claimed 144 food poisoning victims
throughout North East Lincolnshire in September 2004. Environmental health
officer Steve Mercer said: "We have pinpointed the source as lettuce, which
has never been regarded as a high risk food. I am not aware there has ever
before been an outbreak of this size associated with lettuce."
Mr Mercer believes contaminated lettuce is responsible for similar,
although smaller, outbreaks in Birmingham, Coventry, Northern Ireland, and
the Isle of Man in the past few weeks. He is writing to the Food Standards
Agency (FSA) to advise them to issue national guidance on the storage and
handling of lettuce, particularly in fast food outlets, where the North
East Lincolnshire cases all started.
"We would not want people to stop eating lettuce at home," he said. "The
problem seems to occur in certain fast food outlets, where lettuce is left
lying around on display in high temperatures. We now believe there may be
some multiplication of the bacteria in that environment."
The FSA and Health Protection Agency are currently assessing the cases. "We
have just had our final outbreak control meeting," said Mr Mercer, whose
team has been working round the clock for the last month [Sep 2004] to
identify the source of the illness. The last new case in this area was on
14 Sep 2004," he said, "so we have decided that this outbreak is over."

[Lettuce has been associated with the transmission of salmonellosis before.
For example: in 2000, outbreaks of _S. enterica_ serotype Typhimurium
definitive type (DT) 204 were linked to lettuce, one in England, where
there were 361 cases and one death, as well as in continental Europe and in
Iceland (cited in ProMED-mail 20010630.1248). In 2001, an outbreak of the
_S. enterica_ serotype Bovismorbificans (36 cases due to phage type 32) was
linked to iceberg lettuce in Australia (ProMED posting 20010901.2088). In
2001, the Newport serotype was linked to a salad, exact vehicle unknown, in
England (ProMED posting 20010630.1248). - Mod.LL]
