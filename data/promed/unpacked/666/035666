The Government is mobilising emergency support in Marakwet and Baringo Districts [both in the Rift Valley province] to counter rapid spread of peste des petits ruminants [PPR], a virulent goat and sheep disease.

The disease spread fast within days with Government intervention and action by the farmers to mitigate the outbreak coming in late.

[Marakwet District Veterinary Officer] Joseph Kiyeg, disclosed that at least 5000 animals predominantly goats and sheep were infected, with 50 per cent of them dying. He said farmers are recording new cases of the disease, traditionally confined to pastoralist areas, which is now spreading fast to neighbouring areas causing a slump in animal prices. "The outbreak has had a negative impact on the farmers who depend on livestock as their primary source of income year-in-year out," he explained.

Provincial Director of Veterinary Services, Nathan Songok, admits that the overall impact of the outbreak was devastating. He added that experts ruled out East Coast fever, which had first been linked to death of the several goats and sheep. "The results of samples collected by Regional Laboratory Veterinary Investigations team turned out positive for PPR," said Songok.

The outbreak, which hit hundreds of grazing fields, he disclosed, resulted in huge economic loses to the rural community.

The director said the outbreak was, however, under control adding that the Government conducted successful vaccination, which was still going on in the affected area.

He said the disease is believed to have originated from Ethiopia as a result of cross border grassing through the porous border with Turkana County. "We're seeing that in response to the threat of their animals contracting the disease, farmers are moving their animals away from infected villages to where so far there have been no disease outbreaks, which has been spreading the virus to healthy flocks of animals," explained Songok.

He said the vaccination exercise targets more than 50 000 livestock in the larger Marakwet District and called on stakeholders to support the initiative. Measures to control the outbreak led to the emergency slaughter of infected herds, restrictions imposed on community trade, and the indirect impact of the epidemic on the environment had a major cost on the community as a whole.

The officer pointed out that PPR vaccine provides protection for about 3 years for small livestock like goats. The director ordered restricting movement of livestock in the affected areas and warned the residents against consuming carcasses.

Areas in Marakwet East and Baringo East have now recorded new cases, whose immediate symptoms include, fever, coughing, and severe diarrhoea.

[According to serosurveys, PPR had already been circulating in Kenya and Uganda during the 1980's. For details and additional relevant commentary, please refer to ProMED-mail posting 20120817.1249510. The disease is thought to have spread into these countries from Sudan and Ethiopia.

PPR has been officially declared to the OIE as endemic in Kenya since 16 May 2007, and in Uganda since 10 Aug 2007.

Following its spread into Tanzania in early 2009, the FAO published in November 2010 a warning about the potential spread of PPR to Southern Africa, "posing a mortal threat to more than 50 million sheep and goats in 15 countries." (see ProMED-mail posting 20101103.3988). - Mod.AS
