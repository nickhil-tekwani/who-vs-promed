The culling of minks on 10 farms where infections with the coronavirus have been diagnosed, will take the whole week. Last [Sat 6 Jun 2020], all minks were killed on a farm in Deurne. On Sunday [7 Jun 2020], the animals were killed on 3 additional farms; the operation has been continued during [Mon 8 Jun 2020].

A total of 10 companies are involved and the NVWA [Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority] expects to complete the operation this week, according to a spokesman. The 1st company involved 1600 dams with an average of 5 young minks (puppies). The animals are killed on the farm and then transported to a rendering facility.

The NVWA will provide the details of the locations of the companies involved and the number of culled animals only after all the culling operations have been completed. The pelts of the animals are also destroyed and not used for clothing as is normally the case.

Everyone know what a farm with cows or pigs they looks like. There are plenty of them in Sint Anthonis. But a mink farm? It is not recognizable as such from the outside; no sign with colorful letters: 'mink breeding'. The animals are not visible.

The world of mink breeding is a closed one. Until about a week ago. Since then, they became frontline, because the minks can become a reservoir for the coronavirus. If the virus continues to circulate among the animals, there is a chance that people get infected through the mink. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture decided to clean up the infected farms. The clearing started on Saturday [6 Jun 2020] in Deurne, on Sunday [7 Jun 2020] the clearing teams also came to Landhorst.

A total of 3 companies have been infected in the municipality of Sint Anthonis; all in Landhorst, with one located on the Klotweg [road]. The Klotweg is a dusty dirt road where there has been a request for asphalting for some time. Three other companies seem to be located a little further away, in the outermost area of the municipality. For example, Landhorst probably has 4 and Oploo 3. [map at https://tinyurl.com/ycz493ku].

The CBS website states that there were a total of 128 mink farms in the Netherlands last year [2019], of which 13 are in the municipality of Sint Anthonis - since 2012, 'the mink capital' of the Netherlands. For comparison, in Mill and Sint Hubert there are 4 and in Gennep 3 mink farms.

But after a survey of some residents of Sint Anthonis, it soon becomes clear that nobody knows exactly where the farms are. Jeroen van Acquoij, chairman of the VVD party [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy], would like the municipality to publish this information. "It could be interesting information for residents if they want to stay away from these companies." Because of the privacy of the farms, the municipality will not do this; "to keep the public at a distance," says Van Acquoij.

In a further search for the mink breeders, 4 companies appear the telephone book. So there are still 9 missing. A phone call to the Dutch Federation for Noble Animal Farmers is of little use. They do not want to indicate how many breeding farms there are per municipality. "We will not give this information away without the permission of the owners," said chairman Wim Verhagen.

When asked whether this does not work for animal activists, he replies in the negative: "It is for privacy reasons."

The fear from animal activists seems to make little sense; the Animal Rights organization already has a list of breeding farms in Sint Anthonis. The spokesperson said that 16 companies are emerging.

But how can the activists have 16 companies on their list, while Statistics Netherlands have 13? "Because the industry has to stop in 2024, companies will disappear. Only we can't check if they are still a mink breeder. Some of the locations on our list may now have become goat farms. This can change within a month", said the spokesperson. So there are addresses on the list where there have been no mink for years.

Mink breeding is and will remain a closed world. In any case until [1 Jan 2024]. Then the last mink farms in Sint Anthonis must have disappeared.

Mink farms in the Netherlands have commenced a government-ordered culling of around 10 000 mink across the country over concerns that the animals infected with coronavirus could transmit the infection to humans, reports The Guardian.

According to the Netherlands Food & Wares Authority, mink infected with Covid-19 have been found on 10 Dutch farms. The authority's spokesperson Frederique Hermie said, "All mink breeding farms where there is an infection will be cleared, and farms, where there are no infections, won't be."

The World Health Organization, on [27 May 2020], had confirmed that it was possible that Dutch farmers had been infected by the mink, in what could be the 1st instance of animal-to-human transmission since the infection 1st originated in China.

The initial infection was reported in 2 farms near the city of Eindhoven, where the disease was discovered in April [2020] among mink that are bred for their valuable fur.

Dutch Agriculture Minister Carola Schouten said 2 workers likely contracted Covid-19 on a mink farm while stressing that the risk of further spread of the coronavirus from the mink to humans remains low.

The culling of mink involves farm workers in protective gear using gas on mink. The bodies of the mink will be sent to the disposal plant after which the farms will be disinfected.

Animal rights groups opposed to mink fur trade said the outbreak is another reason to close all farms. "We are calling for the 24 countries around the world that still allow mink farming to very rapidly evaluate the situation and evidence coming out of the Netherlands," said Claire Bass, executive director of the Humane Society International.

China, Denmark and Poland are the largest mink fur producers across the world. According to the Dutch Federation of Pelt Farmers, there are 140 mink farms in the Netherlands, exporting USD 146 million worth of fur every year.

In 2013, the Dutch Parliament had ordered the closure of all mink farms by 2024. Slovenia and Serbia have also passed legislation to ban all fur farming in the country. Countries like Norway and the UK have already banned mink farming for fur. The state of California in the US has banned the sale and manufacture of all fur products.

The Dutch mink are not the only animals to have been eliminated due to the coronavirus pandemic. Meat processing plants and hatcheries, across the world, have been forced to kill birds due to shut down and lack of business.

Several other animals have also been reportedly infected by Covid-19. On [4 Jun 2020], a dog was reportedly infected with coronavirus in the US. The disease has also been spotted in tigers, lions and cats. Also, early reports of animal-to-human transmission in China in February [2020] had led to cats and dogs being abandoned in Wuhan.
