The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today (16 Apr 2013) urged members of the public to maintain good environmental and personal hygiene to prevent _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b (Hib) infection.

The appeal was made after the CHP received a report of a fatal case of invasive Hib involving a 32-year-old man. The patient lived in a residential care home for the disabled in Yau Tsim Mong District. He presented with shortness of breath on 30 Mar 2013 and was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital on the same day. His condition deteriorated and he passed away on 31 Mar 2013. His blood culture grew _Haemophilus influenzae_ serotype b. His home contact is asymptomatic.

Hib is a germ that infrequently causes invasive disease in young children. The risk of invasive disease among older people is even lower. Invasive Hib disease commonly presents as infection of membranes covering the brain (meningitis), often accompanied by the germs entering the bloodstream. It may also affect other parts of the body, such as the lungs, the upper part of the throat, joints, and bones. Prompt antibiotic treatment is usually effective in curing the infection.

Hib infection has been a statutory notifiable disease since 14 Jul 2008. This is the 1st Hib case in 2013. One case was reported in each of the past 2 years.

[Since the advent of the conjugated type b _Haemophilus influenzae_ (Hib) vaccine, invasive infection due to this organism has almost disappeared in countries where the vaccine is part of routine immunization. The disease, however, remains problematic in much of the developing world. The vaccine is targeted for children as the peak age for infection was around 18 months. The other encapsulated serotypes of _H. influenzae_ have been reported, especially e and f, but have not come close to filling the void left by type b (1,2).

Invasive disease due to Hib has never been common in adults and decreased further after childhood immunization began, as has happened with pediatric pneumococcal vaccines. It is noted in the posting that the deceased lived in a home for the disabled but it is unclear in what way he was disabled. Secondary immunodeficiencies in adults can predispose to invasive Hib disease and low protective antibody levels against Hib has been reported in chronic renal failure, diabetes and multiple myeloma (3). Although routine vaccination or revaccination for Hib is not recommended for most adults, it is for individuals who are asplenic or hyposplenic because of the risk of postsplenectomy sepsis. The pneumococcus accounts for most of this infection, however, and did even before Hib immunization (4).
