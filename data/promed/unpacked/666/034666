An expert in the treatment of Lassa fever has disclosed that the disease has spread from 6 states of the country in 2009 to 23 in 2013.

Director of the Institute of Lassa Fever Research and Control at the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital [ISTH], Irrua, Edo State, Dr Daniel Asogun, said this on Thursday [26 Sep 2013] while speaking during the 2013 World Lassa Fever Day. He added that at least 93 persons have died from complications associated with Lassa fever between January 2011 and September 2013.

Of the number of deaths recorded, 17 people have so far died in 2013. Dr Asogun attributed the decline in the number of deaths to the awareness that is being created by the institute. He said that through the activities of the Institute of Lassa Fever Research and Control at the ISTH, fatal cases of Lassa fever at the hospital have dropped from between 60 to 80 per cent at the start of the new millennium to between 30 to 45 per cent. "Awareness of the infection is at a high level as is the index of suspicion among clinicians, a prerequisite for early diagnosis and favorable outcome," he pointed out.

He emphasised the need for the establishment of more diagnostic centres for the treatment of Lassa fever across the country so as to reduce the burden on the institute at ISTH, appealing to the federal government to pay more attention to the fight against the scourge through allocation of funds to build infrastructure as well as personnel.

The medical practitioner said that millions of Nigerians were unaware of the dangers posed by Lassa fever and, as a result, are not taking preventive measures to avoid the disease.
