The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 28 Dec 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 593, of which 545 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 360 deaths (312 confirmed and 48 probable) and 203 people healed.
- 21 suspected cases are under investigation.
Monitoring activities by the teams of Beni and Butembo were severely limited this Sat 29 Dec 2018. Thus, very few alerts could be investigated.
- 0 new confirmed cases detected due to paralysis of the response activities in Beni, Butembo, Komanda, and Mabalako.
- 1 new confirmed case death in Beni

News of the response
Activities of the response to Beni and Butembo
- The activities of the response resumed timidly on Sat 29 Dec 2018 in Beni and Butembo. The rehabilitation works of the Beni Transit Center are underway. The removal of the barricades placed on the roads by the demonstrators allowed the ambulances to circulate and to recover some sick patients. Laboratories in both cities were operational. No vaccination activity took place for the 3rd day in a row. Some dignified and safe burials were made in both health zones.

Vaccination
--------
- Interruption of immunization in Goma, Beni, Butembo, Katwa, Komanda, and Mabalako following protests by the population.

- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 53 613 people have been vaccinated. [The numbers are the same as the previous 2 days since no new vaccinations were able to be administered. - Mod.LK]

[See URL above to read report including table with cases by province and map of the history of Ebola.

Some control activities resumed on Sat 29 Dec 2018, but vaccinations continued to be suspended day 3. This is both good news and bad news. It is good that there was partial resumption of such activities as safe burials, laboratory testing, and operation of ambulance services, but contact tracing and vaccinations are critical to preventing the spread of the virus. It is completely unknown how many new cases there are, or how many contacts are going unfollowed. Once full activities resume, there is likely to be a large uptick in confirmed cases. Elections are Sunday [30 Dec 2018], and it is unknown what that will bring. The precipice that this outbreak is currently sitting on cannot be overstated. - Mod.LK]

- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 593, of which 545 are confirmed and 48 are probable. In total, there were 359 deaths (311 confirmed and 48 probable) and 203 people healed.

- 2 new confirmed cases in Katwa.
- 2 new confirmed case deaths, including 1 in Mabalako and 1 in Butembo.

News of the response

Activities of the response to Beni and Butembo
- The activities of the response to Beni and Butembo were still severely disrupted for the 2nd day in a row following the protests of the population. The teams were not able to deploy in both cities, but they were able to work remotely with local health workers who maintained minimal field activity.
- No vaccination activities took place in the health zones of Beni, Butembo, Katwa, and Mabalako.
- The community-based surveillance system and local health workers identified 18 alerts in Beni, of which 10 were investigated. Following these investigations, 4 new suspected cases were admitted to the CTE of Beni. As for the Butembo teams, they identified 11 alerts in Katwa and 8 in Kyondo, and one suspected case was transferred to Butembo CTE.
- In terms of care, the Beni Transit Center is not operational. The CTEs of Beni and Butembo were operational but with a small number of caregivers.
- No dignified and secure burial (EDS) has been performed in the health zones covered by the EDS teams in Beni and Butembo.
- The Beni laboratory was not functional today, but the Butembo laboratory was able to test the few samples received during the day.

Vandalism in Beni
- The Ministry of Health regrets that criminals took advantage of the elections-related protests in Beni to loot, vandalize, and destroy several public and private health centers in the city. Although the Ministry respects the right to protest by the population, this right cannot be used as an excuse to attack health facilities and health workers. In addition to being a crime, these serious acts unnecessarily expose the entire community to a greater spread of the Ebola outbreak.

Vaccination
-----------
- Interruption of immunization in Beni, Butembo, Katwa, and Mabalako.
- Continued immunization of primary care providers in the Goma Health Zone.
- Since vaccination began on 8 Aug 2018, 53 613 people have been vaccinated, including 19 363 in Beni [North Kivu], 10 761 in Katwa [North Kivu], 5875 in Butembo [North Kivu], 5377 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 2258 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1257 in Komanda [Ituri], 1009 in Oicha [North Kivu], 982 in Goma [North Kivu], 791 in Vuhovi [North Kivu], 750 in Masereka [North Kivu], 700 in Lubero [North Kivu], 659 in Kyondo [North Kivu], 599 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 394 in Musienene [North Kivu], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 167 in Nyankunde [Ituri], 70 in Biena [North Kivu], 63 in Alimbongo [North Kivu], 13 in Karisimbi [North Kivu] and 13 in Kisangani [Tshopo].
- The only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Fri 28 Dec 2018. Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola virus disease - Disease outbreak news: update
[WHO, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/28-december-2018-ebola-drc/en/

The Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO, and partners continue to respond to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). While communities in affected areas are generally supportive of the Ebola response, operations in some areas have been temporarily disrupted due to insecurity. On 27 Dec 2018, protests at government buildings in Beni spilled over to an Ebola transit centre, frightening people waiting for Ebola test results and the staff who were caring for them. Staff at the centre temporarily withdrew, and most suspected cases were transferred to a nearby treatment centre. WHO is concerned about the negative effects that the current insecurity is having on efforts to control the outbreak. After an intensification of field activities, marked improvements in controlling the outbreak were observed in many areas, including a recent decrease in cases in Beni. These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity that results in increased Ebola virus transmission. While maintaining focus on ending the outbreak and resuming normal operations as soon as possible, all response partners remain committed to ensuring the safety of staff. WHO continues to monitor the situation closely and will adapt their response as needed.

- Fri 28 Dec 2018. Statement on disruptions to the Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general [edited]
https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/28-12-2018-statement-on-disruptions-to-the-ebola-response-in-the-democratic-republic-of-the-congo

WHO and partners are continuing to respond to the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, despite a deterioration of the security situation since yesterday [Thu 27 Dec 2018] morning.

Yesterday [Thu 27 Dec 2018] our teams in Beni were unable to carry out critical field work, including vaccinations, contact tracing, and following up on alerts of potential new cases. Protests at government buildings in Beni spilled over to an Ebola transit centre, frightening people waiting for Ebola test results and the staff who were caring for them. Staff at the centre temporarily withdrew, and most suspected cases were transferred to a nearby treatment centre.

In Butembo, some alerts of potential cases were investigated, and confirmed cases were referred to treatment centres, but teams were unable to trace contacts or to conduct vaccinations. Response activities have not been interrupted in other affected areas.

We have reached a critical point in the Ebola response. After an intensification of field activities, we were seeing hopeful signs in many areas, including a recent decrease in cases in Beni. These gains could be lost if we suffer a period of prolonged insecurity, resulting in increased transmission. That would be a tragedy for the local population, who have already suffered too much.

Our teams in Beni and Butembo are doing everything possible to continue responding, despite the challenging security environment. For example, in Beni, contact tracing is being resumed with the support of local community relays, and WHO is supporting local health authorities to undertake other critical surveillance functions where possible.

In general, the communities in affected areas have been supportive of the response. We ask for everyone to protect health facilities and provide access for responders to the affected populations so that we can stop this outbreak. The population must also have safe access to transit and treatment centres that save lives and stop the spread of Ebola.

Working side by side with the Ministry of Health and our partners, our priority is to end the outbreak. We hope to return to full operations as soon as possible while remaining committed to ensuring the safety of all staff deployed. We cannot afford to take a step back at this critical point in the response.

[3] Response
- Fri 28 Dec 2018. Oxfam forced to suspend Ebola response in DR Congo following pre-election violence
[Relief Web, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/oxfam-forced-suspend-ebola-response-dr-congo-following-pre-election

Oxfam has been forced to suspend its work in the Ebola-ravaged areas of Beni and Butembo due to violent protests following the announcement that people in these areas won't be able to cast their votes for a new president, when the rest of country goes to the polls this Sunday [30 Dec 2018].

Raphael Mbuyi, Oxfam's acting country director in the DRC said: "This is an extremely worrying situation, as every time the Ebola response has been suspended before, we've seen a big spike in the number of new cases. This could mean Ebola spreading to even more people and potentially other countries in the region, putting many more lives at risk."

"However, it's not surprising that people who have had their votes taken away at the last minute are frustrated and going to the streets. These people deserve to have their say as well.

"All parties need to find a way for people who have been devastated by Ebola and have lived through decades of violent conflict to cast their vote.

"Whatever the outcome, there needs to be an end to the years of misery people in this country have had to endure. Just because elections are being held does not mean there will be peace."

[Oxfam has been serving the people of the DRC in a selfless manner. Their withdrawal from Beni and Butembo is a huge loss to the people of the country and the control effort, and I'm sure this decision was not made lightly. - Mod.LK]

- Sat 29 Dec 2018. American Being Monitored at Medical Center after Possible Ebola Exposure
[Nebraska Medicine, edited]
https://www.nebraskamed.com/biocontainment/ebola/american-to-be-monitored-at-medical-center-after-possible-ebola-exposure

An American providing medical assistance in the Democratic Republic of Congo recently experienced a possible exposure to the Ebola virus and is in Omaha for monitoring. This person has no Ebola symptoms but will be monitored closely. Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit would be activated and the person admitted.

"This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious," said Ted Cieslak MD, infectious diseases specialist with Nebraska Medicine and associate professor of Epidemiology in the University of Nebraska Medical Center College of Public Health. "Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Medicine/UNMC team is among the most qualified in the world to deal with them."

The individual was transported by private plane and automobile. Working with federal, state, and county public health officials, the individual will be monitored in a secure area not accessible by the public or any patients. Monitoring could last up to 2 weeks.

Nebraska Medicine treated 3 patients with Ebola in 2014. In 2015, several others were monitored after exposures, none of whom developed the disease. Nebraska Medical Center is home to one of the nation's few dedicated biocontainment units. In the years since the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa, infectious disease experts from Nebraska Medicine and its academic partner, the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC), have taken a leading role in training other healthcare workers across the USA and around the world in dealing with infectious diseases such as Ebola.

[The individual is in good hands in Nebraska. It is good news that no symptoms are evident. We have little information on the circumstances of the exposure and have to wonder whether the individual was vaccinated. We wish this person the best of luck. - Mod.LK
