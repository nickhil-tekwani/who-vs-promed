The Japanese National Committee for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
reported there are 43 patients
with CJD in Japan after implantation of cadaveric dura mater, and that no
case of new-variant CJD(nvCJD)1 has been detected. We report a case with
similar features to nvCJD.
At the age of 38 years, a Japanese woman received a cadaveric dural graft
(Lyodura, B Braun Melsungen
AG, Germany) after a clipping procedure of the right middle cerebral artery
aneurysm in September, 1985. In November, 1994, 110
months after the procedure, she became unsteady and had blurred vision. She
was admitted to hospital because of progressing ataxia. Examination
disclosed dementia, visual
disturbance, hyperreflexia, and cerebellar ataxia. Blood chemistry and
cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Brain computed tomography (CT) showed no
abnormal lesions. There was slow activities without periodic discharge on
her electroencephalogram>(EEG). After admission, she successively developed
dementia and myoclonus, and became akinetic and mute. Serial brain CT scans
revealed no abnormal findings, and serial EEGs showed diffuse slow activity
without periodic discharge. She died in March, 1995, 17 months after the
first symptoms.
The prion protein immunohistochemical staining of temporal cortex
Unicentric PrP plaque (arrow) surrounded by a zone of spongiform change,
the same appearance as florid plaque. Her brain weighed 1220 g and there
was little gross atrophic change. Histological examination showed
extensive spongiform degeneration in the cerebral neocortex, striatum,
thalamus, and cerebellar cortex, with associated astrocytosis and marked
neuronal loss. Immunohistochemically, prion protein (PrP) plaques of mostly
unicentric and rarely multicentric types were extensively distributed
throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Some of these plaques were florid
and surrounded by a zone of spongiform change (figure). Senile plaques
were not detected by immunohistochemical staining with amyloid beta-protein
antibody. The PrP gene analysis of her blood and brain tissue showed no
mutations with homozygosity, Met/Met, at codon 129.
Because she had received a dural graft and had a normal PrP gene, she was
thought to have iatrogenic CJD although there were numerous PrP plaques
including typical florid plaques. There have been two previous cases of CJD
with PrP plaques who had received a dural graft.2,3 These three cases had
a relatively long latency, no periodic discharge on EEG, and no gross brain
atrophy. The unusual features of this case are similar to the features of
nvCJD. Different patterns of immunoblotting have been reported between
cases with nvCJD and dura-graft cases.4,5 No western blotting was done in
this present case because the whole brain had been fixed by formalin. This
and the other two cases suggest that florid plaques are not specific to nvCJD.

This and the other two cases suggest that florid plaques are not specific
to nvCJD.
There is an older article about a french CJD patient with florid plaques.
She was a dura mater recipient too.
Kopp,N.; Streichenberger,N.; Deslys,J.P.; Laplanche,J.L.; Chazot,G.,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob-disease in a 52-year-old woman with florid plaques Lancet
1996; 348(N9036): 1239-40
A new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) has been recently
described.1,2 CJD has been reported in recipients of cadaveric human dura
mater grafts.3 We report a case which may be related to both conditions. A
52-year-old woman from Savoie was referred to a neurology department in
March, 1995, with progressively evolving impairment of walking. She had a
left sylvian artery aneurism operated on in 1984. Dura mater was used. We
have no further information about the dural graft. She had left amaurosis
since infancy, chronic hypertension, chronic alcohol and benzodiazepine
intoxication, and episodes of paranoid delusion. Examination showed
cerebellar ataxia, a normal electroencephalogram (EEG), a normal computed
tomographic (CT) scan, and probable ischaemic lacunae in the pons and
centrum semi-ovale on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 2 months later she
was unable to remain standing without aid and was confused. She had a
static and kinetic cerebellar syndrome, brisk deep tendon reflexes,
temporospatial disorientation, incoherent speech, 0.67 g/L protein in
cerebrospinal fluid, diffuse flattening of EEG, and seriously disturbed
liver function tests. After 3 months, laboratory investigations were
normal, except for elevated bismuth concentration in serum. EEG and MRI
were unchanged. A prefrontal cerebral biopsy was done. There were moderate
spongiform changes, discrete foci of astrocytosis, and a few plaques.
Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of proteinase K-1-resistant
pathological prion protein. PrNP genotyping revealed Met-Met homozygosity
at codon 129. No pathogenic mutation was found in the coding sequence.
After 5 months of deteriorating symptoms without myoclonia and without
characteristic EEG changes, the patient died. No necropsy was done.
Reviewing the case, we saw that the plaques were surrounded by a zone of
spongiform change, giving them a florid appearance (figure).
Immunocytochemistry with 3F4 antiPrP antibody showed strong staining of the
plaques. These observations raised the question of possible nvCJD. In
favour of this hypothesis are the onset with cerebellar signs without
dementia, the absence of characteristic EEG changes, florid plaques, the
absence of mutation and Met-Met homozygosity. Conversely age was
older--although a recent case of nvCJD has been described at age 51
(Ironside, personal communication). Clinical course was shorter than in the
published cases of nvCJD. The possibility of a link with dura mater is also
possible; although 11 years separate the onset from the graft, which is
longer than cases reported.3
It is impossible at present to give a definite diagnosis. However, florid
plaques seem to be the most striking histological finding in this patient
as in nvCJD and in macaques after bovine spongiform encephalopathy brain
inoculation.4
We thank S Badet, E Gros, and J W Ironside for their help.
