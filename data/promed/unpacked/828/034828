8/13/97 - The state of Maryland reopened the 4.5 miles of the lower Pocomoke
River which had been closed on August 7.
8/18/97 - The state of Maryland announced that 3 state workers had become
ill. Two of them had been taking water, sediment and fish samples on the
Pocomoke River since July and the third worker had been monitoring shellfish
beds for bacteria. Their symptoms included [short term] memory loss, cough,
sore throat and blistered and peeling skin on their hands and arms.
8/20/97 - 2.75 inches of rain fall in Maryland. It is thought by some that
heavy rain may wash extra nutrients down the rivers which may cause algal
blooms. State officials announced that they were expanding (by 3/4 of a mile)
an area of Pocomoke Sound which is off-limits to shell fishing due to unsafe
levels of fecal coliform bacteria. Officials said that this was in no way
related to the pfiesteria problem.
8/24/97 - More than 100,000 fish were found dead in a cove of Swans Gut creek
in Virginia, just over the Maryland line. Virginia officials determined that
the cause of death was insufficient oxygen and not pfiesteria. The state of
Maryland has already determined in their study of the Pocomoke River that
oxygen levels have remained normal.
8/25/97 - A small number of dead fish were found on the Virginia side of the
Pocomoke. Officials said that they would test them to see if they had been
killed by pfiesteria.
8/26/97 - There was a fish kill on the Virginia side of the mouth of the
Pocomoke River in Pocomoke Sound. Most of the 2000 fish which were found dead
had lesions typical of those caused by pfiesteria. Health officials in both
Accomack County, VA and Sumerset County, MD issed health advisories.
Environmentalists and others familiar with the region reported between 6000
and 20,000 fish had been killed. Sumerset County (MD) Health Officer Curtis
Dickson said that his department was now tracking 27 or 28 cases of illness
which may have been caused by pfiesteria. Researchers in North Carolina
announced that they were close to identifying the toxins produced by
pfiesteria.
8/27/97 - It was reported that there has been a 40% to 50% drop in the sale
of Maryland seafood. Less than 1% of Maryland seafood comes from the Pocomoke
River.
8/28/97 - The Maryland Department of Natural Resources asked the Governor to
restore a program to pay famers to plant cover crops to reduce the nutrients
which are washed down the river. The program was discontinued several years
ago. There have been reports from many different parts of the Chesapeake Bay
of fish with lesions but no fish kills. State officials pointed out that
lesions on fish may be caused by many microorganisms such as the bacteria
_Aeromonas hydrophilia_, which is known to cause lesions on rockfish. Richard
Lacouture, who has been studying microorganisms in bay waters for 13 years,
said that pfiesteria "looks almost identical to a non-toxic dinoflagellate
called _Gymnodinium_. There's a distinct possibility that over the years we
may have seen this organism over and over again in some of our samples and
simply referred to it as gymnodinium."
8/29/97 - Maryland Governor Glendenning announced at a news conference that
the state has closed a 7 mile stretch of the Pocomoke River. This was being
done because of new medical evidence that some people had been made ill by
pfiesteria in the Pocomoke River. Doctors at Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions found abnormal exchanges of brain chemicals in 7 of the 13
people who were taken ill after the fish kills. It was said that there was "a
very high probability" that the health problems were caused by pfiesteria.
Virginia officials then closed the Virginia portion of the Pocomoke. Governor
Glendenning said that there was no reason to panic and that he planned to eat
Chesapeake Bay seafood over the holiday weekend.
