Salmonella outbreak in London linked to delicatessen
Twenty-six cases of _Salmonella_ food poisoning have been confirmed among
186 cases of gastroenteritis associated with consumption of food items
produced by a delicatessen in north London and sold from over 20 outlets in
neighbouring districts and counties. Seven cases were admitted to hospital
and are recovering. The outbreak came to light on 6 October 1998. A court
order was obtained the next day to close down the delicatessen, whose name
(Oakwood Delicatessen) was made public so that the outlets it supplied
(mainly other delicatessens and sandwich bars) could be identified swiftly
and food it supplied withdrawn from sale. Public warnings about the
delicatessen and the food item implicated were issued, and the
investigation continues.
Early analysis of questionnaires and brief interviews from 56 cases shows
that about 90% of them recalled eating chopped chicken liver bought from or
supplied by Oakwood Delicatessen during the Jewish New Year and associated
festivals. Most of the cases became ill between 21 September and 7 October
1998. Isolates from 14 of the 26 laboratory confirmed cases have been
identified as _Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type (PT) 4 by the PHLS
Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens. Salmonellae have been identified in five
food items (including liver products) retrieved by environmental health
officers from delicatessens and the fridges of cases by the Food, Water and
Environment Laboratory (PHLS Thames). To date, four of these have been
identified as S. enteritidis PT 4. Inspection of Oakwood Delicatessen
showed that larger than usual quantities of food had been produced in
recent weeks. Hygiene standards were poor, products were inadequately
labelled, and comprehensive records were not kept.
The name of the delicatessen was made public in order to facilitate the
rapid identification of other food outlets and associated cases, in line
with recommendations made following a large outbreak of _Escherichia coli_
O157 infection in Scotland (1). Press releases named the suspected food
item and the geographical distribution of outlets (because of concern that
people might retain food items despite their short shelf life) and asked
for cases and outlets to come forward. No cases linked with the outbreak
are known to have become ill since the delicatessen was closed and food it
supplied was withdrawn.
