In the Urals, a citizen of Uzbekistan died from polio
-----------------------------------------------------
The Sverdlovsk Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Agency for Protection
of Consumer Rights and Human Welfare] confirmed a death from polio. As
reported on [7 Jun 2010] by a correspondent of the IA Regnum News
office, a citizen of Uzbekistan, who came to the Urals on 25 May 2010,
died yesterday [7 Jun 2010] in Yekaterinburg [formerly Sverdlovsk]. He
is suspected of having had acute poliomyelitis. [Specimens have been
sent to] the Moscow National Laboratory Center for diagnosis of
poliomyelitis. All citizens, with whom he had contact, were examined
by infectious disease [specialists] and vaccinated against polio.

Meanwhile, according to the spokesperson of the Rospotrebnadzor
Voropaeva, Moscow experts confirmed that the cause of death was polio.

Currently, there is an active vaccination of migrants, mostly citizens
of Tajikistan. According to representatives of Rospotrebnadzor, the
epidemiological situation of polio is under control.

Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Agency for Protection of Consumer
Rights and Human Welfare] has confirmed the 1st case of death from
poliomyelitis in the country in many years. A man died from polio in
Sverdlovsk district [now back to its original name Yekaterinburg].
Previously, it was reported that there was a suspected polio case from
Uzbekistan in a Yekaterinburg hospital. The laboratory tests in Moscow
confirmed poliomyelitis after his death.

[If the above story is correct, and the case with polio came to the
Urals from Uzbekistan on 25 May 2010, then it is highly likely that
this person was infected with the poliovirus prior to travel to
Russia. Obvious questions include the genetic profile of the
poliovirus involved -- including whether the poliovirus isolated is a
wild virus or a vaccine derived virus, the age of the patient and the
route of travel from Uzbekistan to Russia.

The most recent weekly case counts for confirmed wildpoliovirus (WPV)
cases since 1 Jan 2010 available on the polio eradication website, are
as of 1 Jun 2010 (see <http://www.polioeradication.org/>) and are
presented below:

Country: Year-to-date 2010 / Year-to-date 2009 / Total in 2009 / Date
of onset of most recent case
Tajikistan: 152 / 0 / 0 / 8 May 2010
Pakistan: 20 / 17 / 89 / 30 Apr 2010
Senegal: 18 / 0 / 0 / 30 Apr 2010
India: 21 / 59 / 741 / 29 Apr 2010
Mauritania: 5 / 0 / 13 / 28 Apr 2010
Nigeria: 3 / 288 / 388 / 18 Apr 2010
Angola: 5 / 6 / 29 / 14 Apr 2010
Afghanistan: 9 / 7 / 38 / 11 Apr 2010
Chad: 14 / 1 / 64 / 5 Apr 2010
Niger: 2 / 13 / 15 / 1 Apr 2010
Mali: 2 / 1 / 2 / 30 Mar 2010
Liberia: 1 / 0 / 11 / 3 Mar 2010
Sierra Leone: 1 / 0 / 11 / 28 Feb 2010
Nepal: 1 / 0 / 0 / 19 Feb 2010

According to the information provided on the website, there are still
367 AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases pending confirmation studies
in Tajikistan, so the number of confirmed cases may continue to rise
in the coming weeks. In addition, the website mentions that all cases
reported to date are from the west/south-west of the country, mostly
around Dushanbe City and the Khatlon and Kulyab zones of Kurgan-Tube
oblast [district].

Additional newswires mention that there have been 23 AFP cases
identified in Uzbekistan since the beginning of the year, but to date
none of these cases have been confirmed to be due to WPV (see
<http://www.regnum.ru/news/medicine/1280202.html>, in Russian).

A recent CDC travel alert to the region mentions that there have been
AFP cases in Uzbekistan close to the border with Tajikistan (see
<http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/content/outbreak-notice/polio-tajikistan-uzbekistan.aspx>.

More information on the above-mentioned polio fatality, including
epidemiologic and laboratory information as well as information on the
AFP surveillance results in Uzbekistan, would be greatly appreciated.

For the interactive HealthMap/ProMED map showing Yekaterinburg, in the
Urals, see
<http://healthmap.org/r/01ul>. If one moves the map around, one sees
the Yekaterinburg (on the map shown as Ekaterinburg) is near to the
border with Kazahkstan. To go overland from Uzbekistan to
Ekaterinburg, one would pass through Kazahkstan. - Mod.MPP]
