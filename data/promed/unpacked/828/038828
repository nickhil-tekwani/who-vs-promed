A mysterious disease that destroys the roots of cocoa trees has struck
at the heart of Cameroon's top growing region. Planters have asked for
government aid in stemming the spread of the ailment which has killed
hundreds of mature cocoa plants and adds to damage caused by an
outbreak of black pod in the southwest growing zone.

"About 300 cooperative union members have lost hundreds of plants,"
said Abraham Abong, Ekona Farmers Cooperative Union on the
northeastern slopes of Mount Cameroon, where the disease was 1st
spotted. "This is a disease we are not familiar with since we started
growing cocoa here." He said the new disease appears to rot the roots
of trees, causing the plants to dry out and die. Farmers were rushing
to harvest pods before their trees are killed, raising worries about
future output.

Cameroon's National Cocoa and Coffee Board said that government
experts would leave for the area to assess the impact of the disease.
Heavy downpours have soaked the southwest region for 3 months damaging
bean quality. The conditions have already triggered an outbreak of the
more common black pod disease [ProMED-mail post 20100825.3001].

Cameroon's government said controlling disease on cocoa and coffee
plantations was a key priority and announced it would distribute more
than USD 2 million of pesticides and insecticides to farmers.

[A number of mostly fungal pathogens are known to cause root rot and
dieback symptoms on cocoa similar to what is described in the report
above.

The current outbreak of black pod in the Southwest growing region of
Cameroon (ProMED-mail post 20100825.3001) is estimated to reduce the
2010 national yield by at least 10 percent. Black pod is one of the
primary diseases of cocoa worldwide, and in Africa, the fungus-like
pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated
with it. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated
approach.

Fungicides are currently provided by the Cameroon government to assist
in black pod control (see link below). If the new disease is caused by
a fungal pathogen, these fungicides may also have some benefits for
limiting its spread. However, the new disease is reported to affect
the roots and, therefore, may be soilborne and out of reach of foliar
sprays applied for black pod control. Reliable diagnosis of the
pathogen is essential for designing management strategies for the new
disease.
