Police have been denied access to evidence to investigate the arrival of a packet containing anthrax at the Prime Minister Secretariat and has been directed to keep away from the case, Dawn has learned.

But after handing over the evidence, including the powder, to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the Prime Minister Secretariat directed the agency to hush up the case, sources said. They said the sender of the powder was identified as an associate professor of Sindh University, Jamshoro, who was also the sister of a serving senior police officer of Sindh. She allegedly sent anthrax to Prime Minster Yousuf Raza Gilani on 18 Oct 2012 from the colony of the university. The registered (No 209) parcel also carried a stamp of the associate professor.

The secretariat has already conducted an investigation into the issue during which it was revealed that the teacher had gotten the anthrax from a laboratory of the university and sent it to the prime minister without any lethal motive. "The associate professor has some psychological problems," the sources added.

Although the PM Secretariat had approached the police and investigation agencies, now efforts are in progress to hush up the matter, the sources said. They said the senior police officer was close to some leaders of the ruling political party, who convinced the secretariat not to take any legal action against the sender.

A senior FIA officer, when contacted, categorically denied that the agency was investigating the matter or had gotten the evidence. However, he added, the agency's Sindh office might be working on it.

A senior officer of the capital police said they had been asked to keep away from the investigation. The police registered the case on the complaint of the PM Secretariat, but it has been kept away from the legal process necessary to investigate the case, he added.

The secretariat had also sent the sample of the powder to the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in Lahore, which confirmed the powder as anthrax.

The prime minister's spokesman, Akram Shaheedi, could not be contacted for comments, as his cellphone was switched off.

[Whatever the Sindh University Associate Professor was trying to say when sending a parcel containing anthrax spores to the Primer Minister's office, she got their attention, even if with embarrassment. In that there has been no legal retribution, we can safely assume that the spores were apathogenic and probably a common vaccine strain.

For those interested in what didn't happen since our last posting, here are 2 un-posted reports with details of what was done and not done in Islamabad:
