Pacific

Pacific region. 18 Jun 2018. WHO says 39 000 people have contracted dengue in the Pacific region over past 18 months. Since about the beginning of 2017, dengue serotype 2 has actually spread quite widely throughout the Pacific. But in fact 3 of the serotypes of dengue are co-circulating in the Pacific at the moment. We've had over 39 000 cases of dengue reported since that time, most of that has been dengue 2 but we have had some countries also reporting dengue type 1 and dengue type 4. So the outbreaks that we have had reported so us since 2017 have been from American Samoa, Fiji, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu in 2017. Some of those were actually continuing since 2016. We've also heard from Wallis and Futuna, which has experienced a dengue type 1 outbreak, while French Polynesia and New Caledonia have reported both intercurrent outbreaks of serotypes 1 and 2. Niue reported serotypes 2 and 4 and most recently you've heard of the dengue type 2 in Kiribati.
