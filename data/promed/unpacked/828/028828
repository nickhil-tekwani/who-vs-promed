On Friday 14 November, Dr.James Chin reported at least 41 CJD patients from
iatrogenic transmission, dura mater graft. Presently we have one such
patient (43-year-old) who initially was admitted to Department of
Psychiatry, Chulalongkorn University Hospital for the management of
depression and anxiety. She subsequently demonstrated dystonic movement of
the arms and legs and became mute within the following month. She was then
transferred to our Neurology ward and found to have startle response and
EEGs highly suggestive of CJD. In 1990, she had a spinal cord surgery,
removal of astrocytoma, and a dura mater graft, lyophilized product from a
German company. There were a total of more than 85 cases who had been
operated in this theatre with this same set of instruments [explained below
- Mod.ES. Moreover, it is not known how many such patients with dura
graft would develop this disease. I have reported this to Dr. Martin
Zeidler, WHO, Division of Emerging diseases, Geneva and alerted the
[relevant neurological and surgical societies. This patient is still
alive and DNA, CSF were saved for further examination (with informed
consent from the husband).
The regular protocol for routine sterilization [of neurosurgical
instruments is less rigid than that recommended for CJD in terms of
duration and pressure. [We have been advised by Dr. Martin Zeidler,
Division of Emerging Diseases, WHO [that despite the increasing of
temperature, pressure and duration of sterilization to the recommended
protocol for CJD, it remains unproven whether prions can be destroyed. The
standard procedure may be alright if the instruments are to be used for
operations other than in the central nervous system (this might include
eye). Therefore, it is advisable to discard the contaminated neurosurgical
instruments. Furthermore, we have to be careful regarding CSF pressure
manometers and three way [? in the process of lumbar puncture. There are
still many institutions that re use glass manometers and three way
[devices. After this case, I advise the hospital to use disposable sets
for lumbar puncture. This idea is also supported by WHO.
We are still trying to reach the 85 cases [to determine whether anyone
[has developed symptoms. I hope that this is just an overly cautious
attempt.
