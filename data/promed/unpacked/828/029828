No country wants to learn an _E. coli_ serotype not previously associated much with human illness is making people sick -- again. Especially when it wasn't ever known to be a resident strain in the country until 3 years ago. The new reality in the UK is the O55:H7 serotype, which scientists say is "a recent precursor to the virulent enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ O157: H7." It is _E. coli_ O157:H7 and 6 other Shiga-toxin producing _Escherichia coli_ serotypes known as O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145 that cause foodborne outbreaks.

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) declared those 6 strains as adulterants in meat. Previously, only _E. coli_ O157:H7 was on the adulterants list and targeted for verification testing. FSIS does not currently ban _E. coli_ O55, which is making people sick again in the UK. Public Health England (PHE), which has a short, but a somewhat rocky history of with O55, acknowledged late last week [week of Sun 24 Oct 2017] that it was again investigating "a confirmed case of _E. coli_ O55" and reported that case was "potentially linked" to other current _E. coli_ cases involving children.

PHE's 1st round with the rare _E. coli_ O55 strain was an outbreak in the Dorset area that began in July 2014 and caused 31 illnesses before it ended in November 2015. No source was found, and PHE was under fire for less-than transparent communications with the victims and their families. Parents of 2 of the child victims were especially critical, saying they were "disappointed and frustrated" by PHE's controlled the information. The UK's Food Standards Agency was also involved in the O55 outbreak investigation, which came to naught by the time it wrapped up its investigation in March 2016.

The case of a 19-year-old woman who 1st experienced symptoms of diarrhea and abdominal pain on [Sat 16 Sep 2017], confirms O55 is back. Her kidneys failed from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). She was last reported in critical condition at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London.

Since the 1st O55 outbreak, the UK's Animal Plant and Health Agency has developed a microscopic test for identifying the rare strain in both people and animals. The investigation of the 1st outbreak found that O55 also affected cats. The only experience PHE had with O55 before 2014 was when someone was infected with it during travel and returned to the UK. The outbreak strain for the 1st documented British outbreak of O55 had a Shiga toxin (Stx) subtype 2a associated with elevated risk of HUS, according to a report in the current issue of Eurosurveillance.

"The strain had not previously been isolated from humans or animals in England," according to the report. "The only epidemiological link was living in or having close links to two areas in Dorset." The outbreak in Dorset County, England, resulted in 13 HUS cases among the 31 total confirmed cases. The report authors, who were involved in the 2014-2015 investigation, say whole genome sequencing (WGS) shows those who became ill were infected with similar strains.

"There was little evidence to support the hypotheses of contaminated food items or drinking water or a specific recreational/environmental exposure," the authors wrote. "Given this, and the geographical clustering around 2 areas of Dorset, the 3rd hypothesis of a local endemic zoonotic infection acquired in humans from infected pets and directly from the environment seems the most likely cause of this outbreak."

[The following is an in press publication regarding the isolate's evolution:

Schutz K, Cowley LA, Shaaban S, et al: Evolutionary context of non-sorbitol-fermenting Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O55:H7. Emerg Infect Dis 2017; 23 (in press) https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/12/17-0628_article

The 1st outbreak of Shiga-toxin producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) O55:H7 [referred to as enterohemorrhagic _E. coli - EHEC here - Mod.LL] in the UK occurred in the county of Dorset, England, in July 2014 (1). Ultimately, 31 cases were linked to the outbreak, and 13 (42 percent) of those patients had hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Of the 13 with HUS, 8 (66 percent) had neurologic complications and 11 (90 percent) required prolonged treatment for kidney replacement. After enhanced epidemiologic surveillance and analysis of the patients' food, exposure, and travel histories, the only epidemiologic link identified was living in or having close links to Dorset County. Extensive microbiological investigations included testing of the environment, nondomestic animals, and household pets. Although no causal link was established, whole-genome sequencing and epidemiologic analyses were indicative of a local endemic zoonotic source (1).

Previous studies postulated that the common EHEC O157:H7 clone evolved from enteropathogenic _E. coli_ (EPEC) serotype O55:H7 (2,3). Evolutionary models predict the stepwise acquisition of a Shiga toxin (Stx)-encoding bacteriophage in the EPEC O55:H7 progenitor strain, followed by the substitution of the rfb locus encoding the somatic O55 antigen with that encoding the O157 antigen, the acquisition of the pO157 plasmid, loss of the ability to ferment sorbitol, and loss of the ability to produce β-glucuronidase (3-6). Analyses from more recent studies have indicated that the Stx-encoding phage is an unstable evolutionary marker, with frequent acquisition and loss occurring in EHEC O55:H7 and all 3 lineages of EHEC O157 throughout their evolutionary history (7,8).

EHEC O157:H7 has multiple genetic and phenotypic features that contribute to its pathogenicity or are used for detection and identification. The primary virulence factor defining the EHEC group is production of Stx1, Stx2, or both. The genes encoding the toxins, stx1 and stx2, are harbored on lambdoid prophage and are the targets of commercial and in-house diagnostic PCR assays (9). Both toxins can be divided into several subtypes, Stx1a-1d and Stx2a-2g (10). The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is a 35-kb pathogenicity island encoding a type III secretion system (T3SS) responsible for the attaching and effacing phenotype that facilitates successful colonization of the human gut (11). The inability to ferment sorbitol or to produce β-glucuronidase differentiates EHEC O157 from ≈90 percent of other gastrointestinal bacteria (5,12). These characteristics, along with resistance to tellurite, facilitate the detection and identification of EHEC O157:H7 on selective media. The pO157 plasmid encodes multiple putative virulence factors, including enterohemolysin (ehxA) and an adhesin (toxB) (13).

The EHEC O55:H7 Dorset outbreak strain shared certain characteristics with the EHEC O157:H7 clone. Initial PCRs detected the presence of stx2 and the intimin gene eae, a marker for _E. coli_ attaching and effacing phenotype; non-sorbitol-fermenting colonies of EHEC O55 were identified after culture on sorbitol MacConkey agar (1,9). However, unlike the EHEC O157 clone, the EHEC O55 Dorset outbreak strain exhibited β-glucuronidase activity and was sensitive to tellurite. Laboratory records held at the Gastrointestinal Bacterial Reference Unit of Public Health England showed that this highly pathogenic strain had not previously been isolated from humans or animals in the United Kingdom. Our goal with this study was to identify the genetic determinants responsible for the phenotypic characteristics of the EHEC O55:H7 Dorset outbreak strain and to explore the strain's evolutionary history.

Discussion
----------
In the UK, EHEC is regarded as a substantial threat to public health, and enhanced surveillance systems are in place (32). In England, HUS developed in ≈5 percent of symptomatic EHEC O157:H7 patients (33), notably less than the 42 percent of patients in whom HUS developed during the STEC O55:H7 outbreak described in this study. The Dorset outbreak strain was closely related to the common EHEC O157:H7 clone and shared several characteristics, most notably the presence of phage-encoded stx2a. Stx2a is associated with more severe symptoms, including the development of HUS, and it is probably the key virulence factor causing the high proportion of HUS cases in this outbreak (10). Of additional concern was the inability to detect the outbreak strain at the local hospital level by using the standard microbiology investigation method, cefixime and tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar, because of this strain's sensitivity to tellurite.

A previously published stepwise evolutionary model showed the acquisition of stx2 by a strain of EPEC O55:H7, resulting in emergence of a strain of STEC O55:H7, which was β-glucuronidase positive and sorbitol positive, closely related but ancestral to EHEC O157:H7, which was β-glucuronidase positive and sorbitol positive (34). The loss of the sorbitol-positive phenotype in EHEC O157:H7 was followed by the loss of β-glucuronidase expression, resulting in the common EHEC O157 sorbitol-negative β-glucuronidase-negative clone. The evolutionary history of the Dorset outbreak strain begins with the EPEC O55:H7 progenitor strain described previously (6) (Figure 3). Subsequent acquisition of an Stx2a-encoding phage was confirmed by detection of EHEC O55:H7 β-glucuronidase-positive sorbitol-positive isolates in Ireland in 2012 (Figure 3). The loss of the sorbitol-positive phenotype mirrored the genetic events proposed to have occurred in the evolution of EHEC O157, albeit by an alternative mechanism.

The parallel, convergent evolutionary history of EHEC O157:H7 and EHEC O55:H7 may indicate a common driver in the evolutionary process. Adaptation to a new niche may be accompanied by modification of gene expression because genes no longer required for, or incompatible with, the variation in lifestyle are selectively inactivated by point mutation, insertion, or deletion (35). Loss of the sorbitol-positive phenotype may coincide with the successful colonization of a new animal host or the ability to transmit more effectively between animal hosts without the need to survive in the environment for long periods (28,36).

The detection of the EHEC O55:H7 sorbitol-negative strain in patients in Ireland before the outbreak in Dorset led to speculation that ruminants (most likely cattle or sheep) on the island of Ireland were the source of the outbreak strain (1). Transmission between Ireland and Dorset may have occurred via movement of persons, livestock, or a secondary vector such as migratory birds (37). The finding that the Stx2a-encoding phage has a high level of similarity to Stx2a-encoding phage found in a previously described sublineage of EHEC O157 PT32 geographically linked to Ireland may provide further evidence of the origin of this strain (17,29). Phages from EHEC O157 may be exchanged with other phages from serotypes of _E. coli_ in the gut of the ruminant host or in the environment. Analysis and comparison of phage sequences to provide clues regarding the origin of a strain of EHEC is a novel approach to outbreak investigation; additional studies are required to evaluate the utility of the approach. Further work will be hampered by the lack of available sequences of the Stx-encoding phage and the difficulties with assembling the sequences because of the inability of short-read sequencing to resolve the large number of repetitive and paralogous features characteristic of the prophage.

The EHEC O55:H7 Dorset outbreak strain described in this study shared characteristics with the common EHEC O157:H7 clone, specifically the acquisition of an Stx2a-encoding phage and the sorbitol-negative phenotype. Key differences between the 2 strains include the rfb gene cluster, plasmid content, β-glucuronidase phenotype, and the absence of the ter gene cluster in the EHEC O55:H7 outbreak strain. Despite these differences, this study provides evidence of parallel, convergent evolution of EHEC O157:H7 and EHEC O55:H7, involving multiple acquisitions of Stx-encoding phages and loss of the ability to ferment sorbitol. Previous studies have shown a clear association with EHEC harboring stx2a and progression to HUS (10). Acquisition of the Stx2a-encoding phage seems to explain the emergence of EHEC O157:H7 as a clinically significant pathogen; in contrast to the acquisition of stx2c, evidence suggests that after Stx2a-encoding phage is integrated in a population, it tends to be maintained and may be associated with higher excretions levels in cattle (29,36). As such, the emergence of EHEC O55:H7 harboring stx2a is of public health concern. - Mod.LL
