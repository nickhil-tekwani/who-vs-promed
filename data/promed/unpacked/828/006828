[Peter sent these thoughts to me, not to ProMED-mail. We had received some
descriptions of hectic situations in emergency rooms and suggested methods
for treating patients and I just didn't see that they were much different
one from another. We very much appreciate the time taken by some obviously
key people who obviously are not getting much sleep themselves. On the
other hand, Peter's comments, below, for which I have obtained his
permission to post, seem to begin a dialogue. I am not at all certain that
we will be in a position to post a flood of responses to these comments,
should they arrive, but at least we will have stirred the pot, which I see
as a Prime Directive, although no one has ever told me that. - Mod.CHC
Although there have been recent posts on ProMED-mail about a "new
erythromycin sensitive respiratory illness" plaguing Los Angeles, we (well,
actually my wife Maria Appleman, who is the microbiologist in charge of the
LA County Hospital labs) have been isolating many strains of influenza A
from these patients. Part of my work is to run a walk-in clinic on Mondays
for our HIV/AIDS patients and it's been my experience that they are the
sentinels for community-acquired respiratory diseases. Two [years ago I
saw a lot of pertussis but this year it looks like typical influenza.
The isolates have not been subtyped yet, but I would not be surprised to
learn that we have A/Sydney, as many people have had two discrete bouts of
influenza-like illness, one in October/November and now again in
December/January. Among eleven patients I saw last Monday with recent and
fairly classic symptoms, none required admission to the hospital. So, even
among the immunocompromised, it appears to have the usual virulence.
I've been a little surprised by the lack of preparation for an influenza
epidemic/pandemic. Although the H5N1 strain does not appear to be spreading
very efficiently [or at all - Mod.CHC person-to-person, it seems
reasonable to me that "passage" through humans could be just as effective
in increasing virulence as recombination in pigs.
As I wrote to Jim Chin [CDPC-mail and told Nancy Cox [CDC, the public's
interest in this story could be used to increase acceptance of influenza
and pneumococcal vaccines, particularly by health care workers (HCWs), who
are notoriously under-immunized and likely to transmit influenza to their
patients.
Secondly, we need a policy on distribution and use of
amantadine/rimantadine. Vaccines take some time to produce.
Amantadine/rimantadine have a three-year shelf-life and of course have
other uses. We need to assure that there will be antivirals available,
particularly for HCWs in emergency room and outpatient clinic. From past
experience, if there is an outbreak that carries a significant risk of
death, HCWs won't come to work. They will be panicked by the press reports
like everyone else. The following was our lesson from AIDS: Only if [health
care workers believe they have a reasonable method to prevent infection
will they continue to work during an outbreak that carries significant risk
of mortality to them. Perhaps, more likely and so more important, real
measures to prevent influenza in HCWs during an outbreak might reduce
transmission to patients, where mortality is much more likely.
