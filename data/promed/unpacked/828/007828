[With the continuing decline of the number of cases in the human
population of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease -- abbreviated
previously as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail -- it has been
decided to broaden the scope of the occasional ProMED-mail updates to
include other prion-related diseases. In addition to vCJD, data
onother forms of CJD: sporadic, iatrogenic, familial, and GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease) are included also since they
may have some relevance to the incidence and etiology of vCJD. -

The number of deaths due to definite or probable vCJD as of 2 May
2011 remains 171. A total of 4 definite/probable patients remain
alive, so the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases remains
175.

The overall picture remains consistent with the view that the vCJD
outbreak in the UK is in decline, albeit now with a pronounced tail.
The 1st cases were observed in 1995, and the peak number of deaths was
28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, 9
in 2004, 5 in 2005, 5 in 2006, 5 in 2007, 1 in 2008, 3 in 2009, 3 in
2010, and one so far in 2011.

Totals for all types of CJD cases in the UK in the year 2011
-----------
During 2011 so far [as of 2 May 2011], there have been 51 referrals,
18 fatal cases of sporadic CJD, one case of GSS, 2 cases of familial
CJD, one case of vCJD and none of iatrogenic CJD.

Since records began in 1990, there have been 2784 referrals, 1228
fatal cases of sporadic CJD, 171 cases of vCJD, 84 cases of familial
CJD, 65 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 44 cases of GSS.

Cumulative data 1 Jan to 28 Feb 2011, the 12 months of 2010, and
overall since 1996 [unchanged since previous update]
-----------
During the 1st 2 months of 2011, there have been 52 referrals, 28 of
whom were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 10 cases of
sporadic CJD, 3 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic CJD or vCJD.

During the 12 months of 2010, there were 403 referrals, of whom 251
were classified as prion disease cases, comprising 208 cases of
sporadic CJD, 40 of familial CJD, and none of iatrogenic or vCJD.

Overall, 3952 referrals have been examined since screening began in
1996 or thereabouts, with diagnoses pending in 13 cases or
inconclusive in 18 cases, a measure of the difficulty in achieving
unequivocal diagnoses.

During this 16 year period, a total of 2329 prion disease cases have
been screened, a figure which includes 18 (15 during 2010) cases with
type determination pending, but in which a diagnosis of vCJD has been
excluded. Overall, there were 1965 cases of sporadic CJD, 338 cases of
familial CJD, 5 cases of iatrogenic CJD, and 3 cases of vCJD. The 3
cases of vCJD recorded in the USA have been attributed to infection
occurring in the United Kingdom in 2 cases and in Saudi Arabia in the
other.

[4] Canada - blood donation restriction
Date: Fri 15 Apr 2011

Canadian health officials have confirmed the country's 2nd-ever case
of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [vCJD], the rare human form of
the so-called "mad cow disease" usually caused by eating infected
beef. The head of the federal agency that monitors the disease says
the man, an Ontario resident, is believed to have been infected in
Saudi Arabia and that the chance he was infected by eating Canadian
beef is "just about zero." "It's so low so as not to be a concern for
the safety of Canadian beef," said Dr. Michael Coulthart, director of
the Canadian Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease surveillance system at the
national microbiology lab in Winnipeg.

Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is the human form of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. It is most commonly caused by
eating meat from BSE-infected cattle, though there have also been
documented transmissions through blood transfusions and the potential
for infection through medical and dental tools. Only one other person
in Canada has been confirmed to have had the human form of mad cow
disease, a Saskatchewan man who died in 2002.

Information released by Health Canada in both Arabic and English says
the Ontario man began experiencing symptoms just prior to immigrating
to Canada from Saudi Arabia in 2010. Health Canada says there is no
indication the man ever donated blood or received a blood transfusion
in Canada, or underwent any surgical procedures outside the
government's infection control guidelines. The statement says the risk
to the Canadian blood supply is considered to be "very low."

Despite a relatively small number of human deaths, the emergence of
mad cow disease in animals and humans in the 1980s and 1990s had a
huge impact around the world, prompting the large scale culling of
animal herds, leading to massive changes in animal feeding guidelines
and devastating cattle operations and trade globally. Canada's cattle
herd was believed to be BSE-free until May 2003, when the 1st case of
mad cow disease was confirmed in a dairy cow on a farm in northern
Alberta. The discovery led to strict bans on the import of Canadian
beef and cattle in the United States, rocking Canada's agricultural
industry. Outbreaks of the human form of the disease also led to
changes in blood donor regulations in a number of countries, including
Canada.

The discovery of the new case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob [disease]
in Canada last month [Marh 2011] prompted an almost immediate change
in the country's blood donation policies, which now restrict anyone
who was in Saudi Arabia for 6 months or longer in the period from 1980
to 1996 from giving blood. The restriction previously related only to
the United Kingdom, France and Western Europe.

The disease 1st emerged in humans in the mid-1990s and peaked in 2000
in the U.K., where it has been the most prevalent. Coulthart says the
discovery of a new case in Canada remains significant. "It's one of
those cases where long-term vigilance is going to be required to
definitively deal with the issue," he said. "Every case is potentially
significant, and you don't want to miss any. Any individual case can
have large implications, potentially, and you want to know as much as
you can about the origins of each case that does occur, whenever it
occurs. So, that's one reason to stay vigilant."

Because of the disease's long incubation period, Coulthart says there
are also concerns about the "carrier effect," where people could have
the disease for years -- even decades -- without knowing it, then pass
it on through blood transfusions or medical or dental tools. In that
scenario, he says there could be a resurgence in the human form of the
disease in the future, particularly given that the prion agent of the
disease is extremely resistant to normal methods of decontamination
and disinfection.

[5] Prion infection "Fast & furious"
Date: Tue 19 Apr 2011

Releases [edited]
http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC007873


Scientists funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) have shown
that one minute of exposure to infecting prions is enough to begin the
chain reaction of events which lead to prion disease in the brain,
causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human form of mad cow disease,
far quicker than previously estimated. Understanding more about the
1st few minutes and the unexpected speed of prion infection in cells
demonstrated in this study may help to explain the aggressive
progression of prion diseases observed in the body and why the whole
nervous system can become affected within a few weeks.

Previous studies on cultured cells had suggested that prion protein
misfolding, a process which indicates the beginnings of prion
infection, appears several days after exposure to infectious material.
The authors of this study, published in Nature Communications have
developed a new system where a tagged prion protein is introduced into
cells in culture, allowing for the 1st time newly converted prion
protein to be detected. With this system, they have shown that
misfolded prion protein can accumulate in under 2 hours, that only one
minute of exposure is enough to convert a normal prion protein to its
infectious form, and that this occurs 1st on the cell surface. The
work was carried out at University College London (UCL) Institute of
Neurology.

Prof Sarah Tabrizi, based at the UCL Institute of Neurology, who led
the study says: "These findings provide new insights into prion
infection by revealing how the infectious form of the protein can
spread so quickly across the brain, and may partly explain why the
whole nervous system can become affected within a few weeks. Little
has been understood about the earliest events and the fundamental
changes which take place when cells in the brain are exposed to
prions, and hopefully this study will inform further research that
goes some way to mitigating the damage caused by devastating prion
infections."

An accompanying commentary "The Fast and the Furious" is also
published today in Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology (Title:
Prions: The fast and the furious. Author David R. Reference: Nat Rev
Mol Cell Biol 2011 May; 12(5):278-9).

Nature press release
----------------
A cell system to detect newly synthesised prions in the laboratory is
reported in this week's Nature Communications and shows that prion
proteins rapidly infect cells. These findings may open new
opportunities for investigating the synthesis and pathological role of
prion proteins. Neurodegenerative prion diseases, such as
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), are characterised by misfolded prion
proteins; however, this has been difficult to study in a laboratory
setting because the proteins used to inoculate the cell cultures are
identical to those that are expressed by the host cell. Sarah Tabrizi
and colleagues have developed a new system where a tagged prion
protein is introduced into cells in culture. This allows the study of
the early features of prion infection. Using this, the team shows
that, in the laboratory, prions infect cells within one minute of
exposure and that the cell plasma membrane is the site of the
conversion of prion proteins into the misfolded form.

Annual Report 2009 [edited]
http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/report18.pdf


18th Annual Report 2009 - Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance in
the the UK
--------------------------------
[The full text and figures of the latest annual report of the NCJDRSU
covering the period 1990-2009 (published 11 Mar 2011) can be accessed
at: http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/report18.pdf. The following is the
Summary of this Report. Interested readers should access the original
document for further information - Mod.CP]

Summary
-------
The national surveillance programme for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in the UK was initiated in May 1990. In 1999, the National CJD
Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) became a WHO Collaborative Centre for
Reference and Research on the surveillance and epidemiology of human
transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). In September 2001,
the National Care Team was formed, which currently comprises 2 care
coordinators and a secretary. It is based within the NCJDSU and was
formed in response to concerns regarding the care of CJD patients.

The information provided in this Eighteenth Annual Report continues
to indicate that the number of sporadic cases remains relatively
stable (the data for 2009 may still be incomplete). Detailed clinical
and epidemiological information has been obtained for the great
majority of patients. Referrals, having been fewer between 2004 and
2007, increased in 2008, back towards pre-2004 levels. 2008 saw the
highest mortality rate from sporadic CJD in the UK (1.43 per million
per year) since 1985; a rate which is comparable with other European
countries. The mortality rate for 2009 is 1.27 (although data for 2009
may still be incomplete). Although the post mortem rate for patients
with suspected CJD has declined, in line with general autopsy rates in
the UK, it remains relatively high (around 60 percent). The number of
brain specimens examined for sporadic CJD in the neuropathology
laboratory remained similar to 2008, with 29 samples in 2009 compared
with 28 in 2008.

In 1990-2009 average annual mortality rates from sporadic CJD in
England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were, respectively,
0.95, 1.13, 1.01 and 0.59/million/year. The differences between these
rates are not statistically significant (p=0.4). The mortality rates
from sporadic CJD in the UK are comparable to those observed in most
other European countries and elsewhere in the world, including
countries that are free of BSE. The highest and lowest mortality rates
from sporadic CJD were observed in the South West (SMR=119) and
Northern Ireland (SMR=72), respectively. The variation in the observed
mortality rates between the different regions within the UK is not
statistically significant (p=0.7).

Up to the end of the 1st quarter of 2010, 172 cases of definite or
probable vCJD had been identified in the UK (117 definite, 51 probable
who did not undergo post mortem and 4 probable cases still alive).

The clinical, neuropathological and epidemiological features of the
cases of vCJD are remarkably uniform and consistent with previous
descriptions. Risk factors for the development of vCJD include age,
residence in the UK and methionine homozygosity at codon 129 of the
prion protein gene; all 152 clinically affected definite and probable
cases of vCJD with available genetic analysis have been methionine
homozygotes.

Analysis of vCJD diagnoses and deaths from January 1994 to December
2009 indicates that a peak has passed. While this is an encouraging
finding, the incidence of vCJD may increase again, particularly if
different genetic subgroups with longer incubation periods exist.

The identification of an individual of the PRNP-129 MV genotype as a
possible case of vCJD and, in a separate case, disease-related prion
protein in the spleen of a clinically unaffected blood recipient
(reported in 2004), are consistent with such a hypothesis. These
cases, along with the report of the prevalence of abnormal prion
protein in the large study of appendix and tonsil tissues (2 of the
positive specimens from VV individuals), suggest the possibility of a
greater number of preclinical or subclinical cases in the population
than might be indicated by the present numbers of confirmed clinical
cases.

The incidence of vCJD is higher in the north of Britain than in the
south, and the only statistically significant geographic cluster of
vCJD cases in the UK remains that seen in Leicestershire (5 cases
occurring between 1996 and 1999).

The NCJDSU continues to collaborate with the Health Protection Agency
Centre for Infections and Health Protection Scotland in relation to a
range of activities, including testing of pathological specimens from
the National Anonymous Tonsil Archive study through input into the
development and implementation of public health policy, for example,
in relation to the follow up of those identified as at increased risk
of CJD.

The activities of the NCJDSU are strengthened by collaboration with
other surveillance projects, including the Transfusion Medicine
Epidemiology Review and the study of Progressive Intellectual and
Neurological Deterioration in Children. The collaboration of our
colleagues in these projects is greatly appreciated; the effectiveness
of this collaboration allowed the identification in 2003 of a case of
vCJD associated with blood transfusion and the identification in 2004
of disease-related PrP in the spleen of a recipient of blood donated
by someone incubating vCJD.

A study has been undertaken to investigate dental treatment as a
possible risk factor for vCJD. The study (funded by the Department of
Health, UK) attempted to trace and examine the dental records of 162
vCJD cases and 610 general population controls resident in England,
Wales and Scotland. A report of the findings is currently being
reviewed by the Department of Health, and a paper is in preparation
for publication.

The recently described form of prion disease termed Protease
Sensitive Prionopathy is of uncertain nosological significance but is
presently considered a form of sporadic prion disease, alongside
sporadic CJD. The NCJDSU has identified a UK instance of this disease
in 2008, a further case this year [2011] and is currently reviewing
its archives to see whether any other instances can be identified.

The success of the National CJD Surveillance Unit continues to depend
on the extraordinary level of cooperation from the neurology and
neuropathology communities and other medical and paramedical staff
throughout the UK. Ongoing support is provided by the Infectious
Disease Epidemiology Unit, London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine. We are also particularly grateful to the relatives of
patients for their collaboration.
