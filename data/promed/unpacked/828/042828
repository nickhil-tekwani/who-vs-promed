Aid agency: worst anthrax outbreak looming
------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the deadly cattle-born disease anthrax is threatening
to turn into Zimbabwe's worst yet, compounding a 7-week national
epidemic of cholera, an international aid agency warned Monday [1 Dec
2008]. The British-based Save the Children Fund said health workers
had reported 32 cases of human infection and 3 deaths of people who
had probably been eating meat from the carcasses of cattle infected
with the disease in remote northwest Zimbabwe.

The disease had already killed 150 livestock, 2 elephants, 70 hippo,
and 50 buffalo. It threatened to wipe out 60 000 cattle in the
region, it said.

Spokeswoman Rachel Pounds said the outbreak could be the worst since
the country's civil war for black majority rule that preceded
independence in 1980, when hundreds of people were reported to have
died. There was a risk that the disease, which is usually fatal if
not treated with heavy antibiotic doses, could spread out of the
Binga district in the Zambezi river valley, into the tourist town of
Victoria Falls and across the border into neighbouring Zambia, she
said.

Traders had been seen trucking potentially infected meat from Binga
to Victoria Falls.

"Many families in the Zambezi Valley are so hungry they are taking
meat from the carcasses of their animals, even if they know it's
diseased, and feeding it to their children," Pounds said. "Families
no longer have choice here. Even if they know they shouldn't sell
their livestock, it's often the only way of making money to feed
themselves."

Zimbabwe is in the grip of a deadly complex of crises, with a
collapsing economy, famine with nearly 4 million people facing
starvation, the shut-down of infrastructure including hospitals and
schools, and the failure of services like water, electricity,
sewerage disposal, and refuse collection. "Quarantines (against the
movement of potentially infected meat) may be in place, but
Zimbabwe's systems have collapsed," Pounds said.

[Binga is located on the lower southeastern shore of Lake Kariba; see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/zimbabwe_rel_2002.pdf>.

This report appears to be another take on the outbreak originally
reported in Lupane District, Matabeleland North, on 14 Nov 2008 (see
ProMED-mail 20081116.3621). From what is implied it would now appear
that the epidemic has spread north to the Zambezi Valley -- why else
would meat from Binga be a risk -- reinforced by the reports of hippo
and buffalo deaths.

Up until now the Zambezi press has been holding to only 6 human cases
with wobbles. Now we have 32 human clinical cases with 3 deaths. With
the collapse of the medical services anything unfortunately could be
happening. - Mod.MHJ]
