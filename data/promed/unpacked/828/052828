A 49-year-old, previously healthy male from Hetauda (Makwanpur district, [Narayani zone]) presented with hydrophobia, aerophobia, AND difficulty in swallowing and has been admitted (on 13 Apr 2015) to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). He later developed numbness and muscle weakness of the left leg.

An unprovoked stray dog had bitten the dorsal surface of both his hands 4 weeks back, but [the man] did not receive either anti-rabies vaccine (ARV) or rabies immunoglobulin (RIG), despite his family's suggestion to get rabies vaccination. Other patients (more than 4 patients) who were bitten by the same street dog have received ARVs following this incident.

No paralytic rabies case has been described previously in Nepal, perhaps due to under-reported/misdiagnosed or not being included in the differential diagnosis. This case shows an overlapping clinical form of furious and paralytic rabies (dumb). The patient left hospital against medical advice on 14 Apr 2015. A total of 9 patients (including this case) have died from rabies in the past 10 months alone (since June 2014).

RIG is not readily available or administered throughout the country; thus this availability refers to STIDH for the management of category III bites, although it is not free of cost or provided by the government. A few weeks ago, there had been a shortage of RIG for more than 6 months in Nepal. The government sometimes does not provide ARVs despite recommendations from physicians (which are on a case-by-case basis). No national rabies management guidelines are available in Nepal.

Poor knowledge (among both health care workers and the general public), self negligence regarding wound treatment, inadequate supplies of RIG and ARVs, unknown post vaccination titre, and a lack of political commitment are major challenges to eliminating rabies disease in Nepal.

[Our thanks to Dr Pun for his excellent description of this recent case of human rabies. But yet again it points up a One Health problem: unless one can effectively control canine rabies, one will see an ongoing stream of human cases. This control is more cost effective than struggling with the retroactive treatment of exposed individual humans, which is collectively not cheap. Though demanding in organisation, the vaccination and marking of vaccinated dogs is straightforward and within 3 years can demonstrate its success. Starting with known high-risk areas it is demonstrably cost effective, and this will foster public awareness and government financial support. And then regional programmes are possible.
