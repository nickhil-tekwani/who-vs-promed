New bird flu outbreak in Thailand delays announcement of all-clear
------------------------------------------------------------------
Thai authorities announced a new outbreak of bird flu, forcing them to
delay for the fourth time an announcement that the kingdom is free of the
deadly virus. Thailand was expected to declare the all-clear on Tue 27 Apr
2004 but the discovery last week of bird flu in northern Uttaradit province
meant it had to be postponed until next month, deputy agriculture minister
Newin Chidchob said on Monday.
"We cannot announce it on Tuesday as we planned because Uttaradit is still
under surveillance," he told AFP. Newin said outbreaks in 2 other provinces
reported earlier this month -- which dashed hopes that Thailand had put the
crisis behind it -- were either cleaned up or in the process of being
eradicated.
"Uttaradit is the only province which currently still has a problem and
must be under surveillance," he said, adding that the 21 day monitoring
period there would expire on 10 May 2004. "We expect to make an (all-clear)
announcement after the surveillance period for Uttaradit is over, probably
the next day," he added.
Thailand slaughtered at least 36 million chickens and other poultry and
slapped quarantine regulations on affected zones in an effort to halt the
spread of the disease which hit 41 of its 76 provinces. The kingdom has
reported 12 bird flu infections in humans, including 8 deaths. 4 other
people made a full recovery. Bird flu has swept through 10 countries in
Asia and also killed 16 people in Vietnam.
Thai authorities have been anxious to end the bird flu crisis which
decimated its massive poultry industry, but United Nations health officials
cautioned against a premature announcement that the virus has been
eradicated. Thailand originally planned to declare itself free of the
disease by the end of February 2004 following an initial wave of outbreaks
in January, but was forced to backtrack when 9 more cases were announced on
16 Feb 2004. A similar announcement was then put off on 16 Mar when fears
surfaced that bird flu had re-emerged in 11 provinces.
