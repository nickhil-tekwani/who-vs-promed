The following is the information currently available on the enterovirus
71 (EV71) epidemic in Western Australia.
There have been six cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) identified in
Perth, WA, since March 1999 (2 in March, 2 in April, 1 in May and 1 in
June). Four of these cases are associated with enterovirus shedding
(throat and stool) and EV71 has been identified by neutralisation in two
of the cases. Stool specimens from four of the cases have been
submitted to the Polio Reference Laboratory in Melbourne. Polio
infection has been ruled out in the two cases with confirmed EV71
infection and is pending in two other AFP cases.
Three of the six cases have residual weakness 1-2 months after illness
onset and one case remains in hospital with prolonged flaccid paralysis
requiring ventilation.
In addition, 12 cases of aseptic meningitis associated with enterovirus
shedding (1 CSF isolate, the other isolates from throat and stool) have
been identified. These cases have occurred in association with a large
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFM) epidemic in Perth, WA, over the
same time period.
Also, an enterovirus has been isolated from skin lesions or throat swabs
from 15 uncomplicated HFM cases. None of the aseptic meningitis or
HFM isolates have been typed by neutralisation, but this will be
undertaken in the near future.
The origin of this virus is not known. Clearly, the recent EV71
epidemics in SE Asia suggest a possible source of virus, however, the
acute myelitis that we are seeing in Perth is very different to the
brainstem encephalitis observed in those epidemics. We are preparing to
undertake molecular epidemiology studies on the local EV71 isolates.
We have contacted Ken Lam in Malaysia and Mark Pallansch at CDC
for assistance with this work.
Further information about this epidemic will be provided as it becomes
available.

[Here's an abstract of the earlier outbreak in Victoria, Australia in 1986 -
Mod.CYC
Pediatr Infect Dis J 1988 Jul;7(7):484-8
Outbreak of enterovirus 71 infection in Victoria, Australia, with a high
incidence of neurologic involvement.

Victoria, Australia.
An outbreak of infections caused by enterovirus 71 occurred in
southeastern Australia during the winter of 1986. Infection was
confirmed by virus isolation or serology in 114 patients, 65 of whom
were admitted to hospital. Fifty-one percent of inpatients were infants
younger than 12 months old and 85% were younger than 5 years old.
Many cases of hand, foot and mouth disease occurred in the community
during the epidemic, but 51% (33 of 65) of patients admitted to hospital
had central nervous system involvement, often associated with severe
symptoms. Six patients had encephalitis and one had a poliomyelitis-
like paralytic illness. Various skin manifestations other than hand, foot
and mouth disease occurred, especially in young children, and 25
patients had significant respiratory disease including at least 7 with
pneumonia.
Enterovirus 71 is one of very few viruses that cause hand, foot
and mouth disease as well as a variety of other clinical manifestations.
The most important of these is meningoencephalitis, which causes
significant morbidity, especially in infants and young children.
