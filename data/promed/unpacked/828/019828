Last week [week of 29 Jul 2019], 3 young people were infected with leptospirosis after swimming in the Ognon, a tributary of the Saone. Infection occurred at the commune of Pesme, Haute-Saone.

The place of bathing is a known [hazard] and despite a municipal decree, every year many people brave the forbidden.

Leptospirosis in humans can be very serious and the 3 bathers have also had to be hospitalized. The symptoms are comparable to the flu and appear between 3 to 20 days after the infection. The disease is carried in the water by the urine of rodents, rats, and nutria mainly. We remind you that hunting dogs can also be very exposed and can be vaccinated against this disease.

The Ognon is a river, 214 km (133 mi) long, that flows through the town of Pesmes (https://goo.gl/maps/rMz8CGmuVij8aRwW6); it is a tributary of the Saone River, in northeastern France (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ognon_(Franche-Comt√©)). Pesmes, with a population of 1121 residents (2016), is a town in the predominantly rural department of Haute-Saone in the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comte (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesmes). A map showing the location of Haute-Saone can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/FyYfqgcpb8uiCTEGA.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that is distributed widely throughout the world. Although leptospirosis is more common in tropical areas, it is also found in temperate areas. It is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or fresh (not salty) water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. These animals are mostly asymptomatic but chronically infected with one of the several hundred serovars of the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_.

Many species of wild and domestic animals (including rodents, dogs, cattle, and swine) are susceptible to chronic urinary infection with _Leptospira_. In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, leptospiruria persists for long periods or for life, and _Leptospira_ bacteria shed in urine may survive in fresh water or moist soil for weeks to months.

Leptospirosis is an occupational hazard for people who work outdoors or with animals; for example, workers in wet agricultural settings (such as rice field workers), ranchers, slaughterhouse workers, trappers, loggers, sewer workers, veterinarians, fishery workers, dairy farmers, or military personnel. Leptospirosis is also a risk from household exposure to infected pet animals or rodents.

Also, leptospirosis is a risk during recreational activities such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals.

Outbreaks frequently follow heavy rainfalls, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. - Mod.ML]
