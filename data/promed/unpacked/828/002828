I am writing to you to provide details of investigations being conducted by New South Wales authorities into oyster losses in the Port Stephens area. This follows some media coverage of a speculative nature concerning this incident and associated Pro-MED coverage.

Oyster mortalities in Port Stephens, NSW have been reported to NSW DPI commencing late January 2013. Predominantly affected are diploid and triploid Pacific oysters, but some mortality has also been reported in Sydney rock oysters. NSW DPI has been investigating these mortalities since January 2013 and efforts are ongoing. Unfortunately the industry is continuing to experience stock losses.

NSW DPI's laboratories at the Elizabeth Macarthur Agricultural Institute have excluded OsHV1 in all submissions from Port Stephens to date. In addition, disease has not been identified as a primary cause of mortality in any oyster submissions from Port Stephens. To date the laboratory has received 13 submissions since January - some recently and results are still pending. Available water quality & algal monitoring data is currently being assessed. NSW DPI expects the analysis of current submissions and available information will be completed by early May.

The NSW authorities continue to work with the local oyster industry in progressing its investigations. I reiterate that, to date, an infectious cause has not been identified.'

[To prevent spawning, sterile oysters are now cultured by crossbreeding tetraploid and diploid oysters. The resulting triploid oyster cannot propagate, which prevents introduced oysters from spreading into unwanted habitats. (Wikipedia) - Mod.JW
