A French strain of the deadly rabbit calicivirus has now been confirmed found in Melbourne's eastern suburbs [in Victoria], by Warranwood Veterinary Centre, which also referred to a case in Wangaratta. There is still no official explanation for the outbreak, but RHDV2, which was 1st diagnosed in Europe in 2010, is spreading across south eastern Australia.

Melbourne pet owners have been warned to update their vaccinations, although commercial rabbit breeders say existing vaccinations are not always successful against the new strains. RHDV2 outbreaks have been already been confirmed in Sydney [New South Wales], Canberra and South Australia.

A Korean or Chinese strain of the virus, called K5, is being readied by federal authorities for general release across Australia later this year or earlier this year [2016]. Scientists had imported the virus [RHDV2] from Europe for study several years but chose K5 to replace the original calicivirus (RHDV1), which was also accidentally released in 1995. Another variant of calicivirus called RHDV1A has also been detected in Sydney.

Australian scientists had already examined RHDV2 but had discarded it in favour of K5 for widespread release. They said the French strain "did not appear" to be as virulent as the Korean strain. Scientists have already discovered RHDV2 is not species specific and can kill hares, although not Australian hares. Specific vaccinations for RHVD2 have been developed in Europe but are not yet available in Australia.

Melbourne veterinarians say the virus can act quickly and there may be no sign of an unwell rabbit until it is found dead. The RHDV2 virus may also act slower with rabbits being unwell, quiet or showing signs of gut stasis, which is not eating or defecating. It has been reported in the UK that some rabbits do not develop clinical signs, recover and develop immunity. These rabbits may continue to be infectious for a month or more and can infect other rabbits.

Before the discovery of the latest outbreak, Hobart Angora rabbit breeder Maree Hamming said the industry had "no confidence" the new RHDV strain would not "jump species" and infect other animals. Mrs Hamming said vaccinations, which can cost AUD 10 [about USD 7] per animal, might not work. "This virus is an unknown quantity, this is just a giant experiment," she said. "It beggars belief that 2 viruses got here they don't know about."

The Federal Government will provide AUD 1.2 million [about USD 860 000] for the national rollout of K5. Agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said rabbits caused more than AUD 200 million [about USD 140 million] in damage across the country each year, much of that on Australian farms.

[The 1st embarrassing but very intriguing steps in what is going to be a very interesting wildlife viral epizootic.

To quote my colleague Mod.TG [see 20090311.1015]: Rabbit calicivirus disease (RCD), also known as viral hemorrhagic disease (VHD) of rabbits or rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD), is an extremely contagious and often fatal viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. This disease affects only rabbits of the species _Oryctolagus cuniculus_. This includes most show, pet, and laboratory rabbits.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family Caliciviridae. Many strains of RHDV appear to circulate in rabbit populations; these viruses can have distinct epidemiological and genetic characteristics. Only a single serotype is known, but 2 major subtypes exist: RHDV and the antigenic variant RHDVa. Nonpathogenic strains of RHDV have been identified in wild rabbits. One recent study suggests that different lineages of RHDV may have repeatedly emerged as epidemic viruses.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, as well as on fomites. Rabbits can acquire this disease through the oral, nasal, or conjunctival routes. Most or all excretions including urine, feces, and respiratory secretions are thought to contain virus. Animals may remain infectious for up to a month. RHDV can also be acquired by exposure to an infected carcass or hair from an infected animal. Long term, persistent, or latent infections have recently been recognized in rabbits. Whether viral RNA becomes reactivated in these carriers, and under what conditions, is unknown.

RHDV is readily spread on fomites including contaminated food, bedding, and water. Flies and other insects are very efficient mechanical vectors; only a few virions are needed to infect a rabbit by the conjunctival route. Wild animals can transmit the virus mechanically. Although virus replication does not seem to occur in predators or scavengers, these animals can excrete RHDV in feces after eating infected rabbits.

There is no treatment for RHDV.

Prevention is the best control. Strict biosecurity is essential, and even then insects may pass the biosecurity barriers. - Mod.MHJ
