[1] West Nile virus - Rostov Oblast

A total of 3 cases West Nile fever have been registered this year in
the Rostov Oblast, according to local Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal
Service for Monitoring Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare].
In 2006, 13 cases of West Nile fever were registered in the Rostov
Oblast. The main vectors of infection are mosquitoes.
West Nile fever is prevalent is summer and early autumn. The
reservoirs of infection are predominantly birds. West Nile fever
affects rural populations living close to rivers and lakes where
there is an abundance of wild waterfowl and mosquitoes, and to a
lesser extent city dwellers visiting summer residences and
camp-sites. Infection can occur in houses with flooded cellars, which
mosquitoes can breed. To avoid disease, health officials advise the
use of chemicals to deter [breeding] mosquitoes rather than the use
of electric fumigators.
Every year virologists at the Rostov Oblast Biological Institute
isolate West Nile viruses from mosquitoes caught in the Rostov Oblast
in order to monitor the characteristics of the virus in circulation
in that year.

West Nile fever is annually registered in the Astrakhan Oblast. This
year [2007] is no exception. Anna Slavina, the principal
epidemiologist at the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Service for
Monitoring Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare], reported
that cases of Western Nile fever were observed regularly in the
Oblast.
This year 2 cases had been observed already, although now the victims
have recovered. The peak of morbidity occurs during the period from
July till September. In 2005, for example, 73 cases of West Nile
fever were recorded, including 4 fatalities. A total of 14 cases were
recorded in 2006, including 1 fatality.
In 2007 already 7 persons have contracted West Nile fever. Experts
strongly advise protection from mosquito bites and recommend use of
fumigators, sprays, creams, and other protective substances. Cellars
of premises should be given special attention to eliminate mosquito
breeding sites.

[The Rostov and Astrakhan Oblasts are part of the Southern Federal
District of Russia. Cases of West Nile fever in the territory of
South Federal District are not uncommon. The disease has been
recorded in the Rostov, Astrakhan, and Volgograd Oblasts and the
Krasnodar and Stavrapol Krais.
During 2005, 15 people contracted West Nile fever in the Rostov
Oblast. The actual number of cases of West Nile fever in South Russia
may be greater. It may be the [virus] was present prior to 1999 but
appropriate diagnostic laboratory tests were not available. - Mod.NP]
[West Nile fever has been endemic in the Volgograd and Astrakhan
Oblasts since 1999. During the last 6-7 years single cases and
outbreaks of this disease have been reported in the Rostov Oblast.
The lower regions of the river Don provide nesting sites for huge
number of waterfowl, and migrant birds are the source of infection.
The vectors are mosquitoes. There are many cases of disease
especially during hot summers, when additional generations of
mosquitoes may be observed. Possibly the same scenario applied this
year. A risk awareness campaign needs to be implemented since the
general population has no immunity and no vaccine has been approved
for use in humans. - Corr.VM]
