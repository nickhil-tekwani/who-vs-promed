2003/067 New data on quarantine pests and pests of the EPPO Alert List
------------------------------------------------
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests and pests included on the
EPPO Alert List. The situation of the pest concerned is indicated, using the
terms of ISPM no. 8.
New geographical records
-------------------
Citrus huanglongbin or citrus greening caused by _Liberibacter asiaticus_
[La] (EPPO A1 quarantine pest) was detected in Papua New Guinea at one
location (Sandaun Province, formerly West Sepik) near the border with
Indonesia (ProMED-mail, 2003). The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service
(AQIS) has confirmed the presence of the pathogen in Papua New Guinea. AQIS
had also detected La in the Indonesian part of the island (Irian Jaya) in
1999 and in East Timor in 2000, which is also a new record for the EPPO
Secretariat (AQIS web site).
Situation of La in Papua New Guinea: Present, found in Sandaun Province.
Situation of La in East Timor: Present, no details.
Detailed records
--------------
_Globodera rostochiensis_ [Gr] (EPPO A2 quarantine pest)
-----------------------
This has been found in one potato field in Steuben County, New York, US. This
is the first time since 1986 that the nematode has been found outside the
quarantine area. So far, Gr remains confined to portions of 9 counties within
the State of New York (NAPPO pest Alert, 2003)
Pepino mosaic potexvirus (EPPO Alert List)
------------------------
A US isolate has been characterized and its genome sequenced. So far, the
virus has been detected in tomato samples from Arizona, California, Colorado,
Florida, Oklahoma, and Texas (see also EPPO RS 2001/158). This confirms the
presence of Pepino mosaic potexvirus in USA (Maroon-Lango et al., 2003).
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ [Rs] (EPPO A2 quarantine pest)
-------------------------------
More than 100 suspect cultures were isolated from diseased potato plants from
different regions of Russia in 2001-2002. Studies revealed that 37 strains
were considered as Rs race 1 and 59 strains as race 3 (of which 51 were
determined as race 3 biovar 2). This confirms the presence of Rs race 3
biovar 2 in Russia. Brown rot caused by Rs can cause severe losses in potato
and tomato in some regions of Russia, but no details are given on its
distribution within the country (Matveeva et al, 2003).
New host plants
-------------
_Pantoea stewartii_ (EPPO A2 quarantine pest)
------------------------
This was detected in the weed _Setaria lutescens_, which could act as an
alternative host of the bacterium (Esker et al., 2003).
Epidemiology
---------
citrus psorosis (EU Annexes)
---------------
In the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (US), 4 periods of cold from 1951
to 1989 drastically reduced the area of commercial citrus, as well as the
number of trees affected by citrus psorosis (EU Annexes). The use of a new
psorosis-free cultivar of grapefruit (cv. Rio Red) also contributed to the
reduction of disease incidence. However, during the past 6 years, more
symptoms of psorosis were observed in the field, and the pattern of
infection seemed to follow flood-irrigated rows, suggesting natural spread
of psorosis. Examination of sections of roots and of soil collected from
affected trees revealed the presence of an _Olpidium_- like fungus with
resting spores. Further studies will be done on the possible role of this
type of fungus in the natural transmission of citrus psorosis (Miao et al.,
2003).

[Citrus psorosis virus (CPsV) causes a widespread and damaging disease of
citrus in many parts of the world. It is the type species of the genus
Ophiovirus; other members are Ranunculus white mottle virus (RWMV) and
Tulip mild mottle mosaic virus (TMMMV). Mirafiori lettuce virus (MiLV) is a
tentative member. All are negative stranded - ssRNA viruses, similar in
morphology to those in the genus Tenuivirus. - Mod.DH]
