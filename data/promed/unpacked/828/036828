An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo has contracted COVID-19.

Caretakers noticed that Ramil, a 9-year-old male snow leopard, had a cough and runny nose on Thursday [22 Jul 2021]. Later, 2 separate tests of his stool confirmed the presence of the coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement Friday [23 Jul 2021].

Ramil is not showing additional symptoms, the zoo said, but because he shares an enclosure with a female snow leopard and 2 Amur leopards, the staff assumes they have been exposed. As a result, the animals were quarantined and their exhibit was closed.

It's unclear how Ramil got infected.

In January [2021], a troop of 8 gorillas at the zoo's sister facility, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, contracted COVID-19 from a keeper who had the virus but showed no symptoms.

The gorilla troop, which has since recovered, became the 1st known example of the virus infecting apes.

The case prompted the zoo to request an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals for emergency use. The vaccine from Zoetis, an animal health company that was once part of Pfizer, was administered to species most at risk of contracting COVID-19, including several primates and big cats.

However, Ramil had not been vaccinated before his infection.

There is no vaccine mandate for the staff, but unvaccinated employees are required to wear masks at all times, the zoo said.

[Infection by SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in big cats in zoos around the world. Tigers, lions, pumas/cougars, and snow leopards have previously tested positive, most of them showing mild respiratory signs. A lioness, however, died after contracting COVID-19 in an Indian zoo in June 2021. This is the 2nd report of snow leopards becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2. 3 snow leopards tested positive in December 2021 in Louisville Zoo, Kentucky.

The development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to be used in mammals other than humans is very important, not only to protect animals in direct contact with people from the disease but also to avoid the virus finding a niche where it can be maintained and evolve as immunity in people builds up globally due to natural infection and vaccination. Hopefully, adoption of vaccination in zoos will prevent new episodes like this, as biosecurity practices used in the San Diego Zoo (personal protective equipment including N95 masks, cleaning, and disinfection protocols, quarantine procedures) have failed to prevent transmission in this case. According to a press release by the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, they have recently received a donation by Zoetis of recombinant purified spike protein vaccine, and are currently in the process of administering it. - Mod.PMB
