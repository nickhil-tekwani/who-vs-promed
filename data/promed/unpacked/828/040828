AEDES ALBOPICTUS - CUBA
=======================
It is now official. Through their surveillance system of
55,000 larvitraps (ovitraps made with radial sections of
automobile tires) health authorities in Cuba had found
infestations of Aedes albopictus in 4 municipalities in
greater Havana in October 1995, but yesterday I received a
report from them stating that Cuba is now free of this
mosquito.
