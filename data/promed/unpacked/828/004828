[1] Undiagnosed wilt - Uganda (Bugiri)

Cassava wilt hits Bugiri
------------------------
Cassava wilt disease has destroyed over 21 hectares [52 acres] of
cassava plantations in the district. Farmers in Bulidha, Banda, and
Buluguyi sub-counties said the disease dries up the leaves and stems.

According to a farmer, 4 hectares [10 acres] of his cassava
plantation had been destroyed by the wilt in the past 2 weeks.

The district agricultural officer said efforts were underway to
sensitise farmers about the disease. He said they were trying to
establish the number of plantations affected by the disease and find
a solution.

Thailand cassava crop hit hard
------------------------------
Asia's leading cassava producer, Thailand said its production is
expected to decline by anywhere between 36 and 50 percent this year
[2010] because of severe pest and disease outbreaks in plantations
across the country. The Office of Agricultural Economics (OAE) and
the private sector painted a gloomy picture if no swift action is
taken to prevent pest and disease outbreaks.

Latest figures show that a mealybug infestation has spread in 27
provinces. The government might need to eradicate plants that are 1
to 4 months old to eradicate the pests. The infestation would
definitely affect the tapioca and related industries, particularly
paper and ethanol producers that use tapioca as raw materials. The
Tapioca Policy Committee will work closely with related agencies to
map out an action plan to address the problems.

[More than 20 fungal and bacterial pathogens are known to affect
cassava causing foliar wilts or root rots leading to wilting symptoms
of the shoot. In addition, root rot caused by _Cassava brown streak
virus_ is rife in Uganda and may be involved in the problems reported
in item 1.

In Thailand and other countries of South East Asia, both bacterial
blight (or wilt) caused by _Xanthomonas manihotis_ and brown leaf
spot caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella henningsii_ have recently
been reported to seriously affect cassava crops (ProMED-mail post
20100122.0245).
