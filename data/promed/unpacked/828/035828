More people have been affected by food poisoning after consuming
items from Prima Deli. In the latest update, the Ministry of Health
(MOH) and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) said that the
number of cases has jumped to 143, of which 11 had to be
hospitalized; all have been discharged, except one. 4 more food
handlers at the Prima Deli factory have also tested positive for
_Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis, the bacteria that cause
food poisoning. This brings the total to 6. In a statement, Prima
Deli said the 2 staff who earlier tested positive are receiving
appropriate medical treatment. A food handler in a Prima Deli outlet
has also tested positive for the bacteria.

AVA said another semi-processed product found at the now-closed Prima
Food factory has tested positive for the bacterium. Initial testing
of food samples taken from the factory had shown that the hazelnut
paste tested positive. Prima Deli's chocolate cream also tested
positive for the bacterium.

[A number of the food handlers may have been infected by the
contaminated materials used for the cakes, but the initial source
could have been one of them rather than an egg or other product used
to make the materials.
