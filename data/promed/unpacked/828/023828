First West Nile virus-positive Crow Reported in Eastern Iowa
------------------------------------------------------------
West Nile virus has reached Iowa, state health officials said on Friday 14
Sep 2001. Tests on a crow found crippled in the eastern Iowa town of
Walcott detected the virus, which has been spreading west since appearing
on the East Coast in 1999. The [virus had been found in Wisconsin and
Illinois earlier this fall, and Iowa health experts were expecting its
arrival here.
The virus is often carried by birds, especially crows and blue jays. The
state health department has been testing carcasses of those birds and
monitoring captive chickens for the virus. State epidemiologist Patricia
Quinlisk said that the dead crow found in eastern Iowa could have been
infected by a mosquito in Illinois, then flown west. She noted that the
mosquito season is almost over in Iowa, which should lessen the danger this
year. "It would be very, very, very unlikely that we would have a human
case," Quinlisk said. Still, she said, people should take precautions
against mosquitoes in order to protect themselves from the West Nile virus
and other illnesses, including encephalitis. Suggested steps include using
mosquito repellent, wearing pants and long-sleeved shirts, avoiding outdoor
activities at dusk or dawn and eliminating standing water, where the
insects lay their eggs.
An Iowa company has started making the only vaccine to protect horses
against West Nile virus. Fort Dodge Animal Health received emergency
federal approval last month to sell the vaccine. Rob Daily, who oversees
production of horse drugs for the company, said it shipped 250 000 doses of
the vaccine last month. The [vaccine costs $20 to $30 per shot, and each
horse should get 2 doses, he said. The virus, which is spread by
mosquitoes, is more dangerous to horses than to humans. Daily estimated
that 40 percent of horses who get sick with it die. Symptoms include
dizziness, fever, and muscle loss. Eventually the brain swells, which can
lead to coma and death.
