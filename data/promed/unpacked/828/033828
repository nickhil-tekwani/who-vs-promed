Anthrax scare has come back to haunt again this summer [2012-2013]. Though wildlife in the pristine forest in Nagarahole, Bandipur, and BRT [Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple] tiger reserves [in Karnataka state] are unaffected this season, death of cattle on the forest fringes due to anthrax has the forest officials jittery given that anthrax had claimed 4 elephants in Nagarahole and Bandipur tiger reserves 9 years back. [See ProMED-mail posting Anthrax, elephants - India (Karnataka) 20040328.0850]. Notwithstanding the assertion of the animal husbandry and veterinary sciences that the damage has been contained -- it is 10 days since cattle have been felled by anthrax at a village bordering Bandipur [18 Jan 2013] -- fear stalks the swathes of tiger reserves.

Death of cattle due to anthrax is worrisome. Luckily, there are no animal deaths under mysterious circumstances inside the forested area. It is too early to say that the damage is contained and that it will not strike back, a senior official attached to Bandipur National Park conceded. Pointing at the death of elephants at Nagarahole in 2004, he stated: It is impossible to guess since the disease has claimed wildlife in this part in the past.

The fear started to lurk following death of a 10-year-old tusker due to anthrax in Thalavadi range in Sathyamangalam forest [Tamil Nadu state] bordering BRT tiger reserve in early November [2012]. What is perplexing is that the disease has killed cattle at Bheemana Bidu on Mysore-Sulthan Bathery road. While wildlife in BRT faced the danger, it is now the turn of Bandipur. Bheemana Bidu is located 8 kilometers [5 mi] from Bandipur forest. After it was established that anthrax was the reason for the death of cattle, we've vaccinated over 700 cattle and 450 sheep in the affected region. The disease is now contained and there are no [further] reports of death of livestock due to anthrax, Dr Sundar Raju, deputy director, animal husbandry and veterinary sciences, Chamarajnagar, told TOI. According to him, there are no deaths of cattle or sheep from other parts that border tiger reserves of Bandipur and BRT. "We'll continue vaccination at the affected area for next 2 years since the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_ could survive dormant for 2 years." He said they have advised the villagers not to consume cattle or sheep meat and are keeping a watch over the developments.

The deputy director said there are no reports of human contamination as of now but didn't rule it out pointing out that the bacterium could lie dormant for some time before it become active.

Mysore district has not reported deaths due to anthrax, Dr BM Prasad Murthy, deputy director, animal husbandry and veterinary sciences, Mysore, said. "There are no cases either in Nagarahole region," he said but said they are keeping a close watch.

There are no deaths in 3 tiger reserves owing to anthrax. We've sounded alert and the field staff have been directed to lookout for suspicious death of wild animals. Since livestock is vaccinated, it should not spread, BJ Hosmath, APCCF and field director (Project Tiger), stated.

[This is one way of hearing about livestock anthrax outbreaks! But is a comforting report as it is clear that the wildlife authorities are prepared and the local livestock have been vaccinated. Better to be prepared and little or nothing happens, than wait and be overwhelmed.

Karnataka suffers from chronic enzootic anthrax. Taking just the past 5 years, 2007-2011, there were 16 livestock outbreaks in 2007; 10 outbreaks in 2008 but some 457 sheep and goats were affected; 18 outbreaks in 2009 with 1155 sheep and goats affected and buffaloes; 17 outbreaks in 2010, including buffaloes; and 10 outbreaks in 2011. There were no human cases reported during that period.
