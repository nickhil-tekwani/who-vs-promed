Doctors say Congo epidemic looks less like Ebola
--------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials said on Tuesday the Ebola virus looked increasingly
less likely to be the cause of a haemorrhagic fever epidemic that has
killed 63 people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They also said the epidemic had covered far less ground than had
been feared, with the epicentre at Durba, rather than the larger nearby
town of Watsa in northeastern Congo.
Dr Simon van Nieuwenhove, of the World Health Organisation (WHO)
in the capital Kinshasa, said the Durba area had witnessed similar
outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in 1994 and 1997.
"There have been other similar epidemics, but they were not
thoroughly investigated at the time. It looks less and less like it is
the Ebola virus as, with the exception of one doctor, none of the other
medical personnel at the health centre in Durba were infected, and they
were not wearing protective equipment,'' he told Reuters.
Health officials initially suspected Ebola because the symptoms --
high fever and massive haemmoraghing followed by death within 48 hours
-- strongly resemble those of the deadly virus. The first known case in
the Durba area was in January.
Health workers say the majority of the victims of the current
epidemic were illegal gold diggers in abandoned mines in the area around
Durba. The mines are reportedly extremely unhygienic.
According to van Nieuwenhove, tissue and blood samples had been
sent to the National Institute of Virology in South Africa for
identification.
A medical team arrived in Durba on Sunday and another was due on
Thursday in Feradje, another affected town in the affected region, which
is close to the borders of Uganda and Sudan.
The area is deep inside territory occupied by Tutsi-led rebels
fighting to overthrow the government of President Laurent Kabila. Rebels
occupy vast tracts of eastern and northwestern lands and communications
with the government-held regions are cut.
The leader of the main rebel group, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, said
on Tuesday his movement was monitoring the epidemic and would welcome
medical teams sent in by the Kinshasa government.
"When it comes to the health of the people, the doctors (from
Kinshasa) they can come. There's no problem,'' Wamba told Reuters by
satellite phone from the northeastern city of Kisangani.
Van Nieuwenhove said Kabila had agreed that a mission of Congolese
doctors may travel to the region to help.
"The minister of health announced today that the president agrees
that a team...can travel to Durba. The team could leave as early as
Thursday,'' van Nieuwenhove said.

Disease outbreaks reported
5 May 1999

Suspected viral haemorrhagic fever in Democratic Republic of
Congo - Update

An outbreak has been reported in the Watsa zone, in the
northeastern part of the country. Clinical features include fever,
severe headache, lassitude, gastrointestinal bleeding and agitation,
but according to the health care workers who have looked after
many of the patients, haemorrhagic features are not the norm.
Death has generally occurred 5-6 days after onset.
The first cases are believed to have taken place in January 1999,
however there are indications that since 1994, there have been
multiple small outbreaks of apparently similar illness in the vicinity of
Durba, hence the locally-used description of "Durba syndrome".
Durba, the site of pit gold-mining operations, is situated about 20
km from Watsa. Up to 3 May, 68 cases have been recorded, with
63 deaths (case-fatality rate 93%). Most of the cases have
occurred in gold miners, and a few in the general community. The
chief medical officer of the zone was among the fatalities, but it
seems that secondary spread to family contacts or health care
workers has been a rare event.
Staff from the WHO Regional Office for Africa and a joint team
from Medecins sans frontieres (Belgium and the Netherlands)
have arrived in the area. Clinical samples collected from 5
patients have been sent to a reference laboratory for diagnostic
testing and an epidemiological investigation is under way. An
isolation unit has been set up in Durba, and local health care
personnel are being instructed in preventive and protective
measures, as well as in case management. This report is
preliminary, and updated information will be provided as soon as it
becomes available.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the symptoms of the
haemorraghic fever were not in keeping with [those of Ebola [fever,
which kills 80% of its victims.
Most of the dead were men, they had respiratory complications and
people who had washed the dead bodies had not become infected.
Also, only one doctor [& no other health workers had become sick
despite several treating patients with [sic; should read "without"?
protection.
Health officials initially suspected Ebola was behind the deaths because
victims succumbed to a high fever and massive haemorrhaging
followed by death within 48 hours.
The first case occurred in January in the Durba area in northeastern
DCR.
The WHO said the current outbreak in DCR had not spread as widely as
had been feared and there appeared to be a link with gold-mining.
Many of the men who have died are gold miners, working in extremely
unhygienic conditions.
The WHO said it was unlikely the deaths were linked to poisoning from
mercury used to treat gold. But Dr Ray Arthur of the WHO said: "They
are gold miners and one has to consider the possibility just on that basis
that they may be exposed to whatever is causing the illness in the
mines."
Blood samples from the victims are being analysed by the National
Institute of Virology in South Africa.
Attempts to find out the cause of the outbreak have been made more
difficult by the fact that it has occurred in areas under control by the
Tutsi rebels, who are trying to overthrow President Laurent Kabila.
The UN has called on all parties in the conflict to support efforts to
investigate the outbreak. The leader of the main rebel group, Ernest
Wamba dia Wamba, agreed to allow doctors from the DCR capital
Kinshasa to the area to study the deaths.
Meanwhile, Zambia has put four provinces on the border with DCR on
a health alert. Doctors and an epidemiologist have been sent to the
border town of Kaputa where at least 28 000 DCR refugees are camped.
They will be screened for Ebola.
