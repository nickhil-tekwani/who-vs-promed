Pima County's measles outbreak, the largest in the country, doesn't
appear to be slowing, and some people who assume they are immune may
not be, says the county's top public health doctor. "Basically,
measles is the most infectious disease we know," said Dr Michelle
McDonald, chief medical officer for Pima County.

She said the disease is spread by tiny droplets, blasted from the
infected person's lungs through coughing. The virus can survive for 2
hours in the air. It can be inhaled, coming in contact with a mucous
membrane, or be picked up by hand from a surface and inadvertently
transmitted to a new victim's mouth, eyes, or nose. "Because of that,
a single case is considered an outbreak," McDonald said.

So far 16 cases of measles have been confirmed in Pima County, but
McDonald said there may be many more. It's likely that the cases
popping up now are in the 4th or 5th generation, victims who are 3 or
4 sick people removed from the female Swiss tourist who is thought to
have originally brought the disease here, said McDonald.

"The Swiss woman went to the hospital, and we found one and possibly
2 cases (who were) exposed to her there. And those who got sick from
her exposed others; they exposed others, and they exposed others. And
I think we're starting to see the 5th generation," McDonald said
Wednesday [30 Apr 2008] after administering MMR (measles, mumps,
rubella) vaccine shots for 4 hours at Kino Veterans Memorial
Community Center, 2805 E. Ajo Way. The implication of that scenario
is that with each successive generation the number of additional
people who are exposed increases drastically. Not only are there
massively larger numbers of possible exposures with each generation,
but also it becomes increasingly difficult to track potential
exposure situations.

The woman from Switzerland, who has since returned home, got
pneumonia, sometimes a complication of measles in adults, and was
admitted to Northwest Medical Center. She was treated, and she
recovered, McDonald said. "On the local level, we're looking at
declaring a formal health emergency," McDonald said, although she
said it might not be necessary, as Gov. Janet Napolitano last week
appropriated USD 50 000 and the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) are supplying some MMR vaccine free of charge to
the county.

While many people think of it as a childhood ailment, measles can be
far more dangerous -- even fatal -- for infants and adults,
especially those with compromised immune systems, McDonald said. The
disease can cause encephalitis and pneumonia. She said it usually is
not life threatening in toddlers and school-age children.

Wednesday's [30 Apr 2008] clinic was the latest of several free shot
clinics the Pima County Health Department has held since a measles
outbreak apparently started in mid-February [2008]. Although county
health officials were particularly interested in getting people with
a likely exposure at 2 Tucson-area hospitals late last week to come
to the clinic, most of the roughly 100 who came to Wednesday's clinic
did not come for that reason. McDonald said there is good reason for
those who are unsure to get vaccinated. Some of those people who got
shots in the early days -- the 1960s -- of the measles vaccine might
not be protected. Also, those who got the later, more effective
vaccine may not be protected if they only got [only] one of the
series of 2 shots recommended.

She asked that people think of getting the shots as something they're
doing for others, not themselves. In particular, she urged people to
get vaccinated if they are around those who can't get the vaccine --
those who are immune-system-compromised, pregnant or infants under 6
months of age. Also, McDonald said health officials are now
recommending an accelerated vaccination schedule for infants and
young children.

[The number of measles cases in Pima County, Arizona, (representing
now the largest measles outbreak in the country) has progressed from
a single imported case to the 1st local case on 7 Mar 2008 to 9 cases
on 31 Mar to the present 16 confirmed cases -- some of whom represent
4th generation cases, and 5th generation cases are now expected. The
number of susceptibles (unvaccinated, partially vaccinated, and the
immune-compromised) in the community appears to be sufficient to
sustain an escalating outbreak that may only be contained by a
comprehensive vaccination response.
