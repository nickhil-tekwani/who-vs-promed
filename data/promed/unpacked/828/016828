Among 32 blood samples of viral fever patients [taken] in and around
Jamshedpur [Jharkhand state] and sent separately to 3 of the most
reputable research centres in India dealing with specialised diseases,
8 chikungunya cases have been detected.

A report from the School of Tropical Medicine, Calcutta, which arrived
this evening [2 Aug 2011], showed that out of 10 blood samples sent by
the district health department, 3 were confirmed chikungunya cases. A
report from National Communicable Disease Centre, New Delhi, which
came last evening [1 Aug 2011], but whose contents were divulged
today, said of the 10 samples, 3 had tested positive for chikungunya
[virus].

The Telegraph carried a report today on Tata Main Hospital's (TMH)
initiative, which had sent 12 samples to National Institute of
Virology, Pune. [Of these,] 2 were confirmed cases of chikungunya.

Meanwhile, the health department sent state assistant malaria officer
KK Lal and state entomologist Sagya Singh to MGM hospital and TMH.
They held talks with civil surgeon Vibha Sharan. "The only silver
lining is that the number of viral fever cases is down by 10-12 per
cent," said Lal.

The Union health ministry will send a 4-member fact-finding team from
the Pune institute -- research scientist Yogesh Kumar Gaurav,
technical assistants Gopal Krishnan and P More and attendant NR Khond
-- to visit TMH and MGM hospital tomorrow [3 Aug 2011]. The district
health department has been asked to keep ready a list of viral fever
patients.

The report from Calcutta arrived at the office of additional chief
medical officer (East Singhbhum), Swarn Singh, also district
surveillance officer of integrated disease surveillance project. He
contacted ADM (law and order) Vijay Kumar Singh, who relayed the news
to DC [deputy commissioner] Himani Pande.
