A boarding barn in Carroll County, Maryland, is under voluntary quarantine after one horse tested positive for strangles.

The horse, a 19 year old gelding, developed a cough, fever, and nasal discharge on 20 Dec [2020], and the diagnosis of strangles was confirmed by a veterinarian on 28 Dec [2020], according to information reported to the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC). Twelve other horses at the facility were potentially exposed, and 3 [are] suspected cases at this time.

Also called equine distemper, the infection known as strangles typically begins 10-12 days after exposure to _S[treptococcus] equi_ bacteria. First the horse experiences a high fever, depression, appetite loss, and enlargement of the lymph nodes between the jawbones. Copious amounts of thick, yellow pus begin draining from the nostrils, and before 3 weeks are up, the abscessed nodes at the throat may burst open to drain.

The disease's descriptive name comes from the "strangling" noise produced as severely affected horses struggle to draw breaths into their obstructed airways. Aside from observing the obvious physical signs in diagnosis, veterinarians can run cultures of the nasal drainage to see if it contains the streptococcal organism.

Exposure often occurs when a new horse, who's shedding the _S. equi_ bacterium without visible signs of sickness, is introduced into a herd. The organisms spread from horse to horse through direct contact, such as touching muzzles, environmental contamination, and shared equipment, such as feed buckets and bridles. Strangles spreads rapidly, producing large outbreaks in herds not previously exposed or vaccinated. The infection is especially aggressive in populations of foals and young horses.

Most horses recover, but fatalities do occur, primarily from secondary pneumonia that takes hold in debilitated or immune-compromised animals. And every now and again, _S. equi_ infect lymph nodes deeper within the body, producing a more dangerous condition called bastard strangles.

[The following is extracted from the AAEP/Equine Disease Communication Center Disease Fact Sheet (https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Outside%20Linked%20Documents/DiseaseFactsheet-Strep_equi_final%20Cobranded_0.pdf):

"Disease name: _Streptococcus equi_ equi is also known as "strep equi," or strangles.
Disease type: bacterial infection
Transmission: _S. equi_ is spread from horse to horse through direct contact. Horses can also contract the disease by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces. The disease is highly infectious.
Frequency: _S. equi_ is extremely common. Most horses are exposed and/or infected at a young age.
Incubation period: 3-14 days.
Carrier status: Horses that have been infected but are clinically healthy can continue to incubate and shed the bacteria. A recovered horse may be a potential source of infection for at least 6 weeks after the clinical signs of strangles have resolved. Some horses that have recovered from the disease can become long-term, periodic shedders and can cause outbreaks when introduced to new herds.
Shedding period: Horses infected with _S. equi_ are a source of infection to others and often continue to shed for up to 6 weeks post-recovery.
Latency: _Streptococcus equi_ is present during the incubation period, and the horse can be a carrier without any clinical signs.
Severity: low
Clinical signs:
- fever, usually preceding other clinical signs by 24-48 hours
- abscesses in the mandibular lymph nodes (in the throatlatch and below the jaw)
- nasal discharge: often thick white and yellow mucus
- inflammation of the throat
- difficulty swallowing
- wheezing
- cough
- purpura hemorrhagica: bleeding from the capillaries, which causes red spots on the mucous membranes and swelling of the limbs and head (rare; only in cases with complications)
- swelling of the muscles (rare: only in cases with complications)
Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made through a culture of nasal wash, nasal swab, or pus aspirated from abscesses or through PCR testing.
Treatment: Supportive care is the primary treatment. Use of antibiotics in infected horses is restricted to those with severe clinical signs such as respiratory difficulty, as most horses recover without antibiotic treatment. Horses treated with antibiotics early in the course of infection may avoid lymph node abscesses but may not develop immunity to the disease. Treatment decisions should be made by a veterinarian.
Prognosis: Good. Strangles is rarely fatal, and horses usually make a full recovery in 3-4 weeks with few complications. Horses who have been infected with strangles can maintain long-term immunity to the bacterial strain.
Prevention: An intranasal vaccine is available but is not effective against all infections. Any surfaces contaminated with mucus or other nasal discharge from infected horses pose a threat of infection to healthy horses. After an outbreak, cleaning should involve removal of all organic material from surfaces and subsequent disinfection of water containers, feeders, fences, stalls, tack, and trailers.
Biosecurity: _S. equi_ outbreaks can be hard to prevent because of the prevalence of subclinical carriers (clinically healthy horses who shed the bacteria for weeks or even years after recovery). Outbreaks are common, especially in facilities with high horse traffic where new horses are frequently moved between stables or herds. Whenever possible, new horses should be quarantined for up to 3 weeks when being introduced to a new facility. High standards of hygiene should be maintained in facilities to decrease chance of horses contacting contaminated surfaces. To prevent indirect infection during an outbreak, handlers should avoid coming in contact with susceptible animals after handling infected animals. Handlers should wear protective clothing, avoid using the same equipment on multiple animals, and disinfect hands and equipment when moving between animals." - Mod.TG
