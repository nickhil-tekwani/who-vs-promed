The increasing international transportation of horses means leishmaniasis should be considered a possible cause in any equine that develops skin-related nodules, according to an American expert on the disease.

Clinical Assistant Professor Sarah Reuss, of the University of Florida, said leishmaniasis was a zoonotic disease caused by a protozoal parasite of the genus _Leishmania_.

"There are more than 30 known species of _Leishmania_ that vary with region," according to Reuss, whose research interests include leishmania.

The protozoa are endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres, where it is well described in people and dogs.

"Leishmania infections in humans can result in cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral (organ) lesions. Visceral leishmaniasis is the 2nd leading parasitic cause of death worldwide," said Reuss, writing in the latest issue of Equine Disease Quarterly [http://www2.ca.uky.edu/gluck/q_oct14.asp].

Signs include fever, anemia, diarrhea, darkening of the skin, spleen and liver enlargement, and lymphadenopathy.

Dogs are the most commonly affected domestic species and may act as a reservoir for disease. They can have visceral, eye, and cutaneous lesions. In endemic areas all breeds of dogs are affected, while in the US the disease has been most significant in the foxhound population.

Equine cutaneous leishmaniasis has been documented in horses around the world, Reuss said. Lesions were most commonly observed as nodules on the head, external ear, scrotum, legs, and neck.

These nodules can ulcerate and are often mistaken for aural plaques or sarcoids. Visceral lesions have not been widely reported in the horse.

_L. infantum_ has been reported as the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in horses in Germany, Spain, and Portugal. Recently a report from central Europe identified _L. siamensis_ -- a species previously reported as a cause of visceral human leishmaniasis -- in 4 horses [see item 2 below]. In South America, _L. braziliensis_ has been identified as the causative organism in horses, she said.

Leishmaniasis has been recognized sporadically in the US, mainly in horses with a history of international transportation. Recently, however, 2 horses in Florida were diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis due to _L. siamensis_. [See reference in commentary further].

In all mammals affected with leishmaniasis, the mode of transmission is believed to be by various species of sandflies. In the Eastern Hemisphere, these are _Phlebotomus_ spp, while _Lutzomyia_ spp are predominant in the Western Hemisphere.

The protozoa are transmitted by the female sandfly bite during salivation that occurs during blood feeding.

Diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis in horses is often made by impression smear or biopsy of the lesion with protozoa identified within macrophages, she said. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis can be used to confirm the diagnosis and identify the species. PCR targeting the internal transcriber spacer 1 (ITS1) is most sensitive.

"Lesions in horses are often self-limiting, but several treatments have been used, including surgical excision and medications such as amphotericin, fluconazole, and pentavalent antimony compounds," Reuss said.

The pentavalent antimony compounds (sodium stibogluconate or meglumine antimoniate) are the standard treatment for people and have been used in horses, but these drugs have potentially serious side effects and are not available in the US.

"As lesions often spontaneously regress, it is difficult to determine the efficacy of any described treatment.

"With increasing international transportation of horses, leishmaniasis should be considered in any horse with cutaneous nodules," Reuss added.

"While the disease is not fatal to horses, they can be infected with species of _Leishmania_ that are capable of transmission to humans."

Ref: Sinning D, Koehler K, Litzke LF, et al: _Leishmania siamensis_ as cause of indigenous cutaneous Leishmaniasis in horses in Germany - A new infectious disease in central Europe? [in German, English abstract]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
From our Central European point of view, leishmaniasis is a vector-borne parasitic disease that occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical countries. In recent years there is however an increasing number of reports of indigenous cases in Central Europe, especially in southern Germany. This is probably caused by climate change and global warming and the northward shift of the occurrence of the sandfly vectors.

The aim of the present study was the identification and phylogenetic characterization of the causative agents of these cases. To this end we sequenced several markers of the _Leishmania_ genome and compared them with those of the known _Leishmania_ species. The studied DNA originated from several autochthonous cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in horses and a cow that occurred during the last decade in Germany and Switzerland. The parasites were identified or verified as _L. siamensis_, a newly described species that causes human visceral leishmaniasis in Thailand.

The phylogenetic analyses also showed the similarity with previously not identified strains that caused human cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ghana and Martinique.

To answer the question whether leishmaniasis is becoming endemic as a zoonotic disease in Central Europe further research has to be done on vector compatibility, virulence, and possible reservoir animals.

[Table 1 (on page 19 of the paper above) "Indigenous leishmaniosis cases in animals in central Europe" includes references to earlier recorded cases of _L. siamensis_ in Germany (7 horses) and Switzerland (2 horses, one cow).

The information above on this important zoonotic disease is brought to the attention of equine health specialists, horse breeders, public health authorities, and those engaged in international trade in horses, globally. Leishmaniasis deserves to be included in differential diagnosis of cutaneous lesions in equines, particularly -- but not exclusively -- when dealing with internationally transferred animals. The 'one health' approach deserves to be applied.

Observations elsewhere and comments from the affected and other countries addressing leishmaniasis in equines will be welcomed. - Mod.AS

A few cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by _L. siamensis_ have been described from Germany in 2009 (Mueller N et al: Occurrence of _Leishmania_ spp in cutaneous lesions of horses in Central Europe. Vet Parasitol. 2009; 166(3-4): 346-51; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19800739) and Switzerland in 2010 (Lobsiger L et al: An autochthonous case of cutaneous bovine leishmaniasis in Switzerland. Vet Parasitol. 2010; 169(3-4): 408-14; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153118). With this report, it must be suspected that _L. siamensis_ is established in Europe although further studies especially for a potential reservoir is needed.

In Thailand, where _L. siamensis_ causes human infection, the reservoir is the common rat (Chusri S et al: Animal reservoirs and potential vectors of _Leishmania siamensis_ in southern Thailand. Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 2014; 45(1): 13-9; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24964648).

The cases underline that leishmania infections in humans should be genotyped otherwise the emergence of a new focus with a new genotype will be overlooked. - Mod.EP
