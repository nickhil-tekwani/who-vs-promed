In Lombardy, 60 communes are under specialised supervision. The alarm
has been raised for West Nile virus, the disease [virus] can be
transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes and in severe cases can
cause meningitis. Last year [2009], in 2 months, August and
September, West Nile fever [virus] infected 78 people and 3 died, of
which 2 were residents in Ferrara and one in Mantua.

The virus is exploding and although kept under observation in Emilia
Romagna, it is migrating westward, and has reached Lombardy. An
article in Eurosurveillance of 22 April [2010] takes stock of the
situation: the European health authorities show what are the areas to
be monitored. The Ministry says that the ASL areas [local health
areas in Italy] covered are those comprised between Mantua, Cremona,
and Brescia. The reservoirs of the virus are wild birds and
mosquitoes. Most people infected shows no symptoms, 20 percent had
mild symptoms: nausea, vomiting, swollen lymph nodes. The more severe
symptoms, affecting 1 percent of those who are ill, are convulsions,
paralysis, or encephalitis.

[It is not clear if the "virus exploding" means detection in
mosquitoes only, or if human cases are occurring this year (2010).
With continued presence in this part of northern Italy, one wonders
if West Nile virus has become endemic there.
