Star fish, die off? - USA (Atlantic coast): RFI 981130211206

From: John Dixon <jdixon@coastal.ca.gov>

I don't have any information on Atlantic species. However, several
colleagues and I have been studying the effects of disease on Pacific coast
asteroids since 1982. We were able to isolate the causative organism. Based
on biologicals, it is a new species of _Vibrio_. Disease episodes are
associated with warm water and are generally observed during El Nino. The
disease progresses rapidly, often reducing a healthy appearing sea star to
a pile of ossicles in a few days. Animals with lesions which are placed in
cold water recover rapidly.
The disease has had a large and lasting effect on the sea star community
within the Southern California Bight. Prior to the 1982-1984 El Nino,
_Asterina miniata_ was by far the most common sea star. After 1982, there
were very few individuals of any species present. Over time, _Pisaster
giganteus_ and _Asterina_ have recruited most abundantly. _Pisaster_ is now
the most abundant species with _Asterina_ second.
Although this work has been referred to by others, it has not yet been
published. We sent a manuscript on the demographic effects to Science some
years ago, but it was sent to microbiologists for review and was shot down
because we hadn't done DNA analysis of the bacterium. A final field survey
is scheduled for this month and we have begun writing a ms for an
ecological journal.

John mentions. The warmer the water, the more vibrio you find. - Mod.MHJ
