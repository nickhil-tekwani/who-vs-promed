A University of Chicago [U of C] researcher studying the genetics of
the plague bacteria died last week from an infection he may have
gotten in the laboratory, officials said Saturday [19 Sep 2009]. The
researcher, a 60-year-old molecular genetics professor died 13 Sep
2009 at the University of Chicago Medical Center's Bernard Mitchell
Hospital.

An initial autopsy showed that the researcher "showed no obvious cause
of death" except for the presence of the weakened strain of the plague
bacteria _Yersinia pestis_ in his blood, the U of C Medical Center
said in a statement. It is not known to cause illness and has been
used in some countries as a vaccine to protect against the plague. It
has been approved by CDC for lab studies.

University officials said there does not appear to be a public health
threat related to the death. There have been no illnesses reported by
those who came into contact with him. As a precaution, U of C notified
the researcher's close contacts once the bacteria had been identified
in his blood. The medical center's infection control team is also
working with the city and state health departments and the CDC to
investigate the death.

The researcher had been studying the genetics of harmful bacteria,
including a strain of _Yersinia pestis_ that lacked most of the
bacteria's harmful components, the university said. Because this form
of the bacteria is not known to cause problems in healthy people,
special safety procedures are not required to handle it, said Dr
Kenneth Alexander, a virologist and chief of pediatric infections at
the U of C Medical Center.

Lab researchers who work with the bacteria would typically wear
gloves, a lab coat and protective goggles, and the bacteria would be
disposed of in a biohazard bag and heated for about 2 hours, Alexander
said. 2 key questions in the death will be whether there was anything
different about the strain he was handling and whether the man had any
underlying conditions that may have made him more susceptible to
infection, Alexander said.

"There's no indication thus far that this is anything different from
the laboratory strain that we know it to be," he said. "I can't find
any reports of anything like this happening before."

[ProMED-mail and its readers would appreciate information regarding
the clinical aspects of this case, especially whether the patient's
signs and symptoms were compatible with a sepsis syndrome, also which
attenuated _Y. pestis_ strain was isolated.

The USP, formalin-inactivated plague vaccine was in use in the USA
until 1999 (1). A number of live, attenuated plague strains have been
studied as potential vaccines. One strain, designated EV76, was
produced in Madagascar by passage in guinea pigs treated with nontoxic
doses of iron salts. Severe side effects have been observed (2,3), as
have variable virulence levels in different host species. A more
recently derived strain, CO92deltayopH, has a protein tyrosine
phosphatase type III secretion system effector protein deletion, and
appears to be a potent immunogen (4).
