CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states,
the Indian Health Service, and the FDA (US Food & Drug
Administration) to investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of
human _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Saintpaul infections. An
epidemiologic investigation conducted by the New Mexico and Texas
Departments of Health and the Indian Health Service using interviews
comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons has identified
consumption of raw tomatoes as the likely source of the illnesses in
New Mexico and Texas. The specific type and source of tomatoes is
under investigation; however, preliminary data suggest that large
tomatoes, including Roma and red round are the source.

Since late April 2008, 57 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with
the same genetic fingerprint have been identified in Texas (24
persons) and New Mexico (33 persons). These were identified because
clinical laboratories in all states send _Salmonella_ strains from
ill persons to their State public health laboratory for
characterization. Among the 38 persons who have been interviewed,
illnesses began between 23 Apr 2008 and 27 May 2008. Patients range
in age from 3 to 82 years; 48 percent are female. At least 17 persons
were hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

In addition, 29 persons with the outbreak strain of _S._ Saintpaul
have been reported since mid-April [2008] in residents of Arizona (6
persons), Colorado (1), Idaho (2), Illinois (12), Indiana (1), Kansas
(3), Utah (1), Virginia (1), and Wisconsin (2). Investigations are
underway to determine if consumption of raw tomatoes is also
associated with illness in these states.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
At this time, FDA is advising that consumers in New Mexico and Texas
should limit their tomato consumption to cherry tomatoes, grape
tomatoes, tomatoes sold with the vine still attached, and tomatoes
grown at home. Consumers should be aware that raw tomatoes are often
used in the preparation of fresh salsa, guacamole, or pico de gallo
[a fresh condiment made from chopped tomato, onion, and chili
peppers], and in tortillas or other food products.

The FDA is alerting consumers in New Mexico and Texas that a
salmonellosis outbreak appears to be linked to consumption of certain
types of raw red tomatoes and products containing raw red tomatoes.
The bacteria causing the illnesses are _Salmonella [enterica_]
serotype Saintpaul, an uncommon serotype.

The specific type and source of tomatoes are under investigation.
However, preliminary data suggest that raw red plum, red Roma, or
round red tomatoes are the cause. At this time, consumers in New
Mexico and Texas should limit their tomato consumption to tomatoes
that have not been implicated in the outbreak. These include cherry
tomatoes, grape tomatoes, tomatoes sold with the vine still attached,
and tomatoes grown at home.

FDA recognizes that the source of the contaminated tomatoes may be
limited to a single grower or packer or tomatoes from a specific
geographic area. FDA also recognizes that there are many tomato crops
across the country and in foreign countries that are just becoming
ready for harvest or will become ready in the coming months. In order
to ensure that consumers can continue to enjoy tomatoes that are safe
to eat, FDA is working diligently with the states, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Indian Health Service, and
various food industry trade associations to quickly determine the
source and type of the contaminated tomatoes. As more information
becomes available, FDA will update this warning.

In 2007, FDA began a multi-year Tomato Safety Initiative to reduce
the incidence of tomato-related foodborne illness. The Initiative is
a collaborative effort between FDA and the state health and
agriculture departments in Virginia and Florida, in cooperation with
several universities and members of the produce industry. A key
element of the Food Protection Plan, a scientific and a risk-based
approach to strengthen and protect the nation's food supply, is
prevention. FDA encourages producers to critically reexamine their
operations and apply the scientific principles and regulations
established decades ago to provide a safe product for the consumer.
