I recall a few weeks ago seeing a notification of a cryptosporidiosis
outbreak in the Australian Capital Territory. Now there has been a recent
sudden increase in _Cryptosporidium_ sp. identification in part of coastal
New South Wales.
Background: I am the head of the Microbiology Department at Southern
Pathology, a medium sized private pathology practice (1,100 patients per
day) servicing the east coast of New South Wales, from the southern Sydney
outskirts to the NSW:Victorian border (approximate population 400,000). Since
mid-1995 until recently our lab has not detected any cases of
cryptosporidiosis.
Since 10th February 1998 our lab has seen 13 cases of cryptosporidiosis.
Infections have been found in patients living in a fairly large area,
stretching from the southern suburbs of Sydney to Berry, a small town 120
km to the south. 7 patients have been children under 10 years, while 2 have
been adults over 70 years of age. 5 patients are from the southern
outskirts of Sydney, where a previous _Cryptosporidium_ outbreak around
Christmas 1994-5 with over 50 cases, was traced to a local water sports
complex.
It is likely that other private labs servicing the area, as well as the
public hospitals, have seen at least as many cases as we have in the same
period. The regional Public Health Unit has been notified and has already
issued a warning in the media about hygiene practice.
