To my knowlege and from the newspapers (the scientific communications are
absent) 136 people have been hospitalized in the Rostov region and 6 of them
have died.
Of these people only 65 had clinical symptoms similar to Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever [CCHF (from words on TV of Gennadij Onischenko, the
First Deputy Minister of the Russian Health Ministry).
I have rung colleagues in Russia on cause of this outbreak and it is clear
that diagnosis of CCHF isn't yet confirmed.
Professor Elena Leschinskaya, one of the main Russian health authorities,
confirms that the clinical picture of the disease is not typical for either
CCHF, enteroviruses, tick-borne encephalitis or any respiratory infections
(quoted in "Izvestiya" newspaper, 20 Jul 1999).
Regrettably, in spite of several attempts to get further information from
the other Russian health authorities on this outbreak, I have not been able
to get any sort of confirmation so far. It was impossible, in particularl,
to obtain confirmation on any samples taken for investigation from either
patients or dead persons.
I think that I will be able to obtain more exact information in 1-2 months,
when data on this outbreak will be published in Russian specialized journals
and bulletins, for example, the Russian "Public Health and the Environment"
bulletin.
Essential intermediate information I shall report in addition.

News sources in Russia today issued reports on outbreaks of a hemorraghic
fever in the Rostov and Stavropol regions. While the identity of the fever
is not yet confirmed, Anatoly Lepnitsky, Professor and Deputy Director of
the Volgograd Center for Disease Control, said that examinations of samples
have shown the presence of Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever in 23 out of 28
persons tested.
The outbreak began two weeks ago in the village of Oblivskaya, killing 6 and
hospitalizing at least 136. A second outbreak in the neighboring Stavropol
region has claimed 3 lives out of 7 cases in the villages of Neftekumsk and
Ipatovo.
There have been no additional cases in the past 24 hours in Oblivskaya,
where land is being treated with special disinfectants against insects and
rodents. Itar-Tass reported that the use of a new antiviral medicine is
being proposed by Alexander Lelyak, head of a medical research center in
Novosibirsk. The medicine, Vetom1.1 is said to be able to "subdue a wide
range of pathogenic viruses." It is certfied for veterinary use only but
"is equally effective for all the warm-blooded."
In Stavropol, Health Minister Nikolai Shibkov told Tass that a special
support laboratory would be opened at the Stavropol Anti-Plague Research
Centre in the Budyonnovsk district. In the meanwhile, diagnostic tests are
being run at the Moscow Institute of Virology.
The initial symptoms appeared to be flu-like: high temperature, rheumatic
pains and headache. Later symptoms include vomiting, coma, a plague-like
skin rash, internal bleeding and even fatal brain hemorrhaging.
Doctors believe the outbreak started on 5 July 1999 and that there is
aerosol
transmission via saliva droplets.
News of the outbreaks has, according to the Moscow News report, been slowly
seeping out of the districts, despite a "gag order" and quarantine. This
news service also said that the administrator of the Oblivskaya Internet
service, on 12 Jul 1999 posted information on the epidemic on a web site,
URL and that the server was closed several days
later.
All sources report announcements that the situation is under control and the
epidemic is waning. However, Anatoly Monisov, a department chief at the
Russian State Sanitation and Epidemiology Inspectorate said "It is
disturbing that we cannot identify the virus." Results of tests being run
at the Moscow Institute, he said, will not be available for a month.

[This is all rather confusing:
Minister Gennadij Onischenk is quoted as saying on TV that 65/136 people
hospitalized in the Rostov region "had clinical symptoms similar to
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, " but Prof. Elena Leschinskaya is quoted in
the press as saying that "the clinical picture of the disease is not typical
for ... CCHF."
Prof. Anatoly Lepnitsky is quoted in the press as saying that "examinations
of samples have shown the presence of Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever in 23
out of 28 persons tested," (it not being clear if that means virus
isolation, virus detection by PCR, or antibody detection), yet Anatoly
Monisov is quoted in the press as saying "It is disturbing that we cannot
identify the virus," & that results of tests being run at the Moscow
Institute will not be available for a month."
It is easy to isolate & identify CCHF virus -- I was the first to describe
it from a blood specimen from the then Belgian Congo, & Jordi Casals
identified it in the old Rockefeller Foundation Virus Labs in New York back
in the early 1960s. I am thrilled that Lepnitsky called it Congo-Crimean
hemorrhagic fever, its true name, because back during the Cold War the
Soviets insisted on registering it, against all the rules, as
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever!
Maybe both things are true: there were 23 people with CCHF and a lot more
people with something else so far unidentified - Mod.JW
