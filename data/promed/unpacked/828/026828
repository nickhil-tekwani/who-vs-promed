The following information related to the donkey disease in the Nierteti locality, Central Darfur, Sudan is derived from the All Africa newswire dated Mon 24 Feb 2014 and posted by ProMED in "Undiagnosed outbreak - Sudan (05): (CD) fatal, children, donkeys, spread, RFI 20140224.2297587:"

1. The disease started around 8 Feb 2014 (15 days prior to the report).
2. The clinical signs were severe coughing, weakness, loss of appetite and weight loss.
3. Out of 146 sick animals, 36 have died up to 24 Feb 2014 (case fatality rate of 24.7 percent).
4. A vaccine against the disease is apparently available in Sudan (price given).

Though the said disease is mentioned as coinciding and synchronic with a fatal disease in children, there is no evidence (yet?) that there is a common etiology for both human and animal diseases in Darfur.

Several OIE-listed diseases reported in the past from Sudan may be considered as candidates for differential diagnosis, producing some of the clinical signs described in donkeys. They include African horse sickness, surra (_Trypanosoma evansi_) and equine piroplasmosis. The list of zoonotic diseases of equines includes about 30 entities, some being equine-specific while others being multi-species. Selectively, _Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus_ and _Rhodococcus (corynebcterium) equi_ may be candidates for consideration.

Since vaccination has been mentioned, it would be interesting to note whether African horse sickness should be included in the suspect list. This disease is said to be mild in African donkeys.

Further information on the described health event in donkeys will be appreciated, in particular, identification of the vaccine which has been reportedly considered to address the syndrome. - Mod.AS

[ProMED Veterinary Moderator TG suggests _Rhodococcus equi_.

Human infection
---------------------
"_Rhodococcus equi_, mainly known from veterinary medicine as a pathogen in domestic animals, can also cause infections in immunocompromised humans, especially in those with defects in cellular immunity...

"R. equi infection is predominantly airborne, acquired through the respiratory tract. Exposure to domestic animals, such as horses and pigs, may play a role in acquisition of this organism...

"[A]fter the latest chemotherapy treatment... the patient experienced flu-like symptoms and had a fever of 38.9Â°C... Outpatient evaluation showed 2 lung abscesses. From 3 consecutive blood cultures and from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, a gram-positive bacillus with mucoid growth was isolated and identifi ed as _R. equi_."

"The federal Food and Drug Administration recalled all products produced by Specialty Compounding of Cedar Park [Texas] after reports of bacterial infections affecting 17 patients. 2 patients died... _Rhodococcus equi_ [was] found in the blood of 17 people who fell ill at Corpus Christi Medical Center hospitals, Doctors Regional and Bay Area, said David Ball, a spokesman hired by the pharmacy. "There are literally hundreds of potential sources of contamination" ... The bacterium commonly is found in dry and dusty soil..." See ProMED 2013 archive below.

Equine infection
---------------------
"_Rhodococcus equi _ is responsible for high mortality rates and large economic losses related to severe pneumonia in foals under 6 months of age. This review includes the etiology, epidemiology and pathogenesis with special attention to the surface protein Vapa, its main determinant of virulence. The main [equine] clinical manifestations are presented...

"The disease in its severe form is characterized by massive lung abscesses, the presence of hyperthermia, tachypnea, and depression which may or may not be associated with coughing and nasal discharge. With the progression of clinical symptoms, the animals tend to have anorexia, recumbency, abdominal breathing and cyanosis, which if not immediately controlled culminate in death."
