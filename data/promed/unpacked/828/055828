A resurgence of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] occurred in 3 locations
in Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas [a province of Ecuador]: Pueblo
Nuevo, Colorados del Bua, and Alma Lojana.

In this latter place, Mr. Luis Ojeda's farm has 175 animals affected
by the disease. Mr. Ojeda said that last 8 May [2009?], he bought 28
young bulls "from one Mr. Galindo and from Mr. Jacinto Vera." However,
he never asked from where the cattle [originated].

A few days later, he noticed that the recently bought animals
developed signs of FMD. Their tongues became affected; they started
drooling, and they ceased to eat. As a consequence, these animals lost
weight and passed on the disease to others.

Mr. Ojeda reported the occurrence to the Ecuadorian Agency for
Agriculture Quality Assurance. He also reported that last Sunday [24
May 2009], officers from the aforementioned agency took samples from
infected animals. Until yesterday [30 May 2009], he had not received
any report.

Meanwhile, Mr. Ojeda put together his cattle in the farmyards and
started treating them with traditional animal medicine. He has been
cleaning the mouths of affected animals with a cotton swab embedded
with a mixture containing copper sulfate, methylene blue, and lemon.
With these measures, he said his cattle were improving [Any of these
treatments would have been very painful for the animals. - Mod.TG].

Mr. Ojeda and other farmers from the region are quite concerned; since
the day of his purchase in the local fair, around 4700 animals were
sold. He says that the Santo Domingo Farmers Association (ASOGAN,
according to its Spanish initials) must restart the vaccination
campaign.

Mr. Fabricio Ordonez, manager of ASOGAN, declared that the infected
animal in Alma Lojana was not from Santo Domingo. On the other hand,
Mr. Emilio Andrade, officer in charge of agriculture quality from the
Ministry of Agriculture and Farming, announced that the vaccination
campaign originally scheduled for next 8 Jun [2009] will be put
forward. It is expected that 30 technicians will work in this campaign.

Yesterday [30 May 2009], the Santo Domingo farmers association
requested that Mr. Walter Poveda, Ministry of Agriculture, declare a
quarantine state in the country and to decree that cattle movement
should only be from farms to slaughterhouses in order to prevent a USD
100 million loss in the 1st year as well as losses of USD 60 and 30
million for the following 2nd and 3rd years. These figures are based
on the massive 2002 outbreak.

[Latin America has a plan to rid itself of FMD. Unfortunately, the
disease continues to manifest itself. However, it seems the cattlemen
are quite alert to the signs and can ask for vaccination and
quarantine early, hopefully limiting the spread of the disease.

It does not appear that Ecuador has reported this outbreak to the OIE.
