England: gastroenteritis outbreak at holiday camp in Somerset
-------------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of guests at a Somerset holiday centre have fallen ill with a
serious gastroenteritis infection -- the third year in succession the
infection has struck. More than 100 holidaymakers at the Butlin's Holiday
Centre in Minehead remain ill with what is thought to be a norovirus
infection. A total of 26 new cases were reported on Thu 17 Apr 2003,
compared with 34 on Wednesday, and specialist cleaning measures have been
carried out throughout the resort. Altogether, more than 300 people have
reported suffering symptoms since the outbreak began on Mon 14 Apr 2003.
A spokesman for Somerset Health Authority, which has not closed the holiday
camp, said it was monitoring the situation daily. Tests are still under way
to determine whether the infectious agent is a norovirus. Norovirus
infection is highly contagious and causes vomiting and stomach upsets, but
is not life-threatening.
There are around 8000 guests at an Easter Christian festival at the holiday
centre, and Butlin's have said the Spring Harvest event there is still
going ahead. The BBC's Songs of Praise is due to film at the Festival on
Saturday, and says this will also still take place. Centre director Darren
Hollis said: "We have advised all the guests on site of the situation and
have written to all guests who are arriving within the next week. We have
also issued advice on prevention, such as washing hands before meals and
after using the toilet.
Somerset Health Protection Unit and West Somerset District Council's
Environmental Health Department were first notified of the outbreak on
Monday. A spokesman for Somerset Health Protection Unit said the infection
was not thought to be connected with food consumption. He said: "Gastric
illness of this type commonly occurs within the community and often affects
hospitals, schools, and nurseries. Health officials expect to identify the
cause of the illness in a few days after testing has been completed.
