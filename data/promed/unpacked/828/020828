Two bulls on a Beaverhead County ranch have tested positive for brucellosis.

The Department of Livestock says the bulls were euthanized, and all other animals on the ranch have tested negative for exposure to the bacteria that causes cattle to abort.

The ranch is within Montana's brucellosis Designated Surveillance Area (DSA). The infected bulls were identified during a voluntary whole-herd test, and the ranch has been placed under quarantine.

State Veterinarian Dr. Marty Zaluski said Tuesday [29 Nov 2016] that the early discovery shows the DSA program is working to protect the state and its trading partners.

Officials have determined elk to be the likely source of the brucellosis infections in livestock in the Greater Yellowstone Area.

Livestock officials say this is the 8th brucellosis infected herd found since the creation of the DSA in 2010.

[Brucellosis is caused by the organism _Brucella abortus_. This organism has caused devastating losses to farmers in the United States over the last century, especially if regulatory agencies wanted to depopulate a herd because of it. In 2002, collaborative efforts of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the livestock industries, and state animal health authorities achieved brucellosis-free status in 48 states with no known infection.

The only known focus of _B. abortus_ infection left in the nation is in bison and elk, which originally acquired the infection from cattle. Most of these bison and elk are located within the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA).

The bacterium became established in these wildlife species and does not currently pose a threat for their populations. However, it does represent a big concern for domestic livestock, hence surveillance in elk, taking advantage of samples collected by hunters, is a wise initiative. - Mod.TG
