Re comments made by Malcolm Dobbin, DHS Victoria. 11 May 2000
The use of lemon juice is not a substitute for heat. Nor is heating heroin
a common practice. The vast majority of users here don't heat the mix (some
do as it will speed the dissolving process when the weather is cold or the
rock particularly hard, like chalk) and are not suffering from a failure to
kill off microorganisms. Lemon juice, citric acid or vinegar are in fact
only used in the case where the heroin is in an alkaline form. The solution
fails to go clear until an acid is added, lemon juice being the most
convenient and available form for this purpose. Malcolm Dobbin is correct
when warning of the possible risks of injecting lemon juice, vinegar is the
safer substitute.
The practice of injecting into the muscle is also not so rare. Some prefer
IM and do so in some cases to minimise vein scars that are more visible due
to repeated injection into the same spot and as the original author
(Scotland) correctly pointed out is more common among women. You can vary
the site more when injecting IM. Again we are not seeing such consequences
as are being described in Scotland. The other relevant point here is that
in the course of a user injecting into their vein, it is very common for
them to "POP" the vein ie go too deep, too shallow or miss all together.
Again we aren't seeing the proliferation of this lethal condition as a
result. It would seem there is more info needed to explain what is
happening in Scotland, given that users have been doing all these things
for decades here and not suffering as a result of those practices per say.
It would be foolish to offer answers from such a distance. I do however
find myself suspecting the dope they are using given that the use of citric
acid points to alkaline heroin. One of the more common forms of alkaline
heroin is what users call "beige" or Turkish brown or brown sugar and tends
to be a more raw form of the drug than the "China white" that is most
common now here in Australia. In fact generally the trend toward the white
rock form here has meant users are generally getting a purer cleaner
substance.
Some brown heroin contains byproducts of manufacture such as strychnine and
although often injected here is mostly smoked in Asia due to this less pure
state.
I would certainly want to rule out the dope itself or a contaminant in it
as a possible factor first. It is not impossible for a batch of heroin to
be contaminated with any number of things and should be seriously
considered rather than looking for explanations in what are common
practices all over the world. Less pure forms as indicated by the use of
citric acid are more likely to be suspect. Contamination could more easily
go unnoticed with brown heroin than with white although it is of course
possible with both.
Let's hope for every ones sake the cause is found quickly and that we
aren't looking at another blood borne condition.
