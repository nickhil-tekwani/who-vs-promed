Federal researchers are, according to this story, stepping up efforts to
find an effective live test for scrapie, and additional compensation is on
the way for Canadian shepherds whose flocks have been stricken with the
fatal brain disease. Canadian Food Inspection Agency scrapie specialist Dr.
Ron Rogers, was cited as saying that Canadian officials have joined forces
with their U.S. counterparts to study a new test for the rare disease.
While the exact details of the research haven't been worked out, scientists
hope to test up to 1,000 sheep across Canada using the experimental
technique, which extracts a tiny amount of lymph tissue from the corner of
a sheep's eye. The $375,000 program will, according to this story, also
establish an infected flock of sheep. The flock of scrapie-stricken animals
will not only allow researchers to gauge the test's effectiveness, but
should give scientists a better idea of how well it works on lambs who
aren't yet showing signs of the disease.
