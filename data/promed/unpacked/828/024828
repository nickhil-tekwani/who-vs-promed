On 23 May 2018, a Bubulo East member of parliament reported a strange disease affecting children in Manafwa district, Eastern Uganda in the floor of parliament. In addition, Uganda Radio Network reported that 14 children have been affected, 8 of which had died, and 6 were still hospitalized. The major symptoms reported among these children were dark urine following onset of high grade fever.

Parliament subsequently requested the Ministry of Health to carry out investigations and identify the strange disease. We therefore set out to confirm the existence and scope of the rumor/problem, determine the nature and diagnosis of the disease, identify possible exposures, and recommend evidence-based control measures.

Methods
-------
We defined a suspected case as onset of high grade fever and red/black/brown/maroon coloured urine with any of the following: loss of appetite, fatigue, abdominal pain, abdominal distention, anemia, jaundice, headache, vomiting, palpitation, sweating and painful urination.

We actively searched for suspected cases in Bugobero HCIV [health centre IV] and some of the affected communities. We reviewed current and past medical records for the suspected cases (deceased inclusive) whenever available.

We conducted in-depth interviews with some of the mothers/care takers of the sick children and mothers/care takers of some of the verified deceased children. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with Bugobero HCIV healthcare workers (health facility in-charge, nurses, clinicians, and laboratory staff), Manafwa district officials (district surveillance focal person (DSFP), Gombolola internal security officer (GISO), and the district health officer (DHO)).

We also interviewed the in-charge Bugobero HCIV on the status of the key logistical and material requirements for management of such cases. We collected blood and urine samples for 16 suspected cases and had them shipped to the Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL) for laboratory analysis. Rapid Diagnostic Test for malaria was conducted for in all the 16 suspected cases.

Preliminary findings
--------------------
As of 31 May 2018, 222 case persons have been line listed, 190 got through records review (Majorly Chrisco HCIV) and 32 got through active case finding in the affected communities and admissions.

Of the 222 case persons, 16 (2018=9, 2017=5, 2014=1, 2003=1) were reported to have died (investigation team verified the deaths through verbal autopsy and facility records review) (case fatality rate=7.2 per cent).

The majority of case persons presented at the health facilities with dark urine (98 per cent), anemia (94 per cent), high grade fever (93 per cent), splenomegaly (87 per cent), and jaundice (84 per cent). All the case persons (100 per cent) with current episode of illness presented with high grade fever, abdominal pain and dark coloured. Majority of the case persons present with anaemia (97 per cent), palpitations (97 per cent), general body weakness (94 per cent), jaundice (88 per cent), vomiting (84 per cent), and loss of appetite (81 per cent).

The epidemic curve suggests a continuous common source outbreak. Most of the current episodes started appearing on 17 May 2018. Most of the case persons 65 per cent (144/222) are males. The mean age of case persons is 5 years (SD=3) with a range of 6 months to 16 years. The most affected age group is 0 to 9 years (93 per cent).

Of the 32 case-persons who have had the latest episode of illness, some started exhibiting similar signs and symptoms as far back as the year 2010 and half of them have had more than 10 episodes. A big proportion of the case-persons, 44 per cent (14/32) have experienced episodes of illness 1 to 2 weeks after receiving treatment. Majority of the case-persons with current illness episode, 81 per cent (26/32) received blood transfusion. When asked whether they were transfused before during earlier episodes, 100 per cent of them said yes, more than half having received more than 5 transfusions.

Most of the cases underwent the following laboratory tests: RDT [rapid diagnostic test] for malaria (_Plasmodium falciparum_), blood slide for malaria, hemoglobin levels, and HIV.

The majority of the case-persons, 90 per cent (132/147) were positive for malaria by RDT. Of the 26 case-persons tested for malaria by microscopy, 73 per cent (19/26) had malaria parasites seen. The mean hemoglobin levels of case persons at time of admission was 5g/dl (SD=2), ranging from 2 to 10 g/dl. Because of low Hb levels, 42 per cent (59/142) of case persons were transfused with blood while 14 per cent (20/142) were given haemoforte. All case-persons tested for HIV turned out negative.

Records of case-persons revealed that majority (76 per cent) were given intravenous artesunate on admission during the different episodes. The 32 case-persons will current illness episode have all had IV quinine, IV artesunate and tabs coartem [artemether-lumefantrine] during different episodes of their illness.

All the case-persons with current illness episode, 100 per cent (32/32) [reported at some point having] purchased medicines over the counter to treat malaria and other ailments. Over half of them, 56 per cent (18/32) of case persons had [at some time] ingested local herbs or traditional medicine to treat malaria or its complications, including anemia.

Bugobero sub-county had the highest attack rate (AR=57/10 000) followed by Butiru sub-county (AR=36/10 000) in Manafwa district.

The malaria normal channels indicated an upsurge of malaria cases in Bugobero sub-county between the months of February [and] November 2017 and the month of February 2018. Important to note is that the period of upsurge coincides with the increased number of cases of suspected black water fever (BWF) who on average visited the health facility 3 times in a month; and Bugobero sub-county hosts Bugobero HCIV where most of the suspected cases are referred for management of severe malaria.

A total of the 11 urine and blood samples from case-persons with current episode of illness were analysed at CPHL. The urine results showed no _Schistosoma haematobium_ ova, protein and bilirubin were detected in most of the samples. The blood results: sickle cells detected in 1/11 samples, the rest were normal; 3 tested positive for _Plasmodium falciparum_ by microscopy; 9/11 tested positive for malaria by RDT; Hb was low in 9/11 samples; neutropenia and leukopenia were detected in most samples. G6PD enzyme assay is still pending.

Conclusion
----------
Based on the clinical presentation, medical history of the case persons, and preliminary laboratory findings, this is haemolytic anaemia most likely due to black water fever (BWF), a severe form of _P. falciparum_ malaria in which blood cells are rapidly destroyed, resulting in dark urine. The predisposing factors are still not known however, the possible hypotheses are: a) treatment with quinine, b) treatment with artesunate, c) rainy season with an upsurge of malaria, d) use of herbal medicines.

Next steps
----------
- Continue with active case search in the affected community and update the line list.
- Conduct more laboratory tests as appropriate.
- Conduct an analytical study to establish exposure factors.

[ProMED-mail greatly appreciates the information provided by Dr Alex Riolexus Ario on this outbreak. Our complements to the Uganda National Institute of Public Health for a rapid, thorough, and well conducted investigation. It is convincing that the outbreak was due to malaria and not a haemorrhagic fever. - Mod.EP
