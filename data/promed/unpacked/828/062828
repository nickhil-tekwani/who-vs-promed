As far as we know, the first mortalities in camels were reported in
northern Mali in mid-November 2005.
A first investigation by the vet services here revealed 55 mortalities, of
which 33 were in females. The cases appeared to have been hyper-acute,
without distinct disease signs.
The treatment of pastures with insecticides is now suggested as a possible
cause of these deaths. These acaricide treatments have been conducted
within the framework of the control programme against desert locusts, which
devastated the agricultural harvest in the Sahel area last year.
It is unclear why cattle and small ruminants did not suffer the same
mortality rates. I'll keep you informed of the final outcome of the ongoing
investigations.
