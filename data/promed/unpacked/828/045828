K-9 influenza outbreak reported in central New Jersey
-----------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of canine influenza has beeen reported in the Millstone region.
Over the last several weeks, NorthStar VETS, a specialty and emergency
trauma hospital located in the Clarksburg section of Millstone, has seen an
increasing number of patients being admitted for the treatment of this virus.

There have been 9 cases in the hospital so far, and because of its
contagious nature, more are expected. Canine influenza is not contagious to
people, cats, or other species, although people can carry the virus in
their nasal passages and transmit it to dogs at home.

Canine influenza should be considered a serious disease; infected animals
have a 100 per cent mortality rate. However, with a rapid and accurate
diagnosis, proper treatment can reduce this statistic to a 1-5 per cent
mortality rate, according to information from the hospital. According to Dr
Daniel Stobie, owner of NorthStar VETS, "It is a new virus. There seems to
be a resurgence, with young and older pets being more susceptible."

NorthStar VETS is encouraging dog owners to be vigilant and on the lookout
for signs such as difficulty breathing, dry coughing, nasal discharge, high
fever, severe lethargy or lack of appetite. If any of these signs are
displayed, they suggest isolating the dog from other animals and seeking
medical treatment immediately.

In conjunction with recommendations from the state veterinarian and
Department of Agriculture, the hospital has been disinfected and fumigated
to eliminate the virus. In addition, NorthStar VETS has arranged to have a
mobile isolation unit on the property located away from the hospital to
accept and manage influenza cases. This mobile isolation unit is equipped
with oxygen and medical supplies for the treatment of patients. The main
hospital will function as normal to receive referrals and emergency care.

"While this is a disconcerting virus, NorthStar VETS is completely prepared
to assist family veterinarians and pet owners alike to manage this crisis,"
said Brie Messier, hospital administrator, NorthStar VETS. "We are very
pleased to have been able to mobilize quickly and efficiently, allowing us
to be a resource to the community. Together, we hope to save many family
dogs."

[Canine influenza is a type A orthomyxovirus. It mimics "kennel cough" or
_Bordetella brochiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex, which sounds like a
hacking cough that does not seem to stop. The cough with canine influenza
can be either moist or dry and about 20 per cent of infected dogs may show
little or no clinical signs but still be shedding virus. Canine influenza
is contagious by aerosolized droplets and contaminated fomites (inanimate
objects) that the dog can contact. People can transmit the disease to their
pets.

Unfortunately, treatment is non-specific but generally supportive. It is
important to get treatment early to reduce the death rate.
