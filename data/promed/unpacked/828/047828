H3N2 canine influenza virus outbreak, dog, fatal, 11 states, United States

There's an outbreak of dog flu affecting at least 11 states. After inundating Chicago with flu and bouncing around the country in 2015 and 2016, the H3N2 virus, which arrived from Southeast Asia, took a lower profile. But, clearly it never went away. Last month [May 2017], the H3N2 dog flu virus popped up again, and in a big way. The epicenter might have been 2 dog shows.

Guesstimates are that 300 or more dogs have been infected with H3N2. Approximately 30 to 40 cases have been confirmed via diagnostic labs. Also, there are several confirmed fatalities.

States with confirmed H3N2 are currently Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, California, Illinois, and Texas. Some states appear to have only a few sick dogs, while others have many more. Many argue that H3N2 is endemic in the Chicago area, which means it may linger in the environment for a long time.

[In ProMED-mail posting Influenza, canine - USA (03): (NC) dog show link Archive Number: 20170610.5096162, I predicted we would see a much broader outbreak as those exposed at the show would travel home and expose those animals nearby or that they socialize with. This certainly appears to be the case. We will likely be hearing more about this disease. Please protect your pet. Get it vaccinated. Be cautious of going to doggie social events (dog parks, green ways, etc). Do not share water or water bowls between your pet and some one else's pet. Be cautious of where you take your pet. - Mod.TG
