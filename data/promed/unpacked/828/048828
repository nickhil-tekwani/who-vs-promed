Another 3 Ebola cases have been confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province Ebola outbreak, raising the total to 72, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said on Twitter today [31 Jul 2020].

The fatality count declined by 1, bringing that total to 31.

The WHO has said the rising incidence and geographic spread is concerning, as is the number of confirmed cases that remain in the community or have been lost to follow-up, factors that raise the risk of further spread.

The outbreak, the DRC's 11th, is occurring in the same province in the country's northwest region, where an outbreak occurred in 2018 that sickened 54 people, 33 of them fatally.

Ebola in Democratic Republic of Congo: response report and case studies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
How organisations funded by the Humanitarian Emergency Fund (HEF) responded to the Ebola crisis in DRC in 2019.

The integrated report, including case studies, covers work done by the following HEF-funded organisations:
- British Red Cross
- Christian Aid

9. Conclusions
Despite the hugely challenging conditions for member field staff, partners, and volunteers, both projects delivered their outcomes. BRC [British Red Cross], through the IFRC [International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies] and local volunteers, planned and delivered more than 5000 safe and dignified burials to prevent family members contracting and spreading the virus further. This was complemented by a wide range of community engagement activities. Similarly, CA [Christian Aid] focused their effort on communications, working with 160 community leaders to reach more than 300 000 people in the target areas, building trust in Ebola response workers, and fostering community ownership of the response. They also delivered a significant WaSH [water, sanitation, and hygiene] intervention to improve hygiene to further slow the spread of the disease.

Both organisations worked closely with international, national, and local partners and agencies to improve the effectiveness of the overall fight against Ebola. The data gathering and community feedback mechanism operated by the Red Cross was the largest it had ever mounted in this type of response. Through this concerted effort over a number of months, the HEF [Humanitarian Emergency Fund] funded agencies have played a significant role in halting the spread of Ebola in the DRC, with no new cases reported since mid-February 2020, with the WHO "cautiously optimistic" that the outbreak will soon come to an end.

However, with ongoing insecurity and population displacement, the risk of the virus re-emerging is still high with overall funds to maintain surveillance and response rapidly depleting. Nevertheless, and despite the Red Cross's work so far, the level of help needed remains extremely high, and the situation could deteriorate again, particularly given the potential impacts of the outbreak of coronavirus [COVID-19]. Whilst this is a serious concern, this recent extensive experience of community disease surveillance will play an important vital role in helping to tackle the latest threat disease threat posed by COVID-19 to the DRC and many other vulnerable countries and will inform a range of better community engagement and preparedness, infection prevention and psycho-social support for those affected.
