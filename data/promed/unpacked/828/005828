Alves MJ, Fernandes PL, Amaro F, Osorio H, Luz T, Parreira P, et al. Clinical presentation and laboratory findings for the first autochthonous cases of dengue fever in Madeira island, Portugal, October 2012. Euro Surveill. 2013;18(6):pii=20398.

Abstract
--------
An outbreak of dengue fever in Madeira island was reported in 2012. Clinical and laboratory findings of the 1st 2 laboratory-confirmed autochthonous cases are reported. Both cases had fever (38 C [98.6 F]) and petechial rash. Symptoms also included myalgia, asthenia, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diffuse abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. The 2 cases were confirmed by serology and one tested positive for a dengue viral sequence. Dengue virus serotype DEN-1 was identified with probable Central or South American origin.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
Between early October 2012 and the beginning of 2013, 2144 autochthonous dengue virus infections were reported in the island of Madeira. There were no reports of severe disease and a decrease of new cases in the last weeks of 2012 was observed.

Dengue virus is transmitted by _Aedes_ mosquitoes, namely _Aedes (Ae.) aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_. _Ae. aegypti_ was introduced in Madeira probably from a Caribbean country (personal communication, M Melim, 2009) and its presence was detected for the 1st time in 2005, in the city of Funchal.

The 1st cases of the dengue fever outbreak in Madeira, as the majority of all cases, happened in Funchal, the urban environment where the mosquito _Ae. aegypt_i was 1st found. In 2012, the combination of the high vector density with multiple breeding sites in the city and lack of immunity of the population are likely to explain the dimension of the outbreak.
