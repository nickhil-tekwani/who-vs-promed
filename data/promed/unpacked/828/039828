Currently, Polynesia is "at the beginning of an
epidemic of dengue [virus] type 4" as was
announced yesterday [11 Mar 2009] by the Ministry
and the Directorate of Health. Since early 2009,
29 cases of confirmed dengue 4 (including 2
imported from New Caledonia) were recorded. Just
last week, 18 new cases of dengue type 4 [virus infection] were recorded.

[Of these dengue cases] 7 live in Bora Bora,
Tahaa 8, 2 in Tahiti and one in Moorea. Since 23
February [2009], 26 cases of dengue 4 [virus
infection] in total have been confirmed, mostly
in and Tahaa Bora Bora. The other cases of the
infection have traveled in other localities:
Faa'a, Moorea and Ua Pou. But so far, no
hospitalization or severe forms [of the disease]
have been reported, health authorities stated.
One should recall the instructions of the fight
against sources of mosquitoes, and especially in
case of onset of fever, headache, aches, signs
suggestive dengue it is advisable to consult your
doctor or nearest health facility more quickly.

[The 12 Mar 2009 report in Tahitipresse.fr (in
French)(<http://www.tahitipresse.pf/index.cfm?snav=see&presse=26956>)
indicated that dengue 1 virus was circulating in
the islands, too. For the week of 2-8 Mar [2009],
6 cases of dengue 1 virus infection and 18 cases
of dengue 4 virus infection have been laboratory
confirmed. Among these 18 cases of dengue 4 virus
infection, no epidemiological link was found
between them. The report goes on to state that in
the Pacific region, epidemic dengue 4 is still
rampant. If the number of cases begins to decline
in the 1st countries affected (Kiribati, Vanuatu,
Cook Islands ...), it increases in New Caledonia.

In this country, dengue so far has affected 3189
people and caused 2 deaths since September 2008.
Currently, more than 1500 cases of dengue fever
per month have been recorded, the majority of
cases of dengue being due to dengue virus 4, but also to dengue virus 1.

More than 2000 Sri Lankans have been caught by
dengue fever this year [2009], representing a 15
percent increase compared to the same period of
2008, health experts said Thursday [12 Mar 2009].
Officials from the Epidemic Unit of the Health
Ministry said that 2229 people acquired dengue
[virus infection] from the beginning of this year
[1 Jan 2009] to 9 Mar 2009 while 17 people died of the disease.

They said the death cases increased sharply this
year as only 25 people were killed by dengue
[virus infection] in the island in 2008. The
capital Colombo is a badly affected area with 5
people having died of the epidemic so far this year [2009].

According to medical officials, there are 2 peak
seasons for the spreading of the epidemic in Sri
Lanka each year: one is from October to December;
another is from May to July. The government has
asked the public to clean the environment and
destroy all possible hatchery sites of mosquitoes
which are the carriers of the dengue viruses.

Epidemiological Record No. 11/12 [edited]
<http://www.who.int/wer/2009/wer8411_12.pdf>


An alert was issued following the diagnosis of an
acute infection caused by dengue virus 3 (DENV3)
in one Japanese tourist and one French
expatriate, both of whom were hospitalized (in
Tokyo and Marseille, respectively) upon their
return from Abidjan; their visits occurred
between May and July 2008. The virus isolate was
similar to the DENV-3 genotype that had been
circulating in Saudi Arabia in 2004.
Additionally, the Centre National de Reference
des Arbovirus in Paris also identified positive
anti-dengue immunoglobulin M (IgM) in 7 of 14
specimens collected from suspected dengue cases
occurring in travellers returning from Abidjan
between 1 May 2008 and 31 Aug 2008. Further
analysis by reverse-transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) identified additional
cases who were positive for DENV-3.

In 2008, reports from the Institut de Veille
Sanitaire in Paris also identified a sharp
increase in imported cases of dengue in
travellers returning from Cote dIvoire; of 12
cases reported between 1 Jan 2006 and 31 Aug
2008, 8 were reported in 2008, 3 in 2007 and one
in 2006. In 2008, Cote dIvoire was faced with
the co-circulation of yellow fever virus and
DENV-3 in Abidjan city and the surrounding
suburban areas. This raises questions of whether
there was an urban transmission cycle for dengue
in Abidjan and whether it was caused by an
emerging serotype since DENV-3 has never been
reported in west Africa. To better assess the
extent of the epidemic and the risk of dengue in
Abidjan, a team from WHO and the Ministry of
Health followed up with an investigation in
Abidjan during 2­16 Sep 2008. The yellow fever
surveillance system helped the follow-up team to
obtain specimens from humans, mosquitoes and
monkeys. The investigation team also collected
mosquito and serum specimens from around the
residences of confirmed dengue cases (where this
information was available) and established an
active case-finding system in health-care centres
in districts reporting confirmed cases of yellow fever.

The surveillance systems established in
health-care centres by the Ministry of Health
identified many cases of suspected classical
dengue but did not detect any severe cases or
deaths. However, specimens were not collected and
laboratory diagnosis was not available. DENV-3
was confirmed by RT-PCR in 2 specimens collected
as part of routine surveillance during week 19 (1
from Cocody Bingerville and 1 from Adzope). The
vector and larval indices were high and above the
threshold of 5 percent in these areas.

Additionally, a sylvatic transmission cycle has
been documented in west Africa, where DENV-2 has
been found circulating among _Erythrocebus patas_
monkeys and various sylvatic _Aedes_ species,
including _Ae. taylori_, _Ae. furcifer_, and _Ae. luteocephalus_.

[Although this report mainly focuses on past
dengue cases in Cote d'Ivoire, since information
about dengue cases coming out of West Africa is
so little, it is valuable to know what has been
going on in the recent past. It would be of
interest to know if dengue virus can be
maintained in wild primates and the _Aedes_
species mentioned above, alone, in the absence of
human cases. A HealthMap/Promed-mail interactive

The number of reported dengue cases for central
Trinidad has begun to climb. Data obtained from a
medical source in the Chaguanas area indicated
there were "92 plus cases" reported from public
and private facilities for the last 3 months.
This figure was described as "slightly higher than normal."

The trend was corroborated by the Chaguanas Mayor
Surujrattan Rambachan who said information he
received was that there was an average of 100
cases for the 1st 2 and one-half months of this
year [2009]. He said there was one suspected
death in the Charlieville area and a Piarco resident was hospitalised with DHF.

Despite a media blitz advising the public about
taking precautions to prevent dengue, last year
saw an increased number of dengue cases with some
persons saying there was an "outbreak." However,
the Health Ministry has insisted there was no
outbreak. In its 2008 End of Year Dengue Report,
the ministry had 3832 "identified, reported
cases" out of which 100 were "confirmed" by the
Trinidad Public Health laboratory. There were 6 confirmed deaths.

The Insect Vector Control Division of the
ministry dynafogged 102 986 houses and ULV [ultra
low volume] sprayed 417 148. Residual spraying was done at 9948.

To date in the province, 42 cases of dengue have
been recorded, making Esmeraldas the canton with
the greatest incidence of cases of this tropical
disease. The epidemiologist of the provincial
Health Directorate, Washington Benavides Delgado,
explained that they have 25 confirmed dengue
cases and 18 yet to be verified. Because of this,
control measures have been increased in those
sectors where the cases have been recorded, so that no fatal cases occur.

According to Benavides Delgado, the National
Malaria Eradication Service has materials and
tools to control the proliferation of the
[mosquito] vectors that transmit tropical
diseases. Moreover, they can count on the help of
Esmeraldas Health and the Environment [agencies],
as it relates to promotion and dissemination of
the prevention campaign through communication
media to communities and educational centers when there are classes.

"If there is no citizen participation with help
in cleaning their patios [yards], we can not
eradicate dengue," stated Benavides Delgado.

Peru registered 5000 cases of dengue fever during
January and February [2009], which has become a
public health problem, Health Minister Oscar
Ugarte said on Monday [9 Mar 2009]. Ugarte told
the press that 13 500 people were infected last
year [2008]. He announced the launching of a
campaign against dengue designed to raise public
awareness of the importance of clearing stagnant
water or hidden water deposits where the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, a dengue [virus] carrier,
breeds. "We have an enormous responsibility to
combat dengue because it is lethal ... a high
social cost on human lives," Ugarte said.

He said combating dengue was easy. Daily actions
were needed to avoid water stagnating in topless
containers, and replacing water in flowerpots
with humid sand both at home and at public
places. Ugarte also called on Peruvians to clear
roofs or yards of tires, empty bottles or boxes
where rainwater can accumulate. "It is a national
campaign. If we do not take measures now, we will have an epidemic," he said.

[While it is theoretically easy to reduce water
catchments in which _Aedes aegypti_ breed, it is
obviously difficult to do in practice, as
reflected in the dengue epidemics that occur
annually, despite campaigns to involve the
public. However, any effort to reduce the
populations of these vectors is worth doing.

A case of DHF was confirmed by the state
Secretariat of Health in Icaraima, a municipality
in the northwest of Parana [state]. There was
also a reported case of dengue fever with
complications in Cambe, North. Despite the 97
percent decline in the number of cases in Parana
last year, the confirmation of the case was of
concern to the Secretariat of Health because it
shows that the state is not free of the disease this year [2009].

According to the State News Agency, the concern
is because the months in which there is a greater
concentration of cases are precisely March, April
and May. According to the Secretariat, new cases
of DHF could occur this year in view of the large
number of recorded dengue fever [cases] in recent years.

Simple measures can control the disease. The goal
is prevent the mosquito that transmits dengue
[virus] to proliferate, reducing places where still water accumulates.

Between January and the end of February this year
[2009], 14 people died -- victims of DHF in
Bahia. The situation is more worrying in Itabuna,
a city with more than 2000 reported cases of the
disease, according to information from the
Secretariat of Health. Just in the last 6 days,
in the Hospital de Base, 600 people were seen with symptoms of the disease.

In the city, there now have been 5 deaths
confirmed by laboratory tests, according to the
Secretariat. Between this past Monday and Tuesday
[9-10 Mar 2009], 2 other deaths suspected to have
occurred from the diseases have not been confirmed by the Secretariat.

Throughout the state, 15 395 dengue fever cases
have been reported, 208 percent above last year
[2008]. An additional 123 cases are DHF.

The authorities of the Ministry of Health
reported today [8 Mar 2009] the detection of the
1st DHF case in Paraguay, where 368 people have
now suffered from the benign variety of the
disease so far this year. [As noted in comments
in previous updates, sufferers of classical
dengue "breakbone" fever would hardly term it "benign." - Mod.TY]

The official indicated that this more virulent
type of dengue, which can cause death, was
diagnosed in a man who resided in the Capiata
locality, 25 km [16 mi] east of Asuncion, and for
whom more information was not given.

According to the Ministry of Health, the majority
of the 368 cases of this disease, transmitted by
the bite of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, were
reported so far this year in the northern
department [state of province equivalent], along the border with Brazil.

The above mentioned agency moreover mentioned
that currently an average of 20 [dengue] infections per week were reported.

And another thing, Allende recalled that the
health authorities established a risk period for
transmission that could extend until this May
[2009], facilitated, according to the official,
by the rainy season which favors the proliferation of the mosquito vector.

Paraguay registered an epidemic outbreak in 2008
with 18 illnesses of the benign variety, while in
2007, dengue took the lives of 17 people, of a
total of 27 000 [dengue] infections.

Mayor Hector Pallares stated that a significant
number of suspected [dengue] cases have been
detected. As in Seanz Pena, Campo Largo and
Charata, there is a national health team working
on preventive tasks. "It is something that is expanding," he said.

In statements made on the program "1st Light" on
The Radio 104.7, Pallares confirmed that Avia
Terai was also having a dengue outbreak, based on
a significant number of suspected cases
recognized lately. Although unwilling to give
numbers, the community head indicated that while
the Ministry of Health of the province says it
has to wait until results arrive from the
laboratory in Pergamino, the doctors and the people say it is dengue.

Also, Pallares acknowledged existing concern and
that there is a national health team working in
the locality, on preventive measures such as
fumigation and consciousness raising of the
people so that they take necessary measures. "It
is necessary that everyone, the national
government, the province, the municipality and
the neighbors, work on prevention."

In addition, the mayor noted that he maintains
constant contact with his counterpart from Campo
Largo, Juan Carlos Fariello, in order to know the
situation in other locations where dengue cases
are occurring. "This is something that began in
Campo Largo and is spreading throughout the province," he said.

[In the 7 Mar 2009 report by Yahoo Noticias (in
Spanish)
<http://es.noticias.yahoo.com/9/20090307/tsc-ya-son-dos-los-muertos-por-dengue-he-539a483.html>,
posted by ProMED-ESP, the 1st DHF death occurred
in Salto. The Salto government has declared a
medical emergency in 3 of its departments; Oran,
San Martin and Rivadavia, to prevent an outbreak.
These 3 departments are along the Bolivian
border, a country with a serious dengue outbreak
currently. The Argentina health authorities are
carrying out control actions in order to slow the
epidemic after finding locally acquired cases in
the northwest part of the country. There have
been 74 of these confirmed locally acquired cases
and 420 cases associated epidemiologically as
well as 144 cases imported from other areas.
Mod.JRT commented, "The occurrence of high
mortality rates during the 1st appearance of a
DHF outbreak in a region,when the primary health
care workers are not completely familiarized with
the management of these severe forms of the
infection, is not unusual. The fatality rates
observed in Latin American countries where dengue
presents a recurrent problem, varies between 0.15
- 0.30 per 1000 reported cases. If we consider
the fact that these notified cases always
represent an important under-reported real number
[of dengue cases] it is estimated that for every
reported dengue case there are between 10 - 20
undiagnosed cases), the expected fatality rate would be considerably less."
