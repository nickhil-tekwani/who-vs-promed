Nine children between the ages of 3 and 13 years [of age] have died as a result of an outbreak of cerebral spinal meningitis (CSM) in Majia town of Taura local government area [LGA] in Jigawa State.

Sources had indicated by last night [6 Mar 2018] that the death toll had hit over 20 as the outbreak was said to have been recorded in other LGAs of the state.

A father of a 3-year-old who died 3 days ago as result of the outbreak told newsmen in Majia that most of the deceased started by complaining of severe headache, which was later accompanied by vomiting and diarrhoea. Contacted, the State Commissioner of Health, Dr. Abba Zakari, confirmed the outbreak of the disease, and promised further details today [7 Mar 2018].

[Jigawa, with a population of 4.3 million residents, located in north-central Nigeria, is one of 36 states that constitute the Federal Republic of Nigeria state; its capital is Dutse (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jigawa_State).

Northern Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt, the semi-arid areas of sub-Saharan Africa where epidemics of meningococcal meningitis recur each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June. _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A has been the main cause of epidemic meningococcal disease in this region (http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/meningitis/whoemcbac983.pdf). However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt, beginning in 2010, WHO has noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/), and _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen, having been replaced by other serogroups, notably serogroup C, and other bacterial species.

Although the organism causing the current meningitis outbreak in Jigawa state is not given, it may very well be meningococcus serogroup C, which caused an outbreak in Nigeria in 2017 (see also's below). We await further updates on the outbreak from Nigerian officials.
