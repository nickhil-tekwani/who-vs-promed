Egypt: 3rd child [32nd case] tests positive for bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
A 3rd Egyptian child has tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus, bringing the number of human cases in Egypt to 32, state news
agency MENA said on Saturday [31 Mar 2007]. An official with the
Health Ministry said the 4-year-old girl came from Qalyoubia
province, north of Cairo, MENA said.
Earlier, the health ministry said a 4-year-old boy from Qena
province, around 670 km (416 miles) south of Cairo, and a 7-year-old
boy from Sohag province, around 470 km south of Cairo, had been
infected with bird flu [see: Avian influenza, human (62): China,
Egypt, WHO 20070331.1103].
The 4-year-old girl was admitted to hospital on Friday [30 Mar 2007],
MENA said, while the 2 others were admitted on Thu 29 Mar 2007. All 3
had been suffering from fever and had been treated with the antiviral Tamiflu.
Egypt has the highest number of confirmed human bird flu cases
outside Asia; 13 Egyptians have died from bird flu since it 1st
surfaced in the country's poultry a year ago [2006]. Most of those
who fell ill were reported to have had contact with sick or dead
household birds [poultry], primarily in northern Egypt.
