In the Netherlands today, 2 new cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) were
confirmed, bringing the total number of outbreaks in continental Europe to 23.
The infected farms were in 2 towns, Heerde and Wapenveld, in the east of
the country, already affected by the epidemic. Dutch farmers protested in
Kootwijkerbroek against the mass culling of animals in angry scenes that
led to 16 arrests.
