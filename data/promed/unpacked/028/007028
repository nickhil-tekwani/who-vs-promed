A Victorian man in his 80s has become the 5th person to die in a listeriosis outbreak after eating contaminated rockmelons [also known as cantaloupes]. A total of 3 Victorians and 2 people from New South Wales have died after consuming fruit linked to a farm in southern NSW.

Victoria's deputy chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, said the latest death had been linked to the outbreak only after test results came back. "Sadly, the investigation has also confirmed that a miscarriage has also been linked to the outbreak," Dr Sutton added. Victoria's health department would not provide further details about the victim, including the date of his death.

As many as 8 people in Victoria have been affected with listeriosis from the melons - 4 men and 4 women -, all from high-risk groups. Cases have also been reported in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania.

The outbreak has been traced to Rombola Family Farms near Griffith. In a statement on [Thu 15 Mar 2018], the business said it was working with the NSW Food Authority to "identify, quarantine and remedy" the source of the listeria. "As a family business we are all too aware of the impact the outbreak is having on fellow growers and the wider industry," the statement said. "We remain ever vigilant to food safety and contamination risks and are focused on working to achieve a resolution for all stakeholders." All affected melons, have been withdrawn from sale and distribution.

The NSW Food Authority said rockmelons currently on the shelf are safe to eat. The authority is also considering imposing additional regulation on the rockmelon industry to ensure compliance with food safety. Farmers have described the outbreak as a national disaster that will take the industry years to recover from.

A 3rd Victorian has died and a woman has suffered a miscarriage after a national outbreak of listeriosis linked to contaminated rockmelons. The death of a man in his 80s brings the national death toll to 5. "This latest case has only just been linked to the outbreak as a result of our microbiological testing," Victoria's Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Brett Sutton said. "Sadly, the investigation has also confirmed that a miscarriage has also been linked to the outbreak."

There have now been 19 recorded listeriosis cases across Australia. The outbreak has been linked to 2 other deaths in Victoria and 2 in New South Wales. There have now been 8 recorded cases in Victoria, 6 in NSW, 4 in Queensland and 1 in Tasmania. The affected Victorians, 4 men and 4 women, were all in high-risk groups.

Health authorities have connected the outbreak to rockmelon grower Rombola Family Farms in the Riverina region of New South Wales. The NSW Food Authority said it was working with the business in Nericon, near Griffith to determine the exact cause of the outbreak. "The Food Authority is now working with Rombola Family Farms in an effort to support the business and the wider rockmelon industry as it works to recover from the impact of the outbreak," it said in a statement on [Tue 13 Mar 2018]. The authority is confident all affected produce has been removed from the supply chain and the rockmelons currently for sale and export are not contaminated.
