The University of Kentucky's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed a West Nile virus (WNV) diagnosis affecting a 12-year-old Palomino gelding in Powell County, Kentucky.

On 4 Nov 2016, the horse presented as lethargic and febrile (with a fever) and had a poor appetite, according to an Equine Disease Communication Center report. State animal health officials confirmed the WNV diagnosis on 11 Nov 2016.

This is the 7th equine case of WNV reported in Kentucky for 2016. None of the 7 horses had been vaccinated for WNV.

West Nile is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Clinical signs for WNV are flulike, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation; hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

Horse owners should also consult their private practicing veterinarian to determine an appropriate disease prevention plan for their horses. Vaccines have proven to be a very effective prevention tool. Horses that have been vaccinated in past years will need an annual booster shot. However, if an owner did not vaccinate their animal in previous years, the horse will need the 2-shot vaccination series within a 3- to 6-week period.

In addition to vaccinations, horse owners need to reduce the mosquito populations and their possible breeding areas. Recommendations include removing stagnant water sources, keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times, which are typically early in the morning and evening, and using mosquito repellents.

[Vaccinate, Vaccinate, Vaccinate!!! It should be the mantra of every horse owner. WNV vaccine is effective and usually combined with EEE (eastern equine encephalitis), WEE (western equine encephalitis), and tetanus. When it is made this easy it is baffling as to why owners have not vaccinated.

It is late in the year for this disease, especially in Kentucky, but mild weather can still provide great weather for a mosquito. - Mod.TG
