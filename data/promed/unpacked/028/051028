[Bezet borders southwest Lebanon. Earlier in 2015, Israel reported 8 outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 in commercial poultry farms; the control and eradication policy applied is based upon stamping out, compensating the affected holders, accompanied by severe animal movement restrictions in line with EU requirements. Several outbreaks were reported from the adjacent Palestinian Territories, both in the West Bank and the Gaza strip (which borders the North Sinai province of Egypt). All these outbreaks can be seen in the interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/o5tmqu6 (click on the Eastern Mediterranean cluster, zoom in).

The previous outbreaks in Israel were located in the Haifa and Hamerkaz (Central) districts. The event was resolved on 11 Feb 2015. See the event summary and map at, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=16982

Genotyping of the causative agent will be helpful in checking its origin. The Gaza strain was suspected to be related to a HPAI H5N1 strain circulating in Egypt. - Mods.AS/CRD]
