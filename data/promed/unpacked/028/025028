An outbreak of a viral disease has led to the muskmelon growers of
Kapurthala and Jalandhar [districts] facing heavy losses. Farmers
blamed private companies for selling them virus-infected seeds,
without any check from the horticulture department.

The viral disease has affected over 2 dozen villages. It has led to
deformed growth of the muskmelons, leaving them to rot on the field.
The farmers have faced estimated losses of 30 to 35 percent. The
figure may increase as over 12 000 acres [about 4900 ha] of land are
under muskmelon cultivation in the region.

When asked why the seeds sold by private companies are not checked,
Dr Baaj Singh, Horticulture [department], said: "We have no such
powers. Selling of spurious seeds can be checked by the state
agriculture department. We are educating the farmers to check the
further spread of the viral disease."

Muskmelon crops in Punjab have been infected by diseases -- downy
mildew and cucumber mosaic virus -- raising fear of extensive damage
to the crop. Punjab Agricultural University [PAU] in its survey said
muskmelon growing in areas of Jalandhar and Amritsar have been
affected. "Both diseases have appeared in severe forms and could
spread fast if appropriate control measures are not taken in time,"
PAU Plant Pathologist TS Thind said.

He said, in Amritsar district, cucumber crops have also been attacked
by downy mildew. Muskmelon is an important cucurbit crop of Punjab and
it is being grown in an area of 985 hectares [about 2400 acres] in the
state. PAU experts said frequent rains and high relative humidity
during the past days provided a suitable environment for the
development of downy mildew disease.

Thind said that the cucumber mosaic virus is a seed borne viral
disease. Apart from this, many weeds and cultivated cucurbits serve as
source of the virus. When virus infected seed is sown, the seedlings
exhibit symptoms of green and yellow patches on the leaves, he added.

[Muskmelon (_Cucumis melo_) includes several subspecies and many
cultivars, both with smooth (such as honeydew) and netted (such as
subsp. _reticulatus_, rockmelon or cantaloupe) skins.

CMV
---
_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV) is found worldwide affecting a large
number of hosts (around 190 recorded species) including many crops.
CMV exists in numerous strains, which may vary in their host range,
symptoms, and means of transmission. In most hosts, it produces a
systemic infection affecting newly formed tissues. For muskmelons, new
leaves may wilt and die while older crown leaves may turn yellow then
dry up, resulting in a slow decline of plant vigour and severe yield
reduction.

CMV can be transmitted by more than 60 species of aphid vectors and
can also be spread with infected plant material and very effectively
by mechanical means (for example, during melon picking). Seed
transmission to varying degrees has also been reported in 19 host
species, including some weeds (which may act as pathogen and vector
reservoirs) and a few inbred lines of muskmelon. No information is
provided above about the melon cultivars grown in Punjab and it
appears that more information would be needed to verify the suspicion
that the current outbreak is due to contaminated seeds.

Disease management for CMV is difficult since aphid vectors and virus
reservoirs are widespread. Control of weeds surrounding cropped fields
has shown some success. Host resistance is available in some crops but
may only be effective against some of the virus strains.

A new strain of CMV has been reported previously to cause diseases of
muskmelon in Punjab (Sharma et al. 1984, Phytopath. Z. 109, 332-40).
An outbreak of an undiagnosed virus was reported from Punjab in 2008
(ProMED-mail post 20080523.1695), but it is not clear whether this was
caused by CMV since other viruses are also known to affect melons in
the region (for example, _Zucchini yellow mosaic virus_, _Cucumber
green mottle mosaic virus_).

Downy mildew
------------
Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits. _P. cubensis_ is found worldwide,
but it is usually most damaging in tropical and subtropical areas.
Different pathogen strains with variable host preferences (pathovars)
seem to exist. By affecting the leaves and thus the photosynthetic
potential of its host, downy mildew reduces yield and fruit quality,
and it can eventually kill the host plant. If appropriate conditions
are present, plantings can be infected so rapidly that they appear to
have been frosted.

The fungus is an obligate parasite surviving on cultivated or wild
cucurbits, and volunteer crop plants or cucurbit weeds may serve as
sources of inoculum. The disease is spread by wind, rain splash, and
mechanical means. Disease development can occur over a wide
temperature range under conditions of high humidity. Control
strategies include the use of resistant cultivars as well as
applications of protectant and systemic fungicides.
