Scientists taking a 1st look at the genetics of the bird flu strain that recently killed 2 men in China say the virus could be harder to track than its better-known cousin H5N1 because it might be able to spread silently among poultry without notice.

The scientists said Wed [3 Apr 2013] that the H7N9 virus seems troubling because it can generate no symptoms in poultry while seriously sickening humans.

Dr. Masato Tashiro, a WHO scientist studying the virus' genetic data, says the virus also appears to have mutated into a form that enables it to more easily infect animals such as pigs, meaning they could serve as hosts that spread the virus more widely among humans.

H7N9 is previously known only to have infected birds. The preliminary findings need further testing.

[Since human-to-human infection of the current H7N9 virus seems to have, so far, not been confirmed, animals remain as the suspected direct source for human infection. The animal-health related characteristics of the strain need urgent elucidation, preferably including experimental trials to study its infectivity and pathogenicity in various candidate animal species.

In addition to domestic poultry (chickens, geese, ducks etc.), mammals -- in particular pigs -- deserve special attention, as also suggested above by Dr Masato Tashiro. China's pig population is the world's largest; its cohabitation with populations of humans and wild and domestic fowl has long been regarded as favourable for genetic reassortment.

The need for enhanced veterinary surveillance and improved biosecurity in China's pig industry has been recently illuminated by the mass deaths of pigs pulled from rivers in the Shanghai area, so far without satisfactory etiology becoming available.

***This is just indicative of the need for enhanced surveillance, and should by no means be interpreted as a suspicion that an avian influenza virus has been involved in the (continuing) pig mortality event (see also http://tinyurl.com/c54ut25).

It will be interesting to note whether and in which animal species AIV H7N9 has been discovered in China during recent years. One publication described the isolation of an LPAI (low-pathogenic avian influenza) strain, namely A/duck/Mongolia/119/2008(H7N9), in north-central Mongolia in 2008 (See E.-O. Tseren-Ochir, B. Damdinjav, T. Sharkhuu et al. International Journal of Infectious Diseases, Vol 14, Supplement 1 , Pages e164-e165, March 2010. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971210018862).

H7 viruses in animals are notifiable to the OIE, even if they are of low pathogenicity. - Mod.AS
