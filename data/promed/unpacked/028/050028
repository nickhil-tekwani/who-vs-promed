Since 1 Mar 2006, the Health Protection Agency Centre for Infections (HPA
CfI) in London has received [reports of] a total of 59 isolates of human
[_Salmonella enterica_, serotype] Montevideo infection in England and Wales
(1). Of these isolates, 53 (90 per cent) are fully sensitive to the panel of
antimicrobial drugs used by the national Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens.
For the purposes of this investigation, a case is defined as a resident of
England [or] Wales with a confirmed, fully sensitive _S._ Montevideo
infection received by HPA CfI on or after 1 Mar 2006 with the pulsed field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profile designated SmvdX07.
Five cases in people reporting foreign travel and 2 secondary cases were
excluded. Of the remaining 46 cases, 31 (67 per cent) share the SmvdX07
profile and 11 (24 per cent) differ from this type. Molecular
characterization of the remaining isolates is continuing.
The median age of the SmvdX07 cases is 2 years (range 0-52). The median age
of the non-SmvdX07 cases is 30 years (range 0-96). Though 3 SmvdX07 cases
(10 per cent; 1 infant, 1 child and 1 adult) were admitted to hospital, no
deaths have been reported. Two non-SmvdX07 cases were admitted to hospital.
Onset dates available for 30 cases demonstrate that the majority of recent
cases fit the outbreak profile [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]. The
epidemic curve is suggestive of a continuous source exposure.
Enquiries were sent out on 13 Jun 2006 to all countries participating in
Enter-net, the international surveillance network for the enteric infections
Salmonella and VTEC O157
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>), to find out whether
increases had been seen outside the UK. An enquiry was also to public health
authorities in other European countries 23 Jun 2006 via the European Early
Warning and Response System (EWRS).
Since January 2006, there have been a small number of cases of Montevideo
infection in other countries participating in Enter-net. Some countries have
reported infections in children under 6 years of age, but none have reported
an increase over the same period in 2005. The SmvdX07 PFGE image was sent to
all participating countries on 20 Jun 2006 to ascertain whether their recent
cases conform to the SmvdX07 profile.
Retrospective examination of all _S._ Montevideo isolates received by LEP
during 2006 revealed that there were 9 anonymized isolates referred to the
HPA CfI for identification and serotyping between Feb and May 2006. These
were from food-related items but no further information was given. As part
of the outbreak investigations, these isolates were examined using PFGE and
their profile was found to conform to that of SmvdX07. As a result, the UK
Food Standards Agency was informed. Further PFGE work is being carried out
on other non-human isolates.
A definitive epidemiological link has not been established between the
current increase in _S._ Montevideo infection and the consumption of any
food. The HPA is continuing its epidemiological and microbiological
investigation into this increase and are assisting local authority
investigations of food manufacturing premises in the West Midlands, and
South West HPA Region.
