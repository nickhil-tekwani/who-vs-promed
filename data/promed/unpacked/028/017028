Encephalitis, a hot summer season disease in Morang, has been affecting
increasing numbers of people this year. Seven people have died in the zonal
hospital due to this disease within the last one month while three people
have died in the district health posts. According to the zonal hospital, a
large number of patients are visiting the hospital in recent times.
Eighteen patients have returned home after completing their treatment in
the hospital while 15 are still undergoing treatment.
A doctor of the hospital said that pressure of patients from Morang,
Sunsari, Jhapa and Udayapur districts is increasing while two people from
Arariya in India have returned home after they were cured. Twelve people
had lost their lives last year from encephalitis. The highest number of
patients who had died of encephalitis in recent years was four years ago
when encephalitis claimed 29 lives.
Though the number of encephalitis patients is increasing, treatment is
going on as normal and those who come to hospital for treatment in the
preliminary stage are recovering fast.

[Last year's thread included considerable speculation that the encephalitis
was largely Japanese encephalitis. This report is less specific. We have
requested further details. Mods.ES/MHJ
