Recommended composition of influenza virus vaccines for use in the
2009-2010 northern hemisphere influenza season
----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that vaccines for use in the 2009-2010 influenza
season (northern hemisphere winter) contain the following:
- an A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like virus; *
- an A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)-like virus; **
- a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. #

* A/Brisbane/59/2007 is a current vaccine virus; A/South
Dakota/6/2007 (an A/Brisbane/59/2007-like virus) is a current vaccine
virus used in live attenuated vaccines.
** A/Brisbane/10/2007 and A/Uruguay/716/2007 (an
A/Brisbane/10/2007-like virus) are current vaccine viruses.
# B/Brisbane/33/2008 is a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.

[The WHO recommendation relates to the composition of vaccines for
the forthcoming influenza season in the northern hemisphere (November
2009 to April 2010). A recommendation will be made in September 2009
relating to vaccines that will be used for the influenza season in
the southern hemisphere (May to October 2010). For countries in
equatorial regions epidemiological considerations will influence
which recommendation (February or September) individual National
Authorities consider more appropriate.

Between September 2008 and January 2009, influenza activity was
reported in Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. In
general, activity was lower compared with the same period the
previous year, but in some European countries activity was higher. In
the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued in many
countries in September-November [2008] and in particular peaked in
Australia during September. Influenza B viruses predominated in
Australia and New Zealand while A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B viruses
circulated in other countries to varying extents.

In most parts of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity was
mild. Regional outbreaks, particularly in Japan, Tunisia, and many
European countries, due to A(H3N2) were reported in December [2008]
and January [2009]. In North America, while A(H1N1), A(H3N2) and B
viruses co-circulated, A(H1N1) viruses predominated in the USA and B
viruses predominated in Canada.

The extent and type of seasonal influenza activity worldwide are
summarized in detail in a document accessible at
