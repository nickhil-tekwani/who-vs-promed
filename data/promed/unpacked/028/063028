Mysterious death, probably caused by an agrochemical, causes the
death of 100 animals in the province of Entre Rios
More than 100 chickens and 30 dogs died this week, possibly because
of poisoning, in Basavilbaso, previously a Jewish colony, in the
province of Entre Rios, department of Uruguay. The deaths coincided
with the fumigation and spraying of insecticides.
Local experts are investigating the cause and affirm that the
symptoms point to some toxic agent but that, as of yesterday, they
had not yet identified the product responsible for the deaths.
Local authorities are also investigating the case. So far, there have
been no reports of ill persons. The residents of the area have
expressed their concern not only because of their dead animals, but
also because of the risk of people being affected by the toxic agent.

pesticide/insecticide/toxin that may have been used. More information
