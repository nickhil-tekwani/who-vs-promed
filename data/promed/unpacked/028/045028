Bat fungus documented in Oklahoma
----------------------------------
Laboratory tests performed at the US Geological Survey National
Health Center in Madison Wisconsin have confirmed that a cave myotis
(_Myotis velifer_) bat collected alive on 3 May 2010 from a cave in
northwest Oklahoma has tested positive for the fungus _Geomyces
destructans_. This fungus is associated with a condition known as
"white nose syndrome", which appears to be specific to some species
of hibernating bats and was first observed in 4 caves in New York
during the winter of 2006.

Bats with white nose syndrome (WNS) have noticeable white fungus
growing on their skin, particularly on their noses and other bare
surfaces including their wings. White nose syndrome frequently
results in the deaths of the infected bats. Biologists continue to
study the bat specimens to determine if all bats that come into
contact with the fungus will develop the disease. There have been no
reported human illnesses attributed to the fungus or to white nose
syndrome, and there is no evidence to suggest that the syndrome is
harmful to organisms other than bats.

Although genetic tests indicate that the bat was harboring the
fungus, the pattern of infection was not consistent with the white
nose syndrome infection observed in bats in the eastern United
States. There also has not been a mortality event attributable to
white nose syndrome in Oklahoma to date. Both the Oklahoma Department
of Wildlife Conservation (ODWC) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(FWS) are concerned about the potential development of white nose
syndrome in Oklahoma in the near future. The ODWC and FWS's Oklahoma
Ecological Services Field Office anticipate working in partnership
with other federal and state agencies, researchers and conservation
partners to monitor other Oklahoma caves and bat populations for the
fungus and signs of white nose syndrome.

This finding is the 1st record of the fungus in Oklahoma and
represents the most western report to date. The next closest known
report of the fungus occurred in eastern Missouri earlier this year
[2010]. To date, all of the white nose syndrome cases have been east
of the Mississippi River. This finding also represents the 1st
discovery of the fungus in a bat species that does not occur in the
eastern United States. The range of the cave myotis extends from
western Oklahoma and Texas west and south into New Mexico, Arizona,
California, and Mexico.

The potential impact of white nose syndrome is considered to be
significant due to the highly beneficial ecological and economic
roles played by bats. Bats consume mosquitoes, moths, and other
night-flying insects including species that cause extensive forest
and agricultural damage. Additionally, bat guano provides essential
nutrients to many otherwise nutrient-limited cave environments where
other animals live.

Currently, white nose syndrome is believed to be transmitted
primarily through bat-to-bat contact. However, it is possible that
the fungus could be transmitted by humans who enter caves and carry
the fungus on their shoes, gear, and clothing. Within the past 4
years, white nose syndrome has been documented in 11 states and 2
Canadian provinces and is considered likely in 2 additional states
where the fungus has been found.

about ongoing research, recommended decontamination procedures for
caving gear and clothing, and answers to frequently asked questions,

These bats have a diverse range from southern California, to
Missouri, but are only found seasonally in Texas. Although they are
found in a broad area, it is not a continuous pattern of coverage,
but rather, large pockets of population throughout this region.

This is an interesting post, as it has not yet resulted in bat
mortality. Hopefully this heralds a moment when the disease has begun
to wane. If there are reports of mortality of the bats we would
appreciate a notification. - Mod.TG]
