Manitoba: West Nile Virus Update - 99 Confirmed Equine Cases
--------------------------------------------------
Birds
10 more birds have tested positive for West Nile virus:
Winnipeg (6 crows, 1 blue jay),
Killarney (1 crow),
Morris (1 crow),
RM of St. Clements (1 blue jay).
The total number of confirmed positive birds from the crow family is 88.
Equines
13 more horses have been confirmed positive for West Nile virus:
RM of Springfield(2)
RM of Rosedale
RM of Morton(2)
RM of Lorne(2)
RM of Hanover
RM of Dufferin
RM of Whitehead

The total number of confirmed positive horses in Manitoba is now 99 (10
horses were counted twice and have been removed from the data).
Humans:
There have been no human cases of West Nile virus diagnosed in Manitoba.
The risk of illness for any individual remains low and is diminishing as
the weather gets colder. New populations of mosquitoes are less likely to
be infected at this time of year.
The province's summer bird surveillance program will come to an end on Fri
27 Sep 2002. Surveillance of West Nile virus in horses will continue until
mid-October. Surveillance of West Nile virus in humans will continue.
