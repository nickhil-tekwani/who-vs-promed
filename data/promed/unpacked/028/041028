Madagascan health officials said they fear a outbreak of an incurable
crippling mosquito-borne disease that has ravaged the nearby Indian
Ocean island of Reunion.
Dozens of people showing possible symptoms of the viral infection
known as "chikungunya" have flocked to the main hospital on the
island's second city of Toamasina since last week, prompting
authorities to test for the illness.
"The patients have fever but I cannot yet say whether they are
suffering from malaria or chikungunya, it is just a suspicion," said
Dr Givance, the hospital chief.
Roland Rajonson, the secretary general of Madagascar's health
ministry, told AFP that physicians from the capital had been sent to
Toamasina on the east coast to look into the matter and would report
back by the end of the week.
"Yesterday (Tuesday) [31 Jan 2006], we deployed a team of doctors to
the ground to investigate whether there were real cases of
chikungunya," he said.
"To be really sure it is chikungunya, we must analyze blood samples,"
said Jean Marc Reynes, a virologist in Antananarivo.
Chikungunya is Swahili for "that which bends up" and refers to the
stooped posture of those afflicted by the crippling and extremely
painful disease for which there is no known vaccine or cure.
It is characterized by high fever and severe rashes, and while
non-fatal in itself and most people eventually recover, it can
provide opportunities for other diseases to set in.
Chikungunya outbreaks have sparked deep concerns in the French
overseas territory of Reunion, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) east
of Madagascar, where at least 30 000 people are thought to have been
taken ill since March [2005].
The disease is suspected of having been a contributory cause of death
in 4 people in their nineties.
Officials there estimate that 5000 new cases have occurred since
mid-January 2006, prompting the French authorities to assign 400 more
troops to efforts to combat the mosquitos that are spreading the virus.
Authorities in Reunion have delayed the beginning of the new school
term in order to decontaminate [fumigate] schools and the island's
tourism industry has expressed concern that the outbreak could hurt business.

[Confirmatory laboratory testing is pending. In this part of Africa,
chikungunya and o'nyong-nyong -- which show similar fever and joint
pains -- are equally possible. The 2 diseases are caused by 2
distinct members of the genus Alphavirus, family Togaviridae. - Mod. RY]
[It appears as though this may be a significant year for chikungunya
virus activity in the Indian Ocean islands off the east coast of
Africa (see
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/africa_ref_2005.pdf> for a map
of the region. In April 2005 there was activity reported in the
Comoros, in May 2005 there were reports in Reunion and Mauritius
where chikungunya activity has continued with thousands of cases
reported (see prior ProMED-mail postings below). As the Comoros are
to the west of Madagascar and Reunion and Mauritius are to the east,
a straight line from the Comoros to both Reunion and Mauritius passes
through Madagascar. More information on the laboratory and
epidemiologic investigations of this outbreak in Madagascar would be
appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
