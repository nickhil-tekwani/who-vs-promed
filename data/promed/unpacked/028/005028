Shandong releases November [2015] infectious disease report: 29 people died of AIDS, etc.

Shandong Health & Family Planning Commission has released a report on the occurrence of legally-defined infectious diseases throughout the province. Province-wide, there were 10 508 cases of 17 kinds of class B infectious diseases with 29 deaths. Deaths were caused by AIDS, tuberculosis, rabies, hemorrhagic fever, hepatitis B, and measles.

The report showed that there were no reports of Class A Legally-Defined Infectious Diseases in the province.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Dan Silver

[This report does not indicate how many of the cases or the deaths are due to hemorrhagic fever (HF), or the specific pathogens responsible for the HF. There are several possible etiologies of the reported hemorrhagic disease cases that could be caused by a variety of viruses such as hantaviruses, including Hantaan virus and Seoul virus, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, for example. Bacteria could be involved as well.

ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the pathogens responsible for these cases of hemorrhagic disease.

Interestingly, there was a recent, similar report of HF cases in Shaanxi province that also did not indicate which pathogens might be involved in HF cases (see ProMED-mail archive no 20151207.3844900).
