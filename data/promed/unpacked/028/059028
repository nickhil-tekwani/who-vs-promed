Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease in Cattle, Western Turkey
-------------------------------------------------------
Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) is a
member of the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae,
and is closely related to bluetongue virus (BTV).
EHD often causes death in white-tailed deer and,
less frequently, a bluetongue-like illness in cattle.

EHDV has been isolated from cattle throughout the
world, including Africa, North America,
Australia, Japan, and recently Israel. Recent
outbreaks of EHDV in Israel during 2006 were
attributed to EHDV-7; outbreaks in Morocco and
Algeria were similar to EHDV-6/EHDV-318. An
initial suspicion of EHD, based on observation of
clinical signs, can be confirmed by virus
isolation and characterization, nucleic acid
identification, or serologic testing. ELISA is a
specific and sensitive method for detecting
EHDV-specific antigens or antibodies and confirming the disease.

In July 2007, a 7-week outbreak of disease in
cattle began in Mugla, Turkey. The disease was
regarded as unusual or atypical for the region,
and cases were reported to the Uludag University
Faculty of Veterinary Medicine. Similar reports
were also received from Izmir, Canakkale, and
Istanbul through the end of August 2007. The
cattle had stomatitis, swelling of eyelids,
respiratory distress, nasal and ocular discharge,
redness and scaling of muzzle and lips, lameness,
and udder erythema, and some were recumbent. Body
temperatures were elevated (39.7 DEGC­41.1 DEGC
[]), except for 1 animal, whose temperature was
37.5 DEGC, below the reference range for cattle
(37.8 DEGC­39.2 DEGC). However, heart rates (mean
72 plus or minus 3 beats/min) and respiratory
rates (mean 24 plus or minus 4 breaths/min) were
within reference ranges of 60­80 beats/min and
10­30 breaths/min, respectively, for cattle with
suspected disease. Cattle with EHD had
tachycardia and tachypnea. Causes of mucosal
disease, stomatitis, and fever, including bovine
viral diarrhea, foot and mouth disease, and
infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, were
considered, but the rate of spread and some of
the clinical signs ruled out these diseases.
However, the clinical signs of the disease were
consistent with either EHD or BTV infection.
These diseases were therefore considered as
requiring further laboratory-based diagnostic assays.

A total of 41 blood samples were obtained from
the affected cattle (35 Holsteins and 6 Brown
Swiss, 2­5 years of age). Samples were obtained
in tubes with and without EDTA. Complete blood
analysis showed that 5 of the cattle with EHD had
low leukocyte counts. After use for hematologic
analysis, samples were stored at ­30 DEGC until
virologic and serologic tests could be performed.
Samples from the 41 animals were tested by ELISA
for bovine viral diarrhea virus antigens; results
were negative. To isolate virus, we spread
unclotted blood samples onto baby hamster kidney­21 (BHK) cells.

Because EHDV had never been observed in Turkey,
no diagnostic procedures were available. We
therefore submitted selected samples (11 whole
blood samples, 4 serum samples, and 15
supernatant samples from the BHK cells) to the
World Organisation for Animal Health reference
laboratory for BTV (Institute for Animal Health,
Pirbright, UK) for virologic and serologic
analysis. All samples were tested for BTV by
real-time RT-PCR and for EHDV by conventional
RT-PCR. All results were negative for BTV.
However, a conventional RT-PCR assay targeting
genome segment 7 of EHDV indicated that one of
the cell culture supernatants, from an early case
from Mugla, was positive for EHDV; this cow died
3 hours after clinical examination and sample
collection. The remaining cell culture
supernatants were negative for EHDV. It is
unusual to isolate EHDV by direct inoculation of
BHK cells; initial passage through eggs or the
Culicoides variipennis larvae cell line (KC
cells) is usually required. The 4 serum samples
were also tested for EHDV-specific antibodies by
ELISA; only 1 sample was found to contain antibodies to EHDV.

Conventional RT-PCR of RNA extracted from the 11
original blood samples gave inconclusive results.
Agarose gel electrophoresis indicated no product
of the expected size. However, virus was isolated
from 6 of the blood samples by using KC cells
(dsRNA virus reference collection at the
Institute for Animal Health, reference collection
nos. TUR2007/01-06). These 6 samples and the 1
original positive cell culture were further
tested by serotype-specific RT-PCRs that targeted
segment 2 for identification of EHDV serotype.
This analysis identified all viruses as EHDV-6,
sharing 95.7 percent nucleotide sequence identity
(segment 2, 110­670 bp) with the EHDV reference strain 318.

Conclusions
-----------
Of the selected samples submitted for BTV and
EHDV testing, the positive identification of EHDV
RNA supports initial clinical identification of
an EHD outbreak in Turkey. The negative results
from the blood samples may have resulted from
degradation of viral RNA during transfer to the
laboratory or insufficient sensitivity in the
conventional RT-PCR. The propagation of another 6
virus isolates (TUR2007/01­06) by passage through
KC cells indicates that virus was indeed present
in the original blood samples, although not detected by conventional RT-PCR.

That only one of the 4 original serum samples was
positive for EHDV antibodies by ELISA can be
explained by time of sample collection.
Antibodies to BTV can be detected from 8 days
after infection; these samples may have been
collected during the early stages of infection,
before development of the immune response.

This study confirms EHDV infection of cattle in
Turkey. EHD needs to be considered in the
differential diagnosis of cattle with clinical
signs that include fever; stomatitis; lameness;
salivation; redness and scaling of the nose and
lips; swelling of the tongue; and erosions of the
pulvinus dentalis, palatinum, and nose. More
detailed studies of EHDV infection in cattle are needed.

[On 22 May 2008, ProMED-mail posted the following
request for information: "We have been informed
from a reliable source that during the 2nd
semester of 2007, clinical cases of a disease
suspected to be epizootic hemorrhagic disease
(EHD) have been described in cattle in several
locations in the Eastern Mediterranean. Further
information, in particular clinical description,
epidemiological data, and laboratory results are
urgently requested". This was kindly responded to by
Dr Ethem Temizel on 6 Jun 2008, informing about
"cases of a disease clinically suspected as EHD
between early July and the last week of August
2007 in several cities on the western part of
Turkey." He further indicated that all the
submitted samples gave negative results for
bluetongue and that laboratory tests of samples
originating from the Mugla and Canakkale
provinces were indicative of EHDV etiology,
adding that their details, and full description
of the observations, "are included in a paper
submitted for publication."

ProMED-mail remarked
that the paper was anticipated with great
interest, particularly the laboratory test
results. These have indeed become available due
to the publication of the above paper which
includes, among others, the expected information
on the serotyping of the Turkish EHD isolate. The
2007 isolate from Turkey has been serotyped at
Pirbright as "EHDV-6, sharing 95.7 percent
nucleotide sequence identity (segment 2, 110­670
bp) with the EHDV reference strain 318."

Interesting data on EHD isolates from the
Mediterranean basin are available in the table
"Isolates of Epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus
(EHDV) in the dsRNA virus collection at IAH
Pirbright", available on the web-site of the IAH, Pirbright at
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/EHDV-isolates.ht>.
Under "untyped, 2004" the table presents one
isolate from Morocco ("MOR2004/03") with the
remark "Initial typing suggested 318 or type 6".
This strain, apparently resembling the Turkish
virus of 2007, was sampled in 2004 in Morocco,
close to the Algerian border, between Er-Rachidia
and Bou Arfa, where 14 clinical cases with 3
mortalities were seen in cattle that were co-habitant with healthy sheep.

Under "untyped, 2006", the table presents 13
isolates from Morocco and 9 isolates from Israel.
However, 2 of the 2006 isolates from the Maghreb
have been typed and are presented as serotype 9.
One of them is from Morocco (MOR2006/5) and one from Algeria (ALG2006/02).

Under "Serotype 6" the table presents 7 isolates
from Turkey, 2007. The other EHD-6 strains in the
collection are from the USA (2006) and Australia (1981).

The affected areas in western Turkey, along the
Aegean sea, are adjacent to European territories
(eg the Greek island Lesbos [Lesvos], where another
culicoides-borne orbivirus, BTV-16, has
currently caused a serious outbreak). This
geographic proximity will become apparent from the map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=7487>.

EHD, an emerging disease in cattle, has been
added to OIE's list of notifiable diseases since
May 2008, following the outbreaks in 4
Mediterranean countries. All OIE member countries
will have to report its presence/absence in
their annual reports for 2008, now due. The issue
deserves to be addressed by the animal health
agencies in the Mediterranean basin and
south-east Europe. To the best of our knowledge,
no vaccines are yet available against this orbivirus.
