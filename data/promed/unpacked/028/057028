Queensland health experts are concerned after 2 cases of drug-resistant gonorrhea were identified amid a surge in overall cases.

The overall cases of the sexually transmitted infection [STI] have more than doubled since 2014, when 2276 cases were recorded. This year, 4920 cases were identified.

Dr Amy Jennison, acting chief scientist of Public Health Microbiology, Forensic and Scientific Services (FSS) Queensland Health, said the strain of extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea (XDR) was alarming.

"These XDR gonorrhoea cases will not respond to the current Australian recommended treatment," Jennison said in a statement on Tuesday [12 Nov 2019]. "So these patients have to be given specialised antibiotics that require hospitalisation and IV."

Although the cases of XDR gonorrhea are sporadic, Jennison said the overall increase was a concern. "What concerns us most is that we continuing to see an increase in the total number of cases here in Queensland each year," she said.

The patterns of the STI in Queensland were also changing. "Gonorrhoea used to be only generally associated with groups practising high-risk, unprotected sexual practices, but now we see it expanding into the rest of the population," Jennison said. "Ages are increasing, and we're seeing it in our heterosexual population, including older women. "Previously we rarely saw cases in older women, but we are now seeing older Queenslanders presenting with gonorrhoea."

Gonorrhea can lead to fertility issues in both men and women and can infect the anus, rectum, mouth, throat, and eyes. "It is important that all sexually active people are aware of safe sexual practices," Jennison said.

[The rising incidence of syphilis and gonorrhea has become a problem in many countries worldwide. The reasons for the increase in incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are varied and likely differ by locality and the patient population affected. Increased diagnostic testing for STDs could contribute, to some extent, to the increased incidence in some groups, such as men who have sex with men (MSM). Some of the factors that could promote unprotected (condomless) sex include lack of sex education and access to condoms for teenagers and young adults; the opioid epidemic and sale of sex for drugs; the popularity of cell phone geolocating dating apps that facilitate sexual activity with multiple anonymous partners; use of internet chat rooms to meet sex partners; use of psychoactive "party drugs"; and use among MSM of pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis, or PrEP, which is a way to prevent HIV infection for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it by engaging in risky condomless sexual activity (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/factsheets/prep101-consumer-info.pdf).

The increasing incidence of gonococcal disease has been associated with increasing reports of antibiotic-resistant strains. Antimicrobial resistance in _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, the cause of gonococcal disease, has developed to all previous drugs, such as sulfonamides, penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and cefixime, as each drug was introduced in recommended treatment regimens, leaving limited options at present. Dual empiric therapy with the expanded-spectrum cephalosporin ceftriaxone plus azithromycin is currently recommended by the US CDC and the WHO, but many countries have seen decreasing susceptibility to these drugs. The 2 cases of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) _N. gonorrhoeae_ infection in Australia mentioned in the news report above are likely the same cases reported in 2018 and posted at the time by ProMED-mail (Gonococcal disease: UK, Australia, antibiotic resist. ceftriaxone/azithro. ECDC, archive no. 20180515.5798557). However, the specific drug susceptibilities for the pathogens in these 2 cases are not given, except to say that these strains would not respond to the current Australian recommended treatment (ceftriaxone and azithromycin).

According to the ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/portal/files/documents/RRA-Gonorrhoea,%20Antimicrobial%20resistance-United%20Kingdom,%20Australia.pdf), multidrug resistant (MDR)-_N. gonorrhoeae_ has been defined as strains resistant to one of an injectable or oral extended-spectrum cephalosporins or spectinomycin and at least 2 of the following antibiotic classes: penicillins, fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems. Extensively drug resistant (XDR)-_N. gonorrhoeae_ has been defined as strains resistant to 2 or more of the injectable or oral extended-spectrum cephalosporins or spectinomycin and 3 or more of the following antibiotic classes: penicillins, fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems. (See Tapsall JW, Ndowa F, Lewis DA, Unemo M.: Meeting the public health challenge of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_. Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2009; 7(7): 821-34. DOI: 10.1586/eri.09.63.)

Isolates resistant to ceftriaxone have been reported worldwide, for example in Japan, France, Spain, and Australia (see http://aac.asm.org/content/60/7/4339.long). The 1st 3 cases of infection with XDR-_N. gonorrhoeae_ displaying resistance to ceftriaxone and high-level resistance to azithromycin were reported by the United Kingdom (one case) and Australia (2 cases) in February and March 2018, respectively. The case from the UK and one case from Australia were travel associated, and both acquired gonorrhea in Southeast Asia. - Mod.ML
