I read the original posting [White-nose syndrome, bats - USA:
(Northeast) 20080219.0675] about the white-nose syndrome affecting
bats in Dorset cave and the subsequent response from Dr. Hasle on
2-20-08 [White-nose syndrome, bats - USA (02): (Northeast)
20080220.0687].

Does Dorset cave have ticks? If so, our laboratory is geared up to do
nested PCR analysis for Anaplasma as he suggests and we could do a
quick screen of a dozen or so ticks to see if _Anaplasma sp._ is
infecting ticks in that cave. Ticks collected from dead bats would be
preferable if ticks truly exist there.
