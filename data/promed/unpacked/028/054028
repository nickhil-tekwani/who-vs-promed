Fifth new variant CJD victim in "cluster"
-------------------------------------------
QUENIBOROUGH: A fifth person has died of suspected new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD) in a small area of Leicestershire. The
man, who died on the evening of 28 Sep 2000 after months of illness, is
believed to have been a farm worker with links to the village of
Queniborough, just north of Leicester. The village is being investigated by
the Department of Health over its high incidence of new variant CJD - the
human form of "mad cow disease" (BSE) - after 4 people living within a
5-mile radius of each other, died of the disease. Their interim findings
will be presented to doctors at the health authority at the beginning of
November.
A report into the government's handling of BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) will be published later this month. Experts investigating
the village are looking to see if people in the area are more susceptible
to the disease. The Leicestershire nvCJD "cluster" was first reported in
November 1998, after it claimed 3 lives within 12 weeks in 1998. A 35 year
old man from Queniborough, and a 24 year old woman from nearby Glenfield,
died in October. A 19 year old woman, formerly of Queniborough, had died 2
months earlier in August. A 19-year-old man died from the disease in May at
the Leicester Royal Infirmary and, at the time, health officials said it
was "highly probable" that a 24-year-old man in the county had also
contracted it.
The investigation into the Leicestershire cluster includes a large team of
officials from bodies such as the National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh. They are working with the Department of Health and the Ministry
of Agriculture. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the
official body monitoring the progress of the disease, said in July [2000
there were 69 known victims of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (vCJD) in
the UK. The disease can only be identified with absolute certainty after
death. "The number of cases reported now indicates a statistically
significant rising trend of around 20-30% per annum to date," the spokesman
said.
