[1] Ganoderma - Malaysia: (Sabah), emerging disease

The East Malaysia Planters' Association (Empa) said a relatively new
disease named Ganoderma is causing considerable damage to the palm
oil industry in Sabah. Its Chairman, Othman Walat, said more than 35
percent of the palms could be killed by the disease. "Yield losses as
high as 46 percent have been reported here," he said.

Othman said oil palm is an important crop to the country and in Sabah
it still remains the top export earner. He said Ganoderma could
seriously affect the revenue of the industry, Federal and State
governments. "But in view of the fact that the disease is relatively
new to East Malaysia, there is a need for more research and extension
work," he said. One of the few proven methods for Ganoderma
management is by sanitation measures during replanting. He said it is
crucial to avoid cultural practices that will aggravate the situation.

"The rapid expansion of the industry over here means there are many
who may not be aware of this potential time bomb in their
plantations," he said. Empa supports the Government's balanced
approach of not only emphasising profit but also contribute to social
responsibility.

[2] Bud rot - Colombia

In Puerto Wilches, Colombia, Edgar Barrera, superintendent of the
Bucarelia company's 12 000 acre oil palm grove, speaks of the palms'
death sentence. "What we have is a technological, economic and social
disaster."

He is referring to a mysterious, fast-spreading and deadly disease
called "PC" [bud rot] that has devastated oil palm plantations in
Colombia. More than 60 percent of Bucarelia's palms are dead or dying
because of it, and PC has destroyed more than half a million of his
company's trees, he said.

It's not just huge plantations that are suffering. A farmer who
plowed his life's savings into a 35 acre grove that was once highly
profitable is still coming to grips with the disaster. Since he first
noted signs of PC in 2007, the plague has killed 1200 of his 2000
trees. The surviving palms' days are numbered, he said.

The ravages of PC go beyond agriculture; the damage extends to
Colombia's drug fighting and energy policies. By decimating palm
groves, the disease is eliminating an alternative crop to coca,
cocaine's raw material, which is illegally grown in abundance
hereabout. It could also impede the government's mandate that by 2015
20 percent of all fuel burned by trucks and buses be made with
biofuels.

Fedepalma, the association of Colombian palm farmers, has mounted a
disease management program centering on hybrids.

[Ganoderma
-----------
Ganoderma disease (also called butt rot, basal stem rot) of African
oil palm (_Elaeis guineensis_) is caused by the fungus _Ganoderma
orbiforme_ (previously _G. boninense_). The pathogen can affect a
range of palms and is also important in coconut palm cultivation.
Other _Ganoderma_ species have also been reported occasionally in
association with the disease. Ganoderma is considered the most
destructive disease of oil palms in southeast Asia, where it causes
severe losses, but is also significant in African countries.

Symptoms include pale young foliage, chlorosis and necrosis of older
fronds, wilting and reduced growth. By the time foliar symptoms
appear, over half of the lower internal trunk tissue has usually been
killed off, and fruiting bodies emerge soon after. Disease
development depends on environmental factors including climate, soil
and humidity. The fungus is soil-borne and is also spread by aerial
spores, with infected plant and other materials, and by mechanical
means (such as human activities). Disease management relies on
cultural measures and phytosanitation. Fruiting bodies are not fit
for human consumption, but other _Ganoderma_ species are being used
in some health care products.

In Malaysia, spread of the disease was reported from oil palm
plantations on the mainland in 2006 (ProMED-mail post 20060301.0661),
but now the disease appears to have become a serious problem also in
Malaysia's Borneo states.

Bud rot
-------
Bud rot is one of the worst diseases of palms. In Latin America, tens
of thousands of hectares of oil palms are affected with entire
estates destroyed in Panama, Colombia, Suriname, Brazil and Ecuador,
and the disease is the limiting factor for oil palm cultivation in
the region. The fungus-like organism _Phytophthora palmivora_ as well
as other pathogens (including other _Phytophthora_ species),
secondary insect infestations and possibly also environmental factors
are thought to be involved.

_P. palmivora_ is known to affect more than 150 tropical hosts. It
also causes, for example, black pod of cocoa and is the main pathogen
of bud rot of coconut and other palms in southeast Asia. In palms,
symptoms start with discolouration of the spear leaf followed by
extensive frond rots as the infected leaf unfolds. The rot progresses
into the leaf base killing the single growing bud and thus eventually
the tree. Disease incidence is usually more severe in high humidity.

The fungus is spread by insects, mechanical means, plant debris,
rain, and wind, and can remain dormant in the leaf base during dry
conditions. Disease management includes cultural practices
(phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and
burning of severely affected palms, and fungicide treatments at or
before onset of symptoms. New strains that spread faster and cannot
be controlled by these measures are emerging. Breeding programmes
using possible bud rot resistance genes from _Elaeis oleifera_
(indigenous to the Americas) are in progress.

In Colombia, the disease is reported to severely affect small scale
oil palm growers (ProMED-mail post 20091127.4067) and, therefore, the
potential for employment of economically disadvantaged villagers as
farm workers in rural areas.
