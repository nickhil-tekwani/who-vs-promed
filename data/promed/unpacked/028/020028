[1] Antibody against variants
Date: Mon 7 Jun 2021

Levels of antibodies in the blood of vaccinated people that are able to recognise and fight the new SARS-CoV-2 delta variant first discovered in India (B.1.617.2) are on average lower than those against previously circulating variants in the UK, according to new laboratory data from the Francis Crick Institute and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) UCLH Biomedical Research Centre [and] published as a Research letter in The Lancet.

The results also show that levels of these antibodies are lower with increasing age and that levels decline over time, providing additional evidence in support of plans to deliver a vaccination boost to vulnerable people in the autumn.

And the researchers support current plans to reduce the dose gap between vaccines since they found that after just one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, people are less likely to develop antibody levels against the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant as high as those seen against the previously dominant B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant, first found in Kent.

Although laboratory results such as these are needed to provide a guide as to how the virus might be evolving to escape the 1st generation of vaccines, levels of antibodies alone do not predict vaccine effectiveness, and prospective population studies are also needed. Lower neutralising antibody levels may still be associated with protection against COVID-19.

This is the largest study published to date investigating vaccine-induced antibody neutralising capacity against the newest variants of concern in healthy adults. Researchers have submitted their findings to the Genotype-to-Phenotype National Virology Consortium (G2P-UK), the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) as evidence of the level of protection people might receive against the new variants after one dose and both doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

As part of the SARS-CoV-2 Legacy study, led by the Crick and partners at UCL and University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UCLH), healthcare workers and staff from the institutions have been donating regular blood and swab samples so that researchers can track changing risk of infection and response to vaccination.

Thanks to samples of the latest variants of concern being provided by NHS labs to the G2P-UK consortium, researchers have been able to quickly assess the potential risks they might pose.

Within just a few days of having enough of each variant to study, they were able to analyse antibodies in the blood of 250 healthy people who received either one or 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, up to 3 months after their 1st dose. Using a new highly accurate high-throughput viral neutralisation assay developed at the Crick, they tested the ability of antibodies to block entry of the virus into cells, so called 'neutralising antibodies,' against 5 different variants of SARS-CoV-2:

- The original strain first discovered in Wuhan, China
- The dominant strain in Europe during the 1st wave in April 2020 (D614G)
- B.1.1.7, the variant first discovered in Kent, UK (alpha)
- B.1.351, the variant first discovered in South Africa (beta)
- B.1.617.2, the newest variant of concern, first discovered in India (delta)

They then compared concentrations of these neutralising antibodies between all variants. Data from previous clinical studies suggests that higher antibody titres (the greatest dilution level that still blocks 50% of virus infection in the lab) is a good predictor of vaccine efficacy and greater protection against COVID-19.

They found that in people who had been fully vaccinated with 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, levels of neutralising antibodies were more than 5 times lower against the B.1.617.2 variant when compared to the original strain, upon which current vaccines are based.

Importantly, this antibody response was even lower in people who had only received one dose. After a single dose of Pfizer-BioNTech, 79% of people had a quantifiable neutralising antibody response against the original strain, but this fell to 50% for B.1.1.7, 32% for B.1.617.2, and 25% for B.1.351.

While antibody levels decreased with age against all variants, no correlation was observed for sex or BMI.

The study participants analysed here had all been vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. More work is underway to test neutralising antibodies against these same variants in people who have been vaccinated with the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

Emma Wall, UCLH Infectious Diseases consultant and Senior Clinical Research Fellow for the Legacy study, said: "This virus will likely be around for some time to come, so we need to remain agile and vigilant. Our study is designed to be responsive to shifts in the pandemic so that we can quickly provide evidence on changing risk and protection.

"The most important thing is to ensure that vaccine protection remains high enough to keep as many people out of hospital as possible. And our results suggest that the best way to do this is to quickly deliver 2nd doses and provide boosters to those whose immunity may not be high enough against these new variants."

David LV Bauer, group leader of the Crick's RNA Virus Replication Laboratory and member of the G2P-UK National Virology Consortium, said: "New variants occur naturally and those that have an advantage will spread. We now have the ability to quickly adapt our vaccination strategies to maximise protection where we know people are most vulnerable.

"Keeping track of these evolutionary changes is essential for us to retain control over the pandemic and return to normality. This work is a powerful example of effective collaborations between NHS and academic colleagues, that can help us to navigate changes in this new phase of the pandemic."

Conclusions.
". . . In the case of single-dose recipients, our data show that NAbTs are significantly lower against B.1.617.2 and B.1.351 VOCs relative to B.1.1.7, implying that although a single dose might still afford considerably more protection than no vaccination, single-dose recipients are likely to be less protected against these SARS-CoV-2 variants. These data therefore suggest that the benefits of delaying the 2nd dose, in terms of wider population coverage and increased individual NAbTs after the 2nd dose, (7) must now be weighed against decreased efficacy in the short-term, in the context of the spread of B.1.617.2. Worldwide, our data highlight the ongoing need to increase vaccine supply to allow all countries to extend 2nd-dose protection as quickly as possible.

"In the longer term, we note that both increased age and time since the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 significantly correlate with decreased NAb activity against B.1.617.2 and B.1.351, both of which are also characteristic of the population in the UK at highest risk of severe COVID-19 (i.e., older and vaccinated earlier), independent of other existing factors such as compromised immune status or comorbidity, or geographic-specific responses to vaccination." - Mod.LK]

[2] Delta variant: symptoms
Date: Fri 11 Jun 2021

The delta variant appears to cause different coronavirus symptoms to what we're used to, which are more reminiscent of a bad cold, according to the lead researcher behind the Zoe COVID Symptom Study.

Professor Tim Spector, an expert in genetic epidemiology from King's College London (KCL), said the variant, which first originated in India and has now become the most dominant variant in the UK, "is more like a bad cold" in the younger population, and "people don't realise that."

The NHS website still lists the 3 classic symptoms -- a high temperature, new and continuous cough, and loss or change to smell and/or taste -- as the main symptoms of the virus.

In his weekly debrief, Prof Spector said increases in cases appear to be in the young and unvaccinated, with most cases under 40 years old.

This tallies up with Public Health England (PHE) statistics published on 10 Jun [2021], which revealed case rates have increased in most age groups this past week, with infections now highest in those aged 20-29.

Data suggests the delta variant has an R rate of 6, which is about twice as transmissible as the original variant. That's "really infectious," said Prof Spector.

People who are fully vaccinated can still catch this variant, although it's likely they'll have a milder version and won't need to be hospitalised.

"COVID is acting differently now," said Prof Spector, citing the symptom change. "This means that people might think they've just got some sort of seasonal cold, and they still go out to parties and they might spread it around to 6 other people. We think this is fuelling a lot of the problem."

Since the start of May [2021], his team has been analysing the symptoms submitted by all app users and have noticed they're not the same as they once were.

The number-one symptom now is headache, followed by sore throat, runny nose, and fever, "all those are not the old classic symptoms," said Prof Spector.

"[Symptom] number 5 is cough; it's rarer, and we don't even see loss of smell coming into the top 10 anymore. This variant seems to be working slightly differently."

He said young people might get symptoms that "feel like a bad cold or some funny 'off' feeling," and added those who do should stay home and order a lateral flow test. If the test result is positive, get a PCR test to be sure, he explained. You can find out more about getting tested for COVID on the NHS website.

"If you feel unwell, just stay at home for a few days until it passes," he concluded.

Discussing the latest rise in cases, Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, urged people to remember it's safer to meet outside. "Practise good hand hygiene and wear face coverings in enclosed spaces," she added.

[3A] CDC-led study finds major racial disparities in MIS-C incidence

A surveillance study of US children during the 1st wave of the pandemic found that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was a rare complication associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but incidence was significantly higher in non-White racial and ethnic groups, US researchers reported yesterday [Thu 10 Jun 2021] in JAMA Network Open.

Using enhanced surveillance data collected from 7 states (Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) from April through June 2020, a team led by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Response Team found that 248 people under age 21 with MIS-C were reported, with the most in New Jersey. The median age range at onset was 8, and 53.6% of the cases were male.

Overall incidence of MIS-C during the study period was 5.1 persons per 1 million person-months. Compared with White persons, incidence was about 9-fold higher among Black persons (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR], 9.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.15 to 13.93) and Hispanic or Latino persons (aIRR, 8.92; 95% CI, 6.0 to 13.26), and nearly 3-fold higher among Asian or Pacific Islanders (aIRR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.49 to 5.92).

MIS-C incidence was 316 per 1 million SARS-CoV-2 infections and was also higher among Black (aIRR, 5.62; 95% CI, 3.68 to 8.60), Hispanic or Latino (aIRR, 4.26; 95% CI, 2.85 to 6.38), and Asian or Pacific Islander persons (aIRR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.42 to 5.38) compared with White persons. For both analyses, incidence was highest among children aged 5 years or younger and children aged 6-10 years.

"Our findings of higher incidence among younger children and among Hispanic or Latino, Black, and Asian or Pacific Islander persons emphasize a need for further study of risk factors for MIS-C," the study authors wrote.

Conclusions
". . . This cohort study estimated incidence of MIS-C in select jurisdictions during April to June 2020. These estimates indicated that MIS-C was a rare complication associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in this cohort overall. The estimates and approach in this study provide baseline data prior to implementation of interventions, such as SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for children, allowing for subsequent monitoring of MIS-C as an outcome, as prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection would be expected to reduce incidence of MIS-C. Our findings of higher incidence among younger children and among Hispanic or Latino, Black, and Asian or Pacific Islander persons emphasize a need for further study of risk factors for MIS-C." - Mod.LK]

[3B] Most severe COVID patient autopsies showed muscle inflammation

In autopsies of 43 hospitalized COVID patients and 11 patients hospitalized for other health issues in Germany, those with COVID-19 were associated with more skeletal muscle inflammation, according to a study today [11 Jun 2021] in JAMA Neurology.

The researchers looked at cryopreserved quadriceps, deltoids, lungs, and heart tissues in people who died from March 2020-February 2021. Of those who had COVID-19, the median age was 72, 72.1% were men, and COVID-19 infection was the primary cause of death in 83.7%. Those without COVID infection had a median age of 71, and 63.6% were men. All but one in the COVID-19 group had at least one concurrent medical issue, but none had a history of primary myopathy, or disease affecting muscle tissue.

Overall, 60.4% of COVID-19 patients had some sort of muscle inflammation, with more severe inflammation associated with those who were chronically ill with COVID-19 (30 or more days post-symptom onset) and then seroconverted. Patients with COVID-19 had skeletal muscles with higher overall pathology scores (average, 3.4 vs 1.5) and inflammation scores (average, 3.5 vs 1.0) compared with those without, and their natural killer cell levels were higher (median, 8 vs 3 per 10 high-power fields).

While SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in some muscles of COVID-19 patients, the researchers say there was no evidence for direct viral infection and that its presence is most likely explained by circulating viral RNA.

"Most individuals with severe COVID-19 showed signs of myositis ranging from mild to severe. Inflammation of skeletal muscles was associated with the duration of illness and was more pronounced than cardiac inflammation," write the researchers. "This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a postinfectious, immune-mediated myopathy."

Conclusions
". . . In this case-control study of patients who had died with and without COVID-19, most individuals with severe COVID-19 showed signs of myositis ranging from mild to severe. SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a postinfectious myositis in patients with severe illness. Whether these findings can be extrapolated to milder disease courses and potentially explain chronic muscle fatigue syndromes as described in postacute COVID-19 syndromes and whether autoimmune mechanisms are involved will need to be addressed in future studies." - Mod.LK]

[4] India (Bihar): COVID deaths revised
Date: Thu 10 Jun 2021 3:44 p.m. IST
Source: NDTV [edited]
https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-bihar-revises-covid-deaths-by-72-to-more-than-9-000-sets-off-new-row-2460429


Bihar's massive revision in its COVID deaths figure to over 9000 has become controversial, with the 72% jump raising more questions. Because of Bihar's update, India reported 6148 new deaths today [Thu 10 Jun 2021], the highest single-day spike.

The Nitish Kumar government on Wednesday [9 Jun 2021] reported that the number of deaths across the state in the pandemic was 9375 compared to the figure of 5424 earlier.

The Patna High Court had asked for an audit of casualties in the April-May [2021] 2nd surge of COVID amid allegations that the Bihar government was hiding the scale of infections and deaths in the state. Shocking visuals of bodies floating in the river and washing up on the banks near Buxar last month [May 2021] reinforced the opposition's charge.

New figures after the 3-week audit imply that, while 1600 people died of COVID in Bihar between March 2020 and 2021, the number of deaths from April to 7 Jun this year [2021] was a staggering 7775, about 6 times more.

The state's health department said about 72% more had been added after verification from all districts. It gave a break-up from 38 districts but did not specify when these additional deaths took place.

The most deaths, according to the new figures, took place in state capital Patna: 2303. The city also accounted for the highest number of "additional deaths reported after verification."

But records of 3 government-run cremation centres in Patna confirm 3243 "COVID cremations," and the fresh discrepancy is likely to draw more opposition criticism.

According to Pratyay Amrit, Principal Secretary, State Health Department, the difference could be explained by the fact that if a person from another district died in Patna and was cremated here, the death would be counted at the victim's native district and not Patna.

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's native district Nalanda has added 222 deaths.

The state also reported a reduced recovery rate, down from 98.70% to 97.65%.

The state government indicated that the figures could be revised again.
