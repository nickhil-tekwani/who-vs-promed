A fungus that is deadly to many species of amphibians has been found
in wild animals in the UK for the first time. Chytrid fungus is a
major contributor to the decline of amphibian populations around the
world and may have already made one species extinct.
Its presence was detected in a colony of American bullfrogs that had
set up home in a lake in South-East England. Scientists are now
trying to establish whether the fungal disease has spread to native
amphibian species.
The [infection by] _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_ has been found in
captive animals in this country before, but never in the wild.
The chytrid fungus was detected in the bullfrogs by Dr Andrew
Cunningham of the Zoological Society of London.
