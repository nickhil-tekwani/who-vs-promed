["Since the beginning of the 2019 transmission season and as of 11 Jul 2019, no human West Nile virus infection has been reported in EU member states and EU neighboring countries. The 1st equine outbreak has been reported to the Animal Disease Notification System this week in Xanthi, Greece.

"A WNV infected bird has been reported on 10 Jul 2019 in Wittenberg, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany. Last year (2018), West Nile virus (WNV) was detected for the 1st time in resident wild and aviary birds in eastern and south-eastern Germany.

"In accordance with European Commission Directive 2014/110/EU, prospective blood donors should be deferred for 28 days after leaving an area with evidence of WNV circulation among humans unless the results of an individual nucleic acid test are negative."
