The culling of sheep and goats inside the 3-km foot and mouth [FMD]
quarantine area in Dromolaxia will resume today [8 Nov 2007]
following a suspension yesterday to clean and disinfect veterinary equipment.

50 pigs in the same area will also be slaughtered as a precaution,
the Veterinary Services said, as animal farmers called for the
resignation of Agriculture Minister Fotis Fotiou.

Also yesterday [9 Nov 2007], President Tassos Papadopoulos announced
the compensation package for the affected farmers, which includes CP
(Cyprus pounds) 110 [USD 276.10] for each animal culled and CP 75
[USD 188.25] for the loss of income from each animal for the next 6
months, which may be extended.

Over 500 animals have been culled since Monday [5 Nov 2007], and
another 1500 inside the danger zone could be slaughtered to stop any
possible spread of the disease. The orders to continue the cull come
from Brussels.

The farmers will also receive compensation for animal food supplies
that will have to be destroyed and for the expense of reactivating
their stocks. Papadopoulos said the cash measures were effective
immediately and would be completed by Saturday [10 Nov 2007].

However, many of the farmers are still unwilling to accept having
their animals destroyed. During a highly charged meeting in
Dromolaxia yesterday [7 Nov 2007] morning, some of the farmers were
enraged, but others were in tears at the prospect of losing their
livelihood. During the meeting, attended by House President Demetris
Christofias, some angry farmers disputed the results of the tests
carried out in London and denied their animals had FMD. One said that
all of the animals killed up to now did not have the disease and
wondered how it managed to affect sheep and goats when other animals
more prone to the disease, such as cattle, showed no signs at all.

It is believed there are 9 cattle farms inside the affected area,
which have so far come up clear of FMD.

Christofias tried to calm the farmers, saying he sympathised with
their pain, but he said the culling was the decision of the EU not
the Cyprus government. "For better or worse, we are in the EU now,"
he said. "I sympathise with your cries of distress, and I know you
feel as if their animals are like members of your families."

The good news yesterday [7 Nov 2007] was that the 2 EU experts on the
island said the data available so far indicated there was no major
spread of disease and that the quick implementation controls should
be continued so the outbreak could be eradicated as quickly as possible.

"The impression that we have at this moment is that the virus is not
spreading quickly within or between the farms," said EU specialist
Alberto Ladomada.

He did say the measures being taken were precautionary. "I fully urge
all the farmers to fully cooperate with the veterinary authorities of
Cyprus, because to eradicate foot and mouth disease is not an easy
job, and full cooperation of the farmers is really essential," he added.

Meanwhile, yesterday [7 Nov 2007] morning, the slaughterhouse ban was
lifted, and operations resumed at 5 a.m. According to Kofinou's
director Stelios Georgiades, 1500 pigs, 400 sheep and 130 cows were processed.

"We are working normally," he said. Extra measures were also put in
place to check each animal as it arrived to make sure it was healthy,
he said. Only animals from the 3-km exclusion zone, which normally
account for around 1/3rd of the animals sent to Kofinou, were banned.

In addition to the quarantine area, the veterinary services have set
up a 10-km surveillance zone encompassing 10 villages. There are some
150 000 farm animals in that region.

What still needs to be established is how the disease reached Cyprus.
Ladomada said that type O was the strain Cyprus was dealing with.

"We still do not know precisely if there is any relationship between
what is happening here in Cyprus and what has happened in countries
in the region like Egypt; it is too early to say that, so we cannot
assume that there is any relationship between the FMD in Egypt and
what is happening in Cyprus," he said.

Fotiou said that if the strain found in Cyprus turns out to be the
same as the one found in Turkey, then it is most likely that it came
through those channels.

The Cypriot government on Wednesday [7 Nov 2007] approved measures to
support stockbreeders who have been affected by the outbreak of FMD.

"Tackling this problem needs strict measures. We all understand the
sorrow and devastation of the affected stockbreeders, whose livestock
will have to be killed. The problem we face is serious, but the
government will support the animal breeders," said the President
after a cabinet meeting.

The European Commission has labeled Cyprus as a "high risk zone" and
banned the export of Cypriot meat following the FMD outbreak in the
southern Larnaca District. But the ban does not include the famous
Cypriot cheese, halloumi.

European Union experts said that all data collected so far indicates
that the type O virus led to the FMD outbreak in Cyprus. Hundreds of
sheep and goats have been culled so far.

[The event in Cyprus is rather enigmatic. As it appears from the
official OIE notification and from the media, the declaration of an
"outbreak" is based upon serological evidence only. It is not clear
where and when the sheep underwent seroconversion, becoming positive
to FMD virus O.

Other susceptible animals on the same or adjacent premises,
particularly cattle, should be tested as well. If found serologically
negative to FMD, the origin of the positive sheep should be subject
to a thorough investigation. The exclusion of local infection with
FMD may be supported by testing the bovines for bluetongue; if
positive results are obtained, this will strongly indicate that
bluetongue was indeed responsible for the clinical signs observed in
the Dromolaxia sheep during the 2nd half of October 2007. - Mod.AS]
