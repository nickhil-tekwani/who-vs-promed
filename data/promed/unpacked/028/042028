STREPTOCOCCAL ILLNESS DUE TO JERBOAS - EGYPT/USA

No.197 FEBRILE ILLNESS ASSOCIATED WITH HANDLING IMPORTED JERBOAS

--------------------------------

Each year, thousands of exotic animals are imported into the US without
benefit of quarantine. In May and June of 1994, the Texas Department of
Health (TDH) received telephone calls from persons claiming to be ill after
handling jerboas. Large quantities of these rodents had been imported from
Egypt earlier in 1994 to be sold as pets. Many animals died en route or
shortly after arriving in the United States. Necropsies were performed at
eight locations.
Streptococci were cultured from animal tissues at six laboratories; four
identified the isolates as either Group G beta Streptococcus or
Streptococcus equisimilus. We developed a questionnaire and interviewed 93
people from ten states who had handled jerboas. Twenty-two of the 93 met
our case definition. Symptoms included fever (95%), sore throat (91%),
myalgias (68%), diarrhea (59%), cough (59%), and arthralgias (55%).
Thirteen (59%) sought medical attention and received antibiotics.
Case-patients were more likely than controls to have handled sick animals,
68% vs. 27% (Odds ratio = 5.86, 95% Confidence limits = 1.87-19.02), but not
more likely to have been scratched or bitten. This incident demonstrates
that exotic animals may serve as reservoirs for unusual pathogens and
suggests that the exotic animal trade should be regulated.

reptiles (jerboa = boa constrictor!)- Mod.JW]
