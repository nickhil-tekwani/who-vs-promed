[The minister of health, Luis Gome Sambo said on [Tue 25 Apr 2017] in Oihole, Namacunde municipality, Cunene province, that 4 million cases of malaria, which resulted in 15 000 deaths, were recorded in the country's 18 provinces in the last 12 months.]

The head of the health ministry, who was speaking at the central event of World Malaria Day, which is marked today [25 Apr 2017], in spite of the efforts that have been made, malaria continues to be the biggest cause of morbidity and mortality in the country, which affects more children under 5 years and pregnant women.

"In 2016 the country faced an epidemic of malaria, along with yellow fever, dengue, and chikungunya [transmitted by aedes mosquitoes], as a result of rainfall associated with the conditions of sanitation of the environment and difficulty in controlling the vector of the anopheline mosquito [which transmits malaria], whose peculiar density is very high in every country, "he said.

He said that the fight against malaria implies the active participation of communities without exemption and every citizen should feel responsible in the fight against mosquitoes and in case of illness people should seek a health center closer to the diagnosis and correct treatment.

[Malaria is endemic throughout Angola, with an estimated incidence of 120 cases per 1000 population per year (WHO World Malaria Report 2016). All cases are caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_. The malaria burden has gradually increased from an estimated 50 cases per 1000 population in 2005 (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2016/WMR-2016-profiles.pdf). However, reported cases underestimate the real number. The national malaria control program is funded almost entirely by external donors. - Mod.EP
