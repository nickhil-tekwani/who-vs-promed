H3N2 gene study finds flu mutations more predictable than thought
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A study of seasonal H3N2 viruses that circulated from 1968 to 2003 found that mutations were more predictable than previously thought. An international team from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, Russia, and the United States reported their findings in the 22 Nov 2013 issue of Science [abstract reproduced below]. The team looked at genetic sequences of representative H3N2 viruses from 11 antigenic clusters that emerged during the 35-year period, a time that followed the appearance of the strain in humans. Their goal was to pinpoint the substitutions that drove the antigenic changes. They found that at least 9 of 10 cluster transitions were mainly caused by single amino acid substitutions, and all of the substitutions occurred as 7 positions close to the receptor binding site on the hemagglutinin. 5 of the 7 key positions occurred twice.

When they infected ferrets with viruses that contained the single amino acid changes they found differences in virus-specific antibody response. The researchers also found that similar positions drove recent antigenic changes in seasonal H1N1 and influenza B viruses. The findings suggest that nature has selected for substitutions at only 7 of 131 positions that can cause antigenic changes, the team wrote. "This is an important change in our understanding of the antigenic evolution of seasonal influenza viruses." The team also noted that the location of the key positions near the receptor-binding sites provides a clue that antibodies specific to that area play a key role in neutralizing the H3N2 virus.

Researchers noted that it's surprising that antigenic clusters appear relatively slowly, roughly every 3.3 years, given the high mutation rate of flu viruses and the observation that single amino acid substitutions can lead to new antigenic clusters. They suggested that the antigenic changes could come with a fitness cost that slows virus evolution.

Abstract
--------
The molecular basis of antigenic drift was determined for the hemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza A/H3N2 virus. From 1968 to 2003, antigenic change was caused mainly by single amino acid substitutions, which occurred at only 7 positions in HA immediately adjacent to the receptor binding site. Most of these substitutions were involved in antigenic change more than once. Equivalent positions were responsible for the recent antigenic changes of influenza B and A/H1N1 viruses. Substitution of a single amino acid at one of these positions substantially changed the virus-specific antibody response in infected ferrets. These findings have potentially far-reaching consequences for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that govern influenza viruses.

[The Editors added the following comment to put these data in perspective.

"5 antigenic sites in the virus surface hemagglutinin protein, which together comprise 131 amino acid positions, are thought to determine the full scope of antigenic drift of influenza A virus. Koel et al show that major antigenic change can be caused by single amino acid substitutions. These single substitutions substantially skew the way the immune system "sees" the virus. All substitutions of importance are located next to the receptor-binding site in the hemagglutinin. Because there are few positions of importance for antigenic drift, there are strict biophysical limitations to the substitutions at these positions, which restricts the number of new antigenic drift variants at any point in time. Thus, the evolution of influenza virus may be more predictable than previously thought." - Mod.CP']
