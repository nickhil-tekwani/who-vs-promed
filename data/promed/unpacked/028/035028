This is a response to Moderator CHC's reference to Martin Hugh-Jones'
observations that imply an association between predatory and/or scavenging
birds and West Nile virus (WNV).
Only three of the 18 species mentioned in that note do not qualify:
Yellow-billed Cuckoo, Rock Dove, and American Robin. Even so, the Cuckoo
and Robin are insectivorous. [Let's exclude the captive birds from this
discussion. They can't go to their food, it is brought to them. My (very
casual) assumption is that these birds would acquire WNV from mosquitoes
breeding nearby. In any event, there should be pools of water in close
association with any exhibits of Sandhill Cranes, Laughing Gulls,
Black-crowned Night-herons and Mallards.
Of the birds fitting the traditional description of birds of prey, there
are only 4 non-captive species: the three hawks and the kestrel (a small
falcon). Certainly nestlings would be among the prey of these species, (as
CHC suggested) but not as a significant part of their diets. In any event,
nesting in the New York/New Jersey/Connecticut area is mostly finished by
the end of July. Birds do make up a significant part of the diet of the
Cooper's Hawk, but not of the other hawks. These feed mainly on rodents,
small amphibians, and (especially the kestrel) insects.
If there is any real significance to the presence of WNV in hawks, one
might then want to examine their typical prey. My understanding is that
small mammals / rodents are not known to be a large part of the natural
life cycle of WNV, although these species may be infected. Perhaps some
North American rodent is particularly susceptible?
I believe WNV has been found in some amphibians as well. Amphibians are
prey to night-herons, crows, some hawks, and probably the kingfisher.
But if we assume that mosquitoes are the primary means of spreading the
disease among the avian community, then perhaps we should look at what
birds might have been infected. These should include inhabitants of marshy
areas. Such birds are unlikely to be found moribund because of the general
inaccessibility of these areas.
Consider, too, that migratory species begin transiting that area in July
and continue through September or even later. Many birds may have acquired
WNV, then perished in transit due to the combined effects of the infection
and the stresses of migration. This process would dilute the reservoir of
infected birds in the region.
American and Fish Crows are omnivorous scavengers. The American Crow in
particular is well-adapted to human environments (especially so relative to
the other species mentioned) and is large enough to be noticed. This may
partially account for the large number of crows associated with WNV.
It would be interesting to know if any hunters or birdwatchers have noticed
anything unusual.

casual observation, armchair investigations, and narrow skills to fully
appreciate and understand the implications of the occurrence and spread of
WNV in the Western Hemisphere. - Mod.CHC
