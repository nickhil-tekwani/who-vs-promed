A Hong Kong man infected with the deadly H7N9 bird flu [avian influenza] died late on Monday [13 Jan 2014], less than a week after he was confirmed to be infected with the deadly virus, authorities said.

The 65 year old man was the 2nd person to die from the virus in Hong Kong, and the 3rd reported case of H7N9 infection. "The patient passed away at 7:02 pm tonight," a government statement released late Monday [13 Jan 2014] said.

Initial investigations showed that the man had travelled to the neighbouring mainland Chinese city of Shenzhen a week before he was infected.

He had not been directly exposed to live poultry, but had probably contracted the virus outside the city, Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection controller, Leung Ting-hung, had told reporters last week [week of 8 Jan 2014].

"Our initial investigation has revealed that the patient traveled to Lowu, Shenzhen with a family member from 1 Jan to 2 Jan 2014. He passed by a wet market which sold live poultry in Lowu on 1 Jan 2014," Leung had said. 5 close contacts of the man remain under quarantine, with 98 other contacts, including health care workers and others, under medical surveillance.

An 80 year old man died on Boxing Day last year [26 Dec 2013] after he was infected with H7N9, Hong Kong's 1st death from the virus. The case was the 2nd reported incidence of H7N9 infection in the city after a 36 year old Indonesian domestic helper was diagnosed in early December [2013].

Hong Kong is particularly alert to the spread of viruses after an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) swept through the city in 2003, killing 299 people and infecting around 1800.

The H7N9 outbreak began in China in February 2013 and reignited fears that a virus could mutate to become easily transmissible, potentially triggering a pandemic.

As of 12 Jan [2014], a total of 169 human cases of avian influenza H7N9 have been confirmed on the mainland.

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/01/china-confirms-11-more-h7n9-cases-1-fatal


Lab tests in China have confirmed 11 more H7N9 influenza infections over the past 3 days, including a fatal case, and Hong Kong has confirmed an H7N9 death in a previously reported case.

Those dead from the virus are a woman from Zhejiang province and a man from Hong Kong who got sick after visiting the mainland.

New H7N9 case reports are steadily piling up in eastern China, where a 2nd wave of infections is well under way amid a ramp-up of street market activity ahead of the Lunar New Year later this month [31 Jan 2014]. The new cases are from 3 recent H7N9 hot spots in eastern China: Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and the city of Shanghai.

Of the newest cases, 6 are men and 5 are women. Patients' ages range from 28 to 78. Among the survivors, 5 are in critical condition, 2 are listed as severe, and 3 are stable.

Case details
------------
In separate statements over the past 3 days, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) provided details about all the newly reported cases, based on notifications it received from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission.

The 4 case-patients from Guangdong province include a 29 year old man from Guangzhou who is hospitalized in critical condition, a 76 year old man from Shenzhen who is in stable condition, and 2 patients from Foshan for whom few details were available.

However, a statement today [13 Jan 2014] in Chinese from the provincial health ministry, translated by and posted on the Avian Flu Diary infectious disease news blog, indicates that the Foshan patients are a 28 year old woman who works as a poultry seller, hospitalized in stable condition, and a 46 year old man who works as a driver and lives in district where poultry are raised. He is hospitalized in a critical condition.

Both patients had ties to Foshan's Nanhai district, where health officials ordered a 2-day closure of live-bird markets, according to the translated health ministry report.

The 5 patients from Zhejiang province include a 75 year old woman who had been exposed to poultry and died from her H7N9 illness on 9 Jan [2014], a 78 year old man who is in a critical condition, and a 34 year old man who is in a stable condition.

A CHP statement today [13 Jan 2014] said there were 2 more cases from Zhejiang province, but it didn't have any details. However, a statement today [13 Jan 2014] from the provincial health ministry, translated and posted by Avian Flu Diary, said the patients are women, ages 41 and 59, from the city of Ningbo. Both are hospitalized with severe infections.

The 2 patients from Shanghai are a 58 year old woman and a 56 year old man. Both are hospitalized in critical condition and had been exposed to poultry, according to the CHP.

The 2nd newly reported death is that of a 65 year old man from Hong Kong whose illness was first reported by the CHP on 8 Jan [2014]. He became ill after traveling to the mainland city of Shenzhen, where he walked past one of the city's live-bird markets but did not go in.

The CHP said the man died this evening [13 Jan 2014] and that it is monitoring 5 of his close contacts and 98 other contacts. The CHP said 8 contacts have reported nonspecific symptoms, and respiratory specimens for 7 have tested negative for the H7 virus. Test results are pending for the remaining sample.

The 11 new cases raise the number of confirmed H7N9 cases in China and its close neighbors to 174. The 2 new fatalities push the number of deaths in the outbreak so far to 52.

In related developments, the World Health Organization (WHO) said China has notified it of 6 more lab-confirmed H7N9 infections, one of them fatal, all of which were initially reported late last week [week of 6 Jan 2014]. Of the 6 patients, 3 had exposure to poultry, one of the 3 works in the wholesale poultry industry, 2 of the patients are in critical condition, one is in serious condition, and 2 have mild illnesses.

They include a 54 year old man from Jiangsu province, a 79 year old woman and a 30 year old man from Zhejiang province, a 59 year old woman and a 42 year old woman from Guangdong province, and a 38 year old man from Fujian province who died from his illness. The man who died had underlying illnesses, including tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis, according to WHO.

So far there is no sign of sustained human-to-human transmission, WHO said. Most of the cases are sporadic, and health officials strongly suspect that many of the cases involve exposure to infected poultry and their environments in market settings.

Elsewhere, local health officials in south western China's Guizhou province identified a suspected H7N9 case on 11 Jan [2014], in a 38 year old who had been working in Zhejiang province before he returned home on 4 Jan 2014 after having cough and dizziness a month ago, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported today [13 Jan 2014].

The man was hospitalized on 8 Jan [2014] after his symptoms worsened, and he died the next day. If his case is confirmed, his illness will be the 1st to be reported from Guizhou province.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) received notification today (14 Jan 2104) from the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of 3 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Fujian (one case) and Zhejiang (2 cases).

The case in Fujian involves a 50 year old man who lives in Quanzhou. He is currently under treatment in a local hospital and his condition is critical.

The cases in Zhejiang involve a 29 year old man and a 58 year old man, both of whom live in Hangzhou. They are still hospitalised for treatment.

As of 9 pm today [14 Jan 2014], a total of 172 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been confirmed in the Mainland, including Zhejiang (62 cases), Shanghai (36 cases), Jiangsu (30 cases), Guangdong (16 cases), Fujian (7 cases), Jiangxi (6 cases), Anhui (4 cases), Henan (4 cases), Beijing (2 cases), Hunan (2 cases), Shandong (2 cases), and Hebei (one case).

The CHP will follow up with the Mainland health authorities for more case details.

"Locally, enhanced disease surveillance, port health measures, and health education against avian influenza are ongoing. We will remain vigilant and maintain liaison with the World Health Organization (WHO) and relevant health authorities. Local surveillance activities will be modified upon the WHO's recommendations," a spokesman for the DH said.

"All boundary control points have implemented disease prevention and control measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Random temperature checks by handheld devices will also be arranged. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up investigation," the spokesman added.

Regarding health education for travellers, distribution of pamphlets, display of posters in departure and arrival halls, in-flight public announcements, environmental health inspections, and provision of regular updates to the travel industry via meetings and correspondence are all proceeding.

"Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas and provinces, with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds, or their droppings in affected areas and provinces," the spokesman advised.
