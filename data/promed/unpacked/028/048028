Fears for new malaria drug resistance
-------------------------------------
In a small community in Western Cambodia, scientists are puzzling
over why malaria parasites seem to be developing a resistance to
drugs -- and fearing the consequences.

Ten days ago [18 May 2009], a teacher in Battambang Province, became
ill with chills, fever, headache, and vomiting. He was treated at a
nearby health centre with drugs considered a "silver bullet" in the
battle against falciparum malaria.

This treatment with artesunate drugs was part of a clinical study
being carried out by the US Armed Forces Research Institute of
Medical Science (AFRIMS).

In the past, artesunates have always cleared malaria parasites from
the blood in 2 or 3 days. But after 4 days of monitored treatment,
[that teacher] was still testing positive for parasites.

Dr Delia Bethell, an investigator working on the clinical trials,
said he wasn't alone. Out of about 90 patients included in the study
so far, roughly a third to half were still positive for malaria
parasites after 3 days, some even after 4 or 5 days.

"It appears that the artesunate is working more slowly than
previously," she said. "It appears that the parasite probably is
developing some kind of tolerance or is somehow less sensitive to the
effects of the drug. But nobody knows why that might be."

These early results need to be more thoroughly investigated, she
said. The concern is that this could be the start of emerging
resistance to the artemisinin family of drugs. If full-blown
resistance did develop, it would be extremely dire.

"This is by far the most effective drug we have," explained Dr
Bethell. "And there are no new drugs coming through the system in the
next few years."

Scientists are particularly concerned because the last 2 generations
of anti-malarial drugs were undermined by resistance. And in those
earlier cases, resistance also started in Western Cambodia, and in a
similar way.

No-one is sure why this area seems to have become a nursery for
anti-malaria drug resistance. One factor could be the inappropriate
use of drugs, related to a lack of medical supervision. The public
health system is weak. Government clinics often run out of drugs or
may be closed when patients want access to them. Instead, many
patients visit private pharmacies to buy anti-malarial drugs there.

Coloured tablets
----------------
I visited one small drugs stall in Pailin's general market,
sandwiched between a clothes outlet and a general grocery store. All
pharmacies are supposed to be licensed. But the stallholder told me
he didn't have a licence. He'd applied for one, he said, but the
paperwork had never been processed. Many others running pharmacies,
he said, were in the same position.

I watched him and his wife make up their own packets of drugs on the
glass-topped counter, shaking a variety of coloured tablets into
unlabelled plastic bags.

In many such private pharmacies, the customers choose what they want,
deciding partly by price. The quality of the advice they get varies
enormously. If, as a result, they end up taking the wrong drugs in
the wrong combinations, this too can fuel drug resistance.

The availability of many counterfeit drugs on the market only
compounds the problem.

Professor Nick Day, director of the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine
Research Unit, is also running clinical trials in the region. He and
his team have also found that artesunate-type drugs are starting to
become less effective. This resistance must be contained urgently,
because its spread would be a global health disaster, he said.

Resistance to previous malaria drugs caused major loss of life in
Africa, he said. "If the same thing happens again, the spread of a
resistant parasite from Asia to Africa, then that will have
devastating consequences for malaria control."

In a clearing in the jungle, about 1.5 hours drive from Pailin along
rough dirt roads, I watched health workers distribute mosquito nets
to about 200 villagers. It's one of a series of measures being rushed
through to stop the spread of resistant parasites.

If they're not contained, history may repeat itself -- and the fear
is that many millions of people worldwide will lose their protection
against this deadly disease.

[Artesunate is in the class of medications known as artemisinins,
which are derivatives from the qinghaosu or sweet wormwood plant.
Artesunate is effective for the treatment of severe malaria, including
cerebral malaria. It is also active against chloroquine- and
mefloquine-resistant strains of _Plasmodium falciparum_.

The resistance of artesunate resistant malaria could be developed by
the use of counterfeit antimalarials, suboptimal treatment of cases
by monotherapy with artemisinin alone, or widespread use of
antimalarials for febrile illnesses without prescriptions or proper
clinical evidence.

During January 2009, resistance to artemisinin combination therapy
(ACT) was increasingly reported along the Thai-Cambodian border as
well (see ProMED ref. below). Battambang province borders with
Thailand.
