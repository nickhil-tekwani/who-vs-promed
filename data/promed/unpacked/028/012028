Is anyone compiling the clinical data that we need if we are to best use
Tamiflu (oseltamivir) in an avian influenza epidemic? Seems that the public
health recommendations for using Tamiflu are based on theoretical
considerations. What have we learned from actual cases?
Has anyone yet compiled the South East Asian avian influenza cases as case
studies? That is, put together any or most of the variables concerning the
Southeast Asian avian influenza cases who were treated with Tamiflu, such
as onset of illness, reason for starting treatment, at what stage of
illness the treatment started, dose/day (mg/kg), length of treatment, outcome?
Do we have a case study of the Vietnamese girl with the 3 different
Tamiflu-resistant H5N1 isolates? What about the 12 deaths of the Japanese
children reported currently in the press? [see below]

Federal health advisers are looking into the deaths of 12 Japanese children
who took Tamiflu, part of their annual safety review of the anti-flu
medication and 7 other drugs. There [have been] no reports of deaths in the
United States or Europe associated with Tamiflu.
"Based on the information we have right now, we cannot say definitively
there is a causal relation between the drug and the children's deaths," Dr.
Murray Lumpkin, the deputy commissioner of the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), said on Thu 17 Nov 2005. The Japanese deaths were
detailed in papers released in advance of a Food and Drug Administration
advisory committee meeting Friday. An update by FDA staff also includes
reports of 32 "neuropsychiatric events" associated with Tamiflu, all but
one experienced by Japanese patients.
Those cases included delirium, hallucinations, convulsions and
encephalitis. "Clearly, any time you get a report of a death or a serious
occurrence, you want to look into it," Lumpkin said. The FDA sought and
received more information from the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche
Holding AG, which makes Tamiflu, and from Japanese health authorities. It
has not issued any warnings or initiated any other action, spokeswoman
Susan Bro said. Lumpkin said "millions and millions" of patients have
safely used the drug to treat [influenza].
Complicating the issue is that many of the Japanese reports of death and
adverse reactions list symptoms commonly associated with [influenza], he
said. "It is very difficult, when the underlying disease causes [the
symptoms] being reported, to figure out: Is it the underlying disease? Is
it the drug?" said Lumpkin. Roche said that several studies in the United
States and Canada had shown that the death incidence rate of influenza
patients who took Tamiflu was far below those who did not. "The mortality
was actually lower versus those who did not receive the drug," said Joseph
Hoffman, who heads pharmaceutical development for virology and
transplantation at Roche.
Roche has supplied the FDA with 2 additional studies it commissioned that
evaluated the safety of Tamiflu in pediatric patients.
Japan's Health Ministry warned last week that Tamiflu may induce "strange
behavior" after reporting that 2 teenage boys died shortly after taking the
medicine. "Roche has carefully reviewed these events and has concluded that
a causal link cannot be established," the company said in a statement
released on Monday. However, the Japanese distributor of the Roche-patented
drug told health officials it could not rule out a link between Tamiflu and
the deaths. Roche said the high number of deaths and adverse
neuropsychiatric events in Japan was also due to the fact that 2 of 3
people taking Tamiflu are in Japan. Of 32 million people treated with
Tamiflu since its approval in 1999, 24 million were in Japan.
The US labeling for Tamiflu lists nausea and vomiting as its most serious
side effects. Its labeling in Japan includes any adverse effects that have
been reported -- including impaired consciousness, abnormal behavior and
hallucinations -- regardless of whether they can be attributed to the drug,
according to Roche.
Tamiflu is one of the few drugs believed effective in treating bird flu,
which health officials fear could spark a pandemic should it mutate into a
form easily passed from human to human.
