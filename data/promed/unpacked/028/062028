Brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_), Panama
------------------------------------------------------
Information received on 13 Oct 2013 from Dr Manuel Antonio Gonzalez Cano, Delegate, Direccion de Salud Animal, Ministerio de Desarrollo Agropecuario, Panama city, Panama

Summary:
Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 13 Aug 2013
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 28 Aug 2013
Report date: 13 Oct 2013
Date submitted to OIE: 13 Oct 2013
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: March 2012
Manifestation of disease: Sub-clinical disease
Causal agent: _Brucella abortus_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Monte Oscuro, Cermeno, Capira, Panama
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Aug 2013
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 78 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 4

Affected population: It is a dairy farm where reactors were detected through field tests and complementary tests. Therefore, according to national regulations, modified stamping out, in this case of the reactors, is applied. No signs compatible with the disease were observed in the farm during the investigation, but, following the results obtained, an investigation has been launched in the farms in the zone in order to get more data and a possible source of infection.

Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 78 / 4 / 0 / 0 / 4
Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 5.13 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 5.13 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: A field investigation has been launched in all the surrounding farms in order to detect additional outbreaks and the source of infection. It is appropriate to note that for this report, it has been taken into account that the disease has occurred in a zone where sampling was being done in order to declare the zone free from bovine brucellosis; no reactors had been detected previously in this zone. More details will be sent as the field investigation continues.

Control measures
Measures applied:
Quarantine
Movement control inside the country
Modified stamping out
Vaccination prohibited

Measures to be applied:
Screening

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Veterinary Research and Diagnosis Laboratory "Dr. Gerardino Medina" (National laboratory) / Cattle / bacteriological examination / 30 Aug 2013 / Positive
Veterinary Research and Diagnosis Laboratory "Dr. Gerardino Medina" (National laboratory) / Cattle / antibody detection ELISA / 28 Aug 2013 / Positive
Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Brucellosis is a contagious disease of livestock with significant economic impact. The disease is caused by various bacteria of the family Brucella, which [each] tend to infect a specific animal species. However, most species of Brucella are able to infect other animal species as well. The disease affects cattle, swine, sheep and goats, camels, equines, and dogs. It may also infect other ruminants, some marine mammals, and humans.

The disease in animals is characterized by abortions or reproductive failure. While animals typically recover and will be able to have live offspring following the initial abortion, they may continue to shed the bacteria.

Brucellosis in cattle (_B. abortus_) in sheep and goats (_B. melitensis_) and in swine (_B. suis_) are diseases listed in the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Terrestrial Animal Health Code and must be reported to the OIE (Terrestrial Animal Health Code).

Brucellosis is a zoonosis highly infectious for humans causing a disease often called undulant fever or Malta fever, since it was 1st recognized in Malta during the 1850s http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Media_Center/docs/pdf/Disease_cards/BCLS-EN.pdf.

Quantitative information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database shows that during 2012, 9586 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_) were reported in the region of the Americas: Bolivia (44), Brazil (1188), Canada (1), Chile (32), Colombia (9), Costa Rica (201), Cuba (33), Dominican Republic (101), Ecuador (62), El Salvador (31), Guatemala (173), Honduras (49), Mexico (6994), Nicaragua (22), Panama (1), Paraguay (508), Peru (4) and Uruguay (131). This information is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail.

In the United States of America, 2 outbreaks were reported during 2012. The disease was limited to free-ranging bison (_Bison bison_) and wapiti (_Cervus elaphus_) in the Greater Yellowstone National Park area. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist/note/id/249/disn/Brucellosis%2B%2528Brucella%2Babortus%2529.

The disease is also present in Argentina and Venezuela, but no quantitative data are available http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist.

Panama is the southernmost country of Central America. The country is situated on the isthmus connecting North and South America and is bordered by Costa Rica to the west, Colombia to the southeast, the Caribbean Sea to the north, and the Pacific Ocean to the south. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama. The country is divided into 9 provinces: Bocas del Toro, Chiriqui, Cocle, Colon, Darien, Herrera, Los Santos, Panama and Veraguas. Capira is a district of the province of Panama http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capira_District.

From January 2006 to December 2012, Panama reported 59 outbreaks of brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_). These 59 outbreaks were located in 7 of the 9 provinces. The incidence of brucellosis during this 7-year period and the distribution by province is summarized as follows:
Provinces /2006 / 2007 / 2008 / 2009 / 2010 / 2011 / 2012
Bocas del Toro / / / 4 / 3 / 4 / / /
Chiriqui / 2 / 6 / 2 / 3 / 2 / / /
Cocle / 1 / 1 / / / / / /
