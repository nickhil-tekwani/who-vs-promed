Salem (CT) School shut down after students get rashes again
------
Health experts offered different explanations Monday night about the source
of a problem that caused school officials to close the Salem School for the
second time in 4 days.
Educators closed the school Mon 25 Nov 2002 after 17 students were sent to
area emergency rooms to be treated for rashes that officials believe may be
linked to the school. Officials said most of the children's symptoms cleared
up by the time they got to the hospitals, WTIC-TV reported.
At a town meeting Monday night, an industrial hygienist said he found black
mold at the school, while the town health director said he believed the
problem was outside the building because neighbors have reported similar
rashes.
The school was to remain shut Tuesday and Wednesday as state environmental
officials try to determine the cause of the problem. The middle school wing
of the school was closed Friday after 24 students developed rashes and some
asthmatic children reported having difficulty breathing.
Professional cleaners worked at the school over the weekend, and janitors
scoured walls and air ducts early Monday morning. But students soon
complained again about a burning sensation and developed redness on their
arms and the back of their necks. Nearly 80 students showed symptoms, school
officials said.
Officials of the state Department of Environmental Protection were to work
with an industrial hygienist Monday night to pinpoint the problem. The
hygienist said he found black mold, a problem that has caused health
problems across the country in homes and schools.
But the health director for the town, said he believed the problem lay
outside because neighbors have shown symptoms similar to those of the
students.

[This episode appears similar to a series of like events across the U.S.
previously reported by ProMED-mail. During October 2001-May 2002, rashes
among groups of students were reported in approximately 110 U.S. schools.
Rashes, as in this cluster, appeared to be evanescent and only occasionally
accompanied by other symptoms. A fairly extensive CDC investigation showed
the causes to be many, including contact dermatitis, allergies/ eczema,
scratching induced by witnessing others with rashes, and infections (e.g.,
Parvovirus B19). The economic and social burden associated with these
clusters is often high, and vigilance may be heightened by fears of
bioterrorist activity. In the absence of associated signs and symptoms, the
outcomes are nearly always good. We would appreciate additional information
regarding this cluster when it becomes available. - Mod.LM]
