This is recycled information dating back to 21-22 Jan 2008, which
combines information from AFP articles from these dates (see:
<http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5h8lZtdKR_UTQlUou9bnyMl_STvKQ>).

Note the quotation from market vendor Sheikh Ali found in the earlier
article, also: "Poor villagers are feasting on chicken. At normal
times, they cannot afford to buy as prices are so high. Now they are
enjoying the meat," Ali said. This quote brings to mind the Biblical
proverb immortalized in the play/movie "Fiddler on the roof," "When a
poor man eats a chicken, one of them must be sick."
