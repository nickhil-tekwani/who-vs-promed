A child in Bihar's Muzaffarpur has been detected with symptoms of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Shrikrishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCK), and paediatrics department has confirmed the case on Friday [19 Feb 2021].

"Paediatrics department yesterday [Thu 18 Feb 2021] confirmed one case of AES in Muzaffarpur's SKMC Hospital," hospital superintendent Dr BS Jha said. "We are prepared to deal with this case; we have arranged the medicines. There will be a review meeting on 24 Feb [2021] with concerned officials regarding the case."

In October 2020, a total of 77 children were admitted to SKMCH hospital with AES/Japanese encephalitis.

AES is a viral disease that causes flu-like symptoms such as high fever, vomiting, and, in extreme cases, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney.

[Although there are fewer cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) and Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Bihar state this year [2021] than in previous years, these cases continue to occur in that state. From 27 Mar 2020 until 1 Nov 2020, 89 children suffering from AES/JE were admitted to Muzaffarpur's Shrikrishna Medical College & Hospital in Bihar.

The above and previous reports do not indicate how many of the AES cases are due to Japanese encephalitis. As mentioned in many previous ProMED posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and intoxication from lychee fruit consumption. Dr. T. Jacob John noted that hypoglycemic encephalopathy is triggered by litchi consumption, and Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, East Champaran, and Sitamarhi are litchi-growing districts in Bihar. These 4 are non-Japanese encephalitis districts (see Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) 20200831.7730992 and Japanese encephalitis & other - India (12): (BR) corr, comment 20200902.7740196). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 most common agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of cases will not be possible. The season in which AES and JE cases occur is underway, and additional cases can be expected over the coming 2-3 months. - Mod.TY
