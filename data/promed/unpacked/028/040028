The Libya Health Ministry says that the country has seen some 5000 cases of the parasitic disease leishmaniasis in the past 6 months, according to a media account.

"There are currently 5000 patients who are being treated," said Ahmad al-Qarari, who heads the centre for disease control at the health ministry of Libya's UN-backed unity government.

[We assume that these are cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). CL is caused by the protozoan _Leishmania_ parasite, which is transmitted by sandflies. Outbreaks occur when vector and reservoir control activities break down.

Zoonotic CL is endemic in Libya, with sporadic outbreaks (1).

"In 2006, over 7000 cases were recorded in 8 districts, with an outbreak of 3961 cases in Misratah, and the disease spread to nonendemic areas" (2).

"In 2009, the prevalence of CL was 7.1 per 10 000 population" (2).

"There is a vector control program that involves insecticide spraying, and regular rodent control is performed" (2).
