Death toll of dengue fever reaches 389 in Indonesia
----------------------------------------------
The death toll from dengue fever across Indonesia since January this
year [2004] has reached 389 and the sufferers increased to 226 013,
said Mariani Reksoprojo, a spokeswoman of the Health Ministry, on
Friday. She said that Jakarta is still the area with the most
infections.
3 ministries -- ministries of health, the people's welfare and
poverty alleviation, as well home affairs -- coordinated with all
provincial governments to step up efforts to stop the spread of the
outbreak. "The minister of health has asked hospitals to immediately
help new patients," Reksoprojo added.
Syafei Achmad, secretary general of the prevention of the infectious
disease under the Health Ministry, said that some 89 percent of the
sufferers are in good condition. The official said that the toll of
death and suffering in some provinces, such as Eastern Nusa Tenggara,
Jambi, and Yogyakarta, has declined.
The recent attack was different from the normal 5-year cycle [because
of] the change of rainy season from October, November, and December
to January and February, he said.

Singapore steps up dengue fever checks
-------------------------------------------
Singapore plans to step up dengue fever checks because of an outbreak
in neighbouring Indonesia that has killed over 340 people [389 - see
above] and sickened around 20 000 [this must be the number
hospitalized out of the more than 200 000 reported above. - Mod.JW].
Singapore's own cases of the disease have declined, with the
city-state reporting 560 cases in the first 2 months of 2004, down
from 688 in the same period of 2003, the National Environment Agency
said.
"The overall situation is under control and showing signs of
improvement," it said in a statement late Wednesday. But the agency,
responsible for monitoring public health in the city-state, said it
would step up enforcement and surveillance to prevent the
mosquito-borne illness from spreading.
Singapore issues fines for people who leave watering cans, buckets,
and other containers with stagnant water in the open. During February
2004, the High Court fined a man 6000 Singapore dollars (US$3530) for
leaving a water-filled plastic pail lid outside his residence.

Northern Fiji on dengue fever "red alert"
-------------------------------------
Health authorities in Fiji have declared an alert following 2
confirmed cases of dengue fever in the Northern Division. Commercial
radio station Legend says a Health Ministry spokesperson has
confirmed that 2 patients suffering from dengue were admitted to
Labasa hospital. The patients have stabilized through a successful
management programme.
The spokesman says the red alert has been issued for the Northern
Division and other parts of the country because of the dengue
outbreak in Indonesia, which [carries a high fatality rate] and seems
to have spread to Fiji. He says there is a high risk of dengue
because of a high mosquito population during the current rainy season.
Previous outbreaks of dengue in Fiji have resulted in tens of
thousands becoming sick and scores of deaths.

More dengue cases in Cairns, Torres Strait mosquito blitz
--------------------------------------------------
More cases of dengue fever have been reported in Cairns, bringing the
year's total to 10, Queensland's Tropical Public Health Unit said
today.
Medical entomologist Dr Scott Ritchie urged residents to regularly
check their yards for mosquito breeding sites and use insect sprays,
repellants, mozzie zappers, and coils. "Now that we are having a real
wet season again, mosquito numbers have gone through the roof," Dr
Ritchie said. "If everyone takes these few steps, we can soon stop
this outbreak."
Last year [2003] there were 7 outbreaks of dengue fever in north
Queensland affecting more than 600 people, 459 of them in Cairns. In
Townsville, there have been 18 confirmed dengue fever cases since
November [2003].
On Thursday Island in the Torres Strait, 19 Queensland Health staff
this week joined local council officers to carry out an intensive
dengue mosquito control program. Since the dengue outbreak began in
the Torres Strait last November [2003], 254 cases of the disease have
been reported.
Dr Ritchie said outbreaks on Yam and Murray Islands had been stopped
by mosquito control and public education measures, but it was proving
more difficult to stop on Thursday Island. He said this was due to
the larger population, a large amount of discarded items collecting
rainwater, and other hidden breeding sites such as underground wells
and receptacles in the cemetery. Early last month, a 40-year-old
woman from Thursday Island died of dengue shock syndrome en route to
Cairns Base Hospital. She is believed to be the first Queenslander
to die of the [infection with the] virus in almost 100 years.

Clean-up drive urged in Philippines to avoid dengue epidemic.
----------------------------------------------------
The Philippine government urged the public Sunday to observe
cleanliness to prevent a dengue fever epidemic after 399 cases,
including 3 deaths, were reported nationwide in the first 2 months of
this year.
"Despite the 33 percent decrease in the number of cases compared to
the same period of 2003, we are alerting the public this early
because 2004 might be an epidemic year due to the cycle of the
disease," Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit was quoted by the Philippine
News Agency as saying. Dayrit issued the appeal after receiving a
preliminary report from the National Epidemiology Center, it said.
Although there were no reported hotspots or outbreaks, clustering of
cases was noted in some areas of the capital region. "We can prevent
dengue transmission by destroying mosquito breeding sites," Dayrit
said. He urged the public to practice preventive measures such as
cleaning roof gutters, puncturing old tires, regularly replacing
water at flower vases, and using mosquito nets.
