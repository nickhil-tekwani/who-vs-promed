Health department officials are urging Escambia County residents and visitors to protect themselves from rabies exposure by avoiding contact with wild and stray animals after a rabid cat attacked 2 people.

A stray cat recently attacked 2 individuals in Escambia County, and tissue samples from the animal tested at the state laboratory confirmed the presence of the rabies virus, according to a news release from the Florida Department of Health (FDOH) in Escambia County.

Rabies is a viral disease that infects the central nervous system. Without proper treatment, rabies can cause brain infection and death. It is transmitted by a rabid animal through a bite, a scratch, or by contact with mucous membranes such as the eyes, nose or mouth.

Dr. John J. Lanza, director of the FDOH-Escambia, stressed that while rabies is a fatal infection, it is preventable. Rabies shots can protect a bite victim from developing the rabies infection if given soon after the bite occurs.

"It is important to not feed or pet wild and stray animals, to avoid animals appearing to be acting strangely, and to keep pets vaccinated against rabies," he said in a prepared statement. "Persons who are bitten by a wild animal or an animal who has not been vaccinated against rabies should seek immediate medical care. Proper medical treatment of an animal bite can be life-saving" [Medical attention may still be necessary for the bitten person, even if the animal is appropriately vaccinated. - Mod.TG].

In Florida, raccoons, foxes, bats and cats are the animals most frequently diagnosed with rabies. Other animals at high risk for rabies include dogs, bobcats, skunks and otters. Because of their proximity to people, stray and unvaccinated cats and dogs pose a special risk.

To protect yourself and your loved ones against rabies, follow these steps:

- Teach your children not to go near wild and stray animals, and never keep them as pets.
- Vaccinate your dog, cat, ferret or horse to protect against rabies. Keep vaccinations up-to-date.
- Do not feed your pets outside. The food may attract wild animals.
- Make sure your garbage is securely covered. Open garbage attracts wild and stray animals.
- Spay or neuter your pet to reduce its tendency to roam or fight. Do not let your pets roam freely or allow them to interact with wild or stray animals. Keep them in a fenced yard or on a leash.
- Call County Animal Control to remove stray animals from your neighborhood.
- Prevent bats from entering living quarters or occupied spaces in homes, churches, schools and other similar areas, where they might come into contact with people and pets.

If your pet is bitten by another animal, immediately seek veterinary assistance for your animal, and contact Escambia County Animal Control. If you are bitten by a wild animal, or by any animal acting strangely, seek medical care as soon as possible so that a physician can evaluate your risk of rabies infection and administer the rabies vaccine if appropriate.

[2] North Carolina - fox, dog, human exposure

When a crazed fox attacked her 2 pet dogs, a North Carolina woman grabbed a 2-by-4 [board] and whacked the rabid animal away, a sheriff's officer said.

The gray fox scampered into nearby bushes, but not before biting the woman in the calf of her leg, Cabarrus County sheriff's Lt. James Torelli told The Charlotte Observer.

When deputies arrived at the woman's home on U.S. 601 South between Concord and Midland, the fox went for them, too, Torelli said. That's when the officers shot and killed the animal.

The woman, who is in her 70s, was hospitalized after Wednesday [22 May 2019] morning's attack but has since been released, the officer said. She will continue to receive a series of rabies shots, after results from a state lab on Thursday confirmed the fox was rabid, according to Torelli.

At 7:30 a.m. Wednesday [22 May 2019], the woman had let her dogs out as usual when the fox emerged and "got into it" with one of them, Torelli said. Two deputies arrived at her home after the woman called 911.

The woman's dogs were up to date on their rabies vaccines but received booster shots, the lieutenant said.

Homeowners have the right to shoot or otherwise kill an animal attacking them or their pets, Torelli said. But he advises people to return to their home and call authorities if they see a wild animal acting aggressively or otherwise oddly. Cabarrus County animal control responders are sworn law enforcement officers, he said.

[Both of these articles give some tips on how to prevent animal bites as well as respond to a bite.

Build a wall between you and the deadly virus rabies by vaccinating your pets; this includes your dogs AND your cats. It is a measure of protection for yourself as well as your pets.

Keeping your pet vaccinated against rabies is extremely important. As noted in the 2nd article, the dogs were appropriately vaccinated. Thus, the dogs receive medical attention for the bites and a booster rabies vaccine. Proper and up-to-date rabies vaccination saved these dogs' lives and prevented the owner from having the heartache of the loss of her pets.

Neither of these articles mentions rabies clinics to get more animals vaccinated and to educate the public about the need for rabies prevention. - Mod.TG
