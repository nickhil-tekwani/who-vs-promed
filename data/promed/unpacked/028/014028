I would like to call to your attention the following recent review on
this subject by John Leedom:
Leedom JM: Milk of nonhuman origin and infectious diseases in humans.
Clin Infect Dis. 2006; 43: 610-15.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Dassey for pointing out this publication. Indeed,
Dr. Leedom's article is excellent background material regarding the
infectious diseases associated with unpasteurized milk. Below are
several extracted paragraphs that provide an overview of the field
and regarding _E. coli_ O157:H7 in particular. The citation numbers
have been changed to start with 1.
"Industrialization of the United States dairy industry began in the
1800s. The pooling of milk and mass distribution resulted in
outbreaks of disease. Milk pooled from large numbers of cows
permitted pathogen-containing milk that originated in one cow to
contaminate thousands of gallons. Therefore, Certified Milk
Commissions were established to improve milk sanitation in all phases
of milk production, packaging, and distribution [1, 2]. The
commissions set standards, oversaw milk production, and certified the
products of compliant dairies as Grade A certified. With the advent
of high-volume pasteurization technology, most public health
officials, physicians, and veterinarians concluded that
pasteurization would ensure a safe milk supply [1]. Many members of
the commissions believed that pasteurization engendered sterilized
filth and destroyed essential nutrients in the milk [1]. Eventually,
the model for the production of safe milk included the commissions'
sanitary standards, as well as pasteurization [2].
In 1995, a total of 28 states permitted the intrastate sale of raw
milk to consumers [3]. Jurisdictions with legal raw milk sales
experienced a disproportionate share of the milkborne outbreaks of
illness reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
from 1973 through 1992, with 40 (87 percent) of 46 raw
milk-associated outbreaks of disease occurring in states with legal
raw milk sales [3]. Raw milk accounted for less than 1 percent of
total milk sold in states permitting such sales [3]. Interstate
transportation of raw milk that was not destined for pasteurization
was prohibited in 1987 [3].
_E. coli_ O157:H7, an important cause of gastroenteritis that is
sometimes complicated by the hemolytic uremic syndrome, is carried by
cattle and can contaminate raw milk. In one study [4], _E. coli_
O157:H7 was isolated from 153 (4.3 percent) of 3593 bovine rectal swab samples.
A recent illustrative example of raw milk being associated with an
outbreak of illness due to _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection was reported
in Oregon [5]. The organism that was causing disease was associated
with raw milk from a specific dairy that was being sold in grocery
stores. _E. coli_ isolates from the 6 initial human cases were
homologous with those from the dairy herd. The health authorities
instituted warnings and labeling requirements and increased
monitoring of the dairy. Nevertheless, retail sales -- and associated
cases of illness -- continued to occur for more than a year [5].
Low-level outbreaks associated with raw milk can continue
indefinitely if distribution and sales continue.
Washington allows the direct sale of unpasteurized milk by only 6
farms, which are licensed for production and bottling [6]. In
December 2005, _E. coli_ O157 infected 16 people after they drank
unpasteurized milk from an unlicensed farm. Milk samples were tested
for the pathogen, with positive results [6]."
