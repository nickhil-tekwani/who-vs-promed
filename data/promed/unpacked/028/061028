HEARTWATER, IMPORTED - USA (FLORIDA): ALERT
***********************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: "Steve Grenard" <grenard@mail.con2.com>

As of Dec 1999 there is an emergency State rule banning the
Importation into the State of Florida of any African spurred
tortoises (_Geochelone sulcata_) or leopard tortoises (_Geochelone
pardalis_).

The emergency ban is due to the recent finding that some of these
reptiles are infected with "tropical bont ticks" (_Amblyomma_ spp.)
carrying the rickettsial agent (_Cowdria ruminantium_) and may
transmit heartwater disease (HW).

Heartwater is an acute tick-borne disease of domestic and wild
ruminants, including cattle, sheep, goats, deer and antelope. This killer
disease is caused by the rickettsia _Cowdria ruminantium_ which is
transmitted by ticks of the genus _Amblyomma_ spp. It is characterized
by a rapid rise in body temperature, loss of appetite and respiratory
distress, followed by nervous signs such as exaggerated blinking of
eyes, circling motions, incoordination, high-stepping stiff gait,
recumbency, and paddling movements of the limbs. Occasionally there
is diarrhea. It terminates in convulsions and prostrations.

Should this disease enter the United States, mortality rates in susceptible
species would be expected to be from 40% to approaching 100%. Since
there is no officially recognized treatment or practical vaccine to protect
against the disease, prevention relies on control of its tick vectors.
[The US Animal Health Association Foreign Animal Diseases
manual says that recently born livestock can be immunized by
injection of HW-infected blood with a simultaneous dose of
doxycycline - Mod.JW]
The same ticks are also potential vectors of diseases which may affect
the general public. [However, heartwater does not affect humans -
Mod.JW]

Reptiles, amphibians, llamas, antelopes, and captive wild species from
all areas are included in this rule because they are potential carriers of
the heartwater [microbe] or of ticks which are competent vectors of
heartwater. Introduction of the disease into Florida would be disastrous
to the State's beef and dairy cattle industries and the State's ruminant
wildlife [and to the rest of North America - Mod.JW].
On 29 Nov 1999, ticks collected from imported tortoises in a
Hillsborough County, Florida reptile facility tested positive for the
disease. The facility is under quarantine, eradication procedures are
under way and it is hoped no wildlife or domestic animals have been
infected. Effective 17 Dec 1999, Florida passed an emergency rule
prohibiting the importation or transportation into the State of any
African spurred tortoise or leopard tortoise.
A memorandum has been sent from law enforcement officials to reptile
dealers, importers, pet shop s and other interested persons detailing the
rule and asking for cooperation to contain the vectors of this disease.
Anyone having the tortoises in question must have the necessary
paperwork showing when the animals were received and the country of
origin.

Outstanding orders for shipments of these species are immediately
canceled and Wildlife Inspectors will monitor the imports coming into
the state and will seize any shipments of these species. They will be
returned to the shipping point at the vendor's expense. It is prohibited to
accept domestic shipments of such tortoises into Florida, also.

Anyone with questions or seeking documentation about the tortoise
prohibition by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation commission
may call (850)488-6253 and questions about the need for Veterinary
Certificates may be directed to the Division of Animal Industry, Bureau
of Disease Control at (850)488-7182.

[_Amblyomma_ ticks are large, three-host parasites. They are more or
less brightly ornamented and generally confined to the tropics and
subtropics. Their long mouth parts make them difficult to remove
manually and they frequently cause serious wounds that may become
secondarily infected by bacteria.
Many African _Amblyomma_ species that infest livestock are vectors of
_Cowdria ruminantium_, the rickettsial agent causing heartwater.

_Amblyomma americanum_, the lone-star tick (a distinctive pale
ornamentation in the male and a conspicuous, silvery spot or star near
the posterior margin in the female) is found in the southern USA from
Texas and Missouri to the Atlantic Coast and ranges northward into
New Jersey. It is a pest in Mexico and Central and South America as
well. [This paragraph has been paraphrased from The Merck Veterinary
Manual].

Currently, heartwater disease is not present in the United States. -
