[A total of 3062 newly confirmed cases have been reported by China in the past 24 hours, compared with 2656 during the similar time frame [7-8 Feb 2020]. This brings the total number of reported confirmed cases to 40 171. In addition, 97 deaths were reported in this time period, bringing the total number of reported deaths to 908. In the past 24 hours there have been 10 newly confirmed cases reported from Hong Kong and 1 newly confirmed case reported from Taiwan.

Unfortunately, the decrease in daily reported cases was not repeated in the past 24 hours. A good epidemic curve by date of onset of illness would be interesting to see, as date of confirmation testing is later than date of onset of illness, not necessarily due to laboratory delays, but related to early mild symptoms not leading to healthcare-seeking behaviors.

[3] False negatives on NAT testing
Date: Sat 8 Feb 2020

Key diagnostic test might be missing many coronavirus cases
------------------------------------------------
China's ability to control a rapidly spreading coronavirus epidemic is under further strain amid fears that a key test used to confirm new cases is failing to catch large numbers of people with the disease. Problems with so-called nucleic acid tests (NATs) widely used to identify the presence of the previously unknown pneumonia-causing virus make it likely that many infections are going uncounted even as the number of confirmed cases continues to spiral.

Authorities are still struggling to ascertain the true extent of the epidemic, which had infected (link in Chinese) 34 598 people and killed 723 in China as of Friday [7 Feb 2020], according to the National Health Commission (NHC). In Hubei, the province at the epicenter of the outbreak, reports of overwhelmed hospitals, scarce medical supplies, and overly stringent diagnostic criteria have complicated efforts to determine the scope of the disease.

Health officials have recommended cheap, abundant, and generally accurate NATs as one of 2 main methods to confirm the presence of the coronavirus in humans. The technique involves collecting samples from patients and testing them for specific kinds of molecules that appear in the genetic material of the new coronavirus. If those molecules are present in the sample, the patient is isolated for treatment. But there is growing concern that those NATs are producing large numbers of false negatives. In a Wednesday [5 Feb 2020] interview with state broadcaster CCTV, Wang Chen, an expert in critical diseases and director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, said one characteristic of the virus was that "not all of those infected by it return positive NATs."

"Even patients who definitely have the disease only come back positive 30%-50% of the time," Wang said. "Testing throat swabs (from potentially infected people) also returns a lot of false negatives."

Tests like NATs are especially important in people that may have contracted the virus but have not yet shown symptoms. Emerging trends in local infections mean that many such patients may have been sent home by hospitals after their NATs came back negative, doctors told Caixin. "At the moment, more and more cases in Wuhan are flaring up collectively in family groups, and the majority are of the concealed onset type," said Zhang Xiaochun, a deputy director of the medical imaging department at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, one of the institutions at the center of the outbreak. "They may have undergone one or even several NATs and shown no clinical symptoms, but keeping them under observation at home is bound to spread the disease further." A doctor in the imaging department of another major Wuhan hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Caixin said that previously some patients whose CT scans clearly showed signs of viral infection but whose NATs tested negative were "released" back into their communities due to a shortage of hospital berths.

NATs are by nature an imperfect mechanism for determining the presence of a given organism. For instance, because the genetic material they test for usually only exists in tiny amounts, many NATs include a step called amplification, which makes many copies of it. A shortcoming of amplification is that it also copies any contaminating DNA in the sample, potentially causing misleading results. "All experienced doctors know that NATs contain flaws," the doctor told Caixin. Aside from NATs, health officials have also recommended the use of gene sequencing to confirm coronavirus infections.

But that method has its own problems. Although gene sequencing is comparatively accurate, it is also expensive, and not all affected hospitals have the necessary facilities. Additionally, at the start of the outbreak, many hospitals had to gain permission from higher authorities to conduct such tests, a rule that has since been relaxed. Experts have previously called for the inclusion of CT scanning as a key basis for diagnosing coronavirus infections, as well as rapid hospital admission and isolation.

In response to calls from medical professionals on the frontlines of the epidemic, the NHC on Tuesday [4 Feb 2020] relaxed the clinical criteria for reporting suspected coronavirus cases, with extra leeway granted to people in Hubei. Outside the stricken province, medical professionals should now suspect coronavirus infection in patients with radiographic evidence of pneumonia, fever, and/or breathing problems, and a low-to-normal white blood cell count or a low lymphocyte count. Within Hubei, only 2 of the 3 criteria are required.

China added more than 3000 new coronavirus cases each day from Monday through Friday [3 Feb through 7 Feb 2020], with the vast majority occurring in Hubei, according to NHC figures.

[4] Selected media reports of transmission outside mainland China
A. Japanese cruise ship

4 Filipinos, among 6 new coronavirus infections on cruise ship in Japan
----------------------------------
Six more people on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama have tested positive for a new coronavirus, the health ministry said Sunday [9 Feb 2020], bringing the total number of those infected on board to 70.

The 5 crew members and 1 passenger -- 4 Filipinos, 1 American, and 1 Ukrainian in their 20s to 70s -- have no serious symptoms, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said. The ministry said it has tested 336 potentially infected people from around 3700 passengers and crew on the vessel, and the latest results on 57 people turned up the 6 new cases.

The ship, carrying customers from more than 50 countries and regions, has been kept in quarantine since Monday [4 Feb 2020] after a passenger, who disembarked in Hong Kong, was found to be infected with the pneumonia-causing virus.

The government is also working on a request to get medication to those on board who are suffering from chronic conditions, health minister Katsunobu Kato said on a TV program the same day.

The overall number of infected in Japan now stands at 96, including 10 people who evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, at the center of the outbreak, on government-chartered flights. Another 16 includes tourists and a tour bus driver. A Japanese national, suspected of being infected with the coronavirus, died Saturday [8 Feb 2020] in Wuhan. The man in his 60s would be the 1st Japanese death resulting from the virus if confirmed.

In mainland China, the death toll reached 811, the country's National Health Commission said Sunday [9 Feb 2020], more than the SARS global death toll of 774. The cases of confirmed infections have risen to more than 37 000 nationwide.

[What is not clear in this report is whether these individuals are among the original group tested or potentially have later dates of onset of symptoms. If the latter, the date of lifting the quarantine will be extended from the 19 Feb 2020 date. It is also not clear if these 5 crew members had regular contact with passengers or if they were separate from passengers due to the type of jobs they had. We await more information on this continuing unfolding situation. - Mod.MPP]

Briton in French Alps may have spread coronavirus to others across Europe
------------------------------------------
A British man who contracted the new coronavirus while attending a conference in Singapore may have led to 7 other people catching the disease when he stopped off at a chalet in a French mountain village on his way home, health experts said on Sunday [9 Feb 2020].

The man, Britain's 3rd case of the virus, stayed for 4 days in the chalet in Les Contamines-Montjoie late last month [January 2020], under the same roof as a group of British holidaymakers as well as a British family who lived in the village. Five people from that group in the Alpine ski resort, including a child, contracted the coronavirus as a result, French officials said this weekend.

The trail does not end there, however. The disease carried by the same man may have spread elsewhere, underlining the challenges health authorities face in containing infections in an era of global air travel. Spanish authorities said on Sunday [9 Feb 2020] that a British man had tested positive in Mallorca after coming into contact with an infected person in France. British health officials, meanwhile, said the country had recorded its 4th case of coronavirus, with the person catching the illness from a Briton in France.

Senior French health official Jerome Salomon confirmed in a televised statement that the 2 cases in Britain and Mallorca were linked to the group staying in the chalet in Les Contamines-Montjoie. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at England's University of East Anglia, said of the new virus patient in Britain: "This case is part of the same cluster that is being reported as linked to a British national returning from Singapore."

However, more broadly, while the outbreak of the new coronavirus has spread to at least 27 countries and territories, according to a Reuters count, only a tiny fraction of cases -- about 330 out of over 37 000 -- have been outside mainland China.

Tracing French chalet group:
Residents of Les Contamines-Montjoie, a few wearing facemasks, lined up on Sunday [9 Feb 2020] to get tested for the new coronavirus as authorities sought to contain the spread. French officials said they were tracing all the people who might have been in close contact with the group of 11 Britons exposed to the virus after sharing lodgings in the village. Five of those tested positive, including a 9-year-old child and their father. Two other children -- the infected child's siblings -- were hospitalized in France for checks, officials added. Their mother had left the country by the time the investigation began and was under observation in a UK hospital, French officials said. It was not clear if she was the latest case to be diagnosed in Britain.

Spanish authorities said the British man who had tested positive in Mallorca was 1 of 4 members of a family taken into observation on Friday [7 Feb 2020] after coming into contact with someone in France who was subsequently diagnosed with the virus. The family appear to have been part of the larger group in the French ski resort, Fernando Simon, director of the Centre of Coordination of Health Emergencies at Spain's Health Ministry, told reporters. However, he said he could not confirm this 100% because of respect for the family's privacy. The family returned to Mallorca from France on [29 Jan 2020], and the father started to show light symptoms 24 hours later. Simon said the man was currently "in good health" but was being kept in isolation, and authorities were drawing up a list of everyone he may have come into contact with in Mallorca.

[This event highlights the ease of global travel for the virus. It started in China, and there is now local transmission ongoing in Singapore. A UK citizen stopped off in France en route to the UK from Singapore, and visited with family (? and friends) in France; some returned to Majorca, Spain (where they presumably live), with others returning to the UK. With all of this travel, one has to remember the airplane flights and airports. - Mod.MPP]

3 more virus cases in HK, 2 in same family
-------------------------------------
Hong Kong has recorded 3 more new cases of the Wuhan virus, an official said on Sunday [9 Feb 2020], stressing that the new cases highlight the difficulty of identifying those with the coronavirus. Two of the new cases are members of the same family, a grandmother and grandson, who had a barbecue and hotpot dinner with 17 other family members during the Lunar New Year holiday. Preliminary test results for 7 other relatives have also returned positive, and testing is continuing with 2 other family members who had showed mild flu-like symptoms.

The Head of the Communicable Disease branch of the Centre for Health Protection, Chuang Shuk-kwan, says the latest case shows how hard it can be to detect people with the Wuhan virus. "From this family cluster we know that many of them do not have obvious symptoms, and some of them did not seek medical attention. So obviously, some of them can still go to work or because of very mild symptoms they think they're OK. So it's just like influenza. It's very difficult to pick up all those with mild symptoms and isolate them in the hospital and chase all those contacts," said Chuang.

The National Health Commission said earlier on Sunday [9 Feb 2020] that the number of deaths from the new coronavirus outbreak has risen to 811, taking the global count past that of the SARS epidemic in 2002/2003. The number of people who died from SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, reached 774, and more than 8000 were infected worldwide.

The number of confirmed cases of the new virus reached 37 198 nationwide, with more than 2600 new cases detected. The only fatalities outside the mainland were a Chinese man in the Philippines and a 39-year-old man in Hong Kong.

Coronavirus: 7 new cases in Singapore, possible new cluster involving church in Paya Lebar
The total number of coronavirus cases in Singapore has grown to 40.
--------------------------------
There are 7 new coronavirus cases in Singapore, the Ministry of Health announced on Saturday (8 Feb [2020]). Of these, 5 are linked to previously announced cases. Among the new confirmed cases are a taxi driver and a private-hire car driver, it said.

There is also a possible new cluster comprising 5 cases, linked to The Life Church and Missions Singapore in Paya Lebar. The total number of people infected here [in Singapore] has grown to 40; 2 of the patients have been discharged, but 4 are now in critical condition and in the intensive care unit, said MOH in its latest update.

Subsequent test results confirmed 2019-nCoV infection on [8 Feb 2020] morning. Prior to hospital admission, he went to work at Yong Thai Hang and lives in Bedok North.

Outbreak alert raised to orange
Singapore moved its disease outbreak response up one level to "orange" on Friday [7 Feb 2020] after cases surfaced here that could not be traced to the source of infection. Under the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (Dorscon), "orange" means the outbreak is deemed to have moderate to high public health impact, though the situation is still under control. It is one step below "red," which signifies an out-of-control pandemic. Extra measures are in place to reduce mingling in schools, tighten access to hospitals, and limit large events.

After news of the raised outbreak response became public on Friday [7 Feb 2020], items such as rice, instant noodles, and toilet paper began flying off the shelves.

Government leaders have asked shoppers to remain calm. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday [8 Feb 2020] that there are ample supplies. "We are not locking down the city or confining everybody to stay at home," he said.

Globally, the situation has escalated, with more than 34 000 people infected and more than 720 deaths. At least 320 patients are outside mainland China.

The Government has been ramping up its defences against the virus since January [2020], with many of the measures in "orange" already in place before the enhanced alert was announced. The Dorscon system was set up after the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Code orange was imposed during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009. Currently, the Health Ministry does contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with the confirmed cases. It is a labour-intensive task, with 7 teams of 10 people working in 2 shifts from 8:30 a.m. till 10 p.m., 7 days a week, calling people to check if they are close contacts of coronavirus patients.

But if the numbers keep growing, and the virus becomes widespread, it will at some point be futile to try to trace every contact. If the authorities still hospitalise and isolate every suspect case, hospitals will be overwhelmed, said PM Lee on Saturday [8 Feb 2020]. "At that point, provided that the fatality rate stays low like flu, we should shift our approach," he said. This would include encouraging those with only mild symptoms to see their family doctor and rest at home instead of going to the hospital, and letting hospitals and healthcare workers focus on the most vulnerable patients: the elderly, young children, and those with medical complications. Currently, the mortality rate of the virus in China is 2%, but outside Hubei province, the mortality rate is 0.2%.

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 a.m. Central European Time

Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.

- Update on cruise ship Diamond Princess:
On [9 Feb 2020], Japanese National Health Authorities provided WHO with a detailed update on the situation of the cruise ship Diamond Princess, currently harboured in Yokohama, Japan. Following confirmation of a case of 2019-nCoV, all crew and passengers are being quarantined for a 14-day period on board the vessel, asked to stay in their cabins and to wear a mask when leaving their cabin. All crew and passengers are closely followed-up and are medically examined and tested for 2019-nCoV when displaying any signs or symptoms suggestive of 2019- nCoV disease. The quarantine period will come to an end on [19 Feb 2020]. Epidemiological and environmental investigations are ongoing. As of [8 Feb 2020], 64 individuals were found to have been infected with 2019-nCoV among passengers and crew members. All individuals testing positive were disembarked and admitted for medical care in infectious disease hospitals in the Yokohama area. Close contacts of the infected passengers are asked to remain in quarantine for 14 days from last contact with a confirmed case. Thus, the quarantine period will be extended beyond the [19 Feb 2020] as appropriate only for close contacts of newly confirmed cases.

Technical focus: 2019-nCoV training resources online on https://openWHO.org
-----------------------------------
Through the lessons of past emergencies, WHO has learned the value of offering learning materials quickly in an outbreak that will provide critical information to fight disease and protect lives. These materials must be easily accessible in the languages of frontline responders. The WHO has rapidly developed and delivered 2 online trainings to support the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak that are available on the open learning platform, OpenWHO.org. The platform was established 3 years ago with emergencies such as 2019-nCoV in mind, in which WHO would need to reach millions of people across the globe with real-time, accessible learning materials. The courses currently available are as follows:

1. Emerging respiratory viruses, including 2019-nCoV: methods for detection, prevention, response and control: https://openwho.org/courses/introduction-to-ncov. This course provides a general introduction to 2019-nCoV and emerging respiratory viruses and is intended for public health professionals, incident managers, and personnel working for the United Nations, international organizations, and NGOs.

Approximately 26 000 people registered within the 1st 10 days of its launch on [26 Jan 2020]. WHO teams are working to translate the resources into all WHO official languages and Portuguese. Many countries have also initiated translation into their own local languages.

2. WHO critical care severe acute respiratory infection course: https://openwho.org/courses/severe-acute-respiratory-infection. This course includes content on clinical management of patients with a severe acute respiratory infection.

Launched on [6 Feb 2020], it enrolled 3500 users in its 1st 24 hours. The course is intended for clinicians who are working in intensive care units in low- and middle-income countries and managing adult and pediatric patients with severe forms of severe acute respiratory infection, including severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, and septic shock.

The following online learning courses are also in production in February [2020]:
- an occupational health and safety briefing for respiratory diseases (ePROTECT);
- an introductory course on Go.Data (an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection);
- an introduction to laboratory diagnostics and kits; and
- additional language versions of the published courses.
