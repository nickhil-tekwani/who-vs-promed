Dengue/DHF update - Borneo
--------------------------
The risk of dengue fever has been decreasing since 1998 following the
implementation of statewide eradication measures. During the first 6 months
of the year, 185 cases were reported. The highest risk period of
transmission is during, and just after the rainy season. This unpleasant
viral disease is transmitted by mosquitoes that bite mainly in the day.
Reduce bites by covering up and applying insect repellent to exposed areas
of skin. There is no vaccine.

Dengue/DHF Update - Costa Rica
------------------------------
Cases of dengue fever have been reported in Puntarenas and Guanacaste on
the Pacific coast, and Limon on the Atlantic coast. This unpleasant virus
is transmitted by day-time biting mosquitoes. As there is no vaccine,
travellers are advised to take steps to avoid mosquito bites.

Dengue/DHF Update - Dominican Republic
--------------------------------------
Dengue fever occurs particularly in the rainy season. 3 cases of dengue
fever have been recently reported in travellers returning from the
Dominican Republic and 1 139 cases were reported during the first 9 months
of the year within the country. This unpleasant virus is transmitted by
day-time biting mosquitoes. As there is no vaccine, travellers are advised
to avoid mosquito bites.

Dengue Virus Type 3 in Venezuela
---------------------------------
The Venezuelan Ministry of Health and Social Development publicly
acknowledged the occurrence of the first confirmed cases of Dengue virus
type 3 from patients with classic dengue fever in the central and eastern
parts of the country. The serotype identified appears similar to that
currently circulating in Central America. Since 1989, when a large epidemic
of 2 500 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHR) occurred, Venezuela has
reported large numbers of DHF cases every year, and in 1995 the country
reported the largest regional outbreak with almost 30 000 dengue cases and
5 000 DHF cases.
Although dengue viruses serotypes 1, 2, and 4 have been isolated during
this epidemic, dengue-2 has been by far the predominant serotype. The
official accumulated number of cases of dengue reported during the current
year is 8 000 below that of the same period of 1999 (13 000 vs. 21 000,
respectively). Although the few cases of serotype 3 infection identified so
far correspond to non-hemorrhagic types of the disease, the Venezuelan
population has been extensively exposed to serotypes of dengue virus other
than serotype 3 in the recent past: therefore, the potential for a large
outbreak of dengue hemorrhagic fever exists.
