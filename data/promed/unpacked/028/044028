[This area is around 250 km farther south than the previous incursion of
FMD into Argentina last August. Then, the outbreak centered in the border
areas next to Paraguay and Brazil. This new location appears to be in the
world famous Pampas cattle raising and breeding areas. It will, therefore,
be extremely expensive if not stamped out immediately. Also, Argentina's
export status may change in dramatic fashion. Beef is a 7 billion dollar
industry in Argentina, so the economic impact may be substantial -
