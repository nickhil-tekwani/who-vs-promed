People infected with the new coronavirus have appeared one after another in the overseas athletes who came to Japan for the Tokyo Olympics, and big ripples are spreading overseas.

French broadcaster RTL said, "Japanese hotel staff hosting the Brazilian judo team tested positive for the new corona test. In Munakata City, Russian 7-person women's rugby team staff tested positive. The Russian team has 16 athletes and 10 staff. The rest of the group is currently restricted to hotels."

Hamamatsu City announced on 15 Jul 2021 that the Brazilian representative of judo had infected the hotel employees and their families who were staying at the pre-camp. On 14 Jul 2021, Munakata City had a positive test for one of the representative staff of the Russian Olympic Committee for 7-person women's rugby during the preliminary training camp.

The bureau considers that there are a series of new corona-infected persons from the teams and related parties who came to Japan including these cases. "A few days before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics, there is an avalanche of overseas athletes, officers and journalists. The Tokyo Olympics will surely be a pandemic tournament," he warned strongly.

It has become clear that about 10% of the Brazilian athletes participating in the Tokyo Olympics have not been vaccinated with the new corona vaccine. The Brazilian Olympic Committee announced at a press conference on 15 Jul 2021 that 30 of the 301 athletes participating in the Tokyo Olympics were not vaccinated with the corona vaccine.

The Commission respected the willingness of athletes to refuse vaccination, as the IOC does not mandate vaccination. It is a policy not to reveal the names of athletes who have not been inoculated.

In Brazil, vaccinations made by Pfizer in the United States or Sinovac in China, which were provided by the IOC to athletes and stakeholders, have been promoted since May [2021]; 90% of athletes have been vaccinated for the 1st time and 75% have been vaccinated up to the 2nd time.

[A] Surge

https://reliefweb.int/report/world/covid-19-deaths-africa-surge-more-40-over-previous-week


Africa has recorded a 43% week-on-week rise in COVID-19 deaths, as hospital admissions increase rapidly and countries face shortages in oxygen and intensive care beds.

Fatalities increased to 6273 in the week ending on 11 Jul 2021 from 4384 deaths in the previous week. Africa is now less than 1% shy of the weekly peak reached in January [2021] when 6294 deaths were recorded. Namibia, South Africa, Tunisia, Uganda and Zambia accounted for 83% of the new deaths recorded in the past week. The continent's case fatality rate, which is the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases, currently stands at 2.6% against the global average of 2.2%.

COVID-19 cases have risen for 8 straight weeks, topping 6 million on 13 Jul 2021. Over the past month, Africa recorded an additional one million cases. This is the shortest time it's taken so far to add one million cases. Comparatively, it took around 3 months to move from 4 million to 5 million cases. This COVID-19 surge is the fastest the continent has seen.

The surge is driven by public fatigue with key health measures and an increased spread of variants. To date, the delta variant, which is currently the most transmissible of all variants, has been detected in 21 African countries, while the alpha variant is in 35 countries and beta in 30.

"Deaths have climbed steeply for the past 5 weeks. This is a clear warning sign that hospitals in the most impacted countries are reaching a breaking point," said Dr Matshidiso Moeti, World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Director for Africa. "Under-resourced health systems in countries are facing dire shortages of the health workers, supplies, equipment and infrastructure needed to provide care to severely ill COVID-19 patients."

Hospital admissions in around 10 countries have increased rapidly and at least 6 countries are facing shortages of intensive care unit beds. Demand for medical oxygen has spiked and is now estimated to be 50% higher than at the same time in 2020, yet supply has not kept up. A rapid WHO assessment of 6 countries facing a resurgence found that just 27% of the medical oxygen needed is produced.

"The number one priority for African countries is boosting oxygen production to give critically ill patients a fighting chance," Dr Moeti said. "Effective treatment is the last line of defence against COVID-19 and it must not crumble."

Insufficient quantity, disrepair or poor maintenance of production plants as well as challenges in distribution, scarcity of cylinders, personnel or technical skills are among the barriers to adequate medical oxygen supply in Africa.

In a WHO survey to which 30 African countries responded, only 18 countries had included corticosteroids in their national treatment guidelines, as recommended by WHO. Nine countries are including medications that are not recommended in treating COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir.

WHO is working with countries to improve COVID-19 treatment and critical care capacities by providing guidance on clinical management and support to update protocols and train health workers. Along with partners, the organization is also delivering essential medical supplies, such as oxygen cylinders and has supported the manufacture and repair of oxygen production plants.

The rise in cases comes amid inadequate vaccine supplies. The continent has vaccinated 52 million people since the start of the vaccine rollout in March this year [2021], accounting for just 1.6% of the 3.5 billion people vaccinated worldwide. Only 18 million people in Africa are fully vaccinated, representing 1.5% of the continent's population compared with over 50% in some high-income countries.

"The double barrier of vaccine scarcity and treatment challenges is seriously undermining effective response to the surging pandemic," said Dr Moeti. "However, with the expected fresh vaccine shipments and strong preventive measures, we can still turn the tide against the virus."

Additional vaccine supplies expected in the coming weeks and months will help shore up the vaccination rates. Around 190 million extra COVID-19 vaccine doses will be needed to fully vaccinate 10% of the Africa's population by September 2021, with around 750 million more doses needed to fully vaccinate 30% by the end of 2021.

[The combination of inadequate vaccine supplies and improper treatment with ineffective antivirals rather than WHO-recommended corticosteroids is a major problem. Both these problems should be able to be solved. Laurie Garrett (Twitter Laurie_Garrett) said: "South Africa, Uganda, Senegal -- African governments are fed up with dangling USD 2 billion in front of #COVID19 #vaccine makers & being told, 'Sorry, but all our production is contractually committed to rich countries.' Can they make their own?" (from Mary Marshall).

https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/covid-kigali-city-eight-districts-placed-under-lockdown


A cabinet meeting that sat on Wednesday [14 Jul 2021] resolved to impose a 10-day lockdown on the City of Kigali and 8 selected districts across the country from 17 to 26 Jul 2021. The move has come as a result of the current upsurge in new cases of the COVID-19 pandemic in these areas.

The 8 districts placed under lockdown alongside Kigali are Burera, Gicumbi, Kamonyi, Musanze, Nyagatare, Rubavu, Rwamagana and Rutsiro.

"The surge in cases has necessitated a lockdown in the city of Kigali and other 8 districts," read a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office. "Citizens are urged to significantly reduce social interactions, and limit movements to only essential services," it added.

During the period of lockdown only essential services will be allowed to operate, for example, food markets and pharmacies, which will be allowed to operate at 30% capacity.

All schools, higher education institutions will close for the 10 days, with an exception for students sitting national exams, who will be allowed to continue attending school, for the purpose of finishing their exams. Public transport, outdoor sports and recreational activities will not be permitted in the affected districts. Air transport and tourism-related activities will continue under strict COVID-19 guidelines.

Elsewhere in the country, movements are prohibited between 6pm and 4am, and businesses will be closing at 5pm. Inter-district travel continues to be suspended, except for essential services.

Social gatherings like weddings are suspended, but vigils and funerals are allowed with attendance not exceed 10 and 15 persons, respectively. Also allowed in these areas are churches who have been permitted to operate.

In the first 2 weeks of July [2021], Rwanda recorded 10 761 COVID-19 cases and 160 related fatalities.

[3] MIS-C: possible causes
Date: Thu 15 Jul 2021
Source: The Atlantic [abridged, edited]
https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/clues-about-mis-c-and-covid-19-kids/619447/


The USA fell short of its goal of giving at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to 70% of adults by 4 Jul 2021, but not by much. About two-thirds of everyone above the age of 18 had gotten a shot when the holiday arrived, with coverage among seniors surpassing even that benchmark. That leaves kids -- mostly unvaccinated -- as the Americans most exposed to the pandemic this summer [2021], while the delta variant spreads. It's said that COVID-19 may soon be a disease of the young. If that's what's coming, then its effects on children must be better understood.

This month [July 2021], The New England Journal of Medicine published new treatment guidelines for the occasionally fatal, COVID-related condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2102968).

When kids first started showing signs of MIS-C in early 2020 -- rash or conjunctivitis; low blood pressure; diarrhea or vomiting; etc. -- doctors guessed it was an inflammatory disease that occurs most often in toddlers called Kawasaki disease. Now most experts believe it's a separate condition, affecting kids at an average age of 8. No more than a few hundred children in the USA have died from COVID-19 during the pandemic -- compared with more than half a million deaths overall -- but more than 4000 have developed MIS-C, and we still don't have foolproof ways to cure it. But a handful of scientists think they've found important clues about what drives MIS-C. The disease, they say, may have something to do with a dangerous condition most commonly associated with tampon use.

That condition, called toxic shock syndrome, was also quite mysterious when it first appeared, in a group of kids in the late 1970s. Within a few years, it was clear that women who used high-absorbency tampons were also falling ill, with symptoms very much like those now seen in MIS-C: They had kidney failure, diarrhea, and skin rashes; a few went into shock and died. (Indeed, one of the early sufferers, like the early MIS-C patients, was initially and incorrectly thought to have Kawasaki disease.) Doctors soon realized that the tampon-induced sickness was caused by a buildup of toxins from certain strains of _Staphylococcus_ or _Streptococcus_ bacteria. In people who do not yet have immunity to those strains, the toxins somehow bypass the immune system's usual processes for developing a targeted response to a pathogen. That sets off a widespread, confused, nonspecific immune reaction.

The toxins that caused the immune system to run amok were called "superantigens" in 1989. (More than 2 dozen types have now been discovered in tampon-related bacteria, rabies, Ebola, and other pathogens.) What makes them "super" is their ability to short-circuit T-cell receptors. Under normal circumstances, a foreign substance provokes an immune reaction when a piece of it, called an antigen, binds to the nook in the middle of a T-cell receptor. That prompts the body to make antibodies tailored to the antigen's specific shape. But superantigens manage to grab on and connect to the T cells outside the nook. That still triggers an immune response, but it isn't one that's custom-made for the infection. "What does a superantigen do? It comes on from the side," says Moshe Arditi, a pediatric-infectious-disease doctor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, in Los Angeles. "That's why it's able to bind to many, many, many, many cells -- 20-30% of your T cells that suddenly could be bound by the superantigen and -- boom -- activated like crazy."

Arditi has been studying Kawasaki disease for years, but when cases of MIS-C began to be described last year [2020], he suspected they had more in common with toxic shock syndrome. So Arditi reached out to the computational biologist Ivet Bahar, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, among other scientists, to help investigate. Bahar's lab found a resemblance between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which allows the pandemic virus to infect human cells, and the _Staphylococcus_ superantigen toxin. The results appeared in September [2020] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. "This level of similarity, both in sequence and structure with the bacterial toxin, tells us for sure that this segment of spike has the same behavior," Bahar told me (https://www.pnas.org/content/117/41/25254).

However, not every MIS-C researcher is convinced that the spike protein itself causes a superantigen-like illness. "I don't buy that it's driven by SARS-CoV-2 directly," says Carrie Lucas, an immunologist at the Yale University School of Medicine who has studied the pediatric disease. Lucas notes that toxic shock syndrome tends to come on in a matter of days following a bacterial infection, whereas MIS-C often manifests several weeks after a child has contracted the coronavirus. Also, affected children usually show only mild symptoms during their initial encounter with the pathogen. To Lucas, those 2 factors suggest that another mechanism is in play. Perhaps the body creates a molecule in response to the coronavirus infection, and this molecule, in turn, behaves as a superantigen.

Another unusual finding about MIS-C could explain its delayed onset, though. Lael Yonker, a pediatric pulmonologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, and her collaborators found some evidence suggesting -- but not definitively proving -- that the condition originates, weeks after infection, in a child's gut. It's been well established that the coronavirus, or at least bits of it, can be detected for some time post-exposure in people's stool samples. But samples from kids with MIS-C also show elevated levels of a protein called zonulin, which is normally found in the gut lining and makes the intestine more permeable when it's released. If children with MIS-C have leaky guts, that could explain their prolonged gastrointestinal symptoms. It might also tell us why infected kids who develop MIS-C (as opposed to infected kids who don't) end up with spike protein from the coronavirus circulating in their blood.

Yonker and her colleagues wanted to see if they could prevent this damage to the gut, so they tried giving a toddler with MIS-C an experimental medicine for celiac disease that goes after zonulin. "He was very ill," Yonker says. "He was being treated with the standard treatments like steroids and his symptoms kept coming back." The toddler got better: Spike levels in his blood dropped by 90% and his fever lessened. One case can't demonstrate a connection between the drug and the response, so the scientists are now launching a formal study of the celiac drug, called larazotide, for MIS-C.

For now, the fact that SARS-CoV-2 might function as a superantigen in children (as well as some adults) underscores a risk that may be growing. Youngsters who are not yet immunized against COVID-19 would be the most important beneficiaries of a better understanding of this link. "The global sweep of newer, more infectious, variants means we need to remain vigilant," says Diana Berrent, the founder of the patient advocacy group Survivor Corps. "With no child under 12 vaccinated, and the general trend towards abandonment of masking, testing, and isolation, we are putting our children in an unnecessarily vulnerable position."
