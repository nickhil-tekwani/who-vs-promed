[1] Immunologic memory
Date: Sat 6 Feb 2021
Source: Science [abridged, edited]


Reference. Dan JM, Mateus J, Kato Y et al. Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection. Science 5 Feb 2021; 371: Issue 6529, eabf4063. DOI: 10.1126/science.abf4063.

Immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 is highly variable, but protection against reinfection and subsequent disease seems possible in most cases.

Variable memory
Immune memory against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) helps to determine protection against reinfection, disease risk, and vaccine efficacy. Using 188 human cases across the range of severity of COVID-19, Dan et al analyzed cross-sectional data describing the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 memory B cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ T cells for more than 6 months after infection. The authors found a high degree of heterogeneity in the magnitude of adaptive immune responses that persisted into the immune memory phase to the virus. However, immune memory in 3 immunological compartments remained measurable in greater than 90% of subjects for more than 5 months after infection. Despite the heterogeneity of immune responses, these results show that durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 disease is a possibility for most individuals.

Structured abstract
Introduction
Immunological memory is the basis for durable protective immunity after infections or vaccinations. Duration of immunological memory after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and COVID-19 is unclear. Immunological memory can consist of memory B cells, antibodies, memory CD4+ T cells, and/or memory CD8+ T cells. Knowledge of the kinetics and interrelationships among those 4 types of memory in humans is limited. Understanding immune memory to SARS-CoV-2 has implications for understanding protective immunity against COVID-19 and assessing the likely future course of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rationale
Assessing virus-specific immune memory over at least a 6-month period is likely necessary to ascertain the durability of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2. Given the evidence that antibodies, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells can all participate in protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, we measured antigen-specific antibodies, memory B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in the blood from subjects who recovered from COVID-19, up to 8 months after infection.

Results
The study involved 254 samples from 188 COVID-19 cases, including 43 samples at 6 to 8 months after infection. 51 subjects in the study provided longitudinal blood samples, allowing for both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike and receptor binding domain (RBD) declined moderately over 8 months, comparable to several other reports. Memory B cells against SARS-CoV-2 spike actually increased between one month and 8 months after infection. Memory CD8+ T cells and memory CD4+ T cells declined with an initial half-life of 3 to 5 months. This is the largest antigen-specific study to date of the four major types of immune memory for any viral infection.

Among the antibody responses, spike immunoglobulin G (IgG), RBD IgG, and neutralizing antibody titers exhibited similar kinetics. Spike IgA was still present in the large majority of subjects at 6 to 8 months after infection. Among the memory B cell responses, IgG was the dominant isotype, with a minor population of IgA memory B cells. IgM memory B cells appeared to be short-lived. CD8+ T cell and CD4+ T cell memory was measured for all SARS-CoV-2 proteins. Although ca. 70% of individuals possessed detectable CD8+ T cell memory at one month after infection, that proportion declined to ca 50% by 6 to 8 months after infection. For CD4+ T cell memory, 93% of subjects had detectable SARS-CoV-2 memory at one month after infection, and the proportion of subjects positive for CD4+ T cells (92%) remained high at 6 to 8 months after infection. SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific memory CD4+ T cells with the specialized capacity to help B cells [T follicular helper (TFH) cells] were also maintained.

The different types of immune memory each had distinct kinetics, resulting in complex interrelationships between the abundance of T cell, B cell, and antibody immune memory over time. In addition, substantial heterogeneity in memory to SARS-CoV-2 was observed.

Conclusion
Substantial immune memory is generated after COVID-19, involving all 4 major types of immune memory. About 95% of subjects retained immune memory at about 6 months after infection. Circulating antibody titers were not predictive of T cell memory. Thus, simple serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies do not reflect the richness and durability of immune memory to SARS-CoV-2. This work expands our understanding of immune memory in humans. These results have implications for protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and recurrent COVID-19.

[2] Recombination
[A] Mixing genetic material
Date: Sat 6 Feb 2021
Source: New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/health/covid-variants-genome-recombination.html


New studies underscore how coronaviruses frequently mix their genetic components, which could contribute to the rise of dangerous variants. In recent weeks, scientists have sounded the alarm about new variants of the coronavirus that carry a handful of tiny mutations, some of which seem to make vaccines less effective.

But it is not just these small genetic changes that are raising concerns. The novel coronavirus has a propensity to mix large chunks of its genome when it makes copies of itself. Unlike small mutations, which are like typos in the sequence, a phenomenon called recombination resembles a major copy-and-paste error in which the 2nd half of a sentence is completely overwritten with a slightly different version.

A flurry of new studies suggests that recombination may allow the virus to shapeshift in dangerous ways. But in the long term, this biological machinery may offer a silver lining, helping researchers find drugs to stop the virus in its tracks. "There's no question that recombination is happening," said Nels Elde, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Utah. "And in fact, it's probably a bit underappreciated and could be at play even in the emergence of some of the new variants of concern."

The coronavirus mutations that most people have heard about, such as those in the B.1.351 variant 1st detected in South Africa, are changes in a single "letter" of the virus's long genetic sequence, or RNA. Because the virus has a robust system for proofreading its RNA code, these small mutations are relatively rare. Recombination, in contrast, is rife in coronaviruses.

Researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center led by virologist Mark Denison recently studied how things go awry during replication in 3 coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid. The team found that all 3 viruses showed "extensive" recombination when replicating separately in the laboratory. Scientists worry that recombination might allow for different variants of the coronavirus to combine into more dangerous versions inside of a person's body. The B.1.1.7 variant 1st detected in Britain, for example, had more than a dozen mutations that seemed to appear suddenly.

Dr Elde said that recombination may have merged mutations from different variants that arose spontaneously within the same person over time or that co-infected someone simultaneously. For now, he said, that idea is speculative: "It's really hard to see these invisible scars from a recombination event." And although getting infected with 2 variants at once is possible, it's thought to be rare.

Katrina Lythgoe, an evolutionary epidemiologist at the Oxford Big Data Institute in Britain, is skeptical that co-infection happens often. "But the new variants of concern have taught us that rare events can still have a big impact," she added.

Recombination might also allow 2 different coronaviruses from the same taxonomic group to swap some of their genes. To examine that risk more closely, Dr Elde and his colleagues compared the genetic sequences of many different coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and some of its distant relatives known to infect pigs and cattle. Using specially developed software, the scientists highlighted the places where those viruses' sequences aligned and matched and where they didn't. The software suggested that over the past couple of centuries of the viruses' evolution, many of the recombination events involved segments that made the spike protein, which helps the virus enter human cells. That's troubling, the scientists said, because it could be a route through which one virus essentially equips another to infect people.

"Through this recombination, a virus that can't infect people could recombine with a virus like SARS-CoV-2 and take the sequence for spike, and could become able to infect people," said Stephen Goldstein, an evolutionary virologist who worked on the study.

The findings, which were posted online but have not yet been published in a scientific journal, offered fresh evidence that related coronaviruses are quite promiscuous in terms of recombining with each other. There were also many sequences that cropped up in the coronaviruses that seemed to come out of nowhere. "In some cases, it almost looks like there's sequence dropping in from outer space, from coronaviruses we don't even know about yet," Dr Elde said. The recombination of coronaviruses across totally different groups has not been closely studied, in part because such experiments would potentially have to undergo government review in the United States because of safety risks.

Feng Gao, a virologist at Jinan University in Guangzhou, China, said that although the new software from the Utah researchers found unusual sequences in coronaviruses, that doesn't provide ironclad evidence for recombination. It could simply be that they evolved that way on their own. "Diversity, no matter how much, does not mean recombination," Dr Gao said. "It can well be caused by huge diversification during viral evolution."

Scientists have limited knowledge about whether recombination could give rise to new pandemic coronaviruses, said Vincent Munster, a viral ecologist with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has studied coronaviruses for years. Still, that evidence is growing. In a study released in July 2020 and formally published today [6 Feb 2021], Dr Munster and his collaborators suggested that recombination is likely how both SARS-CoV-2 and the virus behind the original SARS outbreak in 2003 both ended up with a version of the spike protein that allows them to deftly enter human cells. That spike protein binds to a particular entry point in human cells called ACE2. That paper calls for greater surveillance of coronaviruses to see whether there are others that use ACE2 and may thus pose similar threats to people.

Some scientists are studying recombination machinery not only to fend off the next pandemic, but to help fight this one. For example, in his recent study on the recombination of 3 coronaviruses, Dr Denison of Vanderbilt found that blocking an enzyme known as nsp14-ExoN in a mouse coronavirus caused recombination events to plummet. This suggested that the enzyme is vital to coronaviruses' ability to mix-and-match their RNA as they replicate.

Now, Dr Denison and Sandra Weller, a virologist at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, are investigating whether this insight could treat people with Covid. Certain antiviral drugs such as remdesivir fight infections by serving as RNA decoys that gum up the viral replication process. But these medications don't work as well as some had hoped for coronaviruses. One theory is that the nsp14-ExoN enzyme chucks out the errors caused by these drugs, thereby rescuing the virus. Denison and Weller, among others, are looking for drugs that would block the activity of nsp14-ExoN, allowing remdesivir and other antivirals to work more effectively. Weller likens this approach to the cocktail therapies for HIV, which combine molecules that act on different aspects of the virus's replication. "We need combination therapy for coronaviruses," she said. Dr Weller notes that nsp14-ExoN is shared across coronaviruses, so a drug that successfully suppresses it could act against more than just SARS-CoV-2. She and Denison are still at the early stages of drug discovery, testing different molecules in cells.

Other scientists see potential in this approach, not only to make drugs like remdesivir work better, but to prevent the virus from fixing any of its replication mistakes. "I think it's a good idea," Dr Goldstein said, "because you would push the virus into what's known as 'error catastrophe,' basically that it would mutate so much that it's lethal for the virus."

[Viral recombination occurs when viruses of 2 different parent strains coinfect the same host cell and interact during replication to generate virus progeny that have some genes from both parents. Recombination generally occurs between members of the same virus type (for example, between 2 influenza viruses or between 2 herpes simplex viruses). But genetic diversity does not necessarily indicate recombination, as RNA viruses mutate as they replicate. Nonetheless, recombination can lead to new viruses with different receptors allowing the virus to jump species. This may have led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population. - Mod.LK]

[B] Viral ExoN regulates the rate of recombination in SARS-CoV-2

ref: Gribble J, et al. The coronavirus proofreading exoribonuclease mediates extensive viral recombination. PLoS Pathogens. 2021; doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009226.

Researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston have discovered what may be the Achilles' heel of the coronavirus, a finding that may help close the door on COVID-19 and possibly head off future pandemics. The coronavirus is an RNA virus that has, in its enzymatic toolkit, a "proofreading" exoribonuclease, called nsp14-ExoN, which can correct errors in the RNA sequence that occur during replication, when copies of the virus are generated.

Using cutting-edge technologies and novel bioinformatics approaches, the researchers discovered that this ExoN also regulates the rate of recombination, the ability of the coronavirus to shuffle parts of its genome and even pull in genetic material from other viral strains while it replicates in order to gain evolutionary advantage. These patterns of recombination, the researchers reported last week in the journal PLoS Pathogens, are conserved across multiple coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, and MERS-CoV, which causes a similar illness, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome.

"The coronavirus exoribonuclease is, therefore, a conserved, important target for inhibition and attenuation in the ongoing pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, and in preventing future outbreaks of novel coronaviruses," concluded the paper's 1st author, Jennifer Gribble, a VUMC graduate student in the laboratory of Mark Denison. "If you can find a drug that prevents RNA recombination, you really shut down the virus," added Andrew Routh, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UTMB and, with Denison, the paper's co-corresponding author. "It's really intriguing in terms of what we understand about virus adaptation and evolution."

Previous studies have shown that coronaviruses are resistant to many nucleoside antiviral drugs, which work by introducing errors in the viral genetic code to block replication. The coronavirus proofreader corrects the errors so replication can proceed. Only a few drugs are capable of circumventing the proofreader. They include an approved drug, remdesivir, and EIDD-2801 (molnupiravir), an investigational drug now in clinical trials. Both were developed with the help of VUMC scientists.

"Finding that the viral ExoN plays a key role in recombination is exciting," said Denison, director of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at VUMC, who has studied coronaviruses for more than 30 years. "Knocking out this function (in laboratory studies) leads to decreased recombination and a weaker virus," Denison said. "So we think it may be possible to block this process with drugs as well (and) that it may make other drugs like remdesivir and molnupiravir work even better and last longer."

In 2007, Denison and his colleagues discovered the coronavirus proofreader. They also found that blocking the enzyme accelerated the rate of uncorrected errors -- mutations -- and crippled its ability to cause disease in animals. Several years later they discovered that remdesivir, an investigational antiviral drug, had highly potent activity against a wide range of coronaviruses, both in laboratory and animal tests. In October 2020, remdesivir was approved for emergency use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

For the past 2 years, Gribble and Routh have collaborated in an effort to understand the role of recombination in the replication of RNA viruses, which include influenza, polio, measles, hepatitis C, HIV, and Ebola, as well as the coronaviruses. Using computational software Routh had developed, which can scour virus-sequencing datasets for evidence of "recombination events," Gribble was studying recombination in model experimental viruses, such as coronaviruses that infect mice. Once the pandemic hit, Routh, Gribble and their colleagues were quickly able to apply this approach to SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that cause disease in humans.

Recombination does not always result in a "fitter", potentially more virulent virus, Routh noted. If during recombination, for example, some of the genome is deleted, the result is a "defective" viral genome that can mix with and disable the more virulent strain. Coronaviruses frequently produce defective genomes, the researchers found. "That could be useful," Routh said. "You might be able to exploit defective genomes as a way of making new vaccines or to perturb replication (of a more virulent strain) in the patient."

Much remains to be learned about recombination and the role that plays in the continued spread of evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 around the world and the ability of anti-viral drugs and vaccines to stop it. That's why basic science is so important, said Denison, who holds the Edward Claiborne Stahlman Chair in pediatric physiology and cell metabolism in the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. "We need to understand the capacity of all kinds of viruses to move between species and the mechanisms by which they cause disease. We need to make sure that there are fundamental things that we know about all identified viruses, their genomic sequences, for example, and some basics about their biology." That takes a lot of creativity, determination, and money.

In a world 1st move, Denmark's government has announced plans to introduce digital passports by the end of this month, February 2021. On 3 Feb 2021, Denmark's acting finance minister Morten Bodskov together with Lars Sandahl Sorensen, the chief executive officer (CEO) of Danish Industry and Brian Mikkelsen, the CEO of the Danish Chamber of Commerce, confirmed that a coronavirus passport will be launched in simple form by the end of February 2021.

The coronavirus digital passport is documentation proving that you have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The news comes as neighbouring country Sweden will demand a negative test result from visiting foreigners as COVID-19 variant cases surge. The simple solution passport will be launched on the Danish digital health portal, http://sundhed.dk and will initially be available to business travellers.

Int J Infect Dis. 2021; 104: 175-177 published online: 19 Jan, which advocated that the IHR (World Health Organisation, 2005), an international convention mandated under WHO, be used to document immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

The IHR are intended to "prevent, protect against, control, and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease, while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. Under the IHR, travellers are requested to provide documentation in the WHO Yellow Card of proof of immunisation by a stamp and the signature of the person authorised by the national authorities to give the vaccine." Such a move would facilitate the opening of borders, allowing travel to occur with greater ease, businesses to reopen, and cultural events to become available.

Abstract
We present a case of a patient who had a history of severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) 4 months prior to this current presentation and, after a long asymptomatic period, subsequently tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by a RNA PCR assay, after several interval negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests. We present this potential case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in order to incite discussion around differentiating persistent infection with intermittent viral shedding and reinfection, as well as to discuss evolving knowledge and approaches to the clinical management, follow-up molecular testing, and treatment of COVID-19 reinfection.

Because re-infection is rare with SARS-CoV-2, this is an important case to examine. The paper includes a table of "Proposed features for distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 reinfection from prolonged SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding", which is a helpful guide, but the differences may not always be clear cut. How long protective antibodies last is important to determine for public health policy and will become clearer with time. - Mod.LK]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (105 983), Brazil (48 707), France (20 586), and the UK (18 262) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 10 103 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 5 Feb 2021 to late 6 Feb 2021). Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Oman, among others, did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (9 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, the UK, Russia (16 627), Italy (13 442), Mexico (13 051), Indonesia (12 156), and India (11 948). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 50 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 14.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 6.4%.
