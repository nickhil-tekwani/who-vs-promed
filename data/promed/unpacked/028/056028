Exposure to rabies up as more animals test positive, Barnstable Village
family under treatment after attack
-----------------------------------------------
With the number of confirmed rabies infections in wild animals in
Barnstable now topping 40, the risk of exposure to the human residents is
growing at a significant rate.
The latest confirmed case came Thanksgiving weekend [27-28 Nov 2004], when
[a man], who lives at the end of a cul-de-sac in Barnstable Village with
his wife and 5-year-old son, responded to screams from the backyard. [He]
saw his wife being chased by a large raccoon. He intervened, and the animal
was soon attached to his pant-leg at his calf, with a little bit of his leg
as well.
It was the family dog, that eventually got the raccoon to release its grip.
[The dog] then incapacitated the animal. The couple then dispatched the
animal with blows from a baseball bat.
Barnstable animal control division responded shortly thereafter and
collected the animal for testing. 2 days later, a call from the state
epidemiologist confirmed it was infected with rabies. Though he was the
only one bitten, his wife and son are all undergoing vaccination
treatments. [The dog] is also receiving the battery of shots.
Charlie Lewis, Barnstable animal control officer, said that 157 animals
(mostly raccoons) have been prepped and sent for testing, 42 of which have
tested positive for the disease. Skunks, foxes and one coyote have also
been tested, Lewis said. Of those animals, 33 raccoons and 9 skunks tested
positive for the disease. All of these cases have been logged since the 1st
[case] was confirmed in Osterville last June [2004].
Lewis said that the positive skunks were found in Centerville and Hyannis,
with a majority in the general downtown area. Infected raccoons have been
found in each village.
When speaking with his counterparts in other regions dealing with rabies,
Lewis said that they are amazed at the speed it has spread here. Most of
Barnstable, 62 square miles, has seen some evidence of rabies.
Lewis maintains a map on which he pinpoints the location where infected
animals were collected. He said it appears the disease is spreading along
the section of town consisting of public and private open space. Similar
observations have been made about infected animals collected in Yarmouth,
he said.
"The worst thing about it," the victim stated, "is the unease that is left
about being so close to the woods." Their property abuts town conservation
land. "In the past, I never thought twice about letting our son go outside
and play. Now I am nervous."
Besides this particular family, Lewis said that there have been other human
exposures and treatments for rabies, but added that the town figures are
less precise on that point because of how those incidents get reported. If
not already dead, animals to be tested are killed, decapitated and their
heads sent to the state lab for analysis. The remaining carcasses are
delivered to an animal crematorium off-Cape, according to Lewis.
The Barnstable County Department of Health and the Environment has
conducted classes for state and municipal workers likely to come in contact
with animals, including those killed by motor vehicles, regarding proper
handling and sanitary techniques.
Sean O'Brien, of the county health department, heads the Cape Cod Rabies
Task Force, which has been coordinating rabies information across the Cape.
Dennis is the farthest east the disease has been detected. The fall
distribution of vaccine baits was completed last month [November 2004],
with baits dispersed throughout Yarmouth, Dennis, Brewster, Harwich,
Chatham and Orleans.
The oral bait program, which seeks to vaccinate the wild population of
raccoons, is operated by the Tufts University School of Veterinary
Medicine, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
All of the local testing has not done too much damage to the Barnstable
animal control budget, according to Lewis, as much of the testing costs are
covered through the oral bait program, with help from a grant from
Barnstable County.
Lewis said the Humane Society of the United States in West Barnstable has
also provided a significant amount of help in prepping animals for
transport and testing.
There have been occasions in which Barnstable police officers have
responded to reports of animals suspected of being infected. Lewis said
that the police department has shot and killed animals on occasion, which
are then properly collected and tested. Sergeant Sean Sweeney, Barnstable
police spokesman, confirmed that the department has assisted in this
manner, but did not have any figures as to how many times it has occurred.

[It would be wise to consider keeping pets vaccinated against rabies. Pets
and strays may not be the cause of this problem, or of the spread, but
vaccinating them will help keep down any further spread of the infection. -
