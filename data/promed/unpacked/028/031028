From: "Joseph B. McCormick" <jbm@pasteur.fr>

Just a word about the seeming controversy of Ebola. The confusion
in the mind of some of the readers, as far as I can tell, is the difference
between the variability of different isolates of "Ebola virus" from Zaire,
Gabon, Sudan, and Ivory Coast, and indeed from Asia (Reston virus). It is
clear that these represent members of the filoviruses which have evolved
over a long period of time, each in their own ecological/geographical
niche, and therefore are genetically distinct from each other, but clearly
related.
This must be distinguised from what happens to, say, the virus from
Zaire, which has remained remarkably unchanged genetically over the 20
years or so that it has been available for study. The same profile of
stability apears to apply to Marburg virus, the first to be isolated (this
is all published in the literature). Thus for a given filovirus the
evidence is that they remain genetically quite stable, and that the
differences we see in various geographic areas are those developed over
hundreds, probably thousands of years (this latter point is not proven).
