I read with interest, and some empathy, the letter by Dr Calisher in which
he mentioned the need for a WHO-type organization for controlling livestock
diseases, to give practical advice and which sends scientists and
veterinarians to areas to assist in decision-making. There is such an
organization within the United Nations: FAO's Emergency Prevention System
for Trans-Boundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases (EMPRES), whose web
address is
<http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGA/AGAH/EMPRES/EMPRE.HTM>.
This organization is very active and is instrumental in informing and
advising governments and international laboratories all over the world, and
its greatest success to date is probably the huge progress it has made
towards the global eradication of rinderpest. Its advisers visit many
countries throughout the world, but its resources are very limited, so its
voice and influence are relatively small.
EMPRES actively promotes the initiatives of OIE and FAO; its scientists
visit problem regions all over the world and provide advice; it produces
valuable guidelines on the management of outbreaks; and also supports
training and research on many global diseases as well as a discussion
forum. The Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright, UK, which is the World
Reference Centre for FMD, and to a lesser extent, VLA Weybridge, are
actively involved in supporting EMPRES's activities by providing material
and consultancy on request.
The UK outbreak has served to focus attention on the apparent lack of
progress in strategies for the control of FMD. Dr Calisher seems to think
that attempts at retaining freedom from FMD in the future are futile
without the use of vaccines.
He may well be right for some countries, where stricter control of imports
cannot be effectively achieved. The biggest problem is that routine
vaccination is currently unacceptable, for reasons of cost and the
inability to differentiate vaccinal from field virus-induced antibody;
countries which break ranks would rapidly lose all trade. Perhaps, with the
right initiative and more support for research and for EMPRES, agreement
and progress could be attained at the international level that could
achieve a more C21 [? approach to FMD control, that may well include
second generation vaccines and differential tests.

I wholeheartedly agree with Dr. Calisher regarding antiquated approaches to
controlling FMD and the need for vaccination.
However, let me offer some practical scientific perspective on the science
necessary for obtaining the required vaccine. If an outline for the process
were detailed, the relevant groups could more efficiently allocate
resources and start working backwards from the end result towards
achievable goals in the short term.
The level of immunological studies required to develop a broadly applicable
vaccine is rather sophisticated, but not necessarily difficult. The desired
vaccine should not be serotype-specific, but rather cross-reactive with all
FMD strains. This requires considerable skill in molecular biology (for
cloning and expression of relevant FMD antigens); virology (both in
heterologous viral expression systems and FMD virology); and immunology (in
deciphering humoral and cellular immunological responses and evaluating
long-lasting immunity).
In an academic setting, these activities are usually carried out by large
groups working on well-described viral systems causing human disease. NIH
study sections in this area are largely limited to testing theories and
mechanisms, rather than practical applications such as preventing disease.
I recognize that this appears counterproductive, but in general, newer
viral systems are ignored in order to stick with well established, well
studied systems.
In addition, immunologists of the caliber needed for a project like this
are unlikely to move away from standard models that have served them well
(and built their reputations) to get their current level of productivity.
Most private companies are unlikely to expend the required effort because
the long-term payoff for an FMD vaccine will be much lower than for a human
vaccine. Animal products need to be cheap to be marketable. Given that you
have resources to allocate, the choice between several years of basic
science for an animal vaccine versus the same expenditure and time for a
human vaccine, it's easy to see why the allocations fall where they do.
As for government resources, NIH has the necessary funds and skills, but as
I've mentioned, their focus is on human diseases, more specifically related
to broad mechanisms than specific issues. A "celebrity disease" or public
health fear becomes necessary to focus resources on specific issues. Even
then, NIH is more effective at seeding the system with ideas and trained
people than addressing the problem directly.
For a good example, compare the NIH approach to deciphering the human
genome to that used by the private sector. Celera started years behind, but
was there at the finish because of radical, innovative thinking about the
problem.
The USDA (as well as other countries' equivalents) is the logical place for
a program. However, the fact that the USDA has only recently begun
culturing for infectious agents rather than relying on visual inspection
does not instill confidence in their ability to grasp the relevant
scientific issues that need to be addressed!
Thus, the critical issue becomes unifying economic and scientific
incentives and directing them towards the same people to get the process
rolling.
My suggestion is to create a program jointly run by the USDA and NIH,
administered more along the lines of a DARPA program [the US Department of
Defense's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Money, above and
beyond the usual grant level, becomes the incentive for qualified
immunologists to move into this area (this is why AIDS became so
productive). Coupled with this is an association with either a vaccine
producer, but more likely a biotech startup in the vaccine field. Vaccine
producers need customers. Having the government agree to fund early work
and then purchase (then resell) the vaccine would provide sufficient
guarantee for a company to allocate necessary resources in this area.
Running the program in a DARPA style would allow for the most efficient
allocation of resources and permit some direction, since we are looking for
an endpoint rather than an open-ended scientific inquiry.
By most standards, expenditures would be modest, while the concentration of
effort would produce the fastest results. Nothing here is inherently
difficult from a scientific or technological standpoint. It's a matter of
bringing the relevant groups and resources together. The people who know
the problem have neither the resources nor the skills; the people with the
skills don't have the resources; and the people with the resources don't
understand the issues.
