No Deadly Bird Flu in Korea Yet
-------------------------------------
Korea's Agriculture Ministry has conducted a series of tests on birds on
migratory routes as the birds reach their winter home in Korea but found no
deadly strain of avian influenza.
The ministry said 50 low-pathogenic bird flu infections were found in about
3000 bird feces samples from more than 20 migratory routes nationwide and
in civilian-restricted areas near the inter-Korean border. But the deadly
H5N1 strain was not among them.
Authorities will continue to take preventive measures in rural areas until
the end of February 2005, as some low-pathogenic strains, like H5 and H7,
could mutate into highly-pathogenic forms.

Flu Virus Discovered in Bird Dropping in South Korea, Government Says
-----------------------------------------------
South Korea discovered a virus that could mutate into a deadly strain of
bird flu in a dropping collected as part of nationwide testing, a
government official said today [19 Dec 2005].
The H5 subtype was in one of 50 samples of bird droppings to test positive
for low-pathogenic avian influenza, said Yang Heung Gu, a veterinary
officer at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, in a telephone
interview in Seoul. Low-pathogenic strains do not cause severe disease in
birds.
Health authorities working to avert a global pandemic of bird flu --
predicted to kill as many as 7.4 million people -- are concerned by
outbreaks of viruses such as H5 because they can mutate into deadly
strains. Since mid-2003, the severe H5N1 virus has infected at least 139
people across Asia, killing 71, according to the World Health Organization.
The H5 virus was in a migratory bird's dropping found at a lake in Ansan, a
city west of Seoul, and the government will take no particular action, Yang
said. "We will act if chickens and geese are infected with H5 or H7
subtypes," he said. The investigation of bird droppings began in October
2005, a statement from the government ministry said.

Avian Influenza Found in Korea
-----------------------------------
The avian influenza (AI) virus has been discovered in migratory birds
across the nation and in flocks of birds in the area off-limits to
civilians near the 38th Parallel.
Most of the strains found are not very pathogenic, only affecting the
ability of poultry to lay eggs. Still, it is feared that some strains might
turn into highly pathogenic strains that could kill a great number of birds.
On 18 Dec 2005, Dong-A Ilbo examined a report titled: "Special Preventive
Measures to Block the Spread of Avian Flu," published by the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry. According to the report, 50 cases of
low-pathogenic AI infections were discovered in 8 areas between 1 Oct and
11 Dec 2005. The discoveries were made after researchers collected and
analyzed about 3000 bird fecal samples from 24 habitats of migratory birds
across the country and the off-limits area near the inter-Korean border.
AI viruses were detected in samples from Sihwa Lake and Tanhyeon-myeon in
Gyeonggi Province, the restricted area along the border in Goseong-gun,
Gangwon Province, Cheonsu Bay and Pungse Stream in Southern Chungcheong
Province, the mouth of Geum River in Northern Cheolla Province,
Haepyeong-myeon and Dasan-myeon in Northern Gyeongsang Province, and Eulsuk
Island in Busan.
Out of 8 infections discovered in Sihwa Lake, one is the H5 strain that
requires the kind of extra care that is usually taken with highly
pathogenic AI viruses. "The H5 and H7 types are highly dangerous," Dr.
Bernard Vallat, the director general of the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE), an organization that monitors animal disease on a global
basis, warned recently.
Professor of veterinary medicine Kim Seon-jung, at Seoul National
University, also warned, "Even if the H5 and H7 viruses are defined as
low-pathogenic, they are much more likely to mutate into highly pathogenic
varieties. So the government must publicly announce the discovery of those
viruses and inform people of the danger of them."
In late 2004, the government culled all the ducks at a duck farm in
Gwangju, where the low-pathogenic H5 strain appeared.
An Agriculture Ministry official promised that the ministry would let the
public know in case the highly pathogenic H5N1 and the low-pathogenic H5 or
H7 are detected during a presentation of its special preventive measures
against AI in early October 2005. But the ministry has yet to publicize the
discovery of the H5 virus around the Sihwa Lake area.
It is in the restricted area along the 38th Parallel where the largest
number of AI infections have been detected. 33 cases were reported from the
area. The result came as a confirmation that the area adjoining North Korea
is indeed a hotbed of AI viruses, because there are frequent exchanges
between the North and China, where AI infections are constantly reported.
Poultry infected with low-pathogenic AI viruses lay deformed eggs or 10
percent fewer eggs than usual, but the fatality rate is low.
Kim Jae-hong, a senior researcher at the National Veterinary Research and
Quarantine Service, said, "Even though people use a general single term to
refer to a variety of bird flu viruses, there is a diverse range of
strains. So it takes more than just knowledge of the type of the virus to
identify the danger. Farms must prevent their poultry flocks from coming
into direct contact with migratory birds themselves."

[Surveillance and planning are certainly keys to being prepared. Avian
influenza is the buzzword worldwide. Further details on the identified AI
strains and their pathogenicity will be appreciated. - Mods.TG,AS]
