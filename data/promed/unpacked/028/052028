The State Ministry of Health in North Darfur has reported the outbreak of whooping cough (pertussis) in El Sareif Beni Hussein locality in early September 2015. As of 7 Oct 2015, 323 suspected cases of the contagious disease were reported in the locality.

Preparations are underway to conduct a vaccination campaign for children under 5 in the locality, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reported in its latest news bulletin. In mid-September 2015, the Health Ministry sent an investigation team to El Sareif Beni Hussein. The team collected 13 samples that were sent to the National Public Health laboratory for analysis, four of which tested positive for pertussis.

A whooping cough outbreak was reported in El Sareif Beni Hussein in November 2013. At least 2 people died from the disease.

[Most of the morbidity and mortality of pertussis is in infants, especially those under 6 months of age where most of the mortality occurs in the developed world. The percent of people in North Sudan who are adequately immunized against pertussis is unclear.

Neonatal pertussis is observed to be especially severe with as much as a 3 percent risk of death. Symptoms can be substantially different with periods of apnea (breathing arrest) sometimes with hypoxia-induced (low oxygen) seizures usually the most common manifestation of infection. The cough is present, but so weak that it may be unrecognized. In these children with so-called malignant pertussis, leukocytosis, particularly with white blood cell (WBC) counts of 30 000 to 100 000 and severe pulmonary hypertension are ominous signs for mortality. In a study comparing neonatal pertussis to other neonatal respiratory infections, pertussis-positive neonates had longer hospital stays, less fever, more apnea, and cyanosis spells, and required more days of supplemental oxygen in the hospital and represented all the infants discharged on respiratory supportive care. - Mod.LL
