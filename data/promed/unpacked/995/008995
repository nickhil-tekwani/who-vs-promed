The World Health Organization (WHO) has attributed the lack of control over the MERS coronavirus in the Kingdom [Saudi Arabia], compared to South Korea which got rid of the disease completely within 2 months, to camels.

Christian Ndmir, WHO spokesman, said: "In the Kingdom, camel is the animal source that causes coronavirus outbreaks, although the virus is transmitted by infected persons who are often in health care facilities, such as hospitals and medical clinics." [but see reference in the commentary]. In contrast, there was 1 source for the disease outbreak in South Korea: an infected individual returning from the Middle East with coronavirus. Therefore, it was somewhat easier to break the chain of transmission there, Ndmir said.

On the WHO plan for Umrah and Haj seasons, Ndmir said: "There will be coordination with the Ministry of Health, as has been over several years, to strengthen oversight and ensure that pilgrims from other countries be notified in advance of the best ways to protect themselves from infection."

Generally, WHO urges all pilgrims to pay special attention to personal hygiene, following health prevention procedures. Moreover, travelers should immediately seek medical care if they develop a significant acute respiratory illness with fever and cough severe enough to interfere with usual daily activities.

[More than 3 years after its initial emergence in Jordan and its spread particularly in Saudi Arabia, the MERS coronavirus reservoir -- speculated to be camels -- and the syndrome's epidemiology are yet to be definitely unravelled. The following paper, particularly its conclusions, may be instrumental in illuminating some of the issues ahead.

Hemida MG, Al-Naeem A, Perera RAPM, Chin AWH, Poon LLM, Peiris M. Lack of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission from infected camels. Emerg Infect Dis. 2015 Apr. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2104.141949.

"Abstract
"To determine risk for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus transmission from camels to humans, we tested serum from 191 persons with various levels of exposure to an infected dromedary herd. We found no serologic evidence of human infection, suggesting that zoonotic transmission of this virus from dromedaries is rare."

"Conclusions [for the omitted references, please go to the original paper]

"We conclude that MERS-CoV was not highly transmissible from dromedaries to humans with various levels of exposure to this infected dromedary herd. 2 other studies have reported lack of serologic evidence of MERS-CoV infection among persons with various levels of exposure to dromedaries, but neither study documented MERS-CoV infection in the relevant animals. Studies of MERS-CoV RNA prevalence in nasal swab specimens from dromedaries in the field or abattoirs have found rates of 0-15 per cent (by PCR) among adults and 35 per cent among calves (1 study).

"A study limitation is that precise events of individual-level human exposure to infected animals cannot be ascertained because different animals were infected at different times over the 1-month period. The timing of serum collection (4-6 weeks after putative exposure) from persons exposed to the infected herd was optimal in terms of detecting a serologic response. However, data on antibody titers after asymptomatic or mild MERS-CoV infections are limited, and our conclusion about lack of human infection must be subject to that caveat.

"Our findings do not imply that dromedaries are not a source of infection for humans. Spillover infection of humans may be more common in other settings in which humans are exposed over sustained periods to animals among which virus prevalence is higher. For example, animals from diverse origins with varying immune status that are housed together in abattoirs before slaughter may provide opportunity for virus amplification and persistence, analogous to that seen with avian influenza virus in live poultry markets. Our study period (December-February) was timed to coincide with the calving season. However, human cases seem to peak during April-June, although this peak may be skewed by clusters of human-to-human transmission. Future longitudinal studies of dromedaries should be of longer duration.

"Our finding that MERS-CoV is poorly transmissible from dromedaries to humans is compatible with the observed epidemiology of MERS-CoV infection in humans, in which human disease is not directly proportional to potential exposure to a virus that seems to be common in dromedary camels. Infections in dromedaries in settings such as abattoirs are regularly documented; thus, the numbers of humans exposed to virus-infected animals must greatly exceed the number of humans with diagnosed MERS-CoV infection. Conversely, some persons seem to acquire infection with apparently minimal or no apparent exposure to camels, even when secondary transmission from other infected humans is excluded. This setting is analogous to that observed for avian influenza (H5N1) virus, in which the virus can be ubiquitous in live poultry markets in some settings but human infection and disease remain stochastic and rare (i.e., not directly proportional to exposure). The biological basis for such an epidemiologic pattern remains obscure for both viruses, avian influenza (H5N1) and MERS-CoV, but the heterogeneity of host susceptibility is a hypothesis to be explored. Further studies on the mechanisms by which MERS-CoV is transmitted from dromedaries to humans, whether by direct or indirect routes, and the heterogeneity of human susceptibility to this virus are needed."
