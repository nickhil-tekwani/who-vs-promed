A fox hunt which counts the Tory animal welfare minister among its members has killed up to 25 hounds following a suspected bovine TB [bTB] outbreak. The Kimblewick Hunt, to which Lord Gardiner of Kimble belongs, culled the dogs and implemented biosecurity measures to prevent the disease spreading. Hunt officials said: "It is most likely that the hounds contracted it from eating meat from a contaminated bovine."

Another 120 hounds are being monitored for symptoms. It is thought to be the biggest ever potential outbreak of bTB among dogs in Britain.

Kimblewick, which has its kennels in Aylesbury, Bucks, has abandoned hunting with its own dogs for the rest of the season. But it has been carrying on legal hunting activities with hounds from other hunts.

League Against Cruel Sports chief executive Eduardo Goncalves said: "The implications of this outbreak are huge. It would be a farce if hunting was allowed to continue while bovine TB is rife. All hunting with dogs must be suspended with immediate effect in the bTB epidemic zone."

Hunting with dogs was banned in 2005, but hunts still legally carry out drag hunting where hounds follow an artificially laid scent. Critics say they often lead to the "accidental" deaths of foxes as hounds pick up a genuine scent and flush out a live animal.

While bTB is usually linked to cattle and badgers, infections have also been found in other animals including sheep, goats, horses, pigs, deer, dogs and cats [and alpacas; see item 2].

The Kimblewick Hunt covers a wide area of the Home Counties, including Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire and Hampshire. At least one biosecurity sign has been spotted at the entrance to the kennels.

A spokeswoman for the Animal and Plant Health Agency, part of DEFRA [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs], said: "The bacterium that causes bovine TB in cattle has been found in dogs at a kennel in Buckinghamshire. The origin and route of this infection are being investigated." She added: "Dogs are not considered to play a significant role in onward transmission of bovine TB."

The Hunt said the 1st signs of bTB came late last year [2016], and it immediately alerted DEFRA. It said in a statement: "We are waiting for Animal and Plant Health Agency's epidemiology report that might give details of the source of infection; however, it would appear that it is most likely that the hounds contracted it from eating meat from a contaminated bovine." It added: "There has been no contact with other packs of hounds since the initial case was suspected, and a monitoring and testing protocol has been rolled out across the country. The Kimblewick Hunt has been working alongside DEFRA, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Public Health England and the Masters of Foxhounds Association in order to ensure that bTB has been contained. No other cases have been reported. Testing continues on the Kimblewick hounds in line with advice given from veterinary and scientific experts during this very difficult time for the hunt staff and their families."

A Hounds Off [an online resource designed to help homeowners, landowners and tenants to protect their properties, livestock and pets from hunt trespass. Hounds Off supports the Hunting Act 2004, which prohibits the hunting of wild mammals with dogs] spokesman said: "With the link between the Kimblewick Hunt hounds and bovine tuberculosis now confirmed, Hounds Off calls for the immediate blanket suspension of all hunting by all packs of hounds pending further investigations and enquiries."

[Though the event has found its way to the media now, according to information released on 28 Feb 2017 by MFHA ("The Masters of Foxhounds Association", the governing body of foxhunting which represents 176 packs of foxhounds that hunt in England and Wales and a further 10 in Scotland), "bTB was suspected in hounds at the Kimblewick in December [2016] (and subsequently confirmed at the end of January [2017])". The statement further says: "DEFRA has not imposed any movement or other restrictions, as it does not consider that there is any increased risk to wildlife and farm stock. However, the Hunt immediately suspended hunting in the interests of farmers and landowners and the wider hunting interest.

"There is only one recently recorded case of a dog with bTB in England, some 4 years ago. The Kimblewick and Hunting Office are working closely with officials from DEFRA, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Public Health England and the Royal Dick Veterinary School (Edinburgh), other vets with specialist expertise in bTB, in order to determine the exact position and the best way forward." http://www.mfha.org.uk/news/37-hunting-news/182-hound-health

The final results of the epidemiological investigations of the described case, including genotyping results, are anticipated with interest. On top of bovine excrement and tissues, other sources of dog infection could include badgers, live or dead. - Mod.AS]

[2] Infected alpacas
Date: Sat 4 Mar 2017
source: The British Alpaca Society (BAS) - circular to members [edited]
https://www.facebook.com/TheBritishAlpacaSociety/?ref=page_internal


The BAS is aware of the recent social media posts regarding TB. The board would like to assure you that the situation is under constant assessment both by the BAS and APHA [UK's Animal & Plant Health Agency], as are the 3 registered herds purchased from the breeder.

APHA were informed in November [2016] of the initial breakdown, which traced back to the originating farm in December [2016]. APHA have been involved since with testing and tracing and continue to work with herd owners who are involved, and BAS will continue to provide APHA with information regarding transfer of animals.

The BAS would like to take this opportunity to suggest that anyone who has concerns or is involved should contact the BAS without delay, who will support any herd owners who find themselves in this situation.

[While dogs, as stated in the APHA commentary, "are not considered to play a significant role in onward transmission of bovine TB to humans," their potential infectivity should not be ignored. Alpacas, on the other hand, if/when infected by bTB, are of considerable health hazard to humans. Infected alpaca can develop remarkable necrosis and cavitation of the lung, as well as disseminated disease, readily expelling the bacteria as aerosols. Human exposure and infections could occur, for example, at agricultural fairs or petting zoos.

Full results of the epidemiological and bacteriological investigation into the multifocal outbreak in the alpaca holdings and information about the zoo-sanitary and public-health-related security measures applied by the authorities are anticipated. - Mod.AS
