A pertussis outbreak in the Low German-speaking Mennonite population of the region is proving challenging for public health officials to contain. The issue was raised this week during a board meeting of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health.

Pertussis, commonly referred to as whooping cough, is highly contagious. Its presence was first confirmed in the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph area on 15 Feb 2012, but the outbreak was declared elsewhere in late January 2012. The local health unit is one of 7 dealing with the problem.

Dr Nicola Mercer, medical officer of health, told board members that since the Low German Mennonite population generally does not seek medical attention or vaccination, fighting the outbreak is extremely difficult. She said public health officials are confident there are many other cases of whooping cough among the population. Immunization clinics have been set up, but are poorly attended.

So far 4 children have been hospitalized throughout the 7 health units. The family in the one case in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph was provided access to antibiotic medications to treat the disease. The family refused immunization.

An outbreak roughly 2 years ago among the same Mennonite population left a number of people very sick. "They continue to have an under-immunized population, so we likely will continue to have outbreaks," Mercer said, adding that whooping cause can cause death. The most vulnerable are the very young. She added that an 85 percent immunization rate is generally what is needed to have a serious impact on a disease.

The hardest hit area so far is within the Elgin-St Thomas health unit, where there are 64 cases. Of the 82 confirmed cases within the district of the 7 health units, the median age of infection is 7 years.

The outbreak is occurring among members of the same religious community, who attend the same schools and churches.

[Most of the ProMED-mail postings regarding pertussis have been related to outbreaks in immunized populations. When an outbreak occurs in a population that does not access vaccinations for religious reasons, the manifestations of the outbreak can be more severe and these individuals can serve as vehicles for transmission to others outside the religious community. - Mod.LL
