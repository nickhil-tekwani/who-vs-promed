A case of polio was found in a 7 month old girl in north western Swat
valley, where regular vaccinations cannot take place due to ongoing unrest,
officials said on Wednesday [16 Jul 2008].

The military has been fighting militants led by a pro-Taliban cleric in the
scenic area since October [2007]; clashes have prevented inoculation teams
from reaching children in some parts of the valley.

Officials said the girl, a resident of insurgency-hit Kabal, has the
crippling polio virus. "I can confirm that one polio virus type P1 case has
been found in Kabal," Waheed Khan, deputy director of Expanded Programme on
Immunisation, told AFP. Khan said preliminary reports revealed she was born
in the southern port city of Karachi and that more details were being
gathered about the case. "Special surveillance teams are ready to go into
Swat and assess the situation, after which vaccinations will be started in
all areas," Khan said.

The number of total polio cases in Pakistan this year [2008] is now 16,
said officials with the Expanded Program on Immunisation. Four of those
cases were in North West Frontier province, where Swat is located, they said.

The government in May 2008 signed a peace deal with militants under which
the militants agreed not to block polio vaccination drives and other health
initiatives aimed at preventing the spread of measles and tuberculosis.
"But the local authorities have refused to carry out vaccinations for
security reasons," another health official requesting anonymity told AFP.

Some 110 000 children live in militant strongholds in Swat that have
remained inaccessible, he said. The World Health Organisation recently
listed Nigeria, India, Pakistan and Afghanistan as the only polio-endemic
countries in the world.

Nigeria has reported 90 per cent of all type 1 polio cases in the world
this year [2008], with the bulk of these from 8 northern states and a 3rd
from Kano alone (see latest weekly case count). It is against this backdrop
that the Expert Review Committee for Polio Eradication and Routine
Immunization in Nigeria (ERC) met last week in Kano and recommended that
the recent high level political commitments in the country be urgently
turned into measurable improvements in vaccination campaign operations. The
committee proposed a time frame of 12 months of intensified eradication
activities aimed at stopping type 1 poliovirus transmission.

The group, composed of international and national experts, recommended that
optimal use be made of 3 new high level political commitments on Polio
Eradication and Routine Immunization: a Presidential Initiative, a
Technical Steering Committee and a Task Force. The ERC stated that these
initiatives should be complemented by mechanisms at state and local levels
to drive and oversee improvements in the quality and monitoring of
Immunization Plus Days and the strategic use of appropriate vaccines.

The ERC concluded that the outbreak is clearly a result of failure to
vaccinate, with 42 per cent of children in high polio-burden states
receiving 3 or more doses of vaccine, compared to 87 per cent in polio-free
states. The group expressed concern that since its March 2008 meeting
(report available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/meetings/14thERCMeetingFinalReportMar2008.pdf>),

the alarming type 1 polio outbreak in Nigeria has grown over 10-fold.
Recommendations from the previous ERC meeting have been implemented
unevenly, with encouraging improvements in some states but large
proportions of missed children in others. The outbreak has spread to Benin
and the Burkina Faso-Niger border, and there is a high risk of further
international spread. This prompted the World Health Assembly in May 2008
to issue a resolution urging Nigeria to intensify eradication activities.

The 15th meeting of the ERC took place on 9-10 Jul 2008, days after the
Federal Minister of Health established a Steering Technical Committee and
Task Force on Polio Eradication and Routine Immunization to urgently
address the escalating outbreak. This high-level commitment is strengthened
by a new Presidential Initiative on Polio Eradication and Routine.

[From the above newswire plus polio eradication website announcement, it is
apparent that the remaining endemic zones for poliovirus transmission
continue to present challenges towards achieving the ultimate goal of
interruption of worldwide transmission of the wild poliovirus. According to
the most recent data available on the Polio eradication website (from 16
Jul 2008), 792 cases have been confirmed to date since 1 Jan 2008, compared
with 294 cases confirmed as of the same date in 2007 (see table below, data
from <http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp>):

Total cases
Year-to-date 2008 / Year-to-date 2007 / Total in 2007
- worldwide
792 / 294 / 1315
- in endemic countries:
747 / 239 / 1208
- in non-endemic countries
45 / 55 / 107
Case breakdown by country
Country: Year-to-date - 2008 / Year-to-date - 2007 / Total in 2007 / Date
of onset of most recent case
India: 298 / 103 / 874 / 25 Jun 2008
Nigeria: 424 / 122 / 285 / 19 Jun 2008
Niger: 11 / 5 / 11 / 15 Jun 2008
Pakistan: 15 / 10 / 32 / 4 Jun 2008
Afghanistan: 10 / 4 / 17 / 3 Jun 2008
Angola: 19 / 6 / 8 / 1 Jun 2008
Nepal: 4 / 0 / 5 / 28 May 2008
Ethiopia: 2 / 0 / 0 / 27 Apr 2008
Benin: 1 / 0 / 0 / 17 Apr 2008
Chad: 4 / 2 / 22 / 13 Apr 2008
CAR: 1 / 0 / 0 / 6 Apr 2008
DRC: 2 / 23 / 41 / 24 Mar 2008
Sudan: 1 / 0 / 1 / 2 Mar 2008
Myanmar: 0 / 11 / 11 / 28 May 2007
Somalia: 0 / 8 / 8 / 25 Mar 2007

As can be seen from the table above, the newly identified case in the Swat
Valley of Pakistan is not included as yet in the figures and may well
represent a new focus of poliovirus activity in a known endemic region.
Unfortunately, disruptions in basic health infrastructure ultimately impose
a toll on routine public health activities. In the case of Pakistan, there
is civil disruption leading to concerns for safety of immunization workers.
In the case of Nigeria, there has been a form of social disruption leading
to interruption of vaccination activities due to rumors surrounding the
vaccine. In both instances there are no winners; the population loses
access and coverage to basic preventative health services. One hopes that
there will be the commitment on all sides to permit the resumption of
adequate services that will permit the interruption of wild poliovirus
circulation. - Mod.MPP]
