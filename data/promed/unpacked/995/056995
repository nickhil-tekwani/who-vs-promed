Indonesia: 20-year-old woman patient is 64th fatal bird flu case
-----------------------------------------------
A 20-year-old woman from West Java who tested positive for bird flu
died on Sun [11 Feb 2007], a health official said. Her death takes
Indonesia's overall toll to 64 fatalities, the highest of any nation
in the world.
I Nyoman Kandun, director general of communicable disease control at
the health ministry, told Reuters that the woman had been confirmed
to have the H5N1 bird flu virus. "...the result is from 2 labs," he said.
The woman had been taken to a hospital in Garut in West Java on Fri
[9 Feb 2007 after showing bird flu-like symptoms. Muhammad Nadirin of
the Health Ministry's bird flu centre told Reuters that the woman was
reported to have had contact with a dead chicken but that this was
still being investigated.
Most human cases of the bird flu virus infection, which has killed at
least 167 people worldwide since 2003, have involved contact with
infected fowl.
After something of a lull last year [2006], concern has grown since
the virus flared again in Asia in recent months, spreading through
poultry flocks in South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Viet Nam. And
Indonesia, where many people keep chickens in their yards, has
reported a number of new human cases. The virus is endemic in poultry
in many provinces in the country of 17 000 islands, where limited
health care facilities and poor communications and transportation
infrastructure add to the problems of dealing with the virus.
Indonesia's government has come under fire in recent days for
stopping the sharing of samples of the highly pathogenic HN51 strain
of the virus. Jakarta argues that the prevailing system allows drug
firms to use these samples to make vaccines developing countries
often cannot afford.
