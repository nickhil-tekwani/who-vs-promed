Mosquito-Borne Disease Risk Spreads To Pilbara Region
-----------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health has reiterated its warning to people living
and holidaying in Western Australia's north to take extra care
against mosquito bites because of the risk of mosquito-borne viruses.
Medical Entomologist Dr Michael Lindsay said that the Department's
surveillance program (undertaken by The University of Western
Australia) had now detected activity of the rare, but potentially
fatal, Murray Valley Encephalitis (MVE) virus in the Pilbara region
for the 1st time this wet season. Kunjin virus, a related
mosquito-borne virus, which can cause milder human disease has also
been detected in the Pilbara for the 1st time this wet season.

This new activity is in addition to recent and ongoing activity of
MVE virus at several locations in the Kimberley and indicates that
the area of virus activity has increased following the widespread
rains in the north of Western Australia over the past few weeks. "MVE
is a rare disease but can be very severe or fatal, so it is important
that people take particular care to avoid mosquito bites for the next
few weeks," Dr Lindsay said. "Initial symptoms of MVE include fever,
drowsiness, headache, stiff neck, nausea and dizziness and people
experiencing these symptoms should seek medical advice quickly. In
severe cases, people may experience fits, lapse into a coma, may be
left with permanent brain damage or die. In young children, fever
might be the only early sign, so parents should see their doctor if
concerned, and particularly if their child is drowsy, floppy,
irritable, feeding poorly or is generally distressed." Dr Lindsay
said people most likely to be affected by the MVE virus were
newcomers to affected regions, such as babies, young children,
tourists or new employees, but anyone experiencing these symptoms
should seek medical advice quickly.

"Wet season activity of other mosquito-borne viruses is also
continuing in the north, with more than 25 cases of Ross River and
Barmah Forest virus infections being reported from the Kimberley and
Pilbara since the start of the year," he said. "There are no specific
cures or vaccines for MVE, Kunjin, Ross River or Barmah Forest
viruses so it is very important that people take care to prevent
being bitten by mosquitoes." The warning particularly applies to
people living, visiting or camping near swamp and river systems and
rain affected areas during the evening and night through the
Kimberley and Pilbara. However, the viruses may be active
[encountered] elsewhere in the north of the State, especially where
mosquitoes are abundant.

"Controlling mosquitoes in most rural regions of Western Australia is
generally not possible because of the large size and inaccessibility
of natural mosquito breeding habitat," he said. "It is also important
that communities prevent mosquitoes breeding in man-made sites around
the home or workplace because these types of mosquitoes can also be
disease carriers in some situations."

People do not need to alter their plans to visit the Kimberley or
Pilbara but it is important to avoid mosquito bites by taking a few
simple steps, such as:

- avoiding outdoor exposure from dusk and at night
- wearing protective (long, loose-fitting) clothing when outdoors
- using a personal repellent containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) or
picaridin. The most effective and long-lasting formulations are
lotions or gels. Most natural or organic repellents are not as
effective as DEET or picaridin
- ensuring insect screens are installed and completely
mosquito-proof: use mosquito nets and mosquito-proof tents
- ensuring infants and children are adequately protected against
mosquito bites, preferably with suitable clothing, bed nets or other
forms of insect screening.

Murray Valley Encephalitis virus, Barmah Forest virus, Kunjin virus
and Ross River virus are all mosquito-transmitted viruses. Australian
Government Department of Health and Aging Factsheets on these viruses
can be accessed for detailed information at:
<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/Publishing.nsf/Content/health-arbovirus-pdf-fsmurrayvalley.htm>.

Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) is a flavivirus. As described
above it has the capacity to cause severe human disease, with
encephalitis being the most notable clinical feature.

Barmah Forest virus (BFV) is an alphavirus 1st isolated in 1974 from
_Cx. annulirostris_ mosquitoes collected in the Barmah Forest near
the Murray River in northern Victoria, and simultaneously from
mosquitoes collected in southwest Queensland. It has also been
isolated from numerous other mosquitoes and from the midge
_Culicoides marksi_ in the Northern Territory. Clinical features
include fever, arthritis, arthralgia and rash. There is a high
subclinical rate of infection and a low disease rate in children.
Recovery usually occurs within several weeks but lethargy, arthralgia
and myalgia can persist for more than 6 months.

Kunjin virus (KUNV) is a flavivirus 1st isolated from _Cx.
annulirostris_ mosquitoes collected in north Queensland in 1960 and
given the name of a nearby Aboriginal clan living on the Mitchell
River. It is closely related to West Nile virus, Subclinical disease
is high as indicated by serological surveys. Two main clinical forms
of disease have been reported, a mild disease and encephalitis.

Ross River virus (RRV) is an alphavirus. Ross River virus infection
is the most common and most widespread arboviral disease in
Australia, with sometimes thousands of clinical cases occurring in
epidemics. Disease notifications in Australia average about 4800 per
year. It was 1st isolated from _Ochlerotatus vigilax_ mosquitoes
collected in 1959 near the Ross River in Townsville. Clinical
features include pyrexia and a rash can occur up to 2 weeks before,
or after, other symptoms. Rheumatic symptoms are present in most
patients except for the few who present with rash alone: these
consist of arthritis or arthralgia primarily affecting the wrist,
knee, ankle and small joints of the extremities. - Mod.CP]
