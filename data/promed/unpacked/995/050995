Epidemic kills more than 300 cattle in Tripura
----------------------------------------------
More than 300 cows (mainly calves) have reportedly died in Agartala during the
past month [May 2005].
The matter has been highlighted by a local daily [newspaper]. However, the
government authorities have identified the disease as foot and mouth disease
and a viral effect [see Mod. comment below].
A member of the disease investigation team that visited the spot today
reported that the disease had taken on epidemic [proportions].
There are many [possible reasons for such an outbreak, including the fact
that] the owners keep the livestock in unhygienic conditions and are reluctant
to vaccinate, even though the vaccine is being provided free from the
government. Moreover, because of the fear that people will not consume milk in
the wake of the disease being reported, [the owners] suppressed the matter.

[Foot and mouth disease is caused by viruses in the family Picornaviridae,
genus Aphthovirus. There are 7 immunologically distinct serotypes: A, O, C,
SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia1. It is unclear whether this article is indicating
that there is also a secondary viral invader in these animals. - Mod.TG]
