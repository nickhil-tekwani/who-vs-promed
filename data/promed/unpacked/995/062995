Prolonged wet conditions have worsened the downy mildew outbreak [in
grapevines] across South Australia's Riverland. Plant pathologist
Peter Magarey says the disease is more prevalent in the Renmark,
Barmera, and Monash districts.

He says growers have about a 5-day window to apply a post infection
spray if they find spores on the leaves of their vines. "Unless we can
keep check, the disease will be taking quite significant crop loss in
more vineyards than we'd like to know," he said. "Where the bunches
are very susceptible right now at flowering, the crop loss could be
reasonably high. Quite a number of vineyards will be under threat at
the moment."

[Downy mildew on grapevine is caused by the fungus _Plasmopara
viticola_. It causes lesions on leaves which later become necrotic,
and it can also affect flowers and fruits. In years with warm,
extended wet periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or
totally destroyed. The disease can cause severe crop losses.

Spores are spread within a crop mainly by splashing rain, wind, or
mechanical means. The fungus survives between crops on infected plant
debris as oospores, which are formed inside the host tissues. It is an
obligate parasite and cannot be cultured _in vitro_. Disease
management relies mainly on preventative fungicide applications
according to forecasting services; systemic fungicides are also
available.
