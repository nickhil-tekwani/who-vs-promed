About 30 dead ducks dotted beaches along the east arm of Grand Traverse Bay [Lake Michigan, Michigan, USA] in the last few weeks.

Department of Natural Resources (DNR) officials sent the waterfowl, all mallards, to a laboratory where they tested positive for botulism, a paralytic condition caused by a toxin. Birds with botulism typically are unable to hold up their heads and ultimately drown. [This condition is often called "limber neck." - Mod.TG]

The birds were infected with type C botulism, a toxin that naturally occurs in soil. Experts attributed the impacted birds to elevated lake levels this year [2014].

"It's over the area that hadn't been water-covered in the past couple years," said Katie Keen, a wildlife technician at the DNR. "The ducks wouldn't be feeding in that area if it didn't have water."

The botulism [in this case] does not pose a threat to humans, but Keen said dogs and other pets should be kept on leashes and away from dead animals to avoid ingesting the toxin.

The dead birds were found on the shore near the North Shore Inn and the Pointes North Beachfront Resort Hotel on U.S. 31 [Traverse City, Michigan].

Keen urged anyone who sees a dead duck to call the Traverse City DNR offices.

[Hopefully, the DNR is picking up all the dead birds. To leave the dead birds to decompose is to perpetuate the situation. As the birds decompose, and maggots develop, those maggots will be filled with botulinum toxin. When another bird consumes the maggot, the cycle continues.

Botulinum toxin causes botulism. The toxin is a neurotoxic protein. The toxic protein is produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism is an extremely potent toxin, one of the most toxic agents known.

While botulism is extremely toxic, it has been used medically in treating strokes and migraines, and cosmetically in treating wrinkles, to name a few uses. There are other appropriate medical uses.
