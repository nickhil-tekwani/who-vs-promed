Suspected Anthrax Death Puts Russian City on Alert
-------------------------------------------------
A man has died with symptoms of anthrax in the south Russian city of Orsk,
and 8 others, including one child, have been hospitalized on suspicion of
being infected with the deadly bacteria.

Epidemiologists in the region have said the infection may have been caused
by beef brought in for sale in the city, which borders Kazakhstan, by a
local resident, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.

Anthrax surfaces occasionally in Siberia (the disease is called "Siberian
ulcer" in Russian) and in southeastern Russia. Depending on the form, it
can kill from 1/4 to over 1/2 of those it infects. While it is not
generally passed from person to person, it is often spread through animal
contact or eating undercooked meat.

10 cases of anthrax registered in Orenburg Oblast, Russia
-----------------------------------------------
10 cases of anthrax have been reported in the Orenburg Region by the
Federal Service of Area Supervision and Protection of Consumer Rights and
Health, who noted that from 28-31 Aug 2004, 8 cases of disease were
registered in the village of Istemie and 2 cases in Orsk.

"The affected inhabitants of Istemie took part in the slaughter and
butchering of 11 large horned cattle without their preliminary examination
by its veterinary staff and the subsequent carcass inspection. The Orsk
loaders [porters] working in the market became ill," reported the Federal
Service. 1048 kg of meat were sold through secondary dealers in Orsk with
infringement of the sanitary and veterinary rules.

Quarantine was imposed on 28 Aug 2004, on Istemie, as well as control
procedures and vaccination of all cattle, the cleaning and disinfection of
stables where the sick cattle had been held, the soil where slaughter
occurred, and vehicles. The following has also been instituted: street
trading of meat products has been forbidden In Orsk; inspection of public
catering establishments, butchers' shops, and meat processing establishments.

Investigation and outbreak control procedures are in hand by experts of the
Center of State Sanitary - Epidemiologic Control in the Orenburg Region,
central administrative board of public health services of administration of
the Orenburg Region, the state veterinary service, and employees of
investigatory bodies.

[Unfortunately this is now a tragically consistent story in Central Asia.
Orenburg lies along the northern Kazakh border; Orsk is in its southeast
corner. Russia has been largely very successful in controlling and even
eradicating anthrax, especially in its western half. Unfortunately this is
not the case in the southern and central oblasts, where the veterinary
authorities appear unable to impose effective control procedures. Reactive
activity, as noted above, tends to be viewed as punitive by the affected
communities, as well as being incomplete and thus expensive in the long
term. Proactive programmes along with public education programmes involving
the livestock sector are more cost effective and efficient. - Mod.MHJ]
