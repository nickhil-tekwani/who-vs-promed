Abstract
--------
There is a lack of data for how the viability of biological agents may degrade over time in different environments. In this study, experiments were conducted to determine the persistence of _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Bacillus subtilis_ spores on outdoor materials with and without exposure to simulated sunlight, using ultraviolet (UV)-A/B radiation. Spores were inoculated onto glass, wood, concrete, and topsoil and recovered after periods of 2, 14, 28, and 56 days. Recovery and inactivation kinetics for the 2 species were assessed for each surface material and UV exposure condition. Results suggest that with exposure to UV, decay of spore viability for both _Bacillus_ species occurs in 2 phases, with an initial rapid decay, followed by a slower inactivation period. The exception was with topsoil, in which there was minimal loss of spore viability in soil over 56 days, with or without UV exposure. The greatest loss in viable spore recovery occurred on glass with UV exposure, with nearly a 4 log10 reduction after just 2 days. In most cases, _B. subtilis_ had a slower rate of decay than _B. anthracis_, although less _B. subtilis_ was recovered initially.

Introduction
------------
Following the intentional release of virulent _Bacillus anthracis_ spores via the United States Postal Service in 2001, a need for effective remediation methods has emerged. Inactivation of biological agents through natural attenuation processes may be a potential option for remediation of contaminated outdoor areas following a wide area bioterrorism event, depending on the type of microorganism, and environmental conditions. For example, bacterial spores are most resistant to viability decay in the environment, whereas vegetative bacteria are least resistant, and the sensitivity of viruses to environmental conditions is intermediate. Further, since ultraviolet radiation (UV) in sunlight is bactericidal, exposure to solar radiation could limit bacterial spore (such as those of _B. anthracis_) persistence in the environment. However, there is a lack of data and a need for predictive understanding of biological agent viability in different environments.

Historically, most laboratory studies of _Bacillus_ spore photochemistry and resistance mechanisms have used 254 nm UV radiation (UV-C), as this wavelength was predominantly tested because of its germicidal properties. However, natural solar radiation, or sunlight, is considerably more complex than this monochromatic 254 nm UV wavelength. Solar radiation is a mixture of UV, visible, and infrared radiation, with only those UV wavelengths longer than 290 nm reaching the Earth's surface. That is, solar UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface is comprised of both UV-A (380-320 nm) and UV-B (320-290 nm) regions, with no UV-C (less than 290 nm). Given that UV-B is more environmentally relevant than UV-C, and DNA damage occurs directly through the absorption of energy from solar radiation, more recent studies have focused on bacterial spore resistance to solar radiation, using either natural sunlight or exposure in a laboratory setting to solar radiation components UV-A and/or UV-B. However, because these studies used _B. subtilis_ spores, the relevance of the resulting data to virulent _B. anthracis_ spores is unknown.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the effect of simulated sunlight (UV-A/B) on the inactivation kinetics of virulent _B. anthracis_ Ames spores and _B. subtilis_ spores, a potential avirulent surrogate. Although a few primary studies and reviews have examined the inactivation of dried _Bacillus_ spores on surfaces due to UV, none have used a virulent _B. anthracis_ strain in combination with natural or simulated sunlight. Further, the present study used realistic materials that are commonly found outside and exposed to natural sunlight. (Most biological agent persistence studies fail to account for the effect of materials or environmental matrices.) Previous results suggest that a material's pore structure and texture may shield and provide physical protection to the spores from UV radiation. Therefore, the current study used _Bacillus_ spores dried onto both non-porous and porous materials, to determine their resistance to simulated sunlight.

[Our thanks to Mary for forwarding this article.

This article is dense with information and so needs reading in full by those interested. The authors are to be commended. But one should remember that it deals with events soon after a surface contamination (no more than 8 weeks) and where there is the benefit of U/V light. Those competing with laboratory contamination do not have this advantage.

That anthrax spores survive well in soil for the 1st 8 weeks is not new knowledge. I well remember Max Sterne telling me in 1972 that in his experience in Natal in the 1930s he found that soil would stay contaminated from a carcass for 3 months to 3 years; experience has borne him out. When you bury the carcass spore survival is prolonged.

If you are handling _B. anthracis_ in a laboratory, swab down and disinfect as you go, with a more rigorous clean at the end of the week. And remember it can fly whether dropped in a laminar flow cabinet, on the bench, or on the floor, or when opening an agitated flask. Remove clutter. And routinely check that you are clean by swabbing and plating out your swabs on blood agar. Yes, it is a pain but who wants to join the Detrick and Dugway fraternity. - Mod.MHJ
