This information is confirmed by the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), not 2 but 3 died. I am quoting the NICD website here:

"The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) was notified of 2 persons with malaria from Doornpoort, a suburb in the northern part of the City of Tshwane [Gauteng province], and 2 patients from Swartruggens in the North-West Province. None of these people had travelled to a known malaria transmission area. Unfortunately 3 of the patients passed away due to complications of malaria."

[ProMED thanks Kris Eale, Public Health Specialist, Khulisa, for his comments. It is surprising that only fatal cases are reported. It would be expected to see more non-fatal cases compared to fatal cases. It is also unexplained how the 3 persons acquired _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in a presumed non-transmission area of South Africa with no known travel history. - Mod.EP
