Update on cholera in February 1998
One more case local case of cholera (M/56) was confirmed by the Department
of Health today, bringing the total number of cases in Feb 1998 to 7. Like
the rest of the cases, a history of intake of cockles was also present in
this patient. The causative organism in all the 7 cases was _Vibrio
cholerae_ O1, El Tor, Ogawa. It was sensitive to cefuroxime, keflex and
ofloxacin but resistant to tetracycline, cotrimoxazole and chloramphenicol.
All the cases did not have travel histories during the incubation period,
hence they were classified as local cases. The cases comprised 4 males and
3 females, age ranging from 26 to 77 years. All presented with painless
watery diarrhoea and are now being treated in Princess Margaret Hospital.
They are in stable condition.
Food histories revealed that 6 out of the 7 cases had consumed cockles
during the incubation period. The cockles were inadequately cooked. In some
cases, they were eaten after hot water was poured over them until the
shells were open. In the one case who did not gave a history of eating
cockles, it was found that raw cockles had been kept in the home for some
time before they were discarded, raising the possibility of cross
contamination with other food.
Investigations and control measures were carried out by staff of the
Regional Office under the Department of Health. The home and toilets
visited by the patient were disinfected. Contacts were screened, stools
were saved for culture and chemoprophylaxis was given to family members. No
contact reported diarrheal symptoms. The source of the cockles was traced
and found to be imported from overseas. Wholesalers and retailers were
requested to suspend the sale of cockles. Health inspectors made
inspections in the market to ensure the advice was well complied with.
Starting from 6 Feb 1998, imported cockles for local sale would be held and
tested negative for cholera before they were permitted for sale. This
measure will be reviewed a month later.
Cholera is an endemic disease in Hong Kong. Including one imported case in
early January 1998, there were a total of 8 cholera cases so far this year.
The number of cholera cases in 1995, 1996 and 1997 were 6,4, and 14
respectively.
