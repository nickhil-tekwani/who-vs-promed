South African Man May Have 'Mad Cow' Disease
--------------------------------------------
JOHANNESBURG: A 27-year-old South African man slipped into a coma on Friday
after being taken to hospital with what is believed to be the deadly human
form of "mad cow" disease, a government official said. If initial positive
tests are confirmed, it would be South Africa's first identified case of
the brain-wasting new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], which scientists suspect is linked
to eating meat from cows affected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), or mad cow disease.
Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Nana Zenani said the government was
awaiting final medical tests from the hospital in Uitenhage in Eastern Cape
province. A hospital spokesman told SAPA news agency that doctors were
confident of the accuracy of the initial diagnosis of vCJD.
Zenani said South Africa had no history of BSE and declined to speculate on
implications for South Africa's meat exports. She said her department had
sent a team of experts to investigate. "They will look at the point of
origin...to see where the infection came from," Zenani said. Agriculture
Minister Thoko Didiza said on Friday it was premature to speculate on the
existence of BSE in South Africa.

'Mad-cow' Victim 'No Threat'
---------------------------
JOHANNESBURG: The 27-year-old Uitenhage man diagnosed with
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) does not pose any public health threat,
Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang said on Fri 21 Jun 2002. She
assured South Africans that there were no public health risks or
agricultural implications that could be associated with the man's case.
Tshabalala-Msimang said CJD was a progressive, fatal disease of the brain
due to an infectious agent called a prion which consisted of an abnormally
folded protein. "Based on the clinical grounds and other tests that have
been done, the diagnosis in the Uitenhage patient is that of classical CJD
and not new viriant CJD (or so called mad cow disease)."
She said most probably the patient acquired the disease from a human
cadaveric graft which had been associated with a number of cases of
[iatrogenic] CJD worldwide. All these cases were traced back to grafts
produced by a company in Germany and the company stopped producing the
grafts in 1996.

No Confirmation of Mad Cow Disease
-----------------------------------
The national agriculture department says it's working around the clock to
ascertain whether or not [variant] Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease (vCJD) has
indeed been diagnosed in the Eastern Cape. Departmental spokesperson Nana
Zenani would not be drawn into commenting on whether or not a critically
ill man, fighting for his life in a Uitenhage hospital, has the deadly mad
cow disease. [Neither classic, sporadic, nor iatrogenic] CJD has any
association with eating the meat of cattle infected with 'mad cow disease'
disease, according to Dr Gideon Breuckner, Director of Veterinary Service
in the Western Cape. The form of CJD also known as variant CJD (vCJD),
relates to eating infected cattle meat. While according to reports, the
doctor treating the 27-year-old man believes it is vCJD, government has
said there hasn't been such a confirmation. Ms Zenani said a statement
would be issued after all the necessary work had been done.
Responding to a report in Die Burger yesterday confirming the disease,
Western Cape agriculture minister Johan Gelderblom said such reports could
be extremely detrimental to the meat export industry in the country. Dr.
Breuckner said the disease could only be diagnosed through tests on the
brain. "A brain biopsy must be done on a live person or animal, or after
death," he explained, adding that no cases of mad cow disease had ever been
diagnosed in the country. He said there were several human nervous disorder
diseases that displayed symptoms similar to CJD. Meanwhile, the condition
of the man is reportedly deteriorating at Cuyler Clinic where he is in the
intensive care unit.

CJD Patient Reported to Have Been Dura Mater Graft Recipient
------------------------------------------------------------
A case of vCJD apparently associated with having received a dura mater
graft is reported in the South African media. [This is a misconception;
only the classsic form of CJD has been associated with tissue grafting].
The patient is a 27 year South African of European descent who is
understood never to have travelled out of South Africa. Media reports are
that the patient received a dura mater graft of cadaveric origin ten years
previously. The patient is reported in a serious condition under expert
care in a South African private hospital.

[There is considerable confusion in these reports between vCJD, a disease
believed to be a human form of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), and associated with consumption of BSE-contaminated
meat or animal products, and the classical form of CJD. The classic form of
CJD is rare and occurs sporadically and is not transmissible except as a
consequence of transfer of tissue (or tissue extracts) from an affected
individual (prior to recognition of disease). This constitutes iatrogenic
CJD. The second and fourth of the above reports suggest that the South
African patient received a dura mater graft ten years ago, a known risk
factor for this form [iatrogenic] of CJD. However, the reports are
conflicting in this respect. It is important to emphasize that vCJD is a
distinct disease entity with distinct characteristics from the classic form
of CJD. The diagnosis of vCJD is only definitive by examination of brain
tissue after death.
Previous reports of vCJD cases occurring in countries outside Europe (which
includes a previous suspected case in South Africa) have proved to be
false, except where there has been prolonged residence in the UK. The
current reports of occurrence of vCJD in South Africa must be regarded with
some skepticism. More information on this case from official sources would
be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
