Mustard gas was used in an attack on a town in northern Syria in August [2015], chemical weapons experts are reported to have concluded.

Journalists who have seen the report by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it found the gas was used in the town of Marea [Aleppo governorate].

Islamic State (IS) militants were accused of using mustard gas during fighting with a local rebel group.

The OPCW report said a baby "very likely" died as a result of its use.

Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said at the time of the 21 Aug 2015 attack that it had treated 4 members of a family who were suffering from breathing difficulties and had developed blisters after a mortar hit their Marea home.

Local rebels said the shells had been fired from an IS-held village to the east.

The OPCW report has not yet been published, but journalists who have had access to its findings say it concludes "with utmost confidence that at least 2 people were exposed to sulphur mustard". The report does not apportion blame, but diplomatic sources have confirmed the weapon was used in clashes between IS and another rebel group taking place in the town at the time, Reuters news agency reports.

Sulphur mustard -- commonly known as "mustard gas" although it is liquid at ambient temperature -- is a powerful irritant and blistering agent which causes severe damage to the skin, eyes and respiratory system and internal organs.

There are growing fears that IS is using chemical weapons in both Syria and Iraq. Earlier in August [2015], the US military said the group was suspected of having used them in an attack on Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Reports of a sulphur mustard attack on Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in Iraq are also being investigated. US officials have suggested IS might have obtained the sulphur mustard in Syria.

The Syrian government declared that all of its stockpiles had been destroyed under a disarmament deal agreed following a deadly sarin nerve agent attack in the suburbs of Damascus on 21 Aug 2013.

[This is a horrible situation, and is exceptionally painful to those who are exposed, most often unsuspecting civilians. Mustard gas leaves scars, and the blistering on the skin is very painful. Since it can cause blistering and pain in mucus membranes, consider the pain of blisters in the nose, or oral cavity, or in the commissures or canthus (corners) of the eye or under the eyelids.

Some photos of the effects of mustard gas may be found at http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3230295/ISIS-making-using-chemical-weapons-Syria-Iraq-says-official-horrific-pictures-Kurdish-soldiers-injuries-caused-mustard-gas-emerge.html.

This article does not mention if this was powdered mustard, possibility indicating it is being manufactured.

Mustard gas, or sulfur mustard (Cl-CH2CH2)2S, is a chemical agent that causes severe burning of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. It can be absorbed into the body through inhalation, ingestion, or by coming into contact with the skin or eyes.

First used during World War I, the gas is effective at incapacitating its victims en masse. Sulfur mustard is generally colorless in its gaseous state, though it may have a faint yellow or green tint. It is most easily recognized by its trademark "mustardy" odor, though some compare its smell to that of garlic, horseradish, or sulfur.

The gas is a vesicant, or blister-agent, causing redness and itching of the skin resulting in yellow, pus-filled blisters. Because mustard gas strips away the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract, victims may also experience irritation of the eyes, temporary blindness, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, and sinus pain. The digestive tract is also affected, resulting in abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting.

Unlike chemical nerve agents such as organophosphates or sarin gas, which immediately incapacitate victims, mustard gas victims typically do not exhibit symptoms of poisoning until 12 to 24 hours after exposure. However, higher concentrations of the gas can cause symptoms to develop within 1-2 hours.

Exposure to mustard gas is usually not lethal and most victims recover from their symptoms within several weeks. Some, however, remain permanently disfigured as a result of chemical burns or are rendered permanently blind. Others develop chronic respiratory diseases or infections, which can be fatal. And because mustard gas damages the DNA in human cells, recovered victims are at greater risk for developing certain cancers. Pregnant women exposed to the gas have an increased risk of delivering a baby with birth defects or cancer.

If sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind.

If sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin. People can be exposed to liquid sulfur mustard by eating it or getting it on their skin.

Sulfur mustard can last from 1-2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions.

Sulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect. Adverse health effects caused by sulfur mustard depend on the quantity, duration, and route of exposure.

Sulfur mustard is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Sulfur mustard damages DNA, a vital component of cells in the body, especially in the bone marrow. This causes decreased formation of blood cells (aplastic anemia) or decreased red or white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia).

Sulfur mustard vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas.

Exposure to sulfur mustard usually is not fatal. When sulfur mustard was used during World War I, it killed fewer than 5 per cent of the people who were exposed and got medical care. People may not know right away that they have been exposed, because sulfur mustard may not have a smell or may have a smell that might not cause alarm. Typically, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. Depending on the severity of the exposure, symptoms may not occur for up to 24 hours. Some people are more sensitive to sulfur mustard than are other people, and may have signs and symptoms sooner.

Sulfur mustard can have the following effects on specific parts of the body:
Skin: redness and itching of the skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure and may eventually change to yellow blistering of the skin.
Eyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur within 3 to 12 hours of a mild to moderate exposure. A severe exposure may cause signs and symptoms within 1-2 hours and may include the symptoms of a mild or moderate exposure plus light sensitivity, severe pain, or blindness lasting up to 10 days.
Respiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough within 12 to 24 hours of a mild exposure and within 2 to 4 hours of a severe exposure.
Digestive tract: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
Bone marrow: decreased formation of blood cells (aplastic anemia) or decreased red or white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia) leading to weakness, bleeding, and infections.

Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sulfur mustard.
