Cattle in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region were found with
foot-and-mouth disease, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced
Monday [10 Oct 2011].

The virus was detected in 7 cattle in the Nyingchi area in Tibet on 30
Sep 2011, the MOA said. Test results on Sunday [9 Oct 2011] revealed
that the cattle were carrying the O-type virus.

All infected cattle and another 132 raised together have been killed
and properly disposed of, it said, and the epidemic has been
effectively contained, the MOA said.

[This is the 24th outbreak of FMD serotype O reported from China since
the start of the epizootic on 22 Feb 2010. Follow-up Report Number 22,
addressing the current outbreak in Tibet, has been submitted to the
OIE on 10 Oct 2011; it is available, with an interactive map showing
all accumulated outbreaks throughout China at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8988.
According to the report, the group of animals involved in this event
included ("susceptible animals") 108 cattle, 2 sheep/goats and 22
swine; 7 FMD cases were seen, all in cattle. The entire group was
culled.

China's data in the genotyping page of the WRLFMD includes information
on 5 FMDV serotype O samples of 2010 and one of 2011. The 2010 samples
were of topotype REA, lineage Mya-98. The 2011 sample is of topotype
ME-SA, lineage PanAsia; see
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/cha.htm.

The 2 strains are known to be circulating in the region. Similarly to
China, in Viet Nam both strains have been shown to be circulating
simultaneously (see at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/vit.htm). It is of
importance to evaluate the appropriateness of the vaccine(s) used in
the region against both strains.

According to China's semi-annual report for January-June 2011,
vaccination against FMD is the national policy in relation to cattle,
sheep/goats and swine, but no statistics are available.

It will be helpful to obtain information on the vaccination status of
the livestock in the affected farm. - Mod.AS]
