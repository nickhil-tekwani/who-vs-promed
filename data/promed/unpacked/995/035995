Sweden's Public Health Agency has declared a specific outbreak of listeriosis during the final 3 months of 2013, with 41 sickened compared to 25 for the same period the year before. "There was a clear increase, which led us to suspect that this was an outbreak, and therefore we decided to investigate the matter immediately," says Viktor Dahl with the Public Health Agency.

While previous _Listeria_ outbreaks have largely been linked to smoked or pickled salmon, investigators suspect cold cuts in the latest increase.

[Although this outbreak is said to have occurred during the last 3 months of 2013, the investigation is continuing (via machine translation of the original report in Swedish that is available from the source URL). The cases in Sweden are said to have been linked to consumption of contaminated cold cuts, but we are not told about patient characteristics.

_Listeria monocytogenes_, the cause of listeriosis, is widely distributed in nature and is transmitted to humans who are not newborn infants by ingestion of contaminated food. Infection may result in diarrhea, but almost all reported cases of listeriosis have invasive infection in which the bacteria spread beyond the gastrointestinal tract. People at risk of developing invasive listeriosis are newborns, pregnant women, people 60 years of age or older, and those with compromised immune defenses.

Contamination of food can occur in nature; e.g., raw vegetables contaminated by soil and manure, and raw milk from infected cows, or contamination may occur following subsequent cooking or other processing. Because the organisms can multiply at refrigerator temperatures, it is not surprising that listeriosis is usually associated with ingestion of contaminated milk, meat or vegetable products that have been held at refrigeration temperatures and eaten without further cooking. A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail archive no. 20071230.4186.

In the US, _L. monocytogenes_ isolates, usually from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, tissue from a normally sterile site, or products of conception (e.g., amniotic fluid, placental, or fetal tissue), are forwarded to state public health laboratories for pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) subtyping, the results of which are submitted to PulseNet, the National Molecular Subtyping Network for Foodborne Disease Surveillance, to identify clusters of possibly related cases. When PulseNet identifies a cluster of _L. monocytogenes_ patient isolates with the same molecular pattern, epidemiologists conduct a preliminary case-control analysis by comparing responses to food exposures reported on the Listeria Case Report from patients in the cluster to those from patients outside the cluster (http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/surveillance.html).

Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _L. monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the Swedish cases with each other and with those of strains isolated from suspected foods would help to establish whether a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source. - Mod.ML
