Tsholotsho villagers have reportedly started mobilising resources to acquire preventative vaccines for anthrax.

Tsholotsho senator Believe Gaule (MDC-T) said villagers and officials from the Veterinary Services Department were working closely to ensure that the disease was checked. "This year [2012], we are looking at ways to stop the outbreak of anthrax in the area after the catastrophe that happened last year," he said. "We are working with the Veterinary Services Department to avoid an outbreak of anthrax in Tsholotsho by conducting wide scale vaccinations of livestock in the area. We are planning on coming up with a system whereby residents from different wards will contribute something towards stopping an anthrax outbreak."

Last year [2011], the government banned cattle sales and movements in Tsholotsho following an outbreak of anthrax which claimed many livestock, and more than 165 wild animals, including 88 hippopotamuses, succumbed to the disease countrywide.

[Anthrax outbreaks were reported in Matabeleland North in 2000, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, (2009 in ProMED), and 2011, with human cases in 2008 and 2009. In 2011, there were 3 outbreaks in September, October, and November with some 98 cattle dying.

The villagers in Tsholotsho district have clearly taken last year's (2011) experience to heart. We need to see more of this kind of resolve, and it is cheering that this was reported from Zimbabwe, a country riven by internal stresses. To control livestock anthrax, one must be proactive and get the stock vaccinated before each year's anthrax season in the areas of high risk, i.e. in places where the disease is regularly seen and within 10-15 km of known recent outbreaks.
