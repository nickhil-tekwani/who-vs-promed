Almost 10 000 sea wrasse were culled at a Shetland hatchery to help contain an outbreak of a common virus in the species.

The sea wrasse had been brought into the islands by fish farming giant Scottish Sea Farms from the west coast of Scotland, reports Shetland Times. The 9393 fish were in holding tanks at Scalloway's NAFC Marine Centre when the outbreak of marine viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) virus was found.

[VHS is a rhabdovirus (VHSV) belonging to the genus Novirhabdovirus, within the family Rhabdoviridae, which also includes _infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus_ (IHNV) and the _Hirame rhabdovirus_ of the Japanese flounder (_Paralichthys olivaceus_).

Detailed information on the virus, its pathological impacts, epidemiology and diagnosis are included in OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals 2012, Chapter 2.3.9 "Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia," available on-line at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/2010/2.3.09_VHS.pdf.

The ballan wrasse, (or simply wrasse), _Labrus bergylta_, a wrasse of the northeastern Atlantic ocean (maximum length of 66 cm; picture at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Labrus_bergylta.jpg) was, reportedly, recently commercially produced in Scotland for the 1st time after years of research and development. - Mod.AS
