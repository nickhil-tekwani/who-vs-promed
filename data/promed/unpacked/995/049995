Test shows 5 Philipsburg elk had CWD
A more advanced test shows 9 of the 81 elk killed at a Philipsburg game
farm last year had chronic wasting disease (CWD), 5 more than the number
identified in previous testing, state veterinarian Arnold Gertonson said
Friday. He also said the disease has not spread from the Philipsburg
facility to any other Montana game farm. Gertonson said the
second-generation test is more sensitive than the previous testing method
available to diagnose the disease, which is deadly to deer and elk and
causes a slow wasting away of the animal.
The newer test was used in the testing of elk recently euthanized by the
state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks at the Elk Valley Game Ranch
near Hardin, a herd having been under quarantine since June of 1998. No
cases of CWD were found in the Elk Valley herd, even though 4 of the 29
adult elk at the site originated from the Kesler game farm at Philipsburg.
The Elk Valley herd was euthanized because the license had not been renewed
and the facility was closing.
Montana regulations require that whenever any game-farm animal 16 months or
older dies, it must immediately be tested for chronic wasting disease.
Since April 1999, 560 samples have been submitted from 41 game farms.
"No elk other than the 9 from the one facility in Philipsburg have been
diagnosed with CWD," Gertonson said. "The Kesler facility in Philipsburg
did not provide elk to any other Montana alternative livestock facility
except the Elk Valley Game Ranch, where all elk recently tested negative
for the disease. Therefore it appears the Kesler facility did not spread
the disease to any other facility in Montana."
In February, the state veterinarian ordered a 5-year surveillance under
which no deer or elk can be imported into Montana without first having been
under continuous surveillance for CWD for 5 years.
The animal also must have lived within a captive herd where no case of the
disease has been found for 5 years. Montana regulations are the strongest
in the nation, and other states are considering adopting them, Gertonson
indicated. The Montana Legislature this year enacted a moratorium on the
licensing of any new game farms until a live-animal test for CWD can be
developed.
