Papua New Guinea's (PNG) K 50 million [USD 17 million] potato industry is
expected to bounce back this year [2008] after it was hit by the potato
late blight disease (PLB). The PNG government body Fresh Produce
Development Agency [FPDA] is forecasting a full recovery of the industry
this year after the disease wiped out most of the crop's seed base in PNG's
Highlands region since its discovery in Enga province in 2003. The agency
said a quick intervention program put in place with the support of partner
agencies National Agricultural Research Institute and National Agriculture
Quarantine Inspection Authority, fresh food and agriculture-oriented
companies Alele, Chemica and Farmset, and donors NZAID and AusAID ensured
the industry did not face total ruin.

Upon its discovery in Enga and its spread to the Western Highlands,
Southern Highlands, Simbu, and Eastern Highlands between February and April
last year [2007], the agency decided to divert all its resources to the
eradication of the disease. "FPDA management committed the organization to
fight the disease by redirecting funds," said FPDA Manager (production and
supply division) Robert Lutulele. He added that the agency's elite potato
seed production program had enabled over 100 000 households in the PNG
Highlands to grow the crop before the outbreak of the disease.

Potato prices in PNG supermarkets reached a high of K 10 [USD 3.34] per
kilogram but have dropped to K 5 [USD 1.67] per kilogram. While the disease
nearly destroyed the industry, Lutulele said the outbreak enabled the
agency to gain experience on how to combat future threats. "FPDA has gained
a wealth of experience from this problem and is now consolidating the local
production base and systems to strengthen the industry from succumbing to
adverse biophysical factors in future," he added.

The agency's seed program currently covers over 20 certified seed growers
living in the Southern, Western and Eastern Highlands provinces, unlike the
pre-PLB period when it had 80 seed growers. Lutulele is adamant the PNG
potato industry will return to its "glory days" prior to the PLB outbreak
and could surpass its production targets in 2010. "FPDA is committed as
ever to bringing back the industry because it serves many rural farmers,"
he said.

[Potato late blight is caused by the fungus _Phytophthora infestans_, which
can also infect other solanaceous crops such as tomato or eggplant. It is
one of the most important potato diseases worldwide, with reported yield
losses of up to 75 per cent. It affects leaves as well as tubers and is
favoured by cool, moist conditions. The fungus is spread by plant material
(including seed tubers), wind and water, and solanaceous weeds can serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Other fungi and bacteria often invade blight-infected
tubers resulting in total tuber breakdown.

Worldwide, considerable variation in aggressiveness between different
isolates of _P. infestans_ has been observed. A severe form of PLB was
responsible for the Irish potato famine in the late 1840s. PLB is a concern
in many countries because new and even more virulent strains continue to
emerge. Some of these can destroy a potato plant in a matter of hours and a
complete crop within days. There are 2 mating types of the fungus, A1 and
A2. Where both are present, reproduction occurs sexually as well as
asexually, increasing the chances of strains with higher fungicide
resistance and increased yield losses to evolve.

A1 has spread worldwide; A2 is currently present in northern Europe,
northern and Central America, and parts of Asia.

Disease management includes preventative fungicide treatments of seed
tubers as well as fungicide sprays of crops. PLB-resistant potato varieties
are available, and more are being developed for use in specific areas. A
lack of adequate seed tuber treatments has been responsible for a number of
outbreaks, especially in developing countries, and may also have triggered
the current epidemic in PNG.

Fungi of the genus _Phytophthora_ (ancient Greek: "plant destroyer") are
found worldwide, and many species belong to the most aggressive and most
important plant pathogens. The fungi are associated with serious blight and
rotting disease in a range of crops; for example: _P. palmivora_ (more than
150 tropical host species; budrot of palms, cocoa black pod); _P. capsici_
(more than 50 host species including cucurbit and solanaceous vegetable
crops); _P. megakarya_ (cocoa black pod); _P. sojae_ (root and stem rot,
soybean) _P. nicotianae_ and _P. citrophthora_ (citrus root rot); _P.
fragariae_ (wilt and root rot of berry crops). _P. cinnamomi_ has caused
immeasurable damage to native vegetation, natural environments and habitats
in Australia. _P. kernoviae_ and _P. ramorum_ are considered serious
pathogens of native trees and shrubs and introduced ornamentals in Europe.
Synergistic interactions with climatic extremes are considered a major
cause for general decline of forests.
