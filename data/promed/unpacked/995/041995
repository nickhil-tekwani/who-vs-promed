The Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] has confirmed the presence of what it's calling a high pathogenic [HP] Avian Influenza [AI], subtype H5N1, at an exhibition farm on the Avalon Peninsula.

The farm does not produce birds for sale.

The federal agency says the provincial department and the owner are working with CFIA to manage the situation.

The infected birds were located on the farm, which contains a variety of other species of animals. No other cases resembling Avian Flu have been reported in the vicinity of the farm.

The CFIA says Avian Flu circulates naturally in birds and recent detections of high pathogenic AI in Europe indicate an even higher risk of the disease in North American poultry this year [2021].

The federal agency says it is important anyone raising poultry remain vigilant against AI and ensure they have effective biosecurity measures in place.

OFFLU statement on outbreak of H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza in Newfoundland, Canada
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The recent detection of an H5N1 high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus in Newfoundland, Canada represents the first identification of goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage (Gs/GD/96) H5 HPAI virus in the Americas since June 2015. This is cause for concern for wild birds, zoological collections, and poultry in the Americas(1). Some east coast states of the United States of America (USA) are home to very large poultry populations that could be at risk of exposure and outbreaks in the next few months. This finding raises concerns about the potential of this virus becoming established in the Americas within migratory and resident birds.

Epidemiological information on the HPAI outbreak is limited. It involved an exhibition farm in St John's on the Avalon Peninsula and resulted in the death of 360 of 409 mixed species of birds (layers, geese, ducks, silkie hens, peafowl, turkeys) kept on the farm. Full genome sequence of the virus was obtained from 9 clinical samples collected from the infected premises. Based on BLAST analysis all 8 gene segments of the virus are of Eurasian origin. The virus has been confirmed as a clade 2.3.4.4b H5N1 virus, phylogenetically all 8 gene segments of the virus are related to 2.3.4.4b clade H5N1 virus currently circulating widely in wild birds and poultry in Europe. The outbreak commenced on 9 Dec 2021. This is the first time that a clade 2.3.4.4b virus within the goose/Guangdong/1/96-lineage (Gs/GD/96) has been detected in the Americas. The remaining birds in the farm were depopulated and the Canadian authorities are continuing investigations, including additional testing of wild birds and poultry in the area.

High pathogenicity Gs/GD/96-lineage H5 virus was last introduced to North America in late 2014 and caused the largest animal health emergency in the USA during 2015. That virus arrived from Asia across the Bering Strait, belonged to clade 2.3.4.4c, and, initially, affected birds on the west coast of Canada and the USA. The current Newfoundland outbreak represents a new introduction of a different, but phylogenetically related, high pathogenicity virus. This virus lineage has shown to be capable of being carried over long distances by migratory birds, based on experiences from Eurasia and Africa.

It has been recognised for some time that, although avian influenza viruses tend to be classified into North American and Eurasian lineages, viral genes and, on occasions, whole viruses can cross the Atlantic divide (Dusek et al., 2014). The introduction of a Gs/GD/96-lineage H5 HPAI via this route was considered possible previously (Sims et al., 2017). We postulate that a wild bird introduction might have occurred in the current outbreak (direct or indirect), although other pathways cannot be ruled out. If this is the result of wild bird introduction, experiences from Eurasia suggest that rapid and wide dispersal of the virus could occur. There are few poultry in the Maritime provinces of Canada, which means there is a limited population of susceptible poultry that could provide a warning of wider transmission of the virus by wild birds.

We urge all countries in the Americas and Caribbean to increase surveillance of wild birds and poultry for any evidence of infection with this virus, and, also, advise poultry producers and keepers of other types of birds to implement stricter biosecurity measures until more information becomes available.

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a serious situation.

"AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: the hemagglutinin or H proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or N proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many strains of avian influenza (AI) virus exist worldwide. These viruses affect chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl as well as a wide variety of free-flying species. Migratory waterfowl have been shown to be a natural reservoir for AI. AI strains also are divided into 2 groups based upon the ability of the virus to produce disease.

"Low Pathogenicity or "low path" Avian Influenza (LPAI)
LPAI occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds. In most cases it causes no signs of infection or only minor symptoms in birds. These strains of the disease pose little significant threat to human health. These strains are common in the U.S. and around the world.

"Highly Pathogenicity or "high path" Avian Influenza (HPAI)
HPAI is often fatal in chickens and turkeys. HPAI spreads rapidly and has a higher death rate in birds than LPAI. HPAI has been detected and eradicated 3 times in U.S. domestic poultry. HPAI H5N1 is the subtype rapidly spreading in some parts of the world. Most of the highly pathogenic AI viruses fall under types H5 or H7; however, most AI infections, including those typed as H5 or H7, are clinically of low pathogenicity. These typically produce few or no clinical signs in affected birds. Sometimes the only evidence of this virus is a minor increase in bird mortality. Aside from the possible mutation of low-pathogenicity strains under field conditions into high-pathogenicity strains, the presence of low-pathogenicity virus can also result in restrictions on exports and serious repercussions on the production economy. Avian Influenza of H5 and H7 subtypes are known as Notifiable Avian Influenza (NAI). APHIS works to keep NAI from becoming established in U.S. poultry populations.

"Identifying Infected Birds
Birds infected with the HPAI virus may show one or more of the following signs:
• Sudden death without clinical signs;
• Lack of energy and appetite;
• Decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs;
• Swelling of head, comb, eyelid, wattles, and hocks;
• Purple discoloration of wattles, comb, and legs;
• Nasal discharge, coughing, and sneezing;
• Incoordination; or
• Diarrhea.

"Epidemiology
HPAI can strike poultry quickly and spread rapidly from premises to premises. Migratory waterfowl can introduce the disease to U.S. poultry. International visitors or smuggled birds are also risk factors. Once introduced, the disease spreads from bird to bird by direct contact or through contact with contaminated manure, equipment, vehicles, crates, and the clothing or shoes of individuals who have come in contact with the virus. The virus remains viable in the environment for long periods, particularly at lower temperatures, and it can survive indefinitely in frozen material.

"Biosecurity Measures on the Farm
Veterinarians should work with poultry producers to strengthen biosecurity practices. Established and enforced biosecurity protocols will help prevent introduction of HPAI and other infectious agents. Recommended biosecurity measures include
• Establishing an "all-in, all-out" flock-management policy;
• Protecting against exposure to wild birds or water or ground contaminated by wild birds;
• Closing bird areas to nonessential personnel or vehicles;
• Providing employees with clean clothing and disinfection facilities and directions for their use;
• Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting equipment and vehicles (including tires and undercarriage) when entering or leaving the farm;
• Banning the borrowing or lending of equipment or vehicles;
• Banning visits to other poultry farms, exhibitions, fairs, and sales or swap meets (if visits must occur, direct workers to change footwear and clothing on their return); and
• Banning bringing birds in slaughter channels back to the farm.

"Reporting Suspicious Diseases
Practitioners are encouraged to educate their poultry clientele and pet bird owners to report all signs of disease. If signs of disease resemble AI or cannot be diagnosed, they should immediately be reported to both the Assistant District Director and the State Animal Health Official."
