Tanzania: State of Rift Valley fever spread bad
-----------------------------------------------
Many of the Rift Valley fever (RVF) patients admitted to hospitals
and health centres here are in critical condition, Dodoma Regional
Commissioner (RC) William Lukuvi has revealed. He made the revelation
in remarks on his recent tour of health facilities across the region
to assess the magnitude of the epidemic, which has claimed a national
total of 33 lives. The RC was addressing a meeting of guest house and
hotel owners here on Tuesday [10 Apr 2007], amid reports that the
deadly viral disease was digging in.
Dodoma is the region worst hit by the RVF outbreak, and Lukuvi
appealed to government officials, business people, owners of guest
houses and members of the public to step up measures to help prevent
the spread of the disease. "We cannot enjoy ourselves while our
voters are suffering. We have to relieve them of the problem,"
observed the RC, his appeal coming at a time when the National
Assembly is ending the 1st half of its ordinary 2-week meeting here.
Giving what he said were the latest figures, Lukuvi said the region
has 56 RVF patients admitted to health facilities, adding: "The
situation is critical. Some patients have been confined to hospital
beds for months but still show few signs of getting better." The RC
explained that most patients are unconscious, some having been in bed
for over 2 months, noting, "Medical officers and other staff are
doing what best they can do to arrest the situation but things remain
bad indeed. Those religious leaders endowed with God's healing powers
should pray for those (RVF) patients who have lost the ability to
pray for themselves."
Meanwhile, Lukuvi used the occasion to order authorities in the
region to arrest anyone found eating meat that veterinary experts
have not screened and passed as fit for human consumption. There have
been reports of some bars and restaurants here selling roast meat
despite a government ban and countrywide public education campaign
meant to alert wananchi ["citizen" in Swahili] against such behavior.
RVF is an acute, fever-causing viral disease that affects both
livestock and humans. It hit parts of northern Tanzania in February
[2007] after filtering in from Kenya, leading to human and animal
deaths and threatening the livelihood of pastoralist communities in
both countries. The Nairobi (Kenya)-based Centre for Disease Control
confirmed the presence of RVF in Tanzania on 1 Feb 2007after testing
samples collected by the Livestock Development Ministry in Arusha.
Abortions feared to be RVF-induced have been reported among livestock
herds in Kilosa, Tarime, Monduli and Simanjiro districts.
Joint response and control measures are overseen and coordinated by
the Livestock Development and Health and Social Welfare ministries,
local governments and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). However,
quarantines and livestock deaths threaten to prevent pastoralists
from benefiting from the ongoing rains and the resultant good pasture
conditions.
The government is planning to spend an estimated 15bn/- [USD 11 888
250] fighting RVF and 1.7bn/- [USD 1 347 335] has already been spent
on ordering vaccines from abroad, Prime Minister Edward Lowassa and
Livestock Development minister Anthony Diallo said recently. As of 31
Mar this year [2007], 200 441 head of cattle, 81 945 goats and 37 773
sheep had showed RVF symptoms around the country. Reports released a
few weeks after the outbreak said 568 head of cattle, 1063 goats and
434 sheep had died after developing symptoms similar to those of RVF.

Tanzania: Vice-president commends Rift Valley fever efforts
-----------------------------------------------------------
Vice-president Dr. Ali Mohammed Shein has commended efforts to
contain Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the Dodoma region. Dr. Shein made
the remarks yesterday [Fri 13 Apr 2007] when he visited Dodoma
Regional Hospital where he had gone to see RVF patients who are being
treated there.
The Dodoma Regional Commissioner, Mr. William Lukuvi, said here
yesterday that among the measures being taken include sensitising the
public about the disease and possible ways of fighting it. Briefing
the vice-president, Mr. Lukuvi further said that they have already
supplied [livestock] vaccination doses to districts; they are
supervising bathing of livestock, destroying mosquito breeding
grounds and enhancing efforts to keep the city clean.
The measures, he said, have proved successful as the number of
patients has been declining and until yesterday [13 Apr 2007]only one
person is reported to have been taken to the regional hospital. "The
number of patients that are continuing with treatment in several
health centres stands at 53 out now," he said. Since the outbreak of
the disease in the region, there have been 115 patients out of whom
37 died and 25 were treated and discharged, he said.
He thanked the prime minister's office for extending 300m/- [USD 237
765] to the region which will assist in the fight against the disease
and accelerate the implementation of strategies of containing the disease.
He also thanked the Tanzania Red Cross Society for sponsoring the
training of 56 villagers who will sensitise their communities and for
also handing out 200 mosquito nets and blankets.

[Dr. Dudley has pointed out significant discrepancies between these
press reports. The 1st report gives the mortality as 33, whereas the
Daily News report gives the mortality as 37. Furthermore the accounts
of the nature of the human patients illness are discordant. In the
1st report it is claimed that some patients have been confined to
hospital beds for months and are still showing few signs of
improvement Most patients are unconscious, some having been in bed
for more than 2 months. By contrast the 2nd report states that of 115
patients treated, 37 had died, 25 had been discharged and 53 remained
under treatment, making the case fatality rate (CFR) 32 percent on
the basis of these figures.
Mod.JW has commented that an earlier ProMED-mail post (see: Rift
Valley fever, Eastern Africa (26): Kenya 20070329.1083) on the
current RVF outbreak in East Africa stated that 5 patients died after
developing meningo-encephalitis, a condition linked to post-recovery,
a nervous system and brain disorder that attacks those who had
contracted RVF but were discharged after recovery. Of 354 people
infected at the height of the fever outbreak 106 died, again giving a
high CFR. These very late complications and high CFR deserve further
investigation since meningo-encephalitis is supposed to follow the
febrile phase in 5-10 days.

[Subscribers are referred to Dr Glyn Davies's comprehensive
explanatory commentary on the Tanzanian RVF situation in animals,
included in an archived ProMED-mail post 20070324.1024. One of his
main remarks addressed the vaccination of exposed livestock during
the peak of an outbreak, a procedure regarded by him to be highly
contraindicated.
The proper time for vaccination was immediately following the
publication of FAO's warning on the possible RVF activity in the Horn
of Africa, distributed in November 2006, prior to the onset of the
epizootic (see at
