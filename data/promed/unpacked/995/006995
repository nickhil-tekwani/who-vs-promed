This year's H7N9 bird flu virus in China has several features that point to pandemic potential, according to studies in animal models. Since March [2013], the H7N9 avian influenza virus has infected at least 132 and killed 37 people in China. Humans lack protective immune responses to it, which raises concerns about its potential to spark a worldwide outbreak or pandemic. To learn more about how the virus spreads and infects, researchers in the US and Japan analyzed 2 samples of the virus from patients in China and studied its ability to infect and replicate in ferrets -- standard models for studying flu in mammals because like mammals, they infect one another through coughs and sneezes. "The robust replicative ability in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates and the limited transmissibility in ferrets of Anhui/1 suggest that A(H7N9) viruses have pandemic potential," Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Tokyo and his co-authors concluded in Wednesday's [10 Jul 2013] issue of the journal Nature (see part [3] below).

A 2nd flu paper published on Tuesday [9 Jul 2013] in the journal mBio also looked at H7N9's human pandemic potential. In the 94-year history of studying H7 flu viruses in animals, the viruses have never caused human pandemics. But the history isn't reassuring when several usual features of the viruses are considered, scientists from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said. Other H7 viruses have caused large-scale epidemics among poultry in New York, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, and Italy. They have infected mammals including humans, study authors David Morens, Jeffery Taubenberger and Anthony Fauci said. In humans, H7 viruses tend to infect conjunctival cells, leading to signs and symptoms in the eyes such as itching, swelling and [causing tears] that in theory could promote spread between people. Other H7 viruses are able to infect mammals such as horses and pigs.

"The history of H7 viruses constitutes a set of complex observations that may or may not be relevant to the emergence of an H7N9 pandemic, and we thus find it challenging to fit them into calculations of potential human risk," they wrote. "Regardless of whether the current H7N9 outbreak dies out or proceeds to pandemic potential, we have a unique opportunity to learn more of influenza's many secrets and thereby enhance our ability to prevent and control an important disease that seems destined to appear again and again, in multiple guises, far into the foreseeable future."

Analysis of H7N9 Viruses' Disease Characteristics and Transmissibility
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A study published today [10 Jul 2013] in Nature by CDC researchers (see part [3] below) presents findings from animal studies conducted by the CDC to better understand the transmissibility and disease characteristics of influenza A(H7N9) viruses isolated in China in late March [2013]. Understanding the properties of H7N9 viruses that contribute to human disease and the capacity of these viruses to spread between people is a critical component of the public health response to this emerging disease threat.

The study's key findings indicate that H7N9 viruses are capable of causing infection in a direct contact animal model, but the viruses would need to undergo additional adaptation to spread more easily by droplets or through the air. Person to person transmission, especially by respiratory droplet transmission (such as through coughs and sneezes) is a necessary precondition for the virus to become capable of causing a pandemic.

These findings support the conclusions drawn from China's investigations of human H7N9 cases so far. China has found no clear evidence of sustained human-to-human spread of the H7N9 virus. Human cases of H7N9 virus infection in China reported have been primarily associated with exposure to infected poultry. Currently no human cases of H7N9 virus infection have been reported in the United States.

The paper describes the results of multiple studies conducted on 2 H7N9 viruses obtained from fatal human H7N9 cases from China. The studies were conducted in ferrets, mice and human epithelial cells. Ferrets are considered the best small mammal for studying flu virus infection and are commonly used as a tool for the risk assessment of emerging flu viruses that may pose a risk to public health.

The ferret studies revealed that the H7N9 viruses spread readily among ferrets placed in the same cage. However, the viruses were less capable of respiratory droplet transmission, which the researchers tested by placing infected ferrets in cages adjacent to cages housing naive [uninfected] ferrets. Compared to a human seasonal flu virus from last season, the H7N9 viruses were considerably less capable of transmission by the respiratory route.

Other study findings indicated that the H7N9 virus did not cause severe disease in the ferrets and did not spread systemically to the spleen, kidney, liver, or intestinal tract. The lack of systemic spread by H7N9 is different from H5N1 (another avian influenza virus that can cause severe disease in humans). Systemic spread is considered an indicator of severe disease.

In addition to ferrets, CDC researchers also studied the H7N9 virus in mice. Compared with ferrets, the virus caused more lethal illness in the mice, and the virus was more capable of replicating in the lungs of mice compared with other avian and human seasonal viruses tested in the study. Also notable, the H7N9 virus was able to easily infect mice, whereas human seasonal flu viruses typically require prior host adaptation to be able to efficiently infect mice.

The mouse studies also revealed that H7N9 virus can pass through the eyes to infect the respiratory tract. As a result, the eyes represent a possible portal of entry for the H7N9 virus. This finding supports CDC's existing flu recommendations to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth to help prevent spread of germs. It also supports the recommendation for health care providers to wear eye protection when caring for patients with confirmed or suspected H7N9 infection.

The remaining study findings analyzed the H7N9 virus's ability to replicate in cells derived from human epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are found in the human respiratory tract and are the primary site where flu viruses replicate in humans. CDC researchers found that the H7N9 virus demonstrated a 20- to 400-fold increase in replication at the 2-day mark when compared with a human seasonal flu virus and 2 other avian flu viruses genetically related to the H7N9 virus. Compared with a human seasonal H3N2 virus, the H7N9 virus exhibited an 80 000-fold increase in replication at 24 hours.

The studies in mice and ferrets corroborated this finding, as considerably more H7N9 virus was produced and detected in the respiratory tracts of ferrets and mice compared with the amount of virus produced by seasonal flu virus infection. This suggests the H7N9 viruses have the capacity to reproduce quickly and produce a large amount of virus within the cells of mammals and human airway cells. However, the viruses' ability to replicate was determined to be better suited to the higher temperatures found in the lower airways (lungs) versus the lower temperatures found in the upper airways of mammals.

The study, entitled "Pathogenesis and transmission of A (H7N9) avian influenza virus in ferrets and mice", is available for online viewing via Nature's website.

Characterization of H7N9 influenza A viruses isolated from humans
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza A viruses rarely infect humans; however, when human infection and subsequent human-to-human transmission occurs, worldwide outbreaks (pandemics) can result. The recent sporadic infections of humans in China with a previously unrecognized avian influenza A virus of the H7N9 subtype (A(H7N9)) have caused concern owing to the appreciable case fatality rate associated with these infections (more than 25 percent), potential instances of human-to-human transmission, and the lack of pre-existing immunity among humans to viruses of this subtype. Here we characterize 2 early human A(H7N9) isolates, A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9); hereafter referred to as Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1, respectively. In mice, Anhui/1 and Shanghai/1 were more pathogenic than a control avian H7N9 virus (A/duck/Gunma/466/2011 (H7N9); Dk/GM466) and a representative pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus (A/California/4/2009 (H1N1pdm09); CA04). Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated well in the nasal turbinate [bones] of ferrets. In nonhuman primates, Anhui/1 and Dk/GM466 replicated efficiently in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, whereas the replicative ability of conventional human influenza viruses is typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract of infected primates. In contrast, Anhui/1 did not replicate well in miniature pigs after intranasal inoculation. Critically, Anhui/1 transmitted through respiratory droplets in one of 3 pairs of ferrets. Glycan arrays showed that Anhui/1, Shanghai/1 and A/Hangzhou/1/2013 (H7N9) (a 3rd human A(H7N9) virus tested in this assay) bind to human virus-type receptors, a property that may be critical for virus transmissibility in ferrets. Anhui/1 was found to be less sensitive in mice to neuraminidase inhibitors than a pandemic H1N1 2009 virus, although both viruses were equally susceptible to an experimental antiviral polymerase inhibitor. The robust replicative ability in mice, ferrets and nonhuman primates and the limited transmissibility in ferrets of Anhui/1 suggest that A(H7N9) viruses have pandemic potential.

The H7N9 avian influenza virus, as the name suggests, is common among avian creatures but is also known to have infected humans. The virus was described by Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general for health, security and the environment of the World Health Organization as "an unusually dangerous virus for humans." Now scientists fear possible pandemic influenza in Japan because of its people's lack of immunity from the virus.

A group of researchers from the University of Tokyo through the Institute of Medical Science made a study of the strain. Blood samples taken from 500 subjects from 2010 until 2012 were found to have no H7N9 antibodies. "Only a limited number of people fell seriously ill during the worldwide outbreak of the H1N1 virus in 2009 because adults were immune to a certain level of that strain of influenza virus," research leader Yoshihiro Kawaoka said. The virology professor at the university also admitted, "Nobody is immune to H7N9, which means it could have serious ramifications in humans."

The virus originated from China and has also reached the island of Taiwan, where many tourists visiting Japan come from. Japan was also warned of H7N9-infected chickens that may have been served in the country's fast food industry. [Influenza viruses in general are not transmitted by food-borne routes. - Mod.CP] "Infections to humans could occur again in autumn or later, so there is a need to watch the situation carefully," Kawaoka reminded. The team of Kawaoka published their findings in the British journal Nature on Thursday [11 Jul 2013]. A lab test on mice was also performed to identify which drug is effective against the virus. One of the drugs used has not yet been approved for human administration, but has yielded better results. [See preceding report. - Mod.CP]

[Perhaps the most significant and concerning observations are those concerning the effect of the H7N9 virus in mice. Compared with ferrets (usually considered to be the most sensitive model), the H7N9 virus caused more lethal illness in the mice, and the virus was more capable of replicating in the lungs of mice compared with other avian and human seasonal influenza viruses tested in the study. Also notably, the H7N9 virus was able to easily infect mice, whereas human seasonal flu viruses typically require prior host adaptation to be able to efficiently infect mice.

No trace of H7N9 virus infection was found in seroprevalence studies in Japan, confirming that human H7N9 infections have so far been confined to China. - Mod.CP]
