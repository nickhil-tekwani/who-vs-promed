[1] Hong Kong: confirmed 2nd infection
Date: Mon 24 Aug 2020
Source: MedPage Today [edited]
https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/covid19/88234


A 33 year old man in Hong Kong may represent the 1st confirmed case of reinfection, researchers in Hong Kong said. The man was diagnosed with COVID-19 on [26 Mar 2020], hospitalized, then recovered. He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 again on [15 Aug 2020], and whole genome sequencing of viral isolates from the 2 episodes indicated they were from different clades, reported Kwok-Yung Yuen, of the University of Hong Kong, and colleagues in a manuscript they said had been accepted for publication in Clinical Infectious Diseases, but not yet published.

That is almost unassailable evidence that the man was infected a 2nd time, and another indication, albeit far from definitive, that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may not last very long. Interestingly, the patient was asymptomatic during his 2nd infection, the authors said.

Reinfection was suspected in a few previous cases of COVID-19 but never documented. Many experts believed what appeared to be reinfection was simply a prolonged infection. But these researchers could not be more clear: "We report the 1st case of reinfection of COVID-19," they wrote. "Epidemiological, clinical, serological, and genomic analyses confirmed that the patient had reinfection instead of persistent viral shedding from 1st infection."

Indeed, whole genome sequencing found the 1st viral genome was most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 strains from the US or England collected in March/April [2020] strain, and the 2nd viral genome was most closely related to strains from Switzerland and England in July/August [2020]. There were 24 nucleotide differences suggesting different strains.

Other evidence the authors offered that the patient had an acute infection in August [2020] was his elevated C-reactive protein level and "relatively high viral load with gradual decline". They also pointed to the long period -- 142 days -- between infections, saying prior research found viral RNA is undetectable one month after symptom onset, and prolonged viral shedding has only ever been documented up to 104 days after infection.

"My hope is that while reinfection has been documented, it is a rare or uncommon occurrence," Peter Hotez, of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not involved in the research, told MedPage Today. "So far that seems to be the case, but we're still only a few months into this pandemic."

Matthew Spinelli, of the University of California San Francisco, said this was an important study, but unsurprising since people are often reinfected with seasonal coronaviruses responsible for common colds. "We saw what we would've expected to see," Spinelli, who was not involved with the research, told MedPage Today. "It's good he had no symptoms the 2nd time. ... It shows some degree of immunity, but not enough to prevent asymptomatic infection."

Yuen and colleagues reported that the man experienced fever and a deep, productive cough during the March [2020] episode, at which point he tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. He was discharged on [14 Apr 2020] after 2 negative SARS-CoV-2 tests, taken a day apart.

But in August [2020], the man was returning to Hong Kong from Spain via the United Kingdom and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 upon reentry screening at the Hong Kong airport. He was hospitalized but remained asymptomatic and afebrile. The only lab abnormalities were hypokalemia and the slightly elevated CRP, which declined during hospitalization. The patient's SARS-CoV-2 load fell during hospitalization, based on serial PCR testing.

Ten days after the 1st onset and a day after the 2nd onset, the patient tested negative for IgG against SARS-CoV-2. Only serum specimens collected on day 5 after the 2nd hospitalization tested positive for IgG.

"Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in the global human population as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection," said a press release emailed from HKUMed [Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine]. When asked about implications for COVID-19 vaccine development, Spinelli noted that no vaccine to a respiratory virus like this is expected to be 100% effective -- much like the flu shot, which reduces infection incidence and illness severity but only to a degree. "The fact that the 2nd infection had much reduced severity is what we'd expect to see with a vaccine. Hopefully, a vaccine will induce more rigorous immunity," he said.

Limitations to the data include there was only one archived serum specimen available for serology testing, and a negative antibody test does not exclude the possibility the patient developed antibodies during the early phase of the 1st episode, since patients may not mount an antibody response for 10 days.

[The article is not available on a pre-print server to evaluate the findings, starting with the immunologic status of the individual. Perhaps this will serve as a nidus for further studies to try to identify the significance of this finding. What is the order of magnitude of 2nd infections? Are they common? What is the duration of immunity following 1st infection? Is the observed 4 months in this case the norm or an outlier? What is the duration of viral shedding after 2nd infection, and duration of antibody following 1st infection?

Curiously, this is the 1st documented 2nd infection, after almost 24 million confirmed cases (and probably 10 times more actual infections, based on serologic studies in multiple countries). Was it just serendipity that led to the screening of an asymptomatic infected traveler returning to Hong Kong? But, there have been many tourists and business people returning to Hong Kong, mainland China, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand where airport screening is the rule rather than the exception... - Mod.MPP]

[2] Plasma therapy
[A] WHO caution
Date: Mon 24 Aug 2020
Source: The New York Times, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/08/24/health/ap-eu-med-virus-outbreak-plasma-treatment.html?ocid=uxbndlbing


The World Health Organization on Monday [24 Aug 2020] cautioned that using blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors to treat other patients is still considered an experimental therapy, voicing the concern as a US boost for the treatment has many scientists afraid formal studies will be derailed.

On Sunday [23 Aug 2020], the US Food and Drug Administration authorized what's called "emergency use" of the treatment under its special powers to speed the availability of promising experimental drugs during a public health crisis. The action isn't the same as approving plasma as safe and effective, and numerous rigorous studies are underway to find out if it really works. So far, "The results are not conclusive," WHO's chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan said during a press briefing. "At the moment, it's still very low-quality evidence."

Convalescent plasma is a century-old treatment that was used to fight off flu and measles outbreaks in the days before vaccines and was tried more recently during the Ebola outbreak. When the body encounters a new germ, it makes proteins called antibodies that are specially targeted to fight the infection. The antibodies float in plasma -- the yellowish, liquid part of blood -- which is collected from COVID-19 survivors and given to patients infected with coronavirus.

Swaminathan said WHO considered plasma therapy to be experimental and that it should continue to be evaluated. She said the treatment is difficult to standardize: Plasma must be collected individually, and people produce different levels of antibodies. "Of course, countries can do an emergency listing if they feel the benefits outweigh the risks," she said. "But that's usually done when you're waiting for the more definitive evidence."

In a letter describing the FDA's emergency action, the agency's chief scientist said the treatment "should not be considered a new standard of care" for coronavirus infections, and that more data from studies will be available in the coming months. But already, so many COVID-19 patients have requested plasma rather than agreeing to be part of a research study that many scientists fear they won't get a clear answer on whether the treatment really works -- and if it does, how and when it should be used for the best outcomes.

Martin Landray, of the University of Oxford, said that while the therapy offers "huge promise", there was still no proof it works. "There is a huge gap between theory and proven benefit," he said in a statement. If just a few thousand patients took part in the research "we would have the answer," said Landray, who is conducting a plasma study in the UK. "If effective, convalescent plasma could be rapidly used worldwide. If not, it could be abandoned," Stephen Griffin, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Leeds, said there was still considerable uncertainty about the immune system's response to COVID-19, making any potential use of convalescent plasma challenging.

"It appears that the lessons from hydroxychloroquine have not been learned," Griffin said, referring to the malaria drug touted as a potential treatment for the coronavirus. The FDA also granted hydroxychloroquine an emergency authorization before suspending it months later after several trials showed the drug didn't work against COVID-19 and raised the risk of heart, kidney, liver, and other problems.

[B] Justification of FDA emergency authorization
Date: Mon 24 Aug 2020

https://www.globalhealthnow.org/2020-08/fda-reverses-course-plasma-treatment


The Infectious Diseases Society of America noted "some positive signals" that [convalescent plasma] can help COVID-19 patients but results from randomized controlled trials are needed to prove its efficacy. However, Arturo Casadevall, who launched the convalescent plasma approach in the US, supported the decision to move ahead.

The health equity angle in FDA's decision
-----------------------------------------
Arturo Casadevall, chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the FDA decision resolves "a major health equity issue". Casadevall, who proposed the treatment strategy in a [27 Feb 2020] Wall Street Journal op-ed, shared 4 key points with GHN this morning:

"Plasma was already freely available provided that physicians registered with the FDA under the prior mechanism known as the extended access protocol. [But] it was hard for understaffed hospitals, especially those caring for underserved populations, to get all the paperwork done. Patients had to wait longer for someone to get the registration done, which directly impacted care given the data that plasma reduces mortality if given before day 3 of hospitalization. The health equity is critical here -- the EUA [emergency use authorization] levels the playing field and makes it easier for poor people to get the same treatment that was available to the better off. Randomized clinical trials continue, and they will provide definitive data in the future."

[C] Questions and answers re use of convalescent plasma
Date: Sun 23 Aug 2020
Source: STAT [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/23/is-convalescent-plasma-safe-and-effective


The Food and Drug Administration on Sunday[23 Aug 2020] issued an emergency authorization for doctors to treat COVID-19 using blood plasma from patients who've recovered from the disease. Below, STAT answers the major questions surrounding convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment and the science supporting its use.

- What is convalescent plasma, and how does it work?
When people get sick with COVID-19, their immune systems generate antibodies to fight the disease. Those antibody proteins float in their blood plasma -- the liquid component of blood that suspends blood cells. Doctors can harvest the plasma, test it for safety, and then purify it to isolate those antibodies. That "plasma-derived therapy", or "convalescent plasma", can be injected into another patient sick with COVID-19, and the antibodies it contains can help fight the virus early in an infection until the patient's immune system generates its own antibodies in sufficient quantities to beat back COVID-19.

- Does scientific evidence show that convalescent plasma is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19?
The Mayo Clinic released data in June [2020] [https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-finds-convalescent-plasma-safe-for-diverse-patients-with-covid-19/] that showed plasma treatment was safe following transfusion in a group of 20 000 patients, which included substantial enrollment from Black and Latino patients.

A study released [13 Aug 2020 -- the Mayo clinic study above https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/13/large-study-suggests-convalescent-plasma-can-help-treat-covid-19-with-caveats/)] -- but not yet peer-reviewed -- suggested that using convalescent plasma to treat patients with severe COVID-19 soon after their diagnosis was associated with a lower likelihood of death. But the study had serious scientific limitations that make interpreting the findings difficult. The Mayo Clinic study, which enrolled more than 35 000 patients, showed that patients who received transfusions within 3 days of their COVID-19 diagnosis had a 7-day death rate of 8.7%, while patients who received plasma treatment after 4 or more days had a mortality rate of 11.9%. The difference met the standard for statistical significance.

The study didn't include a placebo group for comparison, however, so it's unclear exactly how impactful the plasma treatment might be. The study was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and sought to broaden access to convalescent plasma, part of a so-called "expanded access" program not designed to definitively test how well the treatment works, but instead to quickly get it to patients. More rigorous randomized, placebo-controlled studies of convalescent plasma are ongoing.

- What does an emergency use authorization, or "EUA", mean?
The FDA has issued a number of emergency authorizations for COVID-19 treatments: Most notably the Gilead Sciences antiviral remdesivir, and for the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which the agency has since withdrawn. The authorizations mean, effectively, that the agency believes the treatments in question are promising and largely safe, though there's not yet definitive data supporting their efficacy. An EUA for convalescent plasma would effectively license doctors across the country to begin treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma, but it's unclear whether it will result in a meaningful expansion in access to the therapy, in part because the supply is limited by the number of recovered patients who donate plasma.

The Mayo Clinic study, which relied on an FDA "expanded access" program, was broad enough that it allowed 35 000 patients access to the treatment despite the lack of a formal authorization for its use. It's unclear whether an EUA will lead to a major increase in the number of doctors capable of using convalescent plasma to treat COVID-19 and the number of patients who will end up receiving the treatment.

- Has there been pushback regarding use of convalescent plasma?
Yes. The New York Times reported on Wednesday [19 Aug 2020] that [Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases] and [Francis Collins], director of the National Institutes of Health recently intervened to discourage the FDA from issuing an EUA for convalescent plasma, citing concerns over weak data. It is not clear whether their reported pushback made a difference. [Collins and Fauci] are widely respected scientists but have no authority over the FDA. Scientists outside government have cast the convalescent plasma debate as a case study in pandemic-era science -- and how the urgency of treating COVID-19 balances against the need for caution and due diligence in developing new medical treatments.

[The concern over safety and efficacy of a therapeutic or a vaccine during an outbreak of an infectious disease has come up before, for example, during the Ebola outbreak, as well as earlier during the HIV epidemic. The EUA has been used in such situations for test protocols, treatments, and vaccines. Evaluations of efficacy and safety require controlled studies with matched patients receiving a placebo or the test compound, in this case, convalescent plasma. These clinical studies take time and patience, but there is political and community pressure to find treatments to control COVID-19 immediately with little appetite for waiting, making it very difficult to proceed with caution. - Mod.LK]

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[4] WHO updates
[A] Weekly summary
Date: Mon 24 Aug 2020
Source: WHO [abridged, edited]

The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 23 Aug 2020.

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
Over 1.7 million new COVID-19 cases and 39 000 new deaths were reported to WHO for the week ending [23 Aug 2020], a 4% decrease in the number of cases and 5% increase in the number of deaths compared to the previous week ([10 to 16 Aug 2020]) (Figure 1: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by WHO region, [30 Dec to 23 Aug 2020]). A cumulative total of over 23 million cases and 800 000 deaths have been reported so far.

With the exception of the South East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, a decrease in the weekly case incidence was reported across WHO regions in the last 7 days (Table 1, Figure 2). Although the WHO Region of the Americas remains the most affected, accounting for 50% of newly reported cases and 62% of deaths, the region had the largest decrease compared to the previous week. The South East Asia Region, which is the 2nd most active region, continues to report an increase, accounting for 28% and 15% of newly reported cases and deaths respectively. In the European Region, the number of cases reported has consistently increased over the last 3 weeks, however, only a slight decrease (1%) was reported in the most recent week, and the number of deaths has continued to decrease across the region. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, the number of reported cases increased by 4% compared to the previous week, however, the number of reported deaths have consistently decreased over the last 6 weeks. Likewise, the African and Western Pacific regions reported overall decreases in case activity over the past week.

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
The number of cases and deaths reported in the African Region decreased by 8% and 11% respectively in the past 7 days, primarily due to a decrease in cases reported in Algeria, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal, and South Africa (Figure 3, Table 2). Despite the overall decrease in the number of cases across the region, Uganda reported an increase of over 300%. Here, intensive community transmission has been reported in capital Kampala, particularly the divisions of Makindye, Nakawa, and Kawempe. Ethiopia has continued to report an increase in cases and deaths; and similarly, Namibia and Nigeria reported a 55% and 19% increase in the number of cases respectively. After 22 days of no cases, Mauritius reported 2 new cases in returnees who were repatriated from a neighbouring country.

- Region of the Americas
The number of cases and deaths decreased by 11% and 17% respectively compared to the previous week - primarily driven by reduced transmission rates reported from the United States of America, Brazil, Dominican Republic, and Panama (Figure 4, Table 3). Several countries and territories in the Caribbean islands have, however, reported a large increase in cases and deaths in the last seven days including Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, and Guyana. The increase in cases observed in the Caribbean islands may in part be due to an increase in tourism. The number of deaths reported in Peru decreased by 73% compared to the previous week, however, the incidence death rate in the last seven days (42 deaths per 1 million population) and the cumulative death rate in the country (826 deaths per 1 million population) remains the highest in the region.

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The number of cases reported in the Eastern Mediterranean Region increased by 2% in the last 7 days, however, the number of deaths decreased by 5% and has consistently decreased over the last 6 weeks (Figure 5). Lebanon, Tunisia, and Jordan reported the highest increase in cases compared to the previous week (Table 4). Following the explosion in Beirut, Lebanon on [4 Aug 2020], healthcare capacity in the area has diminished while COVID-19 cases continue to rise. As a result of the increase in cases, the Ministry of Public Health has established testing sites for residents and volunteers in the areas most affected by the blast. In addition, several health facilities are being restored and health supplies, including personal protective equipment, have been received.

- European Region
Following a steady increase in the number of cases reported in the European Region over the last few weeks, the number of cases decreased slightly by 1% in the last 7 days. The number of deaths reported in the last 7 days decreased by 12%, continuing the downward trend (Figure 6). Not all countries are reporting a decline: Spain reported a 200% increase in the number of deaths in the last week [week of 17 Aug 2020] compared to the previous week. As countries across the region continue to report a resurgence in cases, several countries reported record high numbers in the last 7 days including Croatia, Poland, Ukraine, Czechia, and Moldova (Table 5). In response to the increase in cases across the region, many countries have recently re-introduced public health and social measures including travel restrictions.

- South East Asia Region
South East Asia is the 2nd most affected region and currently accounts for 28% and 15% of newly reported cases and deaths respectively, globally in the past 7 days. The region has seen a steady increase in reported cases and deaths, with a 4% increase in the past 7 days (Figure 7). India continues to report the majority of cases and has reported a cumulative total of over 3 million cases, which accounts for 86% of all regional confirmed cases (Table 6). The number of cases and deaths in Nepal has rapidly increased in the last 7 days with a 49% and 52% increase respectively compared to the previous weeks. In addition, the testing capacity in Nepal has significantly increased resulting in a 38% increase in the testing rate.

- Western Pacific Region
The number of cases reported in the Western Pacific Region decreased by 5% following a decrease in the number of new cases reported by Japan, Australia, Singapore, China, and Viet Nam (Figure 8, Table 7). The Republic of Korea reported a 180% increase in cases, mainly due to an increase in cases associated with religious gatherings. Due to the increase in cases reported in the region, some Pacific Island countries are tightening border measures. There is also an increase in active testing and case finding systems across the region, which are facilitating the detection and control of clusters.

- The South East Asia region reported 26.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 19.9% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.6 million cases.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 24 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (59 696), followed by the USA (41 484), and Brazil (21 434) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.4%). There were 4463 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (23-24 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, Peru, Russia, Philippines, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3644 to 59 696. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Mexico, Bangladesh, Iran, France, Chile, Indonesia, Israel, Ukraine, South Africa, and Germany, and their range of reported new cases is 1628 to 3541. A total of 23 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is very little change in the average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 1.6%), while daily reported deaths have increased by 3.4%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions -- the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
