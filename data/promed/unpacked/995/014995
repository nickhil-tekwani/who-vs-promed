More than 500 cases of schistosomiasis have been recorded in Rakhine and Inn Lay area [Inle, Shan State]. Treatment activities are being initiated in the affected areas, according to Dr. Than Tun Aung, Deputy Director General (Natural Disaster) from the Department of Public Health.

Freshwater snails are the vector of schistosomiasis that infects humans and domestic animals. However, infected persons cannot transmit the infection to others.

Dr. Than Tun Aung states, "In Rakhine, the number of cases are highest in Pawktaw Town. [A total of] 8 townships are affected, including Ponnagyun and Sittwe. There are [a total of] 302 cases. Some cases [have also been reported] in Shwekyin of Bago Region. About 200 cases were also [reported] in Inn Lay area. All affected cases are now [being] treated with antihelminthics." These drugs are rare, and supplies have been requested from the World Health Organization (WHO).

Dr. Than Tun Aung also said, "Most of the affected cases are under 15 years old. It may take many years to eliminate the infection. The disease burden is needed to be assessed, too. The experts from WHO and China will assist in studying the infection. About 200 000 people die from the infection around the world annually. It is a rare disease."

[The 1st cases of schistosomiasis in the country were discovered in March 2018, with about 59 cases in Sittwe Town of Rakhine State. The infection was reported after testing of suspected cases by chance. Hence, existence and magnitude of the infection in the country remain unclear.

A study of antibodies against _Schistosoma_ spp. in southern Myanmar, around the Inlay Lake, Nyaung Shwe Township, Southern Shan State, Myanmar, found that the overall seroprevalence (IgG) was 23.8% (95% CI: 18.8-28.8%) (Soe HZ et al. Detection of _Schistosoma_ antibodies and exploration of associated factors among local residents around Inlay Lake, Southern Shan State, Myanmar. Infect Dis Poverty 2017;6:3). The study concluded that "_Schistosoma_ infection was most probably present at some time in this location of Myanmar." - Mod.EP
