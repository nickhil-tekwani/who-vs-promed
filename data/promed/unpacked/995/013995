At least 10 elephants living in U.S. zoos have died after being infected
with a previously unknown form of the herpes virus, according to a study
published Friday in the journal Science.
Scientists at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and at the National Zoo in
Washington report that they have isolated and identified a lethal virus that
apparently can jump from African elephants to Asian elephants.
"This is very troubling because these are endangered species and also
because there may still be carrier African elephants in the zoos," Johns
Hopkins researcher and study co-author Gary Hayward said.
The study found that seven of the of 34 elephants born in U.S. and Canadian
zoos between 1983 and 1996 died from the virus. Study of stored tissue shows
that three animals earlier died of the virus, and two others may have died
of the disease, the researchers report. All but two of the dead animals were
Asian elephants.
Although they closely resemble each other, Asian and African elephants are
distinctly different. The Asian elephant is the one most frequently bred in
captivity and used as a working animal. Researchers said it appears that the
Asian elephants were infected when they came in contact with African
elephants in zoos.
The researchers said the herpes virus attacks the blood vessels of the
heart, liver and other organs in the elephants and can cause death withIN
only a few days. Laboratory studies uncovered the herpes virus, which had
not been previously identified. The researchers then tested blood and tissue
samples from healthy African elephants living in the wild and found that
they had a herpes virus that was identical to the virus that killed the zoo
animals. The virus usually is not deadly for the African elephants.
One elephant in Florida was cured of the infection when it was treated with
famciclovir, an anti-viral drug developed to treat herpes in humans. The
elephant herpes is similar to a virus that causes cold sores and painful
genital sores in humans.
