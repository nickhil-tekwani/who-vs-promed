Ministry of animal resources and fisheries, E-E-S [Eastern Equatoria State] to supply veterinary drugs in the 8 counties
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold chain equipment will also be provided to protect these drugs.

The state's Minister for Animal Resources and Fisheries, Martin Lorika Lojam said the ministry understands the importance of ensuring a reliable and stable supply of veterinary drugs and equipment to safeguard livestock production in the state. In September this year [2014], the ministry announced the purchase of veterinary drugs, which will be distributed to the livestock keepers in the state.

Livestock, particularly cattle, goats, and sheep, are an important social and economic asset in South Sudan. However, endemic diseases like anthrax [are] undermining livestock production. An estimated one in 5 cattle die from disease according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

This is the 1st time that the Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries in Eastern Equatoria State [EES] is receiving a huge supply of veterinary drugs, according to Minister Lorika. He said that that the drugs will be distributed to the 8 Counties but much consideration will be given to counties with higher numbers of livestock.

Among the drugs purchased are Albafas, ButaleX, Parvexon, healing oil, Tylosin, Norodine, Levacide injection, and Ethidium bromide tabs.

A number of veterinary kits like gum boots have equally been supplied to the Ministry's Headquarters, awaiting distribution to all the counties in the state. The Animal Ministry Director General Donato said that the veterinary drugs were purchased from Nairobi, Kenya.

[This may not sound like much, but for a country like South Sudan, riven by war and unrest, this is a great step forward. If they are making cold chain equipment available to the rural veterinary services it implies that the "huge" purchases go beyond merely antibiotics and drugs but include vaccines; anthrax need is mentioned. If any member is aware of more detailed information, please share. Livestock disease reporting out of South Sudan is spotty, at best.

Maps of South Sudan can be seen at https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/SouthSudan/map_2684.pdf and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3064649,24650. Checking the maps indicates that the drug distribution may be limited to East Equatoria state, which is on the northern Kenyan border, thus explaining Kenya's possible involvement. The news report hints that the drug distribution might be limited to this Southern Sudan province. - Mod.MHJ]
