Notice to travellers: updated 20 Jun, 2005 (and 14 Apr 2005; released 16
Mar 2005)
---------------------------------------------------
According to a 15 Jun 2005 World Health Organization (WHO) report, the
Ministry of Health of Viet Nam has confirmed 4 new human cases of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection. All 4 patients are alive. 2 are from
the northern city of Hanoi, the 3rd from the nearby province of Hai Duong,
and the 4th from the central province of Nghe An.
These are the latest in a series of sporadic human cases of H5N1 human
infection reported in Viet Nam since December 2004. Also since December
2004, there have been 4 cases reported from Cambodia. As of 17 Jun 2005,
there have been 107 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) reported in
Viet Nam (86), Thailand (17), and Cambodia (4), resulting in 54 deaths [and
one in Indonesia - Mod.CP]. For more information about H5N1 infections in
humans and the cumulative number of cases, visit the WHO website:
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/>.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are in communication
with WHO and continue to closely monitor the H5N1 situation in Asia. CDC
has not recommended that the general public avoid travel to any of the
countries affected by H5N1. Most cases of H5N1 infection in humans are
thought to have occurred from direct contact with infected poultry.
Therefore, care should be taken to avoid contact, when feasible, with live,
well-appearing, sick, or dead poultry and any surfaces that may have been
contaminated by poultry, or their feces or secretions. Transmission of H5N1
viruses to 2 people through consumption of uncooked duck blood may also
have occurred in Vietnam in 2005. Therefore, consumption of uncooked
poultry or poultry products, including blood, should be avoided. It is
thought that a few cases of person to person spread of H5N1 viruses have
occurred. For example, one instance of probable person to person
transmission associated with close contact between an ill child and her
mother is thought to have occurred in Thailand in September 2004. More
recently, possible person to person transmission of H5N1 viruses is being
investigated in several clusters of human cases in Vietnam. So far, spread
of H5N1 virus from one ill person to another has been very rare and
transmission has not continued any further beyond one person.
H5N1 infections in humans can cause serious disease and death. An
inactivated vaccine to protect humans against influenza A (H5N1) is
undergoing human clinical trials in the United States, but no human H5N1
vaccine is currently available. The H5N1 viruses currently infecting birds
and some humans in Asia are resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, 2
antiviral medications commonly used for influenza. The H5N1 viruses are
susceptible to the antiviral medications oseltamavir and zanamavir,
although the effectiveness of these drugs when used for treatment of H5N1
virus infection is unknown. For more information about influenza antiviral
drugs, see <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/outbreaks/asia.htm>.
Outbreaks of H5N1 among poultry have been confirmed in Cambodia, China,
Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam during 2005, and in Malaysia and Laos
during 2004. To reduce the risk of infection, Americans [and others]
visiting areas where outbreaks of H5N1 among poultry or human H5N1 cases
have been reported should observe the following measures to help avoid
illness: Before any international travel Always educate yourself and others
who may be traveling with you about any disease risks in areas you plan to
visit (for information about H5N1, see this website for information:
<http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm>).
Be sure you are up to date with all your inoculations, and see your doctor
or health care provider, ideally 4 to 6 weeks before travel to get any
additional shots, medications, or information you may need. CDC's health
recommendations for international travel to Southeast Asia are provided on
CDC's travelers' health website at <http://www.cdc.gov/travel/seasia.htm>.
Assemble a travel health kit containing basic first aid and medical
supplies. Be sure to include a thermometer and alcohol-based hand rub for
hand hygiene. See this webpage for other suggested items:
<http://www.cdc.gov/travel/other/travelers-health-kit.htm>.
Identify in-country health care resources in advance of your trip.
Check your health insurance plan or get additional insurance that covers
medical evacuation in case you become sick. Information about medical
evacuation services is provided on the US Department of State website:
<http://www.travel.state.gov/medical.html>.
During travel: Avoid all direct contact with poultry, including touching
well-appearing, sick, or dead chickens and ducks. Avoid places such as
poultry farms and bird markets where live poultry are raised or kept, and
avoid handling surfaces contaminated with poultry feces or excretions.
As with other infectious illnesses, one of the most important preventive
practices is careful and frequent handwashing. Cleaning your hands often,
using soap and water (or waterless alcohol-based hand rubs when soap is not
available and hands are not visibly soiled), removes potentially infectious
material from your skin and helps prevent disease transmission.
Influenza viruses are destroyed by heat; therefore, as a precaution, all
foods from poultry, including eggs and poultry blood, should be thoroughly
cooked.
After your return: monitor your health for 10 days. If you become ill with
fever, difficulty breathing, cough, or any illness during this period,
consult a health care provider. Before you visit a health care setting,
tell the provider about your symptoms, whether you have had direct poultry
contact, and where you traveled. This way he or she can be aware you have
traveled to an area reporting avian influenza.
For more information about H5N1 infections in humans, visit the WHO website
and the CDC Avian Influenza site: <http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/index.htm>.
