99/116 Survey on _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ in Germany
(1998 harvest) [edited
The EPPO Reporting Service 99/054 presented results of the surveys on
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. sepedonicus carried out in Germany for
the 1997 potato harvest and part of the 1998 harvest. The German NPPO
provided more information on the survey concerning the 1998 potato harvest
and also noted an error in that report. The sentence 'The number of
infested lots found in 1997 was twice as high as in 1996', should be
replaced by 'The amount of samples tested during that period was twice as
high as in 1996'.
Official tests (IF [immunofluorecence, in some laboratories IF and PCR)
were done for latent infections in seed and ware potatoes. In all German L
nder, all prebasic and basic material is tested. In the main seed potato
production areas, all certified material is tested (Bayern,
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Niedersachsen, Schleswig-Holstein), but in other
Lander 80-100% certified material is tested.
1998 harvest: 16 551 samples were tested (251 gene-collection and breeding
material, 11 109 seed potato production, 992 seed potato trade, 4199 ware
potatoes). In addition, visual inspections were also carried out.
Fifteen positive cases were found on seed potatoes and 38 on ware potatoes.
In comparison to the 1997 survey, there is a significant decrease concerning
seed potatoes and a slight improvement for ware potatoes. Phytosanitary
measures are being applied to eradicate the disease.

[It's good to see that PCR is being applied to detect the pathogen. Does
anyone have experience on the occurrence of false positives with this
assay? -Mod.DH
