Saudi sprays insecticide to fight fever
-----------------------------------------
Saudi planes are spraying insecticide on areas hit by an outbreak of Rift
Valley Fever that has killed over 80 people in Saudi Arabia and neighboring
Yemen.
Other countries in the region said they were on alert for signs of the
disease, which is spread from animals to humans by mosquitoes or
transmitted by contact with infected animals.
Saudi newspapers said the planes were spraying large areas of Jizan in the
south of the country as well as areas in Yemen near the Saudi border.
Saudi Arabia has said Rift Valley Fever has killed 16 people in the
kingdom. Newspapers reported that at least 60 people were under quarantine
in hospitals.
In Yemen, senior government officials have said the disease has killed at
least 65 people in recent days. The impoverished country has appealed for
international help to fight the outbreak and United Nations (news - web
sites) experts are expected to arrive soon.
Saudi Arabia and Yemen have not released figures for the number of
livestock killed by the fever.
Officials have urged people in infected areas to take precautions when
handling livestock. Saudi Arabia has banned the import of livestock from
eight, mostly African, countries.
Symptoms of the disease include high fever, diarrhea, burst arteries and
renal failure.
The Gulf Arab state of Oman said it was on alert for early signs of Rift
Valley fever, adding preventative measures were in place. Neighboring Qatar
and the United Arab Emirates said they were unaffected by the disease.

UAE declared free from Rift Valley Fever
---------------------------------------
The General Secretariat of Municipalities (GSM) yesterday held a meeting of
senior officials from the ministries of Health and Agriculture and Fisheries
and municipalities to discuss preventive measures against Rift Valley
fever, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, which claimed 16 lives in Jazan
[Jizan city in southern Saudi Arabia last week.
Dr Mahmoud Fikri, Assistant Under-Secretary for Preventive Medicine at the
Ministry of Health, who attended the Dubai meeting, issued a statement
saying that the UAE is completely free from Rift Valley fever.
Dr Fekri said that there were continuous contacts with Saudi health
authorities to follow up the situation there.
The virus is transmitted from livestock to humans through mosquitoes and
causes diarrhoea, nausea, and internal bleeding that can result in the
patient's death. The meeting was attended by, among others, Under-Secretary
of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries Rashid Mohammed Khalfan Al
Sharqi, General Secretary of GSM Jassim Mohammed bin Darwish and Assistant
General Secretary of GSM Obied bin Essa.
The participants discussed the various [routes of transmission of Rift
Valley fever and other diseases from animals to human beings. They also
discussed
the quarantine regulations and inspection measures with regard to the
import of livestock. They underscored the need for effective coordination
and cooperation among government organisations for taking preventive
measures. The meeting decided to direct the Ministry of Health to issue a
statement on Rift Valley Fever and the preventive measures being taken
against its spread in the UAE.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will issue a decision on
preventing the entry of imported animals with suspected diseases.
The municipalities will also take strict measures to check the meat
imported from various countries.

Ministry rules out Saudi meat ban
---------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health has said it would not ban imports of meat and
livestock from Saudi Arabia following the outbreak of the Rift Valley fever
which reportedly claimed some 30 people in Jizan region, south of the kingdom.
A ministry official said following contacts with Saudi health authorities
for further information about the viral disease, specialists from the
ministry examined the data and found out it was not possible for the fever
to spread in Qatar as the country lacked 2 key factors: mosquitoes and
round-the-year rain, essentially needed for the virus to grow.
Based on that, official concluded, there was no reason for precautionary
measures.
Meanwhile, reports from Dubai quoted UAE health officials as saying on
Monday precautionary measures would be taken to prevent the fever from
reaching the country.

Sudan fears big losses from Saudi livestock ban over disease
------------------------------------------------------------
Sudanese exporters feared Thursday they will suffer "big losses" from Saudi
Arabia's ban on livestock imports from African countries after 16 Saudis
died of Rift Valley Fever this month.
Government officials, who insisted that Sudan was free of the disease,
added here that Khartoum and Riyadh had made ministerial-level contacts
concerning the ban, newspapers reported.
Saudi officials announced Monday that they had decided to suspend imports
of livestock from Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen,
where they could be infected.
Sudan's Livestock Exporters Association was assessing the Saudi decision.
"This surprise decision by Saudi Arabia banning Sudanese livestock exports
will cause big losses to Sudanese exporters," Association Chairman Siddeiq
Haidub was Thursday quoted by independent Al Ayam daily as saying.
Hundreds of thousands of head of sheep and other livestock, including goats
and cattle, are exported annually to Saudi Arabia, Sudan's biggest market.
Haidub said exporters had asked their agents in the livestock production
areas in western Sudan, such as Kurdofan, to stop purchasing and sending
the livestock to Khartoum for export.
"There are now large numbers of head of livestock ready for shipment
abroad, a matter which will cost the exporters a great deal," Haidub said.
Meanwhile, Animal Resources Minister Abdallah Sidahmed told a cabinet
meeting on Wednesday that international organisations "did not indicate the
existence of this disease in the country," the official Al Anbaa daily said.
The cabinet's economic council, however, instructed the authorities to take
measures to ensure that Sudan is free of Rift Valley Fever and that the
country's livestock is not infected.
Saudi Arabia's health ministry said Sunday that the fever was first
reported September 11 in Jizan province, bordering Yemen, and that 16 of
the 36 people infected by it have died.
It was believed to have been introduced to Saudi Arabia via sheep, a large
number of which have recently died in Jizan, according to the health ministry.
It is the first time that the disease, which affects domestic animals and
can be transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, has been known to strike
outside Africa.
Symptoms include hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis and eye problems, although
human deaths from the disease are rare, according to experts.
Since Rift Valley Fever was first identified in 1930 after an epidemic
among sheep in Kenya, it has also affected Egypt, Madagascar, Mauritania
and Somalia, according to the World Health Organization.

[The first 3 reports are examples of vector control measures being
implemented along with heightened awareness of the disease and increased
surveillance in neighboring countries.
The last article is a good example of the economic impact of disease
outbreaks that can affect import and export markets, especially when the
food chain is involved. As has been illustrated in numerous ProMED-mail
postings, an initial reaction of many countries is to ban the movement of
potentially infected animals across borders. In this case, the livestock
industry of Sudan is being impacted purely by virtue of Sudan's
geographical location on the African continent, even though the disease has
not been officially reported from the Sudan (albeit it has been reported
from it's neighbors, Egypt to the north and Kenya to the South). This
major economic
impact of disease outbreaks should clearly demonstrate to countries the
importance of early identification and recognition of disease transmission
with rapid implementation of control measures. - Mod.MPP
[RVF is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in
Africa. Signs of the disease tend to be nonspecific, rendering it
difficult to recognize individual cases. During epidemics, the occurrence
of numerous abortions and deaths among young animal, together with an
influenza-like disease in man, tends to be characteristic.
The incubation period is 12-36 hours in lambs. A biphasic fever of up to
41C may develop, and affected animals are listless and not inclined to
move or feed and may show signs of abdominal pain. Lambs usually die
within 2 days. Older animals may die acutely or develop an inapparent
infection. Sick animals may regurgitate, develop icterus, and an unusually
bad-smelling diarrhea. Sometimes, abortion may be the only sign of
infection. In pregnant ewes, the mortality and abortion rates vary from 5
to almost 100 percent in different outbreaks and on different farms. The
rates in cattle are generally less than 10 percent.
Immunization remains the only effective way to protect livestock. Although
some times of immunization may cause abortion, pregnant ewes may be
considered for vaccination with a formalin inactivated form of virus.
People involved in the livestock industry should be made aware of the
potential dangers of exposure to RVF-infected animals and tissues. The
use of protective clothing and treatment with immune plasma and the
antiviral drug ribavirin should be considered when necessary. - Mod.TG
