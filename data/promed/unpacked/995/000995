In northern Tunisia, grapevines (_Vitis vinifera_) were found exhibiting
symptoms of grapevine yellows that included plant weakness, incomplete
lignification, flexible shoots and drooping. Affected leaves were thicker
than normal, brittle, rolled downward and showed veinal yellowing and
necrosis. In addition, grape bunches became dry and shrivelled before fruit
could fully develop and ripen. Given the symptoms observed, a phytoplasma
infection was suspected.

DNA was extracted using an enrichment procedure (Gundersen et al., 1996)
from 27 symptomatic grapevines and was analysed by PCR, using the universal
16S rRNA phytoplasma primer pair R16R2/F2 (Lee et al., 1993). The resulting
products were reamplified using the group-specific rRNA primer pair
R16(I)R1/F1 (Lee et al., 1994). 7 grapevine samples each yielded a nested
rDNA product of 1100 base pairs. No products were amplified using DNA
extracted from healthy grapevines. When the nested-PCR products were
digested with either HhaI, MseI or RsaI endonucleases, the restriction
profiles obtained were uniform indicating that infected grapevines all
contained very similar or co-identical phytoplasmas.

Likewise, profiles were also indistinguishable from those obtained after
HhaI, MseI or RsaI digestion of R16(1)R1/F1 products obtained from control
DNA extracts, made from European aster yellows phytoplasma-infected samples
and included for comparative purposes. Collectively, rDNA restriction
profiles delineated phytoplasmas infecting Tunisian grapevine as aster
yellows (16SrI-B) subgroup strains (Lee et al, 1998).

This is the first report of phytoplasmas in the aster yellows group
infecting grapevine in Tunisia.

[Aster yellows (AY) group (16SrI) phytoplasmas are associated worldwide
with more than 100 diseases, several of which are quarantine-regulated and
economically important. Scientists from the Molecular Plant Pathology
Laboratory at Beltsville, MD, USA found that combined use of 16S rRNA and
ribosomal protein gene sequences enabled differentiation of 18 distinct
subgroups in the AY group. A new species, 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteri',
was proposed to represent the AY phytoplasma group. This accomplishment
will aid plant quarantine agencies in implementing new regulations to
prevent these pathogens from being introduced into new regions.

Ing-Ming Lee, a USDA scientist specializing in mycoplasmas, and his
colleagues constructed the first comprehensive phytoplasma classification
system in 1993, based on RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA. Further work led to an
expanded system by 2000 that included 15 major phytoplasma groups and over
40 subgroups, providing the most comprehensive phytoplasma classification
system available.

The USDA maintains a list of regulated plant pests through its Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).
