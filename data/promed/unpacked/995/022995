[ProMED-mail apologizes for an unintentional delay in posting this
statement from Andreas Krueger, which concerns the detection of
chikungunya virus in Libreville, Gabon, and would like to thank
Andreas Krueger for sharing this finding with us.]
This outbreak almost coincides with recent entomological findings
(November 2006), which describe the 1st detection of the potential
chikungunya virus (CHIKV) vector _Aedes albopictus_ in Libreville
(together with _Ae. aegypti ssp. formosus_): Krueger A & Hagen RM:
First record of _Aedes albopictus_ in Gabon, Central Africa.
[Tropical Medicine & International Health, in press]. (Also to be
presented at the 5th European Congress on Tropical Medicine and
International Health, Amsterdam, 24-28 May 2007).
_Aedes albopictus_ has already been incriminated as the main vector
of CHIKV during epidemics in the Indian Ocean region since 2005 and
is also known as one of the world's most important invasive species.
