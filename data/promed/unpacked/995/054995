The Guipuzcoa province council has only detected animals affected by
serotype 1 bluetongue [virus], the mildest of the 24 variants of the
bluetongue virus [see comment]. Nevertheless, the [council] warned
yesterday [20 Oct 2008] that serotype 8, a more virulent serotype, is
presently circulating in the French Basque region and parts of
Aquitaine. In fact, epidemiology experts expect a strong circulation
of this virus in northern Spain this autumn [2008], according to
Rafael Uribarren, head of Rural Development for Guipuzcoa.

Uribarren appeared before the General Junta to explain the situation
with this disease in Guipuzcoa, which in the past year has killed
approximately 340 animals, the majority of them sheep. With the
existing data, Uribarren stressed the importance of vaccinating sheep
and goats as well as cattle.

Between November 2007 and last June [2008], the Province Council
facilitated the vaccination of the majority of the cattle population
against serotype 1 bluetongue virus. Now, in a few cases, they are
completing the vaccination, and, in others, they are giving booster
doses.

The vaccination of cattle against serotype 8 started last August
[2008] and will be completed by the middle of the next month
[November 2008]. By then, the entire cattle population (about 60 000
head) should have received a dose [of vaccine against serotype
BTV-8]. The vaccination of sheep and goats began in September [2008]
and will be completed by the end of this year or in early 2009. This
will affect approximately 160 000 head.

[There seems to be some ambiguity in the above article. Though at
present BTV-8 is indeed circulating in southwest France, bordering
Spain, an outbreak of BTV-8 in cattle in northern Spain (Cantabria)
was officially reported by Spain to the OIE in January 2008 (see
20080119.0233). 11 additional foci were reported during the following
months. Recently, the disease was reported from the south of Spain,
namely Andalusia, a remarkable leap. For the location of the 2008
northern and southern BTV-8 outbreaks in Spain as well as of the
BTV-1 outbreaks, see Spain's presentation of 15 Oct 2008 at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/bt_15102008_es.pdf>
(go to slide 6).
