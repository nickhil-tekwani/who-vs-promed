LEISHMANIASIS - NEPAL

>From de E-mail edition (April 8, 1997) of the Kathmandu Post (Nepal):
Kaalazar continues to spread in Sarlahi
SARLAHI, April 7 - Kalaazar, which has been spreading in Sarlahi district
since last year has not yet subsided. This disease, which was first detected
here in Pokhariya Tol of Bhaktipur VDC, has spread to different VDCs
including Khusipur, ward No 7 of Ishworpur VDC, Srinagar of Gaurishankar
VDC, Chitayan Tol of Haripur VDC, ward No 6 of Harion VDC, and Naukelba VDC
so far.
To date 25 people have died of this disease including 15 from Khusipur of
Ishwropur VDC, five from Pokhariya of Bhaktipur VDC and a few scattered
cases from other VDCs while they were undergoing treatment. In addition, a
large number of people have died without undergoing treatment.
Sarlahi Hospital and District Public Health Office had enquired as to why
the disease has not yet come under control over the last two years. During
the study, it was revealed that many people do not come to the health
facilities at all for the treatment of the disease once they fall ill. Even
if they opt for medical treatment, they visit quack doctors as a result of
which the disease is not diagnosed properly.
Hence many people die due to lack of proper treatment, chief of the District
Public Health Office Raj Kishor Singh told The Kathmandu Post. According to
Singh, many kinds of medicine are locally available for the treatment of
Kala-azar. There is also a costly injection, which should be administered in
the hospital in the care of the doctor. Patients do not like to be admitted
to the hospital for the injection which they take at home instead. There may
be reaction. This also poses a problem for treatment.
Sarlahi Hospital lacks the Bone Marrow equipment, which is essential for the
treatment of Kala-azar. Patients cannot go to Kathmandu for treatment due to
financial reasons. The chief of District Public Health Office said many
people go to a private lab at Sitamadhi, which, in his opinion, is not very
trustworthy.
This disease has been affecting different parts of Sarlahi district over the
last two years. Requests were made time and again for sending the spray but
the order for spray has just arrived a few days ago. But the spraying will
be started only after about 20 days after bringing 15 drums of spray from
Gol Bazaar. This quota of spray is meant for the area which was not sprayed
last year. But it will be quite insufficient because the disease is still
spreading in areas which were sprayed last year.
It has been felt that people's consciousness is lacking to the desired
extent because they are not coming forward for medical treatment. An active
role on the part of people's representatives has been deemed essential to
generate public awareness.
Local people complain that a large number of people have lost their lives due
to lack of active initiative of the concerned health worker, the concerned unit,
and medicine.
