Putting food out for birds creates "hot-spots" of disease that can kill
wildlife and endanger lives veterinary scientists warn today. Bird tables,
they say, could pose the worst problem by harbouring "heavy contaminations"
of bacteria, including strains of _E.coli_ and _Salmonella_. The stress of
scrabbling among themselves for the food makes the birds even more
susceptible to disease.
A report, published in today's issue of The Veterinary Record states: "The
small amount of feeding space available to each bird leads to aggressive
behaviour and male dominance of the feeding stations, stressing the birds
and increasing their susceptibility to infectious diseases. These
infectious diseases may then infect other species of wild birds in the
vicinity and may also pose a threat to human health."
Research into the deaths of greenfinches, chaffinches, bullfinches and
siskins in Scotland discovered that they were caused by a range of
infectious diseases linked to people feeding the birds in winter.
Scientists have also discovered outbreaks of lethal super-bugs known as
megabacteria - 40 times the size of normal harmful bacteria in birds - in
the wild in Britain for the first time.
Until now, megabacteria have only been found among captive budgerigars,
canaries and parrots, although they have been found in the wild abroad. The
report by scientists at several Scottish Agricultural College research
centres and the Government's Central Veterinary Laboratory near Weybridge,
Surrey, says: "Encouraging the congregation of large numbers of birds in a
small area, sometimes for prolonged periods, is likely to result in heavy
microbiological contamination of the feeding stations."
Thomas Pennycott, a veterinary pathologist at the SAC Avian Health Unit at
Auchincruive, near Ayr, said: "It may be that feeding them over a wider
area would help because that would reduce the risk of creating
concentrations of infected droppings in one place. People should disinfect
their bird tables every day, remove uneaten scraps of food, and make sure
they wash their hands thoroughly."

Megabacteria in Diseased and Healthy Budgerigars, Dr. John R Baker
Megabacteria are associated with disease and death in Budgerigars and a
range of other birds. They inhabit the proventriculus or true stomach where
they cause changes in the structure and function of the organ. The
proventriculus becomes dilated and the wall thickened; the production of
digestive juices is impaired; excess mucus is produced and there may be
ulceration at each junction of the proventriculus and gizzard. The disease
is extremely common in exhibition Budgerigars in the UK and is the major
cause of illness and death in these birds.
