North Carolina's corrections department has suspended all inmate transfers
between prisons to try to halt an outbreak of a potentially
life-threatening bacterial infection in 3 prisons.
2 inmates with confirmed staphylococcal infections, and 17 others with
suspected infections, were isolated on Thu 22 Jul 2004 at the Lanesboro
Correctional Institute in Polkton, said Pam Walker, NC Department of
Correction's public information officer.
The outbreak in 3 Anson County prisons is the 1st for the state's prison
system, said Dr. Paula Smith, director of the department's health division.
Similar outbreaks have occurred at prisons across the country, including
one in Mississippi, in 2000 -- that prompted a warning from the CDC -- and
one fatality in 2003, in an Ohio prison.
The 1st of the NC cases of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_
(MRSA) was diagnosed 16 Jul 2004. The 2nd was diagnosed Wed 21 Jul 2004.
6 men from Brown Creek Correctional Institute, 8 from Lanesboro
Correctional Institute, and 5 from Anson Correctional Center are being
treated with antibiotics similar to ciprofloxacin, because the bacterium is
resistant to penicillin-type drugs.
The 3 prisons are clustered together in Polkton, about 45 miles southeast
of Charlotte, and share medical staff that travel among the facilities,
Walker said. The 3 prisons hold 2024 men combined.

whether the strain, or strains, involved are community-associated. - Mod.LL]
