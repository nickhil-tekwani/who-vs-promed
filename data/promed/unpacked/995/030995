Officials in Finland are trying to find the source of a _Salmonella_ outbreak that has sickened almost 30 people. Between March [2022] and July [2022], 27 people in different parts of Finland have fallen ill with _Salmonella [enterica_ serotyype] Mbandaka infections. Of the patients, 20 are women. Their average age is 30 years old and the age range is from less than 1 to 74 years old.

Interviews with those who were ill revealed that 17 of 20 had eaten outside the home before becoming sick, said the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). The Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) and local food control authorities are tracing potential sources based on information given in the interviews.

Overall the number of _Salmonella_ cases has decreased in the past 10 years in Finland. In 2021, under 500 non-outbreak cases were reported. A total of 46 foodborne outbreaks were reported in 2021 affecting 1378 people compared to 34 with 543 people sick in 2020. A major _Salmonella_ outbreak affected more than 700 people. The implicated food was a salad with iceberg lettuce, cucumber and peas served in several kindergartens. Overall, 7 _Salmonella_ outbreaks sickened 824 people compared to 3 outbreaks with 21 sick in 2020.
