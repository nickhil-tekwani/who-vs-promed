For several weeks [chikungunya virus infection] became epidemic in the
Bengkalis community. Currently, the illness that is spread by
[_Aedes_] mosquitoes has become epidemic in the Indragiri Hulu (Inhu)
regency.

In this last week several residents of Inhu suffered chikungunya
[virus] illness. Cases were reported in several places, including West
Rengat and Lirik.

From results of the team's inspection of the health in the area, they
indeed suspected [that the residents] were infected by chikungunya
[virus]. The Head of the Health Section in Inhu, Helmi A Manaf,
confirmed that the chikungunya illness had become an epidemic in his
area. "This is just the 1st time that this illness has been found in
Inhu and we were trying to anticipate it," he said.

He said the health officials from Diskes and the community health
centre were sent to villages to give medical treatment to the
sufferers, and give counseling but also will do fogging. "We hope the
outbreak of the illness will not increasingly spread in the Inhu
community," he explained.

In counseling that was carried out, the community was urged to always
maintain the cleanliness of the environment and avoid [water-holding
locations that can become a breeding site for mosquitoes.] "We are not
only trying to combat the chikungunya outbreak, but also the outbreaks
of dengue fever," he added.
