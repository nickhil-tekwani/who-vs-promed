A fungus is causing Florida oranges to drop early
-------------------------------------------------
A fungal disease is affecting all types of orange trees statewide [in Florida] right now. It's called PFD, or post bloom fruit drop. The fungus causes oranges to fall off prematurely. An orange grower in Southwest Florida said he's heard "horror stories" about PFD from growers. "This disease has just annihilated their whole crop." He thinks it's going to be "very, very, very bad."

University of Florida's Megan Dewdney said there's a combination of factors contributing to the current fungal spread in Florida. For one, the orange trees are already stressed from battling the citrus greening disease, so they're blooming at odd times. And then El Ni√±o brought more rain than normal for winter. The unusual blooms plus unusual rains allowed the fungus to thrive.

Dewdney said this is a widespread problem throughout the state, but we won't know the extent of crops lost until the summer [2016].

[Both _Colletotrichum acutatum_ and _C. gloeosporioides_ have been reported as causes of post bloom fruit drop (PBFD) which can affect all species and cultivars of citrus. The disease is widespread throughout the subtropical Americas with serious crop losses reported in high rainfall areas. Symptoms include water-soaked lesions on petals which darken over time, premature drop of developing fruitlets, as well as lesions and distortions on leaves surrounding an infected inflorescence.

Fungal spores are spread by wind-blown rain, insects, human activities, or with infected plant material. The fungi survive between seasons on leaves and twigs. Disease management mainly relies on timely applications of systemic fungicides and orchard sanitation.

PBFD was reported for the 1st time in Florida in 1983, with several outbreaks until 1998. Since then, no major outbreaks occurred until 2014, but PBFD is now considered a re-emerging disease in the US (ProMED-mail post 20150413.3293616). Citrus greening (huanglongbing, HLB) caused by _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus was reported for the 1st time in Florida in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683), with an estimated 90 per cent of commercial citrus plantings affected today (see link below). The re-emergence of PBFD in trees weakened by HLB illustrates the often unforeseen detrimental interactions between even unrelated pathogens occurring simultaneously in the same host.

Species and strains in the genus _Colletotrichum_ cause a range of anthracnose and other diseases on a wide range of crops. Some of the pathogens, including _C. acutatum_, are now considered species complexes.
