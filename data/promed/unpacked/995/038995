Citation: Halfmann P, Hatta M, Chiba S, Maemura T, et al. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Domestic Cats. New England Journal of Medicine (Correspondence). 13 May 2020. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc2013400.

To the editor:

Reports of human-to-feline transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and of limited airborne transmission among cats prompted us to evaluate nasal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 from inoculated cats and the subsequent transmission of the virus by direct contact between virus-inoculated cats and cats with no previous infection with the virus. Three domestic cats were inoculated with SARS-CoV-2 on day 0. One day after inoculation, a cat with no previous SARS-CoV-2 infection was cohoused with each of the inoculated cats to assess whether transmission of the virus by direct contact would occur between the cats in each of the 3 pairs. Nasal and rectal swab specimens were obtained daily and immediately assessed for infectious virus on VeroE6/TMPRSS2 cells.

On day 1, we detected virus from 2 of the inoculated cats. By day 3, virus was detectable in all 3 inoculated cats, with continued detection of virus until day 5 in all cats and until day 6 in 2 of the 3 cats.

The cats with no previous infection were cohoused with the inoculated cats on day 1. Two days later (day 3), one of the cats with no previous infection had infectious virus detected in a nasal swab specimen, and 5 days later, virus was detected in all 3 cats that were cohoused with the inoculated cats. Virus titers in the cats that were cohoused with the inoculated cats peaked at 4.5 log10 plaque-forming units per milliliter, and virus shedding lasted 4-5 days. No virus was detected in any of the rectal swabs tested. Although there have been reports of symptomatic infected cats, none of the cats in our study showed any symptoms, including abnormal body temperature, substantial weight loss, or conjunctivitis. All the animals had IgG antibody titers between 1:5120 and 1:20 480 on day 24 after the initial inoculation.

With reports of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to domestic cats and to tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo, coupled with our data showing the ease of transmission between domestic cats, there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human-cat-human transmission. This is of particular importance given the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between family members in households with cats while living under "shelter-in-place" orders. In 2016, an H7N2 influenza outbreak in New York City cat shelters highlighted the public health implications of cat-to-human transmission to workers in animal shelters. Moreover, cats may be a silent intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, because infected cats may not show any appreciable symptoms that might be recognized by their owners. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines for pet owners regarding SARS-CoV-2 (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/animals.html) [see comment]. Given the need to stop the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic through various mechanisms, including breaking transmission chains, a better understanding of the role cats may play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is needed.

Guidelines have also been published by veterinary authorities/institutions in other countries, such as the German version, published by FLI at https://www.openagrar.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/openagrar_derivate_00029177/Empfehlung-Umgang-mit-empfaenglichen-Haustieren_23-04-2020.pdf.

A serosurvey in China revealed 10-15% positive cats in Wuhan (20200403.7179946). Researchers from the universities of Padua and Venice undertook a serosurvey for SARS-CoV-2 covering the domestic cat population of the town Vo (20200422.7256272). A similar survey has been initiated by the Utrecht university. According to a media report dated 7 Apr 2020, "scientists at the Free University of Berlin are carrying out PCR tests similar to those on humans to detect whether COVID-19 has spread to pets. One virologist said cats appeared to be more vulnerable than dogs and could become 'carriers.' However, there have been no reported cases of humans being infected by their pets" (https://tinyurl.com/yar94psp).

In view of the growing evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in domestic cats, the possible cat-to-cat infection as demonstrated in the above (small-scale) experimental infection trial and by the earlier Harbin trial (20200402.7173286), and while anticipating results of the various serosurveys in cat populations, the following ProMED-mail comment, published in 20200501.7289409, is duplicated: Stray cats should be kept away, as far as possible, from the premises of sheltered facilities for the elderly to protect the health of the inhabitants and their owned pets. - Mod.AS]
