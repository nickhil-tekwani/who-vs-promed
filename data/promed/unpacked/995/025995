During April 2021 we experienced cold dry conditions which haven't been seen in some years. Much of the country has received, or is about to receive, rain together with an increase in temperatures. This could cause problems. _Rhizoctonia solani_ will be a threat especially early in the season. Emerging sprouts may be attacked and later on the base of the stem will become vulnerable. Symptoms could appear as blackened sprouts, causing secondary sprouts to grow -- these may also become infected. Sprouts may not emerge under severe attack.

Chemical options [are] available for protection against _Rhizoctonia solani_. The use of biological agents is gaining speed and being recognised as a potential alternative to protect crops against the pathogen. Naturally occurring soil bacteria such as specific strains of _Pseudomonas_ sp. are used in the organic sector. This alternative provides a reasonable level of preventative activity and is approved for the reduction of _R. solani_ on seed potatoes. The use of bacterial defences, for example, _Bacillus subtilis_, are already being tested [for] controlling this disease. Other options for integrated pest management include novel varieties and some biofumigation methods.

[_Rhizoctonia solani_ (Rs; synonym _Thanatephorus cucumeris_) is a ubiquitous soil borne fungus associated with damping-off, root rot, basal stem rot (foot rot), and fruit rot in a large number of crops, including cereals, pasture grasses, oilseed rape, and pulses. The fungus causes crop damage by pruning the root system, which results in water and nutrient stress to the plant. Its wide host range makes it difficult to control by crop rotation. A number of fungal anastomosis groups (AG) have been identified, according to hyphal incompatibility. They vary in host specificity, different AGs affect monocotyledons (such as cereals) and dicotyledons (including brassicas). Hosts are generally most susceptible in the seedling stage. Yield losses of up to 50 percent have been reported in cereal crops.

Symptoms of Rs in potato may include cankers on above ground stems, complete stem death can occur; tubers may develop black scurfy lesions, 'elephant hide', deformations and cracks. Tuber quality is reduced and yield losses of up to 30% have been reported. Some AGs are more damaging to potatoes than others.

The pathogen survives in the upper soil, compost, and infected plant debris, inoculum levels increase on the roots of host plants. Since the fungus has a wide host range, it is difficult to control by crop rotation. Disease management may include seed treatments, cultural practices (such as fertiliser applications, timing of planting, weed management during non-crop periods, selection of the style of seed drill), and use of resistant crop varieties.

High levels of inoculum in the soil increase the risk of crop damage. Other factors, especially soil suppressive activity, which is a function of the population, activity, and composition of the soil microbial community, also play a role in disease development. Simultaneous high soil inoculum and reduced soil suppressive activity compound rhizoctonia risk further.

Amongst the most common biocontrol agents used for most classes of pathogens are bacterial species of the genera _Bacillus_ and _Pseudomonas_. Several species in these genera have shown pathogen inhibitory and plant growth promoting properties, with their presence resulting in 'suppressive soils' for a range of crop diseases.
