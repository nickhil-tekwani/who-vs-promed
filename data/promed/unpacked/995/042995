Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 29 Sep 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 29 Sep 2020
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: _Bacillus anthracis_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Fairground Community, District # 3, Buchanan City, Grand Bassa
Date of start of the outbreak: 29 Sep 2020
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Other
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Cattle / 5 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: A very small-scale production system where the breeding stocks are purchased in Monrovia (Country Capital) from cattle traders. The cattle traders import live cattle from neighbouring countries. The cattle are raised in semi-free-range system in a residential environment of the county capital, Buchanan, Grand Bassa County. The farmer carries the animals on the field for grazing during the day and a shelter is provided at night. Also, there is no treatment or vaccination regimen for the animals.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 20 / 20 / 100 / 20
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: A One Health investigation was immediately initiated to prevent human infections. Also, cattle are imported for breeding from neighbouring countries and limited inspections are done due to low trained veterinary paraprofessionals at entry points.

Control measures:
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; traceability; quarantine; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: screening

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Leon Quist Ledlum Central Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (National laboratory)/ Cattle / smears evaluation / 29 Sep 2020 / Positive

Future Reporting: The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[The OIE map shows this outbreak essentially on the coast of Grand Bassa, well away from the interior.

Although this report to OIE shows real insights, the reality is that Liberia has suffered from a weak government veterinary service for many years. Note that the Central Laboratory depends on blood smears for disease confirmation, not culturing, not PCR. And that "there is no treatment or vaccination regimen for the animals". They are in urgent need of help.

One can only guess at the possible origin of this outbreak, apart from the obvious. In that they are actively importing livestock from the surrounding countries opens the possibility that this animal had a latent infection which activated. If the Central Laboratory had a culture ability, a PCR analysis would reveal any genetic links. If they still have the stained blood smear, any spores on the slide would still be viable for an interested laboratory to grow and test the genetics. - Mod.MHJ
