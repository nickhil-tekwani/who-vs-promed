Measles alert after outbreak in schools across Lanarkshire
----------------------------------------------------------
Parents have been warned of a measles outbreak after 9 cases were confirmed in Lanarkshire. NHS [National Health Service] Lanarkshire has written to all parents with children attending Newmains Nursery Centre, Morningside Primary in Newmains and Larkhall Academy to inform them of the situation. The parents have been offered health advice and the option of the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella] vaccine where suitable for some children and young people. Those affected are currently recovering at home.

More than 94 percent of children attending these schools have had at least one dose of the MMR vaccine -- a statistic Dr David Cromie says is "encouraging." The consultant in public health medicine said: "Although the cases caught measles in their own communities, some of them have attended local schools and could spread the illness to others.

"MMR vaccination provides good individual protection against measles and a high uptake rate in a social group helps prevent measles from spreading. So, it is very encouraging that more than 94 percent of children attending these schools have had at least one dose of MMR. However, we are recommending that all children should have at least one dose of MMR and those who are over 40 months of age should have 2 doses of MMR vaccine. Those who would benefit from MMR vaccine are being offered the jab by public health nurses."

Measles is a very infectious disease which is caused by a virus. It is spread from person to person by sneezing and coughing. Dr Cromie added: "Measles used to be a common disease of childhood but is currently rare. Most people who get measles get a fever, rash, runny nose, sore throat -- with white spots in the mouth -- and cough. They can feel quite unwell for a week and usually recover completely within a few weeks, but for some it can be very severe and even life threatening."

North Lanarkshire Council have confirmed that they have no plans to close Newmains Nursery Centre and Morningside Primary in Newmains tomorrow. A spokesperson for South Lanarkshire Council said: "We can confirm that NHS Lanarkshire issued a letter to the parents of children at Larkhall Academy to advise of an outbreak of measles amongst a small number of young people. The letter offers health advice and the option of the MMR vaccine where suitable for some children and young people. The school remains open as normal. NHS Lanarkshire is encouraging anyone concerned that they or their children may have measles to contact their GP.

[This report reinforces the prediction that elimination of outbreaks of measles will not be achieved until at least 95 percent of a susceptible population receive 2 does of the MMR vaccine.

A measles epidemic has been declared in Congo-Kinshasa [the Democratic Republic of Congo], affecting Kasai Orientale Province and Equateur province, according to the Secretary General at the Ministry of Health, Pierre Lokadi. He has stated that this is due to several factors, including the lack of vaccines.

The Secretary General promises that the Ministry and its [international] partners, will respond with a through a country-wide campaign to control the outbreak. "It is planned to organize follow-up campaigns to prevent the recurrence of measles. But this has not been achieved yet because of an inadequate supply of vaccine. Pierre Lokadi stated that there will soon be sufficient vaccine to enable us to deal with these epidemics.

GPs advised to be aware of possible measles outbreak
-------------------------------------------------
Parents and family physicians in the city have been warned to remain aware of a possible increase in measles cases during the current winter onset phase. Prof. Ayesha Mehnaz, Chairperson, Paediatrics Department, Civil Hospital, Karachi talking to APP [Associated Press of Pakistan] on Thu 22 Nov 2012 stated that the province went through an outbreak of measles last year [2011] and it would be appropriate that relevant care-providers are fully conscious of the possibility of this occurring this year also. Rashes, red marks, possibly fever and viral flu-like symptoms such as running nose, sore throat and cough are some of the manifestations of measles that must not be ignored under any situation, she said.

In answer to another question, Prof. Ayesha Mehnaz said sporadic cases of measles have been reported already to her hospital from different parts of the city.

Delay in referral and inability of patients to receive timely care can lead to complication that may include empylitis [encephalitis ?], aggravated malnutrition, gastroenteritis and even death, she said.

Children die of measles in Shabqadar
----------------------------------
A total of 3 children died due to measles in Shabqadar, Charsadda district, on Sunday [18 Nov 2012]. A resident of Shabqadar Kifayatullah, said the deceased were 2 2-year old children and one 3-year old child. "Many children have been affected by the measles outbreak, but the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Health Department is not even aware of it," the resident said, adding that the infected children have been moved to the Khyber Teaching Hospital in Peshawar.

EDO [?] Health Dr Fazal Akbar, however, said that the deaths of the minors had not been confirmed. "Health officials have informed us about the epidemic, but we are not sure about the death toll," he said. Meanwhile, an administrative official at Tehsil Headquarters Hospital said that due to lack of medical facilities and doctors, the disease was spreading out of control.

Residents of Shabqadar told The Express Tribune that few people had immunised their children against measles. Some parents also complained that their children caught the infectious disease despite being vaccinated. One villager alleged that the Health Department had neglected their area in the vaccination drive, adding that an immunisation drive is necessary. The government will be responsible if precious lives are lost, he said.

On Wednesday [14 Nov 2012], a 3-year-old boy infected with the disease died in a village in Upper Swat, where 14 others were brought in with similar symptoms. The child was identified as a resident of Shahoo village of Kalam. 2 months before, more than 100 children were reported with measles in Kalam. In North Waziristan, and at least 18 children lost their lives due to a measles outbreak in April [2012].

In all these incidents, the local population has claimed that a lack of vaccine, doctors and medicines have worsened the situation, while health departments have denied these claims and are assuring the people that immediate steps will be taken to ensure that every child is immunised against the disease.

Another toddler falls prey to measles
-------------------------------
A child died on Wednesday [21 Nov 2010] after contracting measles in Kalam's Gul Abad village in Upper Swat. The 3-year-old child was the 2nd child who died because of the recent outbreak of measles in which more than 100 children were affected, according to official sources. The disease also claimed the lives of 5 more children in Kalam and Matiltan areas 4 months back (See also: ProMED-mail Measles update 2012 (41) part [2]).

The death occurred at a time when the District Health Department said it was sending fresh teams to inoculate children in the area. Locals, however, claim that only those areas where deaths occurred are being covered and the rest are being left out. According to the Health EDO [?], the Expanded Programme for Immunisation (EPI) has been started in upper Swat, where more than 300 children were recently inoculated.

"The increase in measles and other viral disease cases in the area has been caused by treatment from unqualified medical practitioners. Parents also don't pay heed to their children's initial treatment. Then only when their condition worsens, they go to quacks instead of qualified doctors, and substandard treatment by the quacks leaves children in critical condition," said an official at Kalam Tehsil Hospital (KTH).

On the other hand, locals say that there are no facilities at the KTH, so people are compelled to look elsewhere for treatment. They demanded that the government take steps to facilitate the area's only hospital by installing all necessary health facilities and hiring doctors with the required qualifications.
