Further Hendra virus information: Rockhampton and Ingham cases
--------------------------------------------------------------
Biosecurity Queensland has received further test results on 2 horses and a dog which were resampled earlier this week [week of 8 Jun 2012] after showing initial positive results for Hendra virus.

The results are not definitive, which is not unexpected in cases such as these. The testing process is complicated and caution needs to be taken in drawing conclusions.

Based on today's [8 Jun 2012] results, more samples will be taken early next week for further testing at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong.

Biosecurity Queensland continues to work closely with the owners. The animals remain isolated on the 2 quarantined properties and are monitored daily.

Clarifying the disease status of these animals and managing this current Hendra virus response are the top priorities of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF).

[Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Rick Symons]
