First report of European stone fruit yellows phytoplasma in Slovenia
--------------------------------------------------------------------
European stone fruit yellows (ESFY) phytoplasma occurs in Slovenia. Severe
symptoms of leptonecrosis were observed in peach and apricot trees in the
sub-Mediterranean region in the western part of Slovenia (Nova Gorica) 1999
and in 2000, a European stone fruit yellows caused by phytoplasmas
belonging to apple proliferation group (16SrX) was confirmed by laboratory
testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), nested PCR, and restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses.
The presence of a vector, _Cacopsylla pruni_ (Cp), was observed in the
ESFY-infected areas and found positive for the disease. Recently, a
progression of ESFY in Slovenia was reported, based on visible signs. The
disease can spread by infested Cp and infected plants for planting,
especially where sensitive cultivars of stone fruit are grown.
The presence of ESFY pathogen was confirmed by laboratory testing of
apricot, peach, and plum trees from different regions in Slovenia
(Primorska, Kras, Maribor). ESFY is listed as apricot chlorotic leafroll
phytoplasma on the EU Annex IA2 quarantine list, and infected areas are
subject to official control.
A systematic delimiting survey is planned in 2003. Visual inspections of
stone fruit growing areas will be combined with laboratory testing and
followed by destruction of infected trees, spraying of vectors, and
avoiding of planting of sensitive stone fruit cultivars. Control of nursery
stock material and imported material by visual inspection and laboratory
testing is part of official control.
Thus ESFY is present in Slovenia -- confirmed in some parts of Slovenia
where host crops are grown.

[Phytoplasmas are increasingly being recognized as significant pathogens of
food crops. ESFY and other phytoplasmas (apple proliferation and pear
decline) are among the most important phytoplasma diseases of fruit trees
in Europe. Their genetically related agents, all belonging to the
phylogenetic group of "apple proliferation", are transmitted by psyllids
which overwinter as infectious adults. Disease management options include
control of overwintering generations of the specific vectors. Reference:
