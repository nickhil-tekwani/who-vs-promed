Turkey slammed its doors to travelers from Britain on Friday [1 Jan 2021], saying that it had found 15 infections with the new, more transmissible variant of the virus that first emerged in England. All were among recent arrivals from the United Kingdom.

Turkey's health minister, Fahrettin Koca, issued a statement saying that the 15 people infected with the variant were in isolation and that their contacts were being traced and placed under quarantine. In countrywide checks, the statement said, the virus had not been detected in anyone other than travelers who arrived from Britain.

The finding brings the number of countries that have detected the variant to at least 33 since Britain announced finding it on 8 Dec 2020, and the number of countries barring travelers arriving from Britain to more than 40. Some countries are also imposing restrictions on travelers, including US citizens, who in recent weeks visited the countries where the variant has been detected.

The Philippines expanded restrictions on travelers from Britain and 18 other countries, adding the United States after a 3rd state, Florida, reported an infection involving the variant. Many countries have already restricted travel from the United States because of its staggering number of infections -- the most in the world.

California and Colorado have also found cases involving the variant. None of those infected in the United States had traveled recently, so the new strain is clearly circulating, though at unknown levels.

The variant, known as B.1.1.7, has not been known to lead to more severe cases of COVID-19, but its circulation is likely to portend more infections and more hospitalizations at a time when many countries are already battling surges in caseloads and anticipating more from holiday gatherings and travel.

The list of countries that have identified infections with the variant has been growing rapidly, and as of Friday [1 Jan 2021] includes -- besides the United States, Britain and Turkey -- Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Arab Emirates.

In South Africa, a similar version of the virus has emerged, sharing one of the mutations seen in B.1.1.7, according to scientists who detected it. That variant, known as 501.V2, has been found in up to 90% of the samples whose genetic sequences have been analyzed in South Africa since mid-November [2020].

The British authorities said they have detected 2 cases of the variant identified in South Africa. In both cases, the infected people had been in contact with people who had traveled to Britain from South Africa in recent weeks. Switzerland, Finland, Australia, Zambia and France have also detected the variant.

And on 24 Dec 2020, the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, announced the discovery of yet another variant, this one in Nigeria, called B1207.

[This virus has been a persistent "stealth" virus in terms of transmission, given that the peak viral loads are seen in the pre-symptomatic stage, and the virus is transmissible then as well as in asymptomatic infections. Hence, the identification of the variants in individuals with no known history of travel or of contact with travelers indicates that the virus is already in circulation in the area.

RNA viruses are known for their rapid development of mutations, many of which are insignificant in terms of affecting disease severity or transmissibility, but some of these mutations may alter the protective antibody sites on the virus and require modifications/alterations in vaccines, hence the concern every time a new variant is identified. As vaccination is just starting, and the presence of these variants has preceded the start of vaccination, it is unlikely the mutations are pressured by vaccination, and structurally are "chance" occurrences.

Unless a country moves to total isolation (blocking any travel in and out of the country), a self-defeating maneuver (and a false sense of security, as many overland or river crossings may not be found), the odds are great that these variants will continue to cross borders and may "replace" other SARS-CoV-2s in the country. It is a question of seeking and finding and highlights the need to continually sequence the viruses identified, watching for variants that may arise under pressure of mass vaccination. - Mod.MPP]

[B] USA: H69 and V70 deletions in the virus S gene since October 2020
Date: Fri 1 Jan 2021 10:23 EST

A coronavirus variant carrying some of the same mutations as the highly contagious British variant may have been in the USA since October [2020] and already be widespread, a re-analysis of more than 2 million tests suggests. Genome sequencing to confirm whether the variant observed in Americans is the same as the so-called B.1.1.7 variant currently circulating in the UK is under way.

Results are expected within days, but the revelations have prompted fresh questions about where the altered virus originated, including a small possibility that it began in the USA, not the UK, or elsewhere altogether. The variant has also been found in at least 17 countries, including South Korea, Spain, Australia and Canada [see above, updated count is 33 countries].

"It wouldn't be at all surprising if at least some of the cases were B.1.1.7," said Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California, who was not involved in the research but whose team confirmed a Californian case of the B.1.1.7 variant on Wednesday [30 Dec 2020]. "It has probably been here for a while at low levels -- but you don't see it until you look for it."

The existence of a new and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant was announced by the UK's health secretary on 14 Dec 2020 after COVID-testing laboratories reported that a growing number of their positive samples were missing a signal from one of the 3 genes their PCR tests use to confirm the presence of the virus.

Further sequencing revealed that such "S gene dropout" was the result of mutations in the gene encoding the spike protein which the virus uses to gain entry to human cells. The variant is thought to have been circulating in the UK since September [2020].

News of the new variant has led to multiple countries restricting travel from the UK or, in the case of the USA, requiring travelers to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test to be allowed into the country. However, the 1st known US cases were detected earlier this week in Colorado and California, and the suspicion is it may already be widespread.

In the final hours of 31 Dec 2020, a 3rd US state, Florida, officially reported a case of the variant coronavirus, a man in his 20s in Martin County, north of West Palm Beach, who had no recent history of travel, the Florida health department said.

To investigate, scientists at the California-based DNA testing company Helix examined the prevalence of S gene dropout among 2 million of the COVID tests the company has processed in recent months. They observed an increase in S gene dropout among positive samples since early October [2020] when 0.25% of positive tests exhibited this pattern.

This has since grown, hitting 0.5% on average last week -- although in Massachusetts, which has the highest number of such samples, it currently stands at 1.85%, although no cases of the B.1.1.7 variant have been announced in that state yet.

Further analysis revealed mutations in some of the same regions of the S gene which are also present in the B.1.1.7 variant -- although full sequencing of the viral genome is needed to confirm whether this is indeed the same variant, or something else.

Helix is currently working with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as it awaits test results on the variant found in the USA. "If we do see the [B.1.1.7 variant], then we might be able to look at whether it was introduced into the USA one time or multiple times, or if it has further mutated," said Nicole Washington, associate director of research at Helix, whose research was published as a pre-print and has not yet been peer-reviewed. "If all the samples have it, then it has probably been here for a while, but if only 1 or 2 samples have it, then it may be that it was recently introduced and we're just at the beginning of seeing it spread."

It is also possible that the variant originated in the USA and then spread to the UK -- although this is unlikely, given that the B.1.1.7 variant appears to be more prevalent in England, Topol said. "However, I don't think it should be known as the UK variant because we don't know where it came from."

If B.1.1.7 really is widely established in the USA, then travel bans are unlikely to work, Topol added: "The variant is likely to become dominant [within the USA] in the next few months, so what we need to do is to outrun it through a combination of really tight mitigation measures, including surveillance and testing, and vaccinating like there's no tomorrow," he said. "The vaccines should work fine."

Even if the variant identified by Helix isn't B.1.1.7, the nature of some of the mutations it contains are concerning because they may increase the virus's ability to infect human cells, added Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, UK, who helped sequence the B.1.1.7 variant.

[The citation for the pre-print referred to is Washington NL, White S, Schiabor Barrett KM, et al. S gene dropout patterns in SARS-CoV-2 tests suggest spread of the H69del/V70del mutation in the US. Epub version 30 Dec 2020 https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.24.20248814. Its abstract follows:

"Recently, multiple novel strains of SARS-CoV-2 have been found to share the same deletion of amino acids H69 and V70 in the virus S gene. This includes strain B.1.1.7/SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01, which has been found to be more infectious than other strains of SARS-CoV-2, and its increasing presence has resulted in new lockdowns in and travel restrictions leaving the UK. Here, we analyze 2 million RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 tests performed at Helix to identify the rate of S gene dropout, which has been recently shown to occur in tests from individuals infected with strains of SARS-CoV-2 that carry the H69del/V70del mutation. We observe a rise in S gene dropout in the USA starting in early October [2020], with 0.25% of our daily SARS-CoV-2-positive tests exhibiting this pattern during the 1st week. The rate of positive samples with S gene dropout has grown slowly over time, with last week exhibiting the highest level yet, at 0.5%. Focusing on the 14 states for which we have sufficient sample size to assess the frequency of this rare event (n greater than 1000 SARS-CoV-2-positive samples), we see a recent expansion in the eastern part of the USA, concentrated in MA, OH, and FL. However, we cannot say from these data whether the S gene dropout samples we observe here represent the B.1.1.7 strain. Only with an expansion of genomic surveillance sequencing in the USA will we know for certain the prevalence of the B.1.1.7 strain in the USA."

Interesting findings... If in fact these do represent the B.1.1.7/SARS-CoV-2 VUI 202012/01 virus, it does not appear to have increased transmissibility as seen in the UK. We await further information on this. - Mod.MPP]

[2] WHO vaccine emergency approval
Date: Thu 31 Dec 2020
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/news/item/31-12-2020-who-issues-its-first-emergency-use-validation-for-a-covid-19-vaccine-and-emphasizes-need-for-equitable-global-access


The World Health Organization (WHO) today [31 Dec 2020] listed the Comirnaty COVID-19 mRNA vaccine for emergency use, making the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine the 1st to receive emergency validation from WHO since the outbreak began a year ago [recognized outside of China on 30 Dec 2020].

The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) opens the door for countries to expedite their own regulatory approval processes to import and administer the vaccine. It also enables UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organization to procure the vaccine for distribution to countries in need.

"This is a very positive step towards ensuring global access to COVID-19 vaccines. But I want to emphasize the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere," said Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant-director general for access to medicines and health products. "WHO and our partners are working night and day to evaluate other vaccines that have reached safety and efficacy standards. We encourage even more developers to come forward for review and assessment. It's vitally important that we secure the critical supply needed to serve all countries around the world and stem the pandemic."

Regulatory experts convened by WHO from around the world and WHO's own teams reviewed the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine's safety, efficacy, and quality as part of a risk-versus-benefit analysis. The review found that the vaccine met the must-have criteria for safety and efficacy set out by WHO, and that the benefits of using the vaccine to address COVID-19 offset potential risks.

The vaccine is also under policy review. WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) will convene on 5 Jan 2021 to formulate vaccine-specific policies and recommendations for this product's use in populations, drawing from the SAGE population prioritization recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines in general, issued in September 2020.

The Comirnaty vaccine requires storage using an ultra-cold chain; it needs to be stored at -60 deg C [-76 deg F] to -90 deg C [-130 deg F] degrees. This requirement makes the vaccine more challenging to deploy in settings where ultra-cold chain equipment may not be available or reliably accessible. For that reason, WHO is working to support countries in assessing their delivery plans and preparing for use where possible.

How the emergency use listing works: The emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies. The objective is to make medicines, vaccines, and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy, and quality. The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.

The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan. These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.

Experts from individual national authorities are invited to participate in the EUL review. Once a vaccine has been listed for WHO emergency use, WHO engages its regional regulatory networks and partners to inform national health authorities on the vaccine and its anticipated benefits based on data from clinical studies to date.

In addition to the global, regional, and country regulatory procedures for emergency use, each country undertakes a policy process to decide whether and in whom to use the vaccine, with prioritization specified for the earliest use. Countries also undertake a vaccine readiness assessment which informs the vaccine deployment and introduction plan for the implementation of the vaccine under the EUL.

As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine. The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety, and efficacy for broader availability.

[We've covered the roll out of the vaccine use in the early days when countries were obtaining vaccine and beginning vaccinations. The importance of the WHO's granting of EUL (emergency use listing) is contained in the 2nd paragraph of this announcement: "The WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL) opens the door for countries to expedite their own regulatory approval processes to import and administer the vaccine. It also enables UNICEF and the Pan-American Health Organization to procure the vaccine for distribution to countries in need." The 2nd sentence -- permits UN agencies to procure the vaccine for countries unable to do so -- is a critical step in working toward equity for vaccinations. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains 218.

Data by country, area, or territory for 1 Jan 2021 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2021%20WHO%20Daily%20Tables%20Jan%201_1609543695.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 25.1% of daily case numbers and 31.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 35.5 million cases. The USA did not report any newly confirmed cases to WHO today (1 Jan 2021), thereby significantly skewing any analyses on today's reports, especially from the Americas region. Brazil was dominant, reporting over 55 000 cases, followed by Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia. Another 8 countries reported more than 1000 cases, and 4 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The European region reported 55.8% of daily case numbers and 52.7% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 26.4 million. Countries not reporting cases include Spain, Belgium (3 cases), Sweden, Israel, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases included the UK, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, Turkey, Czech Republic, and Poland. Another 18 countries reported more than 1000 cases, and 6 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.2% of daily case numbers and 4.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.93 million cases. Iran is dominant with decreasing daily case counts now almost 6400, followed by Lebanon, Pakistan, Tunisia, Morocco, UAE, Jordan, Egypt, and Palestinian Authority. Iraq reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000.

- The African region reported 5.2% of daily case numbers and 5.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.91 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting over 18 000 new cases, followed by Nigeria, Namibia, Cameroon, Uganda, Ethiopia, Algeria, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Eswatini/Swaziland, Kenya, Senegal, DR Congo, Angola, Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and Malawi. Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Madagascar, Botswana, and Mauritania, among other countries, did not report any new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.0% of daily case numbers and 0.88% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 1.09 million cases. Japan is dominant, reporting almost 4100 cases, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.1% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.9 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, although with decreasing numbers of cases (about 20 000), followed by Indonesia (just over 8000), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Thailand reported 194 cases.

Impression: There is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours, even with no report of cases or deaths from the USA.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 1 Jan 2021, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[Holiday weekend reductions in reporting are seen today (1 Jan 2021) with Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Costa Rica and Oman, among other countries, not reporting any new cases or deaths in the past 24 hours. In addition, the USA report is decreased, as are the reports from other European countries, as well as Brazil and India. In the past 24 hours, the USA (171 692), UK (53 285), and Russia (27 039) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 9720 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (31 Dec 2020-1 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (14 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, Brazil (24 605), Italy (22 210), France (19 348), Germany (19 026), India (17 080), South Africa (16 726), Czech Republic (13 361), Turkey (12 203), Mexico (12 159), Colombia (12 105), and Poland (10 896). A total of 50 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 61 yesterday - 31 Dec 2020); 25 of the 50 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 1.0%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 0.41%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 6.5% increase in daily reported cases and a 4.4% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases are over 734 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours and over 83.7 million cumulative reported cases with over 1.82 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new cases, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. The USA has reported over 20.4 million confirmed cases and 354 000 deaths with New York State having reported more than 1 million cumulative cases. The comparative 7-day averages have changed from previous days and may be suggesting that even in the face of decreased reporting over this holiday weekend, there may be an early increase in transmission related to the Christmas holiday last week. - Mod.MPP]
