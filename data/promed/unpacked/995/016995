From: Richard Montali <RMONTALI@NZP.SI.EDU>

I would like to clarify some of the information provided on the recent
ProMED-mail release on elephant herpesviruses. As reported by Richman et al
in a recent article in Science (Feb 19th, 1999) two viruses were identified
as a novel herpesviruses by DNA amplification and sequencing. To date,
neither virus has been shown to be cultivable and no isolations have been
made as reported in that coverage. By these same molecular techniques, the
virus fatal for Asian elephants has been identified as a latent form in
wild and captive African elephants from localized skin and vulval lesions.
There is no evidence that this latent virus has ever caused a fatal
systemic disease in African elephants. Specific transmission of the virus
from African to Asian elephants has not been proven, but in a number of the
Asian elephant deaths, direct or indirect contact with African elephants
was recorded.
The source of the closely related but distinct herpesvirus responsible for
the deaths of two African elephants is less clear; it has not been
identified in any Asian elephants tested so far.
To date, two Asian elephant calves have recovered from herpesvirus (proven
by PCR blood test) after treatment with famciclovir used for herpes
simplex and zoster infections in humans.
It will be most important to dispel any suggestions that the elephant
herpesviruses are similar to herpes simplex as implied in the in the
ProMED-mail release. The elephant viruses are novel, non
alpha-herpesviruses remote from any of the human herpesviruses, and are
considered non- infectious to man. They are also quite unlike any of the
animal herpesviruses and may belong in a previously unrecognized subfamily.
