With regard to the moderator's comments at the end of the ProMED-mail posting 20161124.4650888:

Feline leprosy is the name for a well-recognized disease in cats caused by _Mycobacterium lepraemurium_. This organism is distinct from other species of mycobacteria and can be cultured on some solid laboratory media, as was reported for one of the cats in the study reported. The term "feline leprosy" does not mean infection due to _Mycobacterium leprae_ or _Mycobacterium lepromatosis_, the causative agents of the human infection Hansen's disease or leprosy. Neither of these organisms has been cultured on solid media. With regard to the comment at the end about other animals, to the best of my knowledge, the infections in squirrels have been found only in red squirrels in the United Kingdom and are due to _M. leprae_ and not to _M. lepraemurium_. Thus red squirrels and armadillos and very few apes have been reported to have true leprosy but these reports do not add house cats to the list of non-human animals.

Thank you for considering my comments.
