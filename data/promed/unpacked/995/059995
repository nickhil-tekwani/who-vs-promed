The high quality of discussions in this forum continues with the set of
postings on nvCJD as an emerging disease. I would like to comment on them
briefly:
Given the number and severity of emerging diseases, it would indeed be
desirable to deal with the environmental or social causes prospectively (I
hate neologisms too, so I dig up old words.) Unfortunately, there's no
real evidence that we can predict which human endeavors will be responsible
for disease emergence. By the time the pattern change is discerned, the
damage is generally done. (e.g. TSE-nvCDJ, transportation of A.
albopictus, or introduction of Atlantic salmon diseases to the Pacific NW
by salmon farming, Colombian special forces acting out in the rain forest.)
Surveillance is the key, but it seems that it will be the key to dealing
with newly established diseases, not alas, to preventing the social and
environmental changes that unleash them. A billion Chinese want
refrigerators, a hundred million people worldwide want new farmland, and
Americans all want sports utility vehicles.
Do others feel that the battle is essentially a rear-guard, defensive one?

I have seen Robert's [Robert LaBudde's report. Anyone interested in the
subject should read it. Although the method used is taken from reliability
testing/prediction, and may be unfamiliar to biologists, it is a very
mature method originally developed (as I understand it) for NASA and
extensively used in electronics. One should note very carefully the errors
quoted here, they are narrow. One should also note that the period of
about four years is one where any imminent and significant increase in the
rate (i.e. an incubation period of 10-15 years) should have become apparent.
In my opinion Robert's article is essential reading to allow rational
assessment of any increase, instead of the scare stories so often seen here
and elsewhere.

great deal.
In essence they are not connected directly. One increases the chance that
nv-CJD is BSE derived, the other assesses the size of any epidemic that may
occur. One should remember that exposure to infected material does not
guarantee infection and the likely future levels of nv-CJD is of
considerable interest to those of us in the UK who may have been exposed.

Wilesmith's group has really been valuable in >understanding where things
are and what should be done. - Mod. pc
Not it wasn't. All the important controls were in place well before the
epidemic was modeled and it added very little to our understanding of the
course of the epidemic. What it did do was make those who doubted what was
being said by HMG accept it. The same applies to nv-CJD, but Robert's
analysis suggests strongly we are still well away from any peak, indeed it
suggests that if the existing mode of transfer is the only one then any
peak may be small and far into the future. Since currently nv-CJD only
accounts for about 1/10th of CJD cases the numbers affected may be very
tiny indeed. Let us hope this is the case.
