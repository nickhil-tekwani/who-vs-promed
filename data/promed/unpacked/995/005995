A total of 9 people from 6 townships in central-western Minas Gerais State
have died since 23 Jan 2001 of an undiagnosed disease with symptoms of
fever, headache and jaundiced skin, indicating liver pathology; 7 more
cases and 2 deaths which occurred this week are not yet included in the
official figures. Many of the affected people had been fishing in remote
locations, exposed to mosquitoes that transmit diseases.
Preliminary laboratory results have been inconclusive, and more tests are
under way. In case the outbreak turns out to be yellow fever, the Ministry
of Health has sent 125 000 doses of vaccine to immunize people over the age
of 9 months in the area, which comprises 54 towns and approximately 700 000
inhabitants. Yellow fever has not been seen in the area for 20 years.
