Local health officials are working diligently to pinpoint the source of an outbreak of legionnaires' disease in Orillia.

Eight cases of legionnaires' disease have been confirmed in individuals who reside in or have visited Orillia in recent weeks.

The potentially fatal disease is a type of pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria. You usually get it by breathing in mist from water that contains the bacteria. According to Dr. Charles Gardner, the medical officer of health for the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU), the focus of the investigation is downtown Orillia. He said based on where the patients lived and had been recently, it was decided to start the investigation "in the centre of the city" before moving outward.

"As of yet, we don't" know the source, Gardner told Orillia Matters, who stressed the investigation is ongoing. "The issue of greatest concern would be cooling towers in air conditioning units of very large buildings," Gardner explained. He said other similar "community clusters" of the disease have been traced back to such cooling units. When asked if large downtown buildings such as the Opera House, Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital, Orillia City Centre or Orillia Public Library could be sources, he would only say: "That type of structure, yes."

Finding the source is critical, said Gardner. Once the source is identified and remediated, the risk disappears. "It really comes down to excellent maintenance of such systems," he said, noting in addition to cooling towers potential sources of the bacteria can be showers, fountains, spas and plumbing. "Most commonly, it's these (water cooling) units," said Gardner, noting droplets, carrying the harmful bacteria, can easily be inhaled by people in those buildings.

For people over the age of 50, for those who smoke and for those who have pre-existing conditions, that inhalation can lead to pneumonia and to legionnaires' disease.

Gardner confirmed all 8 patients in the Orillia "cluster" are over 50. He said he could not provide much information about the patients due to privacy issues but stressed "some are quite severely ill." He noted the disease "can be fatal." However, there have been no fatalities to date. It could get worse before it gets better, or until the source is identified.

Gardner said the health unit issued an alert to physicians working at Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital about the outbreak last Friday [4 Oct 2019]. On Tuesday [8 Oct 2019], they expanded the effort and issued an alert to "all physicians." In addition, he said officials have "been following up with sites we've been able to identify with the assistance of the city and commenced (an) investigation" of those sites. That continues.

A "community outbreak" of legionnaires' disease has not occurred in Orillia in recent memory. "It's not uncommon on one hand, but I've never, in my time since 2005 (in Simcoe County), had a community outbreak," said Gardner, who said there was, however, a "facility outbreak" more than a decade ago. "It's something that happens in a community," he said noting there were similar occurrences recently in London and Moncton. No deaths were reported in either case.

It's important to note the bacteria don't spread from person to person and are not contagious. "The risk to residents and visitors is very low. At this time, we do not recommend Orillia residents to change their work, play and travel plans." He said that "precautionary statement" is just that. "The bottom line is it's unlikely we would change" that stance. "What will probably happen is we will find this source and remediate it and that will be the end of the hazard."

More information and updates about the local cluster can be found at the health unit's dedicated page or by calling Health Connection at 705-721-7520 or 1-877-721-7520, weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.

[Orillia, with a population in 2016 of 31 166 residents, is a city in Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada, between Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe. A map showing the location of Orillia can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Orillia,+ON,+Canada.

Molecular typing of clinical isolates of _Legionella_, if available, can help identify a common source outbreak if the genotypes of clinical isolates match. Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates. - Mod.ML
