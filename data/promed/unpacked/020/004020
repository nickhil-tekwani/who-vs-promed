[1] WHO report
Date: Fri 27 May 2011

An outbreak of severe illness is causing concern in Germany, where 3
women have died and 276 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) have
been reported since the 2nd week of May 2011. HUS, which can lead to
kidney failure, is a complication of an infection by particular
_Escherichia coli_ bacteria. While most _E. coli_ bacteria are
harmless, a group called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) can
produce toxins, known as Shiga toxins or verotoxins, which damage
blood cells and the kidneys. EHEC bacteria that produce these toxins
are known as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or
verocytotoxin-producing _E. coli_ (VTEC), respectively. Many people
have been hospitalized, several requiring intensive care, and new
cases continue to be identified. Some other countries have reported
cases, notably Sweden, which has reported 10 HUS cases, with 2 in
intensive care. All the people affected recently visited Germany,
mostly northern Germany.

The outbreak is unusual in that it has developed very rapidly, and an
unusually high number of cases affect adults (86 percent are in people
aged 18 years or older), particularly women (67 percent), instead of
the normal high-risk groups, which are young children and the elderly.
Nevertheless, cases have also been reported in school-aged children.
The unusual _E. coli_ serogroup O104 is suspected of being the
pathogen likely to be associated with this outbreak. The
epidemiological investigation into the source of the outbreak is under
way. Although the source has not yet been determined, cucumbers are
under suspicion, and the Robert Koch Institute in Germany is advising
people, as a precautionary measure, to avoid eating tomatoes,
cucumbers and lettuces, in addition to taking the usual hygiene
measures in handling fruit and vegetables.

Germany notified WHO of the outbreak, under the International Health
Regulations (IHR), as a potential public health event of international
concern, and the WHO is sharing information with health authorities in
other countries. The WHO has also offered technical assistance and
stands ready to facilitate collaboration between laboratories to
assist countries without the capacity to detect the unusual _E. coli_
serogroup O104. The WHO will maintain close contact with the relevant
authorities.

EHEC can cause bloody diarrhoea and abdominal pain. People who
develop these symptoms who are in or have recently visited Germany,
particularly northern Germany, should seek medical advice urgently.
The complication of HUS can cause acute kidney failure and can develop
after the diarrhoea has resolved. Treatment with anti-diarrhoeal
products or antibiotics is not usually recommended, as these may
worsen the situation.

Regular hand washing, particularly before food preparation or
consumption and after toilet contact, is highly recommended,
particularly for people who care for small children or are
immunocompromised, as the bacterium can be passed from person to
person, as well as through food, water and direct contact with
animals.

The WHO does not recommend any restrictions in travel to or trade
with Germany.

More than 270 people in Germany have fallen seriously ill due to
potentially deadly bacteria detected in imported Spanish cucumbers,
but Madrid said Fri 27 May 2011, there was "no proof" it is to blame.
Russia meanwhile is considering an import ban on all German vegetables
in the wake of the _E. coli_ outbreak.

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's national disease centre, said
more than 60 new cases of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) had been
reported in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number in Germany to
276. At least 2 people have died.

2 German tourists have also been hospitalized in Austria with the
infection, a health ministry spokesman told the Austrian news agency
APA. The men spent 2 weeks cycling to Austria from north Germany
before coming down with symptoms, the spokesman said.

In Switzerland, authorities said a woman returning from northern
Germany also appeared to be infected with the same food-borne
bacteria.

German authorities have identified organic cucumbers from Spain as a
source of the bacteria which has also led to food poisoning in Sweden,
Denmark, Britain and the Netherlands. But Spain's agriculture
minister, Rosa Aguilar, said it was too early to blame her country and
complained the accusations had caused "irreparable damage" to the
sector.

"We do not know where the contamination may have taken place and the
European Commission has made clear that it could have happened outside
the country of origin," the minister said. "Until now nothing has been
proven and it has not been demonstrated that it happened in the
country of origin," she said, adding: "Our level of safety and quality
is extraordinarily high."

A spokesman for the AESA food safety agency in Spain said
investigations were also underway. "The Andalusian authorities are
investigating to find out where the contamination comes from and when
it took place," he said. "This type of bacteria can contaminate at the
origin or during handling of the product." There has been no report of
contamination within Spain, AESA said.

[Now cases have been reported in patients in both Switzerland and
Austria related to travel to Germany. It is not clear that any cases
have yet been acquired in any country but Germany. It would not be
surprising for cases to occur in other countries outside the EU and on
other continents. - Mod.LL]
