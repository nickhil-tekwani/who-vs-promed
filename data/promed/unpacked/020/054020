Abdominal typhus was registered in Armenia
------------------------------------------
According to a Press Center correspondent, an outbreak of abdominal
typhus was reported in Megri, the most southern part of Armenia,
which borders with Iran.
Symptoms of abdominal typhus were recently reported in a 12-year-old
schoolboy. The boy was immediately sent to Yerevan (the capital of
Armenia) for treatment. As of Thu, 18 Sep 2003, the number of
individuals diagnosed with the infection is close to 20, and there is
an assumption that it will rise. Local physicians are trying to
determine the cause of the infection in order to localize it and
prevent an epidemic. One of the possible hypotheses is that it has
been caused by contaminated drinking water sources.

[Abdominal typhus is, of course, typhoid (which means typhus-like).
The word typhus is derived from the Greek tuphos meaning stupor
arising from a fever, vapor, and probably originally from the Greek
tuphein meaning to smoke (reflecting the cloudy mental status of many
patients).
The 2 infectious diseases can easily be confused according to
clinical symptoms. Epidemic typhus is louse-borne, caused by
_Rickettsia prowasekii_, and may have abdominal pain associated with
it.
The other forms of typhus, murine typhus _R. typhi_ and scrub typhus
_R. tsutsugamushi_ (now _Orientia tsutsugasmushi_), are also
vector-transmitted. Typhoid is food- or water-borne, caused by the
Gram-negative bacillus _Salmonella typhi_, and may not produce any
abdominal symptoms. The diagnosis can be suspected based on the
epidemiology of the given case and confirmed with serology
(especially for typhus) and blood culture (for typhoid). - Mod.LL]
