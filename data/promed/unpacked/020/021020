Two people are sick in New Zealand with food poisoning after eating mussels. New Zealand Food Safety warned consumers to thoroughly cook mussels before eating after the duo became ill in the Nelson-Tasman region.

_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ are bacteria in mussels that may cause food poisoning if they're not properly cooked or if they are intentionally eaten raw. People with low immunity, those who are pregnant or elderly should avoid eating raw or undercooked shellfish as illness can be more severe.

Paul Dansted, director of food regulation at New Zealand Food Safety, said: "While the cause has not been established both people who became ill have reported eating mussels and as a precaution we are reminding consumers to cook mussels thoroughly before consumption. New Zealand Food Safety is currently working with the Marlborough and Nelson District Health Board, the Marlborough District Council and the Institute of Environmental Science and Research to ensure appropriate public health measures are taken."

In 2019, an outbreak of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ infection involved 24 people, of which 2 were hospitalized. It was linked to mussels and was the 1st such incident since 2009. In June 2020, there were 8 confirmed cases of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ associated with eating mussels harvested from 2 commercial areas in the Coromandel region.

Cooking temperatures for mussels should be above 65 deg C (149 deg F) for 1 minute. This will ensure any _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ that is present will be destroyed. People are also encouraged to wash their hands with soap and water after handling raw shellfish. One way to know mussels are fully cooked is their shells pop open when boiled or steamed, and the mussel inside is firm to the touch.

Symptoms of infection are predominantly stomach cramps and watery diarrhea and sometimes nausea, vomiting, and fever. They usually occur within 24 hours of eating a contaminated product and last from 1 to 7 days.

[_Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ causes a gastrointestinal illness, primarily with diarrhea.

It is important to stress that _V. parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease the chances of acquiring a case of foodborne illness compared to eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
