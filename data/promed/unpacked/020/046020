First West Nile virus-positive Bird Confirmed in North Carolina
---------------------------------------------------------------
RALEIGH: The State Public Health Laboratory today confirmed that a dead
blue jay found in Cabarrus County is positive for West Nile virus, the
first evidence this year of [the presence of the virus in the state.
The blue jay was discovered by a Concord resident last month and reported
to the Pest Management Section of the Division of Environmental Health. In
response, acting State Health Director Leah Devlin has issued a Public
Health Warning advising residents to be diligent in protecting themselves
against mosquito bites. "Announcing a Public Health Warning is simply our
way of reminding residents to take steps that will prevent mosquito bites,"
Dr. Devlin said. "We knew that West Nile would come to our state eventually
and we have been working closely with the county-level health and
environmental officials to educate the public on what should be done. Now
is the time the folks at home should begin to fully employ the preventative
measures we have been telling them about."
West Nile virus was first detected in North Carolina last year in a dead
crow found at Jordan Lake State Park in Chatham County by a conservation
biologist with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It is important to
remember that the virus is transmitted to humans when a mosquito bites an
infected bird and then bites a human. It is not known to pass directly from
birds to humans.
West Nile virus originates from Africa, west Asia, and Europe. It was first
found in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York City. Since
then West Nile virus has spread down the eastern seaboard of the United
States and to some Midwestern states. With the addition of North Carolina
20 states and the District of Columbia have now reported evidence of the
virus. The other states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia,
Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,
New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and
Virginia. [West Nile virus has also been reported from Iowa and Tennessee
in the past few days, making the total now 22 states and the District of
Columbia. - Mod.CP
Any decision to spray for mosquitoes will be made by local health officials
based upon a number of factors, including whether the area of concern is
densely populated and weather patterns. Experts with the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources' Public Health Pest Management Section
will collect and test mosquitoes in the area to look for further evidence
of the virus. Surveillance for the presence of West Nile virus in the rest
of the state through mosquito and dead bird collection and testing will
continue.
