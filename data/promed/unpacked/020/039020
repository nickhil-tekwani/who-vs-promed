From:  Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>

I believe some clarifications and summaries are in order. I have been
receiving telephone calls and e-mail messages through the last days and
nights and I want to go to bed.
To the best of my knowledge and opinion--
1. The virus causing all the furor in Malaysia should be called a
Hendra-like virus, not Hendra virus. The recently isolated virus already
has been shown to differ from the prototype Hendra virus (1), isolated in
Australia. This seems fairly clear evidence that the Hendra-like virus did
not originate in Australia. Likely, the Hendra-like virus is indigenous
(probably to flying foxes, _Pteropus_ sp.) to Malaysia.
2. Experimental transmission of Hendra virus has not been conducted with
pigs. The virus has been inoculated into horses, rabbits, dogs, cats, and
other species. I would expect that the Australian Animal Health Laboratory
folks will soon be determining the transmissibility of Hendra virus to pigs.
3. Menangle virus (2), also isolated in Australia, like Hendra and
Hendra-like viruses, is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae. There are
many genera within the family Paramyxoviridae; Hendra virus and the
Hendra-like virus may represent a previously unrecognized genus. Menangle
virus and Hendra virus are unlikely to be confused virologically.
4. At present, there is no evidence that Menangle virus occurs outside
Australia, but we have heard this story before. I expect it is just a
matter of time before such a virus is isolated in Asia.
5. We have not seen reports of stillborn pigs or deformities in newborn
pigs in Malaysia or Singapore. Menangle virus causes such aberrations.
6. All isolates of the Hendra-like virus have been obtained from humans.
No isolates of the Hendra-like virus have been obtained from pigs. All
isolates were obtained using a cell culture isolation system, so there is
no concern about Sendai virus as a possible contaminant.
7. Whereas Japanese encephalitis (JE) may be occurring in the Hendra-like
virus epidemic areas, it remains to be determined what proportion of the
human illnesses are due to JE virus and what proportion to the Hendra-like
virus. That characteristic illnesses have occurred in people who had been
given 2-3 doses of JE vaccine speaks to a non-JE virus etiology of their
illnesses.
8. We have no reports of illnesses in family members of pig farmers or of
cases occurring at reasonable distances from pig farms, suggesting that
direct contact, not arthropods, is the principle mode of transmission,
likely direct contact with pigs or their excreta.
9. The apparent age distribution of the cases contraindicates JE virus
infection.
10. We have seen no data regarding overall or age-specific attack rates.
11. It is not unusual to detect antibody to JE virus in people living in an
area where JE virus occurs. As the JE vaccination campaign progresses, it
will be increasingly difficult to distinguish between antibody elicited by
wild-type virus and by vaccine. IgM antibody in cerebrospinal fluid is an
excellent indicator of central nervous system involvement (and perhaps a
predictor of negative outcome); IgM antibody in serum alone is not. 12.
IgM antibody capture ELISA, no matter what you hear, cannot be used to make
a confirmed diagnosis when only a single serum sample is available for a
given patient, human or otherwise. IgM antibody usually, but always,
decreases in titer and may even become undetectable within a relatively
brief period of time (a month or a few months) after infection but in some
instances may persist for long periods of time (years). Paired acute- and
convalescent-phase serum samples must be obtained in order to make a
confirmed diagnosis, otherwise all that can be said when IgM antibody to JE
virus is detected, particularly in an area where JE virus is known to
occur, is that one has made a "presumptive" diagnosis. In the present
situation this is not good enough.
13. The very best people in the world are working on this Malaysian
problem, which may have begun last October. Thanks to the Malaysian
Government, it is very likely that a first-rate clinical, epidemiologic,
and virologic work-up will soon be completed. Most critically,
epidemiology-based intervention techniques will be put in place and the
epidemic ended.
14. It cannot be any but the Malaysian Government that provides official
reports.
15. Insufficient evidence presently is available to indicate the etiology
of two cases in humans in Singapore. Both were in close contact with pigs
(abattoir workers). Whether these have been definitively diagnosed as
having been caused by the Hendra-like virus is unknown to me.
