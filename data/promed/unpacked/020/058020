[1] Europe: surge in cases
[A] Bosnia

Alarm is growing in Bosnia over the escalating coronavirus crisis in the Sarajevo canton, which has recorded the highest rate of cases and deaths in the Western Balkans.

In the 2 weeks to [14 Mar 2021], the canton of Bosnia's capital registered 1763 cases and 31.5 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants, according to data by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

On Sunday [14 Mar 2021], local media reported that 90 funerals were held in just 4 days in Sarajevo.

The number of daily deaths is double the high of 335 registered in March last year [2020], an early peak of the pandemic.

"The death toll in Sarajevo in March has never -- except maybe during the [1992-1995] war -- been higher," a local news website reported.

The government has been under pressure to start vaccinating its population of 3.3 million en masse, but 12 weeks after the European Union and neighbouring Serbia started their inoculation programmes, the country so far has only received some 50 000 vaccines -- mostly from donations.

Bosnia had ordered 2.1 million vaccines under the global COVAX scheme, but deliveries have been delayed.

Adding to the crisis, there have been few physical distancing measures in place for much of the year and a lax attitude towards masks.

Indoor spaces such as cafes and clubs have been open at full capacity until recently when it became apparent that cases and deaths were spiking.

A high school teacher in Sarajevo, told Al Jazeera that he knows of dozens of people who have been infected in recent weeks, and at least 10 people who have been hospitalised due to COVID-19.

"People are waiting in line to arrange a funeral," he said. "When everything [in Europe] was closing, we were a self-proclaimed 'corona-free zone'. People were coming [into the country], dozens of buses from the Jahorina (skiing) mountain were coming into the city, cafes and shopping centres were open. Only schools were closed."

Immunologist Jasenko Karamehic told the Bosnian Dnevni Avaz newspaper on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] that vaccines needed to be procured rapidly for at least 2/3 of the population, or a million and a half people, to achieve collective immunity.

Smaller procurements of 20 000 or 100 000 vaccines could be counterproductive as there is no homogenous vaccination, Karamehic said.

German coronavirus infections are rising exponentially, up 20% in the last week, an expert at the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021], putting at risk plans to lift the lockdown and revive the economy.

The number of cases per 100 000 reported on Tuesday [16 Mar 2021] was 83.7, up from 68 a week ago, and the RKI has said that metric could reach 200 by the middle of next month [April 2021].

Germany is in a 3rd wave of the pandemic, driven by an easing of restrictions in recent weeks just as a more transmissible variant has spread, Dirk Brockmann, an epidemiologist at the RKI, told Germany's ARD television.

"It has been totally irrational to loosen up here. It is just fuelling this exponential growth," he said.

Chancellor Angela Merkel and state leaders agreed a phased easing of curbs earlier this month [March 2021] along with an "emergency brake" to let authorities reimpose restrictions if case numbers rise above 100 per 100 000 on 3 consecutive days.

They are due to meet again on [22 Mar 2021].

The city-state of Berlin has decided to stop any more easing, such as allowing restaurants or cinemas to open, the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported.

Germany's decision on Monday [15 Mar 2021] to suspend AstraZeneca's vaccine could delay progress in reaching herd immunity, analysts said. Of the 60 million vaccine doses scheduled for the 2nd quarter, almost 17 million are from AstraZeneca, the head of the KBV family doctors' association Andreas Gassen told the Handelsblatt newspaper.

"Even if it is only a temporary stop, it will be more difficult for family doctors to start vaccinating," he said.

The decision follows 7 cases of thrombosis in Germany, including 3 deaths, and deals a heavy blow to efforts to speed up a sluggish vaccination campaign.

A planned meeting between Merkel and state leaders on Wednesday [17 Mar 2021] to discuss using family doctors to administer COVID-19 vaccines has been postponed until after the European Medicines Agency completes a review into the AstraZeneca shot.

The German talks will probably happen on Friday [19 Mar 2021], said Rhineland-Palatinate state Premier Malu Dreyer.

[2] B.1.1.7 variant associated mortality

https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2021/b117-variant-linked-55-higher-mortality-compared-other-strains-sars-cov-2


New variant threatens to cancel out the improvements in COVID-19 treatment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The B.1.1.7 variant is very likely to cause more severe illness than pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 variants, according to new research published in Nature (1) reference below].

The research team at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine analysed the results of more than 2 million COVID-19 community tests in England between November 2020 and February 2021.

Linking the test results to a comprehensive database of COVID-19 deaths, they estimated that B.1.1.7 infection was associated with 55% (95% confidence interval 39-72%) higher mortality compared to other strains of SARS-CoV-2 over this time period.

For example, out of 1000 people in their 60s who test positive for the old variant, 6 of them might be expected to die from COVID-19 in the 4 weeks following the test. But this rises to about 9 with the B.1.1.7 variant.

The authors concluded that the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants such as B.1.1.7 threatens to cancel out the improvements in COVID-19 treatment that were made over the course of 2020. This work highlights the importance of vaccination programmes to control the spread of the coronavirus.

The findings build on recent research by LSHTM, published in Science (2), which concluded that this new variant is 43-90% more transmissible than pre-existing variants circulating in England.

Researchers around the world have been working to establish if these variants also cause more severe disease, a threat which this new study aimed to shed more light on.

Dr Nick Davies, lead author from LSHTM's Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, said:
"England has suffered an enormous toll from B.1.1.7 in the last few months, with 42 000 COVID-19 deaths in January and February 2021 alone. In spite of substantial advances in COVID-19 treatment, we have already seen more deaths in 2021 than we did over the 1st 8 months of the pandemic in 2020. Our work helps to explain why.

"The B.1.1.7 variant is more transmissible, and our research provides strong evidence that it also causes more severe illness. This should serve as a warning to other countries that they need to remain vigilant against B.1.1.7, which has already spread to over 90 countries worldwide."

Over the last 3 months, the world has entered a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. While life-saving vaccines against COVID-19 have started to be rolled out in many countries across the globe, SARS-CoV-2, like all viruses, has mutated over time.

Researchers have tracked hundreds of variants of the coronavirus since it was first detected in Wuhan in December 2019. 3 new variants of particular concern have emerged in Britain, South Africa, and Brazil. In recent work, these 3 new variants have been found to spread much more quickly than older variants of SARS-CoV-2. The B.1.1.7 variant was first detected in Kent, southeast England, in September 2020.

In the UK, COVID-19 community tests -- such as those used in home testing kits, drive-in testing centres, and screening programmes in care and nursing homes -- are analysed by a network of laboratories across the country.

The researchers analysed the results of more than 2 million of these tests from between November 2020 and February 2021, a period in which B.1.1.7 spread from less than 0.1% to more than 99% of all community tests. Laboratory tests were able to detect whether the infection was due to the B.1.1.7 variant or not.

In the analysis investigating the link between the variant type and the risk of mortality, the team controlled for the age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, and living arrangement (residential, care home, or other) of each test-taker, and compared rates of death among individuals testing positive with and without B.1.1.7 who live in the same local authority and took their test on the same day.

Professor Ruth Keogh, study senior author, said "We considered the possibility that any link between being infected with B.1.1.7 variant and risk of mortality could be due to other factors and not necessarily a causal link. However, we were able to avoid seeing spurious associations by controlling for several individual characteristics in addition to location and date of test in the analysis, which we used to control for changes in the availability of hospital services over time and geographically, as the spread of B.1.1.7 led to substantial pressures on the National Health Service."

Dr Karla Diaz-Ordaz, co-senior author, added "Our findings are robust to different analysis decisions, for example, correcting for misclassification of the potential variant, as well as accounting for missing variant information, or whether we looked at deaths within 28 or 60 days of the test."

The authors acknowledge limitations of their work, including the possibility that there could be factors relating to B.1.1.7 infection and risk of mortality that were not fully controlled in the analysis. However, the authors believe they have accounted for the most important factors that could result in spurious associations. The findings are now also supported by similar findings from related studies.

From the research published in Nature (ref 1 above):
"Abstract
---------
"SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, a variant first detected in the UK in September 20201, has spread to multiple countries worldwide. Several studies have established that B.1.1.7 is more transmissible than preexisting variants, but have not identified whether it leads to any change in disease severity. Here we analyse a dataset linking 2 245 263 positive SARS-CoV-2 community tests and 17 452 COVID-19 deaths in England from [1 Sep 2020 to 14 Feb 2021]. For 1 146 534 (51%) of these tests, the presence or absence of B.1.1.7 can be identified because of mutations in this lineage preventing PCR amplification of the spike gene target (S gene target failure, SGTF1). Based on 4945 deaths with known SGTF [spike gene target failure] status, we estimate that the hazard of death associated with SGTF is 55% (95% CI 39-72%) higher after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, care home residence, local authority of residence and test date. This corresponds to the absolute risk of death for a 55-69-year-old male increasing from 0.6% to 0.9% (95% CI 0.8-1.0%) within 28 days after a positive test in the community.
Correcting for misclassification of SGTF and missingness in SGTF status, we estimate a 61% (42-82%) higher hazard of death associated with B.1.1.7.
Our analysis suggests that B.1.1.7 is not only more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, but may also cause more severe illness."

"Discussion
----------
"We previously found that B.1.1.7 is substantially more transmissible than preexisting SARS-CoV-2 variants, but could not robustly identify any associated change in disease severity using population-level analysis of early data. This analysis of individual-level data, which controls for factors that could confound the association between B.1.1.7 infection and death, reveals an increase in COVID-19 mortality associated with lineage B.1.1.7. We stratify our analyses by test time and geographical location -- mimicking matching on these variables -- to account for changes in testing rates and changing pressures on hospital services over time and by region. Our findings are consistent with earlier reports by ourselves and other groups assessing the risk of death among individuals with SGTF. Crucially, our study is limited to individuals tested in the community. Indicators for B.1.1.7 infection are not currently available for most people who die from COVID-19 in England, as they are tested in the hospital rather than in the community and hospitals do not routinely collect genotypic data. However, this restricted focus allows us to capture the combined effect of an altered risk of hospitalisation given a positive test and an altered risk of death given hospitalisation, while only the latter would be measurable in a study of hospitalised patients only. Unfortunately, we were unable to account for vaccination status in this analysis.

"We do not identify any mechanism for increased mortality here. B.1.1.7 infections are associated with higher viral concentrations on nasopharyngeal swabs, as measured by Ct values from PCR testing. Higher viral load could therefore be partly responsible for the observed increase in mortality; this could be assessed using a mediation analysis. Alternatively, changes in test-seeking behaviour could, in principle, explain our results. If B.1.1.7 infections were less likely to cause symptoms, but symptomatic B.1.1.7 cases were more severe, then our study could overestimate changes in the infection fatality rate. However, we find no clear difference in SGTF frequency among community tests relative to a random sample of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the population suggesting that variant-associated changes in test-seeking propensity do not explain our findings."

Abstract
--------
Background
Assessment of the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in different populations is essential, as is investigation of the efficacy of the vaccines against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, including the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant first identified in South Africa.

Methods
We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine (AZD1222) in people not infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in South Africa. Participants 18 to less than 65 years of age were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 doses of vaccine containing 5x10^10 viral particles or placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution) 21 to 35 days apart. Serum samples obtained from 25 participants after the 2nd dose were tested by pseudovirus and live-virus neutralization assays against the original D614G virus and the B.1.351 variant. The primary end points were safety and efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic coronavirus 2019 illness (COVID-19) more than 14 days after the 2nd dose.

Results
Between 24 Jun and 9 Nov 2020], we enrolled 2026 HIV-negative adults (median age, 30 years); 1010 and 1011 participants received at least one dose of placebo or vaccine, respectively. Both the pseudovirus and the live-virus neutralization assays showed greater resistance to the B.1.351 variant in serum samples obtained from vaccine recipients than in samples from placebo recipients. In the primary end-point analysis, mild-to-moderate Covid-19 developed in 23 of 717 placebo recipients (3.2%) and in 19 of 750 vaccine recipients (2.5%), for an efficacy of 21.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], -49.9 to 59.8). Among the 42 participants with COVID-19, 39 cases (92.9%) were caused by the B.1.351 variant; vaccine efficacy against this variant, analyzed as a secondary end point, was 10.4% (95% CI, -76.8 to 54.8). The incidence of serious adverse events was balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups.

Conclusions
A 2-dose regimen of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine did not show protection against mild-to-moderate COVID-19 due to the B.1.351 variant.

[First a sobering thought: even though efforts to develop 2nd-generation COVID-19 vaccines targeted against B.1.351 and P1-like variants are underway, the only COVID-19 vaccines likely to be available for most of 2021 have been formulated against the original virus.

The study above highlights certain key points. Various vaccine candidates are in the pipeline against the new emerging variants using the conventional (vector based) and novel (RNA based) platforms. The designs of the mRNA and replication-defective adenovirus (vector based) vaccines can be adjusted to accommodate the key sequence changes present in the new variants. The initial stages of this process are fairly straightforward and can be accomplished rapidly. However, it is not clear whether there will be a need to roll out updated vaccines to counter the emerging variants and how often ...

The authors conclude, "Relative resistance to human neutralizing antibody responses is expected to be a feature of the pandemic coronavirus in the years ahead, as a result of pressure on the virus to select for variants that can transmit despite immunity after natural infection or vaccination. Deliberations on the utility of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine also need to be made in the context of ongoing global spread and community transmission of the B.1.351 variant and the evolution of other SARS-CoV-2 lineages that include similar mutations."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The mRNA-1273 vaccine against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) elicited high neutralizing-antibody titers in phase 1 trial participants and has been shown to be highly efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease and severe disease. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants in the United Kingdom (the B.1.1.7 lineage), South Africa (the B.1.351 lineage), Brazil (the P.1 lineage), and California (the B.1.427/B.1.429 lineage) has led to concerns about increased transmission and the potential of these variants to circumvent immunity elicited by natural infection or vaccination. The recent identification in the United Kingdom of a B.1.1.7 variant that includes the E484K mutation (B.1.1.7+E484K) furthers these concerns.

We assayed the neutralizing activity against recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based SARS-CoV-2 (a pseudovirus-based model) in serum samples obtained from eight participants in the phase 1 trial. The samples were obtained 1 week after the participants had received the 2nd dose of mRNA-1273 vaccine. We tested pseudoviruses bearing the spike proteins from the original Wuhan-Hu-1 isolate, the D614G variant, and the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.427/B.1.429, B.1.1.7+E484K, and other variants (20E [EU1], 20A.EU2, N439K-D614G, and the mink cluster 5 variant that was first identified in Denmark).

Both the full panel of mutations in S and a subset of mutations affecting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) region of the B.1.1.7 variant had no significant effect on neutralization by serum obtained from participants who had received the mRNA-1273 vaccine in the phase 1 trial. In contrast, we observed a decrease in titers of neutralizing antibodies against the P.1 variant, the B.1.427/B.1.429 variant (versions 1 and 2), the B.1.1.7+E484K variant, and the B.1.351 variant as well as a subset of its mutations in the RBD. We detected reductions by a factor of between 2.3 and 6.4 in titers of neutralizing antibodies against this panel of variants. The largest effect on neutralization, reduction by a factor of 6.4, was measured against the B.1.351 variant. However, the geometric mean neutralizing titer against B.1.351 was 1:290, and all the serum samples fully neutralized the rVSV pseudovirus, albeit at relatively low dilutions. The effect of the E484K mutation was observed by comparing neutralizing activity against the B.1.1.7 variant with neutralizing activity against the B.1.1.7+E484K variant. We found a significant reduction in neutralizing titers when the E484K mutation was present. Using both rVSV and lentiviral neutralization assays, we observed a similar trend in serum samples obtained from macaque monkeys.

The rVSV-based pseudovirus neutralization assay was also used to assess the neutralizing activity of serum obtained from participants who had received the mRNA-1273 vaccine in the phase 1 trial against the full-length spike protein of the dominant strain in 2020 (D614G), as well as against 20E (EU1), 20A.EU2, N439K-D614G, and mink cluster 5 variants. We observed levels of neutralization against these variants that were similar to those against the Wuhan-Hu-1 (D614) isolate.

Protection conferred by the mRNA-1273 vaccine against the P.1, B.1.427/B.1.429, and B.1.351 variants remains to be determined. Our findings underscore the importance of continued viral surveillance and evaluation of vaccine efficacy against new variants and may help to facilitate the establishment of correlates of protection in both nonhuman primates and humans.

[mRNA-1273 is a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length, prefusion stabilized spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2.

The data from the study appears encouraging with a pan-coronavirus neutralization function against a SARS-CoV2 pseudo-virus challenge, with somewhat reduced function against new variants particularly B1.1.7, and effect of the E484K mutation related to a significant reduction in neutralizing titers. The study highlights the importance of continuous viral surveillance and evaluation of vaccine efficacy against new emerging variants. - Mod.UBA]
