Man, 60, starves to death as hunger bites
-----------------------------------------
An elderly man has died of hunger complications in Taita [Coast
province] as the district continues to grapple with persistent food
shortages.

And a schoolboy died and 3 family members were admitted to hospital
after eating meat from a cow suspected to have died of anthrax.

The death of the Standard Two pupil at Njoro Primary School, has led
to panic among residents. Bomani Chief Katsungi Mngwana appealed to
residents of Njoro village who may have eaten the meat to go to
hospital for treatment. He said: "Family members were earlier advised
by veterinary officials to bury the carcass, but defied the orders
and instead ate and sold the meat to the unsuspecting residents."

Mr Mngwana said one of the victims had been taken to Tanzania for
treatment. Taveta medical officer of Health Henry Ng'eno said 3 other
people who ate the meat are in hospital.

Last week [week of 23 Feb 2009], famine-stricken residents in
Miasenyi and Buguta scrambled for free game meat from 3 rogue
buffalos shot dead by Kenya Wildlife Service personnel and 3
elephants killed by a speeding vehicle on the Nairobi-Mombasa highway.

The 60-year-old man from Gimba village, Voi, was said to have died
shortly after he was taken to Moi Hospital. Voi DO [district officer]
George Kamweru said he was very weak and sickly. "I was told by family
members that the deceased had not had enough food for a long time and
was frail looking when he was brought to the hospital. He died later
as doctors tried to save his life," said Mr Kamweru.

The DO said the Government would distribute food to famine-stricken
areas. He said some residents had turned to wild roots to survive.
Kamweru said the worst hit areas were Gimba, Ikanga, and Kajire.

It has also emerged that more than 2000 bags of maize in the district
were still lying in a Mombasa depot, 3 months after transporters
allegedly declined to ferry the consignment due to low pay. Residents
and local leaders appealed to the Government to facilitate the
transportation of maize to avert further suffering. National Cereals
and Produce Board Voi depot is empty in a district where more than
160 000 people are in dire need for relief food. Acting DC [District
Commissioner] Raphael Lemaletian said transporters from Mombasa had
complained that they were running at a loss because of low payment.

[Anthrax in Kenya has been under-reported for years. For what it is
worth, OIE has the following numbers of livestock outbreaks: 2001, 4
cattle; 2002, 6 cattle; 2003, 2 cattle; 2004, 6 cattle; 2005, 19
cattle; 2006, 41 cattle, 2 sheep and goats, 2 involving pigs; 2007,
28 cattle, 4 sheep and goats, 6 pigs; 2008 (6 months) 6, all cattle.
Outbreaks have been reported in the following provinces: Central,
Coast, Eastern, Nairobi, and the Rift Valley. There were 15 human
cases in 2001, 106 with 2 deaths in 2005-6, and 10 in 2007. It is
hard to say if the increases in numbers are real or just the result of
enthusiasm in reporting. The passivity of the veterinary officers in
this instance may be telling.

With the increasing human famine problems in Kenya we can expect to
see more instances of human anthrax following the butchering and
consumption of sick and dead livestock It should be pointed out that
this is a rural African problem of many years and not limited to
Kenya.

As livestock are grazed inside national parks -- it is illegal but
done -- we can expect to see not just livestock cases because of
proximity to affected game, but also human cases from harvesting dead
game carcasses. In the past few years, wildlife anthrax cases have
been reported in Tsavo West, Nakuru, southern Samburu, and in the
Nairobi National Park. Tsavo National Park West essentially
encompasses the area involved in this recent report.

In the absence of medical and veterinary laboratory confirmation,
these cases must remain suspect of being anthrax. If any of our
Kenyan members can provide any ancillary information it would be much
appreciated.

How a speeding vehicle can kill 3 elephants is a puzzle unless it was
a long distance truck well laden.
