Re: ProMED-mail Bushmeat trade - Cameroon: disease transmission risk 20120528.1148068
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We wish to comment on the [ProMED-mail post referenced above, published on 28 May 2012]. The sentence, "80 per cent of the meat eaten in Cameroon is killed in the wild and is known as 'bushmeat,'" appears to be an error. While the statistic may hold true for some remote villages in Southern Cameroon, it is not true for the entire country. We have many years of experience working in the livestock-producing Northern regions of Cameroon and have found that people there eat almost no bushmeat (unless one counts wild-caught fish). Also, bushmeat is expensive in the Southern cities, so it may not be common in the diet of the average person.
