Another 2 hepatitis E-related deaths were reported this month [February 2018] in Windhoek, bringing the number to 6 since the disease was declared an outbreak in December 2017. Dr Lilliane Kahuika from the health ministry confirmed the deaths to The Namibian, saying the latest victims were a 25 year old female and a male of unspecified age.

The woman died 5 days after giving birth, while the male victim died on [21 Feb 2018], bringing the total number of victims of hepatitis E to 4 females and 2 males. Kahuika said all female victims were post-partum women (having given birth). "The 4th female victim lost her pregnancy before she passed away," she stated.

Suspected cases of hepatitis E have reached 894, with 90 of them confirmed at the laboratory. 3 people were also hospitalized in the last 2 weeks due to hepatitis E-related illnesses. The disease is still highly concentrated in the informal settlements, with Havana, Goreangab, and Hakahana the most affected.

Kahuika, however, said the cases related to hepatitis E have been declining due to "interventions that were put in place, such as providing clean water, and toilets that were renovated by the city of Windhoek. We just hope it will continue to decline," she added.

Several cases were also reported in the northern regions earlier in February 2018. 1 case was reported in the Oshikoto region, 2 in Oshana, and 4 in Omusati, and Kahuika said these cases were mostly spread by sick people who had travelled there from the Khomas region. She then cautioned pregnant women -- with hepatitis E symptoms -- to report to health facilities before the situation "gets out of hand".

The affected communities were also urged to maintain facilities that are provided to help fight the disease, such as reporting vandalism and the theft of toilet equipment. "People also need to start cleaning up by themselves. They should not wait for a municipality to come and clean for them. We need to take ownership of our health because it is the only way we can defeat the disease," Kahuika stressed.

[This article MAY provide some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:

Kmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al. The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2016; 94(1): 203-11. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0238; available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710431/

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30 per cent. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study."

Of the 7 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation. Those genotypes appear to be transmitted from humans, whereas the others, most notably GT 3, are zoonotic infections spread usually by undercooked pork products. - Mod.LL
