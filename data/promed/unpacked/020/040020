Salmonella at Sheetz still a mystery
-----------------------------------
Investigators still don't know what caused the summer [2004]
salmonella outbreak among patrons of Sheetz convenience stores that
resulted in 429 confirmed cases among people in 9 states.
The search for the source of contamination had a setback in August
2004, when Hurricane Charley hit Florida, home of farms that likely
grew the tainted tomatoes at the heart of the outbreak.
But once investigators finally conducted their farm work, they
determined that food safety practices called for in the 1990s
following tomato-related outbreaks had, in fact, been adopted. That
good news about past practices, however, left officials struggling to
understand the nature of the new problem.
"We don't know how the contamination moved to the produce," said Jack
Guzewich, director of emergency coordination and response for the
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the FDA. "The other
apparent thing is -- and this isn't proven -- the organism can
survive in the environment, on the produce, in the face of the
[safety] things that are being done. What does that mean? What are
the best steps to take? Those are the questions we'd like to answer."
While the number of confirmed cases in the Sheetz outbreak doesn't
make it one of the top 10 of its kind in the United States, its local
impact was huge. In Pennsylvania, 288 salmonella cases were
conclusively linked to the outbreak, although officials believe many
more here were actually sickened. Coming within a year of 660 people
getting sick with hepatitis A after eating green onions at the Beaver
Valley Mall Chi-Chi's, the outbreak at Sheetz was yet another reason
for consumers here to think twice before eating produce from a food
vendor.
Neither the Sheetz nor the Chi-Chi's outbreak was the result of poor
food handling practices at either establishment. But there was an
important difference between them: Green onions served at Chi-Chi's
were grown in Mexico, while the tomatoes sold at Sheetz were grown in
the USA.
"I think there's sometimes a tendency to blame these things on places
that are far away," said Weltman. "So, it's a bigger problem and will
take more systemic solutions than just saying, 'Oh, it's one dirty
farm or one dirty country.'"
Investigators believe that as many as 5 different strains of
salmonella bacteria contaminated the tomatoes served at Sheetz, said
Dr. Amy DuBois, epidemic intelligence service officer with the CDC.
The bacterial variety virtually eliminates the chance that
contamination came from an infected food-handler somewhere along the
food distribution chain, DuBois said.
The most common reservoirs for the roughly 2000 known strains of
salmonella are wild and domestic animals, so investigators tend to
think the contamination occurred either at the farm or in packing
sheds where tomatoes are processed. This is surely cold consolation
for the owners of Coronet Foods, the Wheeling, WV company that closed
in 2004, after it was revealed that Coronet sliced the tomatoes
served at Sheetz.
"Our basic assumption is that the initial contamination happens
probably at the growing or packing shed stage of the operation, and
it is exacerbated downstream from there, but we can't prove that,"
said Guzewich, the FDA official.
Investigators hoped they would be able to recommend safety steps like
those called for in the 1990s, following 2 salmonella outbreaks
involving tomatoes. Nearly 300 people in Midwestern states were
sickened during those outbreaks, both of which involved tomatoes
packed in a single facility in South Carolina.
In that case, the packer received tomatoes from 12 growers operating
within several miles of the facility. Tomatoes were dumped into a
heated, chlorinated water bath in a roofed receiving area outside the
packing house.
Chlorine is key to preventing contamination from bird droppings and
other organic debris that can find their way into a tank, but
chlorine levels were not being routinely monitored or recorded,
investigators found. They also determined that tomatoes placed in
water cooler than the tomato pulp will absorb water and salmonella
organisms into the core tissues through the stem scar. Salmonella can
be transferred from the stem scar into the tomato by a knife blade
used to cut a tomato. When investigators visited farms that grew the
Sheetz tomatoes, they were pleased to see that chlorine levels were,
in fact, being monitored, said DuBois of the CDC. What's more, water
temperatures were being kept up.
Investigators focused on one farm in Florida, DuBois said, and the
FDA might visit that operation again this spring [2005] to observe
conditions during the planting of a tomato crop.
The salmonella story isn't over for the Sheetz chain either. With 307
stores in 6 states, Sheetz derives revenue from more services than
just made-to-order sandwiches, said Steve Sheetz, the company
chairman. So, the overall financial results for the year [2004] were
"very good," he said. But the sandwich business was hurt, and it
hasn't completely bounced back, particularly in areas close to
Pittsburgh.

Given the limitations of basic food borne illness epidemiology, it is
not always the case that the pieces of the puzzle can be linked
