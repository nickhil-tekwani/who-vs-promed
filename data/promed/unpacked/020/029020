A woman heard about the rabid raccoon in her Dickeyville neighborhood soon
after the animal attacked and bit a friend, on 2 Dec 2005. Even so, she was
surprised when, a few hours later, a raccoon appeared out of nowhere as she
walked her mixed spaniel. The crazed animal charged her and clamped its
jaws on the leg of her corduroy pants.
The woman, 61, didn't realize she was at the epicenter of a surge in animal
rabies cases that would spur Baltimore's health commissioner to issue a
citywide public health alert yesterday, 15 Dec 2005. Nor could she know how
frustrating it would be to get all of her rabies shots with a key serum in
short supply.
She only knew at the time that there was an angry raccoon attached to her
slacks. "I tried kicking at it, screaming and waving my arm," she recalled.
"My dear dog ignored the whole thing." Unfortunately, her kicks threw her
off balance and she wound up on her knees, face to face with her attacker.
"I've got the tail in my right hand, and the front left leg in my left
hand, and the back of my left fist under its jaw. And I have it pinned on
the ground," she said.
Neighbors heard her shouts and called 911. One of them came to her aid. "He
walks up and asks if there is anything he could do for me," she said. She
replied, "Either hog-tie it or bash its brains in, please!" He chose the
second option, clobbering the raccoon's head with a handy rock.
The animal tested positive for rabies, the 10th raccoon and 18th animal
found with rabies in the city in 2005. In 2004, there were only 2,
according to the city Health Department.
Animal bites, too, are up sharply in the city, according to health
officials. Most involve dogs and cats, which are supposed to be vaccinated
against rabies. But bites by raccoons and bats -- both well-known carriers
of rabies -- are also up, from 68 in 2004 to 100 in 2005. Some of the
increase might be the result of "increased vigilance," said city health
commissioner Dr Joshua M Sharfstein. But the figures "likely also indicate
a growing problem." In the health alert issued yesterday, he said, "Rabies
is a fatal disease, and city residents need to be aware of this risk. Stay
away from suspect animals, and seek treatment quickly if possibly exposed."
State health authorities said they've seen no major changes in the overall
incidence of animal rabies. "Whether something is changing in the city, I
don't know," said John P Krick, director of Maryland's office of
epidemiology and disease control. "We are not staffed to the point where we
can analyze in depth the rise in numbers."
The increase in animal rabies and bite cases in Baltimore has raised the
demand for human rabies shots. They consist of rabies vaccine, plus a
scarce and costly antibody serum, human rabies immune globulin (HRIG).
In 2005, 68 patients have sought and received rabies shots in the city, up
from 43 in 2004. The rising demand and tight supplies can sometimes delay
treatment, which the patient discovered when she went to the city health
department last week for her shots. Officials there told her they had run
out of HRIG, and her antibody treatment was delayed nearly to the point
where it would have been ineffective [see discussion below - Mod.LL].
The current eastern US epizootic of raccoon rabies (the animal equivalent
of a human epidemic) is "one of the biggest wildlife rabies outbreaks on
record, ever," said Dr Cathleen A Hanlon, veterinary medical officer in the
Rabies Section at CDC in Atlanta.
It began in Florida in the 1950s and spread north, aided by suburban
sprawl, access to garbage, and a human tolerance for animals. It reached
the Middle Atlantic states in the 1970s and has spread explosively from
there. Raccoons are now the most common source of rabies from Ohio and the
Appalachian ridge to the Atlantic, and from Ontario to the Gulf of Mexico.
Their knack for survival in the city and suburbs puts them in direct
contact with dense human populations and their pets.
Laboratory tests have confirmed 300 to 400 cases of animal rabies in
Maryland annually in recent years. About 2/3 were raccoons, followed
distantly by bats, foxes, cats, and skunks. The numbers rise and fall in
cycles. But the statewide trend in recent years has actually been down,
from 396 in 2002 to 334 in 2004. The total through 15 Oct of 2005 was 319.
An exception is Baltimore City. Although its counts are small compared with
suburban counties, they're up sharply in 2005, prompting yesterday's health
alert.
Rabies is a viral illness that attacks the brain. It is transmitted from
wild animals to unvaccinated pets and people through the saliva of the
infected animal. Symptoms, which can appear days or years after exposure,
include pain at the bite site, fever, chills, muscle aches and
irritability, leading to confusion, agitation, seizures, coma, and death.
Hanlon estimated that 30 000 to 50 000 people receive rabies shots each
year. CDC guidelines call for 5 doses of rabies vaccine. They should start
as soon as possible after exposure, and then 3, 7, 14, and 28 days after
the 1st shot. The vaccine, injected into the shoulder muscle, stimulates
the body to produce its own antibodies to fight and destroy the rabies
virus. But development of those antibodies takes about a week. So the
guidelines also call for a single dose of HRIG, ideally with the 1st
vaccine shot. HRIG antibodies are extracted from donated human blood.
HRIG is injected [partly - Mod.LL] into and around the bite, if there is
one, and the rest into a muscle. Its job is to provide immediate -- though
temporary -- protection against the virus while the patient's immune
system, responding to the vaccine, builds its own antibodies.
But to do the patient any good, the HRIG must be given within 7 days of the
1st vaccine shot. After that, the body is presumed to have produced its own
antibodies. The patient received her 1st vaccine shot 7 Dec 2005 at the
city Health Department's Field Services Unit. But the department had run
out of HRIG. Although officials told Davis they expected to be resupplied
in time for her 2nd rabies shot, they weren't. And it was uncertain whether
they would get more in time for her 3rd. So she was advised to seek
treatment at Sinai Hospital.
She went to Sinai's emergency room and -- after 10 hours in the waiting
room -- she finally received both her 3rd rabies vaccine shot and her HRIG
injection. By then, 12 days had passed since the raccoon attack. And the
window for the HRIG to provide her any protection had all but closed.
"That's not ideal. I'm surprised," Hanlon said of Davis' experience.
Sharfstein, the city's health commissioner, said such delays are "a very
common thing in rabies because there's a pretty scarce supply" of HRIG.
"I've been in [hospital] emergency rooms that don't have any when a patient
is there," he said. But he agreed that the delay in Davis' case was too
long. In any event, he said that the patient - who was not actually bitten
by the raccoon - is at "extraordinarily low risk" for getting rabies.
The rabies vaccine is readily available, Hanlon said, although the 3
manufacturers that once shared the USA market have dwindled to one in
recent years - Chiron Corp. But HRIG supply problems are national, she
said. The only commercial manufacturers are Germany's Bayer and France's
Aventis Pasteur. "It's kind of an orphan biologic, not a big money-maker
and sort of a limited supply," she said.
Because it's derived from donated human blood, production is limited, so
the product is very expensive -- $1000 to $1800 per dose. And it has a
shelf life of just 2 years. As a result, health care providers can't afford
to stock much HRIG, and they frequently have to ask public health officials
to help them find more.
Despite Davis' close contact with the raccoon, and despite the delay in
administering the HRIG antibodies, Hanlon said, "the fact that she wasn't
bitten ... probably provided a sufficient margin of safety where she's not
at significant risk."

[It would appear that rabies incidents are up in this area of Maryland. It
may be due to a real rise in rabies, or it may be due to more awareness,
resulting in better reporting.
Clearly, with this type of rise, regardless of the reason, vaccination of
domestic animals (especially cats and dogs) becomes a critical issue in
decreasing exposure to people. When unvaccined pets come into contact with
a rabid animal such as a raccoon, they are exposed to the virus, and put
the pet owner at risk.
The shortage of supplies for post-exposure prophylaxis is concerning. - Mod.TG
Natural rabies is transmitted only when the virus in saliva is introduced
into a bite wound, open cut, or onto mucous membranes. Any penetration of
skin by teeth is considered a bite exposure. Bites by some animals,
especially bats, can inflict quite minor injury and may go undetected in a
sleeping person.
Based on the comments, it appears that the rabid raccoon's dentition did
not penetrate the patient's skin and, if so, one might argue that no
prophylaxis was needed. It is possible, however, that saliva did
contaminate an open cut or abrasion during the scuffle. Aerosolized rabies
virus, in large quantities, has transmitted rabies, with cases occurring
from exposure in a laboratory and bat-infested cave. Organ transplants have
also rarely transmitted the infection.
Several aspects of post-exposure prophylaxis also need mentioning.
1) Immediate and extensive washing of all bite wounds and scratches with
soap and water and a virucidal agent such as povidine-iodine irrigation are
important in preventing rabies. Indeed, in animals, this alone reduces the
likelihood of rabies markedly (1,2).
2) Small rodents (such as squirrels, hamsters, guinea pigs, chipmunks,
rats, and mice) as well as lagomorphs (rabbits and hares) are almost never
found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies
to humans. The woodchuck, quite a large rodent, accounts for most rodent
rabies in endemic areas of rabies.
3) Much of the rabies prophylaxis is given related to dog and cat bites.
This can be minimized by immunizing one's pets against this infection.
4) In my experience working at a number of hospitals in rabies-endemic
areas, HRIG has always been located in town even if it is not in stock at
the institution that requires it. This may well have been accomplished in
the scenario described.
