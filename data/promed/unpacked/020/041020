According to the October [1998 issue of Epidemiological News by the
Sarawak Health Department, a total of 809 dengue fever cases were recorded
in the first 10 months of 1998, a three-fold increase from the 243 cases
recorded in 1997. The increase was due to the dengue outbreak in Sibu
Division last year.
Assistant Minister of Environment and Public Health Dr. Soon Choon Teck
said 28 of the 809 cases were dengue haemorrhagic fever cases.

[We assume that the Oct 1998 report has only just appeared, giving rise to
this news story dated almost 3 months later. Sarawak led the Asian
continent in using a web page to give daily reports of the hand, foot &
mouth disease epidemic 2 years ago. It would be another feather in
Malaysia's cap if they would start putting their Epidemiological News out
on the web, in quicker time than it takes to print & distribute it by
regular mail. We would all like to know what the provisional dengue
figures for the last 3 months are. - Mod.JW
