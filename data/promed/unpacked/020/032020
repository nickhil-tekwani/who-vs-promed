Concern grows over the worsening dengue situation in Kaohsiung City.
That was the word from Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang on Sunday [26
Sep 2010]. Dengue fever is raging in Kaohsiung, with 227 cases
reported so far this year [2010]. Yaung is visiting the southern city
to review the epidemic prevention work there. Yaung said that in
addition to the indigenous cases in the city, there has been an
increase in the number of imported cases of dengue.

Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung has instructed health officials to take
firm measures to combat dengue fever, which has claimed 42 lives so
far this year [2010] out of 55 400 cases reported nationwide. He urged
the Ministry of Education and Training to mobilise pupils nationwide
to join campaigns to kill mosquitoes -- the main carrier of the
disease [virus] -- in their houses and public places.

Ha Noi reported that the disease had hit 27 out of the city's 29
districts. In August 2010 alone, the whole country recorded 19 577
patients and 11 deaths in 54 cities and provinces, according to
reports from the Preventive Medicine Department.

The number of patients hospitalised in HCM City in the 1st 2 weeks of
this month [September 2010] increased 30 percent, in comparison with
the same period in previous months. Children's Hospital No 2 reported
that it had received 555 dengue fever patients since the start of this
month, and on average was receiving between 15-30 patients a day.

The preventive medicine department said it was working with relevant
agencies to take preventive measures in key localities since early
this year [2010], focusing on cleaning the environment and killing
mosquitoes.

Public Health Minister Jurin Laksanawisit stated that from January -
11 Sep 2010, the numbers of patients infected by dengue fever were at
75 852 with 87 deaths. Most patients were found in Northeastern
provinces, followed by the Central, Southern and Northern regions.

However, the Minister said the number of dengue fever patients in the
South was already reduced, but the North and Northeast still needed to
be closely monitored. The Ministry has also instructed all related
agencies to report the progress of problem-solving continuously.

Relevant agencies nationwide are ordered to educate the people on
preventive measures against dengue fever to control disease outbreaks
in each area.

a total of 75 852 cases and 87 deaths were reported nationwide. The
attack rate was 119.53 per 100 000 population. The case fatality rate
was 0.11 percent. The highest percentage of cases was reported in the
15-24 years old age group (27.5 percent), followed by the 10-14 years
old age group (25.1 percent), 5-9 years old age group (16.7 percent)
and 25-34 years old age group (11.8 percent).

In the last 4 weeks, the 10 provinces with the highest attack rates of
dengue infection (per 100 000 population) were Phayao (65.9), Chiang

Malaysia said Monday [20 Sep 2010] its dengue fever death rate
spiraled 53 percent this year [2010], but backed away from a
controversial trial of releasing genetically modified mosquitoes to
wipe out the disease.

"There was a major rise in deaths due to dengue fever, with 107 deaths
so far this year [2010] compared to 70 deaths for the same period last
year," said deputy premier Muhyiddin Yassin.

Muhyiddin said the majority of the deaths could have been avoided, and
urged the public to take action to eradicate the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes -- which spread dengue [viruses] -- from their homes and
workplaces. "We have identified 19 hotspots throughout the country
where the disease is prevalent, and action is being taken to tackle
the situation in these areas," he said.

However, Muhyiddin was cool on a plan to release genetically modified
male mosquitoes designed to combat dengue fever, in a proposed
landmark field trial that has come in for criticism from
environmentalists. In the 1st experiment of its kind in Asia,
2000-3000 male _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes were to be released in 2
Malaysian states in October or November 2010 if the plan had won
government support. The insects in the study have been engineered so
that their offspring quickly die, curbing the growth of the population
in a technique researchers hope could eventually eradicate the dengue
mosquito altogether. Muhyiddin said the project would not be
implemented "at the moment." The field trial for the GM anti-dengue
mosquitoes was developed by a British-based insect bio-tech company,
Oxitec, and was to be undertaken by Malaysia's Institute for Medical
Research, an agency under the health ministry.

[It appears that Oxitech is applying the sex-specific alternative
splicing in insects to engineer female-specific autocidal genetic
systems developed in the Mediterranean fruit fly, _Ceratitis capitata_
to _Aedes aegypti_. It will be interesting to see what the results are
of this approach to dengue vector control if and when field trials are
carried out. Success would likely depend on the released, genetically
modified male mosquitoes being able to survive in nature and compete
with wild males for mating with wild females.

A case of locally-acquired dengue fever, involving a 46-year-old man,
was confirmed in Hong Kong, which was the 1st local [locally acquired]
case in 7 years, the Center for Health Protection under the city's
Department of Health said Wednesday [22 Sep 2010]. A spokesman with
the Center for Health Protection said the Department of Health was
highly concerned about this case of locally-acquired dengue fever
infection since the last local dengue fever outbreak in Hong Kong
occurred in 2002. "We are working with the Food and Environmental
Hygiene Department closely to make an all-out effort to assess if
there is any spread of the infection, contain the infection, and
prevent the spread," he said.

A total of 61 cases of dengue fever [60 imported] has been reported to
the Center for Health Protection in Hong Kong so far this year [2010].
There were 43 cases in 2009, and all of them were classified as
imported.

A young resident, aged 18, returned from the Caribbean with the
disease. Since early September 2010, the government has been
strengthening mosquito control.

"Monaco does not have any indigenous dengue cases," said Stephane
Valeri, Government Counsellor for Social Affairs and Health. "However,

[2010]. There is nothing to worry about for this young 18 year old

He is now in perfect health," said Stephane Valeri.

However, with the announcement of the 1st indigenous dengue fever
cases in Nice, mosquito control, already assiduous in gardens and
public spaces, has been strengthened. The 1st objective is to kill the
tiger mosquito larvae. "The tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_. - JW]

of _Aedes_mosquito vectors, as has been the case in nearby Nice,

preventive actions by Monaco health authorities are justified.

that the trend of disease incidence remains in decline in recent
weeks, and the suspension of national emergency to combat [this
disease] issued this past June 2010 is under study.

In 2009, DHF caused the deaths of at least 12 people, and in 2010, the
greatest incidence of this disease has been registered in the past 15
years in Honduras, according to health authorities.

The total of confirmed dengue [virus] type 4 cases has increased to 12
in Roraima. The confirmation was sent from the Instituto Evandro
Chagas (IEC) of Belem [national reference laboratory] after analysis
of 70 samples.

Two technicians from the Ministry of Health are in Boa Vista to
accompany actions to combat the vector [mosquito]. According to the
chief of the State Nucleus for Dengue and Yellow Fever of the state
Secretariat of Health, Joel Lima, despite the number of cases of
dengue 4 [virus infection] not increasing, it is of concern, because
the disease could spread with time. Due to this problem, health
authorities decided to intensify action in Vila Central, with active
searching for and elimination of breeding sites of the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito.

As of now, there are 6383 confirmed cases of classical dengue fever in
Roraima (including the 12 of dengue [virus] 4), 181 with complications
and 77 with DHF. Last year [2009] from January - September 2009, 2878
cases were confirmed.

Confirmed dengue cases reached 4100 people and killed 17 in Sao
Vicente in Sao Paulo [state]. Although the worst period has passed,
mosquito populations will increase more easily in the [upcoming] hot
months, a continuing cause of concern. Last year [2009], for example,
the municipal Secretariat of Health registered 44 cases of the
disease, with no deaths since 2007.

The Ministry of Public Health confirmed 13 678 dengue cases in the
entire country this year [2010]. Health authorities issued a report
calling for the populace to eliminate possible _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito breeding sites, since the [upcoming] hot season is ideal for
the reproduction of this [virus] vector. The Health [Ministry] did not
provide details of the origin of the cases but specified that of the
21 443 notifications [of suspected cases], 13 678 were confirmed.
