[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest. To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but will be available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.MPP]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 40 newly confirmed cases in China, 8 of which were imported and 32 were locally acquired, 27 in Beijing, 4 in Hebei province and 1 in Sichuan province. No new deaths were reported. 3 new cases were reported in Hong Kong, no new cases reported in Macau. A total of 1845 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, which may change with the significant increase in newly reported cases.

There were 6 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours; 2 were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13 Jun 2020, when 1 conversion was reported each time and 2 cases were reported yesterday (14 Jun 2020). Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327). More in-depth follow-up information on the ongoing outbreak in Beijing can be found in section [1] of COVID-19 update (262): China (Beijing) superspreaders, WHO, global 20200616.7473860.

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

[In the past 24 hours, according to the report at the source URL, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 34 cases and 1 new death, compared with 37 cases and no new deaths during the previous day (14 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 69 consecutive days. Today's (15 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 21 cases were locally transmitted, and 13 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (11), Gyeonggi (4), Daejeon (3). Incheon (2), and Gyeongnam (1). Imported cases were in quarantine (9), Seoul (1), Busan (1), Gyeongnam (1), and Gyeonggi (1). Note that 12 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The English language page (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) has updated cluster information and tables and graphs as of yesterday's information (14 Jun 2020) in notice 376.
Clusters in Seoul include:
- newly planted churches: 166 cases
- Richway in Gwangak-gu: 169 cases
- Seongsim Day Care center: 19 cases
- Elementary school student Gyeyang-gu: 4 cases (source as yet not identified)

- 90% of newly confirmed cases are from Seoul Metropolitan region (Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi province).
- elderly cases are increasing, as are severe cases.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship, and bars and clubs. It just takes one super-spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 237 290 cases, including 34 371 deaths, up by 303 cases and 26 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (14 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 338 cases and 44 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 259 newly confirmed cases (a slight increase from 14 Jun 2020 which was 244 cases).

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4900_0_file.pdf and http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4900_1_file.pdf). Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (259) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 19 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (9 provinces reported no new cases), with only 1 other province reporting 10 or more but fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases (Emilia-Romagna, 11 cases).

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany.

Italy is now 42 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 26 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

Iran on Monday [15 Jun 2020] confirmed 113 more fatalities from the novel coronavirus over the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide death toll to 8950. A further 2449 people tested positive for COVID-19, raising the overall count to 189 876, Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said. A total of 150 590 people have recovered and been discharged from hospitals so far, she said, adding that 2765 remain at hospitals in critical conditions.

Some 1269 million tests have been done in the country to date, Lari said. Iran's daily number of COVID-19 cases dropped to around 800 in early May [2020], but since authorities eased restrictions, daily figures have shown an upward trend, especially in the south western Khuzestan province. Despite the rising number of infections, government employees have resumed work, and mosques reopened across the Middle Eastern country.

[As of 15 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 189 876, including 8950 deaths, an increase of 2449 new cases and 113 deaths since 14 Jun 2020.

Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. As stated previously, with the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. As observed during the course of this pandemic, the increase in cases preceded the increase in deaths by about 2 weeks. That being said, the major increase in cases was seen in Iran approximately 4-6 weeks following lifting of restrictions. Iran is not alone in this observation/occurrence; it is being seen in other countries/provinces/states where restrictions were lifted while there was still ongoing major active transmission. This is a tenacious virus with the overwhelming majority of the world still susceptible to it ...

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 182 950, including 118 283 deaths, an increase from 2 162 144 cases and 117 853 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 207 049 as of 13:30 EDT (GMT-4) on 15 Jun 2020 including 17 433 confirmed deaths and an additional 4691 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, New York Alabama, and South Carolina. In actuality, the US Military is in 8th position (between Tennessee and New York) and one can't help but wonder if there are troops that were involved in Washington DC during the demonstrations.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, unchanged from yesterday (14 Jun 2020). California, Texas, and Florida have high daily newly confirmed cases and may well change the ordering of this list over the coming week or so. A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html) has data on cases, hospitalization, testing and epidemiologic variables such as age, race, ILI (influenza-like illness), surveillance and emergency room visits, definitely worth reviewing, a welcome series of analyses.
