[More information would certainly be helpful and it would be
particularly important to know if any non-imported cattle have had
signs. With no clinical signs in the 3 imported animals testing
ELISA positive and apparently no indigenous cattle affected, it
appears as if there has not been autochthonous transmission of the
Bluetongue virus at this point. Until there is further information
on transmission in Poland, which could come fast and furiously, it is
best to consider this a limited and contained outbreak. A very nice
map of outbreaks in Europe, including this new Polish outbreak, can
be seen at
