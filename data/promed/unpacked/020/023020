On 21 Aug 2007, a hospital in Barcelona, Spain, informed local health
authorities in Girona of the occurrence of an outbreak of
gastrointestinal illness among 3 families who had eaten lunch at a
hotel in Lloret de Mar on 14 Aug 2007. Only one of these 3 families
was staying at the hotel. The lunch on 14 Aug 2007 at the hotel was
the only meal they had shared. Samples for stool culture were
collected from 6 of the 12 affected individuals in this outbreak and
all tested positive for _Salmonella_ spp.

Local epidemiologists carried out a preliminary investigation by
interviewing the 12 cases notified by the hospital in Barcelona on 21
Aug 2007. Information about clients having stayed at the hotel around
14 Aug 2007 was obtained from the hotel manager and from the health
center that usually provides medical assistance to clients of the
hotel.

Affected tourists from 12 countries were detected. Most of these
guests had returned to their countries by the time of the
investigation. Most of the cases came from France; therefore on 26
Aug 2007, the French Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS) and the 4
Spanish autonomous regions implicated were contacted to initiate an
investigation coordinated by the Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia in
Spain. On 27 Aug 2007, a European alert was sent through the Early
Warning and Response System (EWRS). On 29 Aug 2007, after a
teleconference organised by the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control (ECDC), all involved countries were included
in the international investigation of this outbreak. The aim of the
investigation was to describe the extent of the outbreak and
determine the vehicle/source of infection in order to reduce risks of
future outbreaks.

Methods
-------
We defined a case as a person presenting gastrointestinal illness
within 96 hours after having eaten from the open buffet served for
lunch on 14 Aug 2007 at the hotel. We identified people potentially
exposed to the meal using administrative data from the hotel and
information from consultations of the health center providing medical
assistance to clients of the hotel. We described cases identified in
terms of time, place, and person. We carried out a retrospective
cohort study among all individuals who had lunch at the restaurant
and were staying in the hotel in Lloret de Mar on 14 Aug 2007.

For the retrospective cohort study, data were collected through
standardised questionnaires distributed through Enter-net and the
EWRS to all countries with individuals potentially exposed to the
suspected lunch. Collected information included demographic
characteristics, duration of stay at the hotel and exposure to the
different food items served at the suspected meal, clinical, and
microbiological data.

Relative risks (RR) and 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) for the
association of disease with various risk factors were estimated. The
effect of potential confounding factors on associations identified in
the univariate analysis was assessed with Cox regression models using
SPSS 15.0.

We interviewed food handlers involved in the preparation of food for
the suspected lunch and collected information on the menu served,
preparation and ingredients of all food items, and storage and
cooling procedures. Information about tasks of each food handler,
their hygiene habits, previous contacts with ill individuals, and
clinical symptoms was also collected. All food handlers were tested
for the presence of _Salmonella_ in their stools.

Results
-------
Among 271 people potentially exposed to the suspected lunch, 270 were
from 12 European countries and one was from Viet Nam -- the table
(the table can be found at the original URL - Mod.LL] shows the exact
distribution of nationalities. 50 additional people not staying at
the hotel but who had lunch that day at the restaurant could not be
reached.

During preliminary investigations, 56 individuals presenting
gastrointestinal symptoms were identified: 32 from France, 4 from
Italy, 16 from Spain, and one each from Romania, the Czech Republic,
and Albania.

By 30 Sep 2007, we had received 61 completed questionnaires from
potentially exposed people (response rate: 23 percent): 21 from
France, 8 from the Czech Republic, and 32 from Spanish Autonomous
Regions. No questionnaires were received after that date.

We identified 52 exposed individuals from 61 questionnaires. 4 people
staying at the hotel but who had not eaten lunch there on 14 Aug 2007
were not included in the analysis. Another 5 individuals who had not
eaten the open buffet for lunch on 14 Aug 2007, but who had eaten at
the hotel were also excluded. Among the 52 exposed individuals, 28
fulfilled the case definition (54 percent). 12 cases were men and 16
were women. The median age was 22 years (range 2-58). Onset of
illness ranged from 14 to 18 Aug 2007 [the figure 1 can be found at
the original URL - Mod.LL].

The most frequent symptoms were: diarrhea in 100 percent of cases
responding to this question (25 out of 25), fever in 92 percent (22
of 24), and vomiting in 71 percent (20 of 28). All symptoms were
self-reported. 15 cases reported having requested medical assistance.
An adult and 2 children under 5 years were hospitalized. 2 cases
mentioned having had stool samples taken. Both reported positive
results for _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis.

A total of 25 food items were served during the incriminated lunch.
The attack rate was higher among people who ate spaghetti (attack
rate, AR = 75 percent) compared to those who did not eat (AR = 24
percent) (RR 3.2, 95 percent CI [1.3-7.8]). Spaghetti was the only
food item found to be associated with illness in the univariate
analysis.

We also verified the effect of spaghetti as a potential confounder
for the association between the disease and other foods. In the
multivariate analysis, only consumption of pork steak and zucchini
modified the effect of spaghetti. The adjusted RR for the association
of spaghetti with disease was 7.1 (95 percent CI 0.9-61.1). No other
food items were associated with illness after the multivariate
analysis. Out of 28 cases, 19 had provided information on consumption
of spaghetti, of which 15 had eaten it.

Out of the 8 food handlers, 6 had eaten the same food as clients on
14 Aug 2007, 2 of those 6 suffered from gastroenteritis; _S._
Enteritidis was isolated from 4 of them. One food handler who also
had symptoms after 14 Aug 2007 declared not having eaten at the hotel
and had a positive test result for _S._ Enteritidis.

_S._ Enteritidis phage type 21 was identified in stool samples from
the 6 cases reported on 21 Aug 2007 in Barcelona and the 4 food
handlers. Comparison of strains using pulse field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) showed an identical restriction profile for the 10 strains.

At the moment of the environmental inspection, no leftovers from the
lunch of 14 Aug 2007 were available for testing. Refrigerators were
found not to be functioning properly, while access to the washbasin
was difficult and further away from the food preparation zone. There
was no sink in the cold zone. Capacity for food storage was
insufficient and containers all lacked temperature control equipment.
In the restaurant, the temperature of display containers for the
buffet was inappropriate.

Interviews with food handlers revealed that one of the food handlers
who felt ill on 15 Aug 2007 and tested positive for _S._ Enteritidis
had mixed spaghetti with bare hands. Spaghetti was served mixed with
a vegetarian tomato sauce and chopped boiled eggs. The eggs had been
bought precooked and packed in plastic boxes. As part of routine
quality control procedures of the producer, random batches tested
around the same period did not find contamination with _Salmonella_.
No further tracing back of the eggs was done by food safety
authorities.

Control measures
----------------
Food handlers who tested positive for _S._ Enteritidis were
immediately put on leave on 27 Aug 2007 by the hotel and only
returned to work after they had 2 consecutive negative test results.
The kitchen was disinfected, refrigerators not functioning properly
were replaced, and the kitchen's infrastructure was improved
following environmental inspection. A catering agency provided food
until the hotel's conditions met the standards of the food safety
agency. No further cases have been associated with the hotel since 18
Aug 2007.

Discussion
----------
The results of epidemiological analysis strongly suggest an
association between consumption of spaghetti at the hotel on 14 Aug
2007 and illness.

Findings from the environmental inspection support this hypothesis.
It is very likely that the spaghetti was kept at a temperature lower
than usually recommended, as all dishes were left to cool until
lunchtime in the cooking area and without proper protection. The
spaghetti dish may have been contaminated either by the precooked
eggs, directly by an infected food handler, or by
cross-contamination. Nonetheless, we lack microbiological information
to confirm these hypotheses, as there were no leftovers from the
spaghetti dish to be examined.

In the analysis, we considered all exposures related to the lunch on
14 Aug 2007. However, other food items available at the hotel apart
from the buffet, at the snack bar or elsewhere, were not accounted
for in our analysis. Recall bias is an important issue in
retrospective studies. In this case, the time between exposure and
interviews was around 15 days. Nonetheless, interviews focused on a
single meal for which the hotel provided a complete list of food
items. There was no pre-established hypothesis as to a specific
incriminated food item reducing the chances of information bias
either from the interviewers or the interviewees.

Selection bias relating to the low response rate cannot be excluded.
However, according to available information, 21 percent (56 out of
271) of potentially exposed people sought medical [attention] while
in Lloret the Mar, a percentage similar to that observed in our
sample, 24 percent (15 out of 61 interviewed people), thus ensuring
similar attack rates and probably increasing representativeness of
the sample.

Given the reduced sample size, we did not have the capacity to test
for small associations or potential interactions between risk factors.

Conclusion
----------
Although results of the investigation were not conclusive regarding
the source of contamination, they strongly suggest that a spaghetti
dish was the contamination vehicle. The alert was given in a timely
and efficient manner allowing for the rapid beginning of a
coordinated international investigation. A high level of
participation from implicated countries and Spanish Autonomous
Regions contributed to a timely investigation: results were available
4 days after notification to the Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia.
The low response rate to the questionnaire could have been reduced,
without generating biases in the results, by concentrating the
investigation efforts in most affected countries and regions also
limiting the time spent in coordination of the outbreak investigation.
