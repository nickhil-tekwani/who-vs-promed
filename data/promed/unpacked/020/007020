As many as 63 persons in Keezhakarai and surrounding villages in
Ramanathapuram district [Tamil Nadu] have been confirmed with
chikungunya [virus infection], deputy director of health Uma Maheswari
said on Wednesday [16 Sep 2009]. The results of blood tests of the
patients had been received from Virudhunagar Government Hospital and
it had been confirmed that they had chikungunya [virus infections],
she said.

Some of the patients got admitted into hospitals while several others
were not willing to come even to the government hospital despite
persuasion by the officials, she said. "As of now we cannot get the
exact number of people affected by the chikungunya [virus]," she said,
adding steps were being taken to prevent the spread of chikungunya
[virus].

Meanwhile, patients with symptoms of dengue fever also had been
admitted to some hospitals in the area, she added.

[Re that last sentence, the symptoms of chikungunya & dengue fevers
are very similar, so one wonders why they think some people have
dengue rather than chikungunya virus infection before the lab results
have come back. - Mod.JW.]

[Chikungunya virus transmission continues in Tamil Nadu state, first
reported recently from the interior of the state as suspected (see
ProMED-mail archive no. 20090914.3237) and now on the coast, where it
is laboratory confirmed.
