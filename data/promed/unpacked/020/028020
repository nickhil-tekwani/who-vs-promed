In Gorakhpur during the last 24 hours, 4 people succumbed to encephalitis
at Baba Raghav Das Medical College hospital [BRD MCH], taking the death
toll to 414 in the eastern region of Uttar Pradesh, a health official said
on Wednesday [13 Oct 2010]. Additional director (Health) UK Srivastav said
the dead include one each from Gorakhpur, Mahrajganj, Gonda, and Ballia
districts. A total of 34 new patients have been admitted to this hospital
during the same period, he said.

Of the total 414 deaths so far, 386 deaths occurred in BRD MCH while the
remaining were reported from other state-run hospitals of the region --
Gorakhpur, Basti, Deoria, Siddharthnagar, Kushinagar, and Maharajganj
districts. As many as 290 patients are presently undergoing treatment at
the BRD MCH and 19 in other government hospitals for the disease, he said.

[The number of fatalities continues to increase -- from 369 reported on 12
Oct 2010 to 414 just one day later (13 Oct 2010) in the current report. If
these reported figures and dates are accurate, the outbreak appears to be
accelerating. There is still no indication of identification of a specific
etiological agent responsible for the encephalitis cases.
