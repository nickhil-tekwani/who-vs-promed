Epidemiological summary

- Nigeria continues to report sporadic cases of monkeypox since September 2017;
- In the reporting month (November 2019), 8 new suspected monkeypox cases were reported from 5 states: Lagos (3), Rivers (3), and Oyo (1) [There are 3 states listed not 5, and the total number of cases adds to 7, not 8. Perhaps some information is missing. - Mod.TY];
- Only one of the suspected cases was confirmed positive for monkeypox in Oyo state;
- No death recorded in the reporting month;
- A total of 106 suspected cases have been reported so far in 2019, of which 44 were confirmed in 9 states (Bayelsa, Lagos, Delta, Rivers, Akwa Ibom, Enugu, Anambra, Cross River, and Oyo);
- One death was recorded in a case in Lagos state;
- Majority of confirmed cases (86%) are recorded in 4 states: Lagos (32%), Delta (23%), Rivers (16%), and Bayelsa (1%);
- The most-affected age group is 21-40 years with 80% of confirmed cases (range: 2-51years;
median age: 32.5 years);
- Males are more affected (male-to-female ratio = 2.7:1);
- From the beginning of the outbreak in September 2017 to November 2019, a total of 181 confirmed cases and 9 deaths have been recorded in 18 states (Rivers, Bayelsa, Cross River, Imo, Akwa Ibom, Lagos, Delta, Bauchi, FCT, Abia, Oyo, Enugu, Ekiti, Nasarawa, Benue, Plateau, Edo, Anambra).

[The sporadic monkeypox (MPX) cases are widely distributed in Nigeria, having occurred in 9 states over the past 2 years. With 9 deaths in 181 cases, the CFR (case fatality rate) is 5%. Nigeria has been a source of MPX cases that have been imported into other countries, most recently into the UK (see Monkeypox - UK: ex Nigeria 20191206.6827532) and previously in 2018.

There is no mention in the above report how many of the MPX cases were acquired from wildlife hosts or how many were due to contact with infected people. Prevention of MPX virus infections will not be possible without knowing the source of infection and locality where they occurred. The question remains about the source of these recent infections. Monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. Studies of prevalence of MPX virus in populations of rodent hosts are not mentioned in this or in previous reports. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. A vaccine that is expected to be effective against MPX has been developed recently, but deciding where to mount a campaign in this broad geographic area would be a challenge.

The MPX virus clade involved in these and previous cases is not mentioned. As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, the monkeypox virus clade in the Congo Basin causes more severe disease in humans -- with a case fatality rate of 11-17% -- than the clade in Ghana, which causes few fatalities. The reported case fatality rate in Nigeria is low. - Mod.TY
