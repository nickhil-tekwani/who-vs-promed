Over-sized dogs and [dogs] without photo identification in Beijing
are being snatched by the city police to curb the spread of rabies,
which has killed about 200 people a month in China this year.
Human rabies fatalities nationwide surged 30 percent to 1817 in the
first 9 months of 2006, according to the Chinese Center for Disease
Control and Prevention. At least 10 deaths occurred in the capital,
the official Xinhua news agency said this month, as attacks by
abandoned, rabid dogs escalate.
Police are killing strays before they can bite people, and ordering
owners to register their pets. Beginning 1 Nov 2006, owners without a
credit card-sized license bearing their pet's photo will face fines
of up to 5000 yuan (USD 635) and the confiscation of the animal.
Beijing authorities also introduced a one-dog per owner policy and is
enforcing a decade-old ban on "violent and large dogs," such as
German shepherds.
"There has been a significant rise in the number of human cases of
rabies particularly over the last 3 years in China," said Julie Hall,
the World Health Organization's team leader for communicable diseases
in Beijing. "This is something that requires action."
Police are stepping up enforcement as the rate of infection rises and
China is spending USD 34 billion in preparation for the 2008 Olympics
in Beijing. More than 8900 unregistered dogs were nabbed in the city
this year, Xinhua reported last month.
Dog-bite injuries in Beijing are increasing by about 10 000 a year,
and reached 70 000 in the first half, according to Xinhua. The trend
is similar in other cities.
Asia accounts for more than 80 percent of rabies cases worldwide,
according to a study by researchers in China and the U.K. published
in December in Emerging Infectious Diseases journal. In China, 103
200 people died of rabies in 4 epidemic waves between 1950 and 2004,
the study's authors said. Human cases are now approaching levels not
seen since the 1980s.
A "fifth epidemic wave of rabies that began in the 1990s is gaining
momentum," the authors said. Abandoned dogs bear much the blame, they
said.
"In China it is extortionately expensive to register an animal," the
WHO's Hall said. Pets are often kept illegally and unvaccinated, she
added, recommending that vaccination be compulsory and cheap.
Initial registration costs 1000 yuan (USD 127) and includes the 1st
rabies vaccination. The fee, including a booster shot, declines to
500 yuan in subsequent years.
In New York, by contrast, the annual registration costs USD 2.50 for
a dog that has been neutered or spayed, and USD 10.50 for others. A
rabies shot goes for about USD 10.
China has about 150 million pet dogs. The number has climbed 30
percent in the past 5 years, Euromonitor Plc said in a report last
year. The market research company attributes the increase to the
desire among one-child households for an extra companion and as a
source of comfort for older people.

[The concerns of the Chinese authorities in relation to
dog-transmitted rabies are in place, both from local public health
considerations as well as in view of the expected influx of visitors
during the 2008 Olympics, whose confidence in a safe stay should be
guaranteed.
On top of the enhancement of prescribed control and prevention
activities, described in the above and previous postings (see
references), there is room for improvement in surveillance and/or
transparency, as reflected from the data supplied to the WHO. At
present, the latest Chinese dog-rabies (incomplete) figures on WHO's
Rabnet date back to 1996; see
