Like the description of many zoonoses, the various reports of transmissible
spongiform encephalopathies in various host species I have read in
ProMED-mail and other newsgroups are plagued with the same problem. There
is confusion as to the need to distinguish between the variables "host
species", "infectious agent", and "disease" involved.
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is, by definition, only seen in bovine
species, not in sheep, humans, or any other host species. If the agent of
BSE in cattle jumps species, the disease (= unfortunate outcome of the
relationship between the host and the infectious agent), must have another
name.
To the casual observer, this may seem picky, but to an epidemiologist, this
results in utter confusion to properly report possible outbreaks, creating
a valid scientific database, and making sense of the situation so as to
properly address the situation.
How do specialists in the USDA distinguish between infection (inapparent or
disease) of sheep with the bovine agent of BSE and infection with the sheep
scrapie agent? Without a valid method to distinguish between the agents or
clinical disease in a specific host species, no conclusion can be made and
no sound action can be taken.
