In May 2013, symptoms of bacterial leaf streak were observed on rice plants at the panicle emergence stage in fields in Bubanza and Cibitoke provinces in Burundi. Laboratory analysis confirmed the presence of _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ [bacterial leaf streak] (EPPO A1 List) in diseased rice plants.

This is the 1st time that this bacterium is recorded in Burundi and surveys will be conducted to determine the extent of the disease

[Bacterial leaf streak (BLS) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_. So far, it had been reported only from Australasia, West Africa, and Madagascar, with yield losses of up to 30 per cent. The bacteria can also affect a number of grasses which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include translucent interveinal streaks extending into orange lesions which may kill the leaf. Yellowish bacterial exudates may be seen. Bacteria can enter through small wounds on the leaf surface, including insect damage. Plants are susceptible at all stages, but infection is most damaging at the tillering stage. BLS is more prevalent in the rainy season.

The pathogen survives between seasons on volunteer rice plants, leaf debris, and infected stubble. It is seed borne and can also be spread with infected plant and other materials, by water and mechanical means (including human and insect activity). Disease management is difficult and may include phytosanitation (control of reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilisers), bacteriocides (such as copper compounds) and use of resistant crop varieties.

The detection of BLS in central Africa is of concern for the region. In the reference given above it is stated that diagnostic sequences identified in the Burundi isolate were identical to several Asian strains and a strain from Mali in West Africa. The bacteria may have entered the region with contaminated seed from those areas, however, a source of the outbreak remains to be verified.

Another strain of the pathogen (_X. oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_) causes bacterial leaf blight (BLB). Symptoms are similar but BLB is generally considered more invasive.
