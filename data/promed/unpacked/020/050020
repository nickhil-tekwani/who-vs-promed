Indonesia: Avian Influenza Situation in Indonesia, As of 14 Jan 2006
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed an additional case
of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The case
occurred in a 29-year-old woman who worked as a midwife at the
maternity ward in a Jakarta hospital. She developed symptoms on 31
Dec 2005, was hospitalized on 2 Jan 2006, and died on 11 Jan 2006.
Investigations conducted by the Ministry of Health and WHO found
evidence of poultry deaths in her neighbourhood in the 2 weeks prior
to onset of illness. Other findings indicate that the patient visited
a live bird market to select and purchase freshly slaughtered chicken
in the days immediately prior to symptom onset. Investigations at
these sites are continuing.
The possibility that the patient acquired her infection from an
occupational exposure is considered unlikely. Investigations
conducted today reveal that none of her co-workers was ill prior to
the start of her illness. According to hospital records, no patients
in the ward where she worked showed signs of influenza-like illness
while hospitalized.
Contact tracing has been extensive for this case, as the woman worked
2 shifts at the hospital at the time of symptom onset. At this stage,
there is no evidence that she transmitted the infection to any
patients under her care or to colleagues at the hospital. Similarly,
there are no signs of illness in family members or neighbours. Health
monitoring of contacts will continue until the maximum incubation
period has ended.
The newly confirmed case is the 17th in Indonesia and the 12th fatality.
