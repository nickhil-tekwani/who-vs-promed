For some operators, the winter [2020/21] season that is approaching is "looking bleak, especially when it comes to tomatoes, as ToBRFV is spreading very quickly," reports Cooperativa Alba Bio, Ragusa [province].

"The official sighting of the virus in Sicily dates back to January 2019 and, since then, it has spread with incredible speed especially in the Ragusa and Syracuse provinces. The consequences of the virus inside greenhouses are very worrying: a tomato plant presenting symptoms of the disease in question can infect up to 90% of the crop in just a few months.

But there is more, as we have registered New Delhi [_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_, see comments below] attacks on zucchini plants [ProMED posts 20160327.4121164 and 20180319.5697141], which are causing considerable losses for open-field producers."

[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of the genus _Tobamovirus_ (type member _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan after a new disease of glasshouse tomatoes occurred there in 2015. Since then, it is also being reported from other regions and was shown to affect also capsicum crops. It is spreading in Europe and has been added to the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO). ToBRFV symptoms on tomato vary depending on host cultivar, but they may include chlorosis, mottling, mosaic and crinkling (rugosis) on leaves; necrotic spots on petioles and calyces; yellowish mottling, brown spots and rugosis on fruit, making them unmarketable. On capsicum, leaf symptoms are similar; fruits may be deformed with yellow mottling or green stripes. Almost 100 percent incidence was reported for some outbreaks in tomato, but not every fruit on an infected plant may show symptoms.

ToBRFV (like many tobamoviruses) is seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means, contaminated equipment, as well as with plant or other materials. It is very stable and can remain infectious for months outside a host. Recently, bumblebees, which are used widely as commercial pollinators in glasshouse tomato production, have been shown to be effective vectors of ToBRFV (see link below). Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species are likely pathogen reservoirs. The Tm-22 resistance gene used in some tomato cultivars to protect from other tobamoviruses (such as _Tomato mosaic virus_) does not appear to be effective against ToBRFV. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of virus reservoirs. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (for example, ProMED post 20140122.2222560).

Coinfection of ToBRFV with _Pepino mosaic virus_ (genus _Potexvirus_) and _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (genus _Orthotospovirus_) have been found (ProMED posts 20191029.6751082, 20200507.7307615). It is thought that the observed symptoms on tomatoes may be due to either virus or to synergism. Further research is needed to clarify a potential role of ToBRFV in coinfections and to whether its presence in coinfections may have led to earlier cases of misdiagnosis and delayed identification of this new virus.

_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (genus _Begomovirus_) was reported from Italy for the first time in 2016 (ProMED post 20160327.4121164) on cucurbits in Sicily. For more information on this virus see previous ProMED posts in the archives.
