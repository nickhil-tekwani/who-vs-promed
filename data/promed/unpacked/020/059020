European Union commissioner proposes new mad cow measures
---------------------------------------------
BRUSSELS, Belgium: The European Union's consumer protection and health
chief unveiled new proposals on Tuesday to deal with the mad cow crisis,
including lowering the minimum testing age for cattle to 24 months and
testing sheep. EU commissioner David Byrne also proposed halting the
automatic slaughter of entire herds [in which cases of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) are uncovered. Addressing an EU meeting of the 15 farm
ministers, Byrne said the moves were necessary transition measures ahead of
the adoption on 1 July of the new EU regulation on transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy (TSE) diseases, including BSE and scrapie, which affects sheep.
Byrne also wants to extend the current EU ban on the use of meat and bone
meal in animal feed -- blamed largely for the two major outbreaks of BSE
that have swept across the EU -- and introduce stricter controls on imports
of animal feed from non-EU countries where "potential weaknesses" currently
exist. Testing for TSEs will focus on healthy slaughtered animals and
animals that die on the farm.
The EU has struggled to deal with a health crisis that has undermined
consumer confidence and underscored the need for more adequate controls and
test methods. Since an intensive BSE testing program began in all EU member
states on 1 Jan 2001, 75 cases of the disease have been uncovered among the
1.75 million tests carried out on healthy animals before slaughter. More
than 80 cases of BSE have been diagnosed as a result of testing dead, sick,
or injured animals.
Byrne said good veterinary surveillance was the single most important
method of detecting BSE, and chided several member states for a lack of
proper controls. While backing the lowering of the testing age for BSE in
sick, injured, or dead animals to 24 months, Byrne said he would favor a
reduction in the current 30 month old testing age to 18 months, or even 12
months, if it helped boost consumer confidence.
The Italian health ministry on Tuesday confirmed its 15th case of mad cow
disease since the EU imposed mandatory testing.

New cases of mad cow disease detected in France
--------------------------------------------------
PARIS, May 15, 2001: The French Ministry of Agriculture Tuesday confirmed 2
new cases of mad cow disease in the provinces of La Manche and Rhone.
France has registered 317 animals with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
since 1991, of which 75 have been detected since the beginning of this
year, according to the Ministry.

PARIS: A report on the handling of risk factors in the outbreak of mad cow
disease lambasts France's Agriculture Ministry for dragging its feet in
forbidding meat-based animal feed and keeping quiet about suspicions. The
report by a Senate commission, released Thursday, predicts that France will
see 300 cases of what is thought to be the human form of the disease in the
next 60 years, a length of time that accounts for the decades-long
incubation period of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). So far, 3
people have died [of vCJD in France. "The risk is now behind us, even if
the consequences lie ahead," said the 362 page report, released after a 6
month investigation.
Interministerial reports from 1994-2000 "show that the Agriculture Ministry
constantly tried to hinder or delay precautionary measures, which later
proved to be security measures, under the motive that they had no
scientific bases," the report said. Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany
denounced the report as "completely false" and said it amounted to a
"political maneuver."
Among the evidence, the report cites an official in the Agriculture
Ministry, Regis Lesueur, saying that "some partial information" showed as
early as 1994 a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and
the human brain-wasting illness. The report says that there was sufficient
reason before 1996 to ban livestock feed made from animal carcasses that
could carry the malady. Animal feed made from meat and bone was banned for
cows in 1990, but not for pigs and sheep, the report points out. Mix-ups
could have occurred in factories, in trucks, or at farms where both types
of animals are raised, the report suggested. Such "cross contamination
seems to constitute the most plausible explanation of the second phase of
bovine contamination," after 1996, the report said.
The commission has all but dismissed claims that mad cow disease continued
propagating in France because of the illicit importing from Britain of
banned feed. A National Assembly commission is to release a report on the
issue in June.

[It should be noted that the United Kingdom's Ministry of Agriculture
Fisheries and Food suffered similar embarrassment when it was found that,
in spite of government regulations, cross-contamination and usages
continued. This was reported a number of years before the French government
implemented similar restrictions. There was adequate warning.
Coincidentally, the EU has released the report on organic fertilizers
derived from ruminant animals: Opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee:

BSE crisis talks over risk from cattle cull
-------------------------------------------
Ministers have summoned their top scientific advisers to an emergency
meeting, as fears mount that ash and the buried carcasses of cows
slaughtered during the epidemic of foot and mouth disease (FMD) could be
spreading the human version of BSE. On Thursday new evidence from tests at
hundreds of sites where cattle have been burnt or buried will be reviewed
by experts. Ministers are concerned that proteins known as "prions", which
cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and are found in BSE-infected
meat, may have polluted the water supply or the air. The hastily convened
meeting shows the depth of ministers' concern.
Members of the committee have confirmed to The Observer that the mass
slaughter programme posed a risk of infection from prions. "There is
certainly a risk, but we do not know how big or small it is," said
Professor Harriet Kimbell. Another committee member, veterinary surgeon
Peter Jinman, said he had been called early last week and told of the
meeting "specifically to look at this issue of possible contamination".
The problem lies with cows that are older than 30 months and may have
developed BSE. Though enormous efforts have been made to stamp out the
disease in Britain, experts believe that nearly 2 per cent of cattle are
still infected. Usually special rules govern the disposal of cattle
carcasses, but during the FMD epidemic whole herds were slaughtered and
disposed of without testing.
Environmental health officials in Devon, one of the areas hardest hit by
FMD, told The Observer that in many instances piles of ash remain unburied.
In some cases the ash has lain exposed for up to 3 months. That raises the
risk of prions being blown away on the wind or washed into local streams
and rivers . Nicholas Mann, a senior commercial services manager for
Torridge District Council, said there were up to 40 ash pyres in his
district alone. Adverts in local newspapers have been placed asking
residents within two kilometers of a pyre to come forward to have their
water supplies tested for ash contamination. Aside from prions, other
possible contaminations include bacteria such as _Escherichia coli_ and
campylobacter, which are harmful to humans.
A spokesman from the Environment Agency said that routine tests were
continuing. She said that all ash was disposed of after assessment of
potential health and environmental risks.

The [UK government is paying GBP 40 million [USD 56 million a year to
store remains of cows slaughtered because of the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) crisis. About 400 000 tons of animal waste, boiled and
ground to dust, is being kept at 15 sites around the country because of a
shortage of incinerators. Piled in warehouses, much of the waste dates from
the beginning of the BSE slaughter programme 5 years ago.
Details of how much money is being paid to keep the remains have not been
revealed, [but a worker in the waste industry told The Telegraph that some
firms were earning up to GBP 250 [USD 354 per square foot a day for
storing meat and bonemeal. He said: "If they were storing non-hazardous
waste, they might expect about GBP 1.50 [USD 2.12 per square foot a day
for storing it. "This BSE mountain is growing. It is stored in ordinary
warehouses and there could even be a threat to public health." he said. The
animal waste is a consequence of the policy of slaughtering an estimated
3.5 million cattle aged over 30 months in an attempt to eradicate BSE.
The meat and bonemeal has to be incinerated at temperatures of 1830 degrees
F (1000 degrees C) to destroy BSE proteins that could enter the food chain.
Because there are only 3 suitable incinerators, however, the stockpiles are
growing. There are 9 storage sites in England: Preston and Longton in
Lancashire, Widnes in Cheshire, Prescot in Merseyside, Blyton and Barton
Heath in Lincolnshire, Greendale Barton and Wrangaton in Devon, and
Wymington in Bedfordshire. There are 2 in Scotland: Glenrothes in Fife and
Bonnington in Borders; and 4 in Northern Ireland: Castledawson in Co
Londonderry, Strabane in Co Tyrone, and Maghaberry and Mallusk in Co Antrim.
Storage costs are paid by the Government out of funds for dealing with the
BSE crisis. The Intervention Board, a Government department that deals with
European Union agriculture policy, is overseeing the slaughter, storage,
and incineration programme. A spokesman for the board said that the waste
was being incinerated but the cattle-over-30-month slaughter scheme had
been suspended because of the foot and mouth disease crisis. "We have got a
target to incinerate 60 per cent by 2002. In the winter months we were
slaughtering something like 15 000 cattle a week on average."
Figures from the board showed that the cost of storage and transport of
meat, bonemeal, and tallow between May 1996 and November 2000 was GBP 178
million [USD 252 million, almost GBP 40 million [USD 56 million a year.
The spokesman refused to comment on the fees being paid to storage
companies saying: "We negotiate contracts with various companies. They are
commercially sensitive prices."

Thousands of cattle and sheep were slaughtered and then burned or buried as
agriculture officials in the [Irish Republic, Northern Ireland, and
Britain struggled to restrict the spread of foot and mouth disease (FMD).
Farming areas and workers were afflicted, and tourism suffered a major blow
as holidaymakers steered clear of Ireland and Britain. It was suggested
that the burning mounds were causing more pollution in Britain than all its
industrial stacks.
Now a company based in Clydebank, Scotland believes it can help [to limit
the damage done to our environment by pyres of FMD or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE)-infected livestock. In recent week, Ken Stuart of
Waste Reduction Europe Ltd (WRE) visited Northern Ireland to discuss new
technology with agriculture and environment officials which would eradicate
the pathogens in cattle diagnosed with BSE.
WRE has developed a tissue digestor, [which eliminates the need for
incineration and the release of potentially dangerous pollutants and
[infectious agents. The digestor works like a pressure cooker. It operates
at 150 degrees Celsius, and converts animal tissues into an aqueous
solution which, the company claims, can be "safely disposed of in a sewer".
The process uses alkaline hydrolysis at an elevated temperature to convert
the proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids of all cells and tissues, as well
as the infectious microorganisms, to a sterile solution. The manufacturer
argues that, unlike incinerators or pyres, their "environmentally
responsible" process releases no emission to the atmosphere, operates at a
fraction of the cost, destroys all pathogens, and reduces the volume of the
carcass by up to 98 per cent.
Researchers have discovered that traces of prions -- proteins responsible
for BSE -- could survive the incineration process, leaving an end product
that remains a biohazard. Ken Stuart said that the WRE digestors were
already being used on a trial basis in England and Scotland and that the
company is currently awaiting legislation to go through the EU system and
allow full time use of its technology. WRE is a subsidiary of a giant waste
reduction company in the United States. The digestor system was invented by
2 US academics who were trying to find ways of disposing of radioactive
laboratory mice. Mr Stuart said the US government had already approved the
system and a number of digestors currently operated in veterinary and
medical schools and universities.
