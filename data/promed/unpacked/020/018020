Upon investigation into reports of workers at Upstate Shredding's
Route 38 Owego, New York, facility contracting Legionnaires' disease,
it was confirmed on Monday [22 Aug 2011] that 5 workers were diagnosed
with the disease, and that measures have been put in place to avoid
future outbreaks.

According to Johannes Peeters, from Tioga County [New York State]
Environmental Health, there have been 5 confirmed cases of the disease
since 2009. But Peeters also noted that only the employees working at
the shredder were at risk, and that there have been protective
measures put in place to eliminate any future outbreaks. "The only
concern for this is for the people working directly at that location,"
said Peeters.

And the officials at the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) out of West Virginia agreed. Rachel L. Bailey, a
Public Health Service Medical Officer for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention at NIOSH, also confirmed the 5 known cases of
Legionnaires' disease. Bailey also further explained what might have
led to the outbreak at the plant.

"Water is used during the shredding process," she stated. She
continued, "When the shredder is operating, municipal water is pumped
into the shredding chamber through pipes fitted to each side of the
shredder head to provide cooling and lubrication. The interior of the
shredding chamber can reach 500 deg F and much of the water evaporates
during the shredding operation; however, the shredded material that
exits the shredder remains wet as it proceeds on the conveyor system
to be separated into ferrous and non-ferrous portions."

During a 1 and 2 Jun 2011 site visit made by NIOSH to the Owego
facility, which was requested by owner Adam Weitsman in May of 2011,
representatives observed multiple pools of standing/stagnant water
around the facility. Bailey noted that stagnant water is an ideal
environment for _Legionella_ growth if heated such as by sunlight.

Water samples were taken from several pools of standing water, and the
laboratory identified _Legionella_ bacteria in all those samples. They
also noted that _Legionella_ was also identified in water dripping
from the shredder onto the exit conveyor belt that contains the
shredded material as well as in a swab sample taken from a conveyor
belt in the picking shed at the facility. A NIOSH report, dated 22 Jul
2011, confirmed that all the workers who were diagnosed with
Legionnaires' disease worked in or around standing water and/or
performed picking activities that involve manually removing copper and
other materials observed passing on a moving conveyor. But standing
water, according to Bailey, is the culprit in this case.

The July report also noted that the workers that contracted the
illness prior to the testing at the facility, were subsequently tested
for Legionnaires' disease. Each test, according to Bailey, came out
positive.

With their interim letter and report sent to Adam Weitsman in July,
NIOSH made recommendations for the facility -- recommendations that
Weitsman has since put in place. The report recommended that all
standing water be eliminated in the facility, that grading be done
around the grounds to eliminate standing water, that workers in the
specific areas where the _Legionella_ bacteria was confirmed wear
protective respirators, and that conveyors and the immediate area
surrounding them be disinfected with a chlorine mixture.

In an interview with Weitsman on Wednesday [24 Aug 2011], he stated
that he was working with these agencies to correct the problem. "We
had a case awhile ago," said Weitsman, "and we thought it was the
flu." Weitsman grew concerned when others became ill, and that is when
he requested that NIOSH come in and examine things. According to
Peeters from Environmental Health, Weitsman was concerned, and he was
the one who made the call. Weitsman also talked of things he has put
in place since the discovery of the _Legionella_ bacteria within the
plant. A recent purchase of a USD 21 million shredder that utilizes 10
percent of the water that the old shredder utilized, according to
Weitsman, will help out tremendously. "The old shredder was 15 years
old," said Weitsman. "The water could have been sitting in there for a
very long time."

Weitsman has also hired a former official from the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) to serve as his safety coordinator,
and has enforced the wearing of protective respirators by employees
working in the specific area. Weitsman also noted that they have
started grading to eliminate pools of standing water. The last
confirmed case of Legionnaires' Disease at the site, according to
NIOSH, was in mid-July, and followed their visit. The precautionary
recommendations to Weitsman were implemented shortly after.

NIOSH also noted that there is no risk of the _Legionella_ bacteria
becoming airborne and spreading into the community as they do not
utilize cooling towers. According to Bailey, if _Legionella_ is spread
through cooling towers, it can travel as far as 3.7 miles away, as was
documented in an epidemic of Legionnaires' disease that took place in
Pas-de-Calais in northern France in 2003-2004.

Legionnaires' disease is an infection of the lungs and is a form of
pneumonia; it is caused by a type of bacteria called _Legionella_. The
_Legionella_ bacteria are found naturally in the environment, usually
in warm, watery environments. It can also be found in soil. People get
Legionnaires' disease when they breathe in a mist or vapor (small
droplets of water in the air) that has been contaminated with the
bacteria. Legionnaires' disease can be very serious and can cause
death in up to 5 percent to 30 percent of people with the disease. It
is treated with antibiotics.

The sooner antibiotic therapy is started, the less likely the chance
of serious complications or death. Depending on the severity of
symptoms, the person may need to be admitted to the hospital and given
intravenous fluids and oxygen. To learn more about the disease and its
risks, visit http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/patient_facts.htm.
