Health officials in Ireland are investigating an _E. coli_ O26 outbreak at a childcare facility. Officials with the Department of Public Health Mid-West of the Health Service Executive (HSE) said the agency is managing the outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ (or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC) and highlighted the importance of effective hand hygiene and well water treatment. The agency added that there are fewer than 5 patients at the childcare facility in Limerick and the incident is under control.

EHEC, also known as verotoxigenic _E. coli_ (VTEC), can cause serious illness in children under 5 and the elderly. The serious outcomes of illness [show] the importance of hand hygiene before and after preparing food and after contact with farm animals and their environment, said officials.

Ireland has one of the highest rates of EHEC in Europe, and the Midwest region has one of the top rates in the country. In the Midwest, there were 128 cases in 2018, 130 in 2019, 117 in 2020, and 79 so far in 2021. Earlier in 2021, another _E. coli_ O26 outbreak among young children affected one setting in a region that includes Limerick. The most common ways to be infected are through contact with farm animals, swimming in streams and lakes, drinking untreated water from private wells, person-to-person contact in childcare centers or households with children under 5 years old, and through food and drinks contaminated with microscopic amounts of fecal matter.

Rose Fitzgerald, specialist in public health medicine, said infections and outbreaks are more common during summer. "We are asking the public to be conscious of their activities throughout the summer period, particularly in relation to hand hygiene, drinking treated water, swimming in potentially contaminated fresh waters, and being on farms," she said. "It is a serious disease that can cause life-changing illness, and while it can last in the system for as short as a week, it can sometimes take several months to clear the infection. Anyone who is infected or is a close contact of a case requires clearance from a public health doctor to attend healthcare, childcare or work that involves food-handling."

[Enteric infections including EHEC can spread easily in the childcare setting. Infections with _E. coli_ that produce Shiga toxin, the prototypic strain being O157:H7, can result in bloody, usually non-febrile, diarrhea that may progress to kidney failure and breakdown of red blood cells related to the toxin's effect on the kidney. The use of antibacterials in the early stages of the infection can increase the risk of complications, especially hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Evaluation of asymptomatic children in the setting of an EHEC outbreak in the daycare setting can be an important part of control:

Abstract
--------
"Objectives: Control measures for enteric outbreaks in childcare settings frequently include screening by stool cultures from symptomatic children only. We present evidence from an investigation of _Escherichia coli_ (_E. coli_) O157:H7 in a daycare in Waterloo, Ontario to support implementation of a mandatory screening policy for all children during an outbreak.

"Methods: In addition to routine outbreak control measures employed by the health unit, stool samples from all children and staff were collected, with positive _E. coli_ cultures typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We conducted a cohort study, using data from the environmental investigation and questionnaires administered to parents and staff, to look for risk factors for infection and to survey parent/staff knowledge regarding appropriate management of diarrhea.

"Results: Overall 11 _E. coli_ O157:H7 cases were identified (7 lab-confirmed); 9 were children. No common source of infection was identified. Factors identified as possibly contributing to person-to-person transmission within the daycare included: i) the underreporting and possible attendance of symptomatic children despite alerting parents to the outbreak and requirements to keep symptomatic children at home, ii) possible transmission from an asymptomatic infected child, and iii) inconsistent understanding among parents and staff regarding diarrhea and appropriate management of a child with diarrhea.

"Discussion: This investigation reveals that in childcare settings, _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak screening policies based on reported symptoms only may be insufficient. We recommend that such policies be amended to include the collection of at least one stool culture from all children in attendance, regardless of symptom history."
