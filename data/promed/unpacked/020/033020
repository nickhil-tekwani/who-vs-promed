If you're heading into the woods this summer [2014], it's time to take Lyme disease seriously. Cases of the illness continue to rise in southern Quebec; in the Monteregie alone, cases have grown 4-fold in the last few years.

A St. Lazare resident knows the story well. She and her family headed out on a day trip a few weeks ago and woke up the next day with a burning a sensation on her leg. "I kept rubbing and thinking it was a mole that was just raised and was bothering me, so I kept rubbing and rubbing," said [the St. Lazare resident]. "Then eventually, when I went to the washroom and I actually looked down, I saw little legs sticking out." Those legs belonged to a tick. [The St. Lazare resident's] husband pulled the tick out with a pair of tweezers, but within a few days she was developing a rash with the characteristic of Lyme disease. "(The rash) was almost as big as my fist. It was red, and it was starting to show the bulls-eye pattern that they look for," she said.

Early symptoms include fever, headache, dizziness and the tell-tale rash. If left untreated, symptoms can last months to years and include recurring arthritis, nervous system and/or neurological problems, numbness and/or paralysis. Although not common, fatalities from Lyme disease have been reported.

Ticks are small, ranging in size from a poppy seed to a pea, the Public Health Agency of Canada noted. The size of the tick varies depending on its age and whether it has fed recently.

[The St. Lazare resident] believes she picked up the tick just across the Ontario border and carried it back home to Quebec.

1st identified in the USA, Lyme disease has been on a steady increase since it was 1st reported here [Canada] in 2006. Last year [2013], 142 cases of Lyme disease were reported in the province. Half -- 76 total -- were in the Monteregie. "It's just the progression because of the climatic change. It's crossing the border," said Dr. Alain Poirier, director of Monteregie Public Health.

Still, some Quebecers and even doctors may not be as aware of it, he said. In an effort to spread awareness, the Monteregie Health Agency has been working to share information with local health professionals. "For doctors, we have specific tools to teach them about specific information, prevention and treatment," said Poirier. The goal is for health professionals across the province to now recognize and report cases. "There's a campaign of information going on right now so that people would be much [more] informed than they have been in the past," said Dr. Richard Masse, director of Montreal Public Health.

[The St. Lazare resident] said, however, she has heard of some people being told by their doctors not to worry about tick bites. "They were (saying), "No, Lyme disease doesn't exist in Quebec. Just go home," she said, adding that she elected to go to a hospital in Alexandria, Ontario just across the border, where a doctor prescribed antibiotics. "They don't take any chances," said [the St. Lazare resident]. "As soon as they see the redness, they will give you the antibiotic right away." [She] has felt fine since and urges others to watch for ticks and seek treatment if they're suspected of contracting the illness.

[Quebec is a province in eastern Canada. Monteregie, with a population of 1 442 433 (2011), is an administrative region in southern Quebec. It is located mostly along the southern shore of the St. Lawrence River, between the city of Montreal and the New York State border (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monteregie). The city of St. Lazare, where the _B. burgdorferi_-infected patient mentioned in the news article above resided, is a suburb west of Montreal, located in the portion of Monteregie that borders Ontario, north of the St. Lawrence River. Saint-Lazare has experienced rapid growth since 1990 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Lazare,_Quebec). Monteregie can be found on a map of the subdivisions of Quebec at: http://www.quebec511.info/en/carte_routiere/.

In the USA, the prevalence of _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks commonly ranges between 20 and 40 percent in New England, the Mid-Atlantic States, and Minnesota and Wisconsin, where Lyme disease is endemic (Wormser GP, Dattwyler RJ, Shapiro ED, et al: The clinical assessment, treatment, and prevention of Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis: clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Clin Infect Dis. (2006) 43 (9): 1089-1134. doi: 10.1086/508667. Available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full). Prevalence of infected ticks has been found to be almost 30 to over 50 percent in southern counties of New York State (http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0099348#pone-0099348-g001 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2883481/).

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends in regions where the local rate of _B. burgdorferi_ infection in _Ixodes_ ticks is at least 20 percent that antibiotic prophylaxis be given for prevention of Lyme disease after a recognized tick bite, if (a) the attached tick can be reliably identified as an adult or nymphal _I. scapularis_ tick that is estimated to have been attached for 36 hours or longer on the basis of the degree of engorgement of the tick with blood or of certainty about the time of exposure to the tick, (b) prophylaxis can be started within 72 hours of the time that the tick was removed, and (c) there is not contraindication for the antibiotic. A single dose of doxycycline is recommended for adults (200 mg dose) and children at least 8 years of age (4 mg/kg up to a maximum dose of 200 mg).

The prevalence of infected ticks in St. Lazare, Monteregie is not mentioned in the news report above, but the prevalence of infected ticks in southern Ontario just west of the head of the St Lawrence River, about 350 km (217 miles) southwest of St Lazare, was reported in a recent ProMED-mail post (Lyme disease - Canada (02): (ON) _B. burgdorferi_ prevalence in ticks 20140509.2461398) to have risen to 15 percent in 2013, just below the 20 percent threshold. In any case, the St. Lazare resident said she believes she picked up the tick just across the border in Ontario.

Factors that could account for a true increase in disease incidence include climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods like St. Lazare into surrounding wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, white-footed mice and other small rodents, and _Borrelia burgdorferi_-infected nymphal _Ixodes scapularis_. Deer, although not susceptible to Lyme disease, supply the adult tick with a required blood meal; white-footed mice and other small rodents are the primary reservoirs for the Lyme disease bacillus; and nymphal _I. scapularis_ are the primary tick vectors for Lyme disease in the northeastern US and southeastern Canada. - Mod.ML
