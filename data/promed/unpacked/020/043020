vaccination, RFI 20110125.0304]
------------------------------------------------------
In South Africa, Rift Valley fever [RVF] is a notifiable disease and
not a controlled disease. This means that the State Veterinary
Services are not solely responsible for the control of the disease.
The government assists farmers with the supply of vaccine and promotes
the vaccination of South African livestock, but the responsibility
lies with the farmer. Vaccine is cheap and readily available to
farmers. The result is that when reporting an outbreak, the State
Veterinary Services do not have any statistics with regard to the
number of animals vaccinated, as the numbers vaccinated by farmers and
private veterinarians far exceed the numbers vaccinated by the state.
The OIE's WAHID disease reporting system does not allow for this
scenario and if vaccination is recorded on the system as a control
measure, details must be given which the state does not have.

South African Veterinary Services, by means of the Provincial
Veterinary Services do vaccinate in response to outbreaks, but the
effect of media campaigns like the one mentioned in the ProMED-mail
RFI [referenced above] has a much greater effect on the numbers of
animals vaccinated. There is no "no vaccination" policy in South
Africa with regards to the control of Rift Valley fever, this was a
miscommunication caused by the OIE WAHIS [World Animal Health
Information System]. South Africa cannot officially report vaccination
numbers as it is not a legal requirement to report RVF vaccinations to
the State.

[The response above, for which ProMED-mail is very grateful to Dr
Ntshabele, sets the matter clear: there is no "no vaccination" policy
in South Africa with regard to the control of RVF.

The following information on RVF control in South Africa is currently
listed in WAHID interface (South Africa 2009 annual report, submitted
4 May 2010), referring to the relevant domestic animals, namely
cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, and camelids:
1. Notifiable disease (symbol *);
2. Precautions at the border (symbol Qf);
3. General surveillance (symbol GSu);
4. Control of arthropods (symbol Cn).

See
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=report_ann_sem&country=ZAF&year=2009&semester=0&aquatic=2&WAHID=1>.

Vaccination is also not mentioned among South Africa's WAHID-listed
control measures of other OIE-notifiable diseases such as bluetongue,
African horse sickness, lumpy skin disease, and Newcastle disease. -
