[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[4] Iran: 148 950 total cases, 7734 deaths
Date: Sat 30 May 2020
Source: Radio Farda [edited]

Iran has completely lifted all coronavirus restrictions across the country while, according to health officials, infections still remain high at more than 2000 new cases every day.

Speaking at a meeting of the National Coronavirus Combat Taskforce on Saturday [30 May 2020], President Hassan Rouhani said mosques have opened for prayers throughout the country; restrictions on the opening hours of shopping centers and malls, which had to close at 6:00 pm, have been lifted; and government employees are back to work now.

Meanwhile, the number of newly identified cases of COVID-19 that dropped to below 2000 in April 2020 has risen again. According to the latest official statement on Fri 29 May 2020, 2282 new cases were identified in the last 24-hour reporting period. The previous day, there were more than 2800 infections; the highest since 2 Apr 2020. The highest number of new cases, 3111, was reported on 31 Mar 2020.

The number of COVID-19 deaths announced on Friday [29 May 2020] was 57. The highest number of coronavirus deaths in Iran in one day, 157, was registered on 5 Apr 2020.

The Health Ministry Spokesman Dr. Kianoush Jahanpur on Sat 30 May 2020 said the total number of COVID-19 cases and the death toll in the country have, respectively, risen to 148 950 and 7734. So far, 915 998 coronavirus tests have been done, he said. Iran is the worst-affected country in the Middle East.

Dr. Jahanpur also pointed out that the southwestern province of Khuzestan is still considered a "red zone" due to the higher number of infections and deaths, and the situation in several other provinces -- including East and West Azarbaijan, Lorestan, Kordestan and Kermanshah in the west of the country, the central province of Esfahan, and the southern provinces of Hormozgan -- is still alarming.

The health ministry has divided the country into white, yellow and red zones on the basis of the number of cases of COVID-19 infections and deaths.

Iran's economy, already under the burden of US sanctions that were re-introduced by President Donald Trump, has also been hit hard by the pandemic. According to President Rouhani, the service sector has experienced the worst among all sectors of the economy since the outbreak in February 2020.

Speaking at a ceremony held by the Information and Communication Technology Ministry to unveil new projects on 28 May 2020, Rouhani urged investment in digital economy, particularly in view of the coronavirus pandemic. The digital economy only makes up 6.5 percent of the Iranian economy, while in some countries it is as big as 14 percent, Rouhani said.

President Rouhani stressed that people must believe that "going back to normal" is not possible in the short term, and they need to consider the changed lifestyle for years to come. "A new wave [of the pandemic] is possible if people do not take notice of health warnings," he said.

In a program on the state-run television, the Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi said the observance of social distancing rules by people has dropped from 90 percent to 40 percent. According to Harirchi, the number of those who will stay home for the fear of the virus has also dropped from 80 percent to 32 percent now.

In the capital Tehran, Deputy Mayor Manaf Hashemi has said that tougher measures will be implemented about wearing masks. "Those who are not wearing masks will not be allowed to enter underground stations," he said.

COVID-19 update 121 [data as of 30 May 2020 12:00 CET]
-------------------------------------
[These data are changing daily and are hard to reconcile with data from previous dates. - Mod.UBA]

Situation in Spain:
After combining the data from both surveillance methods, in Spain, at present a total of 239 228 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 27 125 deaths have been reported to date (Table 1, Table 2, Figure 1, and Figure 2) [286 308 - Worldometer accessed at 30 May 18:38 GMT].

[Given the recent changes in disease reporting by Spain, it is difficult to draw trend comparisons at this time. Only to rehash, according to the 30 May 2020 report, there were 271 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the confirmed cumulative total to 239 228, a 24-hour increase from the 187 reported on 29 May 2020, (The difference between the total case numbers for 29 and 30 May 2020 is higher, so it is presumed that case numbers may have been adjusted). A total of 27 125 deaths are reported as of 30 May 2020, only 4 more deaths than reported on 29 May 2020.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 14.65 (down from 29 May 2020, when it was 14.79), against a continual slow decrease over the past 30 days.

Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times.

In terms of absolute numbers of cases, Madrid has 68 740 cases followed by Catalonia at 59 003, Castile and Leon at 18 804, Castile-La Mancha at 17 184, and Basque Country at 13 506. In terms of population-based rates (per 100 000 population) over the preceding 14-day period, Catalonia is 1st with 39.74 followed by Castile and Leon at 23.67, Madrid with 23.52, Castile-La Mancha at 20.37 and Navarre at 19.87.

According to Table 2, of the 239 228 cases, an additional 287 cases have been hospitalized over the preceding 7 days, and an additional 10 cases were admitted to ICUs over the past 7 days. Overall, 9.2% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICUs.
