Saturday's [25 Dec 2021] tally marked the 3rd consecutive day that numbers have reached record highs and comes amid concern over the rapid spread of the omicron variant. France reported a record high of 104 611 COVID-19 infections on [Sat 25 Dec 2021] breaking the 100 000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began.

These data come ahead of a video-conference meeting [Mon 27 Dec 2021] in which President Emmanuel Macron and key members of his government will discuss new COVID-19 safety measures. Officials are concerned about the effect of the rapid spread of the omicron variant.

On [Fri 24 Dec 2021] the health authority recommended adults receive a booster jab 3 months after their initial vaccination. Now the government is moving to make the health pass issued to the vaccinated valid only if people accept the booster jab. The pass is required for access to cafés, restaurants, and public spaces, as well as for international travel.

Some regions have already enacted their own safety measures. At the end of last month [November 2021], for example, officials in Savoie, a department in the south east of France, reintroduced the compulsory wearing of masks, not just in indoor public spaces, but outdoors too -- a move just adopted in neighbouring Italy.

The latest figures mark a dramatic rise since the beginning of [December 2021]: on [Sat 4 Dec 2021], the numbers broke 50 000 for the first time before rising steadily. Since the pandemic began, France has recorded 122 546 deaths from the coronavirus. So far, 76.5% of the population are fully vaccinated.

Abstract
--------
COVID-19 is known to cause multi-organ dysfunction (1-3) in acute infection, with prolonged symptoms experienced by some patients, termed Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) (4-5). However, the burden of infection outside the respiratory tract and time to viral clearance is not well characterized, particularly in the brain (3,6-14). We performed complete autopsies on 44 patients with COVID-19 to map and quantify SARS-CoV-2 distribution, replication, and cell-type specificity across the human body, including brain, from acute infection through over 7 months following symptom onset. We show that SARS-CoV-2 is widely distributed, even among patients who died with asymptomatic to mild COVID-19, and that virus replication is present in multiple extrapulmonary tissues early in infection. Further, we detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in multiple anatomic sites, including regions throughout the brain, for up to 230 days following symptom onset. Despite extensive distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in the body, we observed a paucity of inflammation or direct viral cytopathology outside of the lungs. Our data prove that SARS-CoV-2 causes systemic infection and can persist in the body for months.

Discussion
----------
Here we provide the most comprehensive analysis to date of SARS-CoV-2 cellular tropism, quantification, and persistence across the body and brain, in a diverse autopsy cohort collected throughout the first year of the pandemic in the United States. Our focus on short post mortem intervals, comprehensive approach to tissue collection, and preservation techniques - RNAlater and flash freezing of fresh tissue - allowed us to detect and quantify viral levels with high sensitivity by ddPCR and ISH, as well as culture virus, which are notable differences compared to other studies. We show SARS-CoV-2 disseminates across the human body and brain early in infection at high levels, and provide evidence of virus replication at multiple extrapulmonary sites during the first week following symptom onset. We detected sgRNA in at least one tissue in over half of cases (14/27) beyond D14, suggesting that prolonged viral replication may occur in extra pulmonary tissues as late as D99. While others have questioned if extrapulmonary viral presence is due to either residual blood within the tissue (8,17) or cross-contamination from the lungs during tissue procurement, our data rule out both theories.

The virus genetic compartmentalization that we observed between pulmonary and extrapulmonary sites in several individuals supports independent replication of the virus at these sites, rather than spillover from one site to another. Importantly, lack of compartmentalization between these sites in other individuals does not rule out independent virus replication, as independently replicating populations may share identical sequences if overall diversity is very low. It was also interesting to note several cases where brain-derived virus spike sequences showed non-synonymous differences relative to sequences from other tissues. These differences may indicate differential selective pressure on spike by antiviral antibodies in brain versus other sites, though further studies will be needed to confirm this speculation.

Our results collectively show while that the highest burden of SARS-CoV-2 is in the airways and lung, the virus can disseminate early during infection and infect cells throughout the entire body, including widely throughout the brain. While others have posited this viral dissemination occurs through cell trafficking (11) due to a reported failure to culture virus from blood (3,22), our data support an early viremic phase, which seeds the virus throughout the body following pulmonary infection.

Our findings, therefore, suggest viremia leading to body-wide dissemination, including across the blood-brain barrier, and viral replication can occur early in COVID-19, even in asymptomatic or mild cases.

Finally, a major contribution of our work is a greater understanding of the duration and locations at which SARS-CoV-2 can persist. While the respiratory tract was the most common location in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA tends to linger, ≥50% of late cases also had persistence in the myocardium, thoracic cavity lymph nodes, tongue, peripheral nerves, ocular tissue, and in all sampled areas of the brain, except the dura mater. Interestingly, despite having much lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in early cases compared to respiratory tissues, we found similar levels between pulmonary and the extrapulmonary tissue categories in late cases. This less efficient viral clearance in extrapulmonary tissues is perhaps related to a less robust innate and adaptive immune response outside the respiratory tract.

The mechanisms contributing to PASC are still being investigated; however, ongoing systemic and local inflammatory responses have been proposed to play a role. Our data provide evidence for delayed viral clearance, but do not support significant inflammation outside of the respiratory tract even among patients who died months after symptom onset. Understanding the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 persists and the cellular and subcellular host responses to viral persistence promises to improve the understanding and clinical management of PASC (Post-Acute Sequelae of SARSCoV-2).

[This important study is a very comprehensive analysis of the virus' distribution and persistence in the body and brain by scientists at the National Institutes of Health, mostly analyzing postmortem cases who were post-acute infection. It raises many questions, for example, is this the same as one would see following delta and omicron infection, which were not part of this study? Does post-vaccination infection (that is, breakthrough infection) yield the same results?

"The focus on multiple brain areas is especially helpful, said Al-Aly at the Veterans Affairs St Louis Health Care System. "It can help us understand the neurocognitive decline or 'brain fog' and other neuropsychiatric manifestations of Long COVID," he said. "We need to start thinking of SARS-CoV-2 as a systemic virus that may clear in some people, but in others may persist for weeks or months and produce Long COVID -- a multifaceted systemic disorder."

[Given the holiday weekend, the reduced reporting normally seen over the weekend has been exaggerated even more so, especially in the European region and Latin America so it is hard to really assess the global situational trends given the reported data. Countries not reporting any new cases in this 24 hour period include the UK, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Hungary, Switzerland, Costa Rica. Honduras and Ecuador to name a few. Of those countries that did report newly confirmed cases in this 24 hour period, 13 reported more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases: USA (195 659), France (27 697), Italy (24 882), Russia (23 721), Canada (21 390), Turkey (20 138), Vietnam (15 218), Denmark (14 200), India (11 953), Netherlands 11 886), Australia (10 805), Ireland (10, 404) and Germany 10 158). A global total of 3611 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 25 Dec 2021 to late 26 Dec 2021). [See, however, [1] above, which states that "France reported a record high of 104 611 COVID-19 infections on [Sat 25 Dec 2021]". - Mod.SH]

A total of 44 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 17 of the 44 countries are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the African region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, 4 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, and 2 are from the South East Asia region. Note that the Eastern Mediterranean and Sout East Asian regions are less represented in the "highly active countries list" when compared to a few months ago, and the African and Western Pacific regions are more represented than previously, while the Americas and European regions maintain their dominance in terms of affected countries with high transmission rates.

Keeping in mind the reduced reporting over the holiday weekend, comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 16.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 4.0%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 51.0% increase in daily reported cases and a 12.4% increase in reported deaths, in spite of major under reporting with many states not reporting any newly confirmed cases.

Impression: The global daily report is over 500 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 280.23 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.41 million reported deaths. Interpretation: the pandemic continues to have a global impact, with increased morbidity and mortality. - Mods.UBA/MPP]
