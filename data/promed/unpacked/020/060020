Canadian Surveillance Data 2005 (as of Sat 27 Aug 2005, wk 34)
West Nile Virus National Surveillance Report
--------------------------------------------
21 Aug 2005 - 27 Aug 2005 (Week 34)
Human:
During week 34, 19 West Nile virus (WNV) cases were reported in Canada
[Quebec (1), Ontario (1), Manitoba (14), and Alberta (3)]. As of the 27 Aug
2005, a total of 72 human WNV cases have been reported to the Public Health
Agency of Canada (PHAC). Of these cases, 64 were clinical cases and 8 were
asymptomatic. Of the 64 clinical cases, 19 (30 per cent) were reported as
West Nile neurological syndrome, 36 (56 per cent) were reported as West
Nile non-neurological syndrome, and 9 (14 per cent) were unspecified. 5
cases are travel-related. To date, there have been 3 deaths [Manitoba (1),
Ontario (2)] related to WNV infection.
Bird:
During week 34, 216 dead birds were tested and 74 (34 per cent) were
reported positive for WNV (see bird table). 4 new health units reported
dead birds positive for WNV [1 in Alberta (Chinook), 2 in Saskatchewan (Sun
Country & Saskatoon), and 1 in Ontario (Sudbury)]. A total of 3407 dead
birds have been tested since 2 May 2005, of which 327 (9.6 per cent) were
positive for WNV. 248 (76 per cent) of the 327 positive birds were
identified as American crow and 78 (24 per cent) of them were identified as
blue jay.
Domestic Animal:
As of week 34, 7 horses positive for WNV were reported in Manitoba (3) and
Saskatchewan (4).
Mosquito:
As of week 34, 510 mosquito pools positive for WNV were reported in Alberta
(1), Saskatchewan (87), Manitoba (188), Ontario (188) and Quebec (46).
National West Nile virus surveillance data and maps can be found on the
Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) website at:

Provinces/Territories: Detailed WNV information can be accessed through the
Links section on the PHAC WNV website.

* Cases with neurologic manifestations (such as WN meningitis, WN
encephalitis, WN myelitis)
** Cases with no evidence of neuroinvasion
*** Illnesses for which insufficient clinical information was provided
**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Neuroinvasive Disease refers to severe disease cases, particularly West
Nile meningitis and West Nile encephalitis.
West Nile fever refers to typically less severe cases that show no evidence
of neuroinvasion. West Nile fever is not currently on the list of
nationally notifiable diseases, and therefore it is optional whether or not
state health departments report these cases to CDC [further explanations of
neuroinvasive West Nile virus disease and West Nile fever are available at
the URL above].
"Other Clinical" includes persons with clinical manifestations other than
WN fever, WN encephalitis or WN meningitis, such as acute flaccid
paralysis. Unspecified cases are those for which sufficient clinical
information was not provided.
Total Human Cases Reported to CDC -- These numbers reflect both mild and
severe human disease cases occurring between 1 Jan 2005 and 6 Sep 2005 that
have been reported to ArboNet by state and local health departments.
ArboNet is the national, electronic surveillance system established by CDC
to assist states in tracking West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne
viruses. Information regarding 2005 virus/disease activity is posted when
such cases are reported to CDC.
Of the 821 cases, 333 (41 per cent) were reported as West Nile meningitis
or encephalitis (neuroinvasive disease), 450 (55 per cent) were reported as
West Nile fever (milder disease), and 38 (5 per cent) were clinically
unspecified at this time. Please refer to state health department web sites
for further details regarding state case totals.
Note: The high proportion of neuroinvasive disease cases among reported
cases of West Nile virus disease reflects surveillance reporting bias.
Serious cases are more likely to be reported than mild cases. Also, the
surveillance system is not designed to detect asymptomatic infections. Data
from population-based surveys indicate that among all people who become
infected with West Nile virus (including people with asymptomatic
infections) less than 1 percent will develop severe neuroinvasive disease.
