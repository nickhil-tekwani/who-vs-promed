Malarone resistance
-------------------
Please note that naturally occurring _Plasmodium falciparum_ isolates
with the requisite mutations conferring resistance to
atovaquone-proguanil have been detected in Nigeria in areas without a
history of widespread use of this agent for prophylaxis or treatment
of malaria (1).
The study in Nigeria hypothesized that the practice of using
atovaquone as a rescue therapy for _Pneumocystis jirovecii_
opportunistic infection in HIV patients who could not tolerate
sulfa-based drugs may exert a selective pressure for resistant _P.
falciparum_ isolates.
Alternatively there may be a small number of naturally occurring
isolates, which express this mutation by chance.
Presumably the situation in East Africa is similar.

of mutations associated with atovaquone-proguanil resistance in
unexposed _Plasmodium falciparum_ isolates from Africa; Malaria

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Thomas Coombs for his comments and for
highlighting the 2006 paper in the Malaria Journal by Happi et al. We
certainly agree that the case could be due to Malarone-resistant
malaria, but caution that a single undocumented case where we are not
even certain that the patient had malaria, should not result in
speculations about emerging resistance to Malarone in east Africa.
The case and the study by Happi et al. emphasize the need for
documentation in suspected malaria cases and surveillance. - Mod.EP]
