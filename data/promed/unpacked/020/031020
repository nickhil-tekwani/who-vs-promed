Laboratory testing confirmed Wisconsin's 1st 2020 human death from eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), state health officials announced Friday [4 Sep 2020]. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) and the Chippewa County Health Department sent out a news release with the information.

A Chippewa County woman in her 60s was infected, becoming the 2nd case in the state and the 1st to result in death, after the1st confirmed case on Wednesday [2 Sep 2020; see Eastern equine encephalitis - North America (13): USA (WI) 20200903.7744720)].

Last week, DHS announced that horses in 3 northwestern counties were confirmed to be infected with the virus.

The disease can spread to people through bites from infected mosquitoes.

EEE is rare but potentially fatal. It can affect people regardless of their age, health officials said.

DHS released the following prevention measures:

Avoid mosquito bites:
- Apply an insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535 to exposed skin and clothing.
- Prior to heading outdoors, treat clothing with permethrin; do not apply permethrin directly to skin.
- Consider rescheduling outdoor activities that occur during evening or early morning hours, when mosquitoes are most active.
- Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors to help keep mosquitoes away from your skin.

Mosquito-proof your home:
- Make sure window and door screens are intact and tightly fitted to prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home.
- Prevent mosquitoes from breeding around your home by removing stagnant water from items around your property, such as tin cans, plastic containers, flowerpots, discarded tires, roof gutters, and downspouts.
- Turn over wheelbarrows, kiddie pools, buckets, and small boats, such as canoes and kayaks, when not in use.
- Change the water in bird baths and pet dishes at least every 3 days.
- Clean and chlorinate swimming pools, outdoor saunas, and hot tubs; drain water from pool covers.
- Trim or mow tall grass, weeds, and vines since mosquitoes use these areas to rest during hot daylight hours.

[EEE virus transmission clearly is active in Wisconsin with the 1st human case reported 3 days ago and now a 2nd case that unfortunately was fatal. There have been several cases in horses recently as well. Equine EEE cases have occurred in the state every year for the past 5 years and less frequently prior to that. Other species have been affected in Wisconsin as well: alpacas in 2019 and 2011 and an emu in 2016.

Equine animals in Wisconsin should be vaccinated annually. There is no commercially available vaccine for humans, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only available preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
