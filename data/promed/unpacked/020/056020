Following alarm caused by an outbreak of salmonella poisoning in
Jordan involving 300 people, the Jordanian Ministries of Agriculture
and Health quickly organized a seminar in Amman for table egg and
broiler producers.
The outbreak was caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype]
Enteritidis following the consumption of homemade mayonnaise from
local fast food outlets -- known as "Shawerma" outlets -- prepared
under questionable hygiene conditions.
Such was the importance attached to this event, in addition to major
poultry integrators, it was attended by 10 veterinarians involved in
zoonosis and veterinary services from the Ministry of Agriculture,
Professor Kalel Shawbka from the University of Jordan and Dr Mohamed
Al Nator from Jordan University of Science and Technology, as well as
veterinarians and advisers from the private sector.

[Exactly when this significant outbreak of salmonellosis occurred and
where in Jordan it was located were not stated in the posting. The
eggs in the mayonnaise, a thick, stable emulsion made from egg yolks
and vegetable oil, are certainly likely to be the vehicle.

Saudi Arabia and Iraq, can be found at:
