Continued speculation on the identity of the aetiological agent
---------------------------------------------------------------
The hand, foot and mouth are [far apart, anatomically speaking, but they
are bonded by a common thread: hand, foot and mouth disease. The disease
used to be a harmless childhood problem caused [predominantly by Coxsackie
virus A[16. Almost all patients invariably recovered within 4 to 6 days.
But not any more. The Sarawak outbreak in 1997 and the Taiwanese outbreak
in 1998 led to many deaths. In both outbreaks - where patients' early
symptoms were fever and mouth rash - another virus known as Enterovirus 71
(EV71) was found to be the culprit.
The EV71 variety of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is not benign. It
can trigger complications that affect the brain and spinal cord, which give
rise to fatal lung problems. Of about 100 000 cases reported in the
Taiwanese epidemic, 90 per cent of the patients recovered without any
complications. But about [80 died and 400 developed brain and spinal-cord
complications such as paralysis of the limbs. [A total of 78 children died
from pulmonary edema - excessive fluid in the lungs - or a type of internal
drowning. In the Sarawak outbreak, at least 34 children died. Fatalities
arise from extensive destruction of centers in the brain stem - the
lower-most section of the brain, near the spinal cord - that regulate
breathing. Some authorities think the virus also causes acute inflammation
of the heart muscles, which can result in death.
EV71 was first detected in California in 1974. It was noted sporadically in
Bulgaria in 1975, Hungary and Japan in 1978, and Australia in 1986, before
the 1997 and 1998 outbreaks closer to home. These reported EV71 outbreaks
might only present the tip of an iceberg. But even more sinister is the
likelihood that another virus could also be involved. Dr Jane Cardosa and
other Malaysian co-workers reported in The Lancet that in the 1997 Sarawak
outbreak, all the children who died from EV71 also carried another virus
called adenovirus. This virus is difficult to detect because it is very
slow-growing, and had to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control,
Atlanta, in Georgia, in the US. Dr Cardosa suggests that this virus infects
the heart and, when it is present with EV71, the 2 viruses interact in such
a way that could bring the rapid onset of fatal complications.
Whatever the case, preventive measures must focus on child-care centers.
Transmission of infectious diseases within child-care centers, and from
children who are in day care to parents or siblings when the children get
home, is well-documented. Parents and staff can help by [strict hygiene
control. Child-care centers, in turn, must limit rotation of staff and
children between classrooms.
The multi-ministerial HFMD task force has closed all kindergartens,
child-care centers, nurseries and play centers for at least a week to break
the transmission of the disease. Without a vaccine and effective therapy,
focusing public attention on preventive measures which everyone can take
will go a long way towards stopping the infection from spreading like
wildfire.

[The Singaporean authorities have so far released no information on the
identity of the agent responsible for the present outbreak. Molecular
analyses of EV71 strains isolated from previous outbreaks have revealed
considerable genetic diversity, although not clearly related to relative
pathogenicity. The role of adenovirus type 7, a relatively common virus
associated with respiratory infection and cystitis as well as CNS
infection, as a co-factor in the etiology of severe forms of hand, foot and
mouth disease remains speculative. - Mod.CP

Hand, Foot & Mouth disease Spreads to Older Children
----------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: Hand, foot and mouth disease appears to have spread to older
children with at least one kindergarten confirming an unspecified number of
cases and another being investigated. The kindergarten with clinically
confirmed cases of the disease is Bethesda Pasir Ris Kindergarten. A
statement from the Ministry of the Environment (ENV) yesterday said that it
had been "alerted of a possible cluster of [cases of hand, foot and mouth
disease at YWMA Kindergarten (Bukit Batok Centre)", but it had yet to
confirm if the children were actually ill with the disease.
Meanwhile, there have been another 43 clinically diagnosed cases at
child-care centers, bringing the total since last week to 165 cases. And
the number of child-care centers with infected children is now 28. However,
many of the sick children have now recovered. So far, 58 of them have been
certified fit by their doctors, said an ENV spokesman.

Thirteen New Suspected Cases of Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease Admitted to
Hospital
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: A total of 13 new cases of clinically suspected hand, foot and
mouth disease (HFMD) have been admitted to the isolation wards at KK
Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and National University Hospital
(NUH). This brings the total hospitalized cases to 33, all of them mild
cases in stable condition.
Since HFMD was made legally notifiable on 1 Oct 2000, 229 cases have been
reported. In a daily update of the situation, the 4 ministries involved in
the HFMD taskforce said that of the 27 cases reported to be in hospital on
Tue 3 Oct 2000, 7 have been discharged.
The 5-year old child, whose siblings are suspected to have died from HFMD,
is now out of intensive care.
