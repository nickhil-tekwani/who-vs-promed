A positive case of yellow fever has been recorded in Pará de Minas. The municipal government informed TV Integração that the patient is a 67 year old man whose work involves traveling. In a note sent to g1 on Wednesday (3 [Aug 2022]), the State Department of Health (SES-MG) said that it awaits notification from the Municipality about the case [read the note below].

The suspicion is that the man contracted the disease on one of his work trips. The patient is doing well, and all necessary protocols have been adopted. The disease would have been diagnosed in June [2022], when he underwent tests in a private laboratory in Belo Horizonte. However, the municipal government notified the case to SES-MG last Thursday (29 [Jul 2022]).

The Health Department of Para de Minas says that it has intensified actions to prevent the disease, as well as vaccinating the population.

[Note]
"The Minas Gerais State Health Department (SES-MG) awaits the notification of the case, by the municipality of Pará de Minas, in the Notifiable Diseases Information System (Sinan). SES-MG reinforces that the state Minas Gerais has a vaccination recommendation against yellow fever and constant campaigns to sensitize the population about the need to vaccinate.

"In confirmed cases of yellow fever, the secretariat intensifies vector control, surveillance, and vaccination of the local population, among other actions.

"Yellow fever is an acute, vaccine-preventable viral disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes. Vaccination is the main tool for preventing and controlling yellow fever. The Unified Health System (SUS) offers the yellow fever vaccine to the population."

[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in Brazil, but the risk of human yellow fever virus infections has expanded from its traditional localities to new corridors of transmission. Although these human YF cases like this one are the result of spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle, the risk remains that infected individuals could carry the virus into more urban or periurban settings where the urban vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant and initiate outbreaks of this disease. The challenge is maintenance of at least 80% immunity of the population through ongoing vaccination in remote rural areas where individuals are likely to be in contact with forest ecosystems.

Yellow fever is not only a public health risk. As Mod.PMB noted earlier in ProMED post 20211005.8698865, it is also a concern for the conservation of non-human primates that are endangered or threatened with extinction, such as brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and golden lion tamarins (_Leontopithecus rosalia_), that experience high case fatality rates when infected by YF virus. As mentioned in earlier posts, the greatest risk for YF adverse population effects is the muriqui monkey (_Brachyteles_ - genus of spider monkeys), Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most endangered species of primates. There are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil: the northern muriqui (_B. hypoxanthus_), which has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) critically endangered list for more than 25 years, and the southern muriqui (_B. arachnoides_), which has been placed on that list more recently.

The previous report indicates that brown howler monkeys (_A. guariba_) and masked titis (_Callicebus personatus_) are the non-human primates most affected in this YF outbreak. However, the buffy-headed marmoset (_Callithrix flaviceps_) is also mentioned. It is a rare species of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of southeastern Brazil and occurs in southern Espírito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro, and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais, the very areas where yellow fever has been occurring. Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to halt YF virus transmission among these non-human primates. Killing them is not a solution. One hopes that enough individuals will survive for the species to recover. - Mod.TY
