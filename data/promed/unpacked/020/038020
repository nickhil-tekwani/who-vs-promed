Larval habitats of _Aedes aegypti _ in Calcutta/Kolkata, India
--------------------------------------------------------------
In item 3 - India (Calcutta/Kolkata) - of the Dengue/DHF update of 31 Aug
2005, residents suspected pit latrines were a source of the dengue vector
_Ae. aegypti_. This is extremely unlikely.
Larval habitats of this species comprise almost any man-made container
habitats, including water-storage pots, discarded utensils such as cans and
bottles, flower pots, wells, and gutters to buildings -- although in some
situations larvae occur in natural container habitats such as water-filled
rot holes in trees and rock pools. All these habitats are characterised by
clean water or water with a moderate amount of organic material such as
leaves or residues of human food (upon which the larvae feed) that is
so-called dirty water, but larvae never occur in cess pits, septic tanks or
any other waters contaminated with urine, feces or rotting carcasses.
So it would be very unusual if in this instance in Kolkata that _Ae.
aegypti_ were to be found in pit latrines; it is much more likely that
larvae of _Culex quinquefasciatus_ (vector of bancroftian filariasis,
_Wuchereria bancrofti_) were present in such organically polluted waters.
