In the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) AH5N1, the National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety, and Quality (SENASICA) instructed the strategic vaccination of long-lived birds in high-risk zoo-sanitary areas.

The agency of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development informed producers of the measure, which aims to protect national poultry production and guarantee the supply of chicken meat and eggs.

Vaccination will be carried out in accordance with a strategic plan designed by the technicians of the General Directorate of Animal Health (DGSA) of SENASICA, in coordination with the National Union of Poultry Farmers (UNA), which provides, in the 1st instance, to protect the progenitor and reproductive birds, since they are the origin of the productive chain as mothers of the broiler chicks and the egg-laying hens.

Similarly, the plan considers the protection of poultry production units located in areas of high animal-health risk and in this way avoids losses in the production of chicken and eggs.

At this time 3 Mexican laboratories produce vaccines to be sold abroad, but given the presence of HPAI AH5N1, it has been requested they include distribution in the country for poultry production units [UPAs] authorized by SENASICA.

The DGSA explained the effectiveness tests of the vaccines currently produced in Mexico were carried out in reference laboratories of the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) in other countries, for which the effectiveness of the available biologicals is considered. In order to have greater certainty, the technicians of the National Center for Diagnostic Services in Animal Health (CENACA) of SENASICA, in coordination with the UNA, are already carrying out tests to verify the response of the vaccine to the strain circulating in Mexico.

So far, technicians from the United States-Mexico Commission for the Prevention of Foot-and-Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Animal Diseases (CPA) of SENASICA have confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza AH5N1 in 9 entities of the country.

It has affected 4 commercial UPAs, 3 of them in Sonora and 1 in Nuevo León, as well as 3 backyard farms: Chiapas, Chihuahua, and Estado de México, with a total of 492 000 slaughtered birds, which means 0.023% of the national poultry inventory, so the supply of chicken and eggs for the national market is not compromised.

Similarly, cases have been reported in wild birds in wetlands in the State of Mexico and Jalisco, in a protected nature reserve in Texcoco, and in parks in Baja California, Aguascalientes, and Puebla.

The agency of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development pointed out the coordinated work between health authorities and poultry producers has intensified, with the purpose of increasing biosecurity measures in UPAs throughout the country and protecting national chicken production and egg.

He revealed since the presence of the virus was detected in farms in Sonora and Nuevo León, SENASICA applied internal quarantine, which, in order to mobilize and market poultry products, requires producers to demonstrate their farms are free of IAAP AH5N1 through tests carried out in the official laboratories of the Ministry of Agriculture.

With this measure, he explained, the probability of spreading the virus decreases, and consumers are given certainty about the health of the poultry products they consume.

HPAI AH5N1 is a disease circulating in the world, through migratory birds. Due to its presence in Canada and the United States, Mexican health authorities have measures in place to quickly detect it and act promptly to avoid major damage to the production plant.

The SENASICA CPA technicians continue to respond to notifications and collect samples in places where migratory birds arrive to detect any new intrusion into the national territory.

There is also intense work to promote the timely notification of cases, by veterinarians, producers, and society in general, through the communication channels established by SENASICA, such as the AVISE application, the telephone number 800 751 2100, and the representations of Agriculture, the SENASICA and the CPA, in all the entities of the country.

[2] Sucre: backyard flock, 1st report
Date: Sun 13 Nov 2022

https://www.ica.gov.co/noticias/ica-decreta-emergencia-sanitaria-influencia-aviar


- The health authority reiterates that the presence of the disease in the country does not jeopardize the production or consumption of eggs and chicken meat and, taking into account all the outbreaks have been detected in birds that are not poultry (domestic birds), according to the definition of the Sanitary Code for terrestrial animals of the World Organization for Animal Health - WOAH, Colombia maintains its status as a self-declared country free of avian influenza recognized by this organization since 2011.
- Poultry farms certified as compartments free of avian influenza in the national territory maintain the conditions with which they received their certification as free of this disease.
- The measure was taken in order to facilitate the control and eradication actions of the disease through resolution No. (22990) November 2022.
- The ICA makes a special call to poultry producers to reinforce all biosecurity measures to prevent the entry of the disease into their farms and the spread of the disease.
- The poultry health of the country is everyone's commitment.

As a consequence of the identified outbreaks, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development convened a unified command post with the presence of FENAVI, the Colombian Farmers Society - SAC, the National Liaison Center, the Ministry of Health, the National Institute of Health, the WOAH delegate for the Americas to take the sanitary measures necessary in any part of the country, depending on the existing risk, aimed at controlling and eradicating the disease, as well as to protect the national poultry industry.

As conclusion, it was decided to declare a sanitary emergency in the National Territory due to the presence of avian influenza in domestic backyard birds in order to facilitate the availability of resources, control actions, and eradication of the disease through resolution No.22990 November 2022.

Resources will also be managed with the National Poultry Fund for emergency care, continuing to compensate producers of slaughtered birds, strengthening the biosecurity of productions, and continuing to communicate the sanitary measures implemented.

The health authority reiterates that the presence of the disease in the country does not put at risk the national production or consumption of eggs and chicken meat and ensures inter-institutional work guarantees all efforts are being made, complying with the protocols established to international level to contain the disease and prevent its spread.

The ICA reiterated that taking into account all of the outbreaks have been detected in non-poultry birds (domestic or backyard birds), in accordance with the definition of the Sanitary Code for terrestrial animals of the World Organization for Animal Health - WOAH, Colombia maintains its status as a self-declared country free of avian influenza recognized by this organization since 2011.

Likewise, poultry farms certified as compartments free of avian influenza in the national territory, under the provisions in Resolution ICA 14421 of 2016, to date, maintain the conditions with which they received their certification as free of this disease.

The provisions established in the resolution will be applicable to all natural or legal persons who possess, under any title, commercial, combat, or backyard birds, as well as live bird marketers throughout the national territory.

The declaration will allow the availability of economic resources, application of emergency health, and safety measures, and prohibitions, official control, and sanctions to those who fail to comply with the provisions and put at risk the health of the national poultry industry.

The main preventive measures for the containment and eradication of the disease include the intensification of biosecurity measures, permanent supervision of the control plans for the presence of wild birds, and the urgent call for the country's poultry farmers to immediately report to the institute any sign of disease in birds or low poultry production.

The ICA will determine the final disposition of risk material and will advance the cleaning and disinfection actions of the facilities, vehicles, equipment, and utensils used in the sanitary work.

As a protection and prevention measure, it is prohibited to:

- hold events with chicken and hens in the quarantined areas;
- mobilize sick birds;
- mobilize or commercialize dead birds in the productive cycle, which must be disposed of on the property according to the indications of the ICA;
- mobilize chicken manure without prior verification of its sanitization and respective authorization by the ICA if this is required;
-mobilize any avian risk material without the necessary measures to prevent the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus;
- visit other poultry farms when the ICA has given a specific recommendation that this activity is not to be carried out.

The resolution also establishes the character of sanitary police inspectors for ICA officials in the exercise of inspection, surveillance, and control activities in any case, which will have the support and protection of the civil and military authorities for the fulfillment of their functions.

Any breach will be sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of Law 1255 of 2008 "by which the creation of a program that preserves the health status of the country free of avian influenza is declared of national social interest and a health priority."

The health authority makes a special call to poultry producers to reinforce all biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of the disease and indicated any additional announcement will be made through official ICA channels. The poultry health of the country is everyone's commitment.

In response to a suspicion of avian disease, compatible with avian influenza, reported by the owner of the property on [4 Nov 2022], the National Diagnostic Laboratory of the Colombian Agricultural Institute - ICA, confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the property of Villa Truco backyard, in a rural area of the municipality of Los Palmitos in the department of Sucre.

The total population of the property was 180 birds, 35 of which died, and the remaining 145, as a sanitary measure for the control and eradication of the disease and in accordance with the established technical procedures, were slaughtered by the ICA technical staff, who also initiated epidemiological surveillance and cleaning and disinfection actions in the area to contain and eradicate the disease.

Like the previous outbreaks, the hypothesis of the origin of this new outbreak is a close interaction of backyard birds with wild birds, which used a mirror of water located on the property to rest.

The presence of the disease in the department does not place the production or the local consumption of chicken eggs and meat at risk.

[3] Ohio (Butler County): backyard flock
Date: Wed 9 Nov 2022
Source: Yahoo.com [edited]
https://www.yahoo.com/video/highly-contagious-bird-flu-detected-161213542.html


The contagious bird flu known as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been detected in Butler County.

The virus was found in a backyard poultry flock on [8 Nov 2022] the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) said.

Ohio Department of Agriculture's Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory first tested the infected samples, which was then confirmed by APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL).

State officials quarantined and depopulated the affected area to prevent the spread of the disease, a spokesperson stated in a press release.

Butler County General Health District (BCGHD), the Ohio Department of Agriculture, and the Ohio Department of Health are investigating this outbreak.

HPAI can spread quickly, "devastating" commercial and non-commercial poultry, the spokesperson said. The disease can also infect humans. However, this recent detection "does not present an immediate public health concern to the residents of Butler County or neighboring areas," the spokesperson said.

USDA recommends properly handling and cooking all poultry and eggs to prevent transmission. An internal cooking temperature of 165 deg F [73.9 deg C] is recommended as a general food safety precaution.

Ohio Department of Agriculture recommends these tips to maintain biosecurity:

- Prevent contact with wild birds and waterfowl. Keep birds indoors when possible.
- Keep visitors to essential personnel only. Only allow those who care for your poultry to have contact with them and make sure they follow biosecurity principles.
- Wash your hands before and after contact with live poultry. Use soap and water. If using a hand sanitizer, first remove manure, feathers, and other materials from your hands.
- Provide disposable boot covers (preferred) and/or disinfectant footbaths for anyone having contact with your flock. If using a footbath, remove all droppings, mud, or debris from boots and shoes using a long-handled brush before stepping in. Always keep it clean.
- Establish a rodent and pest control program. Deliver, store, and maintain feed, ingredients, bedding, and litter to limit exposure to and contamination from wild animals.
- Use drinking water sourced from a contained supply (well or municipal system). Do not use surface water for drinking or cleaning.
- Clean and disinfect tools and equipment before moving them to a new poultry facility. Trucks, tractors, tools, and equipment should be cleaned and disinfected prior to entering or exiting the property. Do not move or reuse anything that cannot be cleaned.
- Look for signs of illness. Monitor egg production and death loss, discoloration and/or swelling of legs, wattles and combs, labored breathing, reduced feed/water consumption.
- Officials recommend reporting any signs or unexpected deaths in flocks to the Ohio Poultry Association at 614-882-6111. You can also contact the Ohio Department of Agriculture during normal business hours or at its after-hours line.

https://www.wattagnet.com/articles/46165-pennsylvania-county-has-4-hpai-cases-in-less-than-week


Pennsylvania county has 4 HPAI cases in less than a week. All cases have impacted turkey operations in Lehigh County. Two new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) were reported in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania, with both cases being confirmed on [Tue 8 Nov 2022].

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported 1 of those flocks involved 17 400 commercial meat turkeys, while the other flock involved turkey breeder hens. However, the number of turkeys in the breeder flock has not yet been released.

Prior to the confirmation of these 2 cases, APHIS reported the presence of HPAI 2 other commercial meat turkey flocks in Lehigh County on [3 and 4 Nov 2022] with those flocks including 28 500 and 14 500 birds, respectively.

With these 2 new cases, Pennsylvania has had 23 cases of HPAI in commercial turkey flocks in 2022. Only Minnesota and South Dakota have had more cases in commercial flocks, with 77 and 44, respectively.

HPAI hits upland gamebirds in Wisconsin
---------------------------------------
APHIS also reported the presence of HPAI in an upland gamebird flock in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, on [7 Nov 2022]. There were 180 000 birds in the flock.

This case marks the 2nd case of HPAI in Jefferson County in 2022. The 1st was a commercial layer flock. That case, which affected 2 750 700 hens, was confirmed on [14 Mar 2022] and marked the state's 1st case of HPAI in a commercial poultry flock.

In addition to the gamebird flock, 10 commercial poultry flocks in Wisconsin have been affected by HPAI, affecting turkeys, layers, and ducks.

[5] Utah (entire state): turkeys
Date: Thu 10 Nov 2022

https://townlift.com/2022/11/over-700000-turkeys-euthanized-in-utah-due-to-avian-flu/


According to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food (UDAF), over 700 000 turkeys from 18 different Utah farms have been euthanized due to an avian flu outbreak.

Health professionals confirm while the bird flu causes significant health risks to birds, there is a slim chance it will spread to humans.

According to UDAF officials, all the turkeys on the 18 Utah farms were euthanized to stop the disease's spread and spare the animals the agony they would otherwise endure.

Avian flu is contracted through wild birds, which is why cases increase during migratory seasons such as spring and fall. The UDAF reported the 1st avian flu infections earlier this summer, but cases did not start taking off until August [2022].

The UDAF now estimates around 2.2 million birds throughout the country [likely this is the area within Utah as we have had many millions of birds killed in the USA - Mod.TG] have become infected with the avian flu.

This killer disease will also impact millions of Americans this holiday season, as there is already an expected shortage of turkeys over Thanksgiving, and according to the United States Department of Agriculture, inflation has already caused the average retail price for turkey to go up 50%, to just about USD 2 per pound.

Signs of avian flu include high death loss among flocks, nasal discharge, decreased appetite or water consumption, and lack of coordination in birds. If domestic birds are experiencing any of these signs, please contact the state veterinarian's office immediately at <statevet@utah.gov>. Early reporting and action will help to contain the disease.

[The threat of avian influenza H5N1 is still extremely prevalent and causing problems for producers and governments as well as death for millions of birds as the carriers of the disease migrate south for the winter of the Northern Hemisphere.

One country [Mexico, item 1] has ordered vaccination, which hopefully will stem the tide for them of this winged plague affecting our poultry at every level.

Regardless of your country or state, take any and all biosecurity measures seriously. Protect your birds and yourself. - Mod.TG
