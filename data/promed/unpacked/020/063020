Salmonellosis in wild birds in Quebec

Similar to what occurred in the northeastern states of the United States,
an epornitic of avian salmonellosis was diagnosed in wild birds in Quebec,
Canada, during the last 4-5 months. Dead birds were found commonly around
bird-feeding stations throughout Quebec.
Increased death rate around bird feeding stations was first recorded in
early March. Three cases were diagnosed in early April by isolation of a
group B Salmonella from the lesions. Postmortem consistently revealed
pyogranulomatous stomatitis or ingluvitis, and hepatitis. Wildlife
biologists, ornithologists groups and media were warned about the zoonotic
aspect of the disease. The public was instructed to remove and disinfect
feeding stations.
Confirmed cases:
- 2 common redpolls from the Baie-des-Chaleurs area (17/03/98): _Salmonella
typhimurium_. Several other birds, including additional common redpolls,
black-capped chickadees (_Parus atricapillus_) and pine grosbeaks
(_Pinicola enucleator_) died at the same period in the Gaspesie area but
were not submitted for necropsy.
- 4 common redpolls (Carduelis flammea) from the Saguenay area (05/04/98):
_Salmonella typhimurium_(out of 100-150 redpolls around the bird feeding
station).
- 1 white-winged crossbill (_Loxia leucoptera_) from the Mauricie area
(08/04/98): _Salmonella derby_ (several birds (unidentified species) died
around the feeding station before this case was submitted).
- 5 common redpolls from the Rimouski area (27/04/98): _Salmonella
typhimurium_.
Unconfirmed cases:
- Undetermined number of unidentified species (including house sparrows and
northern cardinals), first week of March, Sorel area (Monteregie).
- Common redpolls from the Lac Brome area (Estrie): >3 out of 100 redpolls
around a bird feeding station.
- Undetermined number of unidentified species (presumably including house
sparrows), first week of March, Sherbrooke area (Estrie area).
- Undetermined number of unidentified species, third week of April, Quebec
area.
