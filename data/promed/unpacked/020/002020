A meningitis outbreak started the 23 Sep 2002 in the Rwanguba Health zone,
located at 80 km of Goma, in the Province of North Kivu, Democratic Republic
of Congo. The epidemic thresholds was reached within 2 weeks. The outbreak
is still confined in this health zone comprising 50 000 inhabitants. Until
now, a total of 109 patients and 22 deaths has been reported by the Health
authorities of Rwanguba (case fatality rate of 20.19%).
The etiological agent has been identified by the Provincial Public Health
Reference laboratory on 5 Oct 02. All strains isolated from cerebrospinal
fluid samples of patients were identified as _Neisseria meningitidis_
belonging to serogroup A. The serotyping is actually done in Europe. The
strains are resistant to sulfonamides, but were susceptible to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, and ceftriaxone which are the first line drugs used for the
treatment of bacterial meningitis locally.
Following the epidemiological and microbiological results, a late reactive
immunization campaign has now been started by the Provincial Health
authorities with the support of two NGO's: MSF-Holland and CEMUBAC-Belgium.
This situation underscores [the fact] that despite effective surveillance
systems and laboratory network, the delay between the beginning of the
epidemic and mass vaccination is still [large] in the province of Nord-Kivu.
In regard to this situation, authorities should consider setting up a
regional stock of vaccine to initiate reactive mass campaigns when outbreaks
occur.

[ProMED thanks Dr Ndeba for this report from the field. Although serotype A
is endemic in the meningitis belt of Africa, and not strictly an emerging
disease there, we encourage direct reporting of outbreaks. - Mod.JW]
