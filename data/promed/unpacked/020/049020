Group A streptococcal infections: seasonal activity, England, 2013/14
---------------------------------------------------------------------
National surveillance data for group A (_Streptococcus pyogenes_; GAS) streptococcal infections show an increase in scarlet fever notifications above the seasonally expected levels for England [1,2]. Routine laboratory reports and isolate referrals are not currently showing signs of elevation of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease incidence. Analysis of scarlet fever notifications over the last century suggest cyclical patterns of incidence, with resurgences occurring on average every 4 years and invasive GAS infections tending to mirror the trend in superficial disease [3,4]. The last peak year for scarlet fever was 2008/09. Scarlet fever incidence so far this year [2013/14] is the highest since 1989/90.

Scarlet fever
-------------
Routine monitoring of surveillance data identified widespread increases in scarlet fever notifications in February 2014 compared to recent years. These increases continued into March [2014], with weeks 10 and 11 of 2014 being particularly high, where numbers of notifications surpassed levels seen in the last peak year (2008/09). A total of 3548 notifications of scarlet fever have been made so far this season in England (weeks 37 of 2013 to 11 of 2014) compared to an average of 1420 (range: 807 to 2622) for this same period in the previous 10 years. The last season to have this level of scarlet fever activity was 1989/1990 where 4042 notifications were received by week 11. The age distribution of cases notified so far for this season remains similar to previous years, with 87 percent being children under 10 years (median 4 years). The increase in scarlet fever has been seen across England.

Invasive Group A Streptococcus
------------------------------
A total of 680 iGAS isolates, defined as isolation of GAS from a normally sterile site, were referred to the Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit at Colindale PHE [Public Health England] from laboratories in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for specimens taken this season (week 37 of 2013 to 11 of 2014), a slight increase on the average (621 reports) but within the range (509-755 reports) for the same period in the previous 5 years. Antimicrobial susceptibility results from routine iGAS laboratory reports for the season so far indicate no changes in resistance patterns.

Clinicians, microbiologists and health protection teams should continue to be mindful of potential increases in invasive disease and maintain a high index of suspicion in relevant patients as early recognition and prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for patients with GAS infection can be life-saving.
