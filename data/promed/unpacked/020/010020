Pet owners in southwest London have been put on high alert after a dog was killed by a mysterious flesh-eating disease.

Vets today [27 Apr 2016] confirmed a pet had died from "Alabama Rot," an illness which sparked fears of an outbreak in December [2015] following the deaths of 4 dogs.

Symptoms include skin lesions, vomiting and tiredness, although the cause is unknown. The majority of cases are fatal, with animals usually dying within 3 days from kidney failure.

Today's [27 Apr 2016] confirmed death comes after reports earlier this month [April 2016] from rangers at Wimbledon and Putney Commons that a dog died with the symptoms linked to the disease.

The group maintains 4 spaces across southwest London including popular dog walking spots Wimbledon Common and Putney Heath.

A statement on the Wimbledon and Putney Commons website reads: "We have been advised by a local veterinary practice that the suspected case of CRGV, or Alabama Rot, in a local dog has been confirmed. However, as the dog was also walked in other local parks and open spaces, it is still not certain that the disease is here on the commons. The causes of the disease, and how it is contracted, are not yet understood but given its potential seriousness, we would encourage dog owners and walkers to be aware of the symptoms and, if at all concerned, to seek veterinary advice as soon as possible."

The majority of cases are fatal and can kill in 3 days, but the cause remains unknown. The disease does not appear to pass from dog to dog.

[A more current (2 May 2016) report on a fatal case of Alabama Rot from another location in England (Wigan) is available at http://www.wigantoday.net/news/local/vets-confirm-new-case-of-deadly-dog-disease-1-7885068.

Similar cases in dogs from various locations in England, some of them referred to as the "New Forest disease," have been addressed by ProMED-mail in several postings since September 2011, referred to as "undiagnosed." In April 2015, a team of 9 authors, consisting of 6 British and 3 Americans, have published the results of their common investigations (Ref 1), leading them to believe that the disease is cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV or Alabama rot), a condition which has been seen in the USA in greyhounds for almost 30 years. While there have been occasional reports of the disease in individual dogs outside of the USA, this is the 1st report of a series of cases occurring in England. None of the 30 dogs in this English series of cases were greyhounds, and evidence of the disease was found in 15 different breeds of dog.

The paper includes information on dogs that had presented at 53 English veterinary practices between 1 Nov 2012 and 31 Mar 2014 with skin lesions, acute kidney injury of no identifiable cause, and histopathology showing evidence of blood clots in the small vessels of the kidney (renal thrombotic microangiopathy). Cases were identified both from searches of the practice records and the memories of vets working at the practices.

A total of 71 possible cases occurred during the study period, but 41 were excluded due to limited investigations or because medical records were incomplete.

The 30 dogs that met all 3 criteria fell into a variety of breeds: English springer spaniel (5 dogs), crossbreed above 20 kg (4 dogs), flat coated retriever (4 dogs), whippet (3 dogs), border collie (2 dogs), Jack Russell terrier (2 dogs), Doberman (2 dogs), and one each of Labrador retriever, cocker spaniel, Staffordshire bull terrier, Hungarian Vizsla, Weimaraner, Dalmatian, Tibetan terrier, and crossbreed below 20 kg (44 lbs).

The dogs were located in multiple areas of northern and southern England (the biggest cluster in the New Forest National Park), visiting woodlands shortly (4 hours to 14 days) before developing skin lesions and/or becoming unwell.

Most of the dogs had been taken to the vet by their owners because of skin lesions. Some dogs were already unwell, but in others, systemic clinical signs (tiredness, loss of appetite, vomiting and fever) generally developed a few days later. No evidence of _E. coli_ Shiga toxin, which can cause sudden onset kidney damage in humans as part of a disease called haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), was found in the kidneys or faeces of affected dogs. 24 the 30 dogs died or were put to sleep because of the disease, and 6 were put to sleep at their owner's request.

Acute kidney injury in these dogs was caused by damage to the small blood vessels of the kidney (renal thrombotic microangiopathy). In their discussion, the authors indicate that renal thrombotic microangiopathy is relatively rare; the pathology is also found in another rare disorder affecting dogs and humans -- haemolytic uraemic syndrome -- which results in acute kidney injury and anaemia, but which is not associated with skin lesions.

The authors say that it is unclear whether canine haemolytic uraemic syndrome and cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy [Alabama rot] are 2 distinct diseases. They conclude that continued detailed clinical, pathological, and epidemiological evaluation will improve understanding of the disease and help to identify possible triggers and the best management options. Currently, it is unclear whether this is an emerging disease or one that was previously present but unrecognised. The etiology remains to be unraveled.

In a recent (2016) letter to the Veterinary Record (Ref 2), the authors address the need for an early decision if an erosive or ulcerative skin lesion of unknown cause is the result of CRGV or something else, as azotaemia [abnormally high levels of nitrogen-containing compounds (such as urea, creatinine, various body waste compounds, and other nitrogen-rich compounds) in the blood] is typically absent at initial presentation, and urine-concentrating ability may be retained. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) measurement may allow early detection of pre-azotaemic acute kidney injury (AKI) and thus direct appropriate management. Veterinary surgeons presented with a dog with skin lesion(s) of unknown cause were invited to contact <medicine@andersonmoores.com> (phone 01962 767920) to discuss GFR measurement. "Samples can be collected in their practices, and laboratory testing will be performed at the Royal Veterinary College; results will be available within 24 hours, thus aiding clinical decision making. Aside from blood sampling, all costs will be covered."
