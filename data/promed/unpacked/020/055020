RABIES, FOX - USA (NORTH CAROLINA) (02)

While these were truly unfortunate incidents, and the information posted is
excellent and raises mostly valid concerns, I feel I must comment on one
statement/question in the post:
..."(why don't people stay inside when a rabid animal is on the loose in
the
vicinity? ..."
How are people supposed to KNOW a rabid animal is around? Was the info put
out on all radio and TV stations? Did public address vehicles tour the
streets spreading the news? What was the time frame from the first of the
incidents to reporting to the authorities? How was anyone, especially a
seven year old, supposed to know the animal might still be in the area?
What if she had been at school all day, and picked up by a parent who had
been working all day in another area? Was there a notice on the house when
they got home? Was someone running up and down the street screaming "Rabid
fox!"?
People don't stay inside if they don't know there is a reason to do so.
People don't know there is a reason unless they are informed. People don't
become informed if the authorities are lackadaisical or lack methods for
informing the populace.
It often takes a case as serious as this one to wake up the authorities as
well as the general public. Yes, we do need to do a lot of education
regarding the current problems.
[My point is that we, unfortunately, cannot depend on neighbors informing
each other if there is a public health emergency. As this posting
illustrates, the alternative to word of mouth broadcasting is cumbersome,
expensive and inherently beaucratic. In many parts of the world
communication about the environment is such a deeply woven part of the
cultural fabric, that I'm sure they will have a very hard time
understanding how the 7 year old girl got bit. In this instance, at least,
we did not have the luxury of an effective word of mouth system in the face
of a public health emergency - a not to be underrated asset. I, however,
recognize the other side of this coin: word of mouth can potentially
become a source of misinformation (and disinformation) as well. - Mod. pc]
