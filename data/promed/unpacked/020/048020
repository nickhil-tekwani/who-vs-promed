Re: [For comparison (with tetramine), the human oral LD50 [the dose of a toxin that will kill 50 percent of a group of subjects] of ricin seeds has been estimated to be about 1 microgram/kilogram (Rodenticide, food poisoning - China: (SA)
Archive Number: 20150620.3452028). - Mod.JW]

The LD50 you cite above is a low range value for pure ricin toxin by the injection or inhalation route, not for oral dose of raw ricin seed:
http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/BMBL5_sect_VIII_g.pdf.

The estimated oral lethal dose in humans is several orders of magnitude higher than injection or inhalation, [i.e.: 1-20 milligrams/kg by ingestion route [not micrograms/kg], because ricin toxin is not readily metabolized by gastrointestinal route: http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=201818
and
"Acute symptoms in humans after intake of castor beans are hematemesis (vomiting containing blood), diarrhoea, haemorrhagic necroses in several organs, renal failure, circulatory collapse and death after 6 to 14 days with a fatal oral dose of about 1 mg/kg b.w. [body weight] (5-10 castor beans)." from the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM)
http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/726.htm.

Many references erroneously cite the injection/inhalation LD50 dose for ricin as the oral dose by using micrograms instead of milligrams; here are some others:
Chemical Warfare Agents: Chemistry, Pharmacology, Toxicology, and Therapeutics, 2nd edition (Romano JA, Lukey BJ, Salem H eds) 2008 [p. 55] Table 3.2: human 5-20 mg/kg
NB: source cited for this value is Franz, D.R. and Jaax, N.K. (1997). Ricin toxin.
In: Textbook of Military Medicine, Part I Warfare, Weaponry, and the Casualty. Medical Aspects of Chemical and Biological Warfare. Sidell, F.R., Takafuji, E.T., and Franz, D.R. (eds), Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., pp. 631-642)
https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGcnAIu4vyIC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=Franz,+D.R.+and+Jaax,+N.K.+(1997). +Ricin+toxin&source=bl&ots=piFN8pu_FL&sig=_XdCUQqomfcv_dt3_AYvNMG5R6E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d-iJVciDBuSz7gbfo4PIDA&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Franz%2C%20D.R.%20and%20Jaax%2C%20N.K.%20(1997).%20Ricin%20toxin&f=false]

However, Franz & Jax 1997 don't give a human LD50 value.

[Romano p. 434]
Published LD50 values for ricin vary considerably, which likely reflects interlaboratory differences in the quality of toxin preparations, the mode of exposure, the postexposure observation interval, and other differences in methodology (Hunt et al., 1918) [see source].
[Romano pp. 440-441]
It is widely cited that approximately 1 mg/kg ricin p.o. [per os = oral] is fatal for humans; this is significantly lower than the measured intragastric LD50 of approximately 20 mg/kg for laboratory mice (Hunt et al., 1918; Kopferschmitt et al., 1983; Wedin et al., 1986; Franz and Jaax, 1997; Palatnick and Tenenbein, 2000). Although humans may be particularly susceptible to ricin poisoning, there is little basis for an informed estimate because of the great variation in the amount of toxin contained in castor seeds, as well as variations in the circumstances of poisoning (Hunt et al., 1918; Balint, 1974) [see source]. There are also wide differences expected in the amount of toxin released.

[The value for human oral LD50 for seeds that I used was from D. Michael Gill (1982) Microbiol.Rev.March pp.86-94 Table 1, which shows more than 500 nanograms, i.e., more than 0.5 microgram (based on a cancer patient surviving an experimental therapeutic dose of 500 nanograms).

I am grateful to Joe for providing these additional references. - Mod.JW
