Edmonton dentist tests positive for hepatitis B; 1400 patients to be informed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The patients of an Edmonton dentist who quit his practice in February
[2008] after testing positive for hepatitis B will now be contacted
and told about the situation. Health authorities started calling
patients of the dentist on Tuesday [17 Jun 2008]. The dentist has
practised in Alberta since 2001. Dr Gerry Predy, vice-president of
Capital Health, said the chance the disease was transmitted to any of
the dentist's 1400 patients is very low -- somewhere between one in
10 000 and one in 100 000. "We don't anticipate that this is
something people should be overly concerned about," said Predy.

Although the chances are small, officials decided to inform the
public upfront rather then having it be found out later where it
could "generate concern beyond what it should generate." Predy said
it took until now for an expert panel to determine how to handle the
situation, complete a risk analysis, and compile a list of his
patients. "He wasn't putting anyone else at risk by virtue of this
time frame that's elapsed," Predy said.

He said the 37-year-old dentist has been co-operative and gave
permission for his name to be released so that his current and past
patients can be tested as a precaution. But that's as much
information Predy was willing to give. He responded to some questions
from reporters, including whether the dentist would be able to
practise again, by saying some details must be withheld to protect
the dentist's medical privacy.

"There's a number of complexities following this situation," Predy
said, adding that the situation is very unique. "Not just the
individual has hepatitis B, but some of the other circumstances
around it." He wouldn't clarify what he meant.

Dr Jonathan Skuba, president of the Alberta Dental Association and
College, said this particular scenario has never happened before in
the province. There are no current rules forcing dentists to get
tested for infectious diseases, but if they find out they have one it
must be reported. "No health profession in Alberta has required blood
testing of their health practitioners," Skuba said. "Knowing the
nature of viruses and infections it would almost become impossible
because someone could register, test negative, and a week later test positive."

Predy suggested the dentist's patients wait until Capital Health
nurses get in touch with them, although they can contact the
department if they have questions. He said the number of hepatitis B
cases has been decreasing. In the 1990s, there were around 30 cases
per year compared to between 5 and 10 right now. During follow ups in
response to these cases, he said no one has revealed they'd recently
had dental work. Predy said children above 10 and adults up to the
age around 28 are likely immune to hepatitis B as a result of
elementary school vaccinations. Also, dental students are now
required to get the shots. "Vaccine given at that age is highly
effective, probably over 99 per cent."

Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused by a virus. Most people
who get hepatitis B recover in about 3 months. Other people get over
their illness but do not get rid of the virus and become carriers who
will have the hepatitis B virus for the rest of their life, though
they won't have any symptoms. They often do not know they are
carriers and may spread the hepatitis B virus to others. In a small
number of people, the disease is severe enough to cause death.

[Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the
liver. Hepatitis B virus (HBV), can cause lifelong infection,
cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer, liver failure, and death. HBV
is transmitted through activities that involve percutaneous or
mucosal contact with infectious blood or body fluids (such as, semen,
saliva). HBV is not spread through food or water, sharing eating
utensils, breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, hand contact, coughing, or sneezing.

The risk of transmission of HBV from dentist to patient is therefore
minimal unless there is exposure of the patient to blood or
secretions from the dentist. Under normal circumstances a dentist
might be at greater risk of contracting HBV from a patient rather
than the reverse. Further information would be appreciated with
regard to Dr Predy's statement that "There's a number of complexities
following this situation, which are very unique," but which he would
not disclose.
