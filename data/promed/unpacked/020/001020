The Moscow authorities have firmly denied a report that three people had
already died of rabies but have issued stern warnings that the Russian
capital faces the most threatening outbreak of rabies in half a century,
partly because cash shortages have bitten into the budget for
preventive measures in surrounding countryside.
Some 80 rabid animals have been officially identified in Moscow Region
around the city so far this year, double the figure for the whole of last
year and 10 times what it was three years ago. That has raised fears of an
epidemic of the sort last seen in the chaotic period after World War Two.
"We haven't had rabies in Moscow city since 1946, when there was an epidemic
and they had to destroy animals because dozens of people died," said Sergei
Sereda, director of the Tsentr Veterinary Clinic in central Moscow. His busy
surgery is plastered with warnings urging pet owners to have their dogs and
cats vaccinated immediately.
Alexander Tunik of Moscow city council's veterinary service confirmed that
there had been a handful of recorded instances of animals inside the city
with the disease in recent months. All of these, however, had been infected
when their owners had taken them to the countryside over the summer, when
millions of Muscovites retreat to their garden plots known as dachas. "We
don't have true rabies in the city yet. And, thank God, it hasn't affected
people -- for the time being," he said. "The problem is in Moscow Region. In
the past, it has been controlled by putting oral vaccines in feed for foxes
and other animals. But now they don't have the funds."
The alternative, Sereda said, was for pet owners to have their own animals
vaccinated. But he estimated there may be more than a million dogs and
several million cats in the city of some 12 million people -- only a small
proportion had been inoculated even though it cost as little as 1 dollar.
"Unfortunately there's no law which forces people to seek this vaccination,"
he said.
Adding to the problem is the large number of stray dogs and cats roaming the
streets of the capital. "These animals move around a lot and so the more
strays there are, the risk goes up geometrically," Sereda said. "The risk of
illness is growing every day. In my 20 years of practice I've never seen
anything like it," he added.
Moscow's populist mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, ran into flak last year from animal
rights campaigners in the West, notably French film star Brigitte Bardot,
over reports that city employees were shooting stray dogs. In fact, efforts
to control the population concentrate on sterilising the strays, officials say.
In 1996, the last year for which figures were available, eight Russians died
of rabies out of 439 who sought medical help after being bitten by infected
animals, official data showed.
[The majority of Muscovites live in apartments, which is why their dogs had
to become infected during the summer while on holiday with their owners. If
urban rabies develops in the stray population various scenarios can be
envisaged, as winter will soon arrive and depend on garbage disposal and
whether feral dogs & cats are fed - Mod.MHJ]

The following data on rabies in Russia were extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
The Russian Federation reported 14 cases of human rabies in 1990;
9 in 1992;
5 in 1993;
7 in 1994;
6 in 1996;
12 in 1997.
Two fatal infections by European bat Lyssavirus (EBL) biotype 1 were
acquired from bats during 1965 to 1995.
- Domestic animals accounted for 66.2% of all animal
rabies registered in 1990 (52% of these were cattle, 18% cats and
16% dogs) - fox rabies was not reported that year. 823 rabid
animals were reported in 1994 (23.3% dogs, 35.8% ruminants, 13.4%
cats); 1,779 in 1996 (26.2% dogs, 38.3% ruminants, 18.7% foxes).
- 4 rabid bats were reported during 1977 to 1995.
