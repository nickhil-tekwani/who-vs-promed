More than 100 cases of rabies were reported in Arkansas as of 24 Jun [2014], a number almost double the normal level, which state health and animal science experts attributed to a greater awareness of rabies symptoms in infected animals. "It has been increasing," said Tom Troxel, associate head of animal science for the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture. Last year [2013], there were a total of 152 cases; in 2012, there were 131 cases and 60 cases in 2011. The reason for the outbreak is unknown, he said.

"It is already double" the usual number of cases, Arkansas public health veterinarian, Susan Weinstein, said. "Skunks and bats are the reservoir" for the rabies virus.

Of the 103 cases, 86 are confirmed in skunks, Troxel said. Pulaski and Lonoke counties have the most cases, 26 for Pulaski and 13 for Lonoke. Widespread publicity about rabies cases in the 2 counties may be the reason for the high number of reported cases. People are more aware and submit more suspicious animals, Weinstein said. "The peak time for rabies cases is March and April, with a smaller rise again in late summer and early fall," she said.

Even though Weinstein doesn't expect to see another 100 cases during the rest of this year [2014], this number is still very high. If the number continues, surely it will be record breaking, Troxel said.

Rabies is a deadly viral disease that affects the nervous system of mammals, according to the Arkansas Department of Health. It is considered one of the most infectious diseases and is fatal for both animals and people, Weinstein said.

Make sure pets are vaccinated by a licensed veterinarian, and don't rely on over-the-counter rabies medication, Troxel added. There has been one case of a rabid dog and 2 cases of rabid cats this year [2014].

Stay away from wildlife, especially those whose behavior is different from normal. Skunks and bats are nocturnal animals, so if they are out during the day, it may be a sign that they are rabid, he said. Be sure pets and children also stay away from bats and skunks during the day.

Possible exposure to rabid animals needs to be taken seriously, Weinstein said. People tend to ignore reporting bat bites, thinking it's not dangerous, she added. There is a series of injections that can be done to prevent rabies. Once the symptoms appear, the disease can't be treated, she said.

If you see a suspicious skunk, bat, or other wildlife, report it to an animal control officer.

[In the USA, there exist several wildlife variants of Lyssavirus that circulate in bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes and coyotes. Transmission rarely occurs between species, and these "spillover events" generally are not perpetuated in the recipient species.

Main terrestrial reservoirs differ depending on the geographical location. Raccoon rabies virus variant is present in the eastern United States, skunk rabies in the Central United States and California, and fox rabies in Texas, Arizona, and Alaska (see map at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2012-surveillance/reservoirs.html).

It should be taken into account that part of the increase in this year's [2014] figures may be explained by report bias (many people looking for cases). It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs and cats in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
