The number of new cases of syphilis and HIV has risen sharply in recent years in Saxony-Anhalt. The managing director of AIDS-Hilfe [National Federation of AIDS support], Sven Warminsky, warned that the number of infections will continue to increase and they demand an increase in the budget for prevention.

In Saxony-Anhalt, more and more people are living with HIV or syphilis. The number of infections will continue to increase, warned Warminsky and added, "the spread of syphilis is always a warning sign that HIV infections will increase."

In contrast to HIV, syphilis is curable. However, in its early stages this infectious disease is often difficult to discern. Possible signs of syphilis infection include reddish ulcers on the genitals, which are initially usually not accompanied by pain. About 2 months after an infection there are often flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, and body aches. In addition, the lymph nodes swell and an itchy rash develops. If the disease is not detected and treated, long-term organ damage, among other things can occur.

According to the latest data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) syphilis numbers in Saxony-Anhalt have increased significantly. In 2013 90 new cases were reported, 79 cases were reported in 2012, while in 2011 there were only 35 cases.

[Saxony-Anhalt, with a population of 2.34 million, is a state in the center of Germany, surrounded by the federal states of Lower Saxony, Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony-Anhalt#History). Its capital is Magdeburg.

The news report above says that there is a rise in the incidence of both syphilis and HIV infection in Saxony-Anhalt, but does not indicate the frequency HIV co-infection among those with syphilis.

ProMED-mail has posted reports of the recent increased incidence of syphilis in many countries that is occurring mainly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and is characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently, use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site. A discussion of the risk for acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases associated with use of the internet, mobile phones and social networking sites can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/std/life-stages-populations/Adolescents-white-paper.pdf.

A more detailed description of the cases in Saxony-Anhalt is essential so that efforts to limit potential spread of syphilis can be effectively targeted. More information in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
