Northern Ireland authorities investigate suspected rabies case
--------------------------------------------------------------
A suspected case of rabies is being investigated in Northern Ireland. The
patient was taken ill after returning from overseas in an area associated
with the infection and may have been bitten there. Initial tests on the
patient proved positive and further tests are being carried out to confirm
the diagnosis. There is no treatment for the infection, which is always
fatal, according to the medical authorities.

The Eastern Health and Social Services Board in Belfast is leading a
multi-agency investigation into what it said was "a highly likely case of
human rabies." The patient was initially treated in the Ulster Hospital at
Dundonald on the outskirts of Belfast and is now in the Royal Victoria
Hospital in the city. The board insisted the risk to the wider community
was negligible -- there [has been] no documented case of human to human
transmission of rabies anywhere in the world. It added that the person
poses no risk to other patients or to visitors. Both hospitals are
functioning normally and there is no risk to the provision of their
services. "All necessary steps on infection control are in place for the
protection of staff."

Rabies is a notifiable disease in Northern Ireland and there have been no
notifications of rabies in humans there since 1938. The board and its
partner agencies are taking national expert advice from the Health
Protection Agency and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency. It added: "The
board and its partner agencies are satisfied that all necessary steps to
protect public health are in place and again stress that any risk to the
community is negligible."

Patient awaits tests for rabies
-------------------------------
Further tests are being carried out to confirm whether a patient at a
hospital in Belfast has rabies. Initial tests were positive. The patient
had been abroad but began to feel unwell after they [the patient] had been
home for several months.

The Eastern Health Board said it was leading a multi-agency investigation
but stressed the risk to the wider community was "negligible".

The patient is being treated at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. The
board and its partner agencies are taking advice from the Health Protection
Agency and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency. Rabies is extremely rare in
the United Kingdom and there have only been 23 known cases since 1946. The
last known case of rabies in Northern Ireland was in 1938.

[These reports do not reveal the nature of the test employed to confirm the
preliminary diagnosis of rabies virus infection. Strangely the country (or
countries) of potential exposure of the patient to rabies virus infection
is/are not stated, nor is it certain that the patient had been bitten by a
potentially rabid animal.

According to the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)
website <http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/diseases/rabies.htm> it may take
several weeks or even a few years for people to show symptoms after getting
infected with rabies, but usually people start to show signs of the disease
one to 3 months after the virus infects them. The early signs of rabies can
be fever or headache, but this changes quickly to nervous system signs,
such as confusion, sleepiness, or agitation. Once someone with rabies
infection starts having these symptoms, that person usually does not survive.

Further information is awaited.
