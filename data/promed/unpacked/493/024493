Agri scientists warn farmers against yellow rust
------------------------------------------------
Agricultural scientists have warned farmers against yellow rust, an
infectious and windborne disease affecting wheat crops. Growth of the
infected plants is weakened and stunted which causes nearly 50 per cent
loss of production, Haryana Agricultural University's Dr RP Narwal said.

"Yellow rust develops rapidly when free moisture occurs and temperatures
range between 10-20 deg C [50-68 deg F]. Primarily this disease occurs in
wheat crop grown in cooler climates, which are generally associated with
higher elevations and northern latitudes. The leaves of infected crop
produce yellow coloured stripes," he said.

Cold weather unlikely to stop yellow rust outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Recent very low temperatures are unlikely to prevent early outbreaks of
yellow rust occurring this spring [2010], making spray timing and intervals
extremely important, crop experts agree.

While sporulation stops at temperatures below 0 deg C [32 deg F], yellow
rust mycelium can survive in the leaf until such time as temperatures rise
again, says Syngenta's Dave Ranner.

"January and February temperatures do determine rust risk and appearance
date," he accepts. "But although the brown rust risk is reduced by cold
winter temperatures, yellow rust is not so easily deterred. And in the
eastern counties and the Midlands, surprisingly we haven't had enough
frosts yet to reduce the yellow rust threat." [For example,] yellow rust
manages to survive the harsh Canadian winters.

Some 60 per cent of the wheat varieties in the ground this year [2010] are
susceptible to yellow rust, while 85 per cent of certified seed sown is
susceptible to some form of rust. The implications of snow cover aren't
fully understood. A degree of leaf death could help remove some yellow rust
infection, but it will be important to get some [fungicide] protection.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow leaf stripes
and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent. The disease
affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild
grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping
season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease management includes the
use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of
volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and are also
suspected to emerge in China. Monitoring programmes are important to
recognise these emerging new strains and it can be expected that they will
differ in national or regional significance, depending on the
susceptibility of preferred cereal varieties.

Leaf rust (or brown rust) also mentioned above is caused by the related _P.
recondita_. The 3rd important rust disease of cereals is stem rust caused
by _P. graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_.
