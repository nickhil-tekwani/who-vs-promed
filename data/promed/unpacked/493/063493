Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: airborne spread

Epidemiological comments
Foot and mouth disease virus type A was detected by ELISA at the Food Safety Risk Assessment and Analysis Scientific Center (SNCO) of Armenia.

On 15 Jan 2016, the strain was categorized by FGBI-ARRIAH as genotype VII.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; no vaccination no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[FMD A, topotype Asia-genotype VII continues to spread in the area (see ProMED-mail archive list below), now affecting Armenia. The current outbreak is located in the Province of Armavir near the border with Turkey. Armavir is a province in the western part of Armenia located in the Ararat valley, between Mount Ararat and Mount Aragats, and shares a 45-mile border with Turkey to the south and west https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armavir_Province.

FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype (strain) VII, is suspected to have originated in the Indian subcontinent and has recently been spreading in the Middle East. For its genotyping results, please refer to the web-site of WRLFMD as follows:
Turkey: http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2015/WRLMEG-2015-00019%20A%20Turkey%202015%20v2.pdf;
Saudi Arabia: http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2015/WRLFMD-2015-00029%20A%20Saudi%20Arabia%202015.pdf.

This virus strain has already been reported from cattle and sheep. The outbreak in swine, apparent from the Armenian report, may be indicative of this strain's invasive capacity and the rapid circulation in Turkey (where there is a significant wild boar population).

According to the "Foot-and-Mouth Disease Situation, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" monthly report, dated November 2015: "Recent outbreaks in Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been caused by closely related viruses in the type A/Asia/genotype VII category, which also appears to have spread from South Asia to the Middle East. These 2 events represent a significant risk to FMD-free countries in the region, notably the southwest and southeast of Europe" http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2015/November2015.pdf.

The need for a matching vaccine has been raised in previous postings. - Mods.CRD/AS
