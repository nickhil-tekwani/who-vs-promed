A deadly outbreak has sparked a warning to tourists after a dangerous infection known as Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) spread to hundreds of people in India leaving 19 dead, a watchdog has warned. The virus, which is in the same family as yellow fever and dengue fever, is believed to be spreading from an outbreak that started in 3 villages in Sindhudurg.

The report from watchdog Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare] said: "Between January 2016 and January 2018, laboratory tests confirmed 332 cases of the disease in the district, and 19 cases of that number were lethal. "The Indian authorities did not specify the incidence of the KFD in January 2018."

The dangerous virus is spread to humans by tick bites or in milk from infected animals. The report said: "Rospotrebnadzor is asking the public to take account of the information while planning trips to India."

The symptoms of the disease include a fever, severe headaches, and nosebleeds. Vomiting, tremors, and mental disturbances are also believed to be signs of KFD. State surveillance officer Pradeep Awate explained that nearby villages are being warned about how best to "ward off the disease."

He stated: "The virus has remained confined to Sindhudurg district so far. "We have been educating villagers about precautionary measures to ward off the disease." Roughly 50 000 people have been vaccinated in a desperate effort to stop the disease from spreading.

Mr Awate went on: "We aim to vaccinate 100 000 high-risk people, including farmers, cattle grazers, and others." KFD, also known as monkey fever, has previously occurred through the bodies of dead monkeys that were infected. Scientist Devendra Mourya declared that control measures have been implemented at "spots where money deaths have been reported."

He continued: "The tick-control measures initiated by state health authorities in KFD-affected villages and at spots where monkey deaths were reported to have helped to restrict KFD spread."

The country's state government have produced a tick repellent, known as procured dimethyl phthalate oil, and has delivered it to villagers as part of the struggle with the horrifying virus.

[Between January 2016 and January 2018, laboratory tests confirmed 332 cases of the disease in Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra, of which 19 cases were lethal, although the number of cases in January 2018 is not specified. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites, such as application of tick repellents on skin, wearing full sleeved clothes and long pants to reduce exposed skin, can help towards reducing the transmission of Kyasanur Forest disease. - Mod.UBA
