Paraguay's elite hit in worst dengue outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
A Supreme Court justice, soccer players and a senator have all come
down with dengue in Paraguay, as the worst outbreak in the country's
history hit the well-off as well as its usual victims among the poor.
On Friday [2 Mar 2007], a nurse who worked with the public health
service died after being hospitalized for dengue.
10 people have died, and more than 15 000 have been infected in the
last 2 months with the mosquito-born virus, which causes high fever,
headache, severe muscle and joint pain and, in its worst form,
potentially fatal internal bleeding.
Paraguay, which never had a dengue death before this outbreak, and
neighboring Brazil and Bolivia have declared health alerts as they
all fight major dengue outbreaks that could be linked to unusually
hot and rainy weather.
"We're really scared. Everyone is sick. This is chaos," said an herb
vendor in Asuncion, capital of the landlocked South American nation.
Some stores in Asuncion have run out of mosquito repellents;
citronella oil bracelets are all the rage, and radios are full of a
new song with lyrics about the dengue carrier: the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.
Doctors and health workers protested on Friday [2 Mar 2007] in front
of a government public health building, saying the government has
failed to fight the epidemic properly despite assigning USD 3.8
million in emergency money. Carrying signs with drawings of giant
mosquitoes and photos of health officials, the protesters demanded
Health Minister Oscar Martinez resign.
Dengue infections have increased 4-fold in the last 3 decades,
according to the World Health Organization. Most dengue is in
Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, but incidence and severity is
increasing rapidly in Latin America.
Dengue has expanded in the Americas since the 1970s, as the mosquito
that carries it hugely expanded its territory after governments
stopped large-scale eradication campaigns, according to the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control.

[The official Paraguay Ministry of Health reports of the numbers of
dengue cases conflict with the unofficial estimates noted in a recent
BBC report
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6407287.stm>. Clearly, a health
emergency exists in Paraguay, and neither official or unofficial
reports indicate that the peak of the epidemic has passed.
Extraordinary effort on the part of the health sector and by the
public will be required to quickly reduce the incidence of dengue
fever and DHF. ProMED thanks Joseph Dudley, who also provided the BBC
report as well as a report similar to this one.

Campo Grande [city] approves law to combat dengue
-----------------------------------------------
The city council of Campo Grande on Thu 1 Mar 2007 approved a law
that will facilitate the combat of dengue, which, since the beginning
of this year [2007] has afflicted 76 of the 78 municipal districts of
Mato Grosso do Sul [state]. In total, 53 146 [dengue] cases were
recorded in the state.
The new law ... obligates property owners to be responsible to
eliminate containers that can accumulate water so that the mosquito
_Aedes aegypti_ (the disease [virus] vector) will not proliferate.
According to the Executive Director of the Municipal Health
Secretariat, Salim Cheade, on Thursday [2 Mar 2007], the city is
facing the largest dengue epidemic in its history, with 27 300 cases
registered, a number greater than was registered in 2002, which
totaled nearly 21 000 cases.

A total of 2767 Central Java residents contracted dengue fever
between early this year and 16 Feb 2007, with the [numbers of] fatal
victims reaching 73 people, a provincial health official said.
In January 2007, the number of dengue patients in Central Java was
1461, and in February 2007, the figure increased by 1306, the head of
the Central Java provincial health office, Endang Agustinar, said on
Monday [19 Feb 2007].
The dengue outbreaks occurred in 7 districts, namely Blora, Pati,
Jepara, Pekalongan, Semarang, Pemalang, and Batang.
"The incidence of dengue fever is very much related to the rainy
season. It usually increases sharply during the rainy season when
there is a lot of stagnant water where _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes can
easily breed," he said.

Dengue cases in the country dropped by 20.9 percent over a one-week
period from last Saturday. The Health Ministry's Diseases Control
Director Datuk Dr Hasan Abdul Rahman said the drop was the result of
concerted efforts by the government and various parties to check the menace.
He said that during the period (18-24 Feb 2007), 783 suspected dengue
cases were reported, compared with 990 cases the preceding week, a
drop of 207 cases or by 20.9 percent. "In the same period, there were
2 dengue-related deaths, one each in Selangor and the Federal
Territory, bringing to 25 the total number of deaths due to dengue
this year [2007]," he said in a statement issued here Tuesday [27 Feb 2007].
Dr Hasan said that of the 783 cases, 729 cases or 93.1 percent were
suspected to be dengue fever, while 54 cases or 6.9 percent, [were]
dengue hemorrhagic fever [cases]. He said lesser dengue cases were
reported that week in all states except Penang and Terengganu and the
Federal Territory of Putrajaya.

[It is good to learn of a dengue epidemic that appears to be
subsiding, given so many increasing outbreaks in other parts of the
world. It would be interesting to know what mosquito vector control
measures have been implemented in the outbreak areas. A map of

The Department of Health (DOH) has already declared a year-round
campaign against the dreaded dengue fever, but cases, including
deaths, continue to climb. A DOH report showed that since 1 Jan to 26
Feb this year [2007], a total of 1579 dengue cases with 7 deaths were
recorded from all over the country.
The figure was 272 cases higher than the reported cases compared to
the department's previous report ending 13 Feb 2007. The number of
deaths also went up to 7, or an additional one death. However, the
DOH report showed that the dengue reported during the period is lower
than that of the same period in 2006, which was 3348 cases with 51 deaths.
The DOH report also showed the clustering of dengue cases, or 3 or
more cases, in a barangay [larger political-geographic subdivision
within a city] during the past 4 weeks in barangays Potrero and
Tonsuya in Malabon; Davao City; Bagua and Rosary Heights 8 in
Cotabato and in Poblacion in Bayuga, Agusan del Sur.
From a seasonal disease that breaks out only during the rainy
season, dengue fever has become a year-round disease. As early as
January [2007], epidemics of dengue were declared in Agusan del Sur
and in San Pedro, Laguna.
With the recent development, the DOH correspondingly launched an
all-out and year-round campaign against dengue that is aggressively
being undertaken in the barangay level and with the assistance of the
local government units. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier
said that the heightened awareness of dengue and community
participation would determine the success or failure of the battle
against the disease. Duque reminded the public that the only means to
fight dengue is to search out and destroy the breeding sites of
_Aedes aegypti_, the dengue-causing mosquitoes, and seek medical help
when early signs such as fever and rashes set in.

Health officials in the Cook Islands are trying to contain an
outbreak of dengue fever on Rarotonga.
So far, there have been almost 700 confirmed cases of the
mosquito-borne disease. A team of health, police, environmental
officers and local body officials have begun a national health
inspection program to educate people about the need to keep
properties cleared of mosquito breeding sites.
The Cook Islands Ministry of Health says there is an urgent need to
increase the number of inspections, as the disease is spreading quickly.

The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure.
The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature
accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific constitutional
symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days
and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile
convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all
signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In severe cases,
the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after a few days of
fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of circulatory
failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical state of
shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover following
appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality
may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
