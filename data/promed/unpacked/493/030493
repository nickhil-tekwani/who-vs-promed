[Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 518 cases and 7 deaths.

Daegu province and Gyeongbuk provinces continue to have reported the highest number of cases, 4693 and 984, respectively. Daegu is completely surrounded by Gyeongbuk province in the central eastern part of South Korea. Daegu has been the epicenter of this ongoing outbreak. While several provinces are at or approaching 100 cases (Gyeonggi: 120, Seoul 105, Busan 95, Chungnam 90), the rate of growth in numbers of daily new cases appears to be at a much slower pace than that seen in Daegu and Gyeongbuk.

C. Iran: 3513 cases, 107 deaths
Date: Thu 5 Mar 2020
Source: News Medical [abridged, edited]

Iran has the 3rd-highest number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths after China and Italy, the highest in Western Asia, and the 4th-highest number of SARS-CoV-2 cases, surpassed only by mainland China, South Korea, and Italy. The country reported its 1st COVID-19 case on 20 Feb 2020 [19 Feb 2020 according to our archive, 20200220.7009533. - Mod.SH]. Now, the government has imposed measures in the hopes of containing the virus after the sudden rise in confirmed cases and deaths.

Iran now has a staggering 3513 confirmed cases of COVID-19, while 107 of these patients have died. The rapid increase in cases is of concern since the country has long coped with a weak healthcare system. In line with the government's efforts to contain the spread of the virus in crowded jails, it has temporarily freed 54 000 prisoners. Iran's judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told reporters the inmates were permitted to go out of prison after testing negative for COVID-19 and posting bail. The health ministry will oversee the prisoner release, but it was unclear how the government will keep track of them. It is still unknown whether [N Z-R], the British-Iranian mother jailed in Iran for espionage charges, will be included among those released.

The country is now limiting travel between its major cities and has shut schools until April [2020]. Health minister Saeed Namaki said people should not use the break as an opportunity to travel. He also urged Iranians to reduce their use of paper banknotes.

The city of Qom has been the epicenter of the virus outbreak in the country. Since the spread of the virus in Qom and neighboring regions, the virus has reached around a dozen other countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. As Iran grapples with the outbreak its neighbors have been battling to stem the tide of both people and food across their borders from Iran. The countries near Iran fear that if the travel of people won't be limited or stopped temporarily, the spread of the virus will be inevitable. Since [25 Feb 2020], many countries in the Middle East have closed their air and land borders to Iran as the deadly coronavirus continues to spread, including Turkey, Iraq, Afghanistan, Armenia, and Pakistan, among others. Other regional countries such as Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Georgia, and Oman have imposed travel and immigration restrictions. The current crisis is posing a serious threat to Iran's economy. The country is struggling with how to sustain the economy despite the vast spread of the virus.

On [3 Mar 2020], the health ministry said that the number of confirmed cases had increased by more than 50 per cent for 2 consecutive days. As of writing, Iran reports 3513 confirmed cases of the virus. The death toll has reached 107, although the real figure is thought to be far higher. Iranian government officials have also contracted the virus, including the country's deputy health minister, who oversees the anti-coronavirus task force. The country's vice president is also fighting the infection.

Neighboring countries have reported confirmed cases linked to recent travel to Iran. Public gatherings, including Friday prayers in Tehran and other cities, have been suspended. The country has also started closing schools while cleaners were instructed to disinfect buses, trains, and public places.

With supplies running out and increasing consumer prices, residents find it hard to make ends meet. With a weakened economy and struggling government, the country is now striving to survive the worst outbreak it has experienced. Though Tehran has received assistance from China and the WHO to battle the coronavirus, the country still faces a huge predicament in stemming the rapid spread of COVID-19.

Qom, the apparent epicenter of this outbreak, is located to the south west of Tehran in central Iran. Other media reports have mentioned that Tehran has become a major focus of cases. According to the above report, all but 1 of the 31 provinces have reported cases.

[Among the 5 new countries reporting confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission in 3 occurred in Italy, (1 in Morocco or Italy), 1 in either the USA or India, and 1 is unspecified.

The unspecified transmission area involves hotel employees in Bethlehem (investigated after Greek tourists returned to Greece infected. Remembering the incident of the South Korean tourists from the evangelical sect that went to Israel and the West Bank for religious tourism and upon return to South Korea were identified as COVID-19 cases, one can't help but wonder if they had stayed in a hotel in Bethlehem and may have started the transmission chain there. This same group was the beginning of the major outbreak ongoing in South Korea. More information on the investigation in Bethlehem would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

Authorities also confirmed that cases have now been reported in all regions of mainland France -- although the highest numbers remain concentrated in 4 'cluster zones' -- Mulhouse in the Haut-Rhin department in eastern France, Oise in the north east (55 cases), Morbihan (20 cases) in Brittany, and Haute-Savoie in the Alps (44 cases).

A 5th cluster was a tour group that had travelled to Egypt, with 13 people testing positive for the infection.

Greek health officials on Thursday [5 Mar 2020] reported 21 new coronavirus infections [COVID-19] among a group that had recently traveled to Israel and Egypt by bus, raising the country's total to 31. "It was a closed group of people who were on a bus for several days," Sotiris Tsiodras of the national public health organization (EODY) told a news conference, adding that they had returned to Greece on [27 Feb 2020]. The group had been on a Holy Land trip to Israel and Egypt, EODY said.

Two among the group -- an elderly man and his wife -- had already tested positive as Greece's 9th and 10th cases, respectively. The 66 year old man has acute pneumonia and is in a stable condition, EODY said. Another 21 among the group were confirmed on Thursday [5 Mar 2020], Tsiodras said. He added that most of the patients are in good health and are being monitored at home.

Officials last night [4 Mar 2020] announced a 2-day school shutdown and a cancellation of public events in the areas in western Greece where the group had come from. The 2-day shutdown included "a suspension of all mass gatherings" at theaters, cinemas, museums, and sports events in the Peloponnese regions of Achaia and Elis and the island of Zakynthos through to Friday [6 Mar 2020].

Ancient Olympia, where the flame for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics is scheduled to be lit on [12 Mar 2020], is in Elis. The Greek Olympic Committee this week said it was limiting festivities and cancelling all event dinners and galas. The situation will be re-evaluated regularly, it added. The coronavirus outbreak has infected more than 95 000 people worldwide and killed over 3200.

Two people who traveled to the Philippines tested positive for coronavirus disease [COVID-19] after returning to Taiwan and Australia.

A man in his 30s went home to northern Taiwan on [3 Mar 2020] after a 5-day trip to the Philippines with his friends. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control reported that the man had diarrhea in the Philippines on [2 Mar 2020] and went to the clinic for dry throat and tiredness after returning to Taiwan. The man's COVID-19 infection was confirmed by a laboratory test on [5 Mar 2020], Taiwan CDC added. He is Taiwan's 44th confirmed case of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

Meanwhile, a woman who traveled from the Philippines tested positive for coronavirus disease in Australia. The woman in her 60s returned to the south eastern state of New South Wales from the Philippines on [3 Mar 2020] and is one of 6 new confirmed COVID-19 cases across the state's capital Sydney, the local government there reported. She boarded Cebu Pacific flight 5J39 from the Philippines, it added. "Her travel details are being obtained and will be disclosed if she posed a risk to any other passengers on her flight," read a statement posted Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] in the NSW government website.

With the new addition, the total number of COVID-19 cases in NSW has risen to 22, it added. Australia has at least 43 confirmed cases of COVID-19 based on the World Health Organization's tally.

There are no reported cases yet of local transmission in the Philippines. The 3 confirmed cases recorded were all Chinese nationals who came from Wuhan City in China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

- USA cruise ship

First, the food buffet was shut down as gloved staff scurried about wiping every surface in sight. Then the ocean liner's gym, bar, casino, and boutiques were closed, with passengers urged to keep to themselves. Finally, they were confined to their staterooms. Once the captain announced their vessel may be tainted with coronavirus, Grand Princess cruise ship guests were left with little to do but contemplate the prospect of extended isolation at sea, or worse.

[There are] some 2300 passengers stuck with about 1100 crew members aboard the Grand Princess, idled off the coast of California a day after the ship was denied entry to its home port in San Francisco. California governor Gavin Newsom insisted that the ship remain at sea until passengers and crew complaining of flu-like symptoms during a 15-day roundtrip cruise to Hawaii could be tested for possible coronavirus infection.

On Thursday [5 Mar 2020], the US Coast Guard airlifted a batch of diagnostic kits to the ship via helicopter, and public health officials said samples collected would be flown back to a San Francisco Bay Area state laboratory for testing. Results were expected in about 24 hours, said Mary Ellen Carroll, executive director of the city's Department of Emergency Management. State and local officials acted after learning that 35 people aboard the ship had fallen ill and that 2 passengers who had traveled on the same vessel for a voyage last month [February 2020] between San Francisco and Mexico later tested positive for coronavirus.

One, an elderly man from Placer County near Sacramento with underlying health conditions, died this week, marking the 1st documented coronavirus fatality in California. The other, from the Bay area, was described by Newsom as gravely sick. Health officials say both individuals likely contracted the virus while they were aboard the ocean liner, a corporate cousin of the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off Japan in February [2020] and was for a time the largest concentration of coronavirus cases outside China.

About 700 people aboard the Diamond Princess were ultimately infected with the virus and 6 have died in a crisis that experts have said was mismanaged by bureaucrats who failed to follow proper protocols.

The Princess cruise line, a unit of Carnival Corp, the world's largest cruise operator, said fewer than 100 passengers and crew from the Hawaii voyage of its Grand Princess have been identified for testing, including those who were ill. Tests will also be given to dozens of holdover passengers from the Mexico trip who stayed on the ship for the voyage to Hawaii, as well as "guests currently under care for respiratory illness," the cruise line said in a statement. They will remain quarantined on the ship until cleared by medical staff.

Specialists from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were working with local health authorities and the Coast Guard to coordinate the operation. They also were seeking to contact some 2500 passengers who disembarked in San Francisco on [21 Feb 2020] after the earlier cruise to Mexico. One of them, a Canadian woman from the province of Alberta, tested positive for the virus this week, health officials there said.

Princess Cruises has canceled the next scheduled departure of its Grand Princess Hawaii voyage from San Francisco, which had been set for [7 Mar 2020]. Passengers on the current cruise, meanwhile, were forced to make do with a rapidly shrinking choice of amusements. Having already lost access to many of the ship's favorite attractions -- the bar, casino, shops, food buffet, and gym -- guests were also urged to practice "social distancing", making an effort to keep at least 6 feet [2 m] away from strangers on the ship, the company said. By midday on Thursday [5 Mar 2020], they were asked to confine themselves to their staterooms until further notice.

It was unclear what would occur should anyone now aboard the ship test positive for the respiratory virus, which has infected more than 95 000 people worldwide, most of them in China, where the outbreak originated. "Once we have results from the tests, the CDC and the state will determine the most appropriate location for the ship to berth, and the location needs to provide for the safety of the surrounding community as well as the passengers and crew," Carroll told reporters on Thursday [5 Mar 2020]. She said the ship might be directed to an arrival point other than San Francisco.

The ship's captain is keeping passengers informed of developments throughout the day with announcements every couple of hours, and guests seem to be taking the uncertainty mostly in stride. "Hand-washing is a big deal," [a passenger] said, but "nobody is walking around sneezing or coughing."

[I have a déjà vu sense, remembering the saga of the Diamond Princess. Presumably, the intention is to begin with testing the "suspected" cases, (a headline said, "only 110 to be tested" and close contacts. Presumably, should there be confirmed cases, the net will be widened to test the entire passengers and crew. A delay in doing so was a major stumbling block in the management of the Diamond Princess cases. Clearly, once cases are identified, there will probably be more people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 during the stay onboard the boat. We await further information. - Mod.MPP]

B. France, situation update
Date: 5 Mar 2020

The number of coronavirus cases in France continued to rise as health authorities on Thursday [5 Mar 2020] confirmed a total of 423 cases since the outbreak began in January [2020] -- with 138 newly diagnosed in the past 24 hours. 3 more people died of the illness, including a 73 year old from the Oise department and a 64 year old originally from the nearby Aisne department. 23 of those infected with the virus were currently in a 'serious' condition, said French health chief Jérôme Salomon on Thursday [5 Mar 2020] evening during the government's evening press conference. "This is the time to protect our weakest," Salomon said, reiterating that the people who had died from the virus so far, were all elderly with "serious underlying conditions".

Salomon said France was currently experiencing a situation similar to that of its neighbour Italy, where 41 people had died in 24 hours bringing the death toll to 148. "The elderly must benefit from the solidarity of the whole country;" the health chief said and urged people to take the necessary precautions to contain the contagion. "We want to limit and delay the peak of the epidemic," Salomon said.

Authorities also confirmed that cases have now been reported in all regions of mainland France -- although the highest numbers remain concentrated in 4 'cluster zones' - Mulhouse in the Haut-Rhin department in eastern France, Oise in the north east (55 cases), Morbihan (20 cases) in Brittany, and Haute-Savoie in the Alps (44 cases). A 5th cluster was a tour group that had travelled to Egypt, with 13 people testing positive for the infection.

France is still in 'stage 2', according to French health authorities. But French president Emmanuel Macron said stage 3 -- a full-blown epidemic -- was "inevitable". Macron was meeting on Thursday [5 Mar 2020] with top researchers leading the efforts to fight an outbreak that has seen authorities close around 150 schools. France would reach stage 3 in 1 or 2 weeks, according to these specialists. "Slowing the spread will dampen the impact on the population when we go to level 3, and limit the epidemic's peak," the health ministry said.

Measures to contain the virus in France were stepped up this week. Public gatherings of more than 5000 people in enclosed spaces have been banned alongside all public gatherings in the worst affected departments. On Monday [2 Mar 2020] British Airways announced that it is cutting some of its flights to France. Public health announcements in a variety of languages are also being broadcast on public transport systems including the Metro.

On Thursday [5 Mar 2020], Paris metro operator RATP reported that a station agent had tested positive for the virus, and had worked for several days before being hospitalised. A RATP union official said the woman had taken part in an evangelical rally last month [February 2020] in the eastern city of Mulhouse (Haut-Rhin), where officials have said several other participants had come down with the disease.

Government spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye said it per today was "out of the question to postpone the upcoming municipal elections" on [15 and 22 Mar 2020]. "We will take the necessary precautions," Ndiaye said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] These measures could include distributing hand sanitiser at polling booths and avoiding crowded lines, Ndiaye said.

The Paris Marathon, which was due to take place on [5 Apr 2020], has reportedly been postponed until October [2020]. The Louvre museum, which had been closed since Sunday [1 Mar 2020], reopened its doors to visitors on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020]. In a press statement, the museum management said its "absolute priority" was to "ensure the security of its employees and visitors". The Paris Opéra on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020] asked people with "flu-like symptoms" to avoid both its venues, Garnier and Bastille, as a "precautionary measure".

French president Emmanuel Macron has cancelled his normal schedule to deal with the outbreak (and not, the Elysée Palace rushed to reassure people, because he has coronavirus himself). The total death toll in France now 7. An elderly Chinese tourist and a 60 year old French teacher also from the Compiègne area were the 1st 2 fatalities. Since then an 89 year old woman died at a hospital in Compiègne in northern France before the death of the 92 year old Brittany man brought the total to 4 before the 3 deaths were reported on Thursday [5 Mar 2020].

Germany has a similar number of cases to France but Italy is by the far the country in Europe most affected by the coronavirus outbreak after a huge surge in reported cases on Sunday [1 Mar 2020].

French ministers have also warned against all non-essential travel -- especially outside the EU -- and advised people in France to stop shaking hands and doing la bise (greeting with a kiss on each cheek) in an attempt to control the infection. But transport minister Elisabeth Borne said earlier this week that there was "no question of stopping trains from running" because of the virus.

The government has requisitioned the country's stocks of masks to distribute to health professionals and people self-isolating, in a bid to stop people from panic buying and creating shortages for those who need them. "Masks are indispensable in hospitals," health minister Véran said on Wednesday [4 Mar 2020]. But for people who were neither health workers nor contaminated by the virus, using masks was "pointless", Véran said. Fears of catching the virus have sparked a run on masks as well as sanitising hand gel in France, leading some stores and online retailers to hike prices. The price of hand sanitser has now been capped by government decree a €3 [USD 3.9] per 100ml.

[The media report above gives a nice summary of the current situation in France, and a well balanced alert that France may well follow the path of Italy. Media reports of imported cases with a history of travel from France are increasing on a daily basis, a circumstantial bit of evidence that transmission is ongoing and growing. All regions of the country are reporting cases.

Panic over the COVID-19 seems to be almost universal in most countries with social media feeding into it as well as sensationalist media and sensationalist politics. Reports of hoarding of supplies such as hand sanitizer and face masks with price gouging [exploitative price increases] are not just from France. A good check in your country is to go on Amazon and see the price of hand sanitizers, and face masks. Face masks are critical for PPE (personal protective equipment) used by health professionals and country supplies need to be maintained. Local hypermarkets are running out of stocks of basics including bottled water (what's wrong with tap water in many of these countries?). Shortages are manmade and feed into the panic. If only rational risk communication was consistently provided....sigh. - Mod.MPP]

C. Japan

Concerns are growing in Japan that the number of coronavirus cases could be higher than reported, with experts questioning the country's approach to testing as infection rates continue to climb. Japan has come under immense international scrutiny for its handling of the outbreak -- specifically over its quarantine of the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship in Yokohama Bay.

In neighboring South Korea, infections have surged dramatically, with more than 6000 confirmed cases after the government tested tens of thousands of people as part of a mass screening drive. But although the Japanese government says it has the capacity to carry out 3800 tests a day, only 8111 tests had been conducted as of [4 Mar 2020], according to the country's health ministry.

On Wednesday [4 Mar 2020], Japan recorded 33 new cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, its highest one-day increase since the outbreak began, according to numbers released by the health ministry. The overall total now stands at 1023, of which 706 are from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. But Japan's coronavirus figures are likely already much higher than reported, with the infection rate suspected to be just the "tip of the iceberg", according to Masahiro Kami, the executive director of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, a non-profit group.

Kami says for every 1 patient tested, there are many more who remain undiagnosed. But as most of these people are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms they don't go to a clinic to get checked out. Guidelines from the health ministry say people should get tested if they have cold-like symptoms, a fever of 37.5 deg Celsius [99.5 deg F], or experience extreme tiredness or breathing problems for 4 days or more. In the meantime, they should self-quarantine. Senior citizens or people with preexisting medical conditions that put them at higher risk should seek testing if they exhibit symptoms for 2 or more days, according to the guidelines. The advice was given to prevent people from inundating clinics and hospitals. But it has done little to soothe public anxiety or curb the spread of the virus.

In Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, the governor has declared a state of emergency. The popular tourist spot has been particularly hard hit, accounting for more than a quarter of all non-cruise ship related cases in the country. But while the official number of people infected with coronavirus in Hokkaido may now be in the 80s, the actual number is likely to be 10 times higher, said Hiroshi Nishiura, an epidemiologist at Hokkaido University. Nishiura, who is assisting the government in creating statistical models to help predict the spread of the virus, said the estimated figure is consistent with what he had seen in the Chinese city of Wuhan -- the epicenter of the outbreak.

Japan's health ministry, however, has so far refuted Nishiura's estimates. It suggested Japan is likely to have around 3000 coronavirus cases in total. "We understand there are people we have not detected," the ministry said in a statement provided to CNN. The ministry added it was aware "many people want to take the test" and that it would "expand the target range" to include people showing "mild symptoms." Irrespective of the total figure, it is likely the coronavirus infection rate will rise as more people are tested, said Kenji Shibuya director of the Institute for Population Health at King's College London, and a former chief of health policy at WHO.

In order to ease public anxiety, tests in Japan should become more widely available, with priority given to senior citizens, who are most at risk, said Shibuya. Though Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe has said he is considering the possibility of declaring a nationwide state of emergency that would grant more powers to local authorities to enforce a ban on public gatherings and encourage people to stay at home, Shibuya suggested the government should focus on preparing contingency plans in the event of a larger outbreak. According to Shibuya, it is important to treat those who are critically ill and protect those most at risk, as even asymptomatic people can pass the virus on to others.

Kami, of Japan's Medical Governance Research Institute, corroborated that view, noting that the most important thing is to prevent infections in old people in nursing homes, hospitals, and houses. "If senior citizens are infected they become seriously ill and their mortality rate (with the coronavirus) is more than 10%," said Kami.

The coronavirus has spread from China to more than 75 countries and regions, killing more than 3200 people and infecting more than 95 000 people globally. And as the outbreak casts a shadow over the economy and Tokyo's preparations to host the Summer Olympics, Abe has stressed that the next couple of weeks will be crucial in the battle to contain its spread.

Japan has already started to take a number of precautions to overcome and prevent the spread of the virus. Many large-scale public gatherings and sporting events have been scaled down or canceled. Japanese companies have also adopted the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and in offices.

Last week [week of 24 Feb 2020], a decision by most schools to shut down also sparked criticism, with many parents unsure of how they would cope in a country where nannies and domestic helpers are uncommon. As anxiety grew, many rushed out to stock up on goods such as toilet and tissue paper after an online rumor alleged that most of Japan's supplies came from China, where factories were shutting down. And with masks and hand sanitizer already in short supply, Shibuya said that panic poses a bigger threat than the virus itself.

"In the end, COVID-19 is a mild cold for the majority of people, the biggest fear is not the virus itself but the panic, which is happening unfortunately," said Shibuya.

[The purpose of posting this article is not to air criticism, but rather to demonstrate how common the story is for many countries. Many lessons are being learned. It is a new virus and there is only 2+ months experience with it. It seems to arrive in new locations through overt, obvious importations, with more serious cases but also arrives in a stealthy manner through importations that are transmitted unnoticed until suddenly a country recognizes a much bigger problem than they thought they had. The community transmission has been missed in a number of countries related to a lack of awareness of the need to test milder symptomatic individuals without an epidemiologic link to another case or country of known transmission. It has been seen in a number of European countries (and is ongoing right now in a number of European countries, it happened in Iran, it is currently happening in the USA). Given reported imported cases from Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, and Egypt, while local transmission hasn't been confirmed as yet, it is highly likely that local transmission is ongoing if returning travelers were infected.

Panic is a common response as seen in the report from France and in the report above. A counter-productive reaction, that produces more panic when store shelves are empty. Risk communication to the general public is critical in this setting. - Mod.MPP]

Highlights
----------
- Five countries/territories/areas (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Gibraltar, Hungary, Slovenia, and the occupied Palestinian Territory [West Bank]) have reported cases of COVID-19 for the first time in the past 24 hours.

- In anticipation of an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, the Southeast Asia Region is preparing to roll out rapid response activities by engaging with communities, procuring personal protective equipment (PPE), and ensuring laboratories have the capacity to test for COVID-19 or ship samples to global referral laboratories.

- The WHO director-general emphasized the importance of implementing a comprehensive approach to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. Educating the population, expanding surveillance, caring for patients, and strengthening preparedness systems are key to interrupting transmission. The WHO director-general's remarks can be found at https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-mission-briefing-on-covid-19---4-march-2020.

- WHO's initiative called the WHO Network for Information in Epidemics (EPIWIN) employs all communications platforms to amplify evidence-based information. EPI-WIN has identified trusted sources and engaged with these "trust chains". More information can be found in the Subject in Focus.

Subject in focus: infodemics
----------------------------
"Infodemics" are an excessive amount of information about a problem, which makes it difficult to identify a solution. Infodemics can spread misinformation, disinformation, and rumors during a health emergency. Infodemics can hamper an effective public health response and create confusion and distrust among people. To manage infodemics, WHO has developed an innovative communication initiative called the WHO Network for Information in Epidemics (EPI-WIN).

During emergencies demand for information is high, there are often many unknowns and people will seek information from sources and individuals and entities they trust. WHO, through EPI-WIN, has identified such trusted sources and engaged them not only as amplifiers of accurate, timely information but also as advisers on the kind of information that their constituents need and urgently want to see.

Information exchange takes place through regular engagement calls with these "trust chains". EPI-WIN employs all communications platforms available to it and partners with these trusted channels to amplify evidence-based information tailored to different audiences, answering pertinent questions as the event unfolds and linking them to additional response assets.

A "trust chain" with employers and employees -- the world of work Such a "trust chain" has been established around the world of work. Workers spend approximately 1/3 of their adult lives at work. Because of this, employers and businesses can serve as amplifiers of trusted information about COVID-19 for employees. Employers in both private and public sectors are asking how to protect their staff, contractors, and customers from COVID-19. Employees associations and trade unions are also seeking information on how WHO policies, guidance, and recommendations can be implemented in their workplace settings.

Working with the World Economic Forum, EPI-WIN has established networks with the key business sectors and public enterprises likely to be impacted by COVID-19 and future epidemics. These have been grouped into networks of Healthcare & Health Workers, Travel & Tourism, Food & Agriculture and International Mass Gatherings. Within each network, there are multi-national enterprises, professional associations and UN specialized bodies representing sectors that employ tens of millions of people and account for many billions of dollars in economic activity.

EPI-WIN is also working with WHO's Department of Occupational Safety and Health and their counterpart; global trade unions through the International Labor Organization (ILO)'s Bureau of Workers Activities (ACTRAV) and the International Trade Union Council (ITUC) which brings together affiliated trade union bodies that represent 210 million workers in 163 countries.

The engagement with trade unions has allowed many concerns to be raised around issues that could impact the effectiveness of public health policies and interventions aimed at containing the COVID-19 epidemic. These include issues such as infection prevention and rights of public-facing workers in health, social care, and retail sectors; safe staffing levels when sickness absences may lead to fewer workers facing potentially unsafe increases in workload; income protection for those isolated, self-isolating or requiring time off work because of school/transport closures; and discussions with employers on remote working and flexible working patterns. EPI-WIN also works closely with the WHO Health Workforce Department that collaborates with approximately 80 global healthworker associations.

This is just one example of a "trust chain". Others have been developed around healthcare workers, travel and tourism, faith-based organizations, large event organisers, and others. Please visit the EPI-WIN website for more information and to view advice (https://www.epi-win.com/).

Note: Numbers include both domestic and repatriated cases.
*Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
**Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

***"Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status
****Reduced from prior situation reports due to separation of territories, and Liechtenstein from Switzerland

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 84. This includes 9 countries from the Western Pacific region, 41 countries (including 1 territory) from the European region, 5 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 10 countries (including 2 territories) from the Americas region, and 3 countries from the African region. 31 countries are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Belgium, Belarus and Portugal newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission was also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess).

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 14 768 including 267 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. - Mod.MPP]
