A herd of sheep in Cyprus is not infected with foot and mouth disease
[FMD], agriculture minister Fotis Fotiou said, citing test results released
on Wednesday [31 Oct 2007] from a European Union laboratory in England.
"The tests do not confirm FMD; there is nothing for us to be concerned
about," Fotiou told the AP.

Last week, authorities cordoned off an area in south east Cyprus,
suspecting infection in a herd of 320 sheep in village of Dromolaxia.

Wednesday's [31 Oct 2007] results were greeted by relief from local
farmers, as 150 000 farm animals, including cows and pigs on dozens of
farms, would likely have been culled within a 10 km (6 mile) radius of an
infected herd.

Fotiou said the cull would have been a financial "disaster" for this tiny
island's farmers. The Cypriot samples were tested at the EU laboratory in
Weybridge [sic; should read Pirbright], England.

Cyprus on Wednesday [31 Oct 2007] said initial tests had failed to verify a
suspected outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] at a farm on the island.
Authorities have quarantined a farm in the south of the island after sheep
showed symptoms of the debilitating and highly contagious disease last week.

"The 1st indications we have from the laboratory is that it does not appear
to be FMD, but that does not mean it is the conclusive result," agriculture
minister Photis Photiou said.

Conclusive results were expected from Britain on Wednesday [31 Oct 2007]
afternoon, he said [and received by now: negative; see item 1 above. - Mod.AS].

Farmers say the sheep affected probably fell ill by consuming sumac, a
shrub which grows in the wild [see 3].

Claims by a spokesman for animal breeders that sheep were "stoned" on a
common herb and not suffering from suspected FMD were discounted yesterday
[30 Oct 2007] by a plant and herb expert on the island.

"FMD is so easy to detect that if the veterinary tests say it's FMD, then
it is," said Alexander McGowan. A spokesman for the animal breeders said on
Monday [29 Oct 2007] the sheep in question had simply eaten a herb known
locally as soumaji, which had certain side effects on the animals that the
authorities picked up on.

McGowan said sheep could suffer a form of drunkenness from eating soumaji
but said there was no correlation between the symptoms of that condition
and FMD.

Foot and mouth disease is characterized by high fever that declines rapidly
after 2 or 3 days, blisters inside the mouth that lead to excessive
secretion of stringy or foamy saliva and to drooling, and blisters on the
feet that may rupture and cause lameness. [The above description applies to
cattle; the clinical signs in sheep are milder and different: the 2 most
prominent changes are pyrexia and foot lesions expressed in mass occurrence
of lameness, while buccal lesions are mild and sometimes not seen. Severe
losses may be seen in offspring, with mortality -- caused by cardiac
failure -- sometimes exceeding 50 per cent. - Mod.AS]

Soumaji is part of the _Rhus_ family, a genus of about 250 species of
flowering plants commonly called sumac or sumach, and some species include
poison ivy and poison-oak. Sumac is used in Middle Eastern cuisine as a
spice, and the leaves contain tannin, which furthers the plant's use in the
leather dyeing industry. [Could this plant be, in fact, the terebinth, or
turpentine tree, _Pistacia terebinthus_ of the family _Anacardiaceae_
(sumac family) native to the Mediterranean region, which is a source of
tanning material and "Cyprian turpentine"? Information would be
appreciated. - Mod.AS]

McGowan said it was plentiful in the Paphos area, but he also said sheep
don't generally eat it. "Sheep are grazing animals and don't browse," he
said, meaning sheep mainly eat grass, while goats will eat from trees and
shrubs. He said, however, the sheep could eat sumac if it was on the
ground. "But it doesn't form part of their natural diet," he said. "You
don't see sheep leaping up trees." McGowan said the sheep could get
"stoned" if the berries they ate were fermented, just as elephants often
became "drunk" from eating fermented bananas.

"If the fruit falls off and they eat it, it could cause drunkenness in
sheep, depending on how fermented they were," he added. But this would not
cause the type of sores in the mouth and feet of the animals that is seen
with foot and mouth disease.

[Information on the clinical signs observed, on the tests locally applied
or on other reasons which have led the authorities to suspect FMD in the
sheep would enable lessons to be learned. It would also help to note which
samples were sent to Pirbright and which tests have been carried out there.

Cyprus, an island reportedly including about 61 500 head of cattle and 600
000 sheep and goats (OIE's WAHID data), has not experienced outbreaks of
FMD since 1964; vaccination is prohibited. The above figures do not include
animal populations in the island's Turkish-controlled territory.

The Cyprus sheep and goat industry has recently been confronting another
serious animal health problem. According to a recent ruling of the Court of
Justice of the European Communities, about 116 000 sheep and goats on 679
farms on the island are to be culled over scrapie fears. Following the
ruling of the Court of First Instance, the Representation of the European
Commission in Cyprus said: "The Commission plans to appeal this order by
the Court of First Instance to suspend the application of the regulation
pending the final Court judgment." For further details, see
