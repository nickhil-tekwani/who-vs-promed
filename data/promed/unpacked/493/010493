Influenza update no 217
-----------------------
Summary
-------
Globally influenza activity continues to increase in the southern hemisphere.

- In Europe and North America, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels.
- In eastern Asia, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels in most countries with influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B virus predominating. Influenza activity still continued in the south region of China mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) viruses.
- In Africa and western Asia, influenza activity was low.
- In the southern hemisphere, influenza activity continued to increase in most countries. In the temperate zone of South America influenza-like illness continued to increase, but was predominantly due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Influenza A(H3N2) was the most commonly detected influenza virus. In Australia and New Zealand, the influenza season seemed to have started with increased influenza-like illness and increasing number of influenza detections reported. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 the most commonly detected virus. In South Africa the influenza detection rate increased with influenza A(H3N2) the most frequently detected virus.

- Based on FluNet reporting (as of 11 Aug 2014, 10:00 UTC), during weeks 29 to 30 (13 Jul 2014 to 26 Jul 2014), National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 51 countries, areas or territories reported data. The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 16203 specimens. 1579 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1274 (80.6 percent) were typed as influenza A and 305 (19.3 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 426 (42.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 568 (57.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 21 (56.8 percent) belong to the B-Yamagata lineage and 16 (43.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

- For updates on human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus see the WHO website at http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/influenza_h7n9/

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America, Europe, Northern Africa, and the Western and Central Asia region
In the majority of the countries in the northern hemisphere, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.

Eastern Asia
In the eastern Asian region, influenza activity remained low with influenza A(H3N2) as the main virus in circulation with some influenza B also detected. In southern China, ILI [influenza-like illness] rates decreased slightly compared to previous weeks but were still high in comparison with previous years. The influenza virus detections reported were mostly influenza A(H3N2). In northern China, Japan, Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea, influenza activity reached inter-seasonal levels.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
Overall in this region, influenza activity remained low. An increased circulation of influenza B was observed in most countries of the Caribbean and Central America with influenza A co-circulation reported in Haiti (H3N2), Guatemala (A, not subtyped) and Panama (A(H1N1)pdm09).

Tropical countries of South America reported ILI and SARI [severe acute respiratory infections] activity within the expected range. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continued to predominate in most countries of the subregion but an increase in influenza activity was reported. Especially in the Plurinational State of Bolivia. This was mainly due to influenza A(H3N2) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses over the last few weeks. In Brazil, influenza A(H3N2) viruses were the most frequently detected viruses with most influenza activity occurring in the southern region.

Central African tropical region
In Africa, influenza activity reported from western, middle, and eastern Africa was at low levels.
Number of specimens positive for influenza by subtype in the African region

Tropical Asia
In most southern and South-Eastern Asian countries, activity declined or remained low.

In Lao People's Democratic republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam, influenza activity was low. Singapore reported higher numbers of influenza virus positive specimens, predominantly influenza B.

Bhutan, India, and Sri Lanka reported influenza activity with mostly influenza A(H3N2) virus detected.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
Temperate Zone of South America
In the temperate zone of South America, influenza activity continued to increase in some countries while it might have peaked already in others. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most detected influenza virus.

In Chile, ILI and SARI activity as well as number of influenza a virus detections, appeared to have peaked already. RSV accounted still for 72 percent of the positive respiratory samples followed by influenza (12 percent). The main circulating influenza virus was influenza A(H3N2).

In Argentina, ILI and SARI activity might have peaked already . Although the percentage positive for influenza is still increasing. ILI activity remained relatively low this season whereas SARI activity reached high levels (alert zone). From the 2780 samples processed in the last few weeks, 51.5 percent were positive for a respiratory virus and 11.9 percent were positive for influenza. Among the positive samples, RSV counted for 69.3 percent. Influenza A(H3N2) was the most frequent detected influenza virus.

In Paraguay, the ILI consultation rate increased compared to the previous week and reached high levels (alert zone). The proportion of SARI-associated hospitalizations decreased in the last weeks. The percentage of specimens positive for influenza virus increased further. Of the specimens testing positive for respiratory viruses during the last 3 weeks, 43 percent were positive for influenza A(H3N2), followed by 33 percent positive for RSV.

In Uruguay, in the last 3 weeks, the majority of the positive samples were RSV (73.5 percent). Among the positive influenza specimens, all were influenza A (H3N2).

In South Africa, influenza detection increased with influenza A(H3N2) dominating.

Oceania, Melanesia, and Polynesia
---------------------------------
In both Australia and New Zealand, ILI activity and the number of influenza detections increased. The main detected virus was influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In Australia ILI activity begun to show an increase during the last few weeks, however, overall activity remains consistent with the expected seasonal trend. The notification of laboratory confirmed cases continued to increase during the last few weeks. In New Zealand, the ILI consultation rate was slightly above the seasonal threshold, and remained below the New Zealand average epidemic curve. Out of 618 respiratory specimens tested, 231 (37 percent) were positive for influenza, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 the most frequently detected influenza virus.

In the Pacific Islands, ILI activity was variable with a decreasing trend observed in several islands. However, in American Samoa, Fiji, Kiribati, New Zealand, Niue, and Vanuatu ILI activity increased.

Update 217 confirms that the Southern Hemisphere seasonal influenza epidemic is well underway. No novel strains have appeared with variable predominance of existing types and with A(H3N2) predominating. Exceptionally, this update reports that in Chile respiratory syncytial virus accounted for 72 percent of the positive respiratory samples followed by influenza at only 12 percent. The main circulating influenza virus has been influenza A(H3N2). - Mod.CP]
