The following publication amplifies the initial reports of the
identification of human cases of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in the
Comoro Islands posted in 2007-8 (see archive references below).

English language Abstract of the publication entitled Emergence of
Rift Valley fever in Mayotte, 2007-2008
---------------------------------------
Background
----------
Epidemic resurgence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in 2006-2007 in Kenya
led to the implementation of an active laboratory-based animal
surveillance, and to the assessment of possible spread in the
population.

Methods
-------
RVF was investigated retrospectively and prospectively in serum
specimen collected from patients with dengue-like illness (DLI) who
consulted between 1 Sep 2007 and 31 May 2008 in any health centre in
Mayotte and tested negative for chikungunya, dengue, and malaria. A
confirmed recent case-patient was defined by the presence in the
serum of anti-RVF virus-IgM (MAC-ELISA [IgM antibody capture
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay]) or RVF virus-RNA (RT-PCR [reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction]).

Results
-------
A total of 10/220 (4.5 percent) patients were diagnosed with recent
RVF: RT-PCR (6), MAC-ELISA (2), or both (2). The earliest recorded
onset of DLI was 27 Sep 2007 while the latest was 14 May 2008. Seven
cases (70 percent) occurred between January and April 2008. Ages
ranged 16-53 years, and 9/10 (88 percent) were male. Neither severe
cases nor fatalities were observed. In patients (9/10), exposures to
animal products represented 5 out of 9 cases, consumption of raw milk
alone (1/9), breeding sites in the housing environment (3/9).
Phylogenic studies demonstrated that these strains are similar to
those circulated in Kenya in 1997.

Conclusion and discussion
-------------------------
This 1st recorded autochthonous transmission of the RVF in Mayotte
illustrates the risk of introduction or circulation in Mayotte of
arboviruses involved in outbreaks in neighboring Eastern-African
costal countries or islands. Efforts should be intensified and
maintained routinely in order to detect promptly any renewed
introduction or resurgence of RVFV in Mayotte.

[The Comoro Islands are an archipelago lying between Madagascar and
the African continent. The main islands are Grande Comore, Anjouan,
Moheli, and Mayotte. The islands are volcanic in origin. Politically,
the islands are divided into 2 entities: Comoros, a sovereign state,
and Mayotte, an overseas collective of France.

Mayotte can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=921810&v=-12.833,45.167,5>.

RVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with
RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated
with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients, the
illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or
hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead
to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (affecting the
eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized
weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset
of the illness. Typically, patients recover within 2 days to one week
after onset of illness.

The most common complication associated with RVF is inflammation of
the retina (a structure connecting the nerves of the eye to the
brain). As a result, approximately 1-10 percent of affected patients
may have some permanent vision loss. Approximately one percent of
humans that become infected with RVF die of the disease.

Case-fatality proportions are significantly higher for infected
animals. The most severe impact is observed in pregnant livestock
infected with RVF, which results in abortion of virtually 100 percent
of fetuses.

The source of these infections in Mayotte has not been determined but
it is likely that infection occurred by transmission from an infected
animal on the Comoros. The occurrence of RVF in animals in the Comoros
is possible because the islands lie in the Indian Ocean between the
RVF-endemic territories of Tanzania/Mozambique and northern Madagascar.

Tanzania suffered an RVF outbreak earlier in 2007; Madagascar is also
known to be endemically infected, as in 1982 a virus designated Zinga
virus, isolated in Madagascar, was identified subsequently by the WHO
Reference laboratory for Arboviruses in Yale to be RVF virus. - Mod.CP]
