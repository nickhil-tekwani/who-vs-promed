Influenza B causes higher death rates in children than the more common influenza A, according to a study from Canadian researchers published this week in Pediatrics.

The investigators analyzed data on 1510 children hospitalized with influenza B and 2645 children hospitalized with influenza A from 8 non-pandemic flu seasons from 2004 to 2013. Median age was young: 3.9 years for the former group and 2.0 for the latter.

The team found that 1.1 percent of the flu B and 0.4 percent of the flu A patients died, meaning that patients in the former group were almost 3 times more likely to die from their infection. Among healthy children with influenza B, those 10 years or older, compared with babies younger than 6 months, had an almost 6-fold greater risk of admission to an intensive care unit.

The researchers also determined that, compared with influenza A patients, influenza B patients were more likely to have a vaccine-indicated condition, and symptoms more often associated with influenza B were headache, abdominal pain, and muscle aches.

Influenza B accounts for a variable proportion of influenza cases each year. Over the last several decades, rates of hospitalization and mortality attributed to Influenza B have been lower than those associated with H3N2 subtype A, but they were higher than those linked to the less virulent seasonal H1N1 strains [1]. During the 2010-2011 season, 38 percent of all influenza associated pediatric deaths were attributed to influenza B, despite only 26 percent of all circulating viruses being of this type [2]. Half (49 percent) of these children who died had no known high-risk medical condition, and only 50 percent received any antiviral therapy, pointing to missed opportunities for intervention and prevention of complications.

Based on 2001-2011 surveillance data in the United States (excluding the 2009-2010 pandemic), the percentage of total clinical isolates attributed to influenza B ranged from under 1- 44 percent. In 5 of these 10 years, the predominant circulating B lineage differed from the World Health Organization recommended B lineage for the Northern hemisphere trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV), accounting for 77 percent to 98 percent of all influenza virus isolates [3].

Data regarding the burden of influenza B compared with A are critical to understanding the impact of various strategies of incorporating quadrivalent influenza vaccine into an influenza immunization program.
