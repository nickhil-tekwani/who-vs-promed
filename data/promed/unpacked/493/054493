Zambia's government on Friday [14 Sep 2007] warned citizens against
eating fish killed by a mysterious disease, after hundreds of them
were found dead on the Zambezi River in the western part of the country.
Agriculture Minister Ben Kapita told AFP that the government has
appointed a team of experts to investigate the outbreak of the
disease, which has killed several hundred sore-covered fish in the
river in recent weeks.
"We want to quickly find out the cause of the disease before the
situation gets out of hand," Kapita said.
The team would travel to western province to probe the cause of the
disease and establish whether it can be transmitted to humans, he said.
Several hundred dead fish with sores have been found in recent weeks
floating on the river by fishermen, Kapita said. He warned Zambians
to refrain from eating such fish until investigations were conducted.
A mysterious disease, which infected fish in parts of the Zambezi
River in nearby Namibia, also broke out last December [2006], forcing
the government to impose a 2-month ban on fishing to safeguard the
public. Scientists later found it to be epizootic ulcerative syndrome
(EUS). EUS-infected fish developed large sores and died.
The Zambezi River flows through 8 southern African countries.

[The described disease is, most probably, epizootic ulcerative
syndrome (EUS), which is clinically characterized by necrotizing
ulcerative lesions typically leading to a granulomatous response.
EUS, a seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and
farmed freshwater and estuarine fish, is a fungal disease considered
to be an infection with an oomycete known as _Aphanomyces invadans_
or _A. piscicida_. EUS has been recently identified in the Zambezi
river; see 20070718.2301.
ProMED-mail requested information on the outcome of investigations
into the fish mortality in Zambia on 29 Jul 2007; the request is
hereby repeated. - Mod.AS]
