reported cases of gastrointestinal disease over an extended
period, and inquired about a potential role for Clostridium

There are several excellent resources re: foodborne illness.
The FDA has a web page at:
http://vm.cfsan.fda.gov/list.html
A good text with reference to many bacterial illnesses, including
Clostridium perfringens:
Bacterial Infections of Humans:epidemiology and control--2nd ed
ed. by Alfred Evans and Philip Brachman
Plenum Medical Book Co
1991
An outbreak of Clostridium perfringens that lasted a month would be
unusual in my experience. It would require consistently poor
foodhandling practices.

What toxin type was the C. perfringens? We see acute and chronic diarrheas
in animals associated with overgrowth of perfringens:
horses:
-neonatal enterotoxemia due to types B and C
-adult "equine intestinal clostridiosis" due to an overgrowth
of type A
-anterior enteritis=duodenitis/proximal jejunitis
due to perfringens type A
dogs: *
-acute hemorrhagic enteritis due to overgrowth of
perfringens type A
ruminants:
-many syndromes due to perfringens types A, C, D
*The syndrome in dogs in relatively "new" and is seen in veterinary
clinics/hospitals (usually observed within 48 hr of discharge from the
hospital). The syndrome probably results from an overgrowth of type A in
the upper small bowel. What precipitates this? ... there are probably a
number of plausible contributing factors: a change in diet; withholding
food or water because of treatments; surgery; antimicrobial therapy, etc.
We can always see large numbers of short, fat, sporulating gram positive
rods on gram stain of stool, also they always have detectable levels of
enterotoxin, and we can easily grow large numbers of C. perfringens. I
don't know how this relates to your patients' disease, but could their
environment also set them up for overgrowth upsets of the bowel?
We feel that since C. perfringens is "normal flora" in all of these
species that the quantitative detection of perfringens growth is important
in working up these cases. Also, I would like to note that in "normal"
non-diarrheic animals we do not detect enterotoxin such as is produced by
perfringens type A.
