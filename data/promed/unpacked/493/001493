A potentially deadly horse virus has forced officials to cancel this
weekend's American Grand Prix Association (AGA) National Championship at
the Palm Beach Polo Equestrian Club.
The AGA event, part of the $100 000 Stadium Jumping Christmas Festival
scheduled for Friday and Sunday, was limited to 30 invited riders and
horses including Margie Engle, McLain Ward, and defending champion Jaime
Guerra.
According to a show official, 4 horses already have died, including veteran
rider Debbie Stephens' horse Cosequin's CEO on Sunday. Three farms in the
Grand Prix Village, located next to the showgrounds, are in complete lockdown.
Early unconfirmed reports from several officials and riders suspect the
virus to be EHV-1, Equine Rhinopneumonitis, more commonly known as equine
herpesvirus. Official blood tests have not been returned to the Palm Beach
Equine Clinic.
"[Cosequin's CEO] was at Dr Hayes Stevens' clinic and I wanted to commend
[him] and his team for doing everything they could to save him," Stephens
wrote in an e-mail.
There is no cure for the disease. Quarantine is the most effective strategy
once an outbreak occurs. The virus has a wide range of symptoms from
respiratory problems and fever, to pregnant horses aborting fetuses and
paralysis.
"Safeguarding the horses in our community and the protection of the
equestrian industry in Wellington is our utmost and primary concern," said
Stadium Jumping Inc. President Gene Mische. "We would much rather prefer to
err on the side of caution than put even a single horse at risk."
Until the disease is confirmed and contained, it's not known how
far-reaching the effects, if any, will be to the billion-dollar horse show
industry and future events including the Winter Equestrian Festival,
scheduled to begin in late January 2007.
