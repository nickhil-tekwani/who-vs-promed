A human case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been confirmed in a woman in the United Kingdom. She was diagnosed with CCHF at an unknown hospital at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, having recently returned from Central Asia. The country she had recently travelled to, or whether she visited multiple countries, is currently unknown. She has since been moved to the Royal Free Hospital in London and is receiving specialist care.

Transmission of the CCHF virus can occur via direct contact with infected tissue or via bites from infected hyalomma ticks, which are not established in the UK. The risk to the public is estimated to be 'very low' according to chief medical advisor of the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), Dr Susan Hopkins, with contacts of the case being traced, assessed and given advice.

[ProMED thanks Sam Pritchard for sharing this report on a CCHF case identified in the United Kingdom. We also thank others who informed us but wished not to be named. The UK Government webpage has the following additional information (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever-case-identified-in-england-following-travel-to-central-asia):

"Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical advisor at UKHSA, said: 'It's important to be aware that CCHF is usually spread by tick bites in countries where the disease is endemic; it does not spread easily between people and the overall risk to the public is very low. We are working with NHS EI to contact the individuals who have had close contact with the case prior to confirmation of their infection, to assess them as necessary and provide advice. UKHSA and the NHS have well-established and robust infection control procedures for dealing with cases of imported infectious disease and these will be strictly followed.'

"Dr Sir Michael Jacobs, consultant in infectious diseases at the Royal Free London, said: 'The Royal Free Hospital is a specialist centre for treating patients with viral infections such as CCHF. Our high level isolation unit is run by an expert team of doctors, nurses, therapists and laboratory staff and is designed to ensure we can safely treat patients with these kind of infections.'

"Prior to this case, there have been 2 cases of CCHF imported to the UK, in 2012 and one in 2014. There was no evidence of onward transmission from either of these cases."

The above case has history of travel to central Asia, although the exact travel destinations are not mentioned in the above update; we know that CCHF virus is endemic in Tajikistan and Central Asia and affects those who work primarily with livestock or within the agricultural sector (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23754931.2016.1250669). In addition, CCHF is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in the former Soviet Union, throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/crimean-congo/pdf/factsheet.pdf). - Mod.UBA
