Since Australia was declared free of endemic malaria in 1981 there
have been two reports (describing 7 patients) of introduced malaria
occurring in Far North Queensland. In 1986 5 patients were described
from the Cape Tribulation area, 100 km north of Cairns, and in 1996 a
single patient was reported from a remote settlement 450 km northwest
of Cairns. The references are:
Brookes DL et al. Plasmodium vivax malaria acquired in Far North
Queensland. Med J. Aust. 1996 166(2):82- 83.
Walker J. The Role of a Diagnostic Reference Laboratory in Malaria
surveillance. Comm. Dis. Intell. 1996 20(13): 302-304
The Torres Strait Islands (between New Guinea and Cape York)
also have had cases of introduced malaria but no indigenous malaria.
