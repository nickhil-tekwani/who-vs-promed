RABBIT HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE VIRUS - USA (INDIANA) (02)

There are some points in the comments of the editor about rabbit
hemorrhagic disease that, in our experience, seem to be not fully correct,
and therefore, we would like to clarify them.
1) There is no definitive proof that a rabbit surviving the disease can act
as a carrier of the virus for 4 weeks. If an animal is able to survive
(5-25 percent of the infected), it is because there was a quick and
efficient immune response. After 5-6 days post infection, a consistent
immune response can be observed; no more viral circulating particles will
be detected in the bloodstream using traditional diagnostic tests (i.e.
ELISA), and the residual virions can be detected in a complex form only in
the liver and spleen. What is surely true is that the virus is highly
resistant in the environment and can persist at an infectious level for a
very long time (several months). Therefore, even convalescent rabbits can
act as vectors of the disease if, for example, their fur had been
contaminated during the acute phase of the disease.
2) It is true that there is no specific treatment, but the use of
hyper-immune serum in the initial phases of the disease can stop the
infection. This is due to the fact that humoral immunity is most important
in protecting rabbits from infection.
3) For the same reason, vaccination is absolutely effective in preventing
both the infection and the disease. If animals are correctly vaccinated,
there is no infection at all, and the virus is fully neutralized. In our
experience, by applying a regular and correct vaccination plan, it is
possible to prevent the diffusion of the disease in industrial farms, and
it is also possible to obtain a full eradication in those infected units.
Therefore, we believe that the "carrier" status of vaccinated/infected
rabbits does not exist.
4) Indeed, it could be important and interesting to determine which viral
strain is responsible for the outbreak and to check whether the available
vaccine has been prepared with the same strain. In fact, it is known that
there is at least one major antigenic variant of the virus -- called RHDVa
(Capucci L., Fallacara F., Grazioli S., Lavazza A., Pacciarini L., Brocchi
E. A further step in the evolution of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus: the
appearance of the first consistent antigenic variant. Virus Research, 1998,
58,115-126) -- that indeed was also responsible for the 1st outbreak in USA
in 2000. This viral variant present some major antigenic changes in
neutralizing epitopes, and therefore, even if there is quite a good level
of cross immunity induced by the "classical" vaccine, the overall level of
protection could be lower.
We hope that, with this short note, we have clarified some aspects of the
disease.

[We appreciate The OIE reference laboratory clarifying these issues. Most
of the comments from the previous ProMED-mail post were pulled directly
from the USDA website:
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_ahrabbithd.html>,
and it was clearly stated in the moderator's comment. What is especially
interesting is that the OIE laboratory clarifies how the contaminated fur
of a convalescing rabbit may be the source of infection for other rabbits.
The USDA website does not make that clarification.
The vaccine mentioned above does not appear to have approval in the USA. -
