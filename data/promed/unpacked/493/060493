[There are prior OIE reports of outbreaks in Benin (Boukoumbe) in 2009 and 2007. Benin has yet to report to Paris on the 2012 outbreak. Being so close to the border with Togo, we can assume that it shares many epidemiologic factors in common with that country.

The location of the outbreak is in the commune of Boukoumbe in the region of Atacora in the northern part of the country near the border with Togo.

It is a stone's throw from the Togo border.
