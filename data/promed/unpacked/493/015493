A chickenpox outbreak at Daybreak Primary School in Battle Ground, [Washington], will keep some students home effective Monday [22 Oct 2018]. There are 5 confirmed cases of varicella at the campus, Battle Ground Public Schools spokeswoman Rita Sanders said Friday [19 Oct 2018].

Clark County Public Health requires that students and staff who do not have documented immunity against the virus must stay home for 3 weeks beginning Monday [22 Oct 2018], according to a letter sent to parents on Thursday night [18 Oct 2018]. Individuals who get a vaccine or provide proof of immunity can return before then.

That's expected to keep 38 students out of class, Sanders said. There are 541 students at Daybreak Primary School.

A higher percentage of students are exempt from vaccines at the north-county school than the county and state as a whole, according to the most recent data from the Department of Health. In the 2017-2018 school year, 13.2 percent of students were exempted from at least one vaccine. The majority, 11 percent, fell under the broad umbrella of personal vaccine exemptions. For varicella specifically, 11.4 percent of students were exempt from the vaccine.

Across Clark County, 7.5 percent of students are vaccine-exempt, 5.9 percent have personal exemptions, and 6 percent are exempt for the varicella vaccine. Statewide, the numbers are smaller still: 4.9 percent total, 3.7 percent personal, and 3.7 percent for varicella.

Families and staff can provide proof of vaccination by providing the district any of the following:

- Proof of date of birth before 1980
- Record of at least one dose of the chickenpox vaccine verified by a licensed healthcare provider
- A letter from a licensed healthcare provider documenting infection with and full recovery from previous chickenpox illness
- A letter from a licensed healthcare provider that confirms a blood test or serology showing chickenpox immunity.

Chickenpox is caused by the highly contagious varicella zoster virus, according to Clark County Public Health. The illness is marked by an itchy rash with pink spots and tiny fluid-filled blisters, the eponymous pox. The average infected person develops between 300 and 400 pox on their body. An infected person may also have a fever and be generally fatigued. The illness can be spread through secretions like saliva, contact with a pox, or through the respiratory system.

Families who believe their child is ill with chickenpox are asked to inform the school and seek medical care.

[Chickenpox is normally a mild disease, but it can be serious and can lead to complications or death, especially in high-risk people. Complications include bacterial infections of the skin, soft tissues, bones, joints, or bloodstream (sepsis); dehydration; pneumonia; inflammation of the brain (encephalitis); toxic shock syndrome; and Reye's syndrome for people who take aspirin during chickenpox.

Who's at risk?
Those at high risk of having complications from chickenpox include newborns and infants whose mothers never had chickenpox or the vaccine; adults; pregnant women who haven't had chickenpox; people whose immune systems are impaired by medication, such as chemotherapy, or another disease, such as cancer or HIV; people who are taking steroid medications for another disease or condition, such as children with asthma; and people taking drugs that suppress their immune systems (excerpted from https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chickenpox/symptoms-causes/syc-20351282).

For these reasons, chicken pox parties are not advised. Vaccination according to protocol is the best and safest preventative measure. - Mod.LK
