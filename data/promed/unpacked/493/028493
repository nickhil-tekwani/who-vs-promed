Two months after one gay man was diagnosed with invasive meningococcal disease, 8 new cases have emerged in Los Angeles and Orange County. One has died from the illness.

At least 6 cases were caused by the same strain of meningococcal bacteria, leading health officials to call this more seriously an "outbreak" rather than a less concerning "cluster."

Three of the 4 cases occurred within the past 6 weeks. Men who have sex with men are being urged to get a meningitis vaccination. It is not clear why the health alert has only now been issued.

Four of the 9 cases were among men who live in LA County, while the 5 additional cases were reported by Orange County. "This represents an increase above the typical number of reported cases," the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said.

Several outbreaks and clusters of meningococcal disease among gay and bisexual men have been reported in New York City, Los Angeles County and Chicago since 2013, they added. The outbreak in New York in 2013 generated new concerns about an AIDS-like virus. A total of 22 men were infected there from 2010 to 2013, and 7 of them died. Three people from Los Angeles and San Diego counties died of the disease in 2014, out of a total of 11 confirmed cases. Outbreaks have also recently been reported, primarily among people [who] were HIV-positive.

People with HIV are more susceptible to meningococcal disease. The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended this week that all HIV patients routinely receive meningococcal vaccines.

"We are concerned that gay and bisexual men in Southern California may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease," state public health officer Dr. Karen Smith said in a statement. "We encourage men who partner with other men to be aware of the risk of meningococcal disease and consider getting vaccinated."

Invasive meningococcal disease is a bacterial infection that develops quickly and can lead to meningitis and sepsis, health officials say. If not treated quickly, meningitis can cause permanent hearing loss, brain damage or even death.

The disease, which is fatal in about one in 10 patients, is spread by close contact with an infected person. It can be easily transmitted by kissing, through unprotected oral or anal sex and even by close proximity to an infected person who is sneezing and coughing. Even sharing a cigarette with an infected person is a risk factor.

Symptoms begin within days of infection and include fever, vomiting, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, rash and generalized muscle pains.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation urged Los Angeles County health officials on Friday [25 Jun 2016] to develop a public information campaign, supply vaccines, and work with community partners to avoid more deaths.

"We are calling on L.A. County Health officials to immediately roll out an aggressive, high profile and targeted public information campaign about this latest meningitis outbreak," said Michael Weinstein, president of AHF. "We urge Los Angeles County and other affected health jurisdictions to quickly ramp up their supplies of vaccines and partner with the community in vaccination efforts as well as educating the community.

"We are ready and willing to partner with the county in vaccine and prevention efforts and will try to make vaccines available at our Southern California area AHF Wellness Centers next week," Weinstein added. AHF is providing vaccines.

In April of 2014, AHF and West Hollywood City Councilman John Duran pressed health agencies to sound the alarm more directly and earlier to the gay community.

Nine cases of meningococcal disease have been detected in men in Orange and Los Angeles counties since May [2016], including in one Orange County patient who died from the infection, health officials said Friday [24 Jun 2016].

In an advisory, the California Department of Public Health warned that the outbreak of the rare disease primarily shows up in adult gay and bisexual men, and that people with HIV are at particular risk.

It can cause meningitis and bloodstream infections, said Dr. Matt Zahn, medical director of epidemiology and assessment at the Orange County Health Care Agency. "It's a vaccine-preventable disease," he said. "So, if a person is HIV positive or is a man who has sex with other men, it is important that he gets the vaccine."

One in 10 people die from meningococcal disease, Zahn said. "This is a sobering statistic because it hasn't changed even with improving medical care and treatment," he said.

The outbreak is among several clusters reported among gay and bisexual men in New York City, Chicago and Southern California in the past 2 years.

Symptoms of meningococcal disease may include fever, vomiting, severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, rash and muscle pain. Symptoms generally appear within a few days of exposure. The CDPH advised anyone who experiences these symptoms to get medical treatment immediately.

State health officials said those infected with HIV and gay and bisexual men who may be at increased risk for meningococcal disease -- those with multiple partners, smokers, drug users, or who regularly frequent crowded venues -- get the MenACWY vaccine.

[Outbreaks of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) have recently occurred among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Germany, Belgium and France caused by a _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup C strain with the same multilocus sequence type (http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/rapid-risk-assessment-invasive-meningococcal-disease-among-MSM.pdf). This genotype has also caused IMD in individuals (women, as well as those men who do not identify as MSM) who attended social venues associated with the gay community in France (http://www.eurosurveillance.org/images/dynamic/EE/V20N03/art21016.pdf). Similar outbreaks among MSM occurred in Canada and the US caused by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup C (see prior ProMED-mail posts).

The news reports above say that at least 6 of the 9 male patients with IMD in Orange and Los Angeles counties since May 2016 were caused by the "same strain of meningococcal bacteria" and that 4 occurred in LA County residents, while 5 were in Orange County residents; they do not state what proportion of the 9 cases were MSM or have HIV infection, what serotypes are involved, nor whether molecular typing has been done on the current strains and, if so, whether these strains are related to the prior U.S. or the European, Canadian strains. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information on the serogroup and molecular characteristics of the strains involved in the current Orange and LA County outbreak.

Severely immunosuppressed patients with HIV infection and a low CD4 cell count of less than or equal to 200/mm^3 are likely to be at greater risk of developing bacterial meningitis (Domingo P, Suarez-Lozano I, Torres F, et al. Bacterial meningitis in HIV-1-infected patients in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2009; 51(5): 582-7; available at: http://www.researchgate.net/publication/26279285_Bacterial_meningitis_in_HIV-1-infected_patients_in_the_era_of_highly_active_antiretroviral_therapy).

Orange County, located south of Los Angeles County along the Pacific Coast in southern California, with a population of about 3 million residents in 2010, is the 3rd most populous county in California, behind Los Angeles and San Diego counties, and the 6th-most populous county in the U.S. It is home to such attractions as Disneyland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California). Los Angeles County, with a population of 9 818 605, is the most populous county in the United States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California). The county seat is the city of Los Angeles, the largest city in California and the 2nd-largest city in the United States.
