The Health Authorities of the Department of Huila are in a state of alert due to an outbreak of hepatitis A and of dengue fever. The Departmental Secretary of Health, Emma Constanza Sastoque, stated that outbreaks of hepatitis A and dengue have occurred in Huila and may worsen coffee worker unemployment.

The Health official said that last week they initiated a mobilization of workers in the villages of Majo, Jagualito, and La Laguna de Garzon where 7 confirmed and 31 suspected cases of hepatitis A virus infection have been reported.

"It is important to boil water used for consumption; [this is] the principal recommendation," advised the health official, who sent a team from the Departmental Secretariat of Health to monitor the ongoing situation in Huila.

[The outbreaks of hepatitis A virus infection and dengue virus infection are coincidental, the 1st being water and/or food borne and the latter vector-borne.

Hepatitis A virus infection is a vaccine-preventable disease. However, in most situations, the transmission of hepatitis A virus can be prevented effectively by provision of clean drinking water together with efficient arrangements for disposal of sewage. In Huila, it is likely that the later procedures will be the most cost-effective.
