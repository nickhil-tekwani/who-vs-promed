[1] Cholera: Somalia, drought, vaccination program

http://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/stepping-up-humanitarian-operations-for-drought-cholera-vaccination-campaign-rolled-out-to-protect-over-900-000-somalis-in-drought-affected-districts.html


On 14 Jun 2022, Somalia rolled out the 1st round of a 5-day campaign to vaccinate 934 511 people against cholera in 9 high-risk districts that are currently facing ongoing outbreaks of cholera. The WHO and UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) are supporting the Ministry of Health and Human Services, Federal Government of Somalia, to conduct the campaign. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is providing vaccines and funds to implement this life-saving intervention. The oral cholera vaccination campaign aims to vaccinate people above one year of age, including pregnant women and internally displaced persons. It will be conducted in Hodan, Daynile, Dharkeneley, Wadajir, Jowhar, Baidoa, Afgoi, Wanlaweyne, and Marka districts.

Since 2017, Somalia has witnessed several cholera outbreaks. These can be attributed to a large number of people having poor access to safe water and sanitation services, and natural hazards, including drought and floods, further exacerbated by protracted conflict and large-scale population displacement. Meanwhile, the ongoing drought in the country has had a grave impact on Somalis: while displacing over 770 000 people internally, it has dried up surface water sources and led to food insecurity in communities, which increases the risk of cholera infection as well as other waterborne diseases.

An estimated 49% of the population -- 7.7 million people -- require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance in Somalia, of whom 6.13 million are estimated to be affected by the current drought.

While cholera remains endemic in Somalia, and the current drought situation may have exacerbated the risk of a major outbreak across the country, vaccination against cholera with 2 doses given between 2 to 4 weeks apart is seen as a supplementary measure to stop the outbreak and control its spread. In addition, other proven and effective public health measures also prevent cholera transmission, such as maintaining good personal hygiene, improving access to safe water, and practicing safe sanitation.

"To prevent cholera outbreaks in a sustainable way, we strongly advise affected communities to take 2 doses of cholera vaccine orally. In addition, we are urging our partners to assist us in improving access to water, sanitation, and hygiene facilities for vulnerable communities and the general public," said H.E. Fawziya Abikar Nur, Minister of Health and Human Services, Federal Government of Somalia.

"While we need to step up our collective response to cholera and other waterborne diseases, especially in the areas of case management, we have over 2100 community health workers deployed in 78 districts, including in 24 drought-affected districts. They are carrying out risk communication activities at the household level to promote safe behavioral practices and maintain basic hygiene at personal and household level even in these trying conditions. These community health workers are also ensuring that sick children with profuse diarrhea and vomiting and other signs of dehydration are immediately cared for and referred to nearly health centres for further assessment or treatment. These public health actions are saving lives from preventable causes, as populations, especially children, are very vulnerable during these emergencies, owing to hunger, starvation, and malnutrition," added Dr Mamunur Rahman Malik, WHO Representative to Somalia.

"Parents and caregivers can take life-saving preventive measures for their children by taking them to get the cholera vaccine drops. Children are very susceptible to preventable diseases like cholera, especially with low access to water during this drought," said Angela Kearney, UNICEF Somalia Representative.

"Together, we are ensuring that 1 869 022 doses of the cholera vaccines are readily available for the campaign while social mobilizers educate affected communities. Vaccination alone is not enough; preventive measures such as good hygiene and access to health care are important."

As of 15 May 2022, 4887 suspected cases of cholera, with 16 associated deaths, had been reported from 21 drought-affected districts in Somalia. Around 62% of these cases were children aged below 5 years, while around half of the cases were females.

A 2nd round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign will be conducted within a few weeks following completion of the 1st round of the oral cholera vaccination campaign. The populations that received the 1st dose will be targeted to receive the 2nd dose during the next round of the campaign to boost the affected population's immunity.

[2] Cholera: Mozambique (Zambézia)

Health authorities in the province of Zambézia, in central Mozambique, have registered 139 cases of cholera since the announcement, in May [2022], of the outbreak of the disease in the city of Quelimane, with no deaths, announced an official source.

"As of Friday [10 Jun 2022] we had a cumulative 139 cases in Quelimane," said Isaías Marcos, head of health services in Zambézia, quoted by the Mozambican Information Agency (AIM). According to the official, 134 patients were discharged from hospital, and 5 are still hospitalized, and should also be discharged.

Isaías Marcos also warned of the occurrence of other diarrheal diseases, calling for preventive measures to be taken, including "correct handwashing, promotion of community cleaning days, and combating open defecation. A redoubled effort is needed to contain the spread of waterborne diseases", he stressed.

In May [2022], health authorities in Zambézia declared an outbreak of cholera in Quelimane, the provincial capital, after 3 years without the disease.

Cholera is a disease that causes severe diarrhea, which is treatable, but which can cause death from dehydration if not promptly addressed, being caused, in large part, by the ingestion of food and water contaminated by lack of sanitation networks.

More than 150 people have died during a resurgence of cholera in Cameroon over the last 8 months, the UN said on Monday [13 Jun 2022]."The health ministry registered 8241 cases and 154 deaths," to the end of May [2022], the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said. Seven of the West African nation's 10 regions have reported cholera cases.

The worst-hit is the English-speaking Southwest with 5628 cases and 90 deaths, followed by the Littoral with 2208 cases and 58 deaths, OCHA said. Access to the Southwest "remains difficult" after years of violence between anglophone separatists and the army, said OCHA's Cameroon office head Karen Perrin.

Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that is treatable with antibacterials and hydration but can kill within hours if left untreated.

Outbreaks occur periodically in Cameroon, which has a population of more than 25 million. The last epidemic occurred between January and August 2020, when 66 people died.

According to the World Health Organization, researchers estimate that each year there are between 1.3 million and 4.0 million cases of cholera worldwide, leading to between 21 000 and 143 000 deaths.

In South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), officials announced an increase in cholera cases in the health zone of Kalehe.

Administrator of the territory of Kalehe, Pascal Cimana, said recently, "We are already at epidemiological week 22 with 107 cases including 5 deaths. It is a water shortage problem that is causing this resurgence of this epidemic. We are trying with the partners how to lower this curve," he explained. The administrator of the Kalehe territory indicated that 9 health areas are already affected by this epidemic in the Kalehe health zone.

Medical sources on site informed that the epicenter of this epidemic is located on the islet of Ishovu, in the same territory as overlooks located along Lake Kivu.

It should be noted that several health zones in South Kivu have faced several epidemics since the beginning of last May [2022], including cholera, measles, and poliomyelitis.

Today, Wednesday [15 Jun 2022], the Kirkuk Health Department announced the registration of the 1st case of cholera, while the Sulaymaniyah Health Department warned of the presence of suspected cases in the province.

Kirkuk Health Director, Nabil Hamdi Bushnak, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA) that "the governorate recorded the 1st case of cholera" noting that "the patient's condition is stable."

While the Director of Sulaymaniyah Health, Sabah Hawrami, confirmed, during a press conference attended by the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that "the governorate has not recorded any case of cholera so far, but there are doubts about the cases in hospitals that the symptoms appear on it."

He explained that "Shar Hospital was filled with cases of people with diarrheal disease, and the Martyr Hemin Hospital was designated to receive suspected cholera cases, which are very many," noting that "there are suspicions that cholera is spreading in the city, despite the lack of confirmed results so far." He stressed that "the department has prepared all preparations to receive cases of diarrhea."

[As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus D E, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as 'potentially the most important medical advance' of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally, glucose or rice powder based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
