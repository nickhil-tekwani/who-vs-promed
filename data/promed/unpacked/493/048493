Leishmaniasis here but not an epidemic
-----------------------------------------
Georgian news sources have recently reported that approximately 40 cases of
leishmaniasis occurred 2004 in the country. While cases have been found,
medical specialists caution that recent coverage of the illness has been
overblown. Since the illness can take up to a year to manifest itself, the
exact number of infected in Georgia is not known. However the Tbilisi City
Department of Health said there have only been a few reported cases in the
city.
Dr. Gogi Lolashvili, a physician at Medi Club Georgia, also emphasizes that
the disease is very rare, and there is no cause for alarm. He said that
according to the National Center for Disease Control in Georgia, there has
been no increase in cases over the past 8 years. He added that the recent
coverage of the disease in the Georgia media was a case of "irresponsible"
journalism and could lead to unwarranted concern. In a recent advisory, the
U.S. Embassy in Georgia announced that the disease has been found near
Turtle Lake in Tbilisi, specifically. According to the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control (CDC), the most common forms of the disease affect the skin
or the inner organs. Reportedly, only cutaneous leishmaniasis has been
found in Georgia so far.
Infection is spread through a type of sand fly that becomes infected when
it bites either a person or an animal with the disease. Bug repellent is
available in Tbilisi at drug stores. According to the U. S. Embassy, the
following aptiakebi [drug stores] carry bug spray: PSP, GPC, or Aversi.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Georgia, and registration of cases goes back
to 1928. In the records of the National Center for Disease Control
<http://www.ncdc.ge/>, all cases are recorded as visceral leishmaniasis
(VL), in contrast to the present report, which states that only cutaneous
leishmaniasis (CL) is found in Georgia.
It is conceivable that only visceral cases are recorded (notified), and
ProMED would appreciate further information on this point. The latest year
from which data are available is 2003, when approximately 70 cases of VL
were registered, of which 50 percent were from Tbilisi [National Center for
Disease Control, Epidemiologiuri Biuleteni 2003,8(5)
<http://www.ncdc.ge/publikaciebi/Bul2003_5.html>].
This is a sharp increase since 1995 and before, when only one to 5 cases
were recorded annually. It is no surprise that VL is found in Georgia, as
VL is also found in areas along the southeastern coast of the Black Sea and
the southeastern and southwestern coasts of the Caspian Sea. The
authorities attribute the increase in cases to the unrest and civil wars on
the northern frontiers, making control of sand flies difficult. - Mod.EP]
