_E. coli_ outbreak at retirement home
--------------------------------------------
An outbreak of _E. coli_ O157 bacteria at a Portola Valley retirement
community has stricken as many as 24 residents and employees, sending
7 seniors to the hospital, one in critical condition.
Public health officials spent Thu, 16 Oct 2003, reassuring residents and
trying to track down the source of the intestinal infection at The
Sequoias, a 315-resident complex that includes apartments, an
assisted-living wing, and a skilled nursing facility. A possible clue is
that 4 of the sick people were food service employees, said San Mateo
County Deputy Public Health Officer Sam Stebbins. The bacterium is often
found in undercooked meat, contaminated vegetables, or unpasteurized milk
or juice.
Food contamination "is the most likely possibility at the moment," Stebbins
said. "But we don't have any suggestions as to which type of food." Food
service workers provide meals throughout the facility, and the illness has
struck residents at all 3 of the complex's living settings.
Stebbins conducted a meeting with residents of the facility, broadcast via
closed-circuit television. Meanwhile, 4 epidemiologists and 15 public
health nurses were dispatched to interview 60 residents who had become ill
or had contact with ailing residents. The outbreak is confined to The
Sequoias and is not a threat to the general population, Stebbins stressed.
Of the 7 hospitalized, 3 have already been released, Stebbins said. A total
of 17 residents and 7 employees at the facility have been stricken, but
none of the workers appeared to have required hospitalization. The first
resident was hospitalized Fri, 10 Oct 2003.
Stebbins did not have details about the senior in critical condition at
Stanford University Medical Center or the conditions of the other 3
patients who are being treated at local hospitals. 2 of the hospitalized
seniors had confirmed cases of the _E. coli_ O157 strain.
State officials will also eventually be able to provide a genetic
"snapshot" of bacteria samples from the Portola Valley cases that will
allow them to tell whether it's related to a larger Southern California _E.
coli_ outbreak in which contaminated lettuce served at restaurants sickened
at least 36 people, Stebbins said.
"We don't think it's related,'' Stebbins added. "The state has done a lot
of tracking on that Southern California outbreak, and none of the products
appear to reach Northern California."

[As occurs in young children, the morbidity and mortality of infection with
VTEC (verotoxin-producing _E. coli_) is substantial in the elderly. This
investigation ought to provide important information regarding the specific
source of the outbreak. Having 4 food service workers infected suggests
that they acquired the organism from the same source as the residents. -
