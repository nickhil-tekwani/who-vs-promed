Cambodia reported on Monday [3 Oct 2011] that some 54 Cambodian
children had been killed by dengue fever in the 1st 9 months of this
year [2011], compared to 37 kids dying of the disease in the whole
year of 2010.

>From January to September this year [2011], some 12 392 cases of
dengue fever had been reported with 54 children killed by the disease.
The whole year 2010 reported only 5497 cases, Ngan Chantha, director
of dengue control at the Ministry of Health, said on Monday [3 Oct
2011].

"This year's [2011] rainy season has been plagued by floods, leading
to more cases of the disease," he said. "I would like to appeal to
parents to let their children sleep under mosquito nets and if their
kids have any symptom that is suspicious of the disease, they should
urgently send them for medical attention."

Dengue is caused by mosquitoes. The disease causes an acute illness of
sudden onset that usually follows symptoms such as headache, fever,
exhaustion, severe muscle and joint pain, swollen glands, and rash.

In Cambodia, the outbreak of dengue fever usually begins at the onset
of the rainy season from May to October.
