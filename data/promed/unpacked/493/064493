From: Donald Burke, MD <dburke@jhsph.edu>

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Transmissible Spongiform
Encephalopathy (TSE) advisory panel decision to defer United Kingdom (UK)
blood donors was made so as to maximally reduce the hypothetical risk of
transfusion-associated nvCJD(new variant Creutzfeldt Jacob Disease) but at
the same time minimally reduce the impact on the donor pool. The decision
to recommend no limitations on donors from other European countries was
made at a preceding meeting. This meeting the committee recommended to
defer UK donors (all of Ireland, including the Republic of Ireland, was
recommended to be deferred to minimize confusion in the USA). The vote was
12 for, 9 against (I voted against). Before making their recommendations,
the committee reviewed survey data from the Red Cross on percent of blood
donors from the USA who had visited the UK, and their length of stay.
Percentages of donors who had visited the UK varied by US city, from 10% to
30%. The majority of stays in the UK were quite short. Although no formal
vote was taken, the committee suggested that only donors who had resided in
the UK for longer than 6 months since 1980 should be deferred. This could
reduce the hypothetical nvCJD donation risk (donor person-days in the UK)
by 85% but reduce the donor pool by only 2%.
Ingestion of beef while in the UK was not a criterion for deferral because
over 96% percent of USA donors report eating beef, and because the
mechanism of linkage between nvCJD and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy
(BSE) in the UK is still not known. Deferral of donors from additional
countries was not discussed at this meeting, because the strategy to
maximally reduce the hypothetical risk but minimally impact the blood donor
pool would logically not include other countries where nvCJD in humans is
markedly less common than in the UK (France, 1 case; rest of Europe, no
cases). Even the recommended modest 2% reduction in the USA donor pool may
have untoward consequences.
