[According to information published by ICA on 18 Jul 2017, the Pan-American Center for Foot-and-Mouth Disease (PANAFTOSA), provided the results of their phylogenetic analysis of the virus that came Tame Arauca [see posting 20170626.5131526], showing that this virus is similar to the Venezuelan origin virus. http://www.ica.gov.co/Noticias/Pecuaria/Virus-de-fiebre-aftosa-presentado-en-Colombia-es-d.aspx

For this current outbreak, reported along the border area in the county of Cucuta with Venezuela, the animals showing clinical signs were detected at the border control point of ICA (point of entry). [The finding of suspect animals at this point of entry shows the efforts being done by the Colombian Veterinary Authorities to detect the disease early and contain its spread. - Mod CRD]

The animals originated from a farm located in the county of San Faustino, which is about 300 meters from the border with Venezuela.

Customs Police noted that San Faustino serves as a smuggling corridor for many types of goods including animals. Furthermore, they noted that many farms straddle both Colombian and Venezuelan territory, making it easy for animals to move between the countries.

A determination was made that the case in Tibacuy was epidemiologically linked with the case in Yacopi, and that fomites were the most likely source of transmission. In both cases, ICA triggered their emergency response activities and quarantined both premises upon suspicion of the disease. http://www.ica.gov.co/Noticias/Pecuaria/El-ICA-reporta-foco-de-fiebre-aftosa-a-300-metros.aspx

At the following link http://www.ica.gov.co/aftosa.aspx (link is in Spanish), you can find information on the activities being done by ICA to eradicate FMD.

Colombia, through its animal health Authority (ICA), has been very transparent in immediately reporting these cases of FMD to the OIE as well as to all stakeholders, and has taken immediate actions to contain the outbreak.
