The increased rate of illegal felling of trees and deforestation is one of the reasons for the outbreak of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) or monkey fever, according to health officials. Last week [week of 13 May 2013], a case of KFD had been reported in Noolpuzha Panchayat in Wayanad [district], for the 1st time in the state.

Dr T Jayakrishnan, Associate Professor, Department of Community Medicine, Medical College, Kozhikode, told Express that deforestation is one among the main reasons for the outbreak of KFD. This viral disease is transmitted to human beings through a species of ticks usually found on monkeys. Owing to the shrinking of forest areas, monkeys are entering human habitats and this increases the risk of the disease in future, he added.

The 18-year-old victim, who was admitted to the Kozhikode Medical College, has overcome the critical stage and his condition is now stable.

The infection, which starts with high fever and body ache, has similar symptoms to dengue fever, and has a mortality rate of 4-15 per cent. KFD virus is spread through air or directly through the ticks and is highly contagious [but see comment below]. There is a wide range of natural hosts such as monkeys, rats, shrews, reptiles, and cattle, besides ticks. Man acquires the infection from bites of infected ticks, which suck blood. There is no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

The Health Department officials have stepped up surveillance activities in the forest areas of Wayanad, especially on the Karnataka border, as monkey fever is suspected to have hit parts of Bandipur Tiger Reserve.

The risk is very high as many people choose forest areas for trekking and picnics. Those who are going into the forest should wear long-sleeved dresses and footwear which covers the feet, and should spray insect repellents such as dimethyl phthalate on their clothing, Dr Jayakrishnan added.

[This reported case was posted by ProMED-mail on 14 May 2013 (archive no 20130514.1712790). However, the association of deforestation with the KFD case is new. Sporadic cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) have occurred in the areas described above, with cases of infection in humans and monkeys. Laboratory diagnosis is important, since KFD can be misdiagnosed as dengue hemorrhagic fever. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Contrary to the statement in the report above, KFD virus is not considered highly contagious nor is aerosol transmission important.
