The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) is urging parents and schools to exercise heightened vigilance against scarlet fever, saying its incidence has sharply increased and may remain at a high level in the coming few months.

CHP data shows 77 cases of scarlet fever in the week to 9 Dec 2017 compared with 48 two weeks ago, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reports. A total of 1947 cases were reported in the first 11 months of the year [2017], a significant increase from the same period in the previous 2 years.

Parents have to take extra care of their children in maintaining strict personal and environmental hygiene, a spokesman for the CHP said on [4 Dec 2017]. Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection, which is caused by Group A _Streptococcus_ [also called _Streptococcus pyogenes_], and it mostly afflicts children. It is transmitted through respiratory droplets or direct contact with infected respiratory secretions, according to CHP. The disease, against which there are currently no vaccines available, usually starts with a fever and sore throat, possibly followed by headache, vomiting and abdominal pain. One of its features is the patient's tongue may have a distinctive strawberry-like (red and bumpy) appearance.

The Hong Kong Medical Association (HKMA) said the surge in the number of cases might have something to do with genetic mutation of the related bacteria, which has become a global trend. However, the CHP said there has been no evidence that Group A _Streptococcus_ has had genetic mutation. HKMA vice president Dr. Alvin Chan Yee-shing, said the fatality rate has not increased but added the number of the weekly cases may rise above 100 by the end of the month [December 2017].

Calling the actual situation more serious than CHP data shows, Chan said many parents might fail to detect that their children have caught the disease and don't get them examined by a doctor. This could lead to infected patients passing the disease to others. HKMA council member Dr. Tong Kai-sing called on parents to have their children examined by doctors immediately if they show any symptoms, adding that delayed treatment may have serious consequences. The bacteria may end up causing heart or kidney-related problems.

Patients can see their condition worsen if they also contract chickenpox or influenza at the same time. The HKMA encouraged parents to get chickenpox vaccination for their children as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Professor Yuen Kwok-yung, chair of infectious diseases of the department of microbiology at the University of Hong Kong, said he is studying if Group A _Streptococcus_ has mutated. He said penicillin, the most popular medication for scarlet fever, is effective, as no drug resistance has been found.

[Scarlet fever, caused by erythrogenic toxin-producing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (_Streptococcus pyogenes_), usually follows streptococcal pharyngitis, but may also follow streptococcal infection of the skin or soft tissue, such as wounds, burns, the uterus (that is, puerperal scarlet fever), or the skin lesions of chickenpox. Scarlet fever typically affects children ages 5 to 15. By the age of 10 years, most people will have developed immunity to erythrogenic toxin.

Scarlet fever is highly contagious. Transmission occurs via airborne respiratory particles dispersed from infected patients by coughing or sneezing, usually in the colder winter months, or through contact with infected wounds or sores on the skin. It can rarely spread through contaminated food
(http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJM196904242801702).
Those who carry the bacteria in the nasopharynx or on the skin but have no symptoms are less contagious (https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=10190).

Complications of scarlet fever include local spread of the streptococcal throat infection to involve regional lymph nodes, retropharyngeal tissues, middle ear, and sinuses and immune-mediated diseases such as acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Septic complications due to spread of GAS (Group A Streptococcus) in blood, such as meningitis, pyogenic arthritis, and endocarditis, occur rarely.

Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever has been less than 1 percent.

Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as has been happening in the UK since 2014 (1,2). Starting in 2014, scarlet fever notifications increased 3.4-fold, from 4643 in 2013 to 15 637 in 2014 in England and Wales. The subsequent seasons saw a return of increased scarlet fever activity, with 17 696 notifications in 2015 and 19 206 in 2016, the highest number of cases and incidence rate of scarlet fever since 1967. All regions of England saw an increase in incidence. The median age of cases in 2014 was 4 years and outbreaks were common in nurseries and schools. The U.K. outbreak is multiclonal, which rules out the introduction of a new group A streptococcal strain with enhanced capacity to cause scarlet fever: Genotyping identified a diversity of emm types with emm 3 (43 percent), emm 12 (15 percent), emm 1 (11 percent), and emm 4 (9 percent) being the most common.

A resurgence of scarlet fever also occurred in Hong Kong in 2011-2012, associated with toxin acquisition and multidrug resistance (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401300). Genetic analysis indicated emm12 was the most common type at that time and the outbreak was multiclonal (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22615319). The above news report may indicate another resurgence of the scarlet fever in Hong Kong.
