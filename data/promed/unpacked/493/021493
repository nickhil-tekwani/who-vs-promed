Tularemia, Denmark
----------------------
Information received on 15 Dec 2015 from Dr Per Starcke Henriksen, Chief Veterinary Officer, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration, Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries, Glostrup, Denmark

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification (Final report)
Date of start of the event: 17 Nov 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 11 Dec 2015
Reason for notification: Reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 23 Nov 2012
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: _Francisella tularensis_
Nature of diagnosis: Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1

Outbreak 1: Almindingen, Bornholm, East
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2015
Outbreak status: Resolved (11 Dec 2015)
Epidemiological unit: Forest
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Brown hare (European hare): Leporidae (_Lepus europaeus_) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Affected population: A wild European hare found dead near Ekkodalen in Almindingen on Bornholm.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: In relation to tularemia, Denmark is assumed to be a low endemic area of _F. tularensis holarctica_ (type B). This assumption is based on the human cases of tularemia in Denmark.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Statens Serum Institut (national laboratory) / Brown hare (European hare) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 11 Dec 2015 / Positive

Future reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following information was obtained from The Center for Food Security & Public Health, Iowa State University, Fact Sheet on Tularemia, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/tularemia.pdf:

"Tularemia is a zoonotic bacterial disease that can affect many mammals.

Tularemia results from infection by _Francisella tularensis_ (formerly known as _Pasteurella tularensis_), a Gram negative coccobacillus in the family Francisellaceae. Four subspecies are currently recognized. Although all 4 cause tularemia, they tend to be associated with different animal hosts, and their propensity to cause severe disease varies. _F. tularensis_ subsp. tularensis (also known as type A) has been found almost exclusively in North America. It is the most virulent species, particularly in humans. _F. tularensis_ subsp. holarctica (type B) is much more widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but it is less virulent. The 2 remaining species, _F. tularensis_ subsp. mediasiatica and _F. tularensis_ subsp. novicida, have been recognized in limited geographical regions, are rarely found in people, and seem to cause relatively mild disease when they occur. Additional subspecies have also been proposed.

With rare exceptions, tularemia occurs only in the Northern Hemisphere. This disease has been reported from North America, Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East, and northern Africa. A single human case, caused by _F. tularensis novicida_, was acquired in Australia.

_F. tularensis tularensis_ is seen almost exclusively in North America and has very rarely been isolated in Europe. _F. tularensis holarctica_ is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. This species is responsible for nearly all cases of tularemia outside North America. It co-exists with _F. tularensis tularensis_ in North America. _F. tularensis mediasiatica_ occurs in a limited area of Central Asia, and _F. tularensis novicida_ has been reported from North America, Australia and Spain.

Humans acquire _F. tularensis_ from various sources including lakes and streams, food contaminated by the carcasses of infected animals or their excretions, laboratory cultures or clinical samples, and tissues from infected animals. Hunting or skinning animals, or contact with meat when preparing food, are important routes of exposure. Respiratory infections sometimes occur in farmers who are exposed through activities such as piling hay. Cases have been reported after mowing lawns, possibly from running over an animal carcass. Human infections have also been linked to handling infected animals or being bitten by them. Person-to-person transmission has not been reported." - Mod.CRD
