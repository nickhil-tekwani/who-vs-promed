[1] Indonesia: more than 2 million cases
Date: Sat 26 Jun 2021

COVID infections have surged in Indonesia, a nation of 270 million people, in the past week, with more than 2 million cases reported as of Sat 26 Jun 2021, and hospital occupancy rates soared to more than 75 percent in the capital Jakarta and other hard-hit areas.

The country is also grappling with new virus strains, including the highly infectious Delta variant 1st identified in India.

In Jakarta, the surge in cases have forced hospitals to set up emergency tents, according to Detik news website, which quoted provincial government officials.

In Medan, the capital city of North Sumatra province, Dr Inke Nadia D Lubis, member of the COVID task force in the area, reported that in the last 6 months, as many as 1800 children have been infected with the virus, including 14 who have died.

More than 1/3rd of the cases reported were elementary school-age students, while a quarter were high school-age students, Inke was quoted by Detik as saying.

On Fri 25 Jun 2021, President Joko Widodo said that the country is facing an "extraordinary situation," vowing to respond with "quick and appropriate policies."

Nearly 1000 Indonesian health workers have also died from the virus since the pandemic started, with the country's medical association confirming on Fri 25 Jun 2021 that 401 doctors were among the victims, including 14 who were fully vaccinated.

This month [June 2021], more than 300 vaccinated doctors and healthcare workers in Central Java were found to have been infected with COVID-19, with about a dozen hospitalised.

The rise of severe cases in inoculated medical workers has raised questions about the China-produced Sinovac jab, which Indonesia is heavily relying on to vaccinate more than 180 million people by early next year [2022].

Clinical symptoms suggest that the Delta variant is responsible for a surge in cases in West Java, the medical association's spokesperson for the province, Eka Mulyana, said.

"In West Java, bed occupancy rates have exceeded 90 percent. Some hospitals' rates are even more than 100 percent," he told reporters. "At this rate, our health system is close to collapse."

Dozens of communities in Central Java's Kudus regency were put under lockdown after the Delta variant was detected in local testing samples, causing a sudden spike in virus cases.

The surge has been partly blamed on millions travelling from that region across the Muslim-majority nation at the end of Ramadan last month [May 2021], despite an official ban on the annual migration. The Indonesian medical association's Kudus representative, Ahmad Ipul Syaifuddin, has said the mass movement of people had made it next to impossible to determine where the surge began.

"We have no clue on how to trace and find the 1st spreader of the Delta cases because the sampling test results came out around 3 weeks after the mass exodus," he said. "My sample was among the tested sampling for the Delta variant. I have already recovered and (have) tested negative now, but I still have a cough."

Meanwhile, the Jakarta Post reported that among those who were recently infected with the coronavirus is an unnamed Indonesian official, who was travelling to Italy for an international conference.

The official is under quarantine for 10 days after testing positive upon arrival at the Sicilian port city of Catania, where officials from around the world were convening for a series of G20 ministerial meetings.

Nearly 1000 Indonesian health workers have died from the virus since the pandemic started, with the country's medical association confirming on Fri 25 Jun 2021 that 401 doctors were among the victims.

[2] WHO: face masks
Date: Fri 25 Jun 2021

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/06/25/delta-who-urges-fully-vaccinated-people-to-continue-to-wear-masks-as-variant-spreads.html?__twitter_impression=true


The World Health Organization on Fri 25 Jun 2021 urged fully vaccinated people to continue to wear masks, social distance, and practice other Covid-19 pandemic safety measures as the highly contagious delta variant spreads rapidly across the globe.

"People cannot feel safe just because they had the 2 doses. They still need to protect themselves," Dr. Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general for access to medicines and health products, said during a news briefing from the agency's Geneva headquarters.

"Vaccine alone won't stop community transmission," Simao added. "People need to continue to use masks consistently, be in ventilated spaces, practice hand hygiene and physical distancing, and avoid crowding. This still continues to be extremely important, even if you're vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing."

The health organization's comments come as some countries, including the United States, have largely done away with masks and pandemic-related restrictions as the Covid vaccines have helped drive down the number of new infections and deaths.

The number of new infections in the U.S. has held steady over the last week at an average of 11 659 new cases per day, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Still, new infections have been plummeting over the last several months.

WHO officials said they are asking fully vaccinated people to continue to "play it safe" because a large portion of the world remains unvaccinated and highly contagious variants, like delta, are spreading in many countries, spurring outbreaks.

The Wall Street Journal reported Fri 25 Jun 2021 that about half of adults infected in an outbreak of the delta variant in Israel were fully vaccinated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, prompting the government there to reimpose an indoor mask requirement and other measures.

"Yes, you can reduce some measures, and different countries have different recommendations in that regard. But there's still the need for caution," Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor to the WHO's director-general, said at the briefing. "As we are seeing, there are new variants emerging."

The WHO said last week that delta is becoming the dominant variant of the disease worldwide.

WHO officials have said the variant, 1st found in India but now in at least 92 countries, is the fastest and fittest coronavirus strain yet, and it will "pick off" the most vulnerable people, especially in places with low Covid vaccination rates.

They said there were reports that the delta variant also causes more severe symptoms but that more research is needed to confirm those conclusions. Still, there are signs the delta strain could provoke different symptoms than other variants.

It has the potential "to be more lethal because it's more efficient in the way it transmits between humans, and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals who will become severely ill, have to be hospitalized, and potentially die," Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said.

In the U.S., President Joe Biden said Covid deaths nationwide will continue to rise due to the spread of the "dangerous" delta variant, calling it a "serious concern." He warned that Americans who are still unvaccinated are especially at risk.

"600 000-plus Americans have died, and with this delta variant, you know there's going to be others as well. You know it's going to happen. We've got to get young people vaccinated," Biden said on Thu 24 Jun 2021 at a community center in Raleigh, North Carolina.

[In the US, almost all of the people who are dying from COVID-19 now are unvaccinated.

The Associated Press reports that the number of deaths per day has declined to fewer than 300 a day. Data analyzed from May 2021 reveals that "breakthrough" infections -- people who are fully vaccinated and have the virus -- make up less than 1200 of the current 853 000 COVID hospitalizations, or 0.1 percent of hospitalizations.

CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said this week that the vaccines are "nearly 100% effective against severe disease and death," adding that "nearly every death, especially among adults, due to COVID-19, is, at this point, entirely preventable." (from https://www.complex.com/life/almost-all-americans-now-dying-from-covid-unvaccinated).

It is these unvaccinated individuals who are particularly at high risk for the delta variant. How to convince the vaccine holdouts of the value of the vaccine is a dilemma. - Mod.LK]

All of Greater Sydney will be placed into lockdown from 6pm on Sat 26 Jul 2021, as health authorities work to contain a "concerning" surge in coronavirus cases.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the extension of current lockdown measures after a crisis Cabinet meeting on Sat 26 Jul 2021 and as the state recorded 12 new locally acquired infections.

Currently, stay-at-home orders are in place for 4 Sydney local government areas: Woollahra, Waverley, Randwick, and the City of Sydney

Following the crisis meeting, Ms Berejiklian said all of Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Central Coast and Wollongong will be under stay-at-home orders from 6pm on Sat 26 Jul 2021 until midnight, 9 Jul 2021.

"Even though we don't want to impose burdens unless we absolutely have to, unfortunately, this is a situation where we have to," Ms Berejiklian said. "I said that this is the scariest time since the pandemic started, and that's proven to be the case."

At an earlier press conference on Sat 26 Jul 2021, Ms Berejiklian said the situation is "worsening beyond what we would have liked to have seen," and foreshadowed that the current restrictions may be extended.

"I am putting everybody on notice that we may need to extend that during the course of the day or tomorrow," she told reporters on Sat 26 Jul 2021 morning. "But that will be based on health advice and decisions taken by the Cabinet crisis meeting."

The official case tally for Sat 26 Jul 2021 was 29 infections, including 17 that were previously announced, out of over 55 220 tests. All but one of the new cases are linked to an existing cluster. But the state's chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said only 12 of the 29 new cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period.

"The situation overnight has highlighted that an increasing number of people have been undetected and infectious in the community, and those exposure sites have spread," Dr Chant said.

"Largely, they were contained in the 4 LGAs, but now we are seeing the spread to exposure venues outside of those 4 LGAs, and that is the basis for my growing concern."

["Bangladesh to Australia: List of countries imposing fresh curbs due to Delta variant:

"Britain has already extended the date of full reopening by 4 weeks after the country started reporting a surge in Covid-19 cases, with the Delta variant becoming the dominant strain.

"The rapid spread of a more virulent version of coronavirus, B.1.617.2, also known as the Delta variant, has forced several countries to rethink their roadmap out of lockdown, and many of them have started imposing fresh restrictions, fearing another wave of coronavirus disease."
