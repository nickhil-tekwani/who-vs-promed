Update: Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox --- Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, 2003
------------------------------------------------
CDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate cases of
monkeypox among persons in the United States who had contact with wild or
exotic mammalian pets or with persons with monkeypox (1, 2, 3, 4). This
report updates results of the epidemiologic investigation, provides
information on the use of smallpox vaccine during the outbreak, and
summarizes the animal tracing activities to identify the origin and
subsequent distribution of infected animals.
Epidemiologic Investigation
---------------------------
As of Tue 8 Jul 2003, a total of 71 cases of monkeypox have been reported
to CDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (16), Illinois (12), Missouri (2),
Kansas (one), and Ohio (one); these include 35 (49 percent) cases
laboratory-confirmed at CDC and 36 (51 percent) suspect and probable cases
under investigation by state and local health departments. 11 cases were
excluded from those reported previously because they met the exclusion
criteria outlined in the updated national case definition, and one new case
was added (1). The number of cases increased from 15 May 2003 through the
week ending 8 Jun 2003 and declined subsequently; the date of onset for the
last case was 20 Jun 2003.
Of the 71 cases, 39 (55 percent) occurred among females; the median age was
28 years (range: 1 to 51 years). Age data were unavailable for one patient.
Among 69 patients for whom data were available, 18 (26 percent) were
hospitalized; some patients were hospitalized for isolation precautions
only. 2 patients, both children, had serious clinical illness (1, 2, 3, 4);
both of these patients have recovered. The majority of patients were
exposed to prairie dogs. Some patients were exposed in premises where
prairie dogs were kept, and others were exposed to persons with monkeypox.
No patients have been confirmed to have had exposure to persons with
monkeypox as their only possible exposure.
Of the 35 laboratory-confirmed cases, 32 (91 percent) tested positive for
monkeypox by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), culture, immunohistochemical
testing (IHC), and/or electron microscopy in skin rash lesions; two tested
positive by PCR and/or culture of an oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swab;
and one tested positive by PCR and culture of a lymph node aspirate. For
laboratory-confirmed cases, onset of illness ranged from 16 May to 20 Jun
2003. The majority of patients reported a clinical illness that included
rash (one patient had a single, atypical plaque-like skin lesion) and
fever. The median incubation period* was 12 days (range: 1 to 31 days).
Use of Smallpox Vaccine
-----------------------
To prevent transmission of monkeypox, 30 persons (28 adults and 2 children)
in 6 states have received smallpox vaccine since 13 Jun 2003. Vaccine was
administered pre-exposure to 7 persons (3 veterinarians, 2 laboratory
workers, and 2 health-care workers) and post-exposure to 23 persons (10
health-care workers, 7 household contacts, 3 laboratory workers, one public
health veterinarian, one public health epidemiologist, and one work
contact). No serious adverse events were reported following smallpox
vaccination, and no requests for vaccinia immune globulin have been
received. Among the 30 persons who received smallpox vaccine, 3 (10
percent) reported rash within 2 weeks of vaccination. One of the 3 was
confirmed as having monkeypox; another person had 2 skin lesion specimens
that tested negative for orthopoxvirus and varicella zoster virus at the
state health laboratory; no specimens were obtained for the third person
who reported a single, dime-sized, pruritic and erythematous skin lesion
(not pustular) remote from the vaccination site that appeared 4 days after
vaccination and faded within a week.
Animal Traceback and Trace-Forward Investigations
------------------------------------------------
Traceback investigations have determined that all 35 confirmed human cases
of monkeypox were associated with prairie dogs obtained from an Illinois
animal distributor (IL-1), or from animal distributors who purchased
prairie dogs from IL-1 [The text is accompanied by an excellent diagram
which cannot be reproduced here, but should be consulted for better
appreciation of the situation. - Mod.CP]. Traceback of animal exposures are
ongoing for other cases. Prairie dogs at IL-1 appear to have been infected
through contact with Gambian giant rats and dormice that originated in
Ghana and were purchased on 21 Apr 2003 by IL-1. Approximately 200 prairie
dogs had been at the IL-1 facility during the period April to May; an
unspecified number overlapped with the arrival of the imported African
rodents on 21 Apr 2003 and probably were exposed to monkeypox. A total of
93 infected or potentially infected prairie dogs were traced from IL-1 to 6
states; in addition, an unknown number of prairie dogs died or were
reportedly sold (as pets for sale or exchange) at animal swap meets for
which no records were available for tracing. At CDC, laboratory testing of
4 prairie dogs originating from IL-1 confirmed the presence of monkeypox
virus by PCR and IHC.
Traceback investigations to identify the source of introduction of
monkeypox into the United States identified a Texas animal distributor
(TX-1) that had imported a shipment of approximately 800 small mammals from
Ghana on 9 Apr 2003 that contained 762 African rodents, including rope
squirrels (_Funiscuirus_ sp.), tree squirrels (_Heliosciurus_ sp.), Gambian
giant rats (_Cricetomys_ sp.), brushtail porcupines (_Atherurus_ sp.),
dormice (_Graphiurus_ sp.), and striped mice (_Hybomys_ sp.). CDC
laboratory testing of some animals from this shipment confirmed the
presence of monkeypox by PCR and virus isolation in several rodent species,
including one Gambian rat, 3 dormice, and 2 rope squirrels (1).
Trace-forward investigations of the rodents on the shipment were initiated
before the availability of laboratory results because of concerns that
animals were a potential source of continued spread of monkeypox. Of the
762 rodents from the original shipment, 584 (77 percent) have been traced
to distributors in 6 states. A total of 178 (23 percent) African rodents
could not be traced beyond the point of entry in Texas because records were
not available. No suspect, probable, or confirmed cases of human monkeypox
have been associated with direct contact with the African rodents from the
9 Apr 2003 shipment. In addition, other than the prairie dogs traced from
IL-1 to subsequent sites, no cases of monkeypox in other animals that had
contact with the African rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment have been
reported.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
The outbreak described in this report highlights the public health threat
posed by importation, for commercial purposes, of exotic pets into the
United States. Epidemiologic and animal traceback investigations confirm
that the first community-acquired human cases of monkeypox in the United
States resulted from contact with infected prairie dogs that had been
housed or transported with African rodents imported from Ghana.
Imported, exotic wild animals can carry non-indigenous, zoonotic pathogens,
which can spread rapidly among indigenous susceptible animal populations in
the United States, particularly when mixed together in close proximity. In
addition, inter-species exchange of pathogens is possible because of close
relations between humans and their pets. In this outbreak, the rapid and
widespread distribution of monkeypox-infected and potentially infected
imported wild animals to distributors and potential buyers in several
settings (e.g., pet stores, swap meets, and wild animal trade centers) in
the United States and to other countries enabled epizootic spread through
multiple states before effective interventions could be implemented.
Public health strategies to control this outbreak, including the Food and
Drug Administration-CDC joint order banning importation and prohibiting
movement of the implicated animal species, state-enacted measures to
further restrict intrastate animal shipment and trade (4), premise
quarantine, and animal euthanasia, appear to have been effective in
reducing exposure of humans to infected animals, with few cases reported
since its implementation on 11 Jun 2003. Additional control measures have
included pre- and post-exposure vaccination of potentially exposed persons
with smallpox vaccine (5).
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/pdf/embargo.pdf>)
Laboratory tests have demonstrated the presence of monkeypox virus in
several rodents from the original shipment from Ghana that died
unexpectedly and did not exhibit characteristic signs of monkeypox in
animals (e.g., conjunctivitis, lymphadenopathy, and skin lesions). For this
reason, CDC guidance for premise quarantine and animal euthanasia is based
on the possibility that infected rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment could
be asymptomatic, shed virus, and potentially cause infection in other
susceptible animals or humans.
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/quarantineremoval.htm>)
Although no human monkeypox cases have been associated with contact with
rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment, these animals are considered to pose
a continued risk for infection for other animals and humans. Euthanasia,
following American Veterinary Medical Association guidelines, is
recommended for all rodents from the 9 Apr 2003 shipment and for any
prairie dogs that were on the premises at the same time as any of the
African rodents.
(<http://www.avma.org/noah/members/policy/default.asp>)
In addition, mammals in facilities that housed a rodent from the 9 Apr 2003
shipment should be placed under quarantine for 6 weeks following the last
date a rodent of concern was present. Efforts are underway to collect
additional epidemiologic and laboratory data on both human and animal cases
and their contacts, including animal handlers who might have been exposed
to infected rodents.
Importation of exotic animals and indigenous, wild animals harvested for
the commercial pet trade have been associated with previous outbreaks of
infectious diseases in humans, including salmonella associated with
reptiles (e.g., lizards, snakes, and turtles) and tularemia associated with
prairie dogs (6, 7); prairie dogs also have been documented to be infected
with other human pathogens (e.g., plague) (8). The Institute of Medicine
recently highlighted the role of international travel and commerce in the
emergence of infectious diseases through the dissemination of pathogens and
their vectors throughout the world (9). CDC and other federal agencies, in
collaboration with state and local health departments and professional
organizations, are developing long-term strategies to coordinate the
control of importation, exportation, interstate trade, and intrastate sale
of exotic and native wild animals (10).
Health-care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who
suspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their
state and local health departments. State health departments should report
suspect cases to CDC, telephone 770-488-7100. An updated case definition
with revised case exclusion criteria is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/index.htm>. Rash illnesses suspected
to be monkeypox should be confirmed by laboratory evaluation. Clinical
specimens should be submitted for testing after consultation with the state
and local health departments. Protocols for specimen collection, including
completion of specimen submission forms, should follow CDC guidance
available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/diagspecimens.htm>.
Because information included in the specimen-submission and case-reporting
forms is essential for accurate interpretation of laboratory results, these
forms should be completed by state health departments. Preferred specimens
for testing are those from skin lesions. Because smallpox vaccine might
modify monkeypox disease, evaluation of any rash post-vaccination in a
person exposed to monkeypox should include laboratory testing for monkeypox
virus.
