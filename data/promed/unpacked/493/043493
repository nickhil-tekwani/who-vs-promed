Cyanide poisoning has killed 22 elephants in Hwange National Park, the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority said [Mon 26 Oct 2015], bringing the poisoning toll across the country to 62 elephants for the month.

Rangers found the animals' carcasses on Monday morning [26 Oct 2015], the parks agency spokeswoman, Caroline Washaya-Moyo, said. She said poachers had gotten away with 3 ivory tusks, adding, "We are now trying to check how many elephants had fully developed tusks, because babies are among those killed."

She called the continuing losses to cyanide "alarming" and noted that many other species were also dying from the poison used against elephants.

In 2013, more than 200 elephants died from cyanide poisoning in Hwange.

Ms Washaya-Moyo said the parks agency was hoping that trained dogs and drones would help tighten monitoring of the vast park. On [Mon 26 Oct 2015], national parks officials also announced that over the weekend [24-25 Oct 2015] the authorities at Harare International Airport seized 380 pounds of ivory, worth USD 43 250, that ere about to be smuggled to Singapore. 3 Zimbabweans and a Malian citizen were arrested, they said.

Cyanide can come in either a gas, as in hydrogen cyanide, or as a solid, in the form of potassium cyanide and/or sodium cyanide. As a solid crystalline form, it may well have been put out as some kind of bait for the elephants.

Once cyanide is in the system, the cells are unable to use oxygen, because cellular respiration is blocked through the inhibition of the cytochrome oxidase system and inhibition of the enzyme

If this was put out as a crystalline bait, then the operating theory of the perpetrators was that crystalline cyanide salts will work faster because of the acid in the stomach. These animals would likely have had difficulty breathing, perhaps causing panic, and then cardiac arrest. This was a painful death for these elephants.

Elephants are exceptionally intelligent, and family oriented animals. They are very human-like in their emotions and thought processes. This is truly a heinous crime.

These poachers have been very shrewd observers of animal behavior. Elephants need a relatively large amount of sodium in their diet. The Journal of Mammalogy indicates that they tend to be somewhat deficient in sodium. As a consequence, they tend to seek out the salty soil and consume it.

Many elephant and mammal salt licks are areas within the ground that are high in sodium. An early salt lick may be seen at http://www.lastrefuge.co.uk/php/show-images-all-big.php?id=AW03538. However, these salt licks do not remain flat. After a time, they resemble a hole which can hold water, as seen at http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169555X1100314X-gr2.jpg.

According to Holdo RM, Dudley JP and McDowell LR: Geophagy in the African elephant in relation to availability of dietary sodium
Journal of Mammalogy 2002; 83(3): 652-64 (http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1644/1545-1542(2002)083%3C0652%3AGITAEI%3E2.0.CO%3B2):

"We studied the use of mineral licks by African elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) during the dry season in a Kalahari-sand habitat in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, to investigate the role of geophagy as a mechanism for supplementing low Na+ [sodium] levels in browse and natural water supplies. Plant, water, and soil macrominerals were measured to evaluate mineral availability for elephants during the dry season. Elephant behavior was monitored at licks to investigate the intensity of geophagy (measured by number of mouthfuls of soil consumed) in relation to fecal-[sodium] loss. Female elephants, which probably had greater requirements than did males because of pregnancy and lactation, consumed more mouthfuls of soil and spent a greater part of their activity budget feeding on soil than did males, suggesting that geophagy may be driven by a nutritional requirement. We found the following consistent with the [sodium]-supplementation hypothesis: 1) unlike other minerals, [sodium] in woody plants and natural water supplies may be inadequate to meet the minimum requirements of elephants during the dry season; 2) soils consumed by elephants differed from other soils primarily in their high [sodium] content; 3) intensity of geophagy was negatively correlated with fecal [sodium]; and 4) elephants in non-Kalahari-sand habitats do not appear to create or use licks, probably because they are able to meet their [sodium] requirements from ubiquitous [sodium]-rich water supplies, which do not occur naturally in Kalahari-sand habitats."

But according to http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/Cyanide/upload/CN_remediation_young.pdf, page 109: "Soils, wastes and ores containing minerals such as ilmenite (FeTiO3), hematite (Fe2O3), bauxite [AlO.OH/Al(OH)3], and pyrite (FeS2), as well as mineral-groups such as feldspars, zeolites, and clays have been shown to effectively adsorb free and metal-complexed cyanides. Depending on the mineral, cyanide adsorption is usually a combination of 2 mechanisms: ion exchange, precipitation or coulomb interaction. Cyanide attenuation by such mineral commodities purifies ground and surface waters but increases cyanide consumption in leaching operations."

With bowl-like areas holding water, a number of things may be in play to neutralize the stable sodium cyanide or even potassium cyanide. It is possible that the cyanide salt may be bound or neutralized by the calcrete clays that are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix around these natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats. However, if that were the case, we should be seeing fewer deaths than have occurred. The rainy season should be upon these areas soon and may help dilute the water holes where these very stable cyanide salts are.

While some substances may bind the cyanide salts, they could be detoxified by acidifying the soil or the water. However, this is a very dangerous situation, as when the acid is applied to the cyanide salts, they release the cyanide as gas, and such gas escaping in a cloud from one of these salt holes or licks may be enough to kill the person unless they have protective gear such as respirators and suits. This would also be a labor intensive and expensive method, but it could be done.

Additional information is available from this document.

Perhaps if lucky, at least some of the cyanide in the salt licks will be bound and neutralized by the calcrete clays, which are the dominant constituent of the soil matrix of the natural salt licks in Hwange's Kalahari Sands habitats.

One article elsewhere stated that these poachers were actually working for the park and were doing this in revenge for low payment. While this is possible, it may be less likely as the tusks were taken and there have been arrests.

The park ranger mentioned dogs and drones. Drones may be the most beneficial at spotting them, identifying them, and providing evidence for prosecution. Dogs may be good at scaring them but sadly, poachers are adept at using poisoning, as witnessed by the situation with the elephants. - Mod.TG]
