At least one Canadian case of _E. coli_ [O157:H7] infection has been
linked to tainted spinach that killed a Wisconsin woman and sickened
about 175 others in the United States.
A woman in Renfrew County in eastern Ontario is recovering at home
after being treated in hospital, Dan Strasbourg, a spokesman for
Ontario's Health Ministry said yesterday, 25 Sep 2006.
Dan Strasbourg said there is no cause for concern. "This is one case
that we've seen," Strasbourg said. "The individual became sick in
early September and it's the only case that we've seen since the
outbreak began in the USA."
The ministry was working with the local health unit to investigate
the illness and is monitoring _E. coli_ through the province.

identified this Canadian isolate as the outbreak strain. Previous
postings have mentioned that some of the suspect spinach was
distributed in Canada. Renfrew county is located in eastern Ontario,
bordering Quebec. Its location can be seen at:
