Bovine tuberculosis has infected 2 convicts at a prison in the latest example of the cattle disease jumping between species. The cases were diagnosed at Erlestoke prison, near Devizes in Wiltshire, in 2017 and 2018, said Public Health England (PHE).

"PHE supported the investigation and advised on the screening of contacts in the community and in the prison," it added.

The investigation could not find the source of the disease, which may be transmitted from cattle by eating infected meat, drinking unpasteurised milk, or by direct contact with sick animals. Cattle also infect other mammals such as cats, deer, badgers, and humans, which become infectious too.

Scientists estimate that up to 1% of England's 10 million cats now carry the disease.

[Erlestoke Prison is a men's prison, located to the east of the village of Erlestoke in Wiltshire, England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Erlestoke). The prison is built around a converted country house (Erlestoke House) that was originally built between 1780 and 1810. Erlestoke Prison receives adult male prisoners from England and Wales. Most cells at Erlestoke Prison are single occupancy with integral sanitation. However, there are a small number of double, purpose-built cells on 2 of the accommodation units, and 2, 3-bed cells on one other accommodation unit (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Prison_Erlestoke).

Wiltshire is a landlocked county in South West England, bordered by the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiltshire). A map showing the location of Erlestoke can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/DpjsCNiBaR52.

_Mycobacterium bovis_ causes bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in humans, an infection that is clinically similar to infection caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb)_. Like infection caused by _M. tb_, people who are infected but not ill have what is called latent TB infection (LTBI), which can become clinically apparent (TB disease) later in life.

_M. bovis_ and _M. tb_ are closely related genetically, and the standard nucleic acid amplification assay will only identify _M. bovis_ as a member of the "_M. tuberculosis_ complex," which includes _M. tuberculosis_, _M. bovis_, _M. africanum_, the Bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin strain (BCG), _M. microti_, _M. canetti_, _M. caprae_, and _M. pinnipedii_.

Frequently many clinical laboratories do not speciate further, and the pathogen is presumed mistakenly to be _M. tb_, which can lead to misdiagnosis and widespread underreporting.

Accurate speciation of isolates from clinical specimens is important for both epidemiologic and clinical reasons. _M. bovis_ is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide, a drug that is an essential component of "short course" therapy for infection due to drug-susceptible _M. tb_ (isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampin for 4 months) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab2). If used for _M. bovis_ infection, "short course" therapy is likely to fail. Resistance to pyrazinamide requires a 9-month treatment duration instead of the 6-month, short-course therapy (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5211a1.htm#tab2).

_M. bovis_ can infect a wide range of domesticated mammals and some wildlife, including cattle, deer, pigs, and badgers. It is thought to be transmitted within herds by inhalation of infected aerosols from infected animals. _M. bovis_ is mainly transmitted to people by their consuming unpasteurized milk or dairy products from infected cows (pasteurization kills _M. bovis_). _M. bovis_ can also be transmitted by inhaling aerosols of _M. bovis_ expelled in close proximity by an infected animal or person with _M. bovis_ pulmonary infection, by direct contact with infected tissue, such as what might occur during the dressing and processing of infected animal carcasses, and by ingestion of poorly cooked or raw tissue from an infected animal.

Transmission of tuberculosis within prisons is a recognized problem worldwide (http://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/population-groups/prisons-facts/en/), including the US (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5509a1.htm). Prisoners typically come from segments of the population at higher risk for tuberculosis (such as injection drugs users, persons of low socioeconomic status, and persons with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection. These persons often receive insufficient medical care before incarceration. Also, the physical structure of correctional facilities, such as close living quarters and inadequate ventilation, contributes to tuberculosis transmission.

TB caused by _M. bovis_, diagnosed in fewer than 40 people in the UK each year (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5382737/), is more common in developing than developed countries (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0108_article) and prisons in the UK may house immigrants from these developing countries (https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04334/SN04334.pdf). We are not told in the news report above if the infected prisoners were immigrants from these _M. bovis_- endemic countries. Also we are not told if the infected prisoners had contact with possibly _M. bovis_-infected animals. Cattle and cats with confirmed _M. bovis_ infection are known to exist in the UK (https://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/174/13/322).

We are also not told if prisoners and staff are tuberculin skin tested for latent TB on entry into prison and the frequency of tuberculin skin test conversion in various segments of the prison population and staff.

Presumably the news report above of "cattle disease jumping between species" is referring to TB due to _M. bovis_, but we are not told specifically the species of _Mycobacterium_ causing TB in the 2 prisoners. In addition, we are not told if genotypes of the isolates from the 2 prisoners with active TB matched, which would confirm a common source. More information on the epidemiological investigation of this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
