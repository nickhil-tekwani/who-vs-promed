Wild jackrabbits found dead in Adams County tested positive for a highly contagious disease lethal for rabbits. Seven counties in Colorado have now reported positive cases of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus type 2 (RHDV-2).

RHDV-2 can cause internal bleeding and swelling, according to wildlife officials. Affected animals may have blood staining the nose and mouth. Only rabbits, hares and pikas, the diminutive cousin of rabbits, can spread it among each other; humans can't become infected with it.

The disease recently appeared in pockets of the western U.S., and experts warn that if it continues to spread unchecked, it could harm all of the dozen-plus species of rabbits in the U.S. and the ecosystems they belong to. Wildlife officials say it has already had significant impacts on rabbits and species preying upon them in Europe. RHDV-2 is considered a foreign animal disease and is of high concern at the state and federal levels.

Last week, a landowner in Adams county found 6 dead jackrabbits on her property, east of Barr Lake, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Officers submitted the jackrabbits to CPW's [Colorado's Parks and Wildlife] Wildlife Health Laboratory for necropsy. On Thu 11 Jun 2020, they got test results showing that the animals were positive for RHDV- 2.

"It is very possible there are other cases out there having not been observed or reported," said Matt Martinez, Area Wildlife Manager for 7 counties surrounding Denver.

"We will continue to monitor jackrabbits and cottontails in all the counties of the Denver Metro Area," Martinez stated.

The last RHDV-2 case prior to the one in Adams County was on 6 Jun 2020 of a domestic rabbit from Weld County.

The other 6 counties in Colorado with positive RHDV-2 cases are Alamosa (wild cottontail and jackrabbits), El Paso (feral rabbits, wild jackrabbits and domestic rabbit), Montezuma (domestic rabbit), Prowers (wild cottontails), Pueblo (wild cottontails) and Weld (domestic rabbit).

[This disease continues to be reported in many states within the US and clearly impacts rabbits but also animals who prey upon them as a food source, as the rabbit population is reduced.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and fatal hepatitis of wild and domestic European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). RHD is caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_, family _Caliciviridae_), a nonenveloped small round RNA virus with only one major capsid protein (VP60).

Genetic and antigenic comparison and epidemiological data indicate the existence of 3 main RHDV groups:
- The "classical RHDV," including genogroups G1-G5, 1st reported in China (People's Rep. of) in 1984. To date, this RHDV has been reported in over 40 countries in Asia, Africa, Americas, Europe and Oceania and is endemic in most parts of the world where European rabbits live naturally or are domesticated.
- The subtype RHDVa/G6 identified in Europe on 1996 and currently reported in other continents (Oceania, Asia and Americas).
- The "new" RHDV (provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb) emerged in France in 2010 in wild and farmed vaccinated rabbits and rapidly spread in Europe and the Mediterranean basin (Malta and Tunisia), and also in Australia in 2015. According to Le Gall-Recule et al. (2013), RHDV2 did not derive from classical RHDV, but rather it originated as a 2nd emergence of unknown origin. Antigenic and disease protection data led to it being classified RHDV2 as a 2nd RHDV serotype.

The disease caused by RHDV2 has typical features: The mortality rate is lower but highly variable (5%-70%) with an average mortality of 20% in experimentally infected rabbits; death occurs in lactating rabbits from 15 days of age onward, and the course of the diseases is usually longer (3-5 days), with a higher proportion of rabbits showing subacute-chronic disease. In addition, RHDV2 is able to cause an RHD-like disease in 2 hare species: Cape hare (_Lepus capensis_ var. _mediterraneus_) and Italian hare (_Lepus corsicanus_).

There is no indication that RHDV infects humans. (Source: Spickler, Anna Rovid. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease. 2016. Retrieved from http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf. - Mods.TG/CRD
