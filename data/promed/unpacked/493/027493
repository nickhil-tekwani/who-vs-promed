It's a bacterium known as a spirochete [(_Treponema pallidum_) that] is responsible for the sexually transmitted disease known as syphilis; a big problem locally. Washoe County [Nevada]'s health department says the number of syphilis cases has nearly doubled in a year.

"[There has been an] increase in cases in other jurisdictions that surround us, California, Oregon, and Las Vegas, so we have been anticipating this for a long time and we worked on a syphilis action plan and we experienced an outbreak," says Jennifer Howell [who works] with Washoe County Health District's Sexual Health Program.

Howell says the disease is spread through sexual contact. Howell says they are seeing syphilis predominately in the homeless, IV drug users, and men who have sex with men populations at this time, but such groups can and do spread the disease to heterosexual populations. The district says there are reported cases right now where patients are becoming infected not only with syphilis, but also HIV at the same time.

[Washoe County, with a population of 421 407, is located in the north western part of the US state of Nevada. The city of Reno is the Washoe County seat and is known for its casinos. The city, with a population of 225 221 in 2010, is the most populous Nevada city outside of the Las Vegas metropolitan area (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno,_Nevada).

The news release says that Washoe County has experienced a near doubling in the number of cases of syphilis in the past year, but gives no exact data. However, an earlier report from the Washoe County Health District (WCHD) does give data for Nevada and Washoe County (Washoe County Health District EPI -- NEWS. Infectious Syphilis. 28 May 2013. 33(11): 1. Available at http://www.washoecounty.us/repository/files/4/Vol-33-No-11-05-28-2013-Infectious-Syphilis.pdf):

"Recent data on infectious syphilis in the state of Nevada and Washoe County has shown that infectious syphilis morbidity has been increasing statewide and locally. Data from 2011 indicate that Nevada holds the distinction of being ranked the 12th highest state nationally with a rate of 5.0 cases of primary and secondary (P and S) syphilis per 100 000 population. This is above the national rate of 4.5 cases per 100 000 population (Figure 1) [Figure 1, entitled Primary and secondary syphilis rates by state, United States and outlying areas, 2011, is available at the URL above]. This represents a dramatic increase from 2004, when Nevada ranked 20th in the nation, with a rate of 1.8 per 100 000. These rates are considerably above the Healthy People (HP) 2010 objective of 0.2 cases per 100 000 population. The rate among males in 2011 was 9.3 cases per 100 000 male population, considerably above the HP 2020 objective of 6.8 cases per 100 000 population.

"Washoe County has been experiencing a remarkable increase in syphilis cases in all stages over the past 3 years. Reported cases of P and S syphilis have increased dramatically, from 2 cases in 2010 to 15 cases in 2012, a 650 per cent increase. Early latent and cases of unknown duration have also increased. Two clusters involving 5 infectious syphilis cases were identified in 2012. One cluster was a married couple. The other cluster involved several homeless men. Investigation of this cluster and other early syphilis cases was challenging due to transiency, anonymous partners, multiple partners and lack of cooperation from index cases. Advances in social media and networking have impacted traditional disease investigation methods, as anonymity of the partner is easier to maintain, leaving little or no method to contact a partner.

"Therefore, the WCHD's Sexual Health Program encourages local providers to test sexually active patients for syphilis and to utilize WCHD staff for any questions or concerns regarding syphilis diagnosis, treatment, and reporting. All reported sexually transmitted diseases in Washoe County in 2012 are described in Table 1." [Table 1 reports there were 16 cases of P and S syphilis in 2012 in Washoe County or an incidence rate of 3.8 cases per 100 000 population, although the text says there were 15 cases of P and S syphilis in 2012.] - Mod.ML
