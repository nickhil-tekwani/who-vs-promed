Outbreak of _Salmonella enteritidis_ PT4 associated with shell eggs in
Ireland
---------------------------------------------------------
One hundred and ten cases of gastroenteritis, 35 of whom were admitted
to hospital, had eaten food from a Chinese takeaway restaurant in Dublin
on the same evening in October 1999. Delivery dockets for those who
ordered meals on this date were used to make telephone contact with
customers in order to estimate the extent of the outbreak and to
identify controls.
A total of 183 people were identified as having eaten
from the premises on the evening in question. At that stage, 4 days
after consumption of the food, 75 of these people reported having been
ill. A case control study found a strong association between illness and
the consumption of egg fried rice (odds ratio 8.1; 95% confidence
interval 3.1-21.0).
High rates of constitutional illness and of hospital admission showed
that considerable morbidity was associated with this outbreak.
_Salmonella enteritidis_ was isolated from 72 cases and 57 isolates were
identified as phage type 4.
_S. enteritidis_ PT4 was also isolated from the shell egg mixture used to
cook egg fried rice on the evening in question. The eggs used had been
obtained from a supplier who imports eggs from outside the Republic of
Ireland. Two weeks previously, _S. enteritidis_ had been isolated from a
shell egg obtained from the same supplier during an environmental health
inspection. Available information enabled the batch from which this egg
had come to be traced. The Irish Department of Agriculture and Food was
informed of both incidents and in turn informed the relevant authorities
of the country from which the eggs came. The Food Safety Authority of
Ireland liaised with public health authorities of the source country.
The Food Safety Authority has advised the catering industry about the
risks associated with using fresh shell eggs for raw or lightly cooked
dishes. The fast flash in the pan method used to cook egg fried rice
in Chinese cooking may not ensure that the ingredients are thoroughly
cooked. This outbreak highlights the importance of thorough cooking of
eggs.
The Irish Egg Association and An Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board, set up
an Egg Quality Assurance Scheme earlier this year. This incorporates
strict disease control and monitoring measures. The Food Safety
Authority encourages retailers and caterers to use pasteurised eggs or
obtain their eggs from salmonella controlled flocks, such as those
covered by the Egg Quality Assurance Scheme. Not all retailers and
suppliers take part in the Egg Quality Assurance Scheme. This outbreak
emphasises the importance of universal participation in such schemes.
Commercial caterers and retailers have a duty of care to their customers
to provide the safest ingredients (eggs) possible.
