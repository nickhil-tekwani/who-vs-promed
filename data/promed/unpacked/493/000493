FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE - VENEZUELA (02): SUSPECTED

As communicated by Manuel Cipriano Heredia, a veterinarian and head of the
National Livestock Breeders' Federation (FEDENAGA), to date, 37 outbreaks
of foot & mouth disease have been detected in Venezuela, 16 in them in
well-identified cattle farms in the state of Barinas.
Furthermore, stated Heredia, the regional authorities of the state of
Barinas do not enforce the quarantine measures imposed some days ago in
several cattle farms in the area mentioned. FEDENAGA is aware of another
outbreak of type O FMD virus in the parish of Tulio Febres Cordero, state
of Merida. Heredia insisted that this [sero]type of the disease [virus] was
characteristic of the state of Yaracuy until about 5 years ago, when it was
'controlled' and that therefore, it is presumed that it was carried to the
Andes region by cattle purchased in infected areas. The situation indicates
that there is no control over the movement of animals inside the country.
He emphasized the urgency of the imposition of quarantine measures in each
of the infected cattle farms, as well as an intensive campaign of
vaccination of the animals so that more severe, short-term consequences may
be avoided.

[The described situation, if accurate, is cause for concern for Venezuela
as well as for neighboring countries. The states of Barinas, Merida, and
Yaracuy are situated in northwestern Venezuela.
The last FMD report from Venezuela to OIE, published 7 Feb 2003, was
derived from a monthly report of November 2002. It can be found at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_33.HTM#Sec4>. It mentions 8
outbreaks in bovines (and one in ovines), 4 of which were in the State of
Merida and 4 in the State of Zulia. In a previous report to the OIE, the
Venezuelan authorities notified the identification of FMD virus serotype A
in one of the outbreaks, sampled in Merida on 24 Oct 2002 (see:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_42.HTM#Sec0>).
In a written annual report received by the OIE during May 2003, the
following information was included [translated from Spanish]: "At present,
personnel are being trained for FMD control. In the period 2002-2003, in an
effort to further strengthen the epidemiological surveillance in the
country, a significant number of veterinarians have been trained to take
the appropriate measures in these instances. As part of the FMD vaccination
campaign, the cycles are evaluated bi-annually, with a regional program in
place, based on the distribution of livestock. Regarding the biological
agent used for vaccination, a methodology for the control of the strength
of the vaccine to be applied has been implemented." - Mod.AS]
