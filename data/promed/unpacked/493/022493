The cattle disease theileria is establishing itself in this district [Gisborne district, Gisborne region] and has already killed some stock.

Further deaths are expected, along with productivity losses. Gisborne veterinarian Dr John Meban describes it as posing the most significant challenge the industry has faced during his time here. The Gisborne-East Coast-Wairoa area has been identified as an at-risk area for some time.

"The disease has so far affected about 6 properties in this district, but only 5 are confirmed as having the new Ikeda strain," said Dr Meban, of Eastland Vet Services. "Cattle have died here because of it and on one property the number of deaths has been significant. We suspect that property has had infected cattle on it for the past 6 to 9 months," he said.

Outbreaks of the tickborne blood parasite have occurred from Northland down to King Country. The Waikato has been particularly hard hit.

Gisborne vets met with a disease investigator from the Ministry of Primary Industries and a vet from Waikato in Gisborne recently, to discuss the situation. "We are in the very early stages of it here. There is no movement control and it's too late now to do anything to limit its entry, as it is well established elsewhere," Dr Meban said.

There was an air of inevitability that it would eventually become endemic here because of the huge tick population on farms, he said. "It has to be the most significant challenge we have faced in terms of animal health in this district. There will be further cattle deaths and there will be losses in productivity."

The theileria parasite invades red blood cells of cattle and causes them [red blood cells] to be destroyed. That causes anaemia (low red blood cell volume) in cattle. Red blood cells are important for carrying oxygen around the body. "Signs of the disease include lethargy, pale udders, pale gums, decrease in production and death. Animals can either build up immunity or develop the disease during periods of stress," a VetEnt spokesman said.

"It is spread by ticks -- these can be infected ticks brought on to the farm by a carrier animal, or a tick on the farm becoming infected from an already infected animal. Note that it is not spread by cow to cow contact," he said. Dr Meban said the disease can be diagnosed with blood testing and it is treatable.

"But the drug used to treat it is quite expensive, and comes with strict conditions on its use. Farmers who bring cattle into the district are urged to treat for ticks on arrival and quarantine them for 7 days," Dr Meban said. "Increased tick control is one of the most useful things all farmers could do, whether their cattle have been exposed to theileria or not."

In terms of ongoing prevention, farmers should ensure cattle are well fed and minimise their stress levels. "Do that and you should minimise the impact of the disease. If you are purchasing animals from known infected areas, or have animals you suspect may be infected, contact your vet for advice."

Dr Meban said there were exotic strains of theileria in the tropics that killed 90 per cent of infected animals. "The Ikeda strain is described as having a low to moderate ability to cause disease and falls into the benign classification of theileria bugs [protozoa]."

The disease had the greatest impact on 1st introduction. "After it is introduced into an area, as has happened here, the effects are lower grade. But they are potentially ongoing, with the occasional flare-up if cattle immunity drops for some reason or other," he said. The main thing was to limit the initial impact by controlled exposure. "Farmers need to work together and co-operate to restrict the effects of this disease."

[The New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) was contacted for a comment on this particular issue.

"We would like to reaffirm that what we are dealing with here is _Theileria orientalis_ (Ikeda strain). Readers are referred to the previous MPI clarification published by ProMED-mai; (archive no. 20130925.1966132) in [September 2013], which provides background information on this organism in New Zealand."
