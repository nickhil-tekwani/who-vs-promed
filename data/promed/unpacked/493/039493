At least 74 children have died following an outbreak of measles in Afghanistan's northern province of Badakhshan, a provincial official said on Sunday [6 Feb 2022].

"There had been pockets of measles cases across several Badakhshan districts, including Kuf Ab, Darwaz, Kohistan, as well as provincial capital Faizabad city and its outskirts in the past 2 months. At least 74 children died after being infected with the disease in Kuf Ab and Kohistan districts," Maazudin Ahmadi, head of the provincial Information and Culture Directorate, told Xinhua. Most of the children who lost their lives were living in areas without the access of public health workers and local mobile vaccinators.

The provincial health officials have repeatedly called on the population to stay vigilant and to consult the nearest health centers in case of children's symptoms, including fever, generalized rash, conjunctivitis, cough, and cold. According to local officials, there has been a steady rise in measles cases in the Asian country, particularly in the mountainous north eastern region.

["Afghanistan faces raging measles outbreak: WHO (November 2021)
----------------------------------------------------------------
"A raging measles outbreak has sickened thousands and killed nearly 100 in crisis-ravaged Afghanistan this year, the World Health Organization said Friday [12 Nov 2021], warning that many more would die without urgent action.

"The UN health agency said the outbreak was particularly concerning since Afghanistan is facing surging food insecurity and malnutrition.

"'For malnourished children, measles is a death sentence,' WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told journalists in Geneva via video-link from Kabul. She stressed the need to urgently scale up disease surveillance and testing in the country, but said that even without sufficient monitoring, it was clear that 'a measles outbreak is raging'.

"'We have seen higher numbers of cases this year, and we are seeing new cases every day,' she said. Since the start of the year [2021], more than 24 000 cases of the highly contagious disease have been diagnosed clinically in Afghanistan, including 2397 laboratory-confirmed cases. 'Sadly, we've had 87 deaths reported,' Harris said, warning that 'we will see so many more if we don't move on this quickly.'

"The United Nations has repeatedly warned that Afghanistan is on the brink of the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with more than half the country facing 'acute' food shortages and winter forcing millions to choose between migration and starvation.

"Harris said on Friday [12 Nov 2021] that over 3 million children under the age of 5 in the country are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition by the end of this year [2021]. More than 1 million of them could suffer from the most severe form of malnutrition and risk dying. Harris said the WHO did not have specific numbers for how many children have already died from malnutrition in the country. But she said the agency staff was hearing anecdotally of a number of cases and seeing devastating scenes in health centres treating severely malnourished children.

"'It is happening, and it is happening now,' she said."

"Malnourished children experience more severe measles infections at a greater frequency than well-nourished children. In Africa, the mortality rate for measles infection is 25-50% in infants and young children with edematous malnutrition. There is some evidence that the altered immune responses of malnourished people permit widespread viral infection."

"The more extensive viral invasion of tissues and widespread inflammation and cell death in malnourished children infected with measles may contribute to the generation of more complexes and consequent immunosuppression, in turn resulting in secondary infections."
(https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article-abstract/40/7/203/1927842?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

"Measles is an important acute childhood viral infection having severe consequences on the nutritional status. The adverse nutritional effects of measles are experienced by both the well-nourished and the malnourished children. However, the severe nutritional deficiencies like kwashiorkor/marasmus are precipitated only in children who are already malnourished. As high as 3-4% of children with measles suffered from these clinical nutritional syndromes in their post-measles period."

"Measles vaccination is the major preventive measure. However, timely use of local antibiotic therapy to the eyes and administration of vitamin A supplements offer protection to the child who already has measles. Response of malnourished children to live attenuated measles vaccine has been found to be safe and effective. Neither malnutrition nor tuberculosis, which are widespread among malnourished children of developing countries, appear to be contraindications for measles vaccination. Thus, the beneficial effects of the measles vaccination should be fully exploited by adequate supply of potent vaccine and coverage of all susceptible children."
(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8675238/)

The lack of public health infrastructure added to severe food insecurity in Afghanistan exacerbate infectious diseases. The ability to respond even to vaccine-preventable diseases is seriously compromised. It is critical to get vaccines into the regions where access is understandably difficult. - Mod.LK

[2] USA (Virginia) potential exposure
Date: Mon 7 Feb 2022
Source: Outbreak News Today [abridged, edited] http://outbreaknewstoday.com/virginia-potential-measles-exposure-in-fairfax-county-97885/


In Fairfax County, Virginia, officials are working to identify people who may have been exposed to a person with measles. Listed below [see source URL above] are the dates, times, and locations of the potential exposure sites associated with the confirmed case of measles.

Measles is a highly contagious illness that is spread through coughing, sneezing, and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of an infected individual. Measles symptoms usually appear in 2 stages. In the 1st stage, most people have a fever of greater than 101 degrees F [38 deg C], runny nose, watery red eyes, and a cough. The 2nd stage begins around the 3rd to 7th day when a rash begins to appear on the face and spreads over the entire body.

Based on the date of exposure, we have determined that if you were infected with measles [from this person], you might develop symptoms as late as 24 Feb 2022.
