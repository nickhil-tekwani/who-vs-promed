When more than 2000 camels perished in Saudi Arabia this year [2007],
the mysterious die-offs caused a nationwide furor. Investigations
were launched, and camel "beauty contests" suspended. And when
evidence mounted that the killer was not an infectious disease but
rather a toxic substance in the animals' feed, a government council
demanded punishments and reforms.

But just as scientists in North Africa and the Middle East are
expanding research into these seemingly impregnable desert
juggernauts, the animals appear to be increasingly vulnerable to
disease and toxins. Although epidemiological data are scarce --
especially in the camel-rich but politically troubled nations of
Somalia and Sudan -- some scientists argue that the illnesses
striking camels are changing. "We are seeing new diseases in camels,
and we often don't have a good explanation," says Bernard Faye, chair
of the newly formed International Society of Camelids Research and
Development (ISOCARD).

In North Africa, there have been several unexplained dromedary
die-offs during the past decade, but the incidents have not shown a
consistent pattern so far. In the late 1990s, hundreds of camels
perished in Ethiopia, followed by isolated incidents of dying animals
showing similar symptoms -- pneumonia and fevers, for example -- in
Kenya and Sudan over the past 7 years. Faye, who is working with
Kenyan scientists to investigate the deaths there, says a small
ruminant virus that normally infects cattle and sheep was the likely
cause, but other pathogens were also found in the dead animals. "The
biggest problem is getting blood and organ samples," says Faye, a
veterinary scientist with the French Agricultural Research Centre for
International Development in Montpellier.

Another scourge of dromedaries, camelpox, is also a perennial
suspect. The disease has been controlled with a vaccine in some
regions, but Saudi scientists say it does not protect all camel
populations. Other persistent or emerging camel diseases being
scrutinized by North African investigators include tuberculosis,
sleeping sickness [Trypanosomiasis], brucellosis, and rotavirus
infections. There are no vaccines for such camel diseases, complains
biochemist Mohamed Bengoumi of the Hassan II Institute of Agronomy
and Veterinary Medicine in Rabat, Morocco.

In both North Africa and the Middle East, scientists have also noted
an increase in the number of "food intoxications," camel deaths or
sickness caused by harmful substances in plants or in the livestock
fodder the animals eat. Bengoumi says camels are highly susceptible
to high-nitrogen plants as well as fungal mycotoxins, neither of
which are typically found in dry regions.

Although mysterious camel deaths have occurred elsewhere in the
Middle East and North Africa, no recent event matches the extent of
this year's [2007] Saudi die-off, during which at least 2000
dromedaries perished in a region mainly south of Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. One unofficial estimate placed the death toll at 5000.

Initial reports focused on the possibility of an infectious disease
or intentional poisonings. But after an investigation by the nation's
agriculture ministry -- which sent camel blood and fodder samples to
both Saudi and outside labs -- government officials asserted that the
camels succumbed to contaminants found in their bran fodder: the
antibiotic Salinomycin, a supplement in chicken feed that is toxic to
camels, and a fungal species whose mycotoxins can damage some
animals' nervous systems.

The Saudi government has shared few details of its investigation with
outside experts, which has puzzled camel scientists, who felt they
could have contributed. "Many questions remain open," says Faye. He
suggests that the deaths may involve several factors, possibly
including viral infections that suppress camels' immune systems. But
Saudi Arabia's deputy agriculture minister for research, Abdullah
Al-Obeid, says the lab tests showed no evidence of infectious
disease. Steps are now being taken to improve the transport and
storage of fodder for the nation's half-million camels, he says.

Although Wernery's lab hasn't yet studied tissue samples from the
recent deaths, he says "neither mycotoxins nor any known disease
could have killed 5000 camels in that short span of time." He favors
the antibiotic explanation, noting that the Saudi die-off appeared
similar in symptoms to the deaths of about 120 racing camels in Dubai
a few years ago. The cause was also later determined to be
Salinomycin in the fodder.

Whatever its origins, the Saudi debacle may help energize camel
studies in the region. ISOCARD has been attracting new members, and
Sudan has opened a camel research lab in Khartoum. In Saudi Arabia,
Al-Obeid says his ministry plans to strengthen camel research, which
is underway at several centers, including King Faisal University,
where infectious-disease expert Abdulsalam Abdulan Bakhsh is
investigating camel maladies.

Also, in January 2008, the newest phase of the Camel Breeding,
Protection, and Improvement Center -- built with help from the U.N.'s
Food and Agriculture Organization -- will open in northern Saudi Arabia.

[Though viral diseases do not seem, apparently, to have played a
major role in the recent mass-mortality event in Saudia, this is
still to be definitely proven. The presence of such viruses within
the large camel population in Saudi Arabia should be of concern and
deserves enhanced attention, particularly if zoonotic and then during
the Hajj period. One of such viruses is the Alkhurmah virus. Amongst
those in the field, it is thought that the Alkhurmah virus, regarded
as being highly pathogenic for humans, is under-diagnosed. Recent
research has led to a conclusion that this human hemorrhagic fever
virus is transmitted by ticks which feed on camels. For reference,
see the paper "Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Ornithodoros
savignyi Ticks" by Remi N. Charrel et al, in Emerging Infectious
Diseases Vol. 13, No. 1, January 2007 (available free on-line at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/13/1/pdfs/153.pdf>.

In view of the potential public-health aspects of the recent camel
mass mortality in Saudi camels, be it by harmful residues or/and
pathogens, official information on the accumulated findings is to be
recommended. - Mod.AS]
