An earlier outbreak of Norwalk-like virus gastroenteritis in a military
setting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We investigated a large mid-summer outbreak of Norwalk [-like virus]
gastroenteritis at the United States Air Force Academy (Warner RD, Carr RW,
McClesky FK, et al. A large nontypical outbreak of Norwalk virus
gastroenteritis ... Arch Intern Med 1991; 151: 2419-24). We described the
outbreak as "nontypical" because frequencies of signs and symptoms were not
what we would have expected, based on published [until then] Norwalk-like
virus outbreaks; over 100 (17 per cent) of the ill cadets required hospital
admission for intravenous rehydration.
That outbreak seems to resemble the situation in Afghanistan among the
British troops: military, a more homogeneous [age and sex] population than
that of the general population, high levels of physical activity and
stress, and dehydration in a high altitude environment. In addition, at the
time of the on-site investigation, we did not find cases that could be
attributed to person to person transmission; however, some months later
when speaking with a physician who worked in the academy hospital's
emergency department [during the outbreak] I learned that there had indeed
been several cases of a clinically indistinguishable malady among his
medics, about 36 to 40 hours after they attended the cadets with the most
profuse vomiting and diarrhea.
Unfortunately, no clinical specimens were submitted from those cases! It
would appear that patients suffering from Norwalk-like viral
gastroenteritis pose a significant risk for transmitting the agent to
care-givers who do not practise universal precautions re: exposure to
vomitus and feces.
