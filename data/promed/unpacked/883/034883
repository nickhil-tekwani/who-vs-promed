Another Victorian property has had a confirmed case of Anthrax over the weekend. It is the 5th property in the Swan Hill region to have a confirmed case of anthrax in the last month [March 2017]. Agriculture Victoria has confirmed the property has business links to the other properties where anthrax was found.

According to the department, since the outbreak a month ago, there have been 28 [livestock] deaths on the 5 infected properties. A total of 20 of these deaths have been confirmed by laboratory testing as anthrax, and the other 8 deaths are awaiting results.

So far, 5851 sheep have been vaccinated and a further 710 sheep are to be vaccinated over the next few days.

Quarantine restrictions remain in place on the infected premises until 20 days after vaccination or 20 days after the last case of disease, whichever is the latter, Agriculture Victoria said.

As the report only mentions sheep vaccination I think we may assume that this 5th outbreak is on a sheep station. Plus as it is a "confirmed" case and there is a backlog of 8 samples awaiting results, it probably occurred early last week, not this past weekend [1-2 Apr 2017]. And probably the 710 sheep awaiting vaccination refer to flocks associated with the 8 "awaited results" flocks. Hopefully this epidemic is burning itself out and not actively spreading any more. One must wonder what stimulated all thus Bacillus activity in an area where it should have been quiet. - Mod.MHJ]
