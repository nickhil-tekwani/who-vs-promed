Producers effected by the Australian Strain of Newcastle disease will find
it harder to receive compensation, as the industry embraces a national
vaccination program.
Designed to stop the costly eradication program, it will follow a national
survey of poultry flocks to determine what areas are at risk of the disease.
Brigid Glanville reports: Over the past 2 years nearly 30 million dollars
has been spent on controlling Newcastle disease, by slaughtering birds once
an outbreak has occurred. Five weeks ago another outbreak happened near
Tamworth, and NSW Agriculture soon realised the disease is not eradicable.
At a meeting of agriculture ministers last week it was decided the birds on
the Tamworth farm will not be slaughtered, and therefore no compensation
will be given. The survey and vaccination program will form an interim
management scheme that Deputy director general of NSW Agriculture, Dr
Richard Sheldrake stresses is only temporary until the prevention of the
disease is fully underway.
Dr Richard Sheldrake said, "It won't be a national vaccination program in
that every bird in every shed gets vaccinated on a certain day, but what
it'll be, it be vaccinated based on where there's risk, and where its felt
vaccination is the right way to manage the disease."
