Please do not let the statement, "when the mosquito locally known as
"karacha" bites them, it is likely that the disease will occur." go
unchallenged. It is not a mosquito, but a sandfly which transmits
leishmaniasis. According to GIDEON, the vector for both cutaneous
and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in Paraguay is _Lutzomyia
longipalpis_. There is no information in GIDEON on the vector for
visceral leishmaniasis in Paraguay.

[Dr Kenneth Dardick correctly points out that it is indeed
phlebotomine sandflies, not mosquitoes, that are transmitting
leishmaniasis in Paraguay. In South America the vectors of visceral
leishnaniasis (_Leishmania donovani infantum_, sometimes called _Le.
chagasi_) certainly include _Lutzomyia longipalpis_, but also other
species such as _Lu. intermedia_ may be vectors. (_Leishmania
amazonensis_ has been reported from the extreme northeast of
Paraguay). The parasite causing canine leishmaniasis is _L.d.
infantum_, and dogs serve as the reservoir for human infections. A
problem is that dogs may become infected and even infectious without
showing any signs of the disease.
As regards cutaneous and mucocutaneous (espundia) leishmaniasis in
the Americas, there are some 10 _Leishmania_ species/subspecies
causing the disease (actual species depending on the area), but one
of the commonest is _L. braziliensis_, a vector of which is _Lu.
whitmani_.
