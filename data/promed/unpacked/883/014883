[1] Mask recommendation
Date: Tue 3 May 2022

The Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] (CDC) restated their recommendation Tuesday [3 May 2022] that travelers should still wear masks while traveling on planes, trains, and other forms of public transportation, despite a federal administration mask mandate being struck down last month [April 2022].

Why it matters: Health officials say American travelers aged 2 and up should still wear a properly fitting mask or respirator over their nose and mouth when commuting and while indoors at transportation hubs such as airports or bus stations. "We also encourage operators of public transportation and transportation hubs to support mask wearing by all people, including employees," the CDC said.

The big picture: On 18 Apr 2022, a federal judge in Florida struck down a Biden administration mask mandate for trains, planes, buses, and other forms of public transportation. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) said the same day it would stop enforcing the federal mandate.

The mandate, which had originally been set to expire on 3 May 2022, was since appealed by the Department of Justice, on the recommendation of the CDC, AP reports (https://apnews.com/article/covid-science-travel-health-business-3b819aa097b4e642a97d39f606924203).

By the numbers: Last week [22 Apr 2022], an Ipsos poll found that while masking requirements were being scaled back at many transportation hubs across the country, most Americans -- including Republicans -- were largely supportive of mask requirements.

[See the CDC recommendation for masks and travel media statement, dated 3 May 2022, at https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0503-covid-19-travel.html:

"At this time, CDC recommends that everyone aged 2 and older -- including passengers and workers -- properly wear a well-fitting mask or respirator over the nose and mouth in indoor areas of public transportation (such as airplanes, trains, etc.) and transportation hubs (such as airports, stations, etc.). When people properly wear a well-fitting mask or respirator, they protect themselves and those around them, and help keep travel and public transportation safer for everyone. Wearing a well-fitting mask or respirator is most beneficial in crowded or poorly ventilated locations, such as airport jetways. We also encourage operators of public transportation and transportation hubs to support mask wearing by all people, including employees.

"This public health recommendation is based on the currently available data, including an understanding of domestic and global epidemiology, circulating variants and their impact on disease severity and vaccine effectiveness, current trends in COVID-19 community levels within the United States, and projections of COVID-19 trends in the coming months.

"Along with staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, avoiding crowds, wearing a well-fitting mask or respirator is one of multiple prevention steps that people can take to protect themselves and others in travel and transportation settings."

"The following can be attributed to CDC Director Rochelle P. Walensky, MD, MPH:

"'CDC continues to recommend that all people -- passengers and workers, alike -- properly wear a well-fitting mask or respirator in indoor public transportation conveyances and transportation hubs to provide protection for themselves and other travelers in these high-volume, mixed-population settings. We now have a range of tools we need to protect ourselves from the impact of COVID-19, including access to high-quality masks and respirators for all who need them.

"'Additionally, it is important for all of us to protect not only ourselves, but also to be considerate of others at increased risk for severe COVID-19 and those who are not yet able to be vaccinated. Wearing a mask in indoor public transportation settings will provide protection for the individual and the community.'" - Mod.LK]

Though US COVID-19 pediatric cases have dropped significantly since the omicron surge seen in the winter months [2021-2022] -- when weekly infections topped more than one million -- the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics shows that more than 53 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported for the week ending 28 Apr 2022, an increase of about 61% from 2 weeks ago (https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/children-and-covid-19-state-level-data-report/).

This is the 3rd consecutive week of case increases for children. Since the pandemic began, at least 13 million US children have had COVID-19, with 5 million of those infections occurring in 2022.

Last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published new data showing that 75% of US children under the age of 18 years have antibodies indicative of a previous COVID-19 infection, and roughly 30% of those infections occurred during the omicron surge (https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/20170/CDC-75-of-children-adolescents-have-had-COVID-19).

The United States reported 81 644 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [2 May 2022] and 266 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases).

The 7-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases is 60 953, with 331 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html). In total, the nation has tracked 81 479 439 COVID-19 cases, including 994 236 deaths.

Globally, some of the stricter lockdown measures are easing in Shanghai, China's most populous city, with restrictions lessening in 5 of its 16 districts. Residents there have been in a tightly controlled lockdown for weeks as the country attempts to maintain a zero-COVID policy.

Reuters reports that some residents were briefly allowed to leave their homes for walks and to buy groceries (https://www.reuters.com/world/china/some-shanghai-come-out-air-beijing-resumes-mass-covid-tests-2022-05-03/).

Elsewhere in China, the city of Zhengzhou -- population 12.5 million -- was put on a week-long restriction, and Beijing officials announced they will keep schools closed another week after the Labor Day (May Day) holiday ends tomorrow [4 May 2022]. Visitors to that city will also be required to show a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours of arrival.

[3] Cognitive issues
[A] Severe COVID and cognitive deficits

Cognitive impairment from severe COVID-19 is equivalent to losing 10 IQ points or 20 years of aging, and any recovery is slow at best, suggests a small study published late last week in eClinicalMedicine (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(22)00147-X/fulltext).

A team led by Imperial College London and University of Cambridge researchers tested 46 COVID-19 patients admitted to a single hospital 6-10 months earlier, from 10 Mar 2020 to 31 Jul 2020, and matched controls. Sixteen of the COVID-19 patients (34.8%) had required mechanical ventilation.

Participants underwent computerized cognitive assessment at an average follow-up of 6 months after their initial infection. The researchers transformed scores from patients and controls into standard deviations (SDs) from expected scores for participants' age and demographic characteristics and calculated global accuracy and response time composites.

The team used linear modeling to predict composite score deficits from illness severity, mental health status at assessment, and time since hospitalization compared with scores from normal age-related cognitive decline and early-stage dementia.

Relative to controls, COVID-19 survivors were both less accurate (G_SScore, -0.53 SDs) and slower in responding (G_RT, +0.89 SDs). COVID-19 severity, rather than mental health status, significantly predicted deviation from expected scores.

The tasks most affected by COVID-19 dealt with higher cognition and processing speed, which was qualitatively different from those of normal aging and dementia but comparable to those of advancing from the age of 50 to the age of 70. The patients' deficits began to lessen over time since infection, but the trend didn't achieve statistical significance.

In a University of Cambridge press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/951275), senior author David Menon, PhD, said, "Cognitive impairment is common to a wide range of neurological disorders, including dementia, and even routine ageing, but the patterns we saw -- the cognitive 'fingerprint' of COVID-19 -- was distinct from all of these. It is very possible that some of these individuals will never fully recover."

[B] Hard-to-read COVID vaccine information
Date: Tue 3 May 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/05/news-scan-may-03-2022


COVID-19 vaccine informational material is written at more than a 10th-grade reading level and thus is far too difficult to understand for the average American, researchers from the Mayo Clinic concluded in a study published today [3 May 2022] in Vaccine (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X22005461).

At least 25% of the US population currently has very low-level reading skills and is unable to comprehend a bus schedule or medication and cleaning-product labels, the authors said.

Two study authors independently analyzed the readability and formatting metrics of each document (factsheets for the Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and vaccine information on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] websites) using Microsoft Word readability tools and calculators. They based their assessments on 3 standard reading comprehension metrics used for educational materials.

For the general population, a 7th-grade reading level is required for understanding educational material. The researchers found at least a 10th-grade education would be required to understand the materials from vaccine manufacturers, and most of the material on the CDC websites.

"Our study demonstrates that a significant portion of the US general public is unable to comprehend the available vaccine information in the documents we studied," the authors concluded. "Given the importance of these documents to inform and build trust within the community regarding COVID-19 vaccines, greater effort must be applied to improve the readability of these information documents."

[4] Omicron: escape antibodies
Date: Mon 2 May 2022

Citation: Cao Y, Yisimayi A, Jian F, et al. BA.2.12.1, BA.4, and BA.5 escape antibodies elicited by omicron infection. bioRxiv. 2022.04.30.489997; https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.04.30.489997
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
---------
Recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages BA.2.12.1, BA.2.13, BA.4 and BA.5 all contain L452 mutations and show potential higher transmissibility over BA.2.

The new variants' receptor binding and immune evasion capability require immediate investigation, especially on the role of L452 substitutions.

Herein, coupled with structural comparisons, we showed that BA.2 sublineages, including BA.2.12.1 and BA.2.13, exhibit increased ACE2-binding affinities compared to BA.1; while BA.4/BA.5 shows the weakest receptor-binding activity due to F486V and R493Q reversion.

Importantly, compared to BA.2, BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5 exhibit stronger neutralization escape from the plasma of 3-dose vaccinees and, most strikingly, from vaccinated BA.1 convalescents.

To delineate the underlying evasion mechanism, we determined the escaping mutation profiles, epitope distribution and omicron sublineage neutralization efficacy of 1640 RBD-directed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), including 614 isolated from BA.1 convalescents.

Interestingly, post-vaccination BA.1 infection mainly recalls wildtype (WT) induced humoral memory and elicits antibodies that neutralize both WT and BA.1.

These cross-reactive NAbs are significantly enriched on non-ACE2-competing epitopes; and surprisingly, the majority are undermined by R346 and L452 substitutions, namely R346K (BA.1.1), L452M (BA.2.13), L452Q (BA.2.12.1), and L452R (BA.4/BA.5), suggesting that R346K and L452 mutations appeared under the immune pressure of omicron convalescents.

Nevertheless, BA.1 infection can also induce new clones of BA.1-specific antibodies that potently neutralize BA.1 but do not respond to WT SARS-CoV-2, due to the high susceptibility to N501, N440, K417 and E484.

However, these NAbs are largely escaped by BA.2 sublineages and BA.4/BA.5 due to D405N and F486V, exhibiting poor neutralization breadths. As for therapeutic NAbs, LY-CoV1404 (Bebtelovimab) and COV2-2130 (Cilgavimab) can still effectively neutralize BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/BA.5, while the S371F, D405N and R408S mutations carried by BA.2/BA.4/BA.5 sublineages would undermine most broad sarbecovirus NAbs. Together, our results indicate that omicron can evolve mutations to specifically evade humoral immunity elicited by BA.1 infection.

The continuous evolution of omicron poses great challenges to SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity and suggests that BA.1-derived vaccine boosters may not be ideal for achieving broad-spectrum protection.

- The Americas region reported 17.7% of cases and 20.9% deaths during the past 24 hours having reported more than 153.25 million cases, 2nd to the European region, the most severely affected region. The USA reported 44 027 cases in the last 24 hours followed by Brazil, Canada, Puerto Rico, and Chile, all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Peru and Panama reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. Argentina, Mexico, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Uruguay, among others, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 33.6% of cases and 50.4% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 215.42 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Spain, the UK, Ukraine, Belgium (5 cases), Switzerland, Sweden, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 11 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours, with no countries reporting more than 100 000 cases, 2 reporting more than 10 000, and 9 reporting over 1000 cases, while 4 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported no cases and deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.70 million cases. Overall, the reporting from the region has declined considerably over the last few days, and whether this is attributable to reduced reporting on account of Ramadan and Eid-ul Fitr, or an actual reduction, should become clear in the coming weeks.

- The African region reported 4.0% of daily cases and 1.3% of deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.79 million cases. Réunion (10 931) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by South Africa. Most of remaining (9 reporting) countries reported below 25 or lower number of cases. A total of 39 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 41.0% of daily case numbers and 17.0% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 54.91 million cases. South Korea (50 131) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours followed by Australia, Japan, China, New Zealand, Viet Nam, Malaysia, and Singapore.

- The South East Asia region reported 3.6% of the daily newly reported cases and 10.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 57.88 million cases. Thailand (9721) reported the highest number of cases followed by India (2568) and Indonesia (107). Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Maldives, and South Korea did not report any cases.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 3 May 2022, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod. UBA]

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20MAY3WORLD7_1651694734.pdf. - Mod.UBA]

[In the past 24 hours, 13 countries including Germany (158 213), USA (69 694), France (67 017), Italy (62 409), Spain (57 329), Japan (50 259), South Korea (49 038), the UK (35 518), Australia (35 503), Taiwan (23 134), Brazil (21 432), Switzerland (16 546), and Belgium (14 831) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 2684 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 1 May 2022 to late 2 May 2022).

A total of 33 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 18 of the 33 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, none are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 24.5%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 11.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 23.5% increase in daily reported cases and 12.5% decrease in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases with slight upsurge in deaths (USA has shown an increasing cases trend over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.74 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 514.68 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.26 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
