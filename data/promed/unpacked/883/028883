In eastern Switzerland, fireblight infections have been reported regionally. Canton Graub√ºnden (Grisons) reported cases of fireblight in home gardens. In canton St Gallen, mostly single infections on specific varieties are being detected, but some orchards reported medium levels of disease severity.

In canton Thurgau, there have been reports of fireblight on apple, pear, and quince. Mostly high-stem trees were affected that already had been infected previously and were pruned in attempts to control the disease. One pear orchard had to be cleared completely causing damages of approximately CHF 50 000 [about USD 52 500]. The other infections reported so far could be managed by pruning and orchard sanitation.

Canton Zurich also reports isolated cases, particularly in the southern parts with higher altitudes. There fireblight has occurred in 2 orchards, which now need to be treated. So far there has been no clearing of trees. Quinces are very badly affected. It is assumed that there will be more reports, possibly also in hawthorn which flowered at the same time as the fruit trees in the current 2020 season.

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince, and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and wild species (such as hawthorns) serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections. The pathogen is included in the A2 quarantine list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood).

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is controversial (see also ProMED-AMR post 20200625.7503355).

Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk. The pathogen is considered a major biosecurity risk in areas where it does not yet occur. A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.

In Switzerland, fireblight has been spreading rapidly since 2007. In 2008, streptomycin was officially approved to fight the disease, with some restrictions, but this decision caused opposition from environmental groups (ProMED-mail post 20080729.2310). New regulations relaxing compulsory phytosanitary measures to be taken on detection of infections have recently been introduced (see links below) for areas with low fireblight incidence. While compulsory certification for freedom of fireblight for planting material will remain nationwide, the effects of relaxing control measures for existing plantings in parts of the country will remain to be seen.
