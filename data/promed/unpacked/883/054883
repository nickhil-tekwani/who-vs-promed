A warning that a major epidemic of new variant CJD remains a strong
possibility is given today by a scientist at the forefront of research into
mad cow and other spongiform diseases.
Prof John Collinge of St Mary's Hospital, London, a member of the [UK
Government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, writes on "human
BSE" in the The Lancet and concludes it is logical "many more cases must
result". He greets the recent optimism that the human BSE epidemic may be
levelling out with caution, given that it has been only three years since
new variant CJD was recognised.
Prof Collinge is pessimistic because he estimates the incubation time for
the disease -- the time between infection with BSE and the development of
the devastating brain disease CJD -- is probably a matter of decades rather
than years. Studies of related spongiform diseases, such as kuru, suggest
incubation periods of up to 40 years.
