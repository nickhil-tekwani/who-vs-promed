MYCOBACTERIUM ULCERANS - IVORY COAST
************************************
[What follows are two postings on _M. ulcerans_ the causative agent of
Buruli ulcers. The first is a copiously edited version [reduced by 50% to
include facts] of a Reuters story and the second was provided by Steve
Berger upon our request. He used the GIDEON software to obtain current
information on _M. ulcerans_ . The information content between the two
postings is not terribly different but the style, innuendo and "scare
index" of the two information packets couldn't differ more widely. To
quote my brother, who is visiting, the first article is the "stuff of the
Saturday Night Horror Show." The gap between the headline grabbing article
probably written by an aspiring journalist and the clinical and
epidemiological summary provided by Steve Berger shows just how complex the
risk communication aspect of emerging disease will prove to be. - Mod. pc]

Abidjan, Ivory Coast -- A flesh-rotting germ lurking in the soil of Africa
has been stirred up by destruction of the tropical forests and is attacking
people as never before, doctors say.
Buruli, a virulent African version of a flesh-eating bacterium that
surfaced in Western hospitals in the 1990s, strips away skin by destroying
blood vessels with toxins to expose huge areas of gangrenous flesh.

"It was probably already there but environmental disaster has awakened it,"
he [who? - mod. pc] said after taking WHO director Hiroshi Nakajima on a
June fact-finding tour of clinics.
The total number of cases is unknown but European and African researchers
want Buruli ulcer put on WHO's top category for tropical disease research
funding, alongside malaria, sleeping sickness and yellow fever. In Ivory
Coast alone, where a world symposium on Buruli ulcer is planned for
February 1998, the bug has infected 6,000 people -- from just two when it
began to emerge 15 years ago following a spate of post independence dam
building and logging. Buruli ulcer tends to attack women working fields
around villages, along with their young children, who play in soil nearby.
Dr. Jean Marie-Kanga, chief dermatologist at Abidjan's university hospital
said the antibiotic Rifampicin used in leprosy treatment killed the
bacteria in test tubes. "There is no treatment for humans even though it
works in vitro," he said at his laboratory, where U.S.-based Centers for
Disease Control researchers are lending a hand.

Mycobacterium ulcerans (formerly Mycobacterium buruli) is a slowly-growing
non-chromogenic bacterium that is negative for most of the classical
in-vitro tests used for mycobacteria: Growth at 45 C; Catalase; Nitrate
reduction; Pyrazinamidase; Arylsulfatase; Tween hydrolysis; Growth in 5%
NaCl; Iron uptake; and growth at 37 C.
Human disease is probably acquired from direct contact with water or
vegetation. Following
an incubation period of 3 weeks to 3 months, the patient develops a slowly
growing, painless
ulcerative nodule with undermined edges. Lymphadenopathy is usually not
present. In most
cases, a single leg lesion involving the extensor surface is present;
however, the face and trunk may be involved in children. Typical therapy
for adults consists of excision as needed; and a combination of rifampicin
and amikacin (or ethambutol and sulfamethoxazole/ rimethoprim) for 6 weeks.
Children may be given rifampicin 20 mg/kg/day with amikacin 7.5 mg/kg q12h
X 6w.
Mycobacterium ulcerans infection is known as 'Buruli ulcer' and was first
described in
1948 in Australia. The disease is found in Africa (and named for Buruli
County, Uganda),
Latin America, New Guinea, Malaysia, Sumatra and Australia.
In Australia, the infection is known as 'Bairnsdale ulcer' and is endemic
to the northern territory and east coast - Victoria (East Gippsland,
Western Port and Mornington Pennisular). 25 cases were reported from
Phillip Island (Victoria) during 1993 to 1994 - apparently acquired from
water used to irrigate a golf course. 45 cases were reported from the
Western Port and Mornington Peninsular regions of Southern Victoria during
1980 to 1995. In nearby Papua New Guinea, the disease is most common in
East Sepik and Kumusi River region.
GIDEON also found another other cause of 'jungle rot':
By the way, Buruli ulcer should not be confused with Tropical phagedenic
ulcer. The latter is ascribed to dual infection by bacteria in the genera
Fusobacterium and Borrelia and is
acquired through minor skin trauma in tropical areas. The condition is
characterized by a deep, painful, foul-smelling ulcer (usually of the leg)
with undermined edges. Secondary
infection by other microbes may follow. Therapy consists of Systemic
penicillin; with excision/debridement as necessary.
[BTW for anyone who is impressed, as I am, with the working of the GIDEON
software, it is available for purchase through a special ProMED-mail offer.
Some of the money goes to support ProMED-mail. Please contact Steve Berger.]
