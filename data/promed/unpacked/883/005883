Newcastle disease continues to spread
-------------------------------------
Virulent Newcastle disease is continuing to spread and residents in
the newly affected areas are concerned about the effects of the
disease on birds and humans.

Dr Victor Gongora, director of Animal Health, Belize Agricultural
Health Authority: "We have been responding to different calls from
farmers that have reported that they have sick chickens. Of course
some of these sick chickens can be showing symptoms of other diseases
and not Newcastle. Our concern is that it is not something [like]
influenza or other exotic disease. We do respond to the calls and
investigate properly. So far we have been identifying cases in the
Belize District, Cayo District, and the Stann Creek District. In the
Belize District it is only from Burrell Boom, and we have a report
from Double Head Cabbage. In the Cayo District I would say most of
the villages have infected birds. They are calling us for
vaccination; it is not because they have a problem, they just want to
prevent it. Because of the Christmas [holiday] the labs are closed
but as soon as the holiday is over we will have the vaccines
available through the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry will
be vaccinating."

Once the birds have been infected with the disease, there is no real
treatment to prevent death. Doctor Gongora lists some of the symptoms
of the disease: "The clinical signs of Newcastle disease include
looking sick and death follows very quickly. So within a day your
sick chickens will be dead. The other ones we are noticing are
swollen heads; they may be gasping and a lot of farmers reported
hearing a respiratory sound coming from the birds. Shortly after the
farmer hears that sound the bird collapses and dies. Other clinical
signs include a green diarrhea. Basically it is a upper respiratory
disease."

Dr Gongora also points out the fact that the only way to fight the
disease is to vaccinate birds, which are not yet infected. There is
no treatment to prevent death so once a bird becomes infected, it
dies soon after.

According to Dr Gongora those who handle infected birds have
complained of a mild eye infection but the disease does not affect
humans in any other way.

"There is no problem with eating the chicken or the eggs. Sometimes
we eat the raw eggs. These things will not cause any problems. The
prevention for the disease is vaccination as well as bio-security. Do
not go and visit where you know chickens are sick and then go to your
chicken farm. The vaccines are available in Belize right now but
[only] for commercial producers. The [amount] of the vaccine is for 25
000 birds and it costs about [USD] 95.00. We will train the ministry
personnel to apply it in the different villages. These vaccines will
be applied in the eye directly to provide an immediate protection."

Those interested in getting their birds vaccinated or and finding out
more about virulent Newcastle disease can call the Belize
Agricultural Health Authority at telephone number 8-2-4-4-8-9-9.

Virulent Newcastle disease spreads to other districts
-----------------------------------------------------
Virulent Newcastle disease, a very contagious bird disease, has
spread to backyard poultry in other areas in the Cayo District; it
has also spread to the Belize and Stann Creek Districts.

Dr Victor Gongora, director of Animal Health, Belize Agricultural
Health Authority: "The virulent Newcastle disease was first confirmed
in Belize in November [2008] in a poultry farm in Spanish Lookout.
Subsequently it spread to neighboring farms within the same restricted
area. We had a quarantine and we controlled movements within Spanish
Lookout but then we found out that the virus was similar to a pet bird
isolation [found] in California when they had the big outbreak in the
United States [see ProMED ref. below for 2003. - Mod.JW]. We have done
further samples in the United States and they have also shown that the
situation in Belize is similar to that which occurred back then. We
then assumed that the virus probably got to Spanish Lookout farm
through wild birds, because the [poultry] in that particular area were
not vaccinated. This made them totally susceptible and [they]
succumbed to the virulent virus."

Dr Gongora gives an idea of the control measures that must be taken.
"Once you had that infected flock, neighboring flocks would normally
get infected. One of the 1st control measures would be to completely
destroy all the birds within the 3-kilometer [1.8 mi] area. The
quarantine [area] would also be cleaned and disinfected. It will not
be easy to destroy all the birds because we do not yet have a final
compensation program. It is very difficult to destroy birds that look
healthy and not compensate. The affected farmers did agree to the
destruction of the birds."

Public health is also a major issue of concern for residents of the
affected areas. [Dr Gongora comments,] "the public has shown concern
about the public health aspect of it. They have been asking if they
can get the disease. No, it is not a human adapted virus. It is
totally for birds; humans only get a mild eye infection if they are
handling the virus. The possibility is only there if you are handling
sick birds or the live vaccine. Our experience has shown that of all
the people working with us handling a lot of sick birds, only 2
people report getting an eye infection. They were mild eye
infections."

Dr Gongora says that the spread of the virus will be studied and
backyard poultry will be vaccinated so that we can be declared free
of the virus in 3 years. Gongora also says that the disease is not
affecting the supply of turkeys.

[These are transcribed broadcasts covering news and music. Until
recently Belize was free of Newcastle and the OIE WAHID (World Animal
Health Information Database) reports for this disease in Belize still
have it absent; see
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=disease_timelines&disease_type=Terrestrial&disease_id=16&empty=999999>.

However, ND was reported in Honduras in 2007 and widespread in Mexico
throughout the country. Belize went on alert in July 2007 because of
outbreaks in Honduras, in the Copan Ruins area
(<http://www.lovefm.com/ndisplay.php?nid=6086&fromsrch=1>).

The disease has not been reported latterly in Guatemala or in El
Salvador or Nicaragua. Further informed information on what is and
is not happening in Belize would be welcome.

Belize district contains Belize City; Stann Creek is to its immediate
south; and Cayo is to the west of Belize and Stann Creek. Spanish
Lookout is in Cayo, WSW of Belize City and close to the border
with Guatemala. - Mod.MHJ]
