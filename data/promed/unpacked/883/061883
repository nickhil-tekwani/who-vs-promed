Of 830 people bitten by dogs in the city of Uige from January to 4 Jun
of this year [2009], 6 died, the supervisor of the municipal Expanded
Program of Vaccination, Pedro Guilherme Fernando, reported today,
Thursday [4 Jun 2009]. He asked the population to go urgently to the
nearest health unit as soon as one is bitten.

[Apparently, a significant rabies outbreak, with human fatalities,
continues in Angola. In the 1st 3 months of this year (2009), 93
children died of rabies in the capital, Luanda (see ProMED archive no.
20090314.1051). Now cases are occurring in the nearby province of
Uige. Failure to obtain timely post-exposure treatment may be due, in
part, to scarcity of the vaccine and anti-rabies immunoglobulin and
their relatively high cost. The most effective measure to prevent
human cases such as these is to maintain the canine population rabies
virus immune through a continuous vaccination program.
