Two people contracted anthrax in the Stavropol region. The Rosselhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Supervision] is working to identify the source of infection.

According to the press service of Rosselkhoznadzor for the Stavropol region, 2 inhabitants of the village of Solnechnodolsk have been hospitalized with suspected anthrax.

The outbreak was reported on a private farm. According to preliminary data, the source of the human disease may be meat [carcass] from sick sheep. Rosselhoznadzor is investigating the source of the infection and applying the appropriate measures to prevent spread.

"The outbreak of anthrax in Izobilnenskaya district of the Stavropol Territory is localized; there is no threat to the people," said the acting head of the district administration, Vladimir Kovreshkin, today [5 Aug 2013].

As reported by the "Caucasian Knot," on 2 Aug 2013, 2 people in the village of Solnechnodol'sk with suspected anthrax were hospitalized. On 5 Aug 2013, the diagnosis was confirmed.

The outbreak of the disease was detected in a private courtyard in the 3rd district, Solnechnodolsk, reported Vladimir Kovreshkin. According to him, 2 people are infected, a monastery monk and an employee. The affected residents are hospitalized in the infectious disease clinic of the CRH Izobilny district and regional infectious hospital in Stavropol.

"The situation is completely localized. There is no threat to people. And the Administration Head locally, within the township Solnechnodol'sk, has introduced a state of emergency," Vladimir Kovreshkin told the Caucasian Knot.

On the monastery grounds, the cattle were vaccinated; the affected area where the infected animals were located was disinfected, and contaminated materials were burnt.

On the roads leading to the village, disinfection barriers and fire-quarantine posts were set up. Traffic police officers and experts of the State Veterinary Service are on duty round the clock to prevent unauthorized movement of possibly infected cattle out of the quarantine area. All vehicles are subject to disinfection, said Vladimir Kovreshkin.

Solnechnodol'sk village is one of the largest settlements in the Izobilnenskaya area.

Eleven residents of the village of Bashkir Urals are hospitalized with suspected anthrax. For 4 of them, the diagnosis is confirmed, writes "Rossiyskaya Gazeta." The village has been quarantined, and access is monitored by the police.

Ilgiz Nizams, the chairman of the Committee on Civil Defense, Emergencies and Administration, Yanaulsky District, said that the source of infection was contaminated meat from a slaughtered animal. "Almost immediately, a 23-year-old woman presented herself to the dermatologist at the central hospital. With her were 3 more people with complaints of skin abscesses. Suspecting anthrax, these patients were sent to the infectious disease ward of the central hospital in Yanaulskogo district.

Currently, the village is under a 2-week quarantine. More than 80 residents who had contact with the infected meat are under constant medical supervision. Police have cordoned off the village with round-the-clock security and post-decontamination.

[One might ask why only cattle were post-exposure vaccinated in Stavropol when the initial problem was with exposure to contaminated mutton in an unreported ovine outbreak. According to another report (http://www.regnum.ru/news/1691775.html), they had some 140 sheep and goats, of which 100 were neither registered nor vaccinated, presumably adult stock.

Outbreaks were reported in Stavropol in 2007 and 2010 but only in cattle. Bashkortostan is new in reporting, but logically, the livestock disease has been there for some time out of official sight.

My heartfelt thanks to Natalia Pshenichnaya for the translations and to Sabine for the original reports.
