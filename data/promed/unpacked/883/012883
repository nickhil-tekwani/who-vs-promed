On Fri 21 Dec 2012 the Norwegian Institute of Public Health released new information about the gastroenteritis outbreak in Buskerud, Norway. New cases of illness have not been reported since Sun 9 Dec 2012. The Institute therefore declared that the outbreak is over.

[Enterotoxigenic] _Escherichia coli_ (ETEC) has been isolated from patients, but not from food products or water sources. Surveys, however, indicate that contaminated food products may have been the vehicle of transmission.

Both travel and non-travel associated ETEC outbreaks are uncommon in Scandinavian countries. Until recently, outbreaks caused by ETEC have not been reported in Norway.

[ProMED-mail thanks Joanne Ocampo for providing additional information about this large outbreak of gastroenteritis at a Norwegian hotel.

The outbreak affected 319 people attending a Christmas Party, but no further cases have been detected since 9 Dec 2012. Enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli (ETEC) has been isolated from patients who attended the Christmas Party at the hotel, and norovirus is no longer considered to be the culprit. The source of the outbreak remains uncertain, however, as the agent has not been isolated from food or water sources at the hotel. It is presumed, however, that a contaminated food product may have been the culprit since non-travel associated ETEC outbreaks have been uncommon in Scandinavian countries.
