If ASF was to be confirmed in Indonesia, besides the economic losses and social impact, the threat for endemic islands' Suidae species and populations could be devastating.

The systematics of _Sus_ species over the many islands is still confusing but, for instance, _Sus barbatus_, _S. celebensis_, _S. verrucosus_, and the rare _Babyrousa babyrussa_ could be mentioned.

If the virus was to pass to these populations, some of them could just be lost. Biological invasions are more harmful on islands than on continents.

The fate of ASFV from Georgia to the Philippines in 2007 and, maybe, Sumatra in 2019 is quite impressive. But, of course, the virus didn't make all this travelling alone.

[African swine fever (ASF) is a devastating hemorrhagic fever of pigs with extremely high mortality rates. In affected countries, it causes huge economic losses. It is transmitted by soft ticks in the genus _Ornithodorus_.

We thank the point raised by Dr Moutou. The potential conservation implications of this possible introduction of ASF virus should be seriously taken into account. In Eastern Europe, ASF spread into the local wild boar populations. In Southeast Asia, sea-level fluctuations since the early Pliocene created frequent island connections and isolations, which provided ample opportunities for speciation to occur. This is one reason why the area hosts the highest wild pig (family Suidae) diversity in the world. The exact number of species and subspecies of wild pigs in Southeast Asia remains an ongoing taxonomic debate. - Mod.PMB
