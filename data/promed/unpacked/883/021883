Bovine TB confirmed in 2 Alpena County herds
--------------------------------------------
Michigan officials say they've recently confirmed bovine tuberculosis
(TB) in 2 [separate] Alpena County beef herds.

State agricultural officials say today [14 Apr 2011] that bovine TB
has been detected in 52 cattle herds and 4 privately owned cervid
operations, which usually involve deer, since testing began in 1998.

A bovine TB public information meeting for cattle owners within a
10-mile radius of the herds with the 2 newly discovered cases will be
held at 7 p.m. Wed 20 Apr 2011 at Alpena Community College.

Both farms are quarantined and no cattle may enter or leave the farm
premises until testing clears the farms of bovine TB.

[When Michigan designated high risk counties, Alpena County was one
of them. So while this is a disappointment to Michigan, especially to
the producers, it is perhaps not unexpected from a management
perspective of the disease. Otherwise, this county would not be in the
high risk zone.

Michigan officials will likely be tracing the animals involved to see
what other animals may be involved. We anticipate that there could be
other herds quarantined.

In this time of budgetary concerns it will be interesting to see how
the USDA and the state of Michigan propose to handle the situation of
potentially depopulating the affected herds. - Mod.TG
