Simian malaria in a US Traveler - New York, 2008
------------------------------------------------
Four species of intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus _Plasmodium_
(_P. falciparum_, _P. vivax_, _P. ovale_, and _P. malariae_) are
known to cause malaria in humans. However, recent reports from Asia
suggest the possibility that a 5th malaria species, _Plasmodium
knowlesi_, is emerging as an important zoonotic human pathogen.
Although more than 20 species of _Plasmodium_ can infect nonhuman
primates, until recently, naturally acquired human infections of
simian malaria were viewed as rare events lacking public health significance.

When viewed by light microscopy (the gold standard for laboratory
diagnosis of malaria), many of the simian species are almost
indistinguishable from the 4 _Plasmodium_ species that cause
infection in humans [Table; see below]. Molecular techniques, such as
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), amplification, and microsatellite
analysis, are needed for definitive species determination.

This report describes the 1st recognized case of imported simian
malaria in several decades in the United States, diagnosed in 2008 in
a patient from New York who had traveled to the Philippines. Atypical
features of the parasite seen on light microscopy triggered further
molecular testing, which confirmed the diagnosis of _P. knowlesi_.

To date, all simian malaria species have been susceptible to
chloroquine treatment. Molecular analysis of certain malaria
parasites isolated from ill travelers returning to the United States
from Asia or South America can more accurately assess the burden of
simian malaria parasite infections in humans.

The 1st recognized case of naturally acquired simian malaria was a
1965 case of _P. knowlesi_ infection in an employee of the US Army
who had returned home from an assignment in Southeast Asia (1);
subsequent reports were few and unconfirmed. In 2002, investigators
in Malaysia noted an increasing number of _P. malariae_ cases with
atypical features, including increased clinical severity and higher
parasitemia (2). By using a nested PCR assay, more than 50 percent of
these malaria cases were determined to be _P. knowlesi_; none were
_P. malariae_, as originally determined by microscopy (2).

In a retrospective evaluation by the same investigators during
2001-2006, 28 percent of 960 specimens from patients in Sarawak,
Malaysian Borneo, were found to be _P. knowlesi_, after being
morphologically diagnosed most often as _P. malariae_ (3). The group
also reported 4 unusual fatalities attributed to severe malaria
caused by _P. malariae_ that was later confirmed as _P. knowlesi_ by
PCR. Additional cases of naturally occurring _P. knowlesi_ infection
in humans have been reported from Singapore (4), the Thai-Burma
border (5), the Philippines (6), Yunnan Province in China (7), and
Finland, where a returning traveler from Malaysia was misdiagnosed
initially as having infection with _P. falciparum_ (8).

Case report
-----------
In the recent US case, a woman aged 50 years with no previous history
of malaria who was born in the Philippines but had lived in the
United States for 25 years, returned to her home country to visit
friends and relatives on [17 Oct] 2008. While there, she stayed on
the island of Palawan in a cabin located at the edge of a forested
area known to be a habitat for long-tailed macaques. She had not
taken malaria chemoprophylaxis and had not used any
mosquito-avoidance measures, both of which are recommended preventive
measures for travelers to this area.

The woman returned to the United States on [30 Oct] 2008, and noted
the onset of a headache. Fever and chills ensued, and symptoms
persisted for several days, after which she sought medical attention.
In the emergency department, she was noted to be hypotensive and to
have thrombocytopenia. Examination of thick and thin malaria smears
[Figure 1; see below] was ordered, and an initial, erroneous
diagnosis of babesiosis was made by a laboratory technician. Upon
review by the laboratory supervisor the following morning, the
diagnosis was reassessed as malaria with 2.9 percent of red cells
parasitized. However, the atypical appearance of the _Plasmodium_ sp.
seen in the smears prevented a species-specific diagnosis. The woman
was treated successfully with atovaquone-proguanil and primaquine for
_Plasmodium_ of undetermined species.

An ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) blood tube and 2 stained
smears were sent to New York state's Wadsworth Center Parasitology
Reference Laboratory for confirmation of malaria and molecular
determination of species by PCR. The Wadsworth Center confirmed the
presence of atypical rings and schizonts of a _Plasmodium_ species
[Figure 1; see below], but conventional PCR targeting the small
subunit (SSU) of rRNA did not yield a product consistent with any of
the 4 species of _Plasmodium_ known to infect humans. The specimen
also was negative for the variants of _P. ovale_, which are commonly
seen in Southeast Asia. However, primers specific for the SSU rDNA of
the genus _Plasmodium_ yielded a 1055-bp PCR product that was
sequenced and noted to be a 99 percent match over its full length to
the SSU rRNA gene from _P. knowlesi_ (H strain) (9). These data
confirmed that the infection was caused by _P. knowlesi_.

MMWR editorial note:
--------------------
Several conditions need to coincide for simian species of
_Plasmodium_ to infect humans:
1. human erythrocytes must be susceptible to invasion by simian parasites,
2. humans must be near or in forests where nonhuman simians are infected, and
3. anopheline mosquitoes that feed on both humans and nonhuman
simians must be present (10).

Many areas in Asia and South America have overlapping populations of
nonhuman primates that serve as reservoirs for simian malaria and
competent _Anopheles_ mosquito vectors that are necessary to transmit
the infection to humans [Table, Figure 2; see below] (1).

For _P. knowlesi_ in Asia, the normal hosts are long-tailed and
pig-tailed macaques and mitered-leaf monkeys, which are found with
_Anopheles_ mosquito vectors of the Leucosphyrus group, enabling
transmission of infection (1). Other simian malaria species known to
infect humans include _P. simium_ and _P. brasilianum_ in South
America and _P. cynomolgi_ and _P. inui_ in Asia (1,10).

Most simian malaria infections in humans can cause mild or moderate
disease but often are self-limited, not requiring antimalarial
therapy (1). However, _P. knowlesi_, with its 24-hour asexual
replication cycle, can result in large parasite burden and severe,
life-threatening disease (3). Severe malaria imported from Asia
should alert the physician to the possibility of infection with _P.
knowlesi_. Health-care providers also should consider hospitalization
if the patient with malaria reports travel to forested areas of Asia,
where _P. knowlesi_ transmission occurs. Simian _Plasmodium_ species
are susceptible to all available antimalarials in the United States.
Although definitive diagnosis as a simian species of _Plasmodium_
cannot be made in time to guide selection of antimalarials at the
initiation of therapy, treatment for undetermined _Plasmodium_
species will effectively treat all simian species. Use of current
treatment and chemoprophylaxis guidelines are appropriate for
treating and preventing simian malaria infections in humans.

Health-care providers of patients with malaria and laboratories that
diagnose malaria imported from Asia or non-falciparum malaria from
South America should refer appropriate specimens to a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)- verified state health
reference laboratory or CDC's Division of Parasitic Diseases
Reference Laboratory for species confirmation by molecular testing.

In the United States, approximately 1500 malaria cases are reported
each year, almost all imported from areas where malaria is endemic;
approximately 200 of these cases are imported from Asia or South
America. In the United States, the potential for not recognizing a
_Plasmodium_ infection of simian origin is high because diagnosis
usually relies on microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained smears
rather than diagnosis by molecular techniques. Only a few
laboratories (including state and federal public health reference and
commercial laboratories) routinely use molecular assays, and even
fewer have the capacity to confirm simian species.

The substantial number of recent human cases of simian malaria
reported in Malaysia and the wider region (including the
travel-associated case described in this report) underscores the need
to define the scope and magnitude of the problem (2-8). Persons
wishing to send specimens for species confirmation by CDC should
collect pretreatment blood in EDTA or acid citrate dextrose blood
collection tubes. Instructions and specimen submission forms are
available online at <http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/smscs.htm>. Contact
information for local or state health department laboratories is
available at
<http://www.aphl.org/aboutaphl/aboutphls/pages/memberlabs.aspx>. As
with all suspected cases of malaria, health-care providers with
questions regarding diagnosis or treatment should call the CDC
Malaria Hotline at 770-488-7788 (Monday-Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
p.m., EST). Health-care providers seeking emergency consultation
after hours should call 770-488-7100 and request to speak with a CDC
Malaria Branch clinician.

[The cases underline the increasing importance of genotyping malaria
parasites as a control of the species diagnosis made by conventional
light microscopy of Giemsa stained blood films. Another implication
of the report is that _P. knowlesi_ seems more widespread in
Southeast Asia than previously suspected. - Mod.EP]
