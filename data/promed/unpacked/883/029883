The state has identified a 2nd case of Jamestown Canyon virus [this year (2020)], an infection transmitted by mosquitoes, in Bow.

The person, identified only as an adult, "was not hospitalized and is doing well, but experienced fever and mild neurological symptoms," the Department of Health and Human Services said in a press release.

This is the 2nd detection of JCV in the state this year [2020]. JCV is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. There are no vaccines to prevent JCV and no good treatment.

The arboviral risk level, which indicates the likelihood that a mosquito bite will transmit a disease, will be increased to high for Bow. The risk level in surrounding towns of Goffstown, Dunbarton, Hopkinton, and Allenstown will increase to moderate. The risk level for the surrounding towns of Hooksett, Pembroke and Concord will remain moderate.

"Jamestown Canyon virus is one of 3 different infections that can be transmitted through the bite of a mosquito in New Hampshire," said Dr. Benjamin Chan, N.H. state epidemiologist. "The risk for mosquito-transmitted infections will only increase through the summer and fall until there is a mosquito-killing hard frost. New Hampshire residents and visitors need to continue to take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites."

Jamestown Canyon virus is a mosquito-borne pathogen that circulates widely in North America, primarily between deer and mosquitoes, but can also infect humans. Reports in humans have been increasing over the last several years as recognition and testing for this virus has increased.

This is New Hampshire's 11th case of JCV since the 1st report of the disease in the state in 2013. Many illnesses caused by JCV are mild, but moderate-to-severe central nervous system involvement requiring hospitalization have been reported, including fatal infections.

In addition to JCV, risk for infection in NH by eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and West Nile virus (WNV) will continue to increase through the summer and fall until mosquitoes are no longer biting.

Early symptoms for all of these can include fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. More serious central nervous system disease including meningitis or encephalitis can occur with these diseases.

[This is the 2nd Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) case in New Hampshire this year (2020).

As noted previously, JCV cases are not new in New Hampshire. They were diagnosed in New Hampshire last year (2019) and in 2013, 2015, and 2017. JCV infections are extremely rare, and, if laboratory confirmed, the 2018 case was the 1st documented death due to the virus (see Jamestown Canyon virus - USA: (NH) fatal, susp 20180629.5882078).

As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and midwestern USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
