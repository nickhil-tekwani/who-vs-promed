There is no need for a Europe-wide ban on keeping poultry outdoors to stop
them getting bird flu, because there is a little risk of the virus
spreading from Russia, European Union officials said on Thursday [25 Aug 2005].
"The experts concluded that it would not be proportionate for the current
risk of disease to introduce a general ban on keeping poultry outdoors,"
British Chief Veterinary Officer Debby Reynolds told reporters in London
after a meeting of EU veterinary experts in Brussels.
"The risk of the virus spreading into the European Union via migrating
birds is remote or low," she added.
The European Commission, which chaired the meeting, asked the 25-nation
bloc to improve monitoring of EU flocks.
"The Commission has asked the member states to step up surveillance and
will make financing available in order to facilitate this effort," it said
in a statement.
There were no details on how much money will be made available.
The EU will test migratory waterfowl and encourage farmers to improve
bio-security. Existing contingency plans to deal with any outbreaks will
also be reviewed across the bloc.
The Commission urged strict border controls to avoid the import of infected
birds.
2 EU countries, Germany and the Netherlands, have decided to take measures
on their own to guard against the possible risk of bird flu arriving on
their national territories.
From this week, Dutch farmers must keep all poultry indoors to prevent
contact with migrating birds -- or build an enclosure to make contact with
wild birds impossible.
In Germany, the government has drafted emergency regulations to order
farmers to keep their poultry flocks in pens to prevent contact with wild
birds, but these have not yet passed into law.
