The San Luis Obispo County (CA) Public Health Department says that a
case of tick-borne relapsing fever has been diagnosed in a northern
San Luis Obispo County resident. The disease is relatively rare, but
is a reportable disease in California. The following is a press
release from the San Luis Obispo County Public Health Department.

A case of tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) has been diagnosed in a
San Luis Obispo County resident. TBRF is a relatively rare disease,
with approximately 25 cases diagnosed in the USA each year from
states where TBRF is a reportable disease. The case was diagnosed in
a North County resident, which is consistent with the epidemiology of
TBRF, with cases found between 1500-8000 feet [457-2440 m] of
elevation.

Cases of TBRF are characterized by fever, generalized body aches,
headaches, chills, and sweats. Relapsing fever gets its name from the
fact that the patient experiences a fever, which resolves and then
returns. Most cases of TBRF are self-resolving, although some cases
can have long-term symptoms.

The cycle of relapsing fever can occur up to 10 times, with 4-14 days
between febrile episodes [of 2-9 days] each cycle. The tick associated
with TBRF is a night feeding tick that is generally found in rodent
nests and burrows in and around sleeping areas. The rodents most
generally associated with the ticks are ground or tree squirrels, and
chipmunks.

County health officer Dr Penny Borenstein urges residents to be aware
of the hazards associated with ticks and tick-borne diseases. To
prevent exposure to the species of tick associated with TBRF, persons
should ensure that rodents and squirrels are not nesting in and
around their homes. Because the bite of the tick is relatively
painless, most persons would not know they had been exposed, but
should be aware of symptoms of the disease, and alert their physician
if they have repeated cycles of fever that resolve and then return.

[Relapsing fever is caused by a spirochete in the _Borrelia_ genus.
The _Ornithodoros_ tick vector can be seen at
<http://www.lyme.org/img/gallery/o_hermsi.jpg>.
This "soft tick" feeds over a much shorter time than the typical "hard
ticks" such as those that spread Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme
disease and, therefore, are less likely to be discovered while feeding.

The diagnosis of relapsing fever can be readily made during febrile
periods by a Wright's stain of the peripheral blood. Unlike other
spirochetes, this organism readily picks up the Wright stain. The
typical peripheral blood smear can be seen at
<http://www.kcom.edu/faculty/chamberlain/Website/lectures/lecture/IMAGE/BORRELIA.GIF>.

The relapses appear to be caused by changes in the outer protein
antigens of the organism. For additional reading on the
manifestations of the tick-borne form, references 1 and 2 are useful.

Louse-borne relapsing fever, seen primarily in Africa, has a less
benign course than its tick-borne cousin.
