The New York State Health Department is reporting 11 new cases of children with confirmed measles, bringing the total to 17. Communities in Williamsburg and Borough Park are affected. The children with measles range in age from 7 months-4 years. Three infections, including the initial case of measles, were acquired by children on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. There has also been transmission in schools with children who are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated.

There are no deaths associated with this cluster, although there have been complications including hospitalization.

To increase awareness about measles, the Health Department is sending notifications to schools, providers and hospitals with large Orthodox Jewish populations. The Department is also conducting community outreach in the affected communities, placing ads in local newspapers and distributing posters to health care providers. There has been an increase in vaccination rates in these communities since the Health Department announced the outbreak, but many more children should receive the MMR vaccine to stop measles transmission.

"The increase in measles cases in Orthodox Jewish communities of Brooklyn demonstrates the importance of getting children vaccinated on time to prevent measles and not put other children at risk," said Acting Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot. "The Health Department continues to strongly recommend unvaccinated individuals to get vaccinated now, especially before traveling internationally. If your child develops a rash or fever, contact your physician immediately and keep them home from school or child care."

"Vaccines prevent infectious diseases, including easily preventable ones like measles, and are widely available to New Yorkers at low or no cost," said Assembly Member Richard N. Gottfried of Manhattan, Chair of the Assembly Committee on Health. "Vaccination not only protects the person being vaccinated, but helps prevent outbreaks of infectious diseases - protecting babies, seniors, and those with weakened immune systems or chronic conditions."

"Vaccinating children is one of the most basic ways a parent can protect their child's health," said Councilman Chaim Deutsch. "These new cases of measles out breaking within the Orthodox community are worrisome, particularly for parents of children too young to be fully vaccinated against the measles. I urge parents who are traveling with young children to follow Health Department recommendations and vaccinate their kids. I thank the Health Department for their efforts to do outreach and spread the word to ensure New York families are protected."

"It says in the Torah "V'nishmartem Meod L'nafshoseichem", that a person must guard their health," said Rabbi David Niederman, President of the UJO of Williamsburg and North Brooklyn. "It is abundantly clear on the necessity for parents to ensure that their children are vaccinated, especially from Measles. Thankfully close to everyone in the community understands and takes very seriously their vaccination obligations. The current outbreak is a risk to the health of the children in our community and it is incumbent for everyone to have their children vaccinated. We are grateful to the Department of Health for their tireless work to end this outbreak, and we will continue to work with the City and community schools to end this serious outbreak."

"As the measles outbreak continues to spread relentlessly," said Rabbi Avi Greenstein, Executive Director of the Boro Park Jewish Community Council. "It is imperative that every member of our community protect themselves and their families by getting vaccinated. It is equally imperative to understand that prevention is key. As such, we need to take away the lesson of how important it is for every one of us to avail ourselves of modern medicine and not to trust in herd immunity, but rather to follow the vaccination schedule recommended by medical professionals to protect our families and our entire community."

Per recognized national guidelines, the Health Department recommends the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for children at age 12 months, with a 2nd dose at 4 -- 6 years old. Two doses of MMR are required to attend kindergarten through grade 12. Children attending daycare, nursery school, Head Start and pre-K are required to have 1 dose of MMR vaccine. All persons, including infants ages 6 -- 11 months should be vaccinated prior to international travel. Parents should keep ill children at home and not send them to daycare or school. If there is measles in a student, all unvaccinated children - including those with a medical or religious exemption - will be excluded and unable to attend the daycare or school for 21 days after their last exposure. ...-more

Health care providers should ensure that adults and children over the age of 6 months who are traveling outside the U.S. have documented immunity to measles. In addition to the large outbreak currently going on in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in Israel, there are large outbreaks in Europe, with over 41 000 cases of measles and 40 deaths reported in 2018. Countries most affected include Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia, Greece, Romania, Italy, France, Slovakia, Russia and the United Kingdom, although all countries in Europe have reported cases. There are also outbreaks in many other parts of the world, including countries in Asia, South America and Africa. ...-more

A free measles vaccine clinic on 2 Nov 2018 in Monsey, New York posted signs for those taking advantage of the shots to tell staff about symptoms of any illness because they could infect others.

The number of measles cases in the United States so far this year [2018] has surpassed 2017 with the potential for about a quarter of the highly contagious respiratory infections to be occurring in one New York county north of New York City.

Nationwide as of 6 Oct 2018, the most recent nationwide data available, 142 measles cases had been reported, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of people sickened, mostly unvaccinated, exceeded the 2017 total of 120 in mid-August 2018.

As of Fri [2 Nov 2018], Rockland County had 46 confirmed cases and 9 suspected cases, according to the county's health commissioner, Dr. Patricia Ruppert.

A month ago, Rockland County Health Department officials were worried about an outbreak and offering emergency measles vaccination clinics because a traveler from Israel had visited an ultra-Orthodox Hasidic synagogue and a sukkah, a temporary structure built for the weeklong Jewish festival of Sukkot, near a Jewish boys' school in New Square, New York.

"There's a component ... that are not in favor of vaccines," said Dr. Howard Zucker, New York state's health commissioner. "We need to dispel any worries that they have."

None of those infected in Rockland County were fully vaccinated, Ruppert said. The state has banned unvaccinated students from attending classes in 3 communities if their school has a vaccination rate of 70 percent or lower.

Two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, generally given at age 12-15 months with a booster at 4-6 years old, are 97 percent effective in preventing measles. One dose is 93 percent effective, according to the CDC.

While Rockland County's overall vaccination compliance rate is 94 percent, Orthodox Jewish schools in the area vary widely in vaccination rates from 40-100 percent.

The World Health Organization considers herd immunity to be achieved when a community has 95 percent of its members vaccinated. This helps protect those who cannot receive vaccinations because they are too young, have immune system problems or are too ill to get the shots.

Nationwide in the 2017-18 school year, 94.3 percent of kindergarteners in 49 of 50 states had received both doses of the MMR vaccine, the CDC said.

The outbreak in Rockland County, about 25 miles north of New York City, is one of 11 outbreaks in 25 states reported so far this year [2018]. States affected are Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington.

South Carolina is not on the CDC's most recent list; however, 3 cases have been confirmed in the past week in Spartanburg County, according to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. Three or more linked cases constitute an outbreak.

Rockland County's measles outbreak and cases in New York City -- and Bergen County and Lakewood, New Jersey -- have been linked to Israel.

An 18-month-old unvaccinated girl died from complications of measles Thu 1 Nov 2018 in Jerusalem, the country's 1st measles death in 15 years, according to The Jerusalem Post. Nearly 1300 cases in the country of 8.5 million residents have been reported so far this year [2018]; in contrast, the United States has about 329 million people.

Meanwhile, an outbreak in Europe has left more than 3 dozen dead.

General skepticism about vaccinations, including the MMR shots, continues among some, no matter where they live.

This questioning of vaccines plays out in different ways, though. Some swear off all vaccines, believing they carry more risks than the diseases they are designed to fight.

Other parents remained concerned about what they see as an overwhelming and aggressive vaccination schedule. They may want to slow the amount of shots given or skip certain inoculations. In a vacuum, they may opt out of vaccinations because they don't think their ideas will be welcome.

Ruppert said she's been talking with families who are "in between," who focus on delaying a vaccination schedule. She has found them amenable to education and explanation if their concerns are respectfully addressed.

Part of today's problem has been the success of childhood immunizations in previous generations, said Zucker, who is a pediatrician with a subspecialty in critical care. People aren't familiar with many of the diseases that killed or maimed children as few as 25 years ago; the chicken pox vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1995.

"I've seen these diseases, all of them, diphtheria to measles," he said. "I've seen the measles encephalitis; I've seen whooping cough. I don't think any parent would want to experience that with a child. I recognize the worries of this," Zucker said of parents' concerns. "But I recognize the need for vaccinations."

Because the vaccinations prevent diseases, they don't see what could happen, he said.

Complications of measles include pneumonia, brain damage, deafness and death. The disease can be dangerous, especially for babies, young children and pregnant women who haven't had the virus.

A clinic on Fri 2 Nov 2018 in Monsey, New York drew 99 people. One child was turned away because he showed symptoms of measles, Ruppert said.

Every person is triaged at the door, she explained, so any person infected doesn't end up spreading the virus at the clinic.

"If they're looking sick, they don't come in the building," she said, explaining that every person is given a quick analysis at the door so anyone infected doesn't end up spreading the virus at the clinic. She was gratified that the parents of the sick child decided to have the siblings receive the vaccine anyway.

Cusco will declare a measles emergency. Despite the fact that 72 suspected measles cases have been reported in Cusco, the Ministry of Health did not declare the region a health emergency. Authorities will request reconsideration.

In spite of the request of the health authorities of Cusco, the executive decided not to declare a health alert regarding measles to the imperial region. The decision has concerned the regional Director of Mealth, Javier Stamp Vera, because there is a significant increase in cases of this disease.

The Ministry of Health (MINSA), through a document addressed to the Regional Directorate, indicated that a national vaccination campaign will be held, so that an emergency declaration is not necessary.

To this end, a new request will be issued, where they request to reconsider the measure of the MINSA. They will also enclose reports of the 72 suspected cases of measles and the 5 confirmed cases so far.

In connection with the sudden outbreak of measles in Israel, the local Ministry of Health wants to ban children from school if parents refuse to vaccinate.

The reason is that last week in Jerusalem, an 18-month-old baby died of measles, and this is the 1st reported death from the disease in Israel for 15 years, writes The Times of Israel.

According to doctors of the capital hospital Xagħra Zedek, the baby was not vaccinated against this contagious disease. The girl might have contracted it from his parents, both of whom were diagnosed with measles, and neither of them vaccinated.

The girl's death occurred in the background of the now frequent failures of parents to vaccinate children. The failure of parents to be vaccinated is based on various unproven claims about the dangers of this life-saving practice.

The baby belonged to the ultra-ortogonales, the family of the radical sect Neturei Karta of Jerusalem.

Neturei Karta are radical anti-Zionists who refuse the services of many public services, including health, such as the national program of early vaccination of children.

This year [2018] marks the rise of measles among the Israelites, and the highest is in the ultra-ortogonales community of Jerusalem: 753 reported cases of infection. This is attributed to the failure of the radical traditionalists to vaccinate.

In 2nd place is the ultra-Orthodox community in Safed, with 213 cases registered this year [2018], followed by 89 cases in Petah Tikva and 84 in Tel Aviv.

The Minister of Health, Moshe Bar Siman-Tov, called on parents to "come and get vaccinated. This is the most important thing they can do to protect themselves from this contagious disease."

The Minister said that officials "don't want to talk about sanctions, but if we see danger for the population because of unvaccinated people, we will consider the possibility of a ban on unvaccinated children to attend school."

He stressed that such a move is not for the purpose of punishment but for "the protection of other children in the school."

Bar Siman-Tov noted that the vast majority of ultra-ortogonal families are vaccinated and that pockets of measles outbreaks in Jerusalem and Safed exist only among a small portion of the community.

According to Professor Shai Ashkenazi, Director of the Israeli Pediatric Society, measles "was on the verge of extinction, but due to the decline of vaccination made a big comeback. He urged lawmakers to make vaccination mandatory for all citizens.

A person infected with the virus [measles] can pass the disease to at least 20 persons who happen to personally touch the patient or are within the vicinity when the carrier coughs or sneezes, according to the Department of Health Center for Health Development (DOH CHD).

Although preventable by immunization, measles with its complications is still the leading cause of death among preventable diseases, Dr. Cortez added.

In 2017, DOH authorities declared a measles outbreak in Zamboanga, and another outbreak was later noted in Luzon, according to Ruff Vincent Valdevieso.

Doctors Cesar Tomas Lopez and Jeanette Pauline Arellano-Cortez said that the measles vaccine the DOH would be using has been tried and tested effective since 1970's and is still the best community protection against the viral measles infection.

With proximity to Zamboanga, the DOH-7 Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit sounded the alarm over what they perceive as danger signs of possible entry of the virus into the Visayas. A regular boat trip services Dumaguete and Zamboanga.

According to data from the RESU, from January to 27 Oct 2018, there has been a total of 305 cases of measles monitored in Central Visayas.

Of all the cases, 15% (45 patients) are from Dumaguete, 28 patients (9.1%) from Bacong Negros Oriental, 5.9 % (17 cases) from Sibulan, and in Negros Oriental and in Larena Siquijor 5.5%, RESU7 said. Cebu City this year [2018] has some 25 measles cases monitored, this is 8.1% of the cases here. The disease has also caused one death, based on reports from different disease reporting units (DRUs) of the DOH.

In 2016, the same period saw 45 cases and no deaths; that is why this year [2018], health authorities say cases are 582% higher, Valdeviesa, who is a nurse, reported.

RESU 7 also pointed out that the ages of their monitored cases ranged from 5-60 years old.

While Bohol Province has but yet 12 suspected measles cases, there is only one laboratory confirmed measles case and another rubella case, the regional center for disease monitoring shared. But with twice daily sea trips from Dumaguete to Tagbilaran, what are the chances that the disease could be spread in Bohol? High, health authorities said.

To respond to the alarming situation, DOH now brings a region-wide Supplemental Immunization Activity (SIA) in Central Visayas from 22 Oct-23 Nov 2018.

Dr. Cortez explained that the Measles Containing Vaccine (MVC), a vaccine that has been used since 1970s, would be used in the month-long activity.

Targets are children from 6 weeks (1 month and 2 weeks) to 59 months, or 4 years and 11 months, according to DOH.

[Sanofi revealed in November 2017 that Dengvaxia -- the world's 1st dengue vaccine -- might increase the risk of severe disease in people who had never been exposed to the virus. The news prompted an uproar in the Philippines, where more than 800 000 school-age children had been vaccinated in 2016. This created fear of vaccines in the country, affecting the MMR vaccine uptake by the population. - Mod.LK
