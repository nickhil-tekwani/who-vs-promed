Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola - WHO Update 10
-----------------------------------------------
As of Fri 9 Apr 2005, 214 cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever have
been reported in Angola. Of these, 194 have died. Uige Province
remains the epicenter of the outbreak, accounting for almost 90
percent of the cases and deaths.
In Uige, mobile surveillance teams resumed operations on Saturday [10
Apr 2005], following intensive campaigns to improve public
understanding of the disease. Campaigns have benefited from support
by the provincial governor and officials from the health department,
who have made personal visits to affected communities. Religious
leaders are also helping to sensitize the public.
Some improvements are already apparent. More alerts to suspected
cases and deaths are being reported directly by residents. Some 360
contacts are being followed up by the teams in Uige, but more
improvements are needed to detect cases earlier, ensure their
isolation and supportive care, and find and manage contacts.
WHO is concerned that deaths are continuing to occur within the
community, as care of patients by family members without adequate
protective equipment greatly increases the risk of further
transmission. Staff at Uige's large provincial hospital also need
training and equipment to reduce the risk that routine surgical and
laboratory procedures might endanger staff and other patients.
An isolation ward, dedicated to the care of Marburg hemorrhagic fever
patients, has been established at this hospital by Medecins sans
Frontieres. Concern arises from the risk that persons infected with
the virus might be admitted for another suspected illness and undergo
testing or treatment procedures without adequate precautions.
WHO experience with outbreaks of viral hemorrhagic fevers, including
the Ebola virus, underscores the importance of rapidly sealing off
opportunities for the amplification of transmission within health
care settings.

Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever death toll approaches 200
-----------------------------------------------
The death toll in Angola from the world's deadliest outbreak of
Marburg virus infection, with 9 more deaths, is approaching the 200
mark. The UN World Health Organization stated that, as of Sun 10 Apr
2005, the total number of cases nationwide is 218, that 193 people
have died, and added that 360 others were under surveillance in the
southern African country, where the outbreak was 1st detected in
October 2005. The death toll, based on figures compiled up to Friday
[8 Apr 2005] was 184.
Marburg virus, whose exact origin is unknown, spreads through contact
with bodily fluids, such as blood, excrement, vomit, saliva, sweat
and tears, but can be contained with relatively simple health
precautions. The outbreak in Angola has overtaken an earlier outbreak
in the Democratic Republic of Congo as the largest ever recorded of
the virus, 1st detected in 1967 when German laboratory workers in the
town of Marburg were infected by monkeys from Uganda.

Angola: health teams race to track new Marburg cases
-----------------------------------------------
Epidemiologists in the northern Angolan town of Uige are working
overtime to trace new cases of the deadly Marburg virus, which has
claimed nearly 200 lives and sparked panic in the war-devastated
southern African nation. Every morning, teams from the World Health
Organization comb the town, devastated by a 27-year civil war, to try
and pinpoint new cases of the hemorrhagic fever, which has so far
infected 218 people and killed 193 in the world's worst outbreak.
"We visit our contacts and look for suspected cases," Francois
Libama, a WHO epidemiologist told Agence France Presse (AFP), as
4x4's set out to scan the derelict town, which still bears the scars
of the bitter civil war which raged here until 2 years ago. "If we
find a suspected case, we call in the special teams to come and
remove the body," Libama said, as he drove to a home in Kakuia, a few
km from the center of the town, where a suspected case had been
reported.
A few hours later, Libama, who has done similar work during 3
previous outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, checked on 2 Marburg
"alerts" at homes where young children had died from causes other
than the feared fever. The team finds another home, where a family
had previously lost a year-and-a-half old child to Marburg a week
ago, empty. "They have left; they have gone back to their village,"
an elderly neighbor said, [adding that] the family's village was more
than 100 km (60 miles) away from Uige through thick jungle. "We have
lost them," Lubama told AFP.
Funeral teams here have been met with fear and anger and also some
superstition. "There is a lot of superstition and witchcraft. For
example, doctor Alexandre Matombo, the Uige hospital director, has
been accused by residents of causing the illness," Lubama told AFP.
Anthropologists meanwhile said the burial teams were being sensitized
to local custom and tradition. They proposed that a ritual washing of
hands after a funeral be replaced by a symbolic washing with
chlorinated water and that burial teams express condolences when they
come to take away a body and allow the family to attend the burial.
"In Africa, we celebrate the death of somebody," said Alain Epelboin,
French anthropologist of the Paris-based National Center for
Scientific Research. "With this epidemic, there is a silence around
the death ... we thought that we need to restore a kind of ritual,"
he told AFP. "When somebody dies, I explain to the neighbors how the
"astronauts" are coming to take the body away," added Julienne Anoko,
another anthropologist, referring to the burial team's full-body
protective "Ebola" suits.

A comment on the control of Marburg hemorrhagic fever
-----------------------------------------------
Medecins san Frontieres (MSF) are quoted in today's New York Times as
saying that the main hospital in Uige, Angola (and perhaps smaller
ones in that region) should be closed in order to combat Marburg
hemorrhagic fever that rages in the country. The thesis is that these
facilities are a principal source of virus transmission. [See part
(1) of ProMED-mail post "Marburg hemorrhagic fever - Angola (22)
20050410.1037" - Mod.CP]
But those who pay no attention to history are certainly doomed to
repeat it! The virtual wipe out of hospital staff during the Ebola
outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire 10 years ago led to ongoing transmission of
disease in homes where family care-givers had absolutely zero
protection against acquisition of disease once a single member became
ill. The MSF team certainly needs massive help in the current crisis,
but one thing is clear from experience: filovirus outbreaks will be
controlled only when the populace under attack has confidence in
primary medical care provided by personnel themselves confident that
they can deal with the disease and themselves survive.
Do not close the hospitals. Retool them urgently.

[Karl Johnson's warning is based on experience and should not be
glossed over without serious consideration. It is possible that the
newswires are misrepresenting the full situation and there are plans
to have independent, free standing isolation units for care of
clinical cases of Marburg in Uige and surrounding areas. The problems
inherent with leaving active cases in their home environment cannot
be overstated. The observation that the hospital(s) has been an
amplifier for transmission is in keeping with prior outbreaks of
viral hemorrhagic fevers in Africa, not unrelated to lack of barrier
protective gear and generalized shortages of gloves, syringes and
needles as mentioned in earlier discussions in this thread. In prior
outbreaks, the implementation of isolation with use of full
protective gear has lead to interruption of transmission.
From the reports coming in from the field, the challenges in front of
the health care sector for interrupting transmission in this outbreak
are great, and remain so for socio-cultural reasons.
We await results of epidemiologic studies of this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
