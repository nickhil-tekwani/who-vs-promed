Human Infection with a Triple-Reassortant Swine
Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Containing the
Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase Genes of Seasonal Influenza Virus

Abstract:
---------
A reassortant influenza A(H1N1) virus of swine
origin distinct from the pandemic H1N1 2009
strain was isolated from 3 patients, all of whom
worked at the same large hog operation in
Saskatchewan, Canada. The genomic composition of
the isolates has not been previously reported, to
our knowledge, and was the product of a genetic
reassortment between seasonal H1N1 influenza
virus and triple-reassortant influenza virus that
emerged in North American swine during the late
1990s. The neuraminidase and hemagglutinin genes
of A/Saskatchewan/5350/2009,
A/Saskatchewan/5351/2009, and
A/Saskatchewan/5131/2009 were derived from human
H1N1 virus and were closely related to those of A/Brisbane/59/2007.

[Continued surveillance should establish whether
the isolation this reassortant from the same
swine population is a unique occurrence, and more
importantly whether there has been any onward
transmission of this reassortant virus in the human population.
