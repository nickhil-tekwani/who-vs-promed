[The sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in various parts of Pakistan are continuing this year (2014). As the report above indicates, many of the CCHF cases have occurred in Sindh province. The individual described above probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can occur also. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
