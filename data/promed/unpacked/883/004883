A recent article presents evidence that a strain of bacteria that causes
stomach ulcers was spread from cat to owner. A 38-year-old dentist who had
a history of stomach problems was found to have ulcers when doctors
performed endoscopy.

Bacteriological analyses revealed that the man was infected with three
different strains of _Helicobacter heilmannii_, a bacterium often found in
animals, but rarely in humans. One strain of bacteria was identical to that
found in one of the man's two cats, according to lead author Dr. Christine
Dieterich, of Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne,
Switzerland.
A similar bacterium, _Helicobacter pylori_, is common in humans and is
known to increase the risk of gastric ulcers and possibly stomach cancer.
Treatment with antibiotics can eradicate the bacteria.

While _H. pylori_ is found only in humans, _H. heilmannii_ infects a
variety of animals, and is found in 80% to 100% of cats, dogs and pigs,
causing mild to moderate gastritis, or stomach inflammation. "The
transmission of the bacterium does not seem to be very [efficient,
however, since the prevalence of _H. heilmannii_ is very high in pets, but
fortunately very low in humans," the authors wrote. "In cats and dogs, _H.
heilmannii_ colonization is associated with mild to moderate gastritis; in
humans it cause mild gastritis, but people infected by _H. heilmannii_ have
also developed
gastric ulcers and even cancer."
The study is the first to find that humans can be infected with multiple
strains of _H. heilmannii_, according to the authors. However, there is a
small possibility that the man was infected by a previous pet and passed
the bacteria to his cat, or that they were both infected from another source.

[This raises a number of questions ... if _H. heilmannii_ is so omnipresent
in dogs, cats & pigs, why is it so apparently rare in humans, and, vice
versa, what is so special with this 38 year-old dentist for him to qualify
for infection with even one strain, much less three? - Mod.MHJ
