Information received on 23 Sep 2005 from Dr Chua Sin Bin, Director,
Veterinary Public Health and Food Supply Division, Agri-food and Veterinary
Authority of Singapore:
Report date: 23 Sep 2005.
Reason for immediate notification: emerging disease or pathogenic agent
findings that are of epidemiological significance to other countries.
Precise identification of agent: koi herpesvirus.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 22 Sep 2005.
Date of start of the event: 22 Sep 2005.
Clinical disease: no.
Nature of diagnosis: advanced laboratory tests.
Location of outbreak: Singapore.
Number of animals in the outbreak:
susceptible: 30
cases: 1
deaths: 0
destroyed: 30
Description of affected population: koi carp imported as a trial batch of
30 fish from a new source.
Diagnosis: the entire batch was submitted to the laboratory for PCR
(Polymerase chain reaction) testing for koi herpesvirus.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed (on 22 Sep 2005): Animal
and Plant Health Laboratory Division, Ava (Agri-food and Veterinary Authority).
Source of outbreak or origin of infection: legal movement.
Control measures:
A. Undertaken:
- quarantine;
- tracing back;
- surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone.
B. To be undertaken: surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone.
Treatment of affected animals: no.
Other details/comments: the entire batch of affected fish was destroyed.
Investigations revealed that there was no mixing with other susceptible
species.

[Though KHV is not included in the list of notifiable diseases, Singapore
justifiably reported it to the OIE, since it is regarded an important
emerging disease with potential of international spread. Such a
notification occurred once before (Indonesia, 2002).
Since 1998, the newly recognized Koi herpesvirus (KHV) has caused mass
mortality among common carp and koi in the USA, Israel, Germany, England,
Italy, Netherlands, Indonesia and Japan. It seems that the disease was
present but not recognised in previous years (KHV DNA was detected in
tissue samples taken in 1996, during an unexplained mass mortality of koi
and common carp in the UK).
Intensive fish culture, koi shows, and both domestic and international
trading in the absence of health certifications or inspections have
contributed to the rapid global spread of KHV. Recent investigations into
mortalities on coarse fisheries have provided evidence for the spread of
KHV into wild populations of common carp. This has become the most severe
hazard of this emerging disease. Since KHV is not a notifiable disease,
there is no requirement for exporting countries to provide any health
certification to show freedom from it.
However, in a number of countries, ornamental fish trade organisations have
introduced a number of initiatives in an attempt to control the spread of
the disease. This has included the establishment of trade networks under
which wholesalers and importers are notified when the disease is diagnosed
in batches of koi. Other initiatives include the establishment of
disease-free broodstock and the provision of quarantine facilities for
importers.
For a concise review of the KHV situation in the UK during 2004, refer to
page 30 in Trout News No. 40 (July 2005), published by Cefas (UK's Centre
for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science).
<http://www.cefas.co.uk/publications/troutnews/tnews40.pdf>.
According to FAO statistics, the world cyprinid (mainly carp) annual
production is approximately 17 million tons, of which more than 12 million
tons produced in China. The KHV situation in this huge subcontinent is not
known; we repeat previous requests for any available information on
relevant KHV monitoring activities there.
