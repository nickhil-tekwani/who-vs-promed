Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) has identified root-knot nematode in citrus plants for the 1st time in Tamil Nadu. A farmer had brought a wilted citrus sapling. TNAU's K Poornima said, "We found that the sapling was infected with root-knot nematodes. In the past few months, we found root-knot in citrus saplings in Coimbatore and Erode districts."

"There are also instances where there have been heavy losses in guava," said TNAU's S Subramanian [ProMED-mail post 20180305.5665346]. "Over the past 4 to 5 years, several new varieties of guava were introduced in the state. They have been affected by nematodes and [this] has caused severe losses." The annual loss in fruit crops due to nematodes was pegged at 13 per cent, he said.

The department has been researching how to tackle the nematodes. Beneficial fungi known to inhibit nematode growth have been produced [for] farmers. Workshops for farmers and nursery owners [have been conducted].

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in many types of soil. Symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis; large galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and even killing the host. Affected plants may show increased sensitivity to other bacterial or fungal pathogens.

The nematodes can persist in the soil for many years and are spread by plant material, soil and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides and use of resistant crop varieties.

_M. enterolobii_ was identified in 2016 as the cause of a guava wilt in Tamil Nadu (see ProMED-mail post 20180305.5665346). This species is considered an emerging and particularly aggressive pathogen with increased virulence against crop varieties resistant to other root knot nematodes and may also be causing the problems in citrus reported above.
