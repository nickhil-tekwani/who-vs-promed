Damage of Pancreatic Cells by Enterovirus, A Danger in the Making
Can enterovirus cause juvenile diabetes mellitus? The Deputy Director of
the Institute of Preventive Medicine, Wang Lip Sin is of the opinion that
designated doctors should, from the point of view of preventive medicine,
follow-up childhood patients to look for possible sequelae. Parents should
be on the look out for symptoms of polyuria, polyphagia and polydipsia as
well as seek early medical attention when they occur.
A practicing pediatrician in Dayea, Dr. Chen Chung Sean said that virus
epidemic and juvenile diabetes had had a close relationship. Poland for
example, after an epidemic of enterovirus in 1982, experienced an increase
of enterovirus meningitis from previous incidence of 3 to 5 cases [? Per
year to 88 cases. The following 5 years, saw a jump of juvenile diabetes,
from previous prevalence of 3.5 per 100,000 to 6.6 per 100,000. This was
closely related to the enterovirus infection. The same study also
discovered that those under 4 years old were more affected by enterovirus
meningitis while children between 10 and 14 years were more likely to
present with juvenile diabetes.
He further pointed out reports from Finland, USA and Japan had also shown
that after enterovirus infections there would an increase in rates of
damage to other cells [sic. This could give rise to juvenile diabetes
which had latent periods of as long as ten years. Applying the association
risks from these foreign reports to Taiwan, the current wave of enterovirus
infection could possibly add another 100 cases of new diabetes mellitus or
latent diabetes to the prevalent total number of 500 cases of juvenile
diabetes.
Dr. Chen Chung Sean raised the example of a 3-year old girl from his
clinic, who was infected with hand-foot-and-mouth disease on 4th May. She
recovered one week later, only to succumb to diabetic ketoacidosis on 16 of
June, and had to be hospitalized in Taichung's Rung Jung Hospital. There
had been no confirmation to date of the causative relationship between
hand-foot-and-mouth disease and her diabetic condition. However, this girl
had been checked for diabetes during January and March because of other
illnesses with negative results. Within the month of June, Rung Jung
Hospital alone saw three new cases of juvenile diabetes. The relationship
of these cases with the current epidemic of enterovirus is yet to be
unraveled.

A Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease Pediatric Patient from Pescardoes Afflicted
with Juvenile Diabetes
Kaohsiung's Changkung Hospital discovered juvenile diabetes manifested by a
three-year-old girl a week ago , who was suspected of having presented with
hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The connection between the two diseases awaits
further investigations. This girl presented a week ago with tachypnea,
breathlessness and dehydration. She was transferred over the straits from
the Pescardoes Islands to Kaohsuing's Changkung Hospital for emergency
management. Doctors' findings were hyperglycemia (exceeding 500, normal
should be below 100 [no units given, presumably in mg.) and severe
acidosis. These were in addition to the reported symptoms (furnished by
family members) of polyuria, polydipsia and loss of weight. She was
diagnosed as having diabetic ketoacidosis and dehydration. Following
treatment, the ketosis and dehydration improved but the blood sugar had
remained high, requiring control with insulin and referral yesterday to
Taipeh's Majea Hospital.
The patient's private doctor, Dr. Chou, telephoned Changkung Hospital's
pediatrician, Dr. Hwang Chung Ping to reveal that the child was stricken
with hand-foot-and-mouth disease on 28th of April. He suspected the girl's
juvenile diabetes was a sequela of enterovirus infection because there had
been no family history of diabetes in the family.
