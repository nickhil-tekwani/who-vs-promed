State public health officials are investigating an outbreak in which people have become ill after being exposed to _Legionella_ bacteria.

A group of about 40 adults and young people from North Alabama might have been exposed to the bacteria in early July 2014 during a series of softball tournaments, said Dr. Mary G. McIntyre with the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH). She serves as assistant state health officer for disease control and prevention and epidemiologist for the ADPH.

The exposure likely occurred on or about 12 Jul 2014, with the Health Department receiving the 1st reports on 16 Jul 2014, she said. The group had traveled to softball tournaments in Gadsden, Millbrook and Birmingham, she said.

"We are working now to determine the common factor in the outbreak," she said. "We are conducting environmental investigations at places where the group visited or had in common. At this time, those reports have not been completed, so we do not know the source of the bacteria."

Out of the group, 16 people reported being sickened, she said. Specimens were taken, and 3 people tested positive for being exposed to the _Legionella_ bacteria.

Of those who reported symptoms, one person developed pneumonia and one or 2 people were hospitalized, she said.

The _Legionella_ bacteria grow in warm water and are most often found in large plumbing systems, decorative fountains, hot tubs and cooling towers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website. People become infected when they breathe in the bacteria, as they are carried in a mist or vapor. The bacteria can't be spread person to person, according to the CDC.

Symptoms include respiratory distress such as coughing and shortness of breath, mid- to high-level fever, nausea, gastric distress and, in advanced cases, pneumonia, according to the CDC.

_Legionella_ bacteria can cause Legionnaires' disease and Pontiac fever, a less severe sickness than Legionnaires' [disease].

Once the source for the Alabama exposure is determined, steps will be taken to remove the bacteria, McIntyre said.

When calls started coming in to the Alabama Department of Public Health from concerned parents who reported illnesses in adults and children after a local softball tournament, the state launched an investigation into the outbreak.

The group of more than 40 people was in the area the 2nd weekend in July 2014, and 14 people got sick, experiencing varying symptoms, from fever, cough and congestion to nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

In clinical tests, 3 people tested positive for _Legionella_, a bacterium found naturally in the environment, usually in water.

_Legionella_ is a bacterium that can cause a form of pneumonia called [Legionnaire's] disease. Most people are exposed to _Legionella_ regularly and usually don't get legionellosis, but people with weak immune systems are typically more susceptible to the disease.

Most people get infected by inhaling the bacteria. It can't be transferred by person to person contact. "It can be found in the water in systems like swimming pools, hot tubs, cooling towers, fountains, especially the ornamental fountains that spray water. It can even be associated with people doing stuff in their yards with hoses and sprinklers," explained Dr. Mary McIntyre, State Epidemiologist.

The state health department is still working to pinpoint exactly where the bacteria came from. Officials say the common link between the people who tested positive for _Legionella_ is a hotel in Elmore County.

While they couldn't reveal the name of the hotel at this point in their investigation, they tell 12 News that water samples from the hotel's pool, hot tub and filtration system are being tested as well as samples from the hotel's entire water system and coolant system, what McIntyre referred to as environmental samples.

"There is no definitive link because we do not have positive environmental samples yet. We do have an association with a hotel in the Elmore County area, but because there have been no positive environmental samples, there's no way to say that this is actually the cause," she told WSFA. There are no statewide requirements for specific testing when it comes to public pools, and only 8 counties in Alabama have local pool regulations.

"We know if we keep the chlorine levels at a certain level, we can keep the microorganisms down to a certain level, and the recirculation plays into that, because then you get even distribution with the sanitation with the chemicals, so it's all working together," said Mark Sestak, Alabama Department of Public Health. "Even if there is proper maintenance, issues can occur if the system is overburdened with too many people in the water," Dr. McIntyre added.

Meanwhile, the state continues its _Legionella_ investigation. State health officials say the probe could take months. The state health department has not gotten reports of any new cases tied to this outbreak.

[Out of a group of about 40 adults and children from northern Alabama who were on a tour of softball tournaments in the cities of Gadsden, Millbrook and Birmingham in the US state of Alabama, 14 or 16 adults and children (the total varies in the 2 news reports above) reported being sickened with fever, cough and congestion, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and one had pneumonia; 3 people tested positive for legionellosis, but we are not told what type of diagnostic tests were done (such as culture, urinary antigen, or serology). We are also not given the timeline over which the cases occurred, nor the age distribution of cases. The suspected source is a hotel in Elmore County, Alabama.

Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by _Legionella_, most often_Legionella pneumophila_, a Gram-negative bacillus. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis, and Pontiac fever is a less severe, non-pneumonic form. Presumably, those sickened in the Alabama outbreak without pneumonia had Pontiac fever.

Legionnaires' disease, and presumably Pontiac fever, are usually acquired by inhalation of an infectious dose of aerosolized _Legionella_. Pontiac fever develops in a very high proportion of people hours to a few days after exposure to a common source, with fever, malaise and muscle aches, whereas Legionnaires' disease has a much lower attack rate and an incubation period of 2 to 14 days after exposure (http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians.html).

While _Legionella_ can be isolated from respiratory secretions in patients with Legionnaires' disease, _Legionella_ are virtually never isolated from patients with Pontiac fever (http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/top10.htm), and tests for urinary _Legionella_ antigen, which are usually positive in patients with Legionnaires' disease caused by _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, may be negative in patients with Pontiac fever (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/229.full).

The diagnosis of Pontiac fever is usually confirmed by development of antibodies to the _Legionella_ isolated from an environmental source in a significant fraction of affected people exposed to the suspected source. Similarly, the diagnosis of Legionnaires' disease can also be confirmed by the development of antibodies to the _Legionella_ isolated from an environmental source.

Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, smokers, alcoholics, or who have an underlying illness such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. However, healthy individuals can also be at risk of contracting this disease. Legionnaires' disease is uncommon in children, and infected children have usually similar risk factors for legionellosis as have adults, such as heart or lung disease and immunosuppression.

More information concerning the clinical and epidemiological findings in this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

The city of Millbrook is located in part in Elmore County in the center of the US state of Alabama. Gadsden is about 140 miles (225 km) to the northeast and Birmingham 85 miles (137 km) to the northwest of Millbrook by car.
