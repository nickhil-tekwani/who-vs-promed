Foulbrood outbreak hits Stranraer bee hive
------------------------------------------
American Foulbrood (AFB) has been confirmed by the Scottish government
at one hive in the Stranraer area. An infected area has been declared
5km (3 miles) around the apiary involved, prohibiting the movement of
bees or equipment in or out of the area.

Foulbrood is caused by a bacterium getting inside bee larvae and using
up their food supplies, starving them to death. Hives with AFB cannot
be treated with antibiotics and have to be destroyed.

There were outbreaks of the disease and European Foulbrood (EFB) in
Perthshire last year. The Scottish government is currently working on
a control strategy for the diseases. There is no public health risk
from the outbreak.
