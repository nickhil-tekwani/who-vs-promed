SENASA [Servicio Nacional de Sanidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria;
National Service for Animal Health and Food Quality] issued
assurances that the outbreak of bovine rabies has been controlled.
The head of the Paralytic Rabies [Program] of SENASA, Gabriel Russo,
stated that the focus of this disease detected in the Collagasta
(Fray Mamerto Esquiu) area "has been controlled" through the joint
intervention of the Provincial Livestock Directorate and the national
animal health organization.

Also, actions are continuing [in the area] around this focus, he
indicated. These statements were given following verification of
sanitary [rabies prevention] work in bovine and equine livestock.

Some 80 percent of the animals have been immunized in the area where
one of the foci was detected, and work is being done in an area 12-15
km [6-10 mi] between the 2 foci. "We are doing this as a preventive
measure in the absence of a diagnosis," the specialist explained.

The livestock director, Juan Jose Bellon, also mentioned that the
Ministry of Health has been working to complement [livestock efforts]
by vaccinating pets such as dogs and cats, as a preventive measure to
avoid the possibility of human exposure.

Some days ago, the small [livestock] producers of the area had
informed authorities about signs of weakness they had observed in
some bovine animals, which resulted in the immediate intervention of
the provincial animal health authorities.

The vampire bat control efforts conducted by the governmental
authorities are as, or more, important than rabies itself because
[vampires] wreak economic havoc for small producers, said Russo. This
is due to the daily loss of blood taken by these blood-sucking bats,
which results in debilitation [of livestock] to the point where there
is irreparable damage with considerable economic losses.

According to Russo's statements, the strategy for avoidance of this
scourge is continuous intervention in caves and refuges where the bat
colonies live, and declaration of "sentinel refuge" of all those
places from which they have been evicted.

Apart from the vigorous intervention of the [animal] health
authorities, the SENASA official completely discarded that the
disease [virus] has been transmitted to humans or pets. In reality,
for many years the country has not had one of these cases, and it is
very rare, he said.

The tasks are preventive to avoid the propagation of the focus of
[animals] infected by the bats, mammals that feed on the blood of
other animals, generally during the night.

The recommendations for the rural population near the zone [of the
outbreak] consist of avoiding contact with animals, discouraging
consumption of meat from the area, and acting rapidly to vaccinate
[animals]. "We ask that the people not slaughter or medicate without
consulting immediately with the office of the director of Livestock
or with SENASA, because vaccination must be done by a veterinarian.

"Samples for reliable rabies laboratory diagnosis [to determine] if
the animals are infected must be taken when the [disease] is well
advanced or when the animal is recently dead, but it is of vital
importance that the producer inform the authorities of the
situation," Russo stated.

Among the symptoms characteristic of an animal infected by a vampire
[bat] transmitted paralytic rabies are ataxia, depression, staggering
gait, difficulty in standing, dry tongue, dehydrated fecal material,
little or no urine [production], and characteristic kicking movements.

According to the explanation of the SENASA official, rabies is a
zoonotic disease characteristic of northern Argentina and extends
from the 33rd parallel, covering all of South and Central America up
to Mexico.

[Note that "...for many years the country has not had one of these
cases [of bvampire bat rabies], and it is very rare." Perhaps forest
has been recently cleared for pasture in that region, bringing cattle
into contact with the bats, allowing the disease to emerge there. -

Controlling vampire bats by eliminating their roosts is extremely
difficult because these roosts can be hard to find. Effective vampire
bat control has been accomplished by capturing bats in mist nets when
they come to feed on livestock, and applying anticoagulant jelly
(warfarin and similar products) which they and their roost-mates
ingest on grooming, or by intraruminal [into the stomach] injection of
these compounds in cattle, achieving blood levels sufficient to kill
the bats without harm to the treated cattle.
