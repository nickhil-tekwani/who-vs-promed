-------------------------------------------------------------------
As a bat rehabilitator, this recommendation, to take a possibly injured animal and fling it high into the air and hope it doesn't crash and exacerbate any existing injury or die on impact, seems unnecessary and inhumane. I get injured bats into care on a regular basis, from people who have rescued them safely with leather gloves and a cloth, and many of these bats with wrist or elbow injuries cannot fly well if at all. Most bats also go into daily torpor, and are incapable of flying if their muscles are cold, so a bat that may have just been blown out of a tree could be grievously injured by following this "catapult" advice.

If there are no wildlife rehabilitators in the area who could take the bat into care, the finder could get leather gloves and long-sleeved shirt and put the bat up on a tree trunk, at least, to give it a chance to fly away after dark when it would be safe from predators.

[Cynthia -- thank you -- makes a fair point, which is based on experience with bats. At the same time the risks associated with possibly rabid bats need to be recognised and minimised, quite apart from generating the necessary surveillance information on the current local situation vis-a-vis rabid bats. What I have done is to carefully place a bat with obvious flying problems in an open cardboard box and place that up in a tree branch or fork so it can clamber out and fly away, or the body recovered if it cannot. In the latter situation it is submitted to the necessary agency for rehabilitation or rabies diagnosis. - Mod.MHJ
