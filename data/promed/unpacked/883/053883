re: Brucellosis - Israel: camel milk, multiple contaminants, recalls, RFI 20160814.4414452
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Referring to item "[1] Brucella in unpasteurized camel milk," the following questions arise:

1. Has brucellosis been confirmed in the (3) hospitalized children "associated with the consumption of the said product?"
2. Has action been undertaken to discover the origin of the contaminated milk-producing camels?
3. In case detected, what measures have been/will be applied in relation to the infected animals/flock?

It deserves to be added that according to the most recent weekly epidemiological report of the Ministry of Health (week No. 30, 2016), 36 new cases in humans have been reported during the 30th week alone, 30 of which are in the Beer Sheva district, the district in which the entirety of Israel's camel population is located. The cumulative number of human brucellosis cases since the start of 2016 is given as 303, compared to 290 during the same period in 2015.

[An informed response to the above queries would be appreciated.

The only _Brucella_ species currently circulating in Israel is _Brucella melitensis_. _B. abortus_ was eradicated decades back. Recently, goats kept in a petting zoo, similarly in the Beer-Sheva district, were found to be infected and had to be culled.

The State Veterinary Services have launched a 5 year control plan (2014-2019) within the said district, which was planned to include subsidised mass vaccination with REV1 vaccine and animal identification.
