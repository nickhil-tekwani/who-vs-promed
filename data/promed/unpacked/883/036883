[1] FMD Surrey: 7th outbreak confirmed

Positive test results for Foot and Mouth disease (FMD) have now been
confirmed at the site where it was decided that cattle should be
slaughtered on suspicion earlier today [24 Sep 2007]. The site is
within the existing Egham Protection Zone in Surrey, and this becomes
the 7th Infected Premises since 3 Aug 2007.
Minor changes are being made to the Protection Zone (PZ) and
Surveillance Zone (SZ) in the area.
It remains essential for animal keepers to practice the highest
standards of biosecurity, remain vigilant for disease and report any
suspicions immediately. Livestock owners should examine their
livestock twice a day.

[According to the BBC citing Defra, this herd was killed at a farm in
Englefield Green near Egham. It is becoming the 5th outbreak since
the start of the 2nd FMD "wave" (which was actually a continuation of
the initial outbreak), within the Egham area. - Mod.AS]

[2] FMD Hampshire: 1st suspicion refuted; 2nd suspected outbreak

Another suspected new case of FMD is being investigated at a farm in
Hampshire, the National Farmers' Union has said.
Officials have said a suspected new case of FMD on the Hampshire-West
Sussex border was a false alarm [It will be helpful to note if
bluetongue has been excluded in the said case. - Mod.AS].
The latest suspected case is in the West Tytherly area, near
Stockbridge. [For the official declaration of a temporary control
zone with map, see
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/fmd/pdf/declaration-tcz240907.pdf>.
- Mod.AS]
Farmers have called for aid packages for those worst affected by the
crisis. National Farmers' Union (NFU) president Peter Kendall has
warned that farmers are facing "financial Armageddon" as a result of
the crisis.
Some 1800 animals have so far been slaughtered, but some of the
movement restrictions outside the current surveillance zone have been lifted.
An earlier outbreak in August 2007, which affected 2 premises, was
blamed on the virus escaping from leaking pipes at the nearby
Pirbright laboratory site.
Government chief vet Debby Reynolds said farmers should remain
vigilant for both the bluetongue and the foot-and-mouth virus.

[3] FMD/BT Defra's updated strategy
Date: Mon 24 Sep 2007

<http://www.defra.gov.uk/news/2007/070924a.htm>

Chief Veterinary Officer, Debby Reynolds, today [24 Sep 2007]
outlined the integrated risk based approach to deal with the current
disease situation with both Bluetongue and Foot and Mouth Disease,
based on the contingency plan and continued work with industry.
In the current foot and mouth outbreak, there have been 6 Infected
Premises. There is one Temporary Control Zone on the Hampshire/West
Sussex border, and in addition, a further Temporary Control Zone has
today [24 Sep 2007] been established at a premises in Hampshire. A
further slaughter on suspicion for Foot and Mouth disease is taking
place at a premises within the existing Egham Protection Zone.
Defra has also today [24 Sep 2007] published the latest FMD
Epidemiology report produced by the National Epidemiology Emergency
Group. It concludes that IP5 provides a link between the August and
September 2007 cases with IP5 probably being infected by mechanical
transmission, either from the Pirbright site or one of the 1st 2
Infected Premises in the Elstead area. It also concludes that IPs 3
and 4 were probably infected subsequently.
The report also states there have been limited animal movements out
of the Surrey area, in part due to the restrictions in place in
August 2007, which have reduced the risk of wider spread. In
addition, the report concludes that the future course of the outbreak
is dependent on the surveillance for infection and disease by both
animal keepers and Animal Health patrols. Cattle owners should check
their animals twice daily and report any suspicions of disease immediately.
Intensive surveillance is already underway on a precautionary basis
in the wider Egham and Surrey areas. Further surveillance by cattle
blood testing will take place.
Based on the epidemiological report and the overall assessment of
risk, 2 FMD risk areas will come into effect from 3.30 pm tomorrow
[Tue 25 Sep 2007]:
Risk Area: consisting of Essex, Kent, East and West Sussex,
Hampshire, Surrey, Berkshire, Hertfordshire, Oxfordshire,
Buckinghamshire and Greater London.
Low Risk Area: The rest of England, Wales and Scotland. In England,
farm to farm movements will be allowed also from 3.30 pm Tue 25 Sep
2007 under stringent conditions and subject to high levels of
biosecurity with enforcement by Local Authorities.
Defra has also identified, from 3.30 pm Tue 25 Sep 2007, a Bluetongue
Temporary Area while surveillance is carried out to determine whether
the virus is circulating. This area encompasses Lincolnshire,
Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire and covers those additional areas
which could be included in any further movement controls should an
outbreak of Bluetongue be confirmed.
Debby Reynolds, Chief Veterinary Officer, said: "All these areas will
be kept under active review, and we will continue with a risk-based,
staged approach. The aim is to reduce the size of the FMD risk area
as work progresses. In the next 24 hours, everyone needs to prepare
for their own role in ensuring this important next step is
successful. We recognise the real economic and welfare pressures
being experienced by farmers. The risk of animal movements is
evaluated on a daily basis, and we have a clear commitment to allow
movements, including to livestock markets, as soon as the situation allows."
Notes to editors
1. FMD Risk Area [11 counties; see map indicated in commentary]:
Existing FMD controls continue to apply in this area.
The following livestock movements out of this area will be permitted:
- Direct moves to slaughter (both within and outside the risk area);
- Direct moves to slaughter via collection centres and dedicated
slaughter sales (both within and outside the risk area);
The following moves will be permitted within this area, but livestock
may not be moved out of this area into the low risk area: - Calving
cows (up to 50 km with a 20 day standstill); - Pigs moving within
established "pyramids" between specific units (up to 50 km or 100 km).
2. FMD Low Risk Area [The entire territory of the UK outside the
above mentioned FMD Risk Area; see map indicated in commentary]:
Existing FMD movements continue to apply. In addition, farm to farm
movements will be permitted under strict conditions and subject to
high levels of biosecurity.
3. Bluetongue Temporary Area [8 counties; see map indicated in
commentary]: The same movements as in the FMD Risk Zone will apply,
but in addition, farm to farm movements will be permitted under
strict conditions and subject to high levels of biosecurity. Cattle
and sheep will not be permitted to move out of the Bluetongue
Temporary Area, but pig movements within established pyramids will be
permitted to move, subject to license conditions.

Today [24 Sep 2007], the United Kingdom's Department For Environment,
Food And Rural Affairs [DEFRA] published the latest FMD epidemiology
report produced by the National Epidemiology Emergency Group. It
concludes that infected premises (IP) 5 provides a link between the
August and September 2007 cases with it probably being infected by
mechanical transmission, either from the Pirbright site or one of the
1st 2 Infected Premises in the Elstead area. It also concludes that
IPs 3 and 4 were probably infected subsequently.
The report also states there have been limited animal movements out

Based on the epidemiological report and the overall assessment of
risk, 2 FMD risk areas will come into effect from 3.30 pm Tue 25 Sep
2007 [See item 3 "Defra's updated strategy" above].
