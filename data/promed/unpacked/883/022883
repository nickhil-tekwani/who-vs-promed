So... who in this rural area is dealing with testing and reporting? How
were the animals captured and tested? Who does the testing? Using what
methods? What type of post exposure prophylaxis regimen was used with the
human exposures? Which agency evaluated the risks inherent with each
exposure? I am asking these questions because there doesn't seem to be a
standard nationwide protocol in use. I have referred several possible
exposures to county health here in Oregon, USA, and have not been impressed
with the knowledge or evaluation of risk for the patients I have referred.
Any info you could provide would be of help.

Willacy County has a local rabies control authority/animal control officer
who is responsible for investigating animal bites and possible rabies
exposures. In this particular county, the suspected rabid animals are
taken to either of 2 local veterinarians for euthanasia and head removal.
The animal specimens are shipped by bus to the Texas Department of
Health's (TDH) Rabies Laboratory in Austin for testing by direct
immunofluorescence. Positive specimens are also tested by monoclonal
antibody and PCR techniques to determine the rabies virus strain.
When an animal tests positive for rabies in Texas, the incident is
investigated by the Zoonosis Control Division of the Texas Department of
Health in collaboration with local animal control and health department
authorities. Human and animal exposures are evaluated using TDH guidelines
(Rabies Prevention in Texas - 1997, available at the Zoonosis website:
www.tdh.state.tx.us/zoonosis/), which follow the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) "Human Rabies Prevention - United States
1999" guidelines published by Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
. In Texas, we follow the standard rabies
postexposure treatment regimen: Human Rabies Immuno Globulin (HRIG) plus
tissue culture vaccine on day 0, and additional vaccine doses on day 3, 7,
14, and 28.

Sounds like it might be a good idea for the local veterinary association to
consider sponsoring a low cost rabies vaccination clinic, even a mobile
vaccination clinic in a van, etc. to get more of these dogs and cats
covered. We've done several here in Pennsylvania and the turnout is
excellent. Vets, and technicians volunteer their time; owners pay cost
only. Local papers are informed and their stories serve to advertise the
clinics. TV/radio can be involved too, as a public service. Owners know
they should be getting these vaccinations but for financial or whatever
reasons often don't. Making it an "event" seems to motivate them better.
