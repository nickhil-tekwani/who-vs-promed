Health officials have confirmed Montana's 1st hantavirus case of the year [2013]. Montana typically sees one or 2 cases of hantavirus every year.

"Any particular population of deer mice will have some portion of that population probably infected with [a] hantavirus because they're a host," says Gallatin City-County Health Department Environmental Health Director Tim Roark.

Roark says that it is important to take precautions to keep hantavirus carriers out of your home. "Make sure it's clean, there's no food source, no water, and they can't get in," says Roark.

As folks are gearing up for spring cleaning, clearing out barns or out-buildings, Roark says it's crucial to look for signs of rodents, like droppings or nests.

"The most important thing for people to remember is do not sweep those up. Hantavirus is generally received when it's attached to dust and kicked up," explains Roark. Instead of sweeping up nests or droppings, health experts recommend you use gloves and to soak whatever you find in disinfectant or a bleach solution for 5 minutes before throwing it out in a plastic bag.

A Gallatin Valley local who owns a family farm north of town said that "in the past, we've had barn cats and house cats that take care of the mice on the farm. I think it's less of a problem because we don't store any grain or anything, so there's not a good food supply," says Rugheimer. Although he's not concerned about the virus, Rugheimer does say that he takes the proper precautions when he finds signs of rodents on his property.

The person who contracted the hantavirus in Deer Lodge county is expected to make a full recovery. It's one of 36 cases in Montana since 1993, when the virus was discovered.

[Although the specific hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, it is most likely Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_, which is widely distributed in North America and frequently invades houses, especially during cold, winter weather. In addition to Sin Nombre virus, rodents are the principal hosts of 4 other hantaviruses known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in North America.
