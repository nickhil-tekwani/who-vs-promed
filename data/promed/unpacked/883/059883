[1] Somoa: State of Emergency

Samoa has closed all schools and cracked down on public gatherings as it enters a state of emergency over the deadly measles outbreak spreading across the Pacific islands.

The island state of just 200 000, halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, announced the state of emergency on [Sat 16 Nov 2019] after declaring a measles epidemic late in October 2019, when the 1st deaths were reported.

Since then, at least 6 deaths, mostly infants under the age of 2, have been linked to the outbreak, the health ministry said in a statement late last week. Of the 716 suspected cases of measles, 40% required hospitalisation. As of the weekend, it would be a "mandatory legal requirement" for unvaccinated citizens to receive an immunisation injection, the government said in a statement. Only about 2-thirds of the population has been immunised, according to the health ministry.

In the statement, Samoa's director general of health, Leausa Take Naseri, said: "The way it is going now and the poor (immunisation) coverage, we are anticipating the worst to come."

He added that the children who have died had not been vaccinated.

New Zealand's foreign minister, Winston Peters, said on [Fri 15 Nov 2019] that his country would send 3000 vaccines and 12 nurses to Samoa to assist with the outbreak. "Measles is highly contagious, and the outbreak has taken lives in Samoa," Peters said. "It is in everybody's interests that we work together to stop its spread."

Measles cases are rising globally, including in wealthy nations such as the US and Germany, where some parents shun immunisation mostly for philosophical or religious reasons, or concerns, debunked by medical science, that such vaccines could cause autism.

In Tonga, about 900km [approx. 560 mi] from Samoa, the ministry of health last week said an outbreak of measles in the country occurred following the return of a squad of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand. Since then, 251 cases of confirmed or suspected measles have been identified, the ministry said.

American Samoa, a US territory neighbouring Samoa, declared a public health emergency on [Thu 14 Nov 2019] following the measles outbreak in Samoa and Tonga, according to New Zealand media.

According to Naseri, about 90% of the population in Tonga and American Samoa have been immunised, and neither of these countries have reported any measles-related deaths.

[2] Tonga: SitRep Number 5

1. Summary of Situation
Background
An outbreak of measles in Tonga occurred following the return of a squad of Tongan rugby players from New Zealand where one player had developed the illness. A further 12 players developed measles on their return to Tonga. Samples from 6 of these cases were laboratory confirmed as measles. The outbreak has involved mainly teenagers from schools on Tongatapu as well as students from Vava'u High School. Cases are epidemiologically linked to the initial imported cases. The Ministry of Health Epidemic Task Force has been convened which is comprised of public health physicians and staff, clinicians, pharmacy and laboratory representatives to advice on the management of the outbreak.
Note: Refer to earlier SitReps for further detail of the initial cases and response.

2. Current Situation
As of the [12 Nov 2019], 251 cases of confirmed or suspected measles have been identified in Tonga of which 86% are in the island of Tongatapu and 14% in Vava'u. There have been 4 admissions since the beginning of the outbreak and all have been discharged home with no complications. No deaths have been reported. The attached charts [see URL] outline the results of analysis of current case information. The epidemic curve reflects a propagated outbreak matching the incubation period for measles (Figure 1). Figure 1 demonstrates the cases in Vava'u (in red) stemming from measles in 2 of the returned rugby players. Figure 2 demonstrates that while males predominate, consistent with the transmission of disease through the boys' schools, females have contracted measles as the outbreak has gone on and their numbers are increasing.

A total of 11 cases have been reported in infants less than 12 month of age, 6 cases in children 1 to 4 years of age and 9 cases in children 5 to 9 years of age (Figure 3). Predominate symptoms include rash (98% of cases) and fever (82% of cases) (Figure 4). Cases in females have occurred mainly in the 15 to 19 age group followed by the 20 to 24 (Figure 5) whereas in males, it is predominantly 15 to 19 followed by 10 to 14 years of age. Although identifying vaccination history for cases has proven challenging, some progress has been made in the number of records verified as compared to the last SitRep . Of 251 cases, vaccination history has been found for 125 cases (Figure 6). Of these 125 cases, 102 (82%) have a 2-dose history with MR vaccine and the remainder have a one dose history. The remaining cases are awaiting verification of vaccination histories. There is currently no evidence to suggest that new lines of transmission have occurred.

Key events/ issues since last SitRep
- There is increasing number of cases seen outside the predominant age group (10 to 19) and risk category e.g. children, infants.
- A total of 12 cases have been reported from Vava'u, all in the 15 to 19 year age group and linked through the school. This is a co-educational high school and 3 of the cases are in girls.
-The consumables requested through MFAT to support the measles outbreak have arrived in Tonga and was received at the MOH Central Medical Store on the [11 Nov 2019].
-A supply of Capon swabs for sampling arrived from WHO DPS on the [11 Nov 2019].
- Results from samples of 18 people suspected of having measles that were sent to VIDRL on [29 Oct 2019] are still pending.
- A further 2500 doses of MR vaccine has been requested from UNICEF.
- The 6 players of the Tonga futsal team that were quarantined with suspected measles in New Caledonia has been confirmed PCR positive by New Caledonia officials and genotype results is pending. These players are well and have returned to Tonga on the [12 Nov 2019] and are being followed up by the Public Health team.

Actions Taken:
- On Tongatapu and Vava'u, Doctors, Health Officers and District Health Nurses are continuing to follow-up cases and contacts at home and complete details on case investigation forms and gather vaccination history.
- The MOH is collaborating with UNICEF, WHO and DFAT in the drafting, printing and releasing of risk communication materials.
- Mass media programs as well as awareness programs in villages and districts are on-going.
- The national external examinations for forms 5-7 commenced on the [5 Nov 2019] and are currently underway. A mixture of students from different high schools in Tongatapu and Vava'u sit their exams in designated examination venues. The Ministry of Health collaborated with the Ministry of Education in identifying a separate examination venue for students with measles. Public Health staff were on site at each of the examination venues to provide support and to identify potential new cases. Exam supervisors were vaccinated for measles and health talks to student and teachers were carried out at all venues.
- A total of 2304 doses (1864 in Tongatapu and 440 in Vava'u) of MR vaccine have been used in response to the outbreak including post exposure prophylaxis, vaccination of HCW and vaccination of travellers including seasonal workers, sports teams and others.
- Given the current available stock of vaccine, vaccination for travellers is prioritized to the following people; those aged 10 to 24 years of age regardless of vaccination history, infants between 6 and 11 months of age, and children not up to date with vaccinations or where parents are not sure.
- A further 2500 doses of MR vaccine was ordered from UNICEF.
- Mr. Tony Kolbe (WHO consultant) who assisted in the measles response completed his time in Tonga and a request was made to WHO for further technical assistance. We would like to acknowledge Tony for his help and support.

Actions to be completed:
- Further actions to ensure that travellers and touring sporting teams/ groups as well as seasonal workers are vaccinated for measles as necessary before departure.
- The feasibility of a SIA for those aged 10 to 24 in Tonga to be discussed by the Epidemic Taskforce and with the Ministry of Education given that the majority of this age group will be in high school.
- Review of vaccine stocks and procure further stock given increased demand for vaccination.
- To continue with verification of measles immunisation records for cases and their contacts.
- Further discussions with the Ministry of Education on ways to minimise mixing of students and further transmission of measles given that it is the time of the year for prize giving and graduation ceremonies in both 1ary and 2ary schools.
- Weekly meeting of Epidemic taskforce to continue.
- Continue with surveillance activities.

Next SitRep due to be issued 20 Nov 2019

The Georgia Department of Public Health says there are 3 additional cases of measles in Cobb County.

This comes after a reported case earlier this month. State health officials said a student came down with measles and was present at Mabry Middle School on [31 Oct and 1 Nov 2019].

In this latest case, at least 2 of the people with measles were unvaccinated, and the vaccination history of the 3rd was unclear. A 4th person was tested but the results came back negative. These individuals may have exposed other people to measles between 30 Oct and 13 Nov 2019.

Officials are notifying people who may have been exposed to the virus and may be at increased risk for developing measles. It is highly likely these cases in Cobb County are all related, but the investigation into any linkage is ongoing at this time.

"My kids are vaccinated, so I'm not too concerned. I would be concerned for those that aren't able to be vaccinated," said parent Melissa Whitehouse.

So far this year, there are 11 confirmed cases of measles in Georgia - more cases than in the previous decade combined.

"These additional cases of measles should be highly concerning for anyone who is not vaccinated with MMR. Measles is a serious disease, one which can lead to dangerous complications, even death," said Kathleen E. Toomey, M.D., M.P.H. "The MMR vaccine is safe and about 97% effective in preventing measles. Vaccination is strongly advised for individuals not only to protect themselves, but to protect vulnerable populations - such as infants who are too young to be vaccinated and those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons."
