Comment: Rabies - India (10): (TN) canine, human 20131230.2143331
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The death of patients from rabies in Tamil Nadu, India, is another tragedy that could have been prevented by early post-exposure prophylaxis. The total number of such cases in India is unknown but likely in the thousands. The number of worldwide human rabies quoted by WHO is around 55 000 every year, but widely considered under reported. Most of these human deaths occur in smaller communities and remote areas where post-exposure prophylactic treatment is simply not available at all and not likely to be available soon. Victims do not have the means to travel to a distant treatment center. During the last few years, there has been an increase in hope that rabies might be treatable, initiated by the recovery of several patients who underwent intensive care in tertiary medical centers. Very isolated such cases have been reported in past decades and a voluminous literature dealing with this subject can be found in PubMed database. The current view among experts in this field is that they are very rare and mostly due to a vigorous natural immune response that kills the virus before it does irreparable damage. Such patients have evidence of an active antibody titre in serum and CNS fluid on admission, or very soon thereafter, and had expert intensive life support treatment as well. Nevertheless, further work, dealing with active therapy for rabies, is most desirable and must be supported. To do this, there are ample small animal models that have been explored by experienced virologists and immunologists in years past. This is where Anitha Sironman needs to start. I note that she has published 2 peer review papers not dealing with rabies viruses or indeed infection. There may, however, be something in the "not indexed" Indian literature; if yes, it needs to be expanded and published. She will find that it will be much easier for her to convince skeptical ethics committee members to allow human efforts when some of her experimental work appears in print. In the meantime, it is imperative for all of us seeing human rabies patients, to try and provide good ICU care (not banishment to a rabies cell) for such unfortunates who might well be a very rare, true, natural recovery case if properly supported. Rabies is not a highly transmittable disease like flu or measles. Normal preventive hospital measures will render a rabies patient safe if cared for in a fully equipped and staffed ICU where experimental therapies can be carried out.
