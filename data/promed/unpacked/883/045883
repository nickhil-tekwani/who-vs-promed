Avian botulism killed 400 ducks at a wetlands reserve in Boise. Avian
botulism is a naturally-occurring bacteria which can sometimes turn deadly
for waterfowl. Experts believe this happened for 2 months to the ducks
roosting at night in the 44-acre open space. They say the bacteria was a
slow killer. It altered the ducks ability to fly and they eventually
starved to death in the wetlands where there was not enough food to sustain
them.

[The bacterium (_Clostridium botulinum_) probably responsible for this
outbreak produces a toxin that when ingested causes avian botulism, type C.
The bacterium is commonly found in soils and mud along lakes and rivers.
When water levels drop, temperatures rise, and oxygen is no longer present,
the bacteria reproduce, generating a toxin. Waterfowl and shorebirds are
affected when they ingest toxin while feeding in these areas. The disease
can spread quickly when healthy birds feed on maggots on infected
carcasses, prompting the extensive efforts to remove dead birds. It is not
always fatal to the birds. Birds die when they lose control of muscles
enabling them to fly, breathe, and they can drown when they can no longer
hold up their heads. Type C or avian botulism is rarely a threat to
humans, who are more often affected by type A, B or E, sometimes found in
improperly canned food. - Mod.TG
