Gene Chip Technology Finds Likely Cause of SARS
-----------------------------------------------
SAN FRANCISCO: It took just a few waves of the computer mouse for Joseph
DeRisi to identify the prime suspect behind the sometimes deadly new
mystery illness dubbed severe acute respiratory syndrome. Using a laser
microscope to compare victim samples sent by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention to genetic material from about 1000 different
viruses imprinted on a glass slide, the University of California researcher
found the telltale clues of the suspect virus appearing as illuminated dots
on his computer screen.
DeRisi placed his computer's cursor over one lighted dot and it read
"bovine coronavirus." Another dot outputted "avian coronavirus." By the
time he got to the turkey and human coronavirus dots, he knew he was
dealing with something the world's scientists had never seen before. If it
had been a known virus --- say the human coronavirus, a cause of the common
cold --- then only human coronavirus dots would have lighted up. "This
suggests this is not a simple mutation of a human virus," said DeRisi.
Whatever this was, it was related closely enough to the other viruses to
bond to their DNA [cDNA in the case of RNA viruses?] but exotic enough to
suggest that it was something entirely new that had crossed the species
barrier. DeRisi immediately e-mailed CDC researchers on 23 Mar 2003
confirming that a new coronavirus was probably causing the syndrome, which
has killed at least 82 people and sickened hundreds, hurting business and
travel as it spread from China, where it apparently originated.
The "virus chip" DeRisi and his colleagues created could come in handy as
epidemiologists try to identify and contain emerging diseases --- including
pathogens that bioterrorists could launch. "It's amazingly simple and
straightforward," DeRisi said. "There's nothing revolutionary about this
concept except for the fact that we did it." What DeRisi did was build upon
the microarray, or gene chip, an 8-year-old invention that melds DNA onto
glass using some of the same technology that makes computer chips.
Microarrays allow biologists to analyze thousands of genes simultaneously
instead of one at a time. "Microarrays are pretty universal," said Henry
Niman, a cancer researcher at Harvard Medical School, who uses chips with
human genes in his own research and called DeRisi's for his results on the
SARS finding. "Impressive," Niman concluded after analyzing the data.

Abstract of Paper Entitled: A Novel Coronavirus Associated with Severe
Acute Respiratory Syndrome
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:
A worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has been
associated with exposures originating from a single ill health care worker
from Guangdong Province, China. We conducted studies to identify the
etiologic agent of this outbreak.
Methods:
We received clinical specimens from patients in six countries and tested
them, using virus isolation techniques, electron-microscopical and
histologic studies, and molecular and serologic assays, in an attempt to
identify a wide range of potential pathogens.
Results:
No classic respiratory or bacterial respiratory pathogen was consistently
identified. However, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patients who met
the case definition of SARS. Cytopathological features were noted
microscopically in Vero E6 cells inoculated with a throat-swab specimen.
Electron-microscopical examination of cultures revealed ultrastructural
features characteristic of coronaviruses. Immunohistochemical and
immunofluorescence staining revealed reactivity with group I coronavirus
polyclonal antibodies. Consensus coronavirus primers designed to amplify a
fragment of the polymerase gene by reverse transcription­polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) were used to obtain a sequence that clearly identified
the isolate as a unique coronavirus only distantly related to previously
sequenced coronaviruses. With specific diagnostic RT-PCR primers we
identified several identical nucleotide sequences in 12 patients from
several locations, a finding consistent with a point source outbreak.
Indirect fluorescent antibody tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
made with the new coronavirus isolate have been used to demonstrate a
virus-specific serologic response. Preliminary studies suggest that this
virus may never before have infected the U.S. population.
Conclusion:
A novel coronavirus is associated with this outbreak, and the evidence
indicates that this virus has an etiologic role in SARS. The name Urbani
SARS-associated coronavirus is proposed for the virus.

[The text of this paper is supplemented by a comprehensive account of the
experimental techniques employed: propagation in cell culture,
immunological techniques, molecular methods and information on PCR primers.
A phylogenetic tree based on sequence alignment of 405 nucleotides of the
coronavirus polymerase gene open reading frame 1b provides strong evidence
that the SARS-associated coronavirus is genetically distinct from
previously known animal and human coronaviruses. The 18 patients with SARS
examined in this study were epidemiologically linked either to the source
of the Hong Kong cases or to Guangdong Province, China, the origin of the
index patient in Hong Kong. The sequences from a limited region of the
polymerase gene are identical to each other and to a sequence obtained from
one of the Canadian patients, and from the Fankfurt-am-Main index case
described in the following paper, all of which suggests a point source for
the SARS outbreak.
An apparent lack of antibody in all serum specimens except those from
patients with SARS suggests that this virus has not previously circulated
widely in humans, which is further evidence in favor of the association
between infection with this novel coronavirus and SARS.
Because of the death of Dr. Carlo Urbani during the investigation of the
initial SARS epidemic, the authors propose that the virus be named Urbani
SARS-associated coronavirus. However, this proposal is unlikely to be
sustained because the "Rules for Naming Viral Taxa" used by the
International Committee on Virus Taxonomy state that: "No person's name
shall be used when devising names for new taxa."
The isolation of this novel coronavirus from the respiratory secretions of
a patient with SARS and subsequent demonstration of this virus or a
serologic response to this virus in others is strong support for a possible
etiologic association between this virus and SARS. - Mod.CP]

Abstract of Paper entitled: Identification of a Novel Coronavirus in
Patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Background:
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has recently been identified
as a new clinical entity. SARS is thought to be caused by an unknown
infectious agent.
Methods:
Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were searched for unknown
viruses with the use of cell cultures and molecular techniques.
Results:
A novel coronavirus was identified in patients with SARS. The virus was
isolated in cell culture, and a sequence 300 nucleotides in length was
obtained by a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR)­based random-amplification
procedure. Genetic characterization indicated that the virus is only
distantly related to known coronaviruses (identical in 50 to 60 percent of
the nucleotide sequence). On the basis of the obtained sequence,
conventional and real-time PCR assays for specific and sensitive detection
of the novel virus were established. Virus was detected in a variety of
clinical specimens from patients with SARS but not in controls. High
concentrations of viral RNA of up to 100 million molecules per milliliter
were found in sputum. Viral RNA was also detected at extremely low
concentrations in plasma during the acute phase and in feces during the
late convalescent phase. Infected patients showed sero-conversion on the
Vero cells in which the virus was isolated.
Conclusion:
The novel coronavirus might have a role in causing SARS.

[This companion paper from European workers describes an independent set of
data that support the same conclusion that a novel coronavirus may be the
etiologic agent of SARS. Again the methodology is described in detail and
the paper is supplemented by sequence alignments and a diagrammatic
representation of the location of the primers. An independently derived
phylogenetic tree exhibits the same relationships among coronaviruses and
indicates that the SARS-associated coronavirus is not closely related to
any perviously known coronavirus. Whether it is a unique virus or a
recombinant between pre-exising viruses is an open question that must await
complete sequencing of the virus genome.
The principal finding of the study is the identification of a novel
coronavirus in patients with SARS. Furthermore, it appears that patients
with SARS are acutely infected with this virus, since they have
virus-specific IgG, and sero-conversion was observed. A high rate of
positivity among patients with probable SARS during an outbreak in Hanoi,
in conjunction with the complete negativity among all healthy contacts of
patients affected by the same outbreak, provides evidence of an association
between the disease and the presence of this novel virus.
The authors caution, however, that in the past, viruses have been initially
isolated from patients with a specific disease but subsequent
investigations revealed no actual association. Thus, larger studies with
appropriate control groups are needed to verify or eliminate the hypothesis
that this novel coronavirus is the cause of SARS. The assays that have been
established provide an excellent tool for such studies.
From a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and
throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials
contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape
detection if only these materials are tested.
By testing for a broad range of known pathogens, the authors also obtained
evidence for infection with paramyxoviruses and _Chlamidia pneumoniae_ in
some patients, but human metapneumovirus, which was previously implicated
in SARS, could be largely ruled out. Hence, it remains unclear whether
these pathogens have a role as causative factors or cofactors in SARS. -
