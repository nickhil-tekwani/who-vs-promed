The [Paraguay] Minister of Health, Oscar Martinez Doldan, confirmed
last night [21 Feb 2008] that yellow fever (YF) virus was detected by
virus isolation in blood samples from 2 ill people from the Laurelty
de San Lorenzo neighborhood. [The blood samples came from] a youth
who died last Sunday [17 Feb 2008] in the Institute for Tropical
Medicine and a woman who is now in good condition. Based on
epidemiological connections, that is proximity, and the same symptoms
2 other deaths, were confirmed as deaths from this disease. However,
it has still not been possible to determine how the disease came to
this area, according to comments by Martinez Doldan.

There have been a total of 12 confirmed [YF] cases in the country and
7 in the department [state of province equivalent. - Mod.TY] of San
Pedro. Also, Dr. Gualberto Pinanez, director of Epidemiological
Surveillance, said that there were another 5 suspected cases of the
disease in other areas of the country, such as Asuncion [capital of
Paraguay. - Mod.TY] and Caazapa [a department SE of Asuncion. -
Mod.TY]. He noted that among these, one death from Asuncion is under
investigation, although he could not specify from which area of the
capital that person resided, nor when that person died.

More vaccines arrive. At approximately 19:20 hrs yesterday [21 Feb
2008] 50 000 doses of [YF] vaccine arrived in the country as a loan
from Bolivia. The vaccines permit the continuation of immunization
this weekend, since as of noon yesterday [21 Feb 2008] the [Ministry
of] Health (MOH) had only 90 000 doses on hand.

Also, [the MOH] is awaiting the arrival of 1 500 000 doses of
vaccine, as part of a lot of 2 million doses, which the World Health
Organization Fund for Global Emergencies will send. These vaccines
will cost Paraguay approximately 3 million USD. These biologics,
produced by the French laboratory Sanofi-Pasteur, will be shipped
from Brussels and arrive in the country via charter flight

The President of Paraguay, Nicanor Duarte Frutos, indicated that he
is holding conversations with the President of Colombia, Alvaro
Uribe, to see if that country can loan vaccine.

Dr. Antonio Arbo, coordinator of the campaign to fight YF, provided
information about the vaccination [campaign] strategy for [use of]
these doses. He indicated that the intention was to assure virtually
100 percent [coverage] of the population in the area of Laurelty, San
Lorenzo [San Lorenzo is the most populous city in the Central
Department, and is located 10 km (6.2 miles) from Asuncion. -
Mod.TY]. He also indicated that they would also continue vaccination
efforts in the populations of Asuncion and the Central department.

He indicated that starting next week [week of 24 Feb 2008] they will
sum up number of vaccine [doses] administered in the Institute for
Social Services' hospitals and other private health facilities, which
have been administered without charge.

Arbo also noted as well that there is a reserve of 300 000 doses to
establish barriers in case new foci of YF appear. He also announced
the opening of a telephone number, the "yellow line," where citizens
can inquire about indications and counter-indications about the YF
vaccine and can report situations which imply adverse vaccine reactions.

[The Paraguay Ministry of Health is well into its aggressive
vaccination campaign, and has a contingency plan should cases spring
up in new areas. ProMED would be interested in knowing the details of
the nation-wide YF surveillance efforts that would be essential in
detecting new foci should they arise.
