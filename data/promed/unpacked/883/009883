This year [2008], 32 100 people have applied for medical treatment
for tick bite as of 25 Jul 2008 in Kemerovo Oblast. This is 18.5
percent more than the number of people who applied for treatment
during the same period last year. Among those, there are 6148
children, whereas by comparison last year there were 5628 children in
total. 99.4 percent of those who sought medical assistance received
appropriate emergency treatment.

758 people have been admitted to hospital on suspicion of tick-borne
encephalitis virus infection. This number is 30.7 percent greater
than last year [2007]. 67 people have been registered with a
confirmed diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis virus infection. By
comparison, during the whole course of 2007, only 64 cases were
diagnosed. So far, there has been one fatality, an 8-year-old child.
Altogether, 62 600 people have been vaccinated against tick-borne
encephalitis. 25 800 ampules of immunoglobulin are available for
urgent treatment.

[ProMED-mail no longer routinely reports outbreaks of tick-borne
encephalitis, which is a vaccine-preventable disease. This update of
the situation in Kemerovo Oblast is posted to make readers aware that
the incidence of this disease may be on the increase, and travelers
to certain rural regions of Russia should be aware of this hazard.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), also known as Central European
encephalitis or Russian spring-summer encephalitis, is a flavivirus
infection of the central nervous system. The 2 most important
genotypes of tick-borne encephalitis virus are the European and Far
Eastern genotypes, transmitted by the hard ticks _Ixodes ricinus_ and
_I. persulcatus_, respectively. Human infections are acquired through
bites of infected ticks or, rarely, by ingesting unpasteurized dairy
products primarily from infected goats, sheep, or cows.

A comprehensive update on tick-borne encephalitis viruses and the
availability of vaccines can be found in the "CDC Health Information
for International Travel 2007-2008," handbook which is available
online at: <http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/ybToc.aspx>.
