A few comments on the recent posting:
1. Although few persons with group B rotavirus in China in the outbreaks in
the early 1980s died, many were in shock upon presentation for treatment.
2. Although few specific control measures were introduced, the group B
outbreaks in China subsided on their own. This contrasts with group A
rotavirus infections that are endemic in humans in all parts of the world,
infecting virtually all children before age 5 years.
3. Group A rotaviruses were first discovered in humans in the early 1970s,
but they did not "emerge" there or spread from there to the rest of the
world. Good epidemiologic evidence suggests that group A rotaviruses were
recognized clinically in Japan and the U.S.A. early in this century. Dr.
Hodes worked with group A rotaviruses in the 1940s, although lacking an
antigen test or electron microscopy he did not know that until after 1973.
4. Group B rotaviruses have been recognized in many parts of the world,
including in Baltimore, Maryland, by Bob Yolken and colleagues. It is
likely these infections represent epizootic exposures from pigs, cows, or
other animals. Like many such cross-species infections, the transmission
properties appear to be different than for similar viruses adapted and
endemic in humans.
