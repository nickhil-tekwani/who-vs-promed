Pennsylvania now says 20 people have been sickened by campylobacteriosis that may be related to raw milk from a Chambersburg-area farm. All of the people who are sick had consumed milk from the farm, called The Family Cow. But the state was still awaiting test results to determine if the milk is the cause of the illness. The illnesses involve 16 people from Pennsylvania and 4 from Maryland. They began getting sick about 2 weeks ago and some needed hospital care.

The Family Cow produces milk sold at The Healthy Grocer in Hampden Township, and also serves customers at a Cumberland County drop off location. The company voluntarily stopped selling milk, but has said independent tests found no harmful bacteria in raw milk from The Family Cow.

Raw milk is milk that hasn't undergone the normal pasteurization process intended to kill germs. Some people prefer raw milk because of their belief that it's healthier than normal milk. But health officials warn that raw milk can carry assorted germs that cause illness, and also say there are no proven health benefits of drinking raw milk.

[The number of recognized cases of campylobacteriosis, which is epidemiologically linked to the unpasteurized milk, has almost tripled over the few days since the outbreak was first posted on ProMED-mail. It is quite unlikely that there is another source other than the raw milk. - Mod.LL]
