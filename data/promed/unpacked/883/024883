A 66-year-old man being treated in hospital for Lassa fever has died
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The patient, from east London, died following a sudden deterioration
in his condition, said a spokesman from Hampstead's Royal Free
Hospital. The man, who has not been identified, had been travelling
in Nigeria and was admitted to hospital soon after returning to the
UK on 6 Jan 2009. Lassa fever was diagnosed on 22 Jan 2009 at the
Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Next of kin have been informed. A
spokeswoman from the Health Protection Agency (HPA) said there was no
risk of contamination to the public.

Lassa fever is caused by the Lassa virus and is endemic in Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and the Central African Republic.
Hundreds of thousands of people are infected in these countries each
year and isolated cases have been seen in Europe and the USA. Around 8
in 10 people infected with Lassa virus develop mild or no symptoms,
but in 20 percent of cases people will have severe illness. Symptoms
include fever, headache, sore throat, a cough, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhoea, and muscle pain. A common complication is deafness, but
only about 2 percent of all patients die from the illness.

Dr Dilys Morgan, a Lassa fever expert at the HPA, said: "This is an
isolated case. It is important to stress that there is no risk to the
general public from this patient. "Lassa fever is an infection that is
found in West Africa and is seen rarely in this country in those who
have travelled to parts of the world where it is common. The virus is
spread by infected rats through their urine and droppings. The
infection is not easily spread to others and then only by direct
contact with bodily fluids."

There have been 10 confirmed cases of Lassa fever in the UK since 1970.
