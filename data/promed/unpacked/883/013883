Scarlet fever cases in Lincolnshire [England] have rocketed by 350 percent, latest official figures show. And with many more youngsters affected than in the same period in 2014, public health experts are reminding parents, schools, and nurseries to be aware of the symptoms.

There have been 27 notifications of scarlet fever in Lincolnshire in the 1st 6 weeks of 2015, compared with 6 during the 1st 6 weeks of 2014. Some 1265 new cases were recorded in England in the 1st 6 weeks of the year [2015], with over 300 cases reported last week alone, according to data from Public Health England (PHE). This is said to be above expected levels for the time of year.

Last month [Feb 2015] parents, schools, and nurseries in North East Lincolnshire were urged to look out for signs of scarlet fever following a steep rise in the number of cases. Scarlet fever is a highly contagious bacterial illness that causes a distinctive pink-red rash, which feels like sandpaper to touch.

Between 8 Sep 2014 and 8 Feb 2015, 434 cases of scarlet fever were notified in North East Lincolnshire, with 14 000 recorded nationally in 2014.

Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance said: "As we enter into high season for scarlet fever, we ask GPs and other frontline medical staff to be mindful of the current high levels of scarlet fever activity when assessing patients. "Prompt notification of cases to local health protection teams is critical to enable local monitoring and rapid response to outbreaks. Schools and nurseries should similarly be mindful of the current elevated levels of scarlet fever and promptly inform local health protection teams at an early stage if they become aware of cases, especially if more than one child is affected."

[The scarlet fever outbreak that occurred throughout the UK in 2014 was worse than at any time in the past 50 years and has now resumed. Over a century ago, scarlet fever was feared as a potentially lethal disease. Its mortality and morbidity waned, however, well before antibiotics became available. Since the advent of antibiotic therapy, the mortality rate of treated scarlet fever remains less than one percent.

Community-wide outbreaks still occur, as happened in Hong Kong in 2011 (see prior ProMED-mail posts in 2011 on scarlet fever in Hong Kong). A discussion of scarlet fever can be found in the moderator's comments in ProMED-mail post Streptococcus, group A, scarlet fever - UK: (England) 20130525.1737001.
