City health officials are warning the public to avoid eating unpasteurized cheese after an El Paso man was hospitalized with brucellosis.

Health officials said the man, who is in his 60s, ate goat cheese that was purchased from an unlicensed food vendor, and became ill with a fever, joint pain, and fatigue. "We want our residents to keep in mind that purchasing food from an illegal vendor can be very dangerous. One should assume all cheese sold on the street is unpasteurized," said Robert Resendes, public health director.

Brucellosis is a disease caused by bacteria usually found in unpasteurized or raw dairy products. Symptoms include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, joint or muscle pain, and fatigue. Some symptoms may last longer than others while some may never go away or reoccur, health officials said. Those symptoms include recurrent fevers, arthritis, swelling of the testicle and scrotum area, swelling of the heart, neurologic symptoms, chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver or spleen. Health officials said recovery may take a few weeks to several months, and death from brucellosis is considered rare.

[The source of the cheese is not stated but given that El Paso is a border town, Mexico is the likely source. Given that the cheese was made from goat milk, the organism is likely to be _Brucella melitensis._

Brucellosis is just one of many infectious diseases that can be spread through unpasteurized milk or dairy products. Others include salmonellosis, listeriosis, campylobacteriosis, bovine tuberculosis, and infections due to enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_. - Mod.LL
