The Seychelles government would like to request that you remove the
reference to Seychelles. I can confirm that the Seychelles Ministry of
Health does not have a record of any persons contracting chikungunya
virus in the country.

Grand Isle or "Grande ile" in French [citing the original report] is
another name for Madagascar, and no such place exists in Seychelles.
Seychelles has not registered any confirmed case of chikungunya since
2006. Earlier this year [2011], there were a few clinical suspicions,
but tests carried out in a laboratory overseas confirmed that they
were not chikungunya [virus infections]. We have a very active system
of surveillance and alert, one of the best in the region, and we
report any case of disease outbreak to the World Health Organisation.
WHO can confirm that we have not reported any such outbreaks.

This link [the source cited in ProMED-mail post 20110421.1239] is not
an official announcement by the organization in question, it is a post
of a poorly translated article from a Madagascar website in French.
All the references made to cases of the virus are about Madagascar.
One reference is made to Seychelles in the opening line, but no source
or quantity of cases are given. It is pure speculation on behalf of
the journalist.

Given the inaccuracies of the article used as a source that you
posted online, we urge you to remove the references to the
Seychelles.

[ProMED thanks Tonia Bussolini and Srdjana Janosevic for correcting
the inaccuracy in the source of the 21 Apr 2011 ProMED-mail post
(archive no. 20110421.1239) and regrets any inconvenience that it may
have caused.

It is indeed good news that there are no recorded chikungunya virus
infections in the Seychelles this year (2011). The error was one of
inaccurate reporting in the original article, not one of an inaccurate
translation. The original report was translated by a native French
speaker, who re-checked the translation and indicated that: "The
article states that "several cases of chikungunya were detected in the
Seychelles and in Madagascar." It also states that there are "...a
growing number of people who contracted the disease in the
Seychelles." ProMED frequently has to rely on the popular press for
timely disease outbreak information. Unfortunately, in this case,
although the Madagascar information was probably accurate, the
Seychelles information was not. - Mod.TY]
