Year-to-date, the rates of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia cases in Snohomish County are way up. This county saw the sharpest increase in sexually transmitted disease (STD) cases for these 3 STDs compared to King and Pierce counties. Researchers do not yet know why, or where, or among whom, STDs are more prevalent. A Snohomish Health District epidemiologist is expected to release a report this week with detailed data.

For syphilis cases in Snohomish County, health officials have seen a more than 120 per cent spike this year -- with 87 cases in 2016 versus 39 cases at this time last year [2015]. In 2014, the last high year, there were a little fewer than 70 syphilis cases the whole year. Among the state's 4 largest counties, only Spokane County has had a larger spike, with 113 cases reported this year.

Chlamydia, sometimes marked by a burning sensation while urinating, saw a 15 percent increase here -- 1800 cases overall so far versus about 1600 last year [2015]. Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics.

Gonorrhea, which sometimes shows itself among men by strange-colored discharges, saw a 23 percent increase. There have been 506 cases reported in this county so far. King County, which has about 1.1 million more people than Snohomish County, has seen about 4 times as many gonorrhea cases. The month-to-month trend lines for Snohomish County have wavered, but the sheer numbers of cases for these 3 STDs are markedly up from last year.

The spread "speaks to the need of more prevention and education," health district spokeswoman Heather Thomas said last week. Condoms are commonly considered a proven way to avoid STDs if used properly and every time. STD tests are not difficult to obtain. Typically, your doctor can refer you to get tested, and some clinics can start the testing process on-site. Usually a test for everything called a "full panel test" and it involves collecting pee and blood samples.

The Snohomish Health District's STD Clinic at its headquarters at 3020 Rucker Ave is available to men who have sex with men [MSM], to anyone who doesn't have health insurance and anyone showing STD symptoms. This clinic is primarily intended to check for HIV. A Planned Parenthood center at 1509 32nd St in Everett also has STD testing. It's a block south of Pacific Avenue and west of Hoyt Avenue. Their number is 425-339-3389.

One STD not spiking here is herpes: new herpes cases are steady from last year [2015].
