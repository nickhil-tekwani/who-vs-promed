Waterfowl hunters who venture out this opening weekend [12-13 Oct 2013] may see fewer birds in the Fort Boise Wildlife Management Area [Idaho], since 600 mallard ducks and other waterfowl have died in the past month [September-October 2013] from a botulism outbreak.

Evin Oneale, regional conservation educator for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game, said officials 1st discovered the disease was affecting the birds in the area near Parma in early September [2013]. The strain is not one that is transmissible to humans.

"It's a pretty common disease this time of year," Oneale said. "The birds are concentrated on a few ponds out there, and when you have wildlife concentrated like that, the disease transmission is pretty high."

When one bird carrying the disease dies, flies and maggots feed off the carcass and nearby birds eat those bugs, he said. That can sometimes mean thousands or tens of thousands of bird deaths, so he said they felt "pretty fortunate" the number was comparatively low.

To contain the outbreak, Oneale said workers have been collecting and promptly disposing of carcasses in the area.

"The good news is, we've seen no dead ducks in the last 10 days, so it appears the botulism has run its course," Fish and Game Habitat Biologist Andy Ogden said. "The bad news is, the outbreak killed considerable numbers of local ducks, and these are normally the birds harvested in the 1st few days of the waterfowl season."

Oneale said he hasn't heard of any other botulism outbreaks in Idaho.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Outbreaks of botulism in wild aquatic birds are a natural phenomenon in North America. - Mod.PMB
