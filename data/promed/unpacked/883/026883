Fraser Health, British Columbia Centre for Disease Control, and the BC Drug and Poison Information Centre are warning the public not to consume Wing Hing brand sand ginger powder because it may contain poisonous monkshood powder.

This recall comes after Fraser Health began an investigation into the sand ginger powder after 2 people presented to the hospital in early February [2022] with heart irregularities after consuming the product.

The recalled Wing Hing Trading Co. Ltd. product was sold in the Crystal Mall, Unit 1162-4500 Kingsway, Burnaby, B.C.

According to the health alert, monkshood is the common name for a plant called _Aconitum_. Roots of the plant, which look very similar to ginger root, contain the toxin aconitine which can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, weakness, irregular ventricular contractions, and in severe cases, death.

Wing Hing brand sand ginger powder was sold in 70 gram [2.5 oz] packages. There is no identifying lot information on the packaging.

Fraser Health Public Health advises people who have this sand ginger powder to not consume it and discard it immediately.

Fraser Health has seized the remaining product from the store and continues to work with other agencies to ensure it is further removed from the marketplace.

[Sand ginger, a part of the galangal family has a very different taste than does the common Chinese ginger.

Sand ginger has been used to treat some bacterial issues such as Staph infections and reportedly, some cancers.

Its taste is reported to be a sharp peppery taste when used fresh. As a dried product, it is said to have a slight cinnamon flavor but a still sharp peppery taste.

According to the article, this is a dried product, not fresh. It is not clear if the _Aconitum_ was growing in the field and some of the roots were mistakenly harvested or if someone did not know the differences in the plants.

The _Aconitum_ family is a very large group (over 250 species) of flowering plants with a large number of different common names, leaf shapes and flower colors. Among the common names are monkshood (please see the photos) mousebane, wolf's-bane, leopard's bane, women's bane, devil's helment, blue rocked, queen of poisons. This is a very toxic group of plants.

The genus _Aconitium_ contains the toxic agent aconitine and other related alkaloids, especially in the roots and tubers. The toxic agent Aconitine is a very potent neurotoxin and cardiotoxin. It causes a persistent depolarization of neuronal sodium channels in tetrodotoxin-sensitive tissues. The sodium influx in these channels delays the repolarization causing excitability and potentially leading to diarrhea, convulsions, ventricular arrhythmia, and death. These conditions require immediate treatment.

Skin contact with the plant generally does not result in clinical signs, but on occasion paraesthesia, including tingling and feelings of coldness in the extremities, has been reported, as has mild toxicity (headache, nausea, and palpitations).

Clinical signs start as quickly as immediately but generally within one hour. Without rapid treatment death usually follows in 4-6 hours.

Treatment is primarily supportive for the blood pressure and cardiac rhythm (it could vary from tachycardia to bradycardia, but more frequently seems to be bradycardia). Evacuation of the gastrointestinal tract may be beneficial in reducing toxin absorption. In some patients, the use of activated charcoal has been helpful.

_Aconitum_ sp. (also known as Monk's hood, please see photos below):
"This is a genus of over 250 species of herbaceous perennials of which most are extremely poisonous. They are mostly found in mountainous areas of the northern hemisphere in moist but well-drained soils in forests, natural areas, moist woods and sitting along creek banks. These plants will grow better in cool summer areas.

"The plants generally have lobed to deeply lobed leaves with toothed margins and clusters of flowers with the characteristic upper hood giving it the common name of Monk's Hood and Helmet Flower. The showy flowers appear in summer and range in color from blues, purples to white.

"Plant in humus-rich moist soil that drains well. In the southern portion of its range, it will need afternoon sun. Use in groups, borders or naturalized areas. After flowering, cut the plants back to promote re-blooming.

"Although used in the landscape, Monkshood is poisonous, with a narcotic juice present in the leaves and roots. Do not plant near the vegetable garden, where its fleshy roots could be mistaken for Jerusalem artichokes. Wearing gloves is advisable when handling this plant."

There are a number of different species and colors of Monkshood. All are toxic.
