The number of cases of a deadly disease has more than doubled in the
last decade, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dengue
outbreaks are now a major threat to global public health. The UN
health agency warned that unless countries act now then the situation
will only get worse.

The WHO has warned that the increased number and size of dengue
outbreaks in some countries in the Western Pacific region, as well as
cases recorded in previously unaffected areas, are signs that firmer
action cannot be delayed. The number of cases in the Western Pacific
Region has more than doubled over the past 10 years. There has been a
significant increase in many countries this year [2010] alone.

40 percent of the world's population are at risk of the disease, with
the majority living in the Asia Pacific region. Out of these 2.5
billion people, more than 70 percent live in Asia Pacific countries.
500 000 people hospitalised each year. Children are most at risk of
dying.

The increased number of outbreaks may be caused by a number of
factors; including higher temperatures and rainfall, which produce
perfect breeding conditions for the mosquitoes that carry the disease
[viruses]. Growing populations, particularly in cities, and greater
international travel by infected individuals could also explain the
rise. The WHO says there is as yet no clear evidence that the
increase in cases was due to global warming. But changes in climate
do affect mosquitoes which spread the disease [viruses].

At a local level eliminating breeding sites like water jars, building
sites, and discarded garbage is essential in reducing the number of
mosquitoes. But a concerted international effort is vital, with urban
planning and improving sanitation essential to reducing the number of
dengue cases.

Health institutes are giving conflicting reports about the number of
patients diagnosed with dengue fever in the country. While
[Pakistan's] National Institute of Health (NIH), the primary
institute for testing blood samples, says no patient has yet tested
positive for the disease, ministry of health officials and doctors at
government-run hospitals tell a different story. They say scores of
patients have been diagnosed with dengue and that too by NIH. These
conflicting reports, at the very least, point to a lack of
coordination between government health institutions.

"We receive blood samples from all over the country, but so far, no
one has been diagnosed with the disease," claimed Dr Jaleel Kamran of
Epidemic Investigation Cell at NIH on Saturday [16 Oct 2010]. However
Dr Rashid Jooma, director general Ministry of Health, denied NIH's
claims. He said 2000 patients suspected of suffering dengue fever had
been reported from across the country, out of which 1000 had tested
positive. "Almost all of the cases reported positive for dengue were
tested by NIH," he added. "All test samples of suspected dengue fever
patients coming to hospital were sent to NIH for tests," Dr Mehmood
Jamal concurred, who is the executive director of Pakistan Institute
of Medical Sciences.

[This report is confusing. It cites confirmed dengue cases diagnosed
in 4 major hospitals with confirmation by the NIH, yet an official
report from the same NIH indicated that no dengue virus infections
have been confirmed. The situation is further complicated by a 17 Oct
2010 report from Chen Qi
(<http://www.dowell-netherlands.com/2010/10/six-more-die-of-dengue-fever.html>)
that stated that 6 people died of dengue virus infections in Karachi
during the last 24 hours, raising the death toll to 12. Provincial
Dengue Surveillance Cell head Dr Shakeel Malik said 5 people died of
dengue in September 2010, while 7 fell victim to the disease in
October [2010]. The 14 Oct 2010 edition of The Nation
(<http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Islamabad/14-Oct-2010/NIH-confirms-1141-cases-of-dengue-fever>)
reported that NIH received blood samples of 2553 dengue-suspected
patients of which 1141 have been declared positive. This, and
previous reports from Pakistan, clearly indicate that dengue cases
have been occurring in Pakistan. Reporting may be complicated by
disruption of communications from dealing with the massive flooding
that occurred there recently. ProMED-mail would be interested in any
information that would resolve this apparent conflict in NIH
reporting. Providing timely diagnosis, care, treatment, and
prevention of dengue under the conditions inflicted by the recent
terrible flooding would be an extraordinarily difficult task.

Although according to the US CDC report the numbers of suspected
cases of dengue appear to have fallen, in practice, it would seem
otherwise. According to the CDC, at week 38 (17-23 Sep 2010) 757
cases were reported, indicating a decrease compared to previous
weeks. However, cases continue to be above the epidemic threshold,
which means that the dengue epidemic is continuing. With another
confirmed death, the CDC has confirmed 27 fatalities. Although they
have not reported how many people have been infected with DHF, it was
noted that there are more than 28, the same figure as they gave last
week.

This year [2010], the dengue epidemic has not paused in Paraguay. The
Ministry of Health could not announce the reduction in virus
transmission that usually happens in the colder months
(June-September). Paraguay has passed into the [dengue] endemic
category.

Now in mid-October, [dengue] case notifications continue to reach the
Ministry of Health from various departments [state of province
equivalent] of the country, as the rainy and hot season begins again,
which favors mosquito breeding, and therefore, dengue.

The 2009/2010 epidemic left a total of more than 20 000 people
affected by dengue in Paraguay. The magnitude was moderate but with
significant severity, because there were severe cases, said the
director general of Health Surveillance, Dr Ivan Allende.

419 dengue cases were reported in the country from January to 2 Oct
2010, an increase of 17 percent or 5411 cases compared with 32 008
cases recorded in the same period last year (2009). During the
period, 117 dengue deaths were reported, a surge of 65 percent or an
increase of 46 cases compared with the same period last year (2009).
The Malaysian government is researching on the possibility of using
genetically modified mosquitoes to control dengue
(<http://aglocojalurgemilang.blogspot.com/2010/10/dengue-death-cases-increases-by-65-in.html>).

- Philippines (Davao Oriental): 8 persons died of dengue fever in the
Caraga region (Davao Oriental region) while a total of 2369 cases
were admitted in different hospitals in the region from 1 Jan-8 Oct
2010, health officials reported Thursday (14 Oct 2010]. The number of
cases was 174 percent higher compared to 2009 when only 853 cases
were recorded
(<http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/282233/dengue-cases-rise-caraga?utm_medium=twitter>).

- Taiwan: a total of 111 new dengue fever cases originating in Taiwan
were reported during the week of 3 Oct 2010, setting a new single
week record, with most of the cases concentrated in southern Taiwan,
CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said at a news conference.
Shih also said all 4 serotypes of dengue virus have emerged
(<http://focustaiwan.tw/ShowNews/WebNews_Detail.aspx?Type=aSOC&ID=201010120025>).

number affected could be higher since not all patients come to
hospitals and that the statistical system is weak
(<http://www.elconfidencial.com/ultima-hora/2010/10/personas-afectadas-brote-dengue-nueva-delhi-20101012-375741.html>).

- Barbados: 321 cases of dengue fever with 3 reported deaths have
been confirmed, in comparison to 91 in 2009. The rise of dengue cases
was not restricted to Barbados, as there were 872 cases recorded in
the region this year up to July (2010), in comparison to 242 during
the same period last year (2009)
(<http://www.nationnews.com/index.php/articles/view/321-confirmed-cases-of-dengue/>).
