India
- National. 27 Jan 2017. Cases of dengue breached the 1-lakh [100 000] mark in India in 2016. The figure, [111 880] to be precise, was the highest in the last 7 years and indicated at the country-wide prevalence of the infectious disease. West Bengal topped the list at 17 702 cases followed by Punjab (10 475 cases). Deaths due to the vector-borne disease have also been highest at 227 in 2016, as per the data available from the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) of the Ministry. The notification also pointed out that dengue cases found positive through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) will not be considered as confirmed cases.

The move also followed observation that rapid diagnostic test kits for dengue had 50 per cent error rate, giving false positives cases, which was resulting in panic among people. However, the total tally for 2016 has been on the higher side with 111 880 cases reported from across the States. It was 99 913 in 2015, 40 571 in 2014, 75 808 in 2013.

As per the data, Uttar Pradesh has reported highest number of dengue deaths in 2016 with the figure standing at 42 against 9 last year [2015]. in contrast, Delhi which had reported highest number of deaths due to the disease at 2015, registered 10 deaths in the following year [2016].

The States which reported unprecedented rise in dengue cases were Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Kerala, Maharashtra, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Andaman and Nicobar, Dadar and Nagar Haveli. In comparison, Haryana, Chahattisgarh, Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Sikkim, were among those States that reported decrease in cases during the period... more

Other than a 50-year-old person from Sulur, all the remaining patients who were tested positive for dengue are aged below 23. CMCH authorities attributed that the spurt in the number of cases to winter climate when instances of dengue are generally high. "Treatment is given to the affected people at special ward quarantined exclusively for dengue cases. The blood bank has adequate stock of platelet to be used in case of emergency," said an official from CMCH.

Pacific
------
- Vanuatu. 5 Jan 2016. Vanuatu's Ministry of Health has confirmed there were 66 confirmed cases of
dengue fever at the end of December [2016]. Most cases of the mosquito borne disease are in Port Vila but it has the potential to spread to other parts of Vanuatu. A statement from the ministry of health said there were 359 suspected cases and only 66 were confirmed to be positive.

- Vanuatu. 27 Jan 2017. Dengue fever outbreak - Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA), Report from International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies. In November 2016, the Ministry of Health (MOH) observed an increased reported cases of dengue infection in the country. Like other Pacific Island countries and territories, Vanuatu is prone to dengue outbreaks and epidemics. The country has experienced 5 major outbreaks since 1970 -- the worst occurred in 1989 with over 3000 admissions and 12 deaths. Since the 1989 outbreak, the government has upgraded its surveillance and control system and developed dengue preparedness plans. With the rainy season in full effect from November to April, it is feared that this dengue outbreak could expand considerably without appropriate and timely intervention.
As of 23 Jan 2017, there were 919 suspected cases of dengue fever and 142 confirmed cases. There are more cases being reported and confirmed on Efate, Urban Port Vila, and nearby rural areas and cases are also coming in from Sola in Torba province, Luganville in Sanma, Emae in Shefa, Norsup in Malampa province, and Lenakel in Tanna, Tafea province. The current dengue epidemic of serotype 2 affects all age groups and therefore is a national threat that warrants national responsibility, public, private, and communal response.
Of the 919 suspected cases, 142 have been confirmed positive, 4 of them severe. 24 percent of the cases are found among children between 5 and 14, 24.2 percent are found among those between the ages of 15 and 24, and 19.4 percent are among those between 25 and 34, and 18.8 per cent of patients above the age of 34, that is 86.6 percent of cases have been found in the population above 4 years of age.
As of 9 Dec 2016, the Ministry of Health announced that they would no longer send all cases for testing. Only cases from new sites, severe dengue cases, and about 2 cases per day will be tested to detect potential introduction of new dengue virus serotypes and/or Zika virus and/or chikungunya virus. The number of confirmed cases may therefore not accurately reflect the true extent of the outbreak.
With this current situation, the National Dengue Task Force (NDTF) has issued a press statement to focus on education and awareness as the key preventive measure to control this epidemic. On 30 Dec 2016, the Ministry of Health, through the NDTF, established a stratified Orange Alert due to the growing number of cases of dengue fever in the country. Orange Alert for Port-Vila 4 municipal Ward, Yellow Alert for Efate rural areas, Lenakel-Tanna, Luganville-Santo, and Sola- Banks, and Green alert in the remaining areas of country where dengue cases were not reported. Alert levels may continue to vary according to the level of propagation and detection of cases.
On 17 Jan 2017, the Vanuatu Red Cross Society (VNRC) has received a formal request from the Director of the Public Health Department to assist the health response field teams to conduct community education and awareness, and to work closely with the national office of the Public Health Department as the lead coordinator in this response.
Currently, Vanuatu has had an increase in dengue cases that exceeds the trends in recent years. 4 out of the 6 provinces of Vanuatu have reported dengue cases, which may mean that the vector, the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is circulating in different parts of the country. Approximately 20 000 people across these 4 provinces are considered to be at risk should they not take preventive measures and get exposed to virus via mosquito bites.

- New Caledonia. 13 Jan 2017. After reporting 80 dengue fever cases since the beginning of the year, health authorities in New Caledonia have declared an epidemic on the South Pacific islands. Since the start of Dec. 2016, the territory has reported more than 160 dengue cases and a dozen people required hospitalization for their illness. The dengue strain circulating is DENV1. The island chain of Vanuatu is also experiencing a dengue outbreak; however, the strain involved is DENV2. New Caledonia experienced a dengue epidemic in 2003, which resulted in nearly 20 deaths.

[2] Philippines (Davao City, Mindanao): rapid diagnostic test
Date: Thu 5 Jan 2017
Source: Davao Today [edited]
http://davaotoday.com/main/economy/health/cho-debuts-dengue-rapid-testing-kit/


A diagnostic test kit able to detect low platelet counts in potential dengue victim's blood within minutes is now available the city's [Davao City, Mindanao] health centers this year [2017], City Health Officer Dr Josephine Villafuerte said in a press conference on [Thu 4 Jan 2017].

"If you go with traditional treatment, you will have to go to the hospital every day. Or if you get admitted, blood samples will be taken from you every day until such time that they detect a low platelet count wherein you will fall into the clinical definition of being positive with dengue," Villafuerte said in an interview with DavaoToday.

Villafuerte said the testing kit is not exactly new, since the kits have been in use since July 2016 in a limited fashion. The kits were only available in the city's main health center then because of low stock. This year, however, the kits are already available in all barangay health centers citywide. This kit however is not meant to replace the hospital equipment, but is only meant to give doctors an idea of a person's possibility of acquiring the dengue virus. A patient who has undergone check up with a doctor can then be given a referral to avail of the kits in the nearest health center. This faster method of detecting dengue can help diagnosis of the virus at an earlier stage, decreasing likelihood of death, Villafuerte said.

This comes as the City Health Office [CHO] launched its year round program against all mosquito related sickness such as dengue, malaria, filaria, and zika viruses for 2017. According to CHO's record, there were 3972 recorded dengue cases last year [2016], 335 more than that of 2015. CHO also recorded 29 dengue related deaths, 21 more than 2015.

The same record also shows that within the city, Buhangin District recorded the highest number of cases with 620, followed by Talomo South District with 553, while Paquibato recorded the lowest with 12 cases.

According to the City Information Office, CHO has already provided larvicides to Buhangin and Talomo South District as part of its efforts to reduce dengue cases. Larvicides are chemicals designed to prevent mosquito larvae from developing into adult mosquitoes.

"Dengue as a sickness will always be there, we cannot make it disappear completely because we cannot kill all mosquitoes. We can only decrease their numbers by depriving them of breeding sites," Villafuerte said.
