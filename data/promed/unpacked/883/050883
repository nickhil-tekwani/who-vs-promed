[Additional information on the AI situation in Iran, hopefully also
from official sources, is anticipated.

According to OIE's WAHID interface, no semi-annual or annual animal
health reports have been submitted from Iran for the years 2009 and
2010.

A regular reporting record is required from all OIE member countries.
Such reporting is conditional for the inclusion of a country in lists
of countries officially recognised as free of OIE-listed diseases. At
present, 4 diseases are included in this recognition procedure: CBPP
(contagious bovine pleuropneumonia), FMD (foot-and-mouth disease),
rinderpest, and BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy). - Mod.AS]
