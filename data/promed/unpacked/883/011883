On Wed 23 Feb 2022, the Government of Melilla confirmed a new case of rabies in a dog.

According to the General Directorate of Public Health and Consumer Affairs, the (about) 6 months old animal presented exceptional aggressive behavior on Mon 21 Feb 2022 and was captured the same day near the Beni Enzar border. A warning was published, encouraging the public to report any exposure to the suspected puppy before its collection.

The authorities have published today [23 Feb 2022] that the animal bit one person in the port at 5:30 a.m. on 21 Feb 2022, at 7:30 another (and his dog) in the Hippodrome neighborhood, and at 10 a.m., another person was bitten in the upper part of the Sepes industrial estate. Before being captured, another 2 people were bitten near the border.

So far, there are 5 people known to have been bitten by the dog. They are undergoing prophylactic anti-rabies treatment.

In addition, an attempt is being made to locate a man who had contact with the animal before it was captured and whose affiliation is unknown.

The General Directorate of Public Health and Consumption is in search of the origin of the dog and requests public help in locating other possible contacts and bites, especially the man who tried to hold the animal, trying to prevent it from biting the last 2 people in the vicinity of Beni-Enzar.

This case is the 7th rabies-positive dog in the autonomous city since the outbreak began about 5 months ago, in September 2021, and the 3rd case in 2022.

The current case takes place a month after the previous rabies-positive case, which also occurred in another puppy. In fact, after the detection of this case, Melilla authorities admitted that they were looking for the puppy's possible littermates.

[Rabies in puppies may, at times, lead to a large number of human exposures, and delayed recognition with potentially fatal outcomes. This, due to atypical disease signs and, in many cases, children being exposed. Luckily, the animal described in Melilla did present apparent behavioral changes, which were observed by attentive observers, leading to timely, active response of the authorities and the early detection and treatment of (hopefully, eventually all) of the exposed persons. The epidemiological investigation is being continued.

Mod.CRD's commentary in 20211024.8699231 is applicable:
"Spain (peninsular territory and islands) has been free of terrestrial rabies since 1978, with the exception of the case of rabies imported from Morocco declared in June 2013. The vaccination campaigns carried out in dogs gave excellent results, eradicating the disease in the entire national territory. Only in the Autonomous Cities of Ceuta and Melilla are there sporadically imported cases of rabies, in dogs and some horses." (https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/ganaderia/temas/sanidad-animal-higiene-ganadera/sanidad-animal/enfermedades/rabia/Rabia.aspx) (translated from Spanish).

"Spain has a National Surveillance Program for Rabies in animals. See the full document (in Spanish) at https://www.mapa.gob.es/es/ganaderia/temas/sanidad-animal-higiene-ganadera/programadevigilanciadelarabiaversionfinal_tcm30-561135.pdf."

The tiny Spanish (semi) enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla sit on the northern shores of Morocco's Mediterranean coast, surrounded by the Moroccan state. Both enjoy local autonomy and have their own governments, led by city presidents. Together they form the European Union's only land borders with Africa.
