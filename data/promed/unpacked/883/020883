I agree with the moderator; it seems unusual that the _Salmonella_ species,
and perhaps even the phage type, are not yet available, and also, that
there is no information on an epidemiological investigation, which would
have been interesting. My other comment is on the moderator's description
of the old British system of weights. Firstly, the UK is now officially
metric, though older people often still refer to their weight in stones and
pounds. "Avoirdupois" is not middle English but is French from "avoir du
pois," to have weight. As an Englishman born and raised with the non-metric
system, I was surprised and delighted to learn about the clove (7 pounds)
and tod (28 pounds), neither of which I had ever heard of. We always called
them half a stone and 2 stones. Interestingly, our old ton of 20
hundredweight (each hundredweight is 8 stone, or 112 lbs) is almost the
same as the metric tonne (1000kg). Anyone else know how to count to 144 on
their fingers?

[ProMED thanks the contributor for his comments. My derivation of the word
(from dictionary.com) is as follows: Avoirdupois is from Middle English
avoir de pois, goods sold by weight, from Old French aveir, property, goods
(from aveir, to have, from Latin habere, to have, to hold, to possess
property) + de, from (from the Latin) + peis, weight (from Latin pensum,
weight).
