Another mosquito-borne illness has made its way to Clark County's
horse population. According to local animal health officials, a horse
has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] after the
animal showed signs of illness.

The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture says this is the county's 1st
documented case of EEE, which is a viral disease transmitted by the
bite of an infected mosquito to humans, horses, birds, and other
animals.

"Finding a positive horse confirms that there are mosquitoes in the
area infected with EEE virus. These same mosquitoes could bite
people," said Health Officer Robert Leischow. "The positive horse
means that residents of Clark County need to be more vigilant in their
personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites, and it is
important that people contact their healthcare provider if they
suspect they have EEE illness."

Last month [August 2011], a 10-year-old horse in rural Clark County
tested positive for West Nile virus. And EEE has also been in horses
that live in Price and Taylor Counties, as well as 2 llamas in Dunn
County.

State Veterinarian Dr. Robert Ehlenfeldt says horse owners who have
not already had their animals vaccinated this year [2011] for EEE and
other mosquito-borne diseases should take this as a warning, and those
who have vaccinated should check with their veterinarians to see
whether a booster is indicated.

[Horse owners should heed the warnings and recommendations issued by
the state veterinarian. Vaccines for EEE are often combined with West
Nile virus and tetanus. All are needed for the protection of the
equine. - Mod.TG]
