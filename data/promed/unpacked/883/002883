A new study confirms that the rotavirus vaccine does indeed increase the
risk of intussusception, a rare form of intestinal blockage.
The vaccine was pulled from the market in 1999, after 9 reports of
intussusception occurred within the first 7 months of vaccine use, more
than double the cases reported in the previous 7 years, according to Dr.
Trudy Murphy and associates from the National Immunization Program of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia.
Intussusception occurs when the intestine telescopes into itself, causing
an obstruction of the bowel that is repaired surgically. During the studies
to support licensing of the rotavirus vaccine, only 5 cases of
intussusception were reported among more than 10 000 infants who received
the vaccine. Rotavirus is the number one cause of severe diarrhea in
infants and is responsible for countless visits to the doctor's office and,
sometimes, the emergency department.
An investigation of vaccinated infants confirms that the vaccine was indeed
the cause of the complication, according to a report in the 22 Feb 2001
issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
Of a total of 426 infants with intussusception 74 had received the
rotavirus vaccine, the report indicates, and most of these infants had
intussusception shortly after their vaccination.
Within the first 14 days after vaccination, the risk of intussusception was
10 times higher than normal, the authors report, and within the first 7
days after vaccination, the risk was 14 times higher than normal.
If the national rotavirus vaccination program were to continue, the
investigators estimate that the intussusception rate would increase by 28%
to 57%, or an additional 361 to 732 cases per year.
They note that severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus leads to 500 000 office
visits, 50 000 hospitalizations, and approximately 20 deaths annually in
the United States.
"Rotavirus vaccines with an improved safety profile are urgently needed,"
the authors conclude.
