First report of _Puccinia xanthii_ on sunflower in North America
----------------------------------------------------------------
TJ Gulya and LD Charlet, USDA-ARS Northern Crop Science Laboratory, Fargo,
ND 58105-5677. Plant Dis 2002; 86: 564, published online as D-2002-
0308-05N, 2002. Accepted for publication 31 Jan 2002.
_Puccinia xanthii_ Schwein., commonly known as cocklebur rust, is
circumglobal on species of _Xanthium_ and _Ambrosia_. This microcyclic rust
has been observed on oilseed sunflower (_Helianthus annuus_ L.) only in
Australia (1) and on ornamental sunflowers in South Africa (2).
In September 1999, large (4 to 10 mm), raised, chlorotic pustules were
observed on the adaxial leaf surface of oilseed sunflower plants (Dekalb
3790) near Hettinger, ND. Telia were associated with the pustules on the
abaxial leaf surface. No cocklebur (_X. strumarium_ L.) ... were found in
the field, but rust-infected cocklebur plants were collected several k[m]
... away. About 10 per cent of sunflower plants in the field were affected,
and generally only 1 or 2 pustules were observed on 1 or 2 leaves per
plant. In contrast, numerous leaves of cocklebur plants were infected with
12 or more pustules.
Teliospores from sunflower were brown, two-celled, and averaged 49 x 17
micrometers, with a distinctly thicker wall at the spore apex and a
persistent pedicel averaging 40 micrometers long. Teliospores from
cocklebur were morphologically similar to those from sunflower and averaged
46 x 16 micrometers. Size and morphology of teliospores from both hosts fit
the description of _P. xanthii_ (3). _P. xanthii_ can be distinguished
easily from the ubiquitous _P. helianthi_ Schwein. because the latter has
smaller telia (1 to 2 mm diameter) and produces wider teliospores (21 to 30
micrometers diameter). _P. xanthii_ was not found in surveys of 20 other
sunflower fields in southwestern North Dakota nor in 45 fields in eastern
ND in 1999, nor was [it] ... found in this or any other sunflower field in
2000 or 2001. [The relatively few pustules observed on oilseed sunflower
agree with the observation that oilseed sunflowers are much less
susceptible to _P. xanthii_ (4) than _Xanthium_ spp].
To our knowledge, this is the first report of _P. xanthii_ on cultivated or
wild sunflower in North America.

[_P. xanthii_ survives as mycelium in infected plant material (sunflower
and cocklebur). Time will tell whether _P. xanthii_ becomes a significant
pathogen on oilseed sunflower in North America. Major producers are India,
Russia, Ukraine, South Africa, Romania, and the US (especially in
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas.). About 95 per cent of
world production is the oilseed type, the remainder being the confectionery
type. -Mod.DH]
