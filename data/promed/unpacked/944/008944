The destruction of a flying fox camp has been undertaken over the
previous fortnight in Bundall, less than 40 km [25 mi] away. This is
well within the nightly distance that a flying fox might travel.

Dr Hume Field (principal veterinary epidemiologist, Emerging Diseases
Group, Biosecurity Queensland) has previously hypothesised that
dispersals (such as occurred at Bundall) and other human actions that
stress the bats might have a role in spillover events such has
occurred at Kerry. See
http://www1.abcrc.org.au/uploads/8aee9ac0-1355-4339-b5b6-5772a4ee6cf7/docs/HeV_Review_updated170909.pdf

The camp destruction at Bundall was undertaken in an effort to reduce
the risk of [hendravirus infection] to horses stabled on the land
where the camp was located.

No monitoring of animals prior to the camp destruction was
undertaken. No plans were made to monitor animals after the camp
destruction -- this would have required the fitting of radio collars
to a statistically significant number of animals prior to the event.
As a result it is not possible to test Dr Field's thesis on this
occasion.

For more information about the camp destruction at Bundall see
http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/newsweb/t_news_item.aspx?pid=9555.

Finally, it has been reported that the vet who attended the animal
did not follow the proscribed safety protocols. These guidelines call
for breathing and eye mask as well as other barrier protection. See
http://www.dpi.qld.gov.au/4790_13371.htm. This document also
describes the quarantine placed on a property were hendravirus has
been reported. In respect of the question raised about the media
report that the people on the property have been quarantined, it
appears that this is an error in the reporting.

[ProMED-mail very much appreciates "eyes and feet" on the ground to
help us sort out this type of thing.

It clearly makes sense that disruption of the fox camp would stress
the animals, possibly triggering the shedding of virus. It is very sad
that better plans were not made prior to the destruction of the camp.
Such planning might well have advanced our understanding of
hendravirus. - Mod.TG]
