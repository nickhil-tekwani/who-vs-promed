[1] Cholera - Ghana (national)

Cholera outbreak in Ghana has hit a record 17 000 cases with 150 deaths [case fatality rate = 0.8 percent - Mod.LL]. The last time Ghana suffered such a staggering number of cholera cases was in 1982.

Signs of the cholera outbreak were on the wall after heavy rains consistently exposed most markets in Accra as filthy. Foul smell of rubbish assailed the air as it sat by road sides and remained uncollected for days. Health officials warned that the disease caused by poor sanitary conditions and lack of good hygienic practices could break out.

In July 2014, the prediction became real with cases first reported in Accra. Most of the cases are from La Community, some from Osu, Teshie. Since then, the rise has been unrelenting with health facilities overburdened.

The Greater Accra Regional Directorate of the Ghana Health Service in August 2014 officially declared the outbreak ravaging parts as an epidemic. All regions in Ghana except the Northern Region have recorded cases.

Dr Joseph Teye-Nuetey, the Volta Regional Health Director disclosed to citifmonline.com said the Ketu-South district recorded the highest number of cases, with 175 cases and 2 deaths.

He said Atebubu-Amantin District recorded the highest cases of 44 out of which 4 people have died. Dr Issah said the district recorded outbreaks in 2011 and 2012 in a particular community because of their source of drinking water. The assembly therefore is making efforts to solve the problem by treating their source of drinking water, examining food vendors and organizing clean up exercises.

The Volta Regional Director for health, Dr Nuertey said the Volta Region has seen a reduction in cholera cases contrary to reports that the incidence of the disease has doubled.

Meanwhile, reports reaching Radio Ghana reveal that 4 deaths from cholera cases have been recorded in the Eastern Region as the number of affected persons keeps increasing daily. The deaths occurred at Birim Central Municipality Nsawam Adoagyiri and Atiwa Districts. This was disclosed by the Acting Disease Control Officer at the Regional Health Directorate, Angela Quaye, in an interview with a Radio Ghana in Koforidua.

She said the Eastern Region has recorded 1200 cholera cases in 15 districts and a municipality, with West Akim leading with 341; Nsawam-Adoagyiri Municipality comes next with 309 cases followed by New Juaben Municipality with 161 cases. Mrs Quaye said all the necessary steps to help prevent the outbreak have been put in place, but human attitude continues to be a major hindrance with filth engulfing the society.

[There seems to be a discrepancy regarding cases in the Volta Region in 2 of these postings, one stated that the number of cases is decreasing and the other stating that it is increasing. Both statements are attributed to the same person. - Mod.LL]

[5] Diarrhea, fatal - Somalia (Lower Juba Region)

At least 3 children died in Fafahdun locality in Lower Juba region after a diarrhea outbreak. The administrator of Fafahdun locality Adan Shuqul Nunow confirmed to Local Radio In Mogadishu that the death of the children is due to contracting waterborne diseases after drinking contaminated water, such as acute [watery] diarrhea [a euphemism for cholera - Mod.LL]

He stated that there are more people who were hospitalized after contracting the waterborne disease in the area, adding that their number increases day after day. Mr Shuquul said acute water shortage in the region, particularly Fafahdun locality, has encouraged many families to move to other areas in search of clean water and forced the remaining people to take dirty water, hence the spread of waterborne diseases.

The administrator underlined the price of the available water in the area has doubled, a drum of water [how many liters?] reaching 350 000 Somali shillings (USD 18) [sic: but USD18 = 13 000 Somali shillings. - JW], unaffordable to most of the people as water tankers fetch water from far areas. He called the federal government, interim Juba administration and humanitarian aid agencies to deliver emergency support to the residents.

[Cholera has been reported in Somalia but it is unclear if these cases represent _Vibrio cholerae_ infection. In these cases, a drought has caused the population to seek water in unsafe places. Many outbreaks of the enteric infection are associated with the other end of water availability, overt flooding.
