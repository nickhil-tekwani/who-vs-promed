Situation summary in the Americas
---------------------------------
Since epidemiological week (EW) 44 of 2016 [29 Oct-4 Nov 2016], no additional countries or territories of the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus. To date, 48 countries and territories in the Americas have confirmed autochthonous, vector-borne transmission of Zika virus since 2015 (Figure 1). In addition, 5 countries in the Americas have reported sexually transmitted Zika cases.

North America
In the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health reported isolated local transmission cases.

In Mexico, new cases continue to be reported, although they have been decreasing since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016].

Central America
The number of reported cases in Central America continues to decrease, with a weekly average of 335 cases, 275 suspected, and 60 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks (EW 6 to EW 9 of 2017) [4 Feb-3 Mar 2017].

In Costa Rica a slight increase of suspected and confirmed cases was reported in EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017].

In Panama there was increasing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 and EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017]. Although there was a decrease in EW 2 of 2017 [week ending 13 Jan 2017], suspected and confirmed cases continue to be reported at a weekly average of 229 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.

Caribbean
In Aruba an increasing trend in suspected and confirmed cases was reported between EW 29 of 2016 and EW 4 of 2017 [16 Jul 2016-27 Jan 2017]. In the last 4 weeks, there was a weekly average of 53 suspected and confirmed cases.

In Curaçao, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 31 and EW 47 of 2016 [30 Jul-25 Nov 2017].

In Guadeloupe and Martinique a low circulation of the virus continues to be reported with a few sporadic confirmed cases in the last five weeks (EW 1 of EW 5 of 2017) [1 Jan-3 Feb 2017].

While other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, there is a decreasing trend in the sub-region with a weekly average of 340 cases in the last 4 weeks.

South America
In Argentina in EW 8 of 2017 [week ending 24 Feb 2017], 2 autochthonous cases were confirmed for the 1st time in the province of Salta (one case) and in the province of Chaco (one case), the latter case had a history of having stayed in the province of Formosa during the probable period of infection. In 2016, autochthonous cases had been confirmed in the provinces of Córdoba and Tucumán.

In Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 5 of 2017 [14 Oct 2016-3 Feb 2017].

In Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1 Jan-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto. In 2017 cases were reported in new districts of the departments of Loreto, San Martín, and Ucayali.

In other countries of South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 396 cases (353 suspected and 43 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.

Trend in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America
Figure 2 shows the trend of suspected and confirmed cases in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America. Incidence rate peaked in EW 7 of 2016 [week ending 19 Feb 2016] for all 3 sub-regions; from that point onwards in Central America and South America a downward trend occurs. In contrast, in the Caribbean, a growing trend occurred with a peak observed in EW 23 of 2016 [week ending 10 Jun 2016]. Since EW 40 of 2016 [week ending 7 Oct 2016], the trend has remained stable in all 3 sub-regions.

[3] Persistence in brain and placenta
Date: March 2017 [ahead of print]
Source: Emerging Infectious Diseases journal [edited] https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/3/16-1499_article


Ref: Bhatnagar J, Rabeneck DB, Martines RB, et al: Zika virus RNA replication and persistence in brain and placental tissue. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(3): 405-14. doi: 10.3201/eid2303.161499
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Zika virus is causally linked with congenital microcephaly and may be associated with pregnancy loss. However, the mechanisms of Zika virus intrauterine transmission and replication and its tropism and persistence in tissues are poorly understood. We tested tissues from 52 case-patients: 8 infants with microcephaly who died and 44 women suspected of being infected with Zika virus during pregnancy. By reverse transcription PCR, tissues from 32 (62 percent) case-patients (brains from 8 infants with microcephaly and placental/fetal tissues from 24 women) were positive for Zika virus. In situ hybridization localized replicative Zika virus RNA in brains of 7 infants and in placentas of 9 women who had pregnancy losses during the 1st or 2nd trimester. These findings demonstrate that Zika virus replicates and persists in fetal brains and placentas, providing direct evidence of its association with microcephaly. Tissue-based reverse transcription PCR extends the time frame of Zika virus detection in congenital and pregnancy-associated infections.

[The evidence of Zika virus infection of and persistence in fetal tissues and the placenta continue to accumulate. This study adds to those observations.

A 9 Mar 2017 report indicates that a new study shows the human fetus may be most vulnerable to Zika infection very early in pregnancy. In addition, the lesser-known African strain of Zika might possibly cause nearly immediate death of the placenta. (http://www.futurity.org/zika-miscarriage-placenta-1376622-2/). - Mod.TY]

[4] Cardiovascular complications
Date: Thu 9 Mar 2017
Source: American College of Cardiology [edited]
http://www.acc.org/about-acc/press-releases/2017/03/09/13/25/researchers-sound-alarm-over-zikas-potentially-harmful-heart-effects


As the Zika virus continues to spread globally, new evidence has emerged about the virus's potentially detrimental effects on the heart, according to data scheduled for presentation at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session [17-19 Mar 2017].

The study -- the 1st to report Zika-related heart troubles following infection -- included adult patients with no prior history of cardiovascular disease who were treated at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Caracas, Venezuela, one of the epicenters of the Zika virus outbreak. All but one patient developed a dangerous heart rhythm problem and 2/3 had evidence of heart failure, a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

"Our report provides clear evidence that there is a relationship between the Zika virus infection and cardiovascular complications," said Karina Gonzalez Carta, MD, cardiologist and research fellow at the department of cardiovascular diseases at Mayo Clinic and the study's lead author. "Based on these initial results, people need to be aware that if they travel to or live in a place with known Zika virus and develop a rash, fever or conjunctivitis, and within a short timeframe also feel other symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath or their heart skipping beats, they should see their doctor."

Carta and her team were not entirely surprised by their findings as they follow trends seen with other mosquito-borne diseases known to affect the heart, including the dengue and chikungunya virus [infections]. However, she noted that the burden and severity of heart problems, including rapidly progressive heart failure and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, among these patients was unexpected.

The 9 patients who were seen in the clinic in Caracas within one week of having Zika-type symptoms and who subsequently reported common symptoms of heart problems, most commonly palpitations followed by shortness of breath and fatigue, were included in this small, prospective case report. Only one patient had any previous cardiovascular problems (well-controlled high blood pressure), and lab tests confirmed that all had active Zika infection. Patients were asked to fill out a form to record their symptoms and underwent an initial electrocardiogram, a test that displays the electrical activity of the heart, which in 8 cases was suggestive of a problem with the rate or rhythm of their heartbeat. These findings prompted researchers to perform a full cardiovascular work up using an echocardiogram, (24-hour) Holter monitor, and a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging study. Of the 9 patients, 6 were female with a mean age of 47 ± 17 years. They were followed for an average of 6 months, beginning in July 2016.

Dangerous arrhythmias were detected in 8 of the 9 patients: 3 cases of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and 2 cases of ventricular arrhythmias, which can be deadly. Heart failure was present in 6 cases. Of these, 5 patients had heart failure with low ejection fraction -- when the amount of blood the heart is able to squeeze out is much less than what it normally would be -- and one had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction along with pre-eclampsia and a moderate to severe amount of fluid around the heart (called pericardial effusion). So far, none of the patients' cardiac issues have resolved, though symptoms are much improved due to guideline-directed treatment for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. Of note, cardiovascular symptoms tend to manifest later in the process. Data show an average lag of 10 days from patients' initial complaints of Zika symptoms to reports of symptoms suggestive of heart problems.

"Since the majority of people with Zika virus infections present with mild or non-specific symptoms and symptoms of cardiovascular complications may not occur right away, we need to raise awareness about the possible association," Carta said.

Although cardiovascular manifestations are fairly rare against the total number of patients treated at the clinic, Carta believes many more cases will be diagnosed, not only in patients with clear symptoms, but also among those with less severe or no signs of myocarditis, an inflammation of the myocardium, the middle layer of the heart wall. Myocarditis can affect the heart's muscle and electrical system.

"It's likely that many more people are affected, especially as many clinicians and people may not make the connection between symptoms," Carta said. "We need larger, systematic studies to understand the actual risk of Zika-related cardiac problems and what makes one patient more prone to develop them."

For now, she advises that people who are traveling to areas with known Zika virus consider talking with their doctor so they know what basic measures can be taken to prevent infection. Researchers are continuing to follow these patients and are setting up new strategies to screen more patients for cardiovascular problems.

Symptoms of the Zika virus usually include mild fever, skin rash, conjunctivitis (pink eye), muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache, which typically last for 2 to 7 days, according to the World Health Organization. The best way to prevent the Zika virus is by preventing mosquito bites.

While this study points to another potential risk of Zika virus infection, it is limited due to its small size. What remains unclear is whether and how the Zika virus might affect people with existing heart disease. However, Carta says that based on our knowledge of other arboviral infections, patients who have pre-existing cardiovascular disease tend to have worse outcomes.

Carta will present the study, "Myocarditis, Heart Failure and Arrhythmias in Patients With Zika," on Sat 18 Mar 2017, at the American College of Cardiology's 66th Annual Scientific Session in Washington.

[5] Persistence in donated whole blood
Date: May 2017 [ahead of print]

https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/5/16-1631_article


Ref: Mansuy JM, Mengelle C, Pasquier C, et al: Zika virus infection and prolonged viremia in whole-blood specimens. Emerg Infect Dis. 2017; 23(5); doi: 10.3201/eid2305.161631
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
We tested whole-blood and plasma samples from immunocompetent patients who had had benign Zika virus infections and found that Zika virus RNA persisted in whole blood substantially longer than in plasma. This finding may have implications for diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic infections and for testing of blood donations.

[Results]
---------
Results from the follow-up (18 whole-blood and 21 plasma samples) showed that the median duration of Zika virus was 22 (range 14-100) days in whole blood and 10 (range 7-37) days in plasma (p=0.058). Mean viral loads of positive samples were 3.39 log copies/mL in whole blood (n=13) and 2.52 log copies/mL in plasma (n=6; p=0.001). Viral loads in the last positive samples varied from 2.7 to 3.9 log copies/mL in whole blood and 2.2 to 2.8 log copies/mL in plasma (p=0.06). Whole-blood samples from 2 patients remained positive at 14 and 63 days after their plasma samples had become negative.

[Conclusion]
------------
Overall, our data show that use of whole-blood specimens is much more sensitive than use of plasma samples to detect Zika virus RNA. These data could be useful in recommending the use of whole blood instead of plasma for the molecular diagnosis of acute symptomatic and asymptomatic Zika virus infections and for the safety of whole blood and blood components from donors, as well as for the safety of organs, tissues, and cells from deceased and living donors.

Sperm donated in 3 Florida counties since [15 Jun 2016] may be infected with the Zika virus, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cautioned [Mon 13 Mar 2017]. "When semen is donated it can be stored frozen for periods of time. It does not necessarily inactivate Zika, so it could be stored in tissue banks, used subsequently, and people should be made aware," said Dr Peter Marks, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the US Food and Drug Administration. He went on to say having this information can help individuals make informed decisions and they "might want to use these donations from other sources." Sources other than the 12 sperm banks in Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties of Florida, that is.

The agency had previously designated only Miami-Dade County as an area to take precautions after the 1st local transmission of the virus in the continental United States was confirmed in the Wynwood neighborhood of Miami in July [2016]. The area was declared Zika free in December [2016].

The 1st known sexual transmission of Zika virus in US was 8 years ago. However, the CDC is now warning anyone in Palm Beach and Broward counties to also consider themselves at an increased risk for the virus. This applies to anyone who has traveled to or between these 3 counties since 15 Jun 2016, a change from previous guidance that designated 29 Jun [2016] as the start of the increased risk period.

It is possible that someone could have Zika without knowing, because an estimated 80 percent of those infected have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include fever, rash, joint pain, and red eyes, and they can last from a few days to about a week.

Pregnant women are at greatest risk because they can unknowingly pass the virus to their fetus, causing devastating consequences including miscarriage and neurological deficits that last a lifetime.

Because the virus can also be sexually transmitted, pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant have been advised to avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has been infected or who has lived in or traveled to an area where the virus is circulating.

The ongoing investigation into reported cases of the virus in Florida has found that residents of Miami-Dade, Palm Beach, and Broward counties travel frequently between the counties and either forget, or fail to, consider that they've visited an area of increased risk, thus not realizing they could be infected.

Women who live in these 3 counties who have become pregnant since 15 Jun [2016] are advised to speak with their physicians about the potential increased risk as are women who want to use a sperm donation from a donor in these counties, advised Dr. Denise Jamieson, incident commander for the CDC Zika emergency response and chief of the women's health and fertility branch at the CDC's division of reproductive health.

CDC officials said they are acting only out of an abundance of caution and there have not been any reports of the virus being transmitted through donated sperm.

"Now we understand more than we did months ago is that evidence of the Zika virus is present in semen for up to 3 months after a man is infected and people may not have accurately recalled potential exposure [to the virus] especially if in a local area," said Dr Matthew Kuehnert, who is part of the CDC Zika emergency response team and director of the CDC office of blood, organ and other tissue safety.

Unlike blood donations, which are routinely screened for the virus in the United States, there is no available test to screen semen for Zika. The existing test is still in the research phase and accuracy is being assessed, which is why men in these counties should not donate sperm. Their donated sperm may be infected.

The Florida Department of Health last reported a case of local transmission of the virus on [2 Mar 2017]. However, that report included confirmation of 2 cases from October of last year [2016]. A 3rd case was also reported then but this was an individual who donated blood in January [2017] and through routine blood screening was found to have previously been infected but no longer had an active case of the virus.

[Although this may seem like an over precautious stance, the risk of Zika virus transmission from donated sperm is small but real. The consequence of fetal infections is serious for families that have to deal with the consequences of a child with microcephaly or other birth defects. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
Zika virus has recently spread throughout the Americas. Although _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes are considered the primary vector, _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and mosquitoes of other species may also be vectors. We tested _Cx quinquefasciatus _ and _Ae taeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes from the US Gulf Coast; both were refractory to [Zika virus] infection and incapable of transmission.

[This is yet another report indicating that _Culex quinquefasciatus_ mosquitoes are refractory to Zika virus infection. There is one previous report from China indicating that this species of mosquito is a competent vector. Several studies done in North America do not support that observation. - Mod.TY]

Abstract
--------
Despite great attention given to the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas, much remains unknown about its epidemiology and evolution, in part due to a lack of genomic data. We applied multiple sequencing approaches to generate 100 ZIKV genomes from clinical and mosquito samples from 10 countries and territories, greatly expanding the observed viral genetic diversity from this outbreak. We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions, confirming phylogenetic evidence for the origin and rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil, and for multiple introductions from Brazil into Honduras, Colombia, Puerto Rico, other Caribbean islands, and the continental US. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in many regions of the Americas for up to a year before the 1st locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the challenge of effective surveillance for this virus. We further characterize genetic variation across the outbreak to identify mutations with possible functional implications for ZIKV biology and pathogenesis.
