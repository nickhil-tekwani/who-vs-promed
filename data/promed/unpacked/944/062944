State vet warns against cattle disease
-----------------------------------------
A livestock disease that causes mouth blisters has appeared in Montana and
Wyoming, and ranchers may not bring animals into North Dakota from those
states without a health inspection, the state veterinarian said.
The viral illness, called vesicular stomatitis, or VS for short, mostly
affects cattle, horses and hogs. It can cause sores and lesions on an
animal's mouth, nostrils and hooves. It can cause animals to lose weight,
because the sores inhibit eating.
North Dakota has not had a confirmed case of the illness since 1995, Keller
said. 16 cases recently reported in Montana were the 1st in the state since
1982. It resembles foot-and-mouth disease, which is much more serious.
"Until we have a killing frost, we strongly advise North Dakota producers
to avoid moving animals to or from Montana, or any state with confirmed
cases of VS," Keller said on Monday [22 Aug 2005].

[The vesicular stomatitis virus in Montana has been typed as the New Jersey
strain. It is quite possible that the same strain is in Wyoming.
VSV presents clinically in a very similar way to Foot and Mouth disease,
with blisters and vesicles in the mouth, on the coronary bands and between
the digits. However, VSV can and does affect horses, while FMD does not. -
