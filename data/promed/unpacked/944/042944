Typhoid in Westmoreland
--------------------------------
The Western Regional Health Authority is trying to track down the
original carrier of the latest case of typhoid fever to hit
Westmoreland, leaving a small child, his 15-year-old mother, and
another 37-year-old female in the same household infected. In
addition to the 3 confirmed cases, 2 other persons suspected of
having the disease have been hospitalized.

According to epidemiologist for the Western Regional Health
Authority Dr Janice Alexander, while other members of the
household and family are being investigated, public health officials
are actively searching for the original carrier of the disease, as
they are not convinced that any one of the infected persons is the
original carriers.

The 1-year-old child was the first to be confirmed with typhoid after
presenting symptoms of gastroenteritis, which is also on the rise in
the western end of the island.

Dr Alexander noted that care has to be taken that the infected
persons do not pass on the bacteria in their stool, and that there is
proper disposal of excreta. "The environmental aspect continues at
the same time, so the public health inspectors are making sure that
the water quality, sanitation, and excreta disposal (are in order),"
she said.

Health officials, cognisant of the 1995 typhoid outbreak along the St
James/Westmoreland border, which resulted in a number of
fatalities, are usually on the alert for any early signs of the disease
and have a general plan on how to deal with any cases reported.
The infection is usually found in areas where there are ineffective
sewage disposal systems.

Yesterday, councillor for the North Savanna-la-mar division, Devon
Thomas, said the area in which the disease was detected this time
recently had a number of toilets demolished by the Ministry of
Water and Housing during infrastructural upgrading work. He said
that while some of the residents had their toilets restored, others
had not.

[Typhoid, human infection with _S. typhi_, unlike most
salmonelloses, is not a zoonosis, but is spread from person to
person, usually through contaminated food or water. The finding of
several members of the same family with the infection suggests a
common food or water source, or even the possibility of a food
preparer with chronic carriage -- the "Typhoid Mary" scenario. -
