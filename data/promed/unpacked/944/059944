A 12th Case of West Nile Virus Infection Reported in New York
-------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK: A Staten Island man has become the 12th city resident this year to
become infected with the West Nile virus. The 52-year-old man, whose
identity was not released, apparently became infected in mid-August but
tried to fight off symptoms including joint and muscle pain, fever and
dizziness. After he entered a hospital on Tue 19 Sep 2000, doctors diagnosed
the virus. The man remains lethargic but is listed in stable condition, New
York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said. The mayor said 8 of the 12 people
diagnosed with the disease continue to recover at home, while 4 remain
hospitalized. All appear stable.
Giuliani said the city will continue spraying city neighborhoods with
pesticides to control the virus until at least mid-October, when freezing
temperatures should wipe out most mosquitoes. Environmental groups have
filed a federal lawsuit to force the city to stop spraying, saying the
pesticides are potentially more harmful to people than the disease. The
judge presiding over the case, though, has already indicated that the
several hundred complaints about the spraying to a city health hot line may
not carry as much weight as the 4 [7 overall deaths blamed on the disease
last year.
