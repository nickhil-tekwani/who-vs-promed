Saudi bans hajj camel slaughter


Saudi Arabia on Friday [11 Sep 2015] banned the slaughter of camels during this year's hajj pilgrimage, after a surge in deaths from the MERS virus linked to the animals.

Camels will not be allowed to enter the holy sites of Mecca and Medina, the Permanent Committee for Fatwa said in a statement carried by the official Saudi Press Agency.

Hundreds of thousands of faithful from around the world have begun to gather for the annual hajj, which is expected to begin on 21 Sep 2015.

"The Permanent Committee for Fatwa stressed no slaughter of the camels inside the holy sites due to emergence of coronavirus," the committee said.

Only sheep and cows will be allowed.

As part of the hajj rituals, pilgrims traditionally slaughter animals and give the meat to the needy.

The World Health Organization has cited the preliminary results of studies indicating that people working with camels are at increased risk of infection from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Saudi Arabia is the worst-affected of more than 20 countries where MERS has appeared.

The Ministry of Health on Friday [11 Sep 2015] reported 3 new cases, bringing to 1231 the number of infections since MERS was 1st identified in the Kingdom in 2012.

There have been 521 deaths, including 19 in one week during late August [2015].

[As reported in posting 20150823.3597358, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health spokesman Khaled Al-Mirghalani told Arab News on Friday, 21 Aug 2015, that his ministry was discussing, with officials from the Makkah governorate and its municipality, banning the slaughter of camels during Hajj rituals during the due Hajj event. "Once the 3 parties agree, the ban will be formally announced in the coming weeks ahead of Hajj," he said. It seems that the envisaged agreement between the relevant agencies has been reached. - Mod.AS
