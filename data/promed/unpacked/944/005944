Mosquito surveillance efforts in Windsor-Essex [Ontario, Canada] have detected a tropical invasive mosquito that can potentially spread the Zika virus.

The mosquito, known as _Aedes albopictus_, was found within Windsor city limits, according to the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit [WECHU], which carries out mosquito surveillance.

The mosquito is capable of transmitting the Zika virus, but it's not likely to be the main spreader of the infection, since it feeds on animals in addition to people, according to the health unit.

"There is no change in risk for Zika virus in our community and the _Ae. albopictus_ mosquito found tested negative for Zika virus and West Nile virus," medical officer of health Dr Wajid Ahmed said in a news release on Monday [28 Jun 2021].

"This is an important reminder for everyone to remove standing water around our homes and workplaces to prevent mosquito breeding and protect ourselves and our families from mosquito bites."

The mosquito typically lays eggs in standing water as opposed to ponds, according to the health unit.

"_Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes are aggressive daytime biters, with peaks in activity in the early morning and late afternoon," WECHU said.

The mosquito was first detected in Windsor-Essex in 2016 and has also been found in Ottawa, Toronto, and Peel region, as well as in the USA.

[The report above indicates that this mosquito was first found in the area in 2016. At that time Dr Gary Kirk, medical officer of health, said, "The finding of these mosquitoes 3 times in the last 4 weeks may mean that the species has established a breeding ground around the trap." Interestingly, in the intervening 5 years, there have been no further reports of _Aedes albopictus_ being trapped in the area. However, _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes were captured there in 2017 and 2019.

_Ae. aegypti_ does not enter into diapause in the fall so cannot survive the Ontario winter. _Ae. albopictus _ can, although in the report above no mention of captures were reported during the 1917-1920 interval. It will be interesting to see if this mosquito is found in the Windsor-Essex area next year (2022) and beyond. - Mod.TY
