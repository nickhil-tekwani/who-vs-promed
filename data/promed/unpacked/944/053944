[Following the recent bovine tuberculosis case in a UK Alpaca breeder, we have approached Dr DF Twomey, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency-Exeter, Devon, UK, requesting his view of the case and some background. The following response, kindly forwarded by him, is gratefully acknowledged and much appreciated. - Mod.AS]

I have been involved with several investigations into TB in camelids but didn't have any direct involvement with the recently reported case of TB in a person who had contact with an infected alpaca. The following link provides further details, presumably about the same case: http://www.alpacatb.com/news.html.

This person was at an unusually high risk of exposure to _Mycobacterium bovis_ by virtue of her work with infected alpacas. All animals infected with _M. bovis_ constitute a potential source of the bacterium for humans and tuberculous alpacas are no exception. 'Native' cases of zoonotic TB infection, although very rare in developed countries, can happen occasionally. This particular case does not alter the fact that there is a very low risk of zoonotic TB infection in the UK.

Although _M. bovis_ was first diagnosed in camelids in GB in 1999, this is only the 2nd documented case of human infection associated with contact with tuberculous llamas or alpacas since then. The other incident was also attributed to occupational exposure to an infected alpaca in GB and occurred in 2004-05 after a veterinary surgeon treating and sampling an alpaca that died of TB subsequently contracted a cutaneous form of _M. bovis_ infection. The case was later published: Twomey DF, Higgins RJ, Worth DR, et al: Cutaneous TB caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_ in a veterinary surgeon following exposure to a tuberculous alpaca (_Vicugna pacos_). Vet Rec 2010. 166(6): 175-7 [abstract available at http://veterinaryrecord.bmj.com/content/166/6/175.extract].

[According to a 2006 review (see reference below), in the period 1990-2003, between 17 and 50 new cases of human _M. bovis_ infection were confirmed every year in the UK. This represented between 0.5 and 1.5 percent of all the culture-confirmed TB cases, a proportion similar to that of other industrialized countries. Most cases of zoonotic TB diagnosed in the UK were, at that point in time, attributed to (i) reactivation of long-standing latent infections acquired before widespread adoption of milk pasteurization, or (ii) _M. bovis_ infections contracted abroad. Throughout the said 14-year period, only one case was documented in the UK of confirmed, indigenous human _M. bovis_ infection recently acquired from an animal source.

In view of the increased incidence of bovine TB in cattle and other animals, the number of human cases is expected to rise.

The reviewer concluded:
"A significant risk of _M. bovis_ infection remains in certain segments of the UK population in the form of (i) continuing on-farm consumption of unpasteurized cows' milk, (ii) retail sales by approved establishments of unpasteurized milk and dairy products, and (iii) occupational exposure to infectious aerosols from tuberculous animals and their carcases."

"Physicians and other public health professionals must remember that zoonotic TB is not just a disease of the past."

[Conventional microbiologic diagnosis of human tuberculosis relies on methods that allow only identification of “Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex”. “M. tuberculosis complex” is composed of _ Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (Mtb), as well as _Mycobacterium bovis_ (Mb) and several other genetically closely related species: the BCG bacillus, _M. africanum_, _M. caprae_, _M. microti_, and M. canetti. Mb is inherently resistant to pyrazinamide (PZA), a drug that is an essential component of the standard multidrug short-course regimen to treat human tuberculosis due to drug-susceptible Mtb. Differentiation of Mb from Mtb is therefore important clinically as well as epidemiologically. To distinguish Mb from these other species, special tests would have to be done, such as spoligotyping (spacer oligonucleotide typing), which is a polymerase chain reaction-based amplification of a region of the mycobacterial genome, or growth in selective media and specific biochemical reactions. If these special tests are not done, the diagnosis of Mb infection might be missed and the patient treated inappropriately. - ModML]
