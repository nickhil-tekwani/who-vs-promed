The Lewis and Clark City-County [Montana] Health Department announced Tuesday [22 Apr 2014] that 7 cases of pertussis, or whooping cough, have been identified in the Helena area in the past 2 weeks. Most of the confirmed cases have involved teenagers. The health department is contacting people who have been exposed to the disease in an effort to keep it from spreading.

Pertussis is a serious respiratory illness that can spread through close and prolonged person-to-person contact. People with pertussis can have symptoms ranging from runny nose and intermittent cough to severe uncontrollable coughing that can last for months. Pertussis is common in the United States, and there are frequent outbreaks, but it can cause serious illness and can even be life threatening, especially in infants.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend using antibiotics to treat those in close, prolonged contact with someone who is sick with pertussis. Antibiotics work best when given early in the course of the disease.

"Another way to help protect our community is to get vaccinated," said Karen Dobson Wandel, public health nurse supervisor at the health department. "5th and 6th graders who haven't had their pertussis booster yet should get it now. Adults, especially those who live and work with infants, should be sure they're up to date. Protection from the regular series of childhood shots wanes over time."

Women also should be vaccinated during each pregnancy. The best time is during the 27th through 36th week, according to the CDC. Some of the protective antibodies in the vaccine will be passed to the infant, giving it short-term protection against pertussis until it's old enough to be vaccinated itself. [This statement is not exactly correct. The vaccine does not contain antibodies. Please see the moderator's comments below.]

The health department offers tetanus boosters that contain pertussis during regular walk-in immunization clinics Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 11 am to 4:30 pm at 1930 Ninth Ave. However, there will be no immunization clinic on Wed 23 Apr 2014 due to staff training.

For more information, contact your health-care provider or the Lewis and Clark City-County Health Department, 443-2584, or visit the CDC website at http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis.

Long Beach [California] health officials are warning residents of a sharp increase in whooping cough cases in the city. Health officials say 42 cases have been reported since January [2014]. Although officials did not immediately have a breakdown for the cases reported in the same period last year, they said 15 cases were reported for all of 2013. 4 cases were reported in 2012.

This year [2014], most of the infected have been school-age children, officials said, adding that no deaths have been reported. "A recent rise in pertussis in the city of Long Beach serves as a reminder that all age groups need to be properly immunized against this highly contagious disease," said Dr Mitchell Kushner, health officer for the Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services.

Symptoms start with a cough, low-grade fever, and runny nose that will last up to 2 weeks, followed by rapid coughing fits that can sometimes last months. Typical symptoms in young infants may be more variable and severe, including intense coughing accompanied by a whooping sound and vomiting after coughing. Officials say complications, such as pneumonia and seizures, and in rare cases, death, can occur.

Although most children receive 5 doses of pertussis vaccine before entering kindergarten, immunization wears off over time and booster shots are needed throughout life. Health officials are encouraging residents to contact their healthcare providers and immunize themselves and their families against the disease.

Those who do not have a regular health provider or health insurance can dial 211 or the health department's immunization program at (562) 570-4516.

[Pertussis has been on the increase throughout most of the world. This has been attributed in part to increased virulence and other genetic changes in the circulating clones of _Bordetella pertussis_, as well as waning or an ineffective immune response after vaccination. For a discussion of these problems, see moderator LL's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on pertussis.

The incidence rate of pertussis among infants exceeds that of all other age groups, and the majority of deaths continue to occur among infants younger than 3 months of age. Because much of the morbidity and mortality from pertussis are in infants less than one year of age, especially less than 6 months, who are not as yet protected by active immunization, the CDC recommends "cocooning," a vaccination strategy that aims to protect infants from becoming infected with pertussis before the baby's whooping cough vaccinations start at 2 months of age, by vaccinating individuals, such as the mother and other caregivers, who would come into regular contact with the newborn infant.

In response to her pertussis vaccination, a pregnant woman will produce protective antibodies, which are passed transplacentally to her baby before birth. These antibodies provide the baby short-term protection against whooping cough in early life. Protective antibodies are at their highest about 2 weeks after getting the vaccine. So vaccination should be scheduled late in pregnancy, preferably during the 27th through 36th week, to give the baby the most protection when born and vaccination should be repeated with each pregnancy so high levels of protective antibodies are transferred to each of the babies.

Pregnant women should receive Tdap [combined tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines, with a reduced dose of the diphtheria and pertussis vaccines], the type of pertussis vaccine for those 11 years and older, including pregnant women. Women who did not receive the vaccine during pregnancy should get it immediately after giving birth. Fathers, grandparents, and others 11 years and older who have close contact with the baby should also get a dose if they have not had the booster.

DTaP is the type of pertussis vaccine used for children 2 months through 6 years of age. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years. Both the Tdap and DTaP vaccines combine protection against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria (see http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/pregnant/whooping-cough/get-vaccinated.html). - Mod.ML]
