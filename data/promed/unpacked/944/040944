Central Java health authorities are quickly taking steps to avert a
dengue fever epidemic after six children died and another 140 have been
treated for the potentially deadly illness in the last four weeks. The
six deaths occurred in Demak regency and greater Semarang area.
Hadi Wibowo, head of the Semarang health office said Thursday many
people had been admitted to hospital in the last week and the number is
expected to rise next month. He said the government had begun
fumigation [insecticide] in several locations but admitted that the
scope of the effort was severely limited by the administration's budget.
"That's why the active participation of the community at large is
crucial to stop the spread of the disease," Hadi remarked.
