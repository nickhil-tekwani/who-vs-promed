Varroa, a parasitic mite of honey bees and unknown in Britain until it
crossed from the Continent in 1992, has devastated bee colonies in England
and Wales and is now threatening Scotland. Having already wiped out huge
numbers of bees as it swept its way through thousands of hives across
England and Wales, it is now poised to inflict similar chaos in Scotland.
The mite has established an expanding foothold in the western Scottish
borders and has also crossed to the Republic of Ireland. The pest crossed
into Scotland late last year. Since then it has established itself in
Dumfries and Galloway and parts of Roxburghshire. Adrian Waring, general
secretary of the British Beekeepers' Association said yesterday: "Incidence
in the UK is continuing to increase. Doing nothing is not an option." He
was speaking at the launch of National Varroa Week, designed to make
Britain's 30,000 beekeepers more aware of the dangers of varroa and ways of
guarding their hives against it.
The parasite has totally defeated efforts to halt its invasion. It has
proved so aggressive that the UK Ministry of Agriculture abandoned efforts
to eradicate it within months of its arrival. It now seems as though it is
here to stay and all that beekeepers can do is try to minimise the damage,
most experts believe. Varroa kills some bees, but weakens others. This in
turn weakens the colonies, making them more susceptible to other diseases
and pests.
Beekeepers have been urged to sift through the debris on the floors of
their hives for signs of the mite. If varroa is found the hive can be
treated with strips impregnated with Bayvarol hung between the honeycombs.

_Varroa jacobsoni_ is a serious parasite of bees. It is a very tiny
parasite. The parasite feeds from the bees blood after attaching itself
firmly to the body. A large shield-like hard casing protects the Varroa's
vulnerable underside. Once attached, the parasite is virtually untouchable
within the bee hive environment. _Varroa jacobsoni_ is potentially the most
serious pest ever to threaten world beekeeping. Reports from other areas
where the mite has been introduced show that great losses of colonies have
occurred. The same has been true in the United States.
It is important to ensure that Varroa is not confused with the honey bee
tracheal mite (_Acarapis woodi_). There has been and continues to be a
great deal of controversy about the latter mite which lives in the
breathing tubes of bees. The tracheal mite is difficult to find and the
damage it inflicts on colonies is a matter of great debate. The Varroa mite
should also not be confused with the bee louse, _Braula coeca_, which has
six legs that extend from the body.
The Varroa mite, by contrast, is an external parasite of the honey bee. It
is visible to the naked eye, reddish brown with a characteristic oval shape
and has eight legs tucked under a shell.
Once inside the hive, other bees are quickly affected. Blood loss leads to
lethargy, and with a decline in worker bees collecting pollen, the honey
output declines. The hive itself can be completely wiped out in some cases
within a few months.
Russian and European experiences reveal an infestation is usually fatal to
colonies of European bees (_Apis mellifera_) within three to seven years.
Low levels of infestation are extremely difficult to detect.
It is a 7-10 year process to get chemicals registered, a process often
costing millions of dollars. Many of the 140 or so chemicals used worldwide
for Varroa mite control are toxic to bees and beekeepers and their use
risks contamination of honey and wax. The Varroa mite develops resistance
to chemicals in a short time. This is especially true when the chemicals
are not used properly and/or dosage rates have not been adequately
investigated.
