Cholera epidemic kills 50 in southwest Nigeria
-----------------------------------------------
At least 50 people have been killed and over 300 others still critically
ill in hospitals following a cholera epidemic in southwest Nigeria,
according to the Punch newspaper Fri, 12 Nov 2004.
Already, residents have in hundreds started fleeing Owan West local
government area in northwestern Edo state where the cholera epidemic
occurred, raising fears that such mass movement may cause a spread of the
waterborne disease in the neighboring towns.
Godwin Ovbiagele, health commissioner of the state, has dispatched 20
additional doctors and other medical personnel and materials to the
affected area. He also ordered that all patients should be treated free of
charge so that the disease would not spread further.
The outbreak of the deadly disease was first noticed a week earlier, and
it grew into epidemic proportions when the first victims refused to go to
the hospital for treatment, the report said. The epidemic might have been
caused by consumption of contaminated water, it added.
A similar cholera epidemic occurred in the same area in 1974 when hundreds
of people died.

Cholera in Senegal - update
-----------------------------
As of 10 Nov 2004, WHO has received reports from the Ministry of Health of
a total number of 861 cases and 6 deaths in Dakar. In Dakar the incidence
of the disease appears to be decreasing.
In addition to implementing control measures, including health education,
case management and surveillance and monitoring in the affected areas, the
National Outbreak Management Committee has undertaken social mobilization
activities and decontamination of unsanitary areas. Senior government
officials have been active in disseminating health education and hygiene
messages in the mass media.

Senegal: Cholera Outbreak in Bustling Dakar Highlights Africa's Urban Ills
--------------------------------------------------
As its poorer West African neighbors, Guinea and Sierra Leone, grapple with
endemic cholera, Senegal is facing a rare but telling explosion of the
disease in low-income neighborhoods of its busy capital, Dakar. The 1st
cholera epidemic to surface in Senegal in 8 years broke out on 11 Oct 2004
in a crowded, low-income suburb of the capital, highlighting the link
between disease and the poverty across the continent that is associated
with urban decay and rural exodus.
In just under a month, a total of 801 cases had been reported, mainly in
Dakar, including 6 deaths, Dr Bassirou Johnson of the Health Ministry's
epidemiology department told IRIN on Wed, 10 Nov 2004. "I'm very
optimistic that we're over the worst," Johnson said. "We reported 38 new
cases on 9 Nov 2004 compared to 75 daily last week."
Cholera, an acute intestinal infection spread by contaminated water and
food, reached West Africa in 1970 after an absence of more than a century.
It is now endemic in much of the region, notably in Sierra Leone, Burkina
Faso and Cote d'Ivoire. In such countries it is an ongoing hazard of the
rainy season as latrines overflow and wells become polluted in rural and
under-developed areas.
"Cholera is the disease of poverty," Claire-Lise Chaignat, the Geneva-based
coordinator of the WHO's global cholera task force, told IRIN by
telephone. "The outbreak in Senegal could be due to several factors -- the
season, poor food safety, lack of proper hygiene by the population and, I
suppose, the fact that the general environment probably hasn't improved, as
is the case across cholera-latent parts of Africa."
As health authorities disinfected markets, rail and bus stations and public
transport vehicles, tourist-popular Gambia, which is sandwiched between
northern and southern Senegal, anxiously moved to seal its borders against
infection by monitoring hawkers from its neighbor.
Senegal's relatively low fatality rate to date -- less than 1 percent --
indicated the country's capacity to handle medical emergencies, Chaignat
said at WHO headquarters. "They know how to handle the cases, they're
sending out the right control messages, and are keeping people informed,"
she said. "They're also able to cope because the epidemic has broken out in
town, where they have high-density care facilities. That wouldn't
necessarily be the case if an epidemic broke out in the countryside."
In Sierra Leone, health officials reported 633 cases and 56 deaths over Sep
and Oct 2004. Togo on Wed, 10 Nov 2004 reported the first signs of an outbreak.
In Guinea, hit by a severe outbreak that erupted in Jul 2004 in its
capital, Conakry, there had been 1192 cases including 100 deaths by late
Oct 2004, a fatality rate of 8.39 percent.
"That is extremely high," Chaignat said. "When the fatality rate is over 1
percent it means people are not informed or do not have proper access to
care. It can also mean a country lacks the means to deal with the disease,
and needs help."

Cholera Hits More IDPs
----------------------
The cholera epidemic that started from Pabbo IDP [internally displaced
person] camp has spread to Amuru camp, also in Kilak county, with 2 cases
reported. The Pabbo sub-county LC3 chief, Christopher Ojera, on Sun, 7 Nov
2004, said that a 66-year-old died of cholera in Zone C, bringing the death
toll to 3, since the outbreak in Oct 2004.
Ojera said 2 women from Pabbo camp spread the disease to Amuru camp. He
said the task force had put Amuru camp on a cholera alert. They advised
camp residents to maintain hygiene to control the epidemic.
He said there were 123 registered cases of cholera in Pabbo camp and the
situation might worsen.

Cholera Overwhelms Kilembe Hospital
-----------------------------------
Kilembe Hospital in Kasese district does not have enough personnel to
handle both routine work and cholera, which hit the district on Sat, 30 Oct
2004.
The medical superintendent, Dr. Julius Bamwine, on Mon, 1 Nov 2004 said the
number of cholera patients had increased from 26 on Sun, 31 Nov 2004, to
35, with 1 death reported.
"All cases are from Nyakasanga parish of Kasese town council," he said.
Nyakasanga is the most populated area of Kasese town.
The patients were being treated under a tent, which could not accommodate
all the patients. Some of the patients were lying outside the tent but
within the quarantine area.

Outbreak of gastroenteritis in Pangasinan is longest in memory
--------------------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in Pangasinan from May to Oct 2004
was the longest outbreak in recent memory, according to Health Secretary
Manuel Dayrit. Dayrit said an epidemic normally emerges in a certain area
but dies down after 1 or 2 weeks but the outbreak of acute gastroenteritis
in Pangasinan lasted for around 5 months.
Records of the Center for Health Development of the Department of Health
based at the Dagupan City Astrodome showed that there were 8819 acute
gastroenteritis cases that were recorded from 28 May to 22 Oct 2004, of
which 464 were confirmed to be cholera cases.
There were 55 persons who died, the biggest number was registered in
Bolinao at 12; followed by San Carlos City, 9; Malasiqui, 8; Mangaldan, 5;
Alaminos and Bugallon, 4 each; Basista and Mangatarem, 3 each; Bayambang,
2; and 1 each from Dagupan City, Santa Barbara, Aguilar, Balungao and Umingan.
He said the epidemic that happened in Tondo, Manila, occurred in October
and November 2004 only, which was put under control through the
chlorination of water that was distributed to the neighborhood. But the one
that occurred in Pangasinan, according to Dayrit, lasted for 5 months and
emerged as the longest outbreak in the country since the cholera outbreak
in 1948.
There were also cholera cases that were recorded in La Union and a few in
Ilocos Sur, but these were not as widespread as the cholera cases that were
noted in Pangasinan. Eduardo Janairo, the health department's regional
director, said the outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in Pangasinan started
in Malasiqui town when some 300 people were brought at one time to the
Pangasinan Provincial Hospital in San Carlos City.
Noting that this was quite unusual, Janairo sent Dr. Revelyn Cayabyab, a
regional epidemiologist, to Pangasinan to trace where the disease came from
and found that the _Vibrio cholerae_ bacterium may have been spawned by
intake of contaminated water drawn from wells near septic tanks. Janairo
said the epidemic has not stopped yet to date, but it merely took a
downtrend; it is sure to resurge in the next rainy season.
