In his comment regarding a message from Dr. German Roges, Jack Woodall
noted that "a serosurvey after the 1977 epidemic indicated that 42% of the
population had been infected during that time. If Cuba's population then
was 8 million, there must have been around 3.5 million cases, or 7 times
the reported number - Mod.JW". My own experience (dengue 2 virus
epidemic, Puerto Rico, 1969) is that only 50% of people with antibody after
an epidemic of dengue had been ill. That is, the apparent:inapparent
infection rate is 1:1, so that half the people with antibody could not be
considered (clinical) cases, as one cannot have a subclinical "case",
although there are subclinical infections (half of those infected). For
some years I have asked around as to what experience others have had in
such determinations of apparent:inapparent rates but the responses have
been less than satisfying.
In sum, if the data indicate that "42% were infected during the 1977
epidemic" that still does not mean that 42% were sick during that period,
only that 42% were infected. Of course, sick or not sick, infection would
still prime the pump for subsequent risk of DHF. Still, the number of
"cases" (illnesses) reported by the Cuban authorities likely is more nearly
correct than higher estimates made from serosurveys.
Thanks to Dr. Kouri for providing further information [Dengue/DHF - Cuba
(14) regarding ages of DHF/DSS cases.
Finally, regarding my comment mentioning that Dr. Desi Mendoza is still
jailed in Cuba for having inaccurately (or accurately, it doesn't matter to
me) commented on the number of cases of dengue and deaths due thereto, I
must apologize to anyone who thought I was relating the report from Cuba
with the jailing of Dr. Mendoza. The two were scientifically unrelated.
Having been accused by the Cuban Government not only of being a CIA agent
but of starting the 1977 epidemic (accusation not included in my C.V.
because I could never decide whether it belongs between "Family" and
"Baseball Official" or between "Consultant, Pan American Health
Organization, Cuba" and "Building Committee, synagogue"), I am aware as to
how sensitive the issue of dengue is to that Government. My comment about
Dr. Mendoza was only made to take advantage of the opportunity to mention
it without creating a separate posting. Whether Dr. Mendoza intentionally
or unintentionally misinformed anyone is not something I can judge from my
office in Fort Collins. It is clear that the Cuban Government believes it
was intentional; of course, they also say they believe I am or was a CIA
agent and started the 1977 epidemic. As Jack Woodall said, even if Dr.
Mendoza's estimates were incorrect by a factor of seven (or three or
whatever), it is foreign to us to see someone imprisoned for releasing
inaccurate information. Just another Norte Americano peculiarity, I suppose.
Nonetheless, ProMED-mail received the first news of this recent epidemic
not from Cuban Government authorities or from the Pan American Health
Organization. By the time they did admit to the epidemic it was in full
force. Perhaps Dr. Mendoza should be released from prison and given a
medal for having been one of the straws that helped stir the response?
Needless to say, this isn't any of my business.
