An epidemic of Ebola fever has killed 58 people in Watsa, in the eastern province of the
Democratic Republic of Congo, Health Minister Mashako Mamba Saturday announced in Kinshasa.
He said the victims were among the 70 Ebola patients reported in the region, and added that the
epicentre of the oubreak was Faradja, 60 km from the Sundanese border.
The disease is now spreading to the localities of Durba and Watsa - respectively 90 km and 120 km
to the south - and Isiro, more than 200 km southwest of Kinshasa, Mamba said.
He also said that two doctors were handling the patients in Watsa while other medical teams and
local representatives of the WHO and the French charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres were assigned
in the affected regions which are under the control of rebels loyal to the Congolese Democratic
Rally, fighting the government since 2 Aug 1998.
He said Ebola control specialists, who assisted in curbing the epidemics in 1987 and 1995 in
Yambuku and Kikwit, are expected soon in the affected areas.

Dr Stephen Toovey, the director of the independent information service Medinfo, said the DRC
health ministry had reported to the WHO that another 20 people were infected with the deadly
virus. Toovey said there were also indications that the epidemic, which began in the rebel-
controlled northeast of the war-torn DRC, was spreading to the country's border with Sudan. He
said according to health workers in the area people were now succumbing to the virus in Faridje,
some 50km from the Sudanese border. "In this situation that (distance) is very little. There is a very
real danger of it spreading to Sudan," he said.

Ebola-like fever kills 63 in Kabila's Congo
---------------------------------------------------
An Ebola-like haemorrhagic fever has killed at least 63 people in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, health officials said on Monday.
The fever, which causes profuse bleeding like Ebola, surfaced in January near the town of Watsa in
the north east of the country, formerly known as Zaire, near the border with Uganda and Sudan.
A World Health Organisation official in the capital Kinshasa said that it was difficult to give a
reliable toll because of the possibility of double counting but he said that at least 63 sufferers had
died. A team from the Medecins Sans Frontieres medical charity had gone to the region, he added.
The dead in this year's fever outbreak included the doctor who reported and treated the first cases.
He died on 23 Apr 1999 in Isiro, which is in the same Oriental Province as Watsa.
Health Minister Mashako Mamba said on Sunday that reports were coming in of many dead in
remote villages. He spoke of dozens of deaths in a place called Durba. Health officials said that
these were among the 63 deaths reported thus far. Mashako said earlier that more cases and deaths
had been reported in Faradje to the north, which he described as the epicentre of the outbreak.
The cause of the latest outbreak was not immediately clear. Scientists have linked Ebola outbreaks
elsewhere to people who ate or handled monkeys who had died of the disease.
