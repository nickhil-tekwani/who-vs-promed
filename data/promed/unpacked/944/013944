HEMORRHAGIC DISEASE - PAKISTAN (PESHAWAR) (02)

A toxic event originating with the anesthesia equipment seems unlikely, and
any leak of anesthetic gas would be diluted to levels below anesthetic
potency in any operating room.
While there is an obsolete anesthetic gas which can generate phosgene gas
under some conditions when it is used with a carbon dioxide absorber, the
small amount produced has only been reported to affect the patient. (The
gas shall remain unnamed here.)
Even an event like the alleged pesticide ingestion with contamination of
emergency room personnel which occurred in the U.S. a few years ago did not
produce bleeding, but characteristics signs of intoxication.
While anesthetic gases can be lethal in very high concentrations, this has
only been noted with deliberate ingestion (substance abuse). JAMA carried a
report relating to U.S. Navy corpsmen who diverted volatile anesthetics
carried on board ship. (I do not have the exact reference, sorry.)
A prominent, unpleasant odor accompanies even modest concentrations of these
gases, and it is instantly recognized by OR personnel.
Perhaps the speed with which the OR personnel were affected was exagerrated.
On the other hand, and with apologies to my colleagues in ENT, emergency
surgery for the control of bleeding in the airway is frequently accompanied
by the production of droplets and aerosols of blood. Only someone who has
witnessed such cases will appreciate how much and how widely spread it is.
OR masks saturate with moisture and lose their ability to filter organisms
after about an hour. Gowns do little when wet.
And, I must report, many surgeons, especially in settings like endoscopy,
wear their mask below the nose, and so are never protected.
During my anesthesia training I was told that blood should always be treated
as a highly toxic, highly infectious material. Pressed by difficult
circumstances and an emergency, these caregivers may have been unable to
protect themselves adequately.
