A Request for Information
-------------------------
With regard to the ProMED-mail post: "Hepatitis B virus, blood transfusion,
2000 - Japan 20030721.1780", I am a bit confused as to the scenario that
resulted in transmission of hepatitis B virus from a blood donor in Japan.
The donor from whom the virus is thought to have come was said to have "...a
viral load so low it slipped thought the improved Nucleic Acid Test....".
The report seemed to imply that the donor was actually a chronically
infected individual rather than someone in the "window period" of
seroconversion. Further statements indicated that previous to this
incident, window period donations were considered to be the most likely
situation in which donors could slip through the testing system undetected.
Individuals who are chronically infected should also have Hepatitis B Core
antibody, and this test would therefore, detect chronically infected
individuals, even if they had a very low level of virus which was
undetectable by NAT testing. Does anyone know if Hepatitis B Core antibody
was used in this case to test the donor?
