First Report of Canola Blackleg Caused by Pathogenicity Group 4 of
_Leptosphaeria maculans_ in Manitoba.
Y. Chen and W. G. D. Fernando, Department of Plant Science, University of
Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada. Plant Dis. 89:339, 2005; published on-
line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0339B. Accepted for publication 13 Dec 2004.
_Leptosphaeria maculans_ (Desmaz.) Ces. & de Not., causal agent of blackleg
of canola (_Brassica napus_ L.), was initially placed in several
pathogenicity groups (PG) on the basis of the interaction phenotypes (IP) of
_L. maculans_ isolates on the differential canola cvs. Westar (W), Glacier
(G), and Quinta (Q) (4). PG1 isolates are weakly virulent and PG2, PG3, and
PG4 isolates are highly virulent. In Manitoba, the _L. maculans_ population
consists mainly of PG2 isolates (virulent on W and avirulent on G and Q), a
few PG1 isolates (avirulent on W, G, and Q), and PGT (virulent on W and Q,
but avirulent on G) (3).
Since the blackleg fungus is known to have a high level of evolutionary
potential, the Oilseed Pathology Laboratory at the University of Manitoba,
Winnipeg, Canada, examines the pathogenic variability of _L. maculans_
isolates from the Canadian Prairies and North Dakota each year. During 2002,
the presence of PG3 (virulent on W and G and avirulent on Q) was reported in
Manitoba (1). During 2003, a canola field located at La Riviere, Manitoba,
200 km southwest of Winnipeg, was found to be severely affected by blackleg.
Stubble from this field was arbitrarily collected in mid-April 2004, and 98
single-pycnidia pure cultures were obtained by isolating fungi from surface-
sterilized (2 percent sodium hypochlorite), infested residue, cultured on V8
agar at room temperature under cool-white florescent light for 24 h.
Pycnidiospores were harvested after 14 days of incubation using the Miracloth
filtering method (1). PG testing was performed using the three differential
cultivars in the greenhouse. Known PG2, 3, and 4 isolates, 86-12, Liffole-6,
and PL30.2, respectively, were included as positive controls.
For each of the 98 isolates, 12 7-day-old cotyledons of each differential
cultivar grown in Metro Mix were wound-inoculated with 10 microliters of a
pycnidiospore suspension (10 million spores per ml) (1). Inoculated plants
were maintained in the greenhouse (16/21 deg C night/day and a 16-h
photoperiod with cool-white florescent light). The experiment was repeated 3
times. Disease severity on cotyledons was assessed 12 days after inoculation
with a 0 to 9 scale (0 to 2 = resistant; 3 to 6 = intermediate; and 7 to 9 =
susceptible).
Of the 98 isolates tested, 5 were PG1, 51 were PG2, 24 were PG3, 13 were PGT,
and 5 were PG4. The isolates classified as PG4 gave IP reactions of 7 to 9, 7
to 9, and 6.6 to 8.2, on W, G, and Q, respectively. PG3 was reported one year
ago, but highly virulent isolates belonging to PG4 have not been previously
detected in Manitoba.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of the occurrence of PG4 isolates of
_L. maculans_, and the 1st report of PG4 causing canola blackleg in Manitoba.
The appearance of PG4 may be evidence of pathogen population changes
occurring under high-selection-pressure exerted by resistance genes in
commercial cultivars (2), or through importation of PG4 isolates with canola
seed.

[Blackleg in western Canada will continue to change, and new strains will
continue to appear in canola fields. Farmers will have to be prepared to
adapt to new varieties and means of identifying new strains of the pathogen.
The industry's action plan for coping with new disease strains includes
ongoing evaluation of varietal resistance over time, developing a system to
identify new strains, and developing polygenic resistance to the blackleg
pathogen. New strains (PG3 and PGT) were identified in 2003. PG3 has been
confirmed only in Manitoba so far. Most current commercial varieties appear
to have resistance to the new PG strains, but pathologists agreed they can't
yet advise growers which ones may be resistant. Disease management depends
upon planting canola no more than once in 3 years and choosing varieties
rated as resistant or moderately resistant to blackleg. - Mod.DH]
