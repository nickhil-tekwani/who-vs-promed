Hundreds of farmers are in desperation. Cattle contracted an unknown infection. Cattle refused to eat and drink and developed nodules on the body. People have to discard milk and are afraid of their animals dying.

In the village Mahambet [Makhambet], Zelenovskiy [Zelenov] rayon, people have been waiting for a diagnosis for more than one month. Cows became emaciated and have nodules. Infected animals are not allowed entering common pastures; they are kept in backyards and treated there.

People say that medicines they are using for treatment are very expensive. Farmers are not allowed to slaughter their animals.

Veterinarians suspect lumpy skin disease [LSD].

People will be reimbursed only if/when a quarantine is declared. The same situation prevails in the village Bolshoy Chagan, Zelenovskiy rayon, where the disease has already affected some 100 cows.

The chief veterinarian of the Zelenovskiy rayon says: "If animals die, samples will be sent to the lab. At the moment, we do not have a precise diagnosis. Cattle are being treated with antibiotics" [see comment].

A professor at the Western Kazakhstan Agrarian University is sure that the named cattle have LSD.

There is information that meat from infected animals is going to the market; the price is USD 0.6-1.00 per kg.

The Ministry of Agriculture reported that 335 000 cattle had been vaccinated against LSD in the region.

A picture of a diseased cow in Makhambet presenting the typical LSD nodules on the neck is available at http://www.ktk.kz/ru/news/video/2017/08/10/80293.

Samples for laboratory tests could and should have been obtained from suspected (live) cattle in Makhambet, by biopsies from the skin nodules, as early as the nodules were initially observed. The relevant tests are described in OIE's manual: see chapter 2.4.13 "Lumpy skin disease," B. Diagnostic techniques, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf. - Mod.AS]

Farmers in the village Mahamabet, Western Kazakhstan, have not been able to sell meat or milk for 1.5 months. Cattle refused to drink and eat and developed ulcers and nodules. LSD is suspected by specialists, but there is no precise diagnosis.

People can be reimbursed only if a quarantine is declared in the village, and a quarantine can only be declared upon laboratory confirmation.

Farmers are afraid of mass deaths of animals.

[West Kazakhstan is one of the 9 regions in Kazakhstan recognized by the OIE since Aug 2014 as an "FMD-free zone where vaccination is not practiced." This status enables enhanced exports of live animals and their products from the recognized regions, prescribing a strict biosecurity policy within the privileged zone.

Notifying an outbreak of an OIE-listed disease, even before its final confirmation, is one of the elementary requirements from any OIE member country.

According to the current media-based information, LSD virus has been, most likely, circulating in West Kazakhstan for at least a month, remaining undiagnosed. ProMED-mail published the rumors on LSD in Kazakhstan and a request for information on 4 Aug 2017.

Diagnostic efforts should be undertaken at the earliest while prohibiting the movements of animals from the affected premises and region to prevent LSD spreading within the country or beyond (with exported animals or otherwise).

Immediate notification to the OIE is anticipated at the earliest. - Mod.AS
