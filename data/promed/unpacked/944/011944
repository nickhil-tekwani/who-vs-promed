The Shire of Capel [Western Australia] says increased winter rain has
led to the worst mosquito breeding it has ever seen, prompting
concerns of a severe outbreak of Ross River virus in the region.

The shire conducted chemical spraying in wetlands from Dalyellup to
Busselton to prevent the spread of the mosquito-borne virus.

The shire's manager of health services, Colin Dent, says there have
been 3 reported cases so far this year [2009]. "We normally expect to
start getting cases in October or November because that's when the
peak occurs, but this year it's early, which is concerning us," he said.

[ProMED-mail has not reported an outbreak of Ross river virus in
Western Australia since 2004.

Mod.CP provided an excellent summary of the Ross River virus situation
in Australia in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040403.0916:

"Epidemics of benign polyarthritis were recorded in Australia as early
as 1927, and the etiologic agent was isolated in 1963. Ross River
virus was shown to be a mosquito-transmitted virus belonging to the
genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. Ross River virus is
endemic in most coastal regions of Australia and since the 1980's
appears to have extended its geographical range to include most of the
island communities of the South Pacific. The animal reservoir species
are various, and humans exhibit a significant viraemia such that some
epidemics are maintained in a human-mosquito-human transmission cycle.
The mosquito vectors vary according to the local environment.
Fortunately, illness in humans -- although occasionally prolonged and
painful -- is not fatal, and recovery is complete."
