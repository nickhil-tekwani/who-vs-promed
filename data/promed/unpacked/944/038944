The Duval County Health Department (DCHD) has identified a case of
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in a 31-year-old female resident of
Jacksonville with no history of international travel.

Although the risk of ongoing transmission is low as the weather
becomes cooler and drier, the health department would like health
care providers and residents to be aware of additional malaria cases
and requests that any suspect cases be immediately reported to DCHD's
Epidemiology Department at 904-253-1850. An investigation is underway
to determine whether this case of malaria was possibly locally
acquired. The DCHD is working with City of Jacksonville (COJ)
Mosquito Control, the Florida Department of Health (DOH), and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to better understand
where this infection originated.

Florida has reported 111 cases of malaria since the beginning of
2010, all imported from other countries. Duval County has reported 5
imported cases of malaria this year [2010]. The 6th case in Duval
County appears not to be connected to recent travel, making this
possibly the 1st case of locally acquired malaria in the last 10
years for the county.

Tests show that a 31-year-old Jacksonville woman has become infected
with the typically tropical disease [malaria], despite having no
history of international travel, the health department announced.
Bernard Okech, a malaria expert at the University of Florida's
Emerging Pathogens Institute in Gainesville, responded when a
reporter told him the woman had not been outside the country recently.

If further testing confirms it as a locally acquired case, it would
be Duval's 1st in 10 years. A local case would be "very unusual"
because of the region's aggressive mosquito-control efforts and
tendency of people in developed nations to spend most of their time
indoors, Okech said.

Though infected with the most lethal variety of malaria, the woman is
recovering easily, said health department spokesman Charles Griggs.
Health officials routinely decline to release detailed information
about people with reportable diseases, including their identity and
home address, citing federal privacy laws.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is conducting tests to
determine whether the case is of local origin, Griggs said.

This year [2010], there have been 111 cases reported in Florida,
including 5 in Duval. But to date, all have involved people who
traveled to one of the 100 countries where malaria is common.

Health officials warned the public to be on the lookout for more
cases. "Although the risk of ongoing transmission is low as the
weather becomes cooler and drier, the health department would like
health care providers and residents to be aware of additional malaria
cases," the health department said in a written statement.

Any suspected cases should be reported immediately to (904) 253-1850,
officials said. The city's mosquito control department inspected the
area within a half-mile of the woman's house after the agency was
alerted to the possible local case on 18 Nov 2010, said Renee Brust,
a city spokeswoman. Over the following week, inspectors set traps to
collect mosquitoes but collected very few adults and only one that
was capable of carrying malaria.

Most of the areas where water would collect were dry, giving
mosquitoes few places to breed. Inspectors plan to return today [1
Dec 2010] to look for standing water and treat the area if needed, Brust said.

Malaria is caused by a parasite and spread by infected mosquitoes.
Symptoms appear about 10 to 15 days after a mosquito bite and include
fever, headache and vomiting, according to the World Health
Organization. Worldwide, it caused one million deaths in 2008, mostly
among African children.

After biting a human infected with malaria, a mosquito can't pass it
on to another human for at least 2 weeks. That's how long it takes
the parasite to mature inside the mosquito, Okech said. The symptoms
of malaria may sound vague, but the progression of _Plasmodium
falciparum_, the type involved in the Jacksonville case, is
distinctive. The fever and chills hit in evenly spaced 48-hour cycles
as the parasite invades new blood cells, produces offspring and moves
on to infect more cells, Okech said.

[Single cases of malaria in countries without domestic transmission
are not unusual if the climatic conditions are favorable and a local
vector is present. ProMED has reported several cases previously (see
below). These cases most probably are due to asymptomatic gametocyte
carriers infecting the local _Anopheles_ mosquitoes, which transmit
the infection to the case.

Without previous immunity, all infected cases will develop symptoms
and will be diagnosed. The risk that such infections will develop
into a local focus is small. However, an outbreak of falciparum
malaria in Kingston, Jamaica in 2007 has still not been contained
despite Jamaica being free of autochthonous malaria since 1962. - Mod.EP]
