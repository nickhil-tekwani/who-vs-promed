The San Francisco Health Department is warning IV [intra-venous]
drug users they could fall victim to flesh-eating bacteria. In the past
two weeks, 3 people have been diagnosed with the disease...and
one of them has died. Two of the patients had injected black tar
heroin and shared needles. The third injected meth
[methamphetamines] or speed.

[The so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria are generally strains of beta
hemolytic _Streptococcus_ of Group A that have virulence factors that
facilitate rapidly progressive subcutaneous infections. However, see below

According to local media, there were *five* cases as of last weekend, with
two fatalities. All injecting drug users. But one headline implied that the
heroin *itself* may have been the vector for the infections. Is that a
possibility?

Please note that the cases of "flesh eating bacteria" in San Francisco
are due to _Clostridium perfringens_ as opposed to Group A _Streptococcus_.
Unfortunately the media has not distinguished between the two [types of
bacteria].
Although the message to IV drug users is the same -- sharing needles is
not a good idea. [Not to mention that taking drugs is not a good idea -

[Thank you, Joelle, for this important correction. _C. perfringens_ is
commonly associated with food poisoning, but is also associated with
necrotizing enteritis, in which the intestines are destroyed by a toxin
produced by the bacteria - Mod JW]
