Several cases of West Nile virus are now being reported in animals across New York, and local animal owners are being asked to vaccinate their horses. According to the state Department of Agriculture, 5 horses got the disease, including one in Canandaigua. An exact location was not given, but the horse is recovering.

A Monroe County resident died earlier this month from the virus.

Public-health officials say the risk will continue through the 1st heavy frost.

On [Sat 22 Sep 2018], the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported the Ohio Department of Agriculture has confirmed an additional 14 cases of equine West Nile virus (WNV). Officials have now confirmed 31 cases of WNV in Ohio horses so far this year [2018], more than double the number of cases reported last year [2017].

According to the EDCC,
- A 2-year-old Hackney Pony gelding from Trumbull County began exhibiting clinical signs -- including hypersensitivity, ataxia, and a fever -- on 5 Sep 2018. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV but, as of 6 Sep 2018, was alive and recovering;
- A 13-year-old Standardbred gelding from Wayne County started showing clinical signs on 4 Sep 2018; his owner noticed ataxia (incoordination) and a droopy lip. The gelding had not been vaccinated against WNV in 2018. The horse is reportedly alive and recovering;
- A 3-year-old Standardbred mare from Holmes County started showing clinical signs -- including severe ataxia and a droopy lip -- on 4 Sep 2018. She was not vaccinated against WNV. As of 18 Sep 2018, the mare was alive and slowly recovering;
- A 5-year-old Standardbred gelding from Tuscarawas County developed posterior paresis (partial hind-end paralysis) and ataxia on 10 Sep 2018. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV. As of 19 Sep 2018, the horse was alive and recovering;
- A 3-year-old Dutch Harness gelding from Tuscarawas County showed anorexia and posterior paresis. He was not vaccinated against WNV. As of 10 Sep 2018, he was alive and recovering;
- An 8-year-old Percheron mare from Holmes County developed clinical signs -- including severe ataxia, severe muscle fasciculations (twitching), and bilateral hind-limb paresis -- on 7 Sep 2018. The mare was not vaccinated against WNV and was euthanized;
- A 3-year-old Belgian gelding from Coshocton County started showing ataxia on 8 Sep 2018, which progressed to muscle tremors, incoordination, and proprioceptive deficits (lack of physical awareness of limbs and their placement) in all legs. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV but was recovering as of 17 Sep 2018;
- A horse from Ashtabula County began showing clinical signs on 3 Sep 2018; the owner 1st noticed that the horse had trouble standing. A veterinarian examined the horse and noticed it was ataxic, had proprioceptive deficits in all legs, facial muscle fasciculations, a heart rate of 36 beats per minute, and a fever of 101.6 deg F/38.7 deg C. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV. As of 17 Sep 2018, the horse was reported to be recovering;
- A 10-year-old Standardbred mare from Wayne County started exhibiting clinical signs on 11 Sep 2018 and was brought to a clinic because she was laterally recumbent, unable to rise, and had minimal movement in the forelimbs, which progressed to a loss of hind-limb function. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV and was euthanized on 15 Sep 2018;
- A 10-year-old Paint gelding from Tuscarawas County presented with ataxia. He went down but rose when a veterinarian went to examine him. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV and was euthanized;
- An adult Belgian gelding from Holmes County started showing signs on 8 Sep 2018. A veterinarian was called because the owner noted the horse walking in circles. Upon the vet's arrival, the horse was unable to rise and would continuously fall. He had posterior paresis and was down later that day. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV but was reportedly recovering as of 19 Sep 2018;
- A 4-year-old Morgan gelding from Holmes County started showing clinical signs on 9 Sep 2018. The veterinarian was called out to examine the "wobbly horse" and, upon arrival, the horse was down. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV and was euthanized;
- A 6-year-old Standardbred gelding from Wayne County started showing clinical signs on 4 Sep 2018 when the owner 1st noticed he had a droopy lip. Two days later the clinical signs progressed to full-body tremors and localized muscle fasciculations, front-limb paresis, and lateral recumbency. The horse was not vaccinated against WNV. The horse is alive and recovering as of 14 Sep 2018; and
- A 7-year-old mollie mule from Tuscarawas County started showing clinical signs on 1 Sep 2018. The owner was trying to load the mule onto a trailer; the mule got off the trailer and was agitated and hypersensitive. The mule began running down the road, collapsed, and died suddenly. She was not vaccinated against WNV.

In 2017, officials confirmed 14 cases of WNV in Ohio horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [Wed 26 Sep 2018] that the Iowa state veterinarian has confirmed 2 new equine West Nile virus (WNV) cases. There have been 10 confirmed cases of WNV in Iowa horses so far this year [2018], according to EDCC data.

"On 20 Sep 2018, an 18-year-old Belgian gelding in Clinton County had facial and chest muscle fasciculation (twitching), stiffness in the legs, muscle weakness in the hind limbs, ataxia (incoordination), and mild fever," the EDCC said.

Meanwhile, "a 3-year-old Quarter Horse mare in Wapello County was examined on 23 Sep 2018," the EDCC said. "The horse 1st developed posterior paresis on 22 Sep 2018 and progressed to being recumbent the next day. The horse was treated symptomatically, examined the following day [23 Sep 2018], and the owner elected to humanely euthanize on 24 Sep 2018. This mare was not vaccinated for WNV this year [2018] and had no previous history of WNV vaccination."

Last year [2017] there were 2 confirmed cases of WNV in Iowa horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

Another Kentucky horse has tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), E.S. Rusty Ford, equine operations consultant for the Kentucky State Veterinarian's Office, said in a statement Thu 27 Sep 2018. There are now 7 confirmed cases of WNV in Kentucky horses this year [2018].

The affected 5-year-old Thoroughbred mare from Woodford County developed clinical signs on 18 Sep 2018. She exhibited facial muscle fasciculation (twitching), hypermetria (a condition in which voluntary muscular movement overreaches the intended goal), profuse sweating throughout the body, hyperexcitability, and progressive ataxia in all 4 limbs, Ford said. The mare was euthanized.

Ford said the mare was "reported as being current with annual vaccination (and) was last vaccinated January 2018."

In 2017, animal-health officials confirmed 15 cases of WNV in Kentucky horses, according to USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service data.

WNV 101
West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit
- Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation;
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia.

WNV has no cure, but some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3-6-week period. It takes several weeks for horses to develop protection against the disease following complete vaccination or booster administration.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by
- Removing stagnant water sources;
- Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- Keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

A case of West Nile virus (WNV) was confirmed in a horse in Marion County in the past few weeks.

Veterinarians in Marion and Hillsboro said they had not seen any cases, but Hillsboro Veterinary Clinic said one man had talked about his horse showing WNV signs and had taken his horse to a clinic in Wichita. Equine Surgery and Medicine in Wichita confirmed it had diagnosed a horse that was from the Durham area.

The disease affects the spinal column and brain. Signs of West Nile infection in horses include fever, weakness of hind limbs, impaired vision, aimless wandering, and convulsions.

Horses contract the virus exclusively from mosquitoes that previously fed on an infected bird. The virus cannot be passed from horse to horse or horse to human. A vaccine is available that is "highly effective," according to Kansas Department of Agriculture.

Jessica Laurin, veterinarian at Animal Health Center in Marion, has treated West Nile cases in horses in the past. She said when cases 1st showed up in Kansas, there was no vaccine. The clinic provided supportive care. This included intravenous injections and anti-inflammatory medications.

Recovery is a slow process, taking 3 or 4 weeks, after which the horse is unable to work for 4-6 months.

"It's important that people vaccinate their horses," Lauren said. "The vaccine they came out with cuts down on the number of cases. The recent cases found in Kansas were in unvaccinated horses."

Late summer and early fall are peak times for WNV. People can minimize the risk of infection by having their horses vaccinated and keeping them healthy with proper nutrition. They can reduce mosquito populations by eliminating shallow standing water and turning over unused containers.

WNV is a reportable disease in Kansas, which means veterinarians are required by law to report any confirmed cases to the state veterinarian. Cases were also reported in Lyon, Seward, Neosho, and Wichita counties.

[How tragic to have so many horses affected and/or euthanized/dead because of a preventable disease! West Nile virus is preventable with a vaccine. The vaccine is usually combined with eastern equine encephalitis and western equine encephalitis and often tetanus. Therefore, a lot of protection for the horse for a very small amount of money. So why are people still not vaccinating? Responsibility for having an animal as a working animal or as a companion, regardless of size, means taking the responsibility of protecting the animal. - Mod.TG
