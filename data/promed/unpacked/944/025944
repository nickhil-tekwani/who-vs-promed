[The OIE Disease Status report of 26 Jun 1998 includes this follow-up report.
Epidemiological status:
The disease continues to be limited to the four establishments in and
around the Federal Capital where it began. The ban on the entry and
departure of horses imposed on these establishments is being maintained.
The morbidity rate registered was between 20% and 30% in the two
establishments in the Federal Capital, and one single case out of 80 horses
and four cases out of 50 horses in the other two establishments,
respectively.
The two deaths registered in only one of the clubs, out of 65 sick animals,
were not related to this problem. No new cases have emerged since 11 May
1998 in three of the four establishments, with the same trend being found
in the remaining club since that date. In all of the cases, the course of
the disease is favourable, with complete remission of the symptoms in most
of the affected animals.
According to reports from SENASA personnel received from throughout the
national territory, and from neighbouring countries which have had horses
in transit through the Argentine Republic in the past 30 days, no similar
symptomatology has been identified. In view of the above, Official
Resolution No. 667 of 11 June 1998 lifted the restrictions on transit and
equestrian activities, implemented on 5 June 1998, with equestrian events
being authorised under the control of official veterinarians and a state of
alert and vigilance being maintained. Likewise, import and export
operations are now authorised.
Diagnostic advances:
The diagnostic laboratory tests carried out to date do not indicate any
link between the episode and the following diseases: vesicular stomatitis
(Indiana and New Jersey strains), African horse sickness, glanders,
dourine, piroplasmosis, equine viral arteritis, equine adenovirus and
equine rhinopneumonitis (HVE-1).
Other investigations in progress: The lines of investigation being pursued
include microbiology and toxicology.

[For those who might have forgotten the original complaint ... "Clinical
manifestations: edema and/or inflammation of the lips, with asymmetry of
lips and nostrils, nasal erosions and secretion, erosive lesions of 2 to 5
mm in the mouth (palate, cheeks, gums, interior of lips and upper and
lateral surfaces of the tongue). The signs observed are anal and genital
erosions, inflammation and secretions. Some animals present a short period
of slight hyperthermia. A possible non-infectious etiology should not be
ruled out." - Mod.MHJ
