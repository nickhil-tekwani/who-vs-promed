O157 food poisoning is spreading widely in Japan.

A total of 12 prefectures reported O157.
The source of the infection is not proved yet.
Health officials in HIROSHIMA and OKAYAMA indicated to all school lunch
supply centers to prolong the lunch sample reserve period from 3 days to 7
days, because the O157 incubation period is longer than 3 days.

On June 22, The Japan Times (English newspaper) reported the following:
***
More incidents of food poisoning are discovered.
More cases of food poisoning caused by the O157 colon bacillus have been
found in various parts of Japan, health officials said Friday.
Four people were found to have been attacked by the food poisoning in
TOKYO, and two more in KOBE. They are the first cases in these areas.

TOKYO: the cases are a 2-year-old girl, a 3-year-old boy, a 4-year-old boy
and a 74-year-old woman. The 2-year-old girl was reported in serious
condition. Tokyo health officials said the sources of the food poisoning
have not yet been pinpointed.
KOBE: the cases are two 7-year-old boys, who were treated at the same
hospital. Doctors found the O157 bacillus in both. They are not from the
same area, and there is no danger of a mass outbreak of food poisoning,
health officials said.
NAGOYA: one of the two elementary schoolchildren treated at Nagoya No. 2 Red
Cross Hospital died of food poisoning June 8, health officials there said.
The 7-year-old boy who died is the third person known to have died in the
current outbreak of food poisoning from the same bacillus.
SAPPORO: health officials said that an 8-year-old elementary school student
died of food poisoning caused by O157 in October 1995. The city's health
officials said two brothers of the boy -- a 9-year-old elementary school
student and a 4-year-old attending a nursery -- also showed similar symptoms
from May 23. Tests did not reveal the presence of the O157 bacillus, but
when blood samples were forwarded to a national children's hospital in
Tokyo, the boy's illness was diagnosed as food poisoning due to the bacillus.
