Deer hit by outbreak of pinkeye
-----------------------------------
An outbreak of conjunctivitis in deer herds in northwest Colorado and
around the Paonia area has resulted in nearly 100 deer being killed by the
Colorado Division of Wildlife.
Conjunctivitis, commonly known as pinkeye, is a highly infectious disease
found occasionally in wildlife, domestic livestock and humans. However, in
the latter 2 species, the disease can be spotted early and treated
successfully. When pinkeye hits wildlife, however, it's often not noticed
until it's too advanced to treat.
"This time of year, the deer are typically concentrated in remote areas
where people can't see them," said Bill deVergie, Meeker area manager for
the Division of Wildlife. "We really don't know how widespread it is in
those areas we are experiencing it."
Field officers have humanely killed more than 75 conjunctivitis-infected
deer this winter [2006], 80 percent of them young bucks, deVergie said. "We
are predominantly seeing it in young bucks, although we have had a few does
and a calf elk," deVergie said. "By the time we get a report about a deer
stumbling around, it's too late to save it."
Approximately 20 deer in the Paonia area have been killed this year [2006]
because of advanced conjunctivitis, DOW spokesman Joe Lewandowski said.
It's unknown how many deer die unreported from the results of conjunctivitis.
According to the Web site Kidshealth.org, conjunctivitis is an inflammation
of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane covering the white part of the eye
and lining the inner surface of the eyelids. While the inflammation can
have many causes, it poses no threat to vision if it's treated in its early
stages.
"We see cases of conjunctivitis in deer every year," said DOW state
veterinarian Mike Miller of Fort Collins. "It's not something we've never
seen before. In young males, it usually flares up around breeding season."
Young bucks spend a lot of time sparring and butting heads in mock battle,
and that contact helps spread the disease, Miller said. He said the exact
cause of the outbreak is nearly impossible to determine. "One of the
problems we have is by the time the infected animals are seen, they've been
infected for quite some time, and it's difficult to pinpoint the cause," he
said.
In its advanced stages, conjunctivitis could lead to blindness and possibly
rupturing of the cornea, Miller said. Disturbed eyesight would make it
easier for a deer to be killed by a predator, hit by a vehicle or unable to
feed. The Division of Wildlife is reluctant to feed wildlife in the winter,
citing the spread of diseases such as conjunctivitis in closely bunched
animals.
The recent outbreak in northwest Colorado is one of the worst deVergie or
his field officers could recall, he said. "It's surprising. We've seen it
in the past, but, by far, this is the worst we've seen in some years,"
deVergie said. "We've been told it can be cyclical, but we don't know what
kind of cycle it runs. Is it one year, 10 years, 40 years?"
He said the carcasses of infected animals are either burned in the DOW's
incinerator in Craig, the same one used to destroy animal heads tested for
chronic wasting disease, or buried in a landfill.
Miller said this year's [2006] outbreak won't have long-lasting effects on
the deer populations. "While it may have minor impacts in local areas, I
can't imagine it having a big impact overall," he said. "Remember, 75 deer
out of the White River herd isn't very many, a drop in the bucket." The
White River deer herd is estimated at approximately 140 000 animals.
Wildlife officials expect to see more of the disease next winter [2007], as
deer start to congregate on winter feeding grounds. "We see it some place
every year but not necessarily in the same place or level of intensity,"
Miller said. "But we won't get too worried about it, unless we see it for
several years in the same place."

[Pink-eye is a term applied to a number of causes of excessively red or
pink eyes. It almost always refers to some type of irritation of the eye.
Generally, these conditions affect the tissues surrounding the eye but may
also involve the cornea of the eye.
Some causes include bacteria, such as _Moraxella_ spp., _Chlamydia_ spp.,
and _Mycoplasma_ spp. Dust and flies may serve to irritate the eye, or to
even help transfer the bacteria to the eye.
This is likely a limited disease that will run its course through a
relatively small group of deer. - Mod.TG]
