BRUSSELS -- Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been eradicated from the
15-nation European Union except for Britain, EU Health and Consumer
Protection Commissioner David Byrne said Friday.
The EU commissioner said a new European food authority providing expertise
and monitoring new forms of danger from foodstuffs was expected to go
operational next year.
The Brussels Commission would also carry out a reappraisal of the rules
concerning vaccination to prevent FMD. The disease had been "eradicated in
all the member-states except the United Kingdom," he said.
The outbreak was largely under control at European level. "But a high level
of vigilance remains an imperative in all member-states," Byrne stressed.
An appraisal-in-depth had been in progress since April on all aspects of EU
legislation concerning control and eradication of foot-and-mouth.
A conference on the topic expected in the autumn would examine whether
vaccination ought to be used as a preventive measure.
Asked whether consumer confidence had been shaken in the long term by the
FMD and BSE crises, Byrne said: "It's undeniable consumer confidence in the
ability of the food sector and the public authorities to guarantee a high
protection level has been shaken."
The official said he would introduce new proposals this autumn to
strengthen and harmonize food controls in member-states. Byrne also noted
much remained to be done to help the public to get food risks in
proportion. These risks were far lower than those from tobacco, he said.
