South Wales; Measles Spreading inn in Swansea Valley
----------------------------------------------------
Health officials are investigating an outbreak of measles in a
community in the Swansea Valley, south Wales. Three cases of measles
have been confirmed in children around the Clydach area and there are
three other suspected cases. An expert in communicable diseases says
the outbreak is believed to be linked to a children's party held last
month. The spread of the disease is also linked to the low take-up in
the area of the triple Mumps, Measles and Rubella (MMR) vaccine, she
added. All the children affected by the outbreak are reported to be
recovering well.
Dr Sara Hayes, Consultant in Communicable Disease Control with the
National Public Health Service (NPHS)for Wales, said: "These cases
have been linked to a party held in late June. It does suggest that
the low MMR uptake in the area is allowing individual cases to spread
and generate further cases." She said only around 70 percent of
children in the Swansea area were currently receiving the triple
vaccine which guards against measles, mumps and rubella. "We have not
had any outbreaks of this seriousness in our area for a long time,"
said Dr Hayes.
Measles can lead to other illnesses such as earache and pneumonia and
in rare cases (around one in 500) can result in death, she said.
Early symptoms of measles are coughs, colds and conjunctivitis and
white spots -- like grains of salt -- in the mouth. That is followed
by a blotchy red rash on the face which spreads down the body. People
are infectious from before the appearance of the rash until around 4
days after it appears.
Investigations into the Clydach outbreak are continuing. Dr Richard
Roberts, head of the NPHS vaccine preventable disease programme in
Wales, said: "Our message is that MMR can be given at any age --
it's never too late, so think about getting it done. Parents do have
a choice in this, but they need access to accurate information on
risks and benefits in order to make an informed choice." He said
there were no cases of measles in Wales in 1996, but by 2002 there
were 3 confirmed cases and 44 in 2003.

[It is likely that the resurgence of measles in South Wales can be
accounted for by the low uptake of the triple MMR vaccine in the
Swansea area rather than as a consequence of the appearance of a
strain of measles virus of either enhanced virulence or altered
antigenicity. The identification of a children's party as the focus
of the outbreak is an unusual feature. - Mod.CP]
