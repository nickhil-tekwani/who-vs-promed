re: ProMED-mail. Avian influenza (31): Ghana (BA) poultry, HPAI H9N2, new strain, OIE 20180215.5628421
----------------------------------------------------------------------
After confirmation by the OIE Reference Laboratory and the delegate from Ghana, please be informed that the molecular and pathogenicity analysis performed confirmed H9N2 low pathogenic avian influenza virus. As this isolate is not OIE notifiable, the report has been removed from WAHIS interface as of 19 Mar 2018.

[ProMED-mail's posting 20180215.5628421 presented an immediate notification submitted by Ghana's chief veterinary officer on 14 Feb 2018, notifying an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza which had started on 3 Jan 2018 and was confirmed on 10 Jan 2018. The reason for notification was given as "new strain of a listed disease in the country" and the causal agent, "highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, serotype H9N2". The outbreak was recorded on a farm with 16 822 susceptible "78 weeks old brown layers in deep litter" of which 4225 cases (deaths) were counted. The remaining 12 597 birds were, reportedly, killed and disposed of. The diagnosis was performed by the Accra Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory) applying real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR), found positive.

The OIE notification above was accompanied by Mod.CRD's commentary, including the following remark:
"It is well known that LPAI H9N2 circulates in Africa. However, this would be the 1st time that the subtype H9N2 is characterized as a highly pathogenic strain. Further laboratory studies may be needed to fully characterize the virus. If it is indeed a highly pathogenic strain as reported, this would be quite alarming for both animal and public health."

The reporting, by Ghana, of the case demonstrates transparency and deserves to be commended. It is relieving indeed to note that an alarming reassortment of the widespread H9N2 strain into high pathogenicity has not taken place.

The event highlights the need for continued vigilance, in Africa and elsewhere, as well as the importance of involving OIE reference laboratories in epidemiological investigations. - Mod.AS
