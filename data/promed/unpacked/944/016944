The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports 2 new variants of the influenza (flu) virus normally found in pigs have now infected 2 children. CDC states variant virus flu infections are rare and usually take place from exposure to pigs with only a small number of infections unable to be traced to the animals. One of the new human infections took place where a person did have contact with pigs before illness, but in the other case there was no known pig exposure, meaning it could have been spread from human-to-human contact.

It is not believed the 2 cases spread the virus to any other humans. The new variants are part of the H3N2 and H1N1 groups. Neither child was hospitalized, and both have recovered [according to] CDC.

CDC says pigs can spread influenza viruses back and forth from the animals to humans and humans to animals through droplets, leading to new variants. The agency adds that those in close contact with pigs at home, work, or at fairs should take precautions to avoid human infection.

When people are infected with influenza A viruses that are known to be genetically similar to viruses circulating in swine, these viruses are called "variant viruses" and denoted with a letter "v". Human infections with A(H1N1)v, A(H1N2)v, and A(H3N2)v viruses have been detected in the United States (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/variant.htm). The FluView Interactive Novel Flu A tool (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/Novel_Influenza.html) reflects the most current case counts for variant virus infections reported in the United States since 2010.

Novel viruses are detected with methods available for detection of currently circulating human influenza viruses at state public health laboratories (for example, real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]). Confirmation that an influenza A virus represents a novel virus is performed by CDC's influenza laboratory. Once a novel virus has been identified by CDC, confirmation may be made by public health laboratories following CDC-recommended protocols for that specific virus, or by laboratories using an FDA-authorized test specific for detection of that novel influenza virus.

During 2021, 14 cases of human infection with swine origin variant influenza viruses have been reported. Out of these, 7 cases of influenza A H1N1v (Wisconsin 3, Iowa 3, North Dakota 1) and 3 confirmed cases of influenza A H3N2v (Wisconsin 1, Iowa 1, Ohio 1) have been reported thus far.

Most infections with variant viruses have occurred in children (persons 18 or younger), and most cases have reported direct or indirect exposure to swine before onset of illness. Limited transmission from close contact with an infected person has been observed in some investigations of human infections with variant viruses, but sustained human-to-human transmission has not been documented. - Mod.UBA
