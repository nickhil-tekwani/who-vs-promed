The Moratuwa University was closed indefinitely yesterday after over
50 hostellers came down with a sudden viral fever suspected to have
been contracted through a group of research students who visited the
flood-hit areas during the past few days.
The Vice Chancellor of the University Prof. Dayantha Wijesekera told
the Daily News that they took action to postpone the academic
activities for several days as a precautionary measure to prevent a
further spread of this mysterious disease. "We will be meeting to
discuss a date to re-open the university on Tuesday," he said.
According to university sources, the viral flu is suspected have been
contracted by students who voluntarily visited the flood-affected
areas during the past few days to carry out relief distribution and a
damage assessment study.
Most of the sick hostellers have gone to their home towns to get
medication, while others who are seriously ill have been admitted to
nearby hospitals.
Meanwhile residents in Moratuwa have expressed fears that the viral
fever could spread further through the students remaining in private
boarding houses in the area

[In the absence of information on the clinical presentation of the
outbreak other than "fever" and "viral flu," we are left with a
description of an outbreak that occurred among students involved with
"flood relief." We do not know whether the outbreak is confined only
to those students involved in the flood relief, or whether there were
secondary cases among their contacts upon return to the university
residential setting. If the outbreak is confined only to those who
visited the flood zones, there is the possibility of common exposure,
possibly vector-borne, or contaminated ingestion, such as food or
water. If there has been secondary spread to those not involved in
the flood relief, there is the possibility of a primary
person-to-person transmission etiology.
Hence, without more information on the clinical syndrome and
epidemiology of this outbreak, the water is too muddy to allow for a
solid differential diagnosis of probable etiologies of this outbreak.
The references below are the result of a search among prior
ProMED-mail postings for "Sri Lanka" and "fever" -- they have
included as-yet-undiagnosed illness in Jaffna in January 2003
(referred to as a "mystery flu", "viral fever", with dengue fever and
typhoid fever mentioned as ruled out -- clinically associated with
high fever, pneumonia, confusion, renal and respiratory failure),
multiple outbreaks of dengue fever, suspected epidemic typhus, and a
respiratory illness in 1998 that included fever, coughing, vomiting,
and stomach pains.
A simple search for fever, adult, case cluster in Sri Lanka using the
GIDEON software (Global infectious disease and epidemiology network
<http://www.gideononline.com/>) returns 90 possible etiologies
including viral, bacterial, and parasitic organisms; if one changes
the criteria to fever, child, case cluster, there are only 18
possible etiologies returned -- as they are university students, both
lists are probable applicable. All that being said, the safest
approach is to request further information from knowledgeable
individuals on this current outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
