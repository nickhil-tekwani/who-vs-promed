Dear ProMED colleagues,

My name is Farah Seedat and I am a PhD student at the Warwick Medical School in collaboration with the UK National Screening Committee. In an effort to help inform antenatal screening decisions for Group B Strep, we are currently undertaking a project investigating the contextual predictors of neonatal Group B Strep, _E. coli_, and neonatal sepsis across countries. In order to do this, we are looking for datasets on these outcomes across several countries, so that data can be combined to conduct the analysis. Specifically, we are looking for the aggregate incidence rates of the above-mentioned diseases amongst all newborn babies in your country, region, or hospital, along with the percentage of newborns that die from the disease, and the percentage of newborns with the disease that are resistant to different antibiotics. Collaborators will be offered authorship under the umbrella of the International Group B Strep Collaboration, as we aim to include more than 50 countries and will have over 50 authors.

If you have collected data for any of these variables in this area and are interested in collaborating with us, or if you know of datasets in your country, can you please email me at <f.seedat@warwick.ac.uk>. We can then arrange to discuss this further over the phone or Skype, so that I can tell you more about the project, the list of variables that I am interested in, and the possibility of collaborating with you or your colleagues.

I do hope are able to participate in this worthwhile and interesting project, which will hopefully prove beneficial to make evidence-based screening decisions. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you very much for your time.
