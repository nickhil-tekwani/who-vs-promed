[The following information has been extracted from the Rapid Risk Assessment on HPAIV H5 in Germany on 25 Mar 2021, pages 13 and 14, which is available in ref 1:

"In Germany, around 1000 HPAIV H5 cases in wild birds and 133 outbreaks in poultry and captive birds have been detected since [30 Oct 2020]. In addition, many European countries continue to report outbreaks of HPAIV subtype H5 in captive birds and wild birds. The risk of spread in waterfowl populations and disease introduction in poultry farms and bird populations (e.g., zoological institutions) is considered high. Currently, there is a high risk of introduction of HPAIV subtype H5 through virus spread between poultry farms (secondary outbreaks). Utmost caution is indicated in (mobile) trade with live poultry. Biosecurity measures in poultry holdings should be reviewed and optimized where possible."

Poultry and Captive birds in Germany:
"In Germany, 133 outbreaks have occurred so far in poultry, including captive birds in zoological facilities. Wherever there are potential contacts between wild birds and domestic poultry, especially waterfowl, infections can be introduced, and new sources of infection can emerge unless an escape of virus from affected flocks can be prevented. Virus-contaminated material (footwear, vehicles, objects, litter) is considered the most likely source of infection. Poultry farms that share and move litter or other materials or tools, or even batches of birds, between units are particularly at risk.

"Between [21 Dec 2020 and 16 Jan 2021], a series of 18 HPAI H5 outbreaks occurred in turkeys (mostly fatteners) and one in ducks in the district of Cloppenburg, a region with high poultry density. The sources of infection are unknown. However, the full genome sequences of the viruses from the affected holdings are almost identical, so that secondary spread between the flocks can be assumed.

"Another series of outbreaks relating to HPAIV H5N8 occurred since the end of February [2021] in the district of Cloppenburg that recorded 18 outbreaks, including 16 turkey fattening farms. According to TSN reports, a total of 1.6 million birds have been affected since the beginning of the epidemic in 2020/2021; in Lower Saxony alone, the number of birds in affected farms has reached one million. Spread of infection is also possible across the federal states, and especially likely if poultry are traded. Currently, there are a number of HPAI outbreaks and suspicions of disease in poultry in Baden-Wurttemberg and Thuringia that could indicate such a spread."

Wild Birds:
"Similar to the HPAIV H5N8 event in 2016/2017, increased mortality is now observed predominantly in waterfowl and bird species that also feed on carrion, e.g., various raptors, owls and gulls. The range of species affected is similar across Europe. Exceedingly high mortality rates were observed in barnacle geese, wigeons, and red knots in the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park in December 2020. The situation there has calmed down in the meantime. Deceased and infected birds of prey, gulls, and owls are indicators of a localized outbreak in the area. Multiple findings of HPAIV H5-positive droppings of mallards, teals, and wigeons highlight that ducks can excrete the virus without becoming visibly ill or dying. Since the end of February [2021], many European countries have been reporting increased detection of HPAIV H5 in swans.

"Infected but asymptomatic wild birds or those incubating the disease can be seen as mobile virus carriers that have the potential to spread the virus further. Many waterfowl species (e.g., geese, swans, some duck species) move between farmland (especially grassland, maize stubble, and winter rapeseed and cereal crops), where they feed during the day, and resting waters, which they visit in the evening and at night. They can excrete the virus via their droppings and contaminate the land and water that they visit. In addition, sick and dead waterfowl that may be predated by mammals such as foxes and martens, but also birds of prey and crows, may lead to considerable environmental contamination on arable and grazing land in cases where high viral loads exist. Further indirect spread of virus through people or vehicles entering such areas can lead to the introduction of the virus into poultry farms.

"Low temperatures in winter stabilize the infectivity of influenza viruses in the environment. When waterfowl congregate in high numbers, virus transmission and spread between wild bird species are facilitated. Due to the fact that not all wild waterfowl can be fully surveilled, the actual spread of HPAI H5 viruses can only be estimated via sporadic case identifications. It must be assumed that the viruses continue to spread in wild birds in Germany, possibly without a noticeable increase in mortality.

"The cold arctic air since the beginning of February [2021] has caused snow and ice in northern and central Germany, and more dynamic bird movements can be expected as many water bird species seek out ice-free waters. Under such weather conditions, the infection of wild birds may spread inland and further into southern and western Europe. Swans seem to be particularly frequently affected at present and conspicuous regarding their high HPAIV-related mortality.

"The spring migration of northern water birds is currently underway. There are strong migratory movements within Europe from western and southwestern to eastern and northeastern directions (geese, swans, ducks, divers), which could continue to spread HPAI viruses supra-regionally."
