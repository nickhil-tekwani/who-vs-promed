Avian influenza situation in Cambodia - WHO update 3
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia has announced
a confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1)
virus.

The case was a 5 year old girl from Pea Raing district, Prey Veng
Province. She developed symptoms on 11 Apr 2011, was initially treated
by local private practitioners with no effect, and was later admitted
to Kantha Bopha Children Hospital on 13 Apr 2011. Despite all
intensive care, she died on 16 Apr 2011, 4 days after admission.

There have been reports of poultry die off in her village. The girl
is the 15th person in Cambodia to become infected with the H5N1 virus
and the 13nth to die from complications of the disease. All 5 cases of
H5N1 infections in humans in Cambodia this year have been fatal.

Specimens from 53 contacts of the cases were collected and are being
tested by the National Institute for Public Health laboratory.
