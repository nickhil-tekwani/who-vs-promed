Over the weekend, reports indicate that late blight is showing up
everywhere across southwest Florida on both tomato and potato. This
disease can spread quickly and devastate a tomato or potato field
within a few weeks if not properly controlled. Growers should scout
their fields thoroughly each day, especially when cool and wet
conditions conducive to disease development prevail.

Important cultural controls include destruction of cull piles,
infected foliage and volunteer potato or tomato plants. Begin a spray
program with fungicides if late blight is in your area or weather
conditions are suitable for late blight development. Currently,
fungicides are the most effective means of control until cultivars
with resistance to this disease become available. Fungicides slow the
rate at which the disease develops in the field. Even a short break
in spray schedules can result in a dramatic increase in blight.

In Florida, it has been observed that seldom does a widespread late
blight epidemic occur on tomatoes in the Manatee-Ruskin area unless
the disease was present in the Immokalee area and/or Dade County.
Since late blight has been confirmed on tomato in Immokalee, growers
in other areas are advised to adhere to a preventative spray program.

[2] Potato - Ireland: new strain
Date: 4 Jan 2009

The disease that wiped out the potato crop in the mid-19th century,
causing more than one million deaths, is posing a renewed menace
after a more aggressive strain has arrived, according to a leading
scientist. This has prompted experts to intensify work, including
using GM technology, to find a blight-resistant variety.

Dr Ewen Mullins, a research officer with Teagasc, the agriculture and
food development authority, said the risk of blight has become more
serious. He said: "We have humid summers, and the past 2 years have
seen outbreaks of blight, probably the worst on record. A new strain
has come in. It migrated westward across Europe, probably in the past
12 to 18 months. It was in the UK about 2 years ago and in the
eastern counties of Ireland in 2008. It's a highly aggressive
strain." The new strain can survive in the soil up to 4 years.
Scientists fear that it could infect a crop before it even emerges
above ground.

Currently, potato farmers have to spray their crops up to 12 times a
year. But Mullins and his colleagues hope to create a variety that
will only need to be sprayed 4 times a year. The decreased use of
fungicides would, in turn, mean less damage to the environment.

Mullins said farmers relying on normal potato crops would also be
affected by new EU regulations aimed at reducing use of pesticides
and fungicides. "If we were to reduce chemicals by up to 40 percent
on our potato crop, that would challenge potato growers," he said.
"We [think] GM is worth investigating from that point of view."

Teagasc is investigating the environmental impact of a number of GM
crops and whether they could provide an economic benefit to farmers
via reduced chemical costs. Newer varieties are more disease resistant.

[Late blight of potato and tomato is caused by the fungus-like
organism _Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop
loss. It is spread by contaminated plant and other material, wind and
water. Solanaceous weeds and volunteer crop plants can serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Fungi and bacteria often invade blight-infected
potato tubers resulting in total tuber breakdown. Under favorable
conditions, epidemics in tomatoes may be even more rapid than in potatoes.

Disease management includes preventative fungicide treatment of
planting material (potato seed tubers, tomato transplants) and
additional fungicide applications to the crop. While commercial crop
cultivars vary in susceptibility to late blight, development of
resistant cultivars is being counteracted by the adaptability of the
pathogen, with new strains evolving all the time. For more
