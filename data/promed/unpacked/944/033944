I spoke with Dr Louise MacFarland, Louisiana State Epidemiologist, this
afternoon, Friday, and she confirmed that there have now been a total of
eight SLE cases confirmed in Jefferson Parish, and two in Lafayette.
Two suspects are still awaiting laboratory confirmation. Results are
expected on Tuesday, 8 Sep 1998.
