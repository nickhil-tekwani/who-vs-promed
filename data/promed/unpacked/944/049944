The Mauritanian Ministry of Health announced on Sunday [13 Feb 2022] that it had recorded 2 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever at the beginning of February [2022].

In a circular, the ministry calls for vigilance and the strengthening of measures throughout the country, warning against negligence in the face of contagious diseases.

The Ministry of Health has instructed regional health directors and chief medical officers inside the country to increase epidemiological monitoring measures in addition to taking other measures to prevent the infiltration of any cases of dangerous diseases.

Crimean-Congo fever is one of the most dangerous hemorrhagic fevers and according to the World Health Organization (WHO), this disease is transmitted to humans by ticks and by cattle, and from person to person through contact with blood.

According to the WHO, although it has appeared for a long time, there is no vaccine against this disease either for people or for animals. Its treatment is limited to dealing with the symptoms and permanent follow-up of the patient.

From time to time, cases of this disease appear in Mauritania and the last case recorded was at the end of October 2020.

Director-General of Public Health, Dr Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Eel Mahmoud, during a press conference said the Ministry of Health announced on Sunday [13 Feb 2022], the registration of 2 cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever during the past days, one of them in a Nouakchott hospital, and the other inside the country.

The Director-General of Public Health said that one of 2 two cases was discovered in a Nouakchott hospital and that the 2nd case was in a hospital inside, without specifying the location.

In a clarification published by the Ministry of Health on its Facebook page, Ould Eel Mahmoud confirmed that the 2 cases came from the same area, which is a pastoral area in one of the governorates of the interior.

Ould Eel Mahmoud warned that this disease is one of the endemic diseases in West Africa and that one or 2 cases are discovered annually in Mauritania, usually in people whose jobs require them to mix with animals.

Ould Eel Mahmoud said that the ministry issued to health centers and points an order to be vigilant and monitor the health situation, and to alert citizens to be careful.

Ould Eel Mahmoud added that the ministry announced the discovery of the 2 cases, and the measures taken "in line with the ministry's strategy to expose citizens to all developments related to public health."

Ould Eel Mahmoud reassured citizens about this fever, adding that joint missions were dispatched between the ministry and the Ministry of Animal Development to monitor the situation, isolate suspected animals, search for other possible cases, and take the necessary measures in a timely manner.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for these reports on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases reported in Mauritania.

The 1st case was reported last week (https://nouakchot.com/article/24753; in Arabic) and the reports above indicate that the 2 cases are from the same area in the interior of the country.

Most known human cases of CCHF in West Africa have been reported from southern Mauritania. The 1st case was documented in 1983(1) in a camel and cattle breeder in Selibaby, Guidimakha region, possibly related to close contact with infected camels or cattle.

Subsequent reports of cases were from the Trarza region with possible involvement of sheep as a source of transmission to humans(2). In 2003, a major outbreak was reported, involving 35 persons in Nouakchott, along with secondary infections among hospital staff, and sporadic reports from Brakna and Hodh Elgharbi regions(3).

In 2015, a study on hemorrhagic fever during a Rift Valley fever outbreak in Mauritania showed that 6/184 (3.3%) samples, mostly from the southern part of the country, were positive for CCHF viral RNA(4). Animal studies also have demonstrated a high seroprevalence in cattle in Mauritania.

Most cases of CCHF in this region have been reported during the long dry season (December-July)(5).

The recent reports highlight that CCHF is both enzootic and endemic in Mauritania and that there is a need for better diagnostic capacity, increased awareness, and knowledge of the epidemiology of CCHF among health providers, and regional surveillance using a One Health approach.
