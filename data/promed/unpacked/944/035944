Every 5 years, there is an increase in the number of cases of mumps in Galicia. These are cyclic outbreaks. There was one of such instances between 2001 and 2002, another one between 2005 and 2006, so now another outbreak was expected and it is occurring in Vigo, the most populated area of Galicia, compared with elsewhere in the autonomous region. So far this year [2013], 193 persons in Vigo have become infected with mumps.

For the last week for which official information is available, 4-11 Feb 2013, 39 persons became infected in Vigo, whereas in the rest of Galicia, 43 people became infected. So, what is going on in Vigo to explain this high incidence of mumps?

"It is merely chance," said the chief of the Epidemiological Alert Service in the Sanitation Council in this province. She explained that, for instance, the previous outbreak started in the Pontevedra area and then it spread outwards. "We foresee that this outbreak may extend to the whole of Galicia." Considering past experience, experts expect that this increase in the number of cases may last for the whole year. When measuring the incidence of a disease, the value is expressed as the number of (new) cases per 100 000 inhabitants. For 2012, the incidence of mumps in Galicia was 1.5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. During the last 4 weeks of 2012, the figure increased to 6.8 per 100 000. In Vigo at present, the incidence of mumps is 33.1 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. In other words, the figure has skyrocketed 22-fold.

Health officials do not completely know what has happened but several hypotheses have been proposed. A mumps vaccine is included in the routine immunization schedule. One dose is administered at 15 months of age and the other at 3 years, as part of the so called triple viral [MMR] vaccine, which also includes immunisation against measles and rubella. This schedule was introduced in Galicia in 1982. One hypothesis explaining this occurrence states that the triple vaccine may lose its effectiveness with time. Another hypothesis proposes that there may be a group of persons that missed one dose of vaccine because until 1999 the 2nd dose was administered at 11 years of age, and subsequently the vaccine was administered at 3 years of age. The 3rd hypothesis proposes that persons born before 1980, who never received the vaccine, may play a role in this occurrence [that is, the persistence of mumps virus infection].

Ms. Maria Jose Faraldo notes that mumps is "a benign and mild viral infection". Nowadays this condition is particularly affecting young people between 15 and 25 years of age. Many cases have been detected in different health centers in the city. Health authorities recommend that in order to avoid spreading the disease, affected persons not go to school or to their workplace during a 5 day period after the occurrence of swelling in the parotid gland area.

[The periodicity of epidemics of mumps virus infection in Spain is an interesting phenomenon and may be a consequence of the properties of the vaccine strains incorporated into the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccines employed in earlier years. In a recent comparison (see: Demicheli V, Rivetti A, Debalini MG, Di Pietrantonj C: Vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella in children. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Feb 15; 2:CD004407. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub3; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22336803) the effectiveness of at least one dose of MMR in preventing clinical mumps in children is estimated to be between 69 percent and 81 percent for the vaccine prepared with Jeryl Lynn mumps strain and between 70 percent and 75 percent for the vaccine containing the Urabe strain. Vaccination with MMR containing the Urabe strain has demonstrated to be 73 percent effective in preventing secondary mumps cases. Effectiveness of Jeryl Lynn containing MMR in preventing laboratory-confirmed mumps cases in children and adolescents was estimated to be between 64 percent to 66 percent for one dose and 83 percent to 88 percent for 2 vaccine doses.

However there may be other reasons for the periodicity such as the proportion of the population receiving mumps virus vaccine.

Galicia is an autonomous community in northwest Spain, with the official status of a nationality. It comprises the provinces of A Coruna, Lugo, Ourense, and Pontevedra, being bordered by Portugal to the south, the Spanish autonomous communities of Castile and Leon and Asturias to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Bay of Biscay to the north. It had a population of 2 778 913 in 2012. Vigo is a is a city and municipality, the most populous city in Galicia, and the 14th in Spain.
