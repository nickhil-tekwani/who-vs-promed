MEDIA COVERAGE PRIORITIES
=========================
I find it very interesting and more than a little dismaying how the press
handles reports of emerging and epidemic diseases. Over the last 2 weeks we
have heard increasingly frequent and repetitive reports about the 10 cases of
atypical CJD in England, and its possible (though tenuous) relationship to
BSE. Meanwhile, a region of Africa has suffered a devastating epidemic of
cerebrospinal meningitis with 51,541 stricken and 6,504 dead as of 3/27, and
I have not seen word one about this in the press. It makes me question the
priorities of what is most people's main source of information.
