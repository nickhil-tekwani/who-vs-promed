The municipal Health Secretariat is analyzing another possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection] after a 52-year-old man was hospitalized early this morning with symptoms of the disease. He was admitted with a febrile syndrome and respiratory difficulty. Samples were taken and sent to the Instituto Maiztegui in Pergamino", the head of the area, Guillermo Sancho said, who added that personnel from Bromatology to review the area in which a few days ago a 21-year-old young man died of similar complications. Finally, he explained, "We are acting on guard in this sense. If we have a suspected case with undetermined fever we send [samples] for testing."

"Hantavirus is [causes] a serious acute viral disease, caused by [a] hantavirus. Field mice (mainly the long-tailed ones) transmit [the virus] to people, shedding the virus in saliva, feces and urine," stated the national Ministry of Health.

Transmission is via inhalation, which is the most frequent cause and occurs when we breathe in open or closed places (sheds, gardens, pastures) where the feces or urine of the infected rodents disburse the virus contaminating the environment. Also [transmission can occur] by direct contact, touching live or dead rodents, their feces or urine, or by bite of infected rodents.

The symptoms present like those of influenza: fever, muscle pain, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting and, at times, abdominal pain and diarrhea. After a few days, there can be respiratory difficulty which can become worse, causing what is known as "hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, which is infrequent and can lead to death if not treated in time.

[With this new case, the number of cases of hantavirus infection continues to increase in Buenos Aires province this year (2018). The above report indicates that 2 fatal cases of the infection in this region of the province have already occurred in 2018. The environment in which these individuals might have acquired their infections was not mentioned. As with the report above, the reports of hantavirus infections that ProMED receives very seldom mention which hantavirus is the etiologic agent of the cases. Cases of hantavirus infection with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome have been reported from various parts of Argentina over recent years. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina; in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Marciel virus in the dark bolo mouse, _Bolomys obscurus_), Lechiguana and Central Plata (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina; in _O. longicaudatus_); Anajatuba and Juquitiba (in _Oligoryzomys forensi_) and Bermejo (western Argentina; in _O. chaoensis_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in this case. It might have been due to infection by the Buenos Aires virus. The rodent host of this virus has not been determined.

Although the long-tailed rodents were mentioned as possible hosts in the report above, the rodent host of the suspected hantavirus endemic in this area was not reported. An image of this rodent can be accessed at https://alchetron.com/Oligoryzomys. - Mod.TY
