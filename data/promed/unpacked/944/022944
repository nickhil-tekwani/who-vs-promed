Another case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever was recently registered in Georgia's Shida Kartli region. One of the locals in the region was revealed about a week ago to have the symptoms of the disease.

Vaccination of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is being held in Shida Kartli region.

This April 2014, 2 people died from this disease in Georgia, and 13 cases of infection with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever [virus] have been identified in Khashuri region of the country.

The disease poses a risk to human life, but in case of timely visit to the doctor, the patient can be saved, doctors say.

Currently, 5 people are undergoing treatment for the disease in the Infectious Diseases Hospital of Tbilisi, one of whom is a 6-year-old girl.

The National Center for Disease Control and Public Health of Georgia noted that the epidemiological situation in the country at present is not a cause for concern.

[Cases of CCHF virus infection continue to pop up in Georgia this year (2014), with a total of reported cases now at 13. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140418.2413017, CCHF virus is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north.

CCHFV is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. CCHF virus can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent.

Mod.CP (see ProMED-mail archive 20130501.1684736) cited information summarized from a review in The Lancet by Talha Khan Burki (Lancet 2012; 380(9857): 1897-8. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62097-2; http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62097-2/fulltext): In its immature form, the tick feeds on small mammals. Later, the adult tick attaches itself to cattle, sheep, goats, or human beings. Livestock show no overt signs of disease, and farmers and slaughterhouse workers have little idea they have been infected until they start expressing symptoms: dizziness, muscular pain, and stiffness, and of course the signature bleeding. Whereas infection in birds mostly tends to be abortive, ostriches are important hosts. In the mid 1990s, South Africa saw a CCHF outbreak at an ostrich abattoir.

About 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have reported CCHF. The tick is found no further than 50 degrees north latitude, which cuts across Russia, Ukraine, central Europe, and France; the latter 2 regions are not considered to be at any immediate risk; the _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks are present, but there is no serological evidence of CCHF. The distribution of known cases across the Middle East and Africa is patchy; ticks are present in the whole of this region, but in many countries, it seems harmless. In Africa, only South Africa, and from time to time Mauritania, face ongoing outbreaks; countries such as Tanzania and Uganda have not reported any recent outbreaks; and countries such as Angola and Algeria seem not to be at risk.

Only 4 countries report more than 50 cases per year: Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan (although, it could easily be the case that these countries simply have particularly efficient surveillance systems backed by proper diagnostics).
