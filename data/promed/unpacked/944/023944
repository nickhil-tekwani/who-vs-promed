Authorities of the Los Santos Ministry of Health confirm the 3rd case of [a] hantavirus [infection] acquired in Las Tablas. The affected individual is currently in the intensive care unit of the Joaquin Pablo Sayas Hospital.

Just this past week the authorities reported 2 cases of hantavirus [infections]; these male patients are currently hospitalized.

Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] is an acute and serious viral disease caused by [a] hantavirus. Field mice (mainly long-tailed [pygmy rice rats]) transmit the virus to people. The virus is shed in saliva, feces, and urine and transmitted through inhalation when breathing in open or closed spaces (sheds, gardens, pastures) where infected rodents shed the virus in their feces and urine, contaminating the environment. Transmission can occur when touching live or dead rodents directly or the feces or urine of these rodents. Transmission can also occur by rodent bite.

The symptoms [in humans] are similar to those of influenza: fever, muscle pain, chills, headache, nausea, vomiting and, sometimes, abdominal pain and diarrhea. After some days, respiratory difficulty may occur and become worse.

[Apparently, this is a new case not previously reported. However, without a total case count for the year, one cannot be certain that it is new. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving the total case count for 2014 up to, and including, the above case. The Los Santos province is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from Las Tablas. Although not specified in the report above, or previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with hospitalizations in Panama.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
