Here follow excerpts from official Ministry of Health press releases
regarding the current dengue fever epidemic in Fiji.
January 7, 1998
Overall, there have been an estimated total of 1,500 clinically suspected
dengue cases seen at Ministry of Health Facilities in the last three to
four weeks. This figure does not include cases seen by private doctors.
[Writer's note - physicians in Fiji are not currently in compliance with
reporting regulations. Thus it would be hard to confirm whether there have
been any visitors affected, but so far none have been seen at Ministry of
Health facilities, where serious cases would be routinely referred - there
are no private hospitals in Fiji. There are no reports that the disease has
affected tourists so far, and the two main areas of the outbreak -
peri-urban Suva and Lautoka - are not significant tourism destinations.
CWM Hospital reports an average of 25 suspected cases per day in the
outpatient department, and 4 admissions. At this rate, suspected cases seen
to date are estimated at more than 500, with at least 80 admissions.
Lautoka Hospital estimates having seen more than 300 suspected cases in the
last three weeks with at least 33 admissions. There have been no
additional deaths beyond the first three reported.
[Writer's note - Clinical case management guidelines supplied by the World
Health Organization have been circulated to doctors throughout Fiji in an
effort to minimise complications and deaths from DHF. It is unclear exactly
how many cases of DHF there are, but there have been at least 20 suspected
DHF cases reported from hospital wards, including the three deaths - the
real numbers may never be known.
There have been more than 500 clinically suspected dengue fever cases to
date from Subdivisional Hospitals and Health Centres run by the Ministry of
Health. Facilities reporting cases included Valelevu (200+ cases), Raiwaqa
(250+ cases - 3 confirmed), Nayavu, Nuffield, Wainibokasi, Korovou,
Vunidawa, and Savusavu (all less than 10 cases so far).
[Writer's note - all the affected reporting areas mentioned except Savusavu
are located on Fiji's main island of Viti Levu with ~75% of Fiji's
population of 780,000
Health Centres in Sigatoka, Rakiraki, Nadi, Taveuni, Labasa, Nabouwalu,
Levuka, Lomaloma, Lodoni, Mokani, Korvisilou and Navua all reported that no
cases had been seen. THESE AREAS SHOULD WORK TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF
DENGUE BY DESTROYING MOSQUITO BREEDING SITES.
Dr. Asinate Boladuadua
Acting Permanent Secretary for Health
7 January 1998
[Writer's note - There have been at least 12 cases in the recent outbreak
confirmed by ELISA, but no serotyping data is yet available on the large
number of samples collected so far. Fiji government has been spraying
affected areas with insecticides, concentrating on hospitals, and the two
main affected peri-urban areas of Lautoka and Suva. An intense public
information campaign is underway including television and radio
advertising, and extensive news coverage in the local media.
Regarding the message on Radio Australia in a previous ProMED-mail posting,
I have not heard anything to support the claim that "...the Fiji Government
Virus Laboratory in Suva has determined that the current outbreak of dengue
fever is caused by a new strain of the virus." This would surprise me,
since as far as I know the lab does not have the capacity to determine
this, but rather sends samples to the WHO Collaborating Centre in
Australia. Perhaps, this could have been a reference to the fact that the
last epidemic in 1990 was caused by dengue 1 virus, and that the a few of
the first six samples tested in Australia a few months ago were determined
to be dengue 2 virus. It is fair to say that overseas help is welcome to
combat the outbreak, but a good deal of emergency help is already being
provided by the WHO and the South Pacific Commission. Perhaps other
agencies that wished to help could concentrate their efforts on future
prevention activities and vector eradication. This is only my opinion, not
an official one.
