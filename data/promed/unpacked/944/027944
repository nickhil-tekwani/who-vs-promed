Nearly one-third of people with COVID-19 had lingering symptoms a median of 6 months after infection onset, a single-center prospective study suggested.

Among COVID-19 patients whose infections ranged from asymptomatic to severe, 2 problems -- fatigue and loss of smell or taste -- persisted most frequently, reported Helen Chu, MD, MPH, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and co-authors, in a JAMA Network Open research letter [see below]. "The effects of COVID-19 can linger far beyond acute infection, even in individuals who experienced mild illness," said co-author Denise McCulloch, MD, MPH, also of the University of Washington.

"To our knowledge, this study presents the longest follow-up symptom assessment post-illness, with individuals surveyed out to 9 months after their COVID diagnosis," she told MedPage Today. Earlier studies focused largely on long-term effects in hospitalized COVID patients, McCulloch noted. "Our study is unique in characterizing a group consisting of mostly outpatients: 90% of our cohort experienced only a mild COVID-19 illness, yet one-third continue to have lingering effects," she said. "Many of these individuals are young and have no pre-existing medical conditions, indicating that even relatively healthy individuals may face long-term impacts from their illness."

There's very little data about people who have long-term COVID symptoms, observed Allison Navis, MD, of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, who wasn't involved with the study.

Early in 2021, researchers in Wuhan, China, reported that 76% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had at least one symptom that persisted 6 months after acute infection, mostly fatigue or muscle weakness. "Studies of non-hospitalized patients have shown that anywhere from 35%-50% of non-hospitalized patients had symptoms 2-4 months later," Navis noted.

Fatigue, breathing issues, and cardiac concerns like chest pain are common findings, as are neurologic symptoms, she pointed out. Of patients at the Center for Post-COVID Care at Mount Sinai with neurology referrals, "about 65% come in with cognitive complaints or brain fog," Navis said. "Brain fog means different things to different people, but usually it's some combination of short-term memory issues, attention issues, and word-finding difficulty." It's a little different for every patient, she added: "A clear phenotype hasn't really emerged yet."

The University of Washington study followed 177 people with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who completed questionnaires from August-November 2020, 3-9 months after their COVID-19 onset (median, 169 days). Mean age was 48 and 57% were women. Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (13%). Across the cohort, 6.2% of participants were asymptomatic, 84.7% were outpatients with mild illness, and 9.0% were hospitalized with moderate or severe disease. Patients completed followup questionnaires a median of 169 days after COVID-19 onset.

Overall, 32.7% of outpatients and 31.3% of inpatients reported at least one persistent symptom, most commonly fatigue (13.6%) and loss of sense of smell or taste (13.6%). In addition, 13.0% reported other symptoms, including brain fog (2.3%). Among outpatients and hospitalized patients, 30.7% reported worse health-related quality of life compared with baseline; this figure was 12.5% for patients who never had overt COVID symptoms. About 8% of all participants said at least one activity of daily living suffered long-term consequences, most commonly household chores.

Study limitations include small sample size, single study location, and potential bias from self-reported symptoms, the researchers acknowledged. "We plan to continue to survey our cohort every 6 months for 2 years to continue to assess changes in long-term symptoms over time," McCulloch said. "With over 28 million cases of COVID-19 in the USA alone, if even a small percentage of people experience long-term debility, this could have significant and lasting health and economic consequences."

More research is needed to understand why some COVID-19 patients have lingering symptoms, Navis noted. "We don't know what's causing this. There might be different etiologies for different people; it might not be just one thing," she suggested. "Is it vascular? Is it metabolic? Is it inflammatory? It's hard to say."

"Introduction: Many individuals experience persistent symptoms and a decline in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness (1). Existing studies have focused on hospitalized individuals 30 to 90 days after illness onset (2-4) and have reported symptoms up to 110 days after illness (3). Longer-term sequelae in outpatients have not been well characterized.

"Methods: A longitudinal prospective cohort of adults with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was enrolled at the University of Washington with a concurrent cohort of healthy patients in a control group (eAppendix in the Supplement). Electronic informed consent was obtained, and the study was approved by the University of Washington human participants institutional review board. This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline. COVID-19 symptom data were obtained at the time of acute illness or retrospectively recounted at a 30-day enrollment visit. A total of 234 participants with COVID-19 were contacted between August and November 2020 to complete a single follow-up questionnaire between 3 and 9 months after illness onset. We did not perform statistical tests for this descriptive analysis because of the small numbers in each subgroup. Data analysis was conducted in R version 4.0.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing).

"Results: A total of 177 of 234 participants (75.6%; mean [range] age, 48.0 [18-94] years; 101 [57.1%] women) with COVID-19 completed the survey. Overall, 11 (6.2%) were asymptomatic, 150 (84.7%) were outpatients with mild illness, and 16 (9.0%) had moderate or severe disease requiring hospitalization (Table). Hypertension was the most common comorbidity (23 [13.0%]). The follow-up survey was completed a median (range) of 169 (31-300) days after illness onset among participants with COVID-19 (Figure, A) and 87 (71-144) days after enrollment among 21 patients in the control group. Among participants with COVID-19, persistent symptoms were reported by 17 of 64 patients (26.6%) aged 18 to 39 years, 25 of 83 patients (30.1%) aged 40 to 64 years, and 13 of 30 patients (43.3%) aged 65 years and older. Overall, 49 of 150 outpatients (32.7%), 5 of 16 hospitalized patients (31.3%), and 1 of 21 healthy participants (4.8%) in the control group reported at least one persistent symptom. Of 31 patients with hypertension or diabetes, 11 (35.5%) experienced ongoing symptoms.

"The most common persistent symptoms were fatigue (24 of 177 patients [13.6%]) and loss of sense of smell or taste (24 patients [13.6%]) (Figure, B). Overall, 23 patients (13.0%) reported other symptoms, including brain fog (4 [2.3%]). A total of 51 outpatients and hospitalized patients (30.7%) reported worse HRQoL compared with baseline vs 4 healthy participants and asymptomatic patients (12.5%); 14 patients (7.9%) reported negative impacts on at least one activity of daily living (ADL), the most common being household chores.

"Discussion: In this cohort of individuals with COVID-19 who were followed up for as long as 9 months after illness, approximately 30% reported persistent symptoms. A unique aspect of our cohort is the high proportion of outpatients with mild disease. Persistent symptoms were reported by one-third of outpatients in our study, consistent with a previously reported study (4), in which 36% of outpatients had not returned to baseline health by 14 to 21 days following infection. However, this has not been previously described 9 months after infection.

"Consistent with existing literature, fatigue was the most commonly reported symptom (2-4). This occurred in 14% of individuals in this study, lower than the 53% to 71% (2-4) reported in cohorts of hospitalized patients, likely reflecting the lower acuity of illness in our cohort. Furthermore, impairment in HRQoL has previously been reported among hospitalized patients who have recovered from COVID-19; we found 29% of outpatients reported worsened HRQoL (5).

"Notably, 14 participants, including 9 nonhospitalized individuals, reported negative impacts on ADLs after infection. With 57.8 million cases worldwide, even a small incidence of long-term debility could have enormous health and economic consequences (6).

"Study limitations include a small sample size, single study location, potential bias from self-reported symptoms during illness episode, and loss to follow-up of 57 participants. To our knowledge, this study presents the longest follow-up symptom assessment after COVID-19 infection. Our research indicates that the health consequences of COVID-19 extend far beyond acute infection, even among those who experience mild illness. Comprehensive long-term investigation will be necessary to fully understand the impact of this evolving viral pathogen."

[2] COVID brain fog (encephalopathy)
[A] Surprise find in COVID-19 brain capillaries
Date: Wed 17 Feb 2021
Source: MedPage Today [edited]
https://bit.ly/2NgHjLn


Large cell nuclei that appeared to be megakaryocytes were found in cortical capillaries of 5 people who died with severe COVID-19, neuropathologists reported.

"To further characterize these cells, we performed immunohistochemistry for CD61 and CD42b, markers of platelets and megakaryocytes," wrote David Nauen, MD, PhD, of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and colleagues, in a JAMA Neurology research letter. "CD61 labels these cells, as does CD42b, confirming their megakaryocyte identity." The cells were distinct from platelet clusters, which were found in postmortem intravascular precipitates.

This is the 1st known report of megakaryocytes in brain vessels in COVID-19 or any other disease, Nauen noted. "These are cells that normally live in the bone marrow," he said. "They've been seen in the lung and other places, but not in brain capillaries," Nauen told MedPage Today. "How they got there is a mystery."

This atypical finding is "extremely unanticipated and thought-evoking," observed Gerald Soff, MD, a hematologist with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, who wasn't involved with the research. "It's well known that COVID-19 is associated with activation of the clotting system, and this is part of the clotting system, although not the part that's typically targeted with anticoagulants," Soff said in an interview with MedPage Today. "The clinical impact is to be determined, but it suggests we should be looking more aggressively for circulating megakaryocyte fragments, which may indicate an additional target for intervention."

In their study, Nauen and colleagues assessed brain tissue from autopsies of 15 patients with nucleic acid-proven SARS-CoV-2 infection and confirmed pulmonary pathology, plus 2 control patients without COVID-19. In some cases, only fragments of brain were available. The first 5 cases were from Johns Hopkins; the remaining were randomly selected from autopsies of people who were stroke-free and who died with COVID-19 in April and May 2020 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

Megakaryocytes in brain capillaries were seen in tissues from COVID-19 patients who died in their 40s as well as patients in their 70s. Four of 5 were men. "It is notable that we found megakaryocytes in cortical capillaries in 33% of cases examined," the researchers pointed out. "Because the standard brain autopsy sections taken sampled at random only a minute portion of the cortical volume, finding these cells suggests the total burden could be considerable."

It's hard to say what the presence of megakaryocytes in brain capillaries means, Nauen said. Megakaryocytes are big cells: "It's like taking a football and shoving it into a pipe with the diameter of a golf ball," he noted. "It's going to occlude things. It's possible the fogginess or less sharp mentation that people with COVID-19 are reporting could be connected to that."

But other factors could contribute to COVID brain fog, too, said Avindra Nath, MD, of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland, who wasn't involved with the study. While the significance of megakaryocytes in cortical capillaries is unclear, "I am not sure that this can explain brain fog," Nath told MedPage Today. "That would be a big stretch. All the patients in this paper had other comorbidities, so I'm not sure if that may have contributed to the process."

What SARS-CoV-2 does in the brain is "still a big mystery," Nauen said. "If you don't have viral encephalitis and you don't have inflammation in a conventional sense in the cortex, why are people with coronavirus experiencing symptoms we would associate with cortical disturbance in thought? Without the virus being present in the brain, without classic inflammation being present, maybe it's the oxygen delivery," he suggested. "So then the question is, what else has changed in the brain?"

"Evidence suggests brain involvement in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Manifestations in acutely ill individuals often include confusion and alteration of consciousness. After this phase, many patients experience continued neurologic symptoms such as dysexecutive syndrome (1) or "brain fog" (2). However, in autopsies from patients with COVID-19 who had neurologic abnormalities (reviewed in the study by Mukerji and Solomon [3]), investigations have largely not identified the chronic inflammation or marked neural changes typically associated with viral infection, and viral genetic material has been minimal or absent. It has been difficult to reconcile the experience of patients and clinicians that COVID-19 is altering cognition with tissue studies that show no evidence of encephalitis involving higher brain centers. We hypothesized that histopathology might provide insight. We report here a finding that may contribute in some cases, identified by analysis of brain tissue from patients who died of COVID-19.

"Methods: ...We evaluated brain tissue from autopsies of patients with nucleic acid-proven severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and confirmed pulmonary pathology.... At autopsy, the cranium was opened with hand tools or a saw with a vacuum shroud to prevent aerosolization. Brains were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, 10%, for 2 weeks, then grossly examined and sectioned for microscopic assessment.

"Results: In 5 cases (Table) in cortical capillaries, we identified large cell nuclei morphologically consistent with megakaryocytes (Figure, A). To further characterize these cells, we performed immunohistochemistry for CD61 and CD42b, markers of platelets and megakaryocytes. CD61 labels these cells (Figure, B), as does CD42b (Figure, C), confirming their megakaryocyte identity. The cells were distinct from platelet clusters, which were found in postmortem intravascular precipitates (Figure, D). Evaluation of the cortex of 2 patients who tested negative for COVID-19 who had hypoxic brain changes demonstrated no megakaryocytes on CD61.

"Discussion: Prior to this pandemic, the study neuropathologists (DWN and IHS) had not seen megakaryocytes in brain vessels, and we find no reference to this in the literature. A recent report showed these cells in an infarcted brain in COVID-19 (4), suggesting they could have been present in the brain circulation and entered the parenchyma during hemorrhage.

"Multiple lines of evidence indicate endothelial dysfunction may contribute to severe COVID-19 illness. Lung examination demonstrates megakaryocytes (5), and the cells have now been reported in other organs (6). One possibility is that altered endothelial or other signaling is recruiting megakaryocytes into the circulation and somehow permitting them to pass through the lungs. Although this initial study does not investigate mechanism, it is notable that we found megakaryocytes in cortical capillaries in 33% of cases examined. Because the standard brain autopsy sections taken sampled at random only a minute portion of the cortical volume, finding these cells suggests the total burden could be considerable. By occluding flow through individual capillaries, these large cells could cause ischemic alteration in a distinct pattern, potentially resulting in an atypical form of neurologic impairment."

Many people who have recovered from COVID-19 have reported short-term memory loss, confusion, and an inability to concentrate. This paper proposes that the cause may be megakaryocytes in the brain. Others have proposed a large-scale immune response induced by the virus, which in turn can cause a cytokine storm. The cytokine storm destroys cells and causes damage in the body, including to the brain. Memory loss and inability to concentrate has been reported as a pervasive problem in approximately 30% of recovered patients. Even people who had mild symptoms have reported these neurological issues. A paper published, reported below, found these individuals with post-COVID symptoms had "persistent inflammation and high levels of cytokines in their cerebrospinal fluid, which explained the symptoms they were having." - Mod.LK]

[B] Inflammatory leptomeningeal cytokines mediate COVID-19 neurologic symptoms
Date: Mon 8 Feb 2021

[See Remsik J, Wilcox JA, Babady NE, et al. Inflammatory leptomeningeal cytokines mediate COVID-19 neurologic symptoms in cancer patients. Cancer Cell. 2021; 39: 1-8. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2021.01.007
This paper is discussed in this EurekAlert news report. - Mod.LK]

One of the dozens of unusual symptoms that have emerged in COVID-19 patients is a condition that's informally called "COVID brain" or "brain fog." It's characterized by confusion, headaches, and loss of short-term memory. In severe cases, it can lead to psychosis and even seizures. It usually emerges weeks after someone first becomes sick with COVID-19. The medical term for COVID brain is encephalopathy.

When the MSK [Memorial Sloan Kettering] team first began studying COVID brain, though, they didn't know that cytokines were the cause. They first suspected that the virus itself was having an effect on the brain. The study in the Cancer Cell paper focused on 18 patients who were hospitalized at MSK with COVID-19 and were experiencing severe neurologic problems. The patients were given a full neurology workup, including brain scans like MRIs and CTs and electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring, to try to find the cause of their delirium. When nothing was found in the scans that would explain their condition, the researchers thought the answer might lie in the cerebrospinal fluid.

MSK's microbiology team devised a test to detect the COVID-19 virus in the fluid. Thirteen of the 18 patients had spinal taps to look for the virus, but it was not found. At that point, the rest of the fluid was taken to the lab of MSK physician-scientist Adrienne Boire for further study.

Jan Remsik, a research fellow in Dr. Boire's lab in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program and the paper's other 1st author, led the analysis of the fluid. "We found that these patients had persistent inflammation and high levels of cytokines in their cerebrospinal fluid, which explained the symptoms they were having," Dr. Remsik says. He adds that some smaller case studies with only a few patients had reported similar findings, but this study is the largest one so far to look at this effect.

"We used to think that the nervous system was an immune-privileged organ, meaning that it didn't have any kind of relationship at all with the immune system," Dr. Boire says. "But the more we look, the more we find connections between the 2." One focus of Dr. Boire's lab is studying how immune cells are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter this space, an area of research that's also important for learning how cancer cells are able to spread from other parts of the body to the brain.

"One thing that was really unique about Jan's approach is that he was able to do a really broad molecular screen to learn what was going on," Dr. Boire adds. "He took the tools that we use in cancer biology and applied them to COVID-19."

The inflammatory markers found in the COVID-19 patients were similar, but not identical, to those seen in people who have received CAR T-cell therapy [Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (also known as CAR T cells) are T cells that have been genetically engineered to produce an artificial T-cell receptor for use in immunotherapy (Wikipedia); they are designed to recognize and direct an immune response against cells that display a specific antigen. - Mod.LK]. And as with CAR T-cell therapy, the neurologic effects are sometimes delayed.

The initial inflammatory response with CAR T-cell treatment is very similar to the reaction called cytokine storm that's often reported in people with COVID-19, Dr. Wilcox explains. With both COVID-19 and CAR T-cell therapy, the neurologic effects come days or weeks later. In CAR T-cell patients, neurologic symptoms are treated with steroids, but doctors don't yet know the role of anti-inflammatory treatments for people with neurologic symptoms of COVID-19. "Many of them are already getting steroids, and it's possible they may be benefitting," Dr. Wilcox says.

[3] USA: 1st month vaccine safety monitoring
Date: Fri 19 Feb 2021
Source: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) [abridged, edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7008e3.htm?s_cid=mm7008e3_w


Citation: Gee J, Marquez P, Su J, et al. First month of COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring -- United States, December 14, 2020-January 13, 2021. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. Epub 19 Feb 2021. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7008e3

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Two COVID-19 vaccines have received Emergency Use Authorization for administration in the USA. In preauthorization clinical trials, local and systemic reactions were reported; no serious safety problems were detected.

What is added by this report?
Monitoring, conducted as part of the US vaccination program, indicates reassuring safety profiles for COVID-19 vaccines. Local and systemic reactions were common; rare reports of anaphylaxis were received. No unusual or unexpected reporting patterns were detected.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Healthcare providers and vaccine recipients can be reassured about the safety of Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. Counseling vaccine recipients to expect transient local and systemic reactions might ease concerns and encourage completion of the 2-dose vaccination series.

---
Two coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines are currently authorized for use in the USA. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on 11 Dec 2020 and for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine on 18 Dec 2020; each is administered as a 2-dose series. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices issued interim recommendations for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines on 12 Dec 2020 (1 [see source URL for complete references, tables, and figures]), and 19 Dec 2020 (2), respectively; initial doses were recommended for healthcare personnel and long-term care facility (LTCF) residents (3). Safety monitoring for these vaccines has been the most intense and comprehensive in US history, using the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a spontaneous reporting system, and v-safe (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html), an active surveillance system, during the initial implementation phases of the COVID-19 national vaccination program (4).

CDC conducted descriptive analyses of safety data from the 1st month of vaccination (14 Dec 2020-13 Jan 2021). During this period, 13 794 904 vaccine doses were administered, and VAERS received and processed (processed VAERS reports are those that have been MedDRA-coded, been deduplicated, and undergone quality assurance and quality control) 6994 reports of adverse events after vaccination, including 6354 (90.8%) that were classified as nonserious and 640 (9.2%) as serious (a serious adverse event is defined as occurring if one of the following is reported: death, life-threatening illness, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, permanent disability, congenital anomaly, or birth defect; https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr).

The symptoms most frequently reported to VAERS were headache (22.4%), fatigue (16.5%), and dizziness (16.5%). A total of 113 deaths were reported to VAERS, including 78 (65%) among LTCF residents; available information from death certificates, autopsy reports, medical records, and clinical descriptions from VAERS reports and healthcare providers did not suggest any causal relationship between COVID-19 vaccination and death. Rare cases of anaphylaxis after receipt of both vaccines were reported (4.5 reported cases per million doses administered). Among persons who received Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reactions reported to the v-safe system were more frequent after receipt of the 2nd dose than after the 1st. The initial post-authorization safety profiles of the 2 COVID-19 vaccines in current use did not indicate evidence of unexpected serious adverse events. These data provide reassurance and helpful information regarding what healthcare providers and vaccine recipients might expect after vaccination.

During 14 Dec 2020-13 Jan 2021, a total of 13 794 904 COVID-19 vaccine doses were administered in the USA; 8 436 863 (61.2%) doses were administered to women. VAERS received 6994 reports of COVID-19-associated adverse events during this period. Among all reports, 6354 (90.8%) were classified as nonserious and 640 (9.2%) as serious, including 113 (1.6%) deaths. The median age of vaccine recipients in VAERS reports was 42 years (range = 15-104 years); 5505 (78.7%) reports were submitted for adverse events in women. Headache (22.4%), fatigue (16.5%), and dizziness (16.5%) were the most frequently reported symptoms after vaccination with either vaccine (Table 1). Also, 62 reports of anaphylaxis have been confirmed, 46 (74.2%) after receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 16 (25.8%) after receipt of the Moderna vaccine.

VAERS reports involving non-LTCF residents
Among the 6994 VAERS reports received and processed, 6844 (97.9%) involved persons not residing in LTCFs; among these, 5533 (80.8%) received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 1311 (19.2%) received the Moderna vaccine. Most reports concerned women (5413; 79.1%), and the median age of persons reporting adverse events was 42 years (range = 15-96 years).

The most frequently reported symptoms were headache (1564; 22.9%), dizziness (1149; 16.8%), and fatigue (1147; 16.8%). Among these reports, 6326 (92.4%) were classified as nonserious. Included among the 518 (7.6%) serious reports were 35 reports of death: 16 (45.7%) after the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 19 (54.3%) after the Moderna vaccine. Decedents ranged in age from 25 to 91 years (median = 62 years); 15 (42.9%) were women. The median interval from vaccination to death was 3 days (range = 0-20 days). Among 19 persons whose deaths were reported to VAERS after receiving COVID-19 vaccine, record collection and evaluation are ongoing; for the remaining 16 reported deaths, review of death certificates or other data indicated underlying heart disease, cancer, stroke, probable pulmonary embolism, and otherwise frail health as the cause of death.

VAERS reports involving LTCF residents
Among residents of LTCFs who received COVID-19 vaccine, 150 (2.1%) reports of adverse events were submitted to VAERS, including 88 (58.7%) after receipt of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and 62 (41.3%) after receipt of the Moderna vaccine. The median vaccine recipient age was 83 years (range = 17-104 years), and 92 (61%) reports concerned women.

Among 122 (81.3%) reports of serious adverse events in LTCF residents, 78 (52.0%) deaths have been reported and investigated; 42 (53.8%) occurred in residents in hospice care or with a do-not-resuscitate status. Death certificate data were available for 17 (22.0%) deaths; causes of death included cardiac disease, dementia, pneumonia, and failure to thrive. Nineteen (24.3%) reported deaths are currently awaiting additional records to establish cause of death. Reported deaths occurred 0-20 days after vaccination (median = 2 days).

v-safe Reports
During 24 Dec 2020-13 Jan 2021, v-safe enrolled 1 602 065 vaccine recipients who completed at least one survey; 814 648 (50.8%) received Pfizer-BioNTech and 787 417 (49.2%) received Moderna vaccines. The median recipient age was 46 years (range = 16-110 years); 1 106 656 (69.1%) were women. There were 10 825 (0.68%) enrollees who reported that they were pregnant at the time of vaccination, and 262 (0.02%) reported a positive pregnancy test result after vaccination.

Solicited local and systemic reactions were similar between persons receiving 1st doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. Injection site pain, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and chills were most frequently reported (Figure). Enrollees reported more reactions on the day after vaccination than on any other day. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, reactions were more frequent after the 2nd dose than the 1st; the reported rate of fever and chills was more than 4 times higher after the 2nd dose than after the 1st (Table 2).

Discussion
After administration of 13.8 million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to the US population during the 1st month of the vaccination program, the postauthorization safety profiles for both vaccines are reassuring. Most (90.9%) VAERS reports were for nonserious events and involved local and systemic symptoms; transient local and systemic reactions were also frequently reported in v-safe. Reports of anaphylaxis have been observed after administration of both vaccines (5). The occurrence of anaphylaxis after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines during the analytic period, 4.5 cases per million doses administered, is within the range reported after receipt of inactivated influenza vaccine (1.4 per million), pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (2.5 per million), and live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine (9.6 per million); effective treatments for anaphylaxis exist (6).

VAERS received 113 reports of death after COVID-19 vaccinations; two-thirds of these deaths occurred among LTCF residents. All-cause mortality is high in LTCF populations because underlying medical conditions are common. Based on expected rates of background mortality, among the approximately one million LTCF residents vaccinated in the 1st month of the US COVID-19 vaccination program, approximately 7000 coincidental, temporally associated deaths from all causes would be expected during the analytic period (7). In contrast, VAERS received 78 reports of death after COVID-19 vaccination in LTCF residents, and approximately one-half were in residents who were in hospice or who had a do-not-resuscitate status. Reported causes of death in LTCF residents after COVID-19 vaccination are consistent with expected all-cause mortality in this population. Among deaths in persons with available death certificate and autopsy information who were not LTCF residents, causes of death were consistent with background all-cause mortality and did not indicate any unexpected pattern that might suggest a causal relationship with vaccination (8).

Findings from v-safe monitoring for both vaccines indicate substantial reactogenicity. More reactogenicity was reported after the 2nd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech than the 1st, particularly on the day after vaccination (data on 2nd dose of Moderna vaccine were not available because of later availability and the dosing interval). These findings are similar to those from clinical trials from both manufacturers, in which injection site pain, fatigue, headache, and myalgia were most frequently reported, with a higher frequency after the 2nd dose in comparable age-groups (9,10). V-safe's rapid collection of experiences from vaccinated persons provides valuable information that healthcare providers can use to counsel vaccine recipients about common reactions and what to expect after vaccination (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html). V-safe will be able to provide information on vaccination during pregnancy through follow-up in the v-safe pregnancy registry.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 3 limitations. First, VAERS analyses are based on passive surveillance, and reporting biases are possible, both from underreporting because of lack of awareness or compliance with reporting requirements as well as from stimulated reporting related to increased awareness. Second, LTCF residents might have been undercounted because the search strategy for identifying LTCF residents relied primarily on vaccination facility documentation. Because of challenges in distinguishing LTCF staff members from LTCF residents aged 65 years or younger, only serious VAERS reports were reviewed among those aged 65 years or younger who were vaccinated in LTCFs. Finally, v-safe is a voluntary self-enrollment program requiring smartphone access, and all vaccination locations might not have offered equal access to v-safe enrollment materials to vaccine recipients; therefore, information from v-safe might not be representative or generalizable.

Mass vaccination with highly effective vaccines is critical to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the speed of COVID-19 vaccine development and deployment, there have been concerns among the public about the safety of these new vaccines. In response to these concerns, the US government has implemented the most comprehensive vaccine safety monitoring program in its history. Cases of anaphylaxis after receipt of both authorized vaccines have been observed, though rarely; anaphylaxis rates are comparable with those reported after receipt of other vaccines. No unexpected patterns of reactions or other safety concerns have been identified during early monitoring. CDC and FDA will continue to monitor the safety of COVID-19 vaccines to inform vaccination policy and to maintain public confidence.

Adverse events that occur after COVID-19 vaccination should be reported to VAERS. Providers are encouraged to promote v-safe enrollment and are required under EUA to report to VAERS vaccination administration errors, serious adverse events, cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death after COVID-19 vaccination (https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html). These initial findings should provide reassurance to healthcare providers and to vaccine recipients and promote confidence in the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

[The 1st month's reports following almost 14 million doses administered are very promising vis a vis the safety of the mRNA vaccines (as a reminder, both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA platforms). If there are serious side effects, they are most likely occurring at a very low rate. We will be following these reports as they become available. It will also be interesting to see results of studies looking at the possibility of PEG (polyethylene glycol) being the allergic antigen triggering the anaphylactic reactions reported. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (80 289), Brazil (51 067), and France (24 116) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 11 245 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 18 Feb 2021 to late 19 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (10 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Italy (15 470), India (14 587), Russia (13 433), UK (12 027), Czech Republic (11 705), Spain (11 435), and Indonesia (10 614). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 48 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.1%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 16.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 28.9% decrease in daily reported cases and 30.2% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments -- the global daily reported cases totaled over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 111.23 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.46 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. - Mod.MPP]
