Leptospirosis, commonly known as rat-bite fever [sic], has claimed 78
lives this year [2011] with most of the victims being farmers and
children.

According to the Health Ministry's Epidemiology Unit the majority of
the total 5930 cases are reported from Kurunegala, Gampaha, Kalurata
[?Kalutara] and Hambantota districts where paddy and other
agricultural crop cultivation are the main source of income.

Most people get rat-bite fever through contact with urine or
secretions from the mouth, eye, or nose of an infected animal [sic].
This most commonly occurs through a bite, yet some cases may occur
simply through contact with these secretions [sic].

The source of the infection is usually a rat. Other animals that may
cause infection include squirrels, weasels and sometimes cats, dogs,
pigs and cattle. Local agricultural practices, poor housing and waste
disposal are main causes for the increase in the infection.

Symptoms may vary from a mild flu-like illness to a serious and
sometimes fatal disease. Jaundice is a relatively common symptom in
leptospirosis. One should seek immediate medical care with the abrupt
onset of fever, chills, headache, muscle tenderness (notable in calf
and lumbar areas), and jaundice. If not treated the patient may die of
renal failure, heart failure and widespread haemorrhage.

[Kurunegala District is located in the North Western Province of Sri
Lanka; Gampaha District is located along the western coast in the
Western Province, north of Colombo; Kalutara District is located on
the western coast in Western Province, south of Colombo; and
Hambantota District is located along the southern coast in the
Southern Province of Sri Lanka. The districts of Sri Lanka can be

This news article above has confused leptospirosis, also known as rat
fever, with rat-bite fever (RBF). RBF is an infectious disease caused
by either _Streptobacillus moniliformis_ in North America or by
_Spirillum minus_ mainly in Asia. People usually get RBF from bites of
infected rodents or consumption of contaminated food or water.
Leptospirosis is very rarely caused by the bite of an infected rat
(http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/content/57/5/658.full), in which case
the biting rat would have to have acute and generalized infection to
allow salivary transmission.

Leptospirosis is usually transmitted to humans by exposure, either by
direct contact or through contaminated wet soil, vegetation, or water,
with the urine of animals that are mostly asymptomatic, but
chronically infected with to one of the several hundred serovars of
the spirochete _Leptospira interrogans_. Rodents, dogs, cattle, and
pigs are the usual reservoirs for this organism.

Leptospirosis occurs worldwide and is endemic in Sri Lanka.
Leptospirosis frequently occurs during periods of flooding after heavy
rains; but has occurred in Sri Lanka during a period of severe
drought, when it has been attributed to exposure to
_Leptospira_-contaminated water in a network of thousands of man-made
reservoirs, known locally as 'tanks,' that are used for preserving the
rainfall primarily for agriculture and drinking water, but also for
sacred bathing (see ProMED-mail Leptospirosis, fatal - Sri Lanka (02):
(NW) 20110913.2785).

How the diagnosis was made is not mentioned in the news release.
Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical
presentation of leptospirosis, the diagnosis of leptospirosis cannot
be made confidently without laboratory confirmation. Consequently,
leptospirosis is probably under-diagnosed.

Reported rates of leptospirosis have increased dramatically since 2006
in Sri Lanka, where 20.3 percent of cattle and 17.5 percent of rodents
are infected. People at greatest risk for acquiring the disease in Sri
Lanka are reported to be paddy farmers and sugar cane plantation
workers. (See ProMED-mail Leptospirosis, fatal - Sri Lanka (03): (NW)
