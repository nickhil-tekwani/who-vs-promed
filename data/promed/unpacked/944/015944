Cases of legionnaires' disease associated with Paris, August 1999
Three cases of legionellosis, all residents of the same district of Paris
(arrondissement XV), were notified to the French National Institute for
Public Health Surveillance (Institut de Veille Sanitaire (InVS)) on 1
September 1999. On 27 August the European Working Group on Legionella
Infections (EWGLI) notified the InVS of a British traveller who had stayed
in a hotel in the same area at the beginning of August and subsequently
developed legionellosis. These notifications by two independent systems
suggested an outbreak in people who had visited XV district of Paris.
For the purposes of epidemiological investigation a case was defined as a
person who developed pneumonia in August 1999 having resided in or visited
the XVth and neighbouring districts of Paris in the ten days before onset,
associated with either a positive _Legionella pneumophila_ urinary antigen
test and/or the isolation of _L. pneumophila_ in respiratory secretions
and/or a fourfold rise in specific serum antibody titre.
An active search of cases initiated through the district public health
officers, the National Reference Centre, hospitals in the Paris area, and
the EWGLI network identified four further cases. All cases (or their close
relations) were interviewed in detail about their activities during the
incubation period, using a standardised questionnaire.
All eight cases had stayed in a small area of the XVth arrondissement of
Paris, near Montparnasse. One patient died (aged 42 years). Dates of onset
ranged from 8 to 20 August. Seven patients were men, aged 42 to 78 years
(median 54). Seven patients were residents of France. Six cases were
confirmed by the detection of urinary antigen and two by culture of _L.
pneumophila_ serogroup 1. The two isolates had indistinguishable and unique
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis profiles. No specific common exposure was
identified (hotel, bars, restaurant, shopping centre, etc). Exposure to the
same area of the XVth arrondissement and the absence of any other potential
source led us to investigate the possibility of contamination by cooling
towers. Selected cooling towers to which patients may have been exposed in
August have been investigated intensively by the Direction des Affaires
Sanitaires et Sociales of Paris. No further cases with dates of onset since
20 August have been notified, but intensified surveillance is continuing in
France and through the EWGLI network. Owners of all the cooling towers in
the suspected area have been requested to disinfect their installations.
We thank the EWGLI correspondents, the French practitioners, and the public
health officers for their collaboration.
