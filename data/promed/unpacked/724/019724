Seven people have fallen ill from an outbreak of _E. coli_ poisoning in
Oklahoma, most of them children, health authorities said Monday. Six of the
confirmed cases were traced to unpasteurized apple cider marketed in the
Tulsa area, officials said.

Five children fell ill last week, and two cases have since been confirmed,
said Dr. Mike Crutcher, state epidemiologist with the Oklahoma Health
Department. One was an adult who drank cider from Livesay Orchards, as did
five children who became ill, authorities said. The other was a 13-year-old
girl, and authorities are unsure how she may have been poisoned. She
remained hospitalized Monday in fair condition, as did a 4-year-old girl in
serious condition with kidney failure, an 11-year-old boy
in serious condition and a 6-year-old boy in fair condition. Authorities
did not release any information on the adult.

The dangerous strain of _E. coli_ is usually found in the intestines or
manure of cattle. People who ingest it can suffer severe cramps, bloody
diarrhea and, in extreme cases, kidney failure.

Ken Livesay, co-owner of Livesay Orchards, said last week that the outbreak
is the first suspicion of any problem in nearly 20 years of making cider.
