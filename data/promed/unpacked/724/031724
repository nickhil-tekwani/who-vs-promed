China: 1st human avian influenza case since July 2006
-----------------------------------------------
A 37-year-old farmer in eastern China has been confirmed to have
contracted the H5N1 strain of bird flu, the country's 1st human case
of avian influenza in months, the Health News said on Wed 10 Jan
2007. The country has reported a total of 22 human cases of bird flu,
including 14 fatalities, since 2003.
In the latest case, a man developed symptoms of fever and pneumonia
on 10 Dec 2006 and was discharged from hospital on Sat [6 Jan 2007]
in Tunxi in Anhui province after a full recovery, the Health News said.
The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed on
Mon 8 Jan 2007 that he had tested positive for the deadly H5N1
strain, the Health Ministry-run newspaper said. People who have had
close contact with him were quarantined for medical observation until
29 Dec 2006, it added. There have been no bird flu outbreaks in
poultry in the area, the Health News said.
China last reported a human case of bird flu in July 2006, when a
farmer died of H5N1 in the northwestern region in Xinjiang.

China: Human H5N1 avian influenza case confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A Chinese farmer has contracted the H5N1 strain of avian influenza,
the country's 1st human case in months, leading to questions about
whether the virus is circulating undetected among poultry. The
37-year-old man from the eastern province of Anhui kept backyard
birds, but as in other human bird flu cases in China, there was no
reported poultry outbreak in the area, raising questions as to how he
contracted the virus. "In China, the challenge is now to identify
where this virus is hiding and how it is circulating," Henk Bekedam,
the World Health Organization's China representative, told Reuters.
The country has reported a total of 22 human cases of bird flu,
including 14 fatalities, since 2003, and with the world's largest
poultry population and millions of backyard birds roaming free, it is
seen as a center in the fight against the virus. Bekedam said that as
vaccination rates for birds improve in China, detecting avian
influenza becomes harder and harder, offering a possible explanation
for why there was no reported outbreak where the man lived. "It's not
to say that the virus is not somehow still circulating, but that the
detection of that circulating virus has become far more difficult
because of the active engagement of the government in avian influenza
control," he said.
The man developed symptoms of fever and pneumonia on 10 Dec 2006 and
was discharged from hospital on Saturday [6 Jan 2007] in Tunxi in
Anhui province after a full recovery, Health News, the Health
Ministry-run newspaper, said. The Chinese Center for Disease Control
and Prevention confirmed on Monday [8 Jan 2007] that he had tested
positive for the deadly H5N1 strain, which scientists fear could
mutate into a form that can be passed easily between people, leading
to a potential pandemic. People who have had close contact with the
man were quarantined for medical observation until 20 Dec 2006, the
Health News said, but there was no indication that others in the area
had taken ill. Bekedam said the WHO was still investigating whether
any of the man's birds had been sick, adding that it was possible
that they carried H5N1 but did not display any symptoms.
China has in the past been criticized for a lack of transparency in
its handling of health threats, but Bekedam said the WHO was informed
of the case as soon as he tested positive, and WHO praised the fact
that he was tested a 2nd time after his 1st tests turned up negative.
"We think it's very encouraging that there seem to be some routine
mechanisms in place to determine whether someone is suffering from
avian influenza or not, and it doesn't stop after the 1st negative
test," he said.
China last reported a human case of bird flu in July 2006, when a
farmer died of H5N1 in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. The most
recent reported poultry outbreaks were in early October 2006 in the
regions of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia.

[Although the source of the avian influenza virus infecting the
farmer in Anhui province remains obscure, it is clear from the
complete recovery of the patient and the lack of secondary cases that
this particular virus has not evolved any potential for
person-to-person transmission.
The map of Chinese provinces available at
<http://www.invasive.org/hwa/images/Map%20China%20Province_%20coll%20sites.jpg>
shows that Anhui province, the site of the latest case, and Xinjiang
province, the site of the most recent previous case, are
geographically far apart. - Mod.CP]
