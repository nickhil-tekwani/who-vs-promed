re: ProMED-mail Hantavirus - Americas (59): Bolivia (LP) 20181023.6107497
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We fully agree with the moderator that more details would be extremely welcome on a) camping conditions/localization, b) symptoms of involved cases, and c) determination of causative hantavirus (and consequently the most probable involved rodent reservoir), to better understand why an impressive total of 19 military hantavirus infection cases could develop in a relatively short period, and this only from the Joint Task Force (JTF) camps in the La Asunta municipality in La Paz department:

a) This military outbreak is highly reminiscent of the 1st described Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) outbreak in Germany, occurring in January 1990, near the city of Ulm (south Germany). This hantavirus outbreak was remarkable, since it pertained not at all to the local civilian German population, but only to US troops camping under tents near the Danube river for winter NATO maneuvers. The bivouac site appeared (later) infested with wild mice (bank voles), and many burrows were seen under and between the tents. During the following 2 weeks, a total of 16 cases were notified, thus representing then the largest recorded hantavirus cluster noted so far among military US personnel abroad. Of these, 14 had to be hospitalised with nausea plus vomiting, and varying degrees of AKI (acute kidney injury) (peak serum creatinine range 1.2 to 7.0 mg%). All survived eventually without sequelae. All cases except one originated from a single 177-member military unit, including the 7 female cases, and resulting in an astonishing attack rate of 8.5 percent. All showed elevated IFA [immunofluorescence] IgG titers against Puumala (PUU) virus, which is the most common etiologic agent of hantavirus disease in Europe, carried primarily by red bank voles [_Myodes glareolus_]. Recent infection was confirmed by positive mu-capture anti-PUUV IgM ELISA results. A pioneer hantavirus case-control study was started in other units deployed in the same area, prompting the detection of an additional 8 IgM-positive subclinical cases. Comparing questionnaires of 23 cases vs. 575 (serologically negative) non-cases, "sighting of rodents" appeared the most significant risk factor for incurring a then emerging infection, and constituting a novel proven risk for military operations. See: Clement J, Underwood P, Ward D, et al. Hantavirus outbreak during military manoeuvres in Germany. Lancet 1996; 347(8997): 336; https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(96)90519-X.pdf

b) Acute pulmonary symptoms, such as in so-called hantavirus cardio-pulmonary syndrome (HCPS), need not necessarily be caused only by New World hantavirus species, such as in Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) in North America, or by Andes hantavirus (ANDV) in South America. Non-cardiogenic acute pulmonary edema, even in life-threatening forms undistinguishable from "classical" HCPS, can also rarely occur in infections caused by Old World hantaviruses, such as PUUV (See: Vollmar P, Lubnow M, Simon M, et al. Hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome due to Puumala virus in Germany. J Clin Virol. 2016; 84: 42-7. doi: 10.1016/j.jcv.2016.10.004; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653216305492), or such as Dobrava hantavirus or DOBV (See: Schutt M, Meisel H, Kruger DH, et al. Life-threatening Dobrava hantavirus infection with unusually extended pulmonary involvement. Clin Nephrol. 2004; 62(1): 54-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/15267014/ and Dreshaj S, Ajazaj L, Hasani N, et al. A nonfatal case of Dobrava hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome combined with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. J Global Infect Dis 2018; 10(1): 22-5. doi: 10.4103/jgid.jgid_12_17; http://www.jgid.org/text.asp?2018/10/1/22/225863). Moreover, serious HCPS forms do exist also in rat-transmitted Seoul virus (SEOV) -induced human infections, even with fatal outcome (See: Roig IL, Musher DM, Tweardy DJ. Severe pulmonary involvement in a case attributed to domestically acquired Seoul hantavirus in the United States. Clin Infect Dis. 2012; 54(1): 91-4. doi: 10.1093/cid/cir748; http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/1/91.long), or in SEOV infections, complicated with lung edema, so severe as to require ventilatory support for 38 consecutive days (See: Taori SK, Jameson LJ, Campbell A. UK hantavirus, renal failure, and pet rats. Lancet. 2013; 381(9871): 1070. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60599-1; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60599-1/fulltext). In all cited reports above, the HCPS picture was presenting, in fact together and concomitant, with a picture of "hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome" (HFRS), thus questioning again the appropriateness of naming emerging infections only after "syndromes" (often incomplete or even lacking), instead of after causative agents, as advocated in: Clement J, Maes P, Van Ranst M. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in the New, and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the Old World: paradi(se)gm lost or regained? Virus Res. 2014; 17; 187: 55-8. doi: 10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.036; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168170213004826.

c) Although the treatment, even in intensive care units (ICU), is exactly the same, that is, only supportive, careful determination of the exact nature of the infective hantavirus species remains mandatory, be it "only" for epidemiological and virological reasons. Another military case of severe combined "HFRS with HCPS", needing urgency air transport during the Bosnian War to a London ICU facility, was originally considered to be SEOV-induced, see: Stuart LM, Rice PS, Lloyd G, Beale RJ. A soldier in respiratory distress. Lancet. 1996; 347(8993): 30. However, after verification on the remaining serum sample years later, it turned out to be in fact DOBV-induced, which is another murine pathogen, genetically closely related to SEOV, as admitted in: Clement J, Maes P, Saegeman V, et al. Comment on "A cluster of three cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome among Canadian military personnel." Can J Inf Dis Med Microbiol 2016: ID 7458409. doi: 10.1155/2016/7458409; http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/7458409. Of note, since rat-transmitted SEOV is the only (but heavily under-recognized) Old World hantaviral pathogen present throughout the New World, SEOV-infections in the Americas are always to be excluded, even if presenting with a HCPS picture, as was the case with the 2 1st hantavirus infection cases reported from Peru, presenting with "HFRS plus HCPS", but proven in RT-PCR to be in fact SEOV-induced, see: Garcia PM, Percy S, Herrera AL, et al. [Etiologic confirmation of the first two cases of human hantavirosis in Peru]. Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica. 2011; 28(3): 566-7; https://scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1726-46342011000300027&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en (in Spanish). Indeed, using for this diagnostic purpose exclusively commercial assays (mostly ELISA) is unreliable, since many of these assays contain only antigens having weak or no cross-reactivity with the murine SEOV, such as the European arvicoline PUUV, or the American sigmodontine SNV/ANDV.

[Clusters of cases of hantavirus infections, like the one in Bolivia, are unusual in the Americas. Just one cluster of cases has been reported in North America. There was a cluster of cases in Yosemite National Park, California in 2012, when 10 confirmed patients came from 3 states: California (8), West Virginia (1), and Pennsylvania (1). Of these, 9 patients had typical symptoms of HPS, and one lacked respiratory symptoms; 3 died. These individuals were exposed in a permanent campsite in the park where the deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) were living between the walls of double-walled tents (see Hantavirus update 2012 - Americas (38): USA (CA) 20121121.1418786).

ProMED thanks Dr Clement for his insightful overview and discussion of hantavirus cases in Europe and the Americas. His point of naming infections for the virus that causes them rather than the syndromes they cause is well taken. Inclusion of Seoul virus in diagnostic tests for suspected hantavirus infections around the world, including the Americas, should be adopted routinely. - Mod.TY
