Epidemiological Situation
------------------------
The epidemiological situation of the Ebola Virus Disease dated 6 Jul 2018:
- A total of 53 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 38 were confirmed and 15 were probable.
- 24 people have been cured of Ebola virus disease since the beginning of the epidemic.
29 deaths were recorded, including 14 confirmed cases.

News from the Ebola response
------------------------------
Strategic Review of the Response

From 3-5 Jul 2018, the Ministry of Health, together with the partners, conducted a strategic review of the response to assess the current epidemiological situation, assess the progress of the response, and identify essential surveillance activities to be pursued in the affected areas.

During the strategic review, the technical experts from the Ministry of Health and the various agencies involved in the response presented the Minister with the next steps, namely:
- A 21-day disengagement plan that aims to gradually reduce activities and staffing in affected areas while maintaining an optimal level of surveillance until the declaration of the end of the Ebola outbreak.
- A plan to stabilize and consolidate gains of 3 months from the end of the Ebola epidemic, which aims to draw lessons from the response and identify future prospects. This phase will be closed by the review after action.
- A 3-month resilience plan aimed at strengthening the capacity of the Congolese health system to monitor, detect and respond more effectively to long-term epidemics.

The main factor contributing to the good results achieved in the response is the alignment of all partners around a single response plan under the leadership of the Ministry of Health. It is important to maintain this alignment of all actors to ensure the success of the next steps.

National Association of Ebola Winners (ANVE)
----------------------------------
On Fri 6 and Sat 7 Jul 2018, the Ministry of Health and WHO are organizing a workshop for the implementation of the Ebola Healing Program in Mbandaka. During the 9th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 24 people were cured with adequate care. During their recovery period, people who are cured of Ebola need medical, psychological and social care to start their new life. It is in this context that the National Association of Ebola Winners was created to meet their specific needs.

The workshop aims to define a structured and integrated program of clinical and psychological follow-up for people cured of Ebola. This program includes 3 areas: medical follow-up, sperm testing and counseling, and psychosocial support. Planned activities include neurological monitoring, psychological assessment, counseling for the prevention of sexual transmission of the virus, fertility and pregnancy monitoring for women, as well as assessment of social status and stigma.

In addition to the representatives of the Ministry of Health and WHO, representatives of ANVE, INRB, ALIMA, MSF and UNICEF were also invited to participate in the workshop.

- WHO: outbreak largely contained
Date: Fri 6 Jul 2018

Ebola outbreak in DR Congo likely over; no case for 21 days but 42 days must pass before it is officially over
------------------------------------
Ebola virus outbreak likely over in Congo, WHO says.
No new cases have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 3 weeks.

The outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is probably over, with no new cases reported for 3 weeks, the World Health Organization said Fri [6 Jul 2018].

WHO called the outbreak "largely contained." But it's too soon to declare the outbreak fully ended because it's possible someone has been infected and has not started showing symptoms yet, the WHO said.

WHO said 53 people had been infected with the virus, and 29 had died. The last confirmed case was treated and released on 12 Jun 2018.

No one appears to have carried the virus out of the country, and WHO is lowering the risk advisory to neighboring countries. The risk of wider export out of the region was never considered high.

"In the absence of ongoing transmission, the probability of exported cases is low and diminishing," WHO said.

WHO said more than 3300 people had been given an experimental Ebola vaccine using a technique called ring vaccination, in which cases of the disease are tracked down, and all the people they have been in direct contact with are vaccinated. Then the contacts of those vaccinated people are tracked down and vaccinated. This method eradicated smallpox at the end of the 1970s.

This was the 9th outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Until this one, the outbreaks had been in remote regions and affected usually fewer than 100 people, although a 1995 outbreak sickened 315 people and killed 250 of them, and the 1st outbreak, in 1976, affected 318 people and killed 280.

Winning hearts and minds in the newest Ebola zone
---------------------------------
Health experts were worried about this outbreak because cases were seen in a large city, Mbandaka, which sits on the busy Congo River.

Urban outbreaks of Ebola are especially frightening. In 2014-2016, an epidemic of Ebola sickened more than 28 000 people and killed more than 11 000 of them in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. It spread explosively in both urban and rural regions.

Quick reaction probably helped contain this outbreak, experts said.

"However, there remains a risk of resurgence from potentially undetected transmission chains and possible sexual transmission of the virus by male survivors. It is, therefore, critical to maintain all key response pillars until the end of the outbreak is declared," WHO said.

"Before the outbreak can be declared over, a period of 42 days (2 incubation periods) following the last possible exposure to a confirmed case must elapse without any new confirmed cases being detected."

Ebola can pop up unexpectedly because it can survive in male semen for months after a man has recovered from an infection.

WHO also said it was helping the Congolese Ministry of Health to set up a year of care for Ebola survivors, who can suffer long-term symptoms.

[2] Response

- Batwa communities

An inclusive response: reaching Batwa communities to combat Ebola
---------------------------------------
Dr Bijoux Sambu Fiti is part of the surveillance team working in Itipo, a small community in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that has been battling Ebola since May 2018. Her job is to go deep into the forest around Itipo to seek out sick people in Batwa villages potentially suffering from undiagnosed cases of Ebola. The Batwa, which is the plural term for Twa people, are hunter-gatherers living primarily off the forest. Dr Sambu Fiti, who is from DRC herself, was keenly aware of the challenges she would face in engaging with a population so culturally different from the rest of the country.

In Itipo, 60% of the population is Batwa and 40% is Bantu.

"The Bantu have the same kind of culture, so it's very easy for another Congolese person to communicate with them," says Dr Sambu Fiti. "The Twa have a completely different culture. They shut off when they meet someone they don't know. There's a good chance they will just melt into the forest."

The Batwa people are often less inclined to visit state health centres, saying the cost of care is too high and that they sometimes do not feel welcome by the staff. This puts them at increased risk in the midst of an Ebola outbreak, where accessing care is one of the most important ways to prevent the spread and increase chances of surviving the virus.

Dr Sambu Fiti was able to locate Batwa villages by asking nurses at local health posts to identify the locations they knew traditional healers to be present. Next, she teamed up with a Bantu acquaintance whom the Batwa villagers had previously met. By going with someone they trusted, she hoped this would encourage them to talk to her and listen to her messages about protecting their health.

On entering each village, Dr Sambu Fiti introduced herself, explaining that she was a doctor and part of the Ebola response. She discovered that many people in the communities either did not know about Ebola or had only the slightest understanding of the disease.

For Dr Sambu Fiti, a key issue was whether the Batwa community would agree that any sick person she found could go to a clinic rather than stay in the community to be treated by a traditional healer using medicinal plants.

"They understood that Ebola is a disease that kills," she explains. "For them, there are certain times it's acceptable go to a hospital, and Ebola is one of those times." Healthcare was provided free-of-charge by the government in Ebola-affected areas, which has also helped people access care.

When Dr Sambu Fiti did come across a sick Batwa lady, she learned that she had previously given birth in a clinic and was comfortable with being admitted for tests. (She subsequently tested negative for Ebola).

Jose Maria Masanga is an anthropologist and WHO consultant, who is also from DRC. He works with the surveillance and risk communication teams in Itipo. As an anthropologist, he has played an important role in the response by analyzing the Batwa community's attitudes to the Ebola outbreak.

[This report on a local doctor seeking out individuals in the Batwa community with illness, highlights the difficulty of controlling Ebola in a remote and culturally distinct habitat. It was found that "many people in the communities either did not know about Ebola or had only the slightest understanding of the disease." Therefore, it would take an astute doctor to pick up a single Ebola case, or a cluster of cases, to set off the alarm. One has to wonder whether Ebola virus may circulate under the radar in such locations as Itipo, with no one noticing. - Mod.LK]

In northwestern DRC, the end of the Ebola outbreak is emerging. The authorities hope to declare it by 22 Jul 2018, the last suspected case being released from quarantine on 27 Jun 2018. However, for the healed, the situation is always difficult. They must face isolation and ostracism. Along with the World Food Program (WFP) and UNICEF, the NGO Oxfam distributes food for them until they return to normal life.

W is still affected by what she has experienced. Rescued from Ebola, she contracted the virus as part of her work as a nurse. To pass on the other side of the barrier was a test, with the pains, the fever, the treatment and above all the banishment of the society.

"My friends isolated me when I was sick. We love each other only when we are in shape, and if we are sick, friends abandon you, she explains. So, there are children at home; that's what I was able to do to try a little to get my daily life back."

W has not yet been allowed by her employer to return to work. In the meantime, she receives food from Oxfam. The NGO provides food to the sick as well as to those at risk in quarantine. But the purpose of this action is also social.

"There is a commission called psycho-social, which follows all those people affected for a certain reintegration into their ordinary environment, explained Olivier Makita, coordinator in Mbandaka. Through this food distribution activity, there is a household that said, for example, that it was the 1st time they had been able to receive family members and neighbors again. Because there was this contribution, the mother could do the meals, and the rest of the family came to eat."

Support is all the more important as the region is poor and rural. As Olivier Makita pointed out, the response to the virus is teamwork and is not limited to healing the sick.

[See ProMED-mail Ebola update (34): Congo DR, cases, response, WHO 20180613.5853602 for discussion of Oxfam's contribution to the Ebola response. Oxfam is distributing rice, beans and flour to about 4525 people. This is in addition to providing clean water and working with communities to ensure that they know how to protect themselves against the virus and prevent its spread.

Oxfam is providing door-to-door information to the most vulnerable people, working with communities, and carrying out mass awareness activities including film screenings and working with local community radio stations.

Oxfam is also installing chlorinated water points in hospitals, health centres, schools, and ports, and helping to disinfect houses in which Ebola cases have been detected. It also provides disinfection kits and hygiene kits to communities.

Oxfam has made a tremendous contribution to control of the DRC Ebola outbreak! - Mod.LK
