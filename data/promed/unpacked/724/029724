Hantavirus Infection In Chongqing (China) - Update
--------------------------------------------------
International SOS continues to follow the incidence of hantavirus infection
[manifested in its most severe form as hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome with the local Chinese health officials. To date, there is no
appreciable increase of cases over the usual number for this time of year
(i.e. autumn and early winter), which is the high season for hantavirus
infection [i.e. Hantaan virus in _Apodemus_ rodents in that region. All
cases reported have been in farmers and peasants, which fits the risk
profile for this disease.
At this time, vaccination need be considered only for persons at high risk
for exposure, such as wildlife biologists or persons involved in the
demolition of old buildings. Visitors to China may want to avoid rural
areas of high endemicity for the next 4-8 weeks, but the risk for
foreigners is low even in these regions. Further information can be
obtained from Dr. Charles van Reenen, Assistant Regional Medical Director
for China, International SOS, Beijing (email:

[As several hantaviruses are endemic in this region and there appears to be
little or no enhanced risk of human infection for travellers and
non-residents, this thread is cut for the present. - Mod.CP
