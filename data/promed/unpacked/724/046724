Comments on Rotavirus Epidemiology
----------------------------------
Rather than a reflection of poor standards of hygiene and sanitation, the
mortality resulting from rotavirus infection is probably due to poor health
status/nutrition and poor access to good health care; i.e., children are
less able to survive a bout of diarrhea.
Rotavirus is ubiquitous in both developing and developed countries, with
every child being infected by the age of 2-3 years, regardless of
hygiene/sanitation; as the moderator notes, the virus is extremely
resilient. However, the epidemiology differs.
In particular, children are infected at a younger age in tropical,
developing countries and have higher rates of mortality. The "scientific"
mortality rate quoted in the posting reflects US estimates (20 deaths
annually in children <5 years with a 4 million birth cohort), not those for
developing countries, where its is estimated that more than 600 000 deaths
due to rotavirus infection still occur (a rate of 1 in 10 000 total
population in the world!). Regardless, the underlying cause -- poor social
infrastructure -- is the same and still needs to be addressed.
