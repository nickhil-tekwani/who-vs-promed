Chikungunya in the Americas
---------------------------
[authors: Isabelle Leparc-Goffart, Antoine Nougairede, Sylvie Cassadou, Christine Prat, Xavier de Lamballerie]

On 5 Dec 2013, the French National Reference Centre for arboviruses confirmed autochthonous chikungunya cases on Saint Martin Island, French West Indies (appendix). On 20 Dec 2013, about 50 confirmed cases were reported with additional evidence for autochthonous transmission on Martinique island. In January 2014, autochthonous cases have been reported also from Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy, Dominica, and the British Virgin Islands.

_Aedes aegypti_ is the unique potential vector locally. The full-length viral RNA genome was characterised directly from the serum of 2 viraemic patients using next-generation sequencing methods. The virus does not belong to the ECSA genotype but to the Asian genotype, identified in late 1950s in southeast Asian countries. It is phylogenetically related to strains recently identified in Asia (in Indonesia in 2007, in China in 2012, and in the Philippines in 2013), most of them sharing a specific 4-amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene. The virus is only distantly related to the Asian genotype virus that recently circulated in New Caledonia, which harbours different amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene.

This episode represents the 1st evidence for the emergence of autochthonous chikungunya cases in the Americas. It is likely that the chikungunya epidemic will extend to other Caribbean islands, and it also has substantial potential for spreading from this region visited yearly by millions of tourists to the American mainland where _A. aegypti_ is endemic. Assuming that this strain will be transmitted efficiently by _A. albopictus_ mosquitoes, its persistence in the Caribbean would also represent, as a consequence of seasonal synchronicity, a great threat for southern European countries where the mosquito has recently dispersed. This situation warrants reinforced epidemiological surveillance and specific preparedness.

There are now a total of 13 confirmed cases of the mosquitoborne [virus] disease, chikungunya, in Dominica. Senior environmental health officer, Sylvester St Ville, made the announcement on state-owned DBS Radio on Friday [7 Feb 2014] and said the matter is disturbing. "It's a major concern for the health care system, but it's something that we are trying to manage," he said. "As of our latest report, there are 13 confirmed cases." He said the cases are mainly in the Woodfordhill and Bath Estate areas. "They are confined to those 2 communities," he remarked.

St Ville pointed out that the environmental health department is currently undertaking preventative measures to reduce the spread the disease. "Presently we are in Bath Estate doing some source reduction and vector control activities ... this evening (Friday [7 Feb 2014]) we will be doing some fogging operations to reduce the population of adults in these communities," he pointed out.

He said the department will also be removing discarded white goods [stoves, fridges, washing machines and other household appliances] in the Bath Estate area since they provide breeding areas for mosquitos. St Ville is calling on residents to play their part by covering water sources, emptying water containers, among other things, in efforts to control the breeding of mosquitos.

Chikungunya is a viral disease, carried mainly by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, that causes a dengue-like sickness. Symptoms include a sudden high fever, severe pain in the wrists, ankles or knuckles, muscle pain, headache, nausea and rash. Joint pain and stiffness are more common with chikungunya than with dengue. Persons who have these symptoms are advised to report to the nearest health centre or their personal health care provider.

[3] Caribbean update

An ECDC risk assessment of the outbreak published on 12 Dec 2013 concluded that the risk of the disease spreading to other islands in the Caribbean region was high. Since then, autochthonous transmission and imported cases of chikungunya have been reported from several islands in the Caribbean.

The systematic laboratory confirmation of cases from the islands Saint Martin, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy and Guadeloupe was stopped because of the ongoing outbreak situation. As of 7 Feb 2014, the following number of cases have been reported:
- St Martin (France): 601 probable or confirmed cases;
- St Maarten (Netherlands): 60 confirmed cases
- Saint Barthelemy: 83 probable or confirmed cases
- Martinique: 518 probable or confirmed cases
- Guadeloupe: 175 probable or confirmed cases
- British Virgin Islands, Jost Van Dyke islands: 6 confirmed cases
- Dominica: 3 confirmed cases and 1 imported confirmed case probably originating from St Martin [now 13 confirmed cases per above report, so the local transmission continues - Mod.TY]

Islands and countries from where imported cases were reported:
- French Guiana: 4 confirmed imported cases (3 from Martinique and 1 from St Martin, with no evidence of local transmission)
- One imported confirmed case on the island of Anguilla, probably originating from St Martin
- One imported case reported on the island Aruba

This overview indicates that the chikungunya outbreak in the Caribbean is still ongoing and spreading.

The chikungunya transmission was detected during an ongoing dengue outbreak in the Caribbean. Both arboviruses are transmitted by the same _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito species. The naive population, the presence of an effective vector in the region and the movement of people in and between islands are factors that make it likely that the outbreak will continue to spread geographically and increase in numbers. Clinicians and travel medicine clinics should remain vigilant regarding imported dengue and chikungunya cases from the Caribbean.

[As the above reports indicate, chikungunya virus infections continue to spread in the Caribbean area. So far, there are no outbreaks reported on the mainland of the Americas.
