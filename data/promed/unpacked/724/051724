Summary - Week 21-26/2015 (18 May-28 Jun 2015)
--------------------------------------------
This is the 1st monthly summer bulletin after weekly reporting ended in week 20/2015.

All countries reported low intensity of influenza activity over the period covered by this report, with sporadic influenza virus detections across the region.

The percentage of sentinel samples testing positive for influenza was low (2 percent), which is normal for this time of the year.

(Weekly bulletins for the 2015-2016 influenza season will start for week 40/2015.)

Virus Characteristics
-----------------------
This is the 1st monthly summer bulletin after weekly reporting ended in week 20/2015.
All countries reported low intensity of influenza activity over the period covered by this report, with sporadic influenza virus detections across the region being low (2 percent), which is normal for this time of the year.

Weekly bulletins for the 2015-2016 influenza season will start for week 40/2015.)

For weeks 21-26, 2 countries reported characterization data: 21 influenza viruses were attributed to a genetic group, and 11 were attributed to an antigenic category. In addition, one A(H3N2) virus was attributed to a genetic group not listed in the database.

A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses
-------------------
All 3 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses characterized genetically fell in clade 6 (subgroup 6B). Viruses falling in this genetic group, along with the 4 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses attributed to an antigenic category, were similar to the component recommended for the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 northern hemisphere vaccines.

A(H3N2) viruses
-----------------
Of the 14 A(H3N2) viruses attributed to a genetic group, 12 belonged to clade 3C.2a, represented by A/Hong Kong/5738/2014; one to clade 3C.3, represented by A/Samara/73/2013; and for one virus, the subgroup was not listed in the reporting categories. One A(H3N2) virus was characterized antigenically as A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like and thus dissimilar to the 2014-2015 season vaccine virus, A/Texas/50/2012. These observations indicate that the A(H3N2) component of the 2014-15 influenza vaccines will probably have had limited effectiveness, as reported for North America.

Influenza B viruses
----------------
Five B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were characterized genetically for weeks 21-26/2015, all fell in clade 3, represented by B/Phuket/3073/2013. Of the influenza B viruses characterized antigenically, all were attributed to antigenic groups of the Yamagata lineage.

Further details on characterization of viruses with collection dates after 31 Aug 2014 are available from the ECDC May 2015 virus characterization report.

The vaccine recommendation for the northern hemisphere 2015-2016 season is available from the WHO headquarters website.

Antiviral susceptibility testing
--------------------
No data were reported on antiviral susceptibility testing.
