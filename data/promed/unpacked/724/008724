Lyme disease cases are on the rise in Ohio, and this year [2015?], Franklin County residents bore the brunt of the bites. The number of people with the disease, spread by ticks, has steadily increased in the past 6 years, according to data from the Ohio Department of Health. From January through September 2015, 146 cases of Lyme disease were reported to the state agency [this number of cases is likely the Ohio State total, but are these confirmed or probable cases?]. In all of 2014, 119 cases were reported [according to the CDC, 94 were confirmed and 25 were probable cases (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html). 10 years ago, 58 cases were reported [the 58 were all confirmed cases (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html).

Cases are reported by county, based on where the infected person lives. Franklin County had 17 cases of Lyme disease [are these confirmed or probable cases?] in the 1st 3 quarters of 2015, more than any other county.

Glen Needham, a professor emeritus of entomology at Ohio State University, said the number of cases has escalated for a few likely reasons. It's possible that people are better educated about ticks and Lyme disease. He said that could mean more people are coming forward when they start showing signs of infection. At the same time, however, Ohio's tick population also is rising, Needham said. "We actually have ticks in places that we never had them before," he said.

Worse, more ticks seem to be carrying the disease. The Medical Entomology Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base studies ticks in Ohio and has found that about 29 percent of ticks collected in Ashtabula and Coshocton counties in 2014 and part of 2015 carried Lyme disease. Similar studies conducted in 2009 and 2010 showed about 10 percent of ticks in the same areas carried the disease.

Ohio used to be home mostly to American dog ticks, which are slightly larger than other ticks found in Ohio and don't carry Lyme disease. American dog ticks carry Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other toxins that can cause temporary paralysis in both humans and dogs.

Black-legged ticks [_Ixodes scapularis_], commonly called deer ticks, are the only carrier of Lyme disease in the Midwest, according to Ohio State University. And over the past few decades, the number of black-legged ticks has grown -- and especially in the past 5 years.

The Ohio Department of Health's numbers show those ticks now live in 67 of Ohio's 88 counties, mostly in forests. They're much smaller than American dog ticks, which make them more difficult to spot.

To avoid ticks, Needham said, tuck your pants into socks and shirts into pants before heading into the woods. Treat clothing with permethrin, a synthetic chemical that deters ticks. And put all your clothing into water or a washing machine when you get home. He said you should check yourself and hiking or hunting partners for ticks after you leave the forest. Pets should be kept on tick-prevention medication year-round.

The size of the ticks, he said, makes them difficult to find. "I think in Ohio we're calibrated to look for dog tick-size ticks and these black-legged ticks are much, much smaller," Needham said. "You could easily pass over a tick thinking it's a mole or just a piece of debris."

[The number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in Ohio was 58 in 2005 and was below that level until it rose to 74 in 2013 and then rose again to 94 in 2014 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/tables.html). The increased incidence of Lyme disease in Ohio could be due to a true increase in the number of cases as the primary tick vector (_Ixodes scapularis_) and the reservoir hosts of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ spread into previously uninvolved regions of the state and growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding wooded areas, but also could be due in part to better recognition and reporting in some counties.

Franklin County surrounds the city of Columbus, the capital of the state of Ohio. A map of Ohio showing the location of its counties can be found at http://geology.com/county-map/ohio.shtml. - Mod.ML
