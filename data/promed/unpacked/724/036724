Bangladesh has put livestock and health officials on high alert after
an outbreak of anthrax spread to more districts, infecting 327 people
since mid-August 2010, officials said Sunday [5 Sep 2010].

The livestock minister suspended all leaves and sent teams to the
affected districts, department deputy director Mosaddek Hossain said.
The move comes after health officials confirmed that anthrax has
infected people in 2 more districts in the country's north and east,
taking the tally to 5 districts. Outbreaks in 2 more districts await
confirmation. "This is the biggest outbreak of anthrax in the
country's history. We are very concerned. The government has set up
surveillance teams in all the affected areas so that the disease
cannot spread to other places," Hossain said.

Scores of cows have died in the outbreak, causing panic among
farmers. The situation has been aggravated by eating and handling of
diseased cows by farmers, he said.

Mahmudur Rahman, a director of health ministry, said 327 people have
been infected with the disease since 18 Aug 2010. All the cases are
cutaneous, or skin, anthrax which causes wound-like lesions. "We are
battling hard to contain the disease. Still, we are receiving reports
of new infections in almost every day," he said.

Alarmed over anthrax spreading into new districts, the government has
declared a red alert across Bangladesh.

Fisheries and livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas told bdnews24.com
about the government decision on Sunday [5 Sep 2010] afternoon. He
said the livestock directorate, civil surgeons and relevant offices
have been asked to remain on high alert. The government has sent 500
000 vials of vaccine for infected cattle. He said that committees
have been formed at the districts headed by the livestock officer and
civil surgeon to coordinate all efforts of anthrax prevention and cure.

The disease was 1st identified in Sirajganj on 19 Aug 2010, when at
least 26 people including 2 children showed signs of infection at
Chithhulia village under Kayempur of Shahjadpur Upazila. A team of
the civil surgeon's office led by Dr Shariful Islam and district
sanitary inspector Ramchandra Saha visited the village and confirmed
the infection. Ramchandra said on 29 Jul 2010 a buffalo of Abdus
Salam and a cow of Shah Alam -- both of which had contracted anthrax
-- were slaughtered and their meat sold off to villagers.

The disease had reportedly spread to Pabna, Tangail and Kushtia, and
more areas across the country. Since then, over 200 people have
contracted anthrax [The current total is 327. - Mod.MHJ].

Biswas and state minister for health Mujibur Rahman Fakir had told
bdnews24.com on 25 Aug 2010 that anthrax was under control.

The government on 29 Aug 2010 declared that check posts were set up
at all entrances and exits of Dhaka to block the infected cattle.

The anthrax outbreak is spreading alarmingly across the country, as
the government offices have confirmed that 254 people have so far
been infected with the anthrax bacterium. Of the 254 infected, 21
patients are from Daulatpur upazila of Kushtia; 14 from Ghatail
upazila of Tangail; one from Bera, 27 from Sathia, and 17 from the
Faridpur upazilas of Pabna; and 53 from Shahzadpur, 52 from Belkuchi,
and 69 from Kamarkhand upazilas of Sirajganj.

Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR), under Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, responsible for
monitoring the disease, revealed the latest data. According to the
officials, the number is increasing rapidly since its 1st reported
case on 19 Aug 2010 at Shahjadpur and adjoining upazilas of Sirajganj.

The latest cutaneous anthrax outbreak is clearly posing to be the
most lethal one among the 7 outbreaks during the last 12 months. A
total of 99 people along with several animals were affected during
the earlier outbreaks.

The government agencies are claiming that there is nothing to be
afraid of, as treatment facilities are available and immediate
treatment can cure patients easily. However, the epidemic is rapidly
spreading due to inadequate supply of vaccination and lack of
awareness among the public.

Sirajganj district livestock office recently reported that the
outbreak started after the local villagers had eaten tainted beef and
processed or had come into contact with meat, bone, hair and hides of
anthrax-infected cows since 29 Jul 2010. According to the office, 21
cows in the area have already died of anthrax, while 7 were
slaughtered, whose meat was later sold to the local people.

"This is the 8th anthrax outbreak of the year [2010], and there is
absolutely nothing to be worried about, as the chances of mortality
are extremely low after contracting the disease," said IEDCR chief
Mahmudur Rahman.

There is a general fear that the outbreak may spread across the
country within the next 2 months prior to Eid-ul-Azha, the Muslim
festival, when a large number of sacrificial animals are bought and sold.

At least 15 more people are feared to be infected with anthrax in
Meherpur and Chuadanga districts, health officials said on Saturday
[4 Sep 2010]. Of them, 14 were identified in Gangni upazila of
Meherpur while another was in Alamdanga upazila of Chuadanga, our
Kushtia correspondent reports.

The disease was identified in Kushtia on 1 Sep 2010 after [being
found in] the districts of Sirajganj, Pabna and Tangail in the last
month [August 2010]. The disease was identified in Sirajganj on 20
Aug 2010, and it spread out into its neighbouring district Pabna on
22 Aug 2010, while in Tangail on 31 Aug 2010.

Gangni upazila health officer Dr Zohurul Islam said 14 people were
suspected to have contracted anthrax at Debipur, Karamdi and Jhorpota
villages. Some of them are undergoing treatment at the upazila health
complex, Zohurul added. According to villagers, a sick cow of Debipur
village was slaughtered a few days ago. Some people of the village
consumed the meat causing the disease, they added. Meherpur civil
surgeon Dr Abdus Sahid said they are still waiting for experts'
opinion on the blood and skin samples sent to Dhaka.

Alamdanga upazila health officer Dr Liakat Ali said it is suspected
that anthrax broke out in Charjadabpur village, as a sick goat of the
village was slaughtered nearly a week before. Later, family members
consumed the meat and the owner has been suffering pain for 2 days
and fell sick on Saturday [4 Sep 2010], he added. He was admitted to
Alamdanga Upazila Health Complex.

[The varying numbers of human cases indicates a level of
uncoordinated news briefings, but it is a rapidly moving situation
over extended areas. The 4th report [4] above with the very brief
account of the owner's clinical travails is more typical of
gastro-enteric anthrax than cutaneous anthrax. In spite of
ministerial statements to the contrary, it would seem that this
disease is still uncontrolled in both humans and livestock. Once the
latter's vaccination is effective, then the human incidence should
fall off, maybe sooner if people can be persuaded to not slaughter
and butcher sick stock. This national emergency will provide the
necessary political support for an effective national control and
surveillance programme.

This situation indicates that the veterinary authorities in West
Bengal should be on high alert:
