_Cyclospora cayetanensis_: first imported infections in Germany
Here we report the cases of two female patients, aged 70 and 58 years old,
respectively, who suffered from severe, prolonged diarrhea after a vacation
in Singapore, Java and Bali. Routine microbiological laboratory diagnostics
were unable to demonstrate the presence of known enteropathogenic bacteria.
Modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining of fecal smears revealed oocysts of
_Cyclospora cayetanensis_, and treatment of the patients with co-trimoxazole
was promptly effective.
