A contagious illness that has killed 15 local racing greyhounds has forced
a quarantine of dogs at The Naples-Fort Myers Greyhound Track.
All greyhound tracks in Florida except the St. Petersburg Kennel Club have
instituted quarantines, according to Kristen Alexis Ploska, spokeswoman for
the Florida Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering.
Two other dogs died at the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Ploska said.
"The University of Florida, College of Veterinary Medicine's primary
diagnosis is viral canine influenza, which leads to a secondary bacterial
infection resulting in hemorrhagic pneumonia," Ploska said.
University researchers are considering whether the ailment is related to an
equine influenza that moved from horses to greyhounds and killed 8 dogs in
Jacksonville in January 2006. They also are studying whether it could be
the same respiratory illness that killed at least 10 dogs statewide in July
2004.
Starting Thursday, the number of races at the Bonita Springs track has been
reduced to 8 to 11 daily, down by 3 to 5 races a day, general manager Larry
Baldwin said. Saturday afternoon races have been canceled, but the track
will be open for simulcast wagering. Evening races will be held.
"After assessing the situation and consulting with our veterinarian, Dr.
Hakim Hamici, this will give the greyhounds the proper rest between races,"
Baldwin said. As many as 400 dogs are housed at the track.
Under the voluntary quarantine, which began Wednesday, dogs may not come
and go from the track.
"Everything is under control, and the kennels are improving on a daily
basis," Hamici said. "This flu strain has been present for about 10 days,
and the greyhounds continue to get better each day."
The university and the state are cooperating to study viruses in greyhounds
statewide.
"We are aware of the situation down there," said Sarah Carey, spokeswoman
for the College of Veterinary Medicine. "We are on top of it." Carey said
veterinarian Cynda Crawford has been collecting samples during the last
week or two. She declined to say if or when Crawford was in Bonita Springs.
Larry Mosher, the local track's director of racing, expects the ailment to
be diminished or eliminated within 2 weeks. "Our Number 1 concern is the
safety of the greyhounds, and by reducing the daily racing schedule we
allow the dogs to remain healthy," he said.

[A large group of animals brought from multiple sites to a stressful
atmosphere are likely to acquire and spread some disease or illness.
Racing is stressful to these animals, even under the very best of
conditions. It is also to be remembered that this disease is fatal only to
a small number of these athletes. - Mod.TG]
