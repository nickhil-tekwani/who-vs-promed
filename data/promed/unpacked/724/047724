Farmers work to prevent strawberry virus spread
------------------------------------------------
Growers have begun work to prevent further spread of a virus [disease] that has infected the fields of 2 Prince Edward Island (PEI) strawberry farms. The disease is the same as the one threatening Nova Scotia's strawberry industry. 'I've never seen anything of this magnitude,' [said a PEI] strawberry grower.

The plant illness is spread by the strawberry aphid. It weakens plants to the point where the berries themselves are undesirably small, or the plant fails to produce berries altogether.

The Department of Agriculture will sample as many fields as they can to find out the extent of the virus. It's still not clear exactly how many fields are infected. The province hopes to have more answers later this month [June 2013]. "There is no cure, the only option is eradication of the plant and/or the stand it's in." That means plowing under crops or pulling out infected plants [which] could be an expensive solution.

"It's not only your immediate crop for this year, but how do you manage it down the road in the next 2 to 3 years?" said the strawberry farmer. [Another] farmer affected by the pest said he expects to begin spraying his fields soon to kill the aphids and prevent the spread of the virus.

[This outbreak of a virus disease in strawberry crops has been reported from Canada as well as the US (see links below). The problem is thought to have originated in Nova Scotia and to have spread from there with infected strawberry seedlings. It has been shown to be associated with _Strawberry mild yellow edge virus_ and _Strawberry mottle virus_. Although some of the recent news stories have claimed recombination of the 2 viruses into a 'new mutant' virus, no scientific evidence for this has been presented. Rather, the problem appears to be due to a synergistic coinfection enhancing symptom severity over single-virus infections.

_Strawberry mottle virus_ (SMoV; family _Secoviridae_, not yet assigned to a genus) is the most widespread virus affecting strawberry plants worldwide. Symptoms may include vein clearing, leaf mottle, reduced plant vigour, and reduced fruit production. Symptoms vary seasonally, and some _Fragaria_ species do not show the typical mottling at all. The virus is spread by aphids including several _Chaetosiphon_ species and _Aphis gossypii_, and can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but is not seed transmitted. There are many strains of SMoV with varying severity. SMoV may also be found in a virus complex together with several other species, including SMYEV (_Strawberry mild yellow edge virus_), which can severely reduce yield. For example, a coinfection of SMoV and SMYEV has been reported from Canada before (see link below).

Strawberry mild yellow edge (SMYE) is one of the widespread and common virus diseases in cultivated strawberries and is transmitted by aphid vectors. Symptoms may include leaf yellowing, stunting of plants, loss of plant vigour and yield reduction. It is caused by _Strawberry mild yellow edge virus_ (SMYEV; genus _Potexvirus_) which may be found together with a luteovirus originally designated strawberry mild yellow edge virus (with the potexvirus as SMYE-associated virus), but now recognised as a strain or synonym of _Soybean dwarf virus_ (SbDV; genus _Luteovirus_). The coinfection of the potexvirus and luteovirus has been described from Canada and Germany; the situation elsewhere remains unclear.

Disease management of these viruses may include crop rotation with non-hosts and vector control, but use of certified clean planting material is essential. Crop cultivars vary in susceptibility and many cultivars can be symptomless carriers.
