In response to the moderator's questions on fire blight in Australia:
-----------------------------------------------
The disease [was observed in the Melbourne Royal Botanic Gardens in May
1997. An account has been published (Australasian Plant Pathology Vol
29:120-128, (2000) but doubt remains as to the real identity of the
[pathogen. New Zealand and German labs reportedly isolated _Erwinia
amylovora_ but the Australian labs, using similar test protocols,
could not isolate this [bacterium. The quoted paper emphasised that
"although symptoms resembling fire blight were observed ...., the
possibility that the dieback symptoms were induced by other pathogens must
also be considered." Extensive surveys [in Australia have not detected the
disease or [_E. amylovora_.

[For information, officials of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service
on 19 Jun 1997, confirmed that fire blight disease was observed on
cotoneaster (an ornamental shrub) collected at 2 locations (Royal Botanic
Gardens, Melbourne, and Adelaide Gardens) and that _E. amylovora_ had been
isolated in both instances. Pathogenicity tests using the pathogen induced
characteristic symptoms in pear seedlings. At that time, surveys throughout
Australia failed to detect fire blight in commercial orchards, nurseries and
urban areas, and none have reported since. Dr. Cother is quite correct in
concluding that the identity of the pathogen remains undetermined, although
I would have thought that the problem of identification would have been
solved by now. Are any of our subscribers working on this case? For
