Not only dengue, but another mosquito-borne disease [virus]
chikungunya, is now a cause of worry for Delhiites. Chikungunya [virus
infection] cases have risen to 71 after 8 people tested positive in
the past 24 hours, MCD's [Municipal Corporation of Delhi] public
health committee Chairman V K Monga said. "It is a cause of worry as
chikungunya cases are multiplying even after winter has arrived," he
said.

[The number of chikungunya cases has increased from 54 on 3 Nov 2011
(see ProMED-mail archive number 20111105.3294) to 71 just 8 days later
on 11 Nov 2011. No mention is made of attempts at mosquito vector
control or public education in the above brief report above. As
weather becomes cooler, transmission of the virus should slow. There
have been cases of chikungunya virus infection in various locations in
India this year (2011).
