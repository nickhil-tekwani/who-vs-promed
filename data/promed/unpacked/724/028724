More than 80 children have been infected with salmonellosis in the
western city of Liepaja, Latvia in the past 12 days, national health
officials said on Friday [28 Nov 2008].

All of the children, aged between 2 and 10, were at kindergartens and
schools serviced by the food company Maras Lacis. The company has
been temporally shut down, a spokesman for the national food and
veterinary service said. Of the infected children, 13 have been
hospitalized.

[The source of the outbreak and the serotype of the organism are not
stated in the posting. If the cases occurred over 12 days, the
outbreak is likely related to a food that was not served only once,
unless secondary cases also occurred.
