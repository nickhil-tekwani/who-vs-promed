On 5 Mar 1999, the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental
Health (SCIEH) was informed of five cases of rubella having occurred in
the Grampian Region Health Board. Three females and two males, each in
the early to mid twenties having been reported ill. Two of the females
are students from Greece. Three of the five were IgM confirmed cases.
Greek colleagues from the National Surveillance Centre in Athens were
contacted and confirmed to SCIEH a major Rubella outbreak in
Greece which started in late December 1998. To date, 500 cases have
been reported, country-wide, in Greece, most of them being young adults.
Cases first appeared among male military recruits, 300 being affected.
Further spread of the vius in the general population accounts for 200
additional cases. To date, no cases of congenital rubella syndrome
associated with the outbreak have been identified.
In Greece, the
national immunization programme incorporates 2 x doses of MMR vaccine at
ages of 15 months and 10 years. In the United Kingdon, 2 x doses are
given at 15-18 months and again at pre-entry to primary school.
