Following the realization of the chronic outbreak afflicting a pack of
foxhounds in Millbrook NY, 130 km north of New York City, in 1999 when some
two dozen hounds died, researchers at NCSU [North Carolina State
University, CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
Walter Reed Army Institute of Research initiated a testing of the 11 000
foxhounds kept by US hunts.
About 12% had antibodies to _Leishmania_ though the majority are
asymptomatic. These seropositive dogs were in the eastern USA. Some 50 dogs
from in and around Millbrook have also been tested and found to be
seronegative, as were the 450 stored canine serum samples at CDC.
How the Millbrook hounds became infected remains unknown as it is well
north of any known sand fly sites in New Jersey. However, it is noted that
foxhounds are frequent fliers and may have been infected while in the
southern states. The researchers are reported as commenting, "We probably
uncovered a smouldering epidemic that has been in this country for 20 years
or more."

[I have heard from Ed Breitschwerdt (<Ed_Breitschwerdt@ncsu.edu>) that the
full manuscript describing this study has yet to be submitted to a
scientific journal. Anyone needing details should contact him. As yet the
details of the actual geographic distribution of the 11 000 hounds tested
and counties with positive and negative hunts have not been revealed. -
