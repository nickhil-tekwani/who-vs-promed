Syphilis rates among men who have sex with men have risen dramatically in Victoria [Australia] over the past year, with a significant increase specifically in HIV-positive men.

The number of syphilis cases notified in 2013 was up 42 per cent on 2012 and 126 per cent on 2010, with a total of 663 reported cases. Around half of the reported cases were in HIV-positive men, and a significant proportion of those cases were re-infections.

Professor Kit Fairley from Alfred Health told the Star Observer despite the overall increase in syphilis rates the proportion of infections among HIV-positive men reflected the norm.

A rise in syphilis rates is a particular public health concern due to its relationship to HIV transmission. A person with syphilis is more likely to both contract and transmit HIV, but Fairley said researchers were unclear of the exact reasons for this. "We're not sure whether that relates to some differences in sexual practices or whether that relates to differences in immunity or susceptibility," Fairley said.

Syphilis has been on the rise across Australia, but Victoria saw the largest increase last year [2013]. It has prompted Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr Rosemary Lester to issue a health alert, encouraging all men who have sex with men (MSM) to get tested for the infection at least once a year. The alert also stated MSM with more than 10 partners in the past year should test for syphilis every 3 months, and HIV-positive MSM should be screened for syphilis as part of routine HIV monitoring.

Fairley told the Star Observer a focus on encouraging both clinicians and at-risk groups to test more often for syphilis was the best approach to curbing rising rates, given the difficulty of protecting against infection during sex.

"The thing about syphilis -- the same thing is true for gonorrhoea -- is it can be transmitted through non-anal sex. So oral sex or mutual masturbation or other stuff can transmit syphilis equally well. So if HIV-positive individuals are being safer, it doesn't actually help with syphilis," Fairley explained.

Syphilis is a notifiable disease in Australia, meaning cases must be reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System.

[Victoria, in southeastern Australia, is the country's most densely populated state and its 2nd-most populous state overall. Most of its population of over 5.7 million is concentrated in the area surrounding Port Phillip Bay, which includes the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Melbourne, which is Australia's 2nd-largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)).

The following has been extracted from Annual reports -- Australia's notifiable disease status, 2010: Annual report of the national notifiable diseases surveillance system [NNDSS]. NNDSS Annual Report Writing Group. Communicable Diseases Intelligence; 36(1). Quarterly report March 2012; available at http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/cda-cdi3601-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3601.pdf.

The rate of early syphilis (less than 2 years duration) notifications increased from 3.2 per 100 000 in 2005 to a peak of 6.7 per 100 000 in 2007 and has been gradually declining since then to 4.9 per 100 000 in 2010. Over the period 2005 to 2007, notification rates amongst males increased substantially, in the 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49 year age groups but since then have either decreased or remained relatively stable. While national rates have declined since 2007 overall, the increase in men between 2005 and 2010 has, as in other developed countries, predominantly affected men who have sex with men (MSM).

In 2010, nationally the rates of early syphilis for males and females were 8.9 and 1.0 per 100 000 population respectively, representing a male to female ratio of 9:1. In Victoria in 2010, the overall rate was 5.2 (291 cases) with a rate in males of 9.6 (264 cases) versus 0.9 (26 cases) in females.

Reported increases in incidence of infectious syphilis among MSM have been characterized by high rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, high-risk sexual behavior, use of drugs such as methamphetamines, use of Internet chat rooms to meet sex partners (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), and more recently use of smartphone applications like Grindr, a gay social networking site (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grindr). Grindr allows users to meet other men within close proximity using the mobile device's global positioning system (GPS) location-based services to show men nearby who are also on Grindr. The increases in syphilis have been attributed in part to "HIV prevention fatigue" -- that is, diminished motivation to practice safer sex. - Mod.ML
