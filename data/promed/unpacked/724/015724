Four of the Duke Lemur Center's endangered aye-ayes have died from unknown causes, the University announced [Wed 26 Oct 2016].

A total of 2 females and 2 males -- ranging in age from 7 to 28 [years] -- succumbed to a mysterious ailment in rapid succession. The lemurs were named Morticia, Norman Bates, Merlin, and Angelique.

"We have experienced a tragedy," the Lemur Center's Director Anne Yoder said in the release. "The staff is devastated."

Tuesday afternoon [25 Oct 2016], 2 lemurs were transported to the center's emergency care unit after a staff member observed their lethargic behavior. The 1st one died within 20 minutes.

Video cameras from the lemurs' enclosure show that the animals' behavior appeared normal until 2 pm [Tue 25 Oct 2016].

"This is the most significant loss we've ever had and is a terrible blow to our breeding program," said Andrea Katz, the center's animal curator, in the release. "This is a significant percentage of the aye-ayes in the US at this time."

There are now 9 aye-ayes left alive at the center -- of the fewer than 50 held in captivity around the world.

Lemur Center veterinarian Bobby Schopler said it is unlikely that an infectious agent caused the lemurs' deaths but noted that the center is investigating the situation.

The staff of the Lemur Center is closely monitoring the remaining lemurs, which currently do not show any signs of illness.

[The aye-aye (_Daubentonia madagascariensis_) is an endangered primate native to Madagascar. Its breeding in captivity is very difficult. Since 1987 the aye-aye has been kept at Duke University Primate Center. The 1st birth there occurred in 1992.
