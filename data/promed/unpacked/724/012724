Officials at Yosemite National Park said [Fri 14 Aug 2015] they will temporarily close a popular campsite after 2 squirrels died of plague in the area.

Tuolumne Meadows Campground will close from noon Monday through noon Friday [17-21 Aug 2015] so authorities can treat the area with a flea-killing insecticide.

Campers had their reservations canceled at the 304-site campground so the insecticide can be sprayed into rodent "burrow holes," the California Department of Health said.

Plague is carried by rodents and is spread by fleas, but transmission between people is rare.

"Although this is a rare disease, and the current risk to humans is low, eliminating the fleas is the best way to protect the public from the disease," said Dr Karen Smith, director of the state Health Department. "By eliminating the fleas, we reduce the risk of human exposure and break the cycle of plague in rodents at the sites."

Since 1970, 42 people in California have contracted plague, resulting in 9 deaths. Health officials find plague-infected animals every year, mostly in the state's mountains and foothill regions.

Last year [2014], plague was found in the counties of El Dorado, Mariposa, Modoc, Plumas, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Sierra.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection. - Mod.PMB
