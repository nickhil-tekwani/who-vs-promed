AOTOU (China) -- After 2 decades of breathless economic development -- and
the pollution and ecological shifts going with it -- severe red tides have
begun to plague China's vast coastline, surfacing unexpectedly like thieves
and stealing the earnings of millions of people who depend on the ocean's
bounty to survive.
Aotou, perched on the edge of a bay opening on to the South China Sea, has
been the victim of at least 2 major red tides this season. Thousands of
dead fish floated in the bay off Aotou. The fishermen have had their
livelihoods threatened increasingly by one of China's biggest environmental
problems, a little-publicized blight experts say costs the country more
than US$100 million (S$173 million) every year. Two years ago, a massive
algae bloom near Hong Kong killed up to 75 percent of the entire stock of
Hong Kong's fish farms, wiping out local fishermen and triggering a
political outcry in the former British territory.
In Aotou, red-tide outbreaks interrupt the simple routine of daily life in
this picturesque corner of southern Guangdong province. Once the algae
reach full bloom, residents have little choice but to wait out the event,
which can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks. All of that adds
up to lost income for fishermen.
The algae multiply so quickly that at the peak of an invasion in August, a
quart of seawater was found to contain about 10 million algae cells.
The areas hit hardest by the red-tide phenomenon have been Bohai Sea in the
north-east, the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Large-scale red
tides also encroach regularly on China's Zhoushan Islands in the East China
Sea, not far from Shanghai. And in the south, toxic blooms strike around
Guangdong and Fujian provinces.
