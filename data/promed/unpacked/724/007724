Increasing export demand for eggplant has prompted the Agriculture
Ministry to call on local farmers to increase production. The
ministry quoted the managing director of Natures Way Co-operative,
Sant Kumar, as saying the current supply of eggplant was better than
in the past few months. Nadi-based Natures Way helps local vegetable
producers package and export their produce. Mr Kumar called on local
farmers to supply quality export varieties of eggplant.

Mr Kumar said the rainy weather at the beginning of the year [2007]
affected exports. Mr Kumar said rainy weather brought in diseases
such as the blossom blight, which had to be treated with fungicide
spraying and field sanitation. He said another common disease,
thrips, needed to be treated with chemicals. He said the risk of
these diseases diminished as the weather improved.

Mr Kumar emphasised that farmers needed to increase their production
during the wet season so that consistency of supply was maintained
throughout the year. He said eggplants should be treated under the
High Temperature Forced Air facility before being exported to New Zealand.

[Blossom blights are caused by fungal pathogens that affects the
flowers (occasionally leaves and stems) of many plants. Infected
flowers fail to set seed, resulting in yield loss. Spores are spread
by wind and/or water droplets (rain) from nearby sources (infected
crops, crop residues from past infected plants). The causal agents
seem to vary from crop to crop and in different areas.

_Botrytis_ is a filamentous fungus isolated from decaying plants.
Despite its cosmopolitan feature, it is more commonly reported from
tropical and temperate areas. Species in the genus affect many
vegetable crops causing a range of blights and rots. They can also
cause blossom blights which often precede and lead to fruit and stem
rots. Aging flower petals of beans, carrot, celery, eggplant, onion,
pepper, squash, and tomato are particularly susceptible to
colonisation by _Botrytis_ species, and under cool, humid conditions,
abundant mycelium and conidia (spores) are produced on colonised
petals. The fungi often grow from the fading flower petals into the
rest of the inflorescence, or into developing fruit where it causes a
blossom-end rot. From there, it can spread and destroy part or all of
the fruit. It is possible that _Botrytis_ species may be responsible
for the blossom blight reported here.

Thrips (insects in the order _Thysanoptera_) are pests of many crops
and also vectors of some plant viruses. The species that attack
eggplant are mostly active during the dry season, causing browning of
leaves, especially on the lower leaf surface, and scarring of fruit.
