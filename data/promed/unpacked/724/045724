6 Races of _Venturia inaequalis_ are Found Causing Apple Scab in Spain
-----------------------------------------------
A. Martinez-Bilbao and J. Murillo, Departamento Produccion Agraria,
Universidad Publica de Navarra, 31006 Pamplona, Spain. Plant Dis. 89:908,
2005; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-89-0908A. Accepted for
publication 27 Apr 2005.
Apple scab, caused by the ascomycete _Venturia inaequalis_, is an important
disease of apple (_Malus domestica_) worldwide and is generally managed
with intensive applications of fungicides or, for specific markets, by the
planting of resistant cultivars. Currently, 8 races of the pathogen have
been defined on the basis of their ability to overcome sources of
resistance used by plant breeders (2). We undertook the identification of
apple scab races present in Spain as a necessary step for the deployment of
resistant cultivars.
Spore suspensions (250 000 spores per ml) were prepared from fresh lesions
of apple scab collected from apple trees in commercial or domestic orchards
located in the northeastern Spanish provinces of Gerona, Guipuzcoa, and
Navarra. To identify races 1 to 7, the suspensions were used to inoculate
cv. Gala and 6 differential apple clones with 5 replicates. Cultivar Gala
was used as a universal susceptible control. The differential apple clones
included X2250, X2253 (Geneva), X2249, X2225, X2596 (Prima), and X6518 (_M.
floribunda_ 821) (1,4).
All leaves were assessed on each inoculated shoot 17 days after
inoculation, and the type of symptoms were scored using the scale of
Chevalier et al. (3). Sporulation was evaluated on 7 replicate leaf discs
(one cm in diameter) for each combination of inoculum and plant host (4).
All the inocula tested produced typical apple scab symptoms and sporulation
(one million conidia per square centimeter on cv. Gala).
Races 2, 3, 5, and 6 were identified on the basis of the elicitation of
typical disease symptoms with abundant sporulation (>3 million conidia per
square cm on clones X2250, X2253, X2225, and X2596, respectively). Races 2
and 6 were present in inocula from Gerona, Guipuzcoa, and Navarra, whereas
races 3 and 5 were identified only in an inoculum from Tudela, Navarra. An
inoculum from La Tallada, Gerona, was assigned to race 1, because it
produced typical disease symptoms and sporulation only on cv. Gala, while
the differential clones were scored as resistant.
In Santesteban, Navarra, a monosporic isolate of _V. inaequalis_,
designated VIP28, was obtained in the field from a single lesion in a
2-year-old tree of clone 2.1.1, which is resistant to race 1. VIP28
produced lesions typical of weak virulence in clone X6518 and produced a
significant degree of sporulation (850 000 conidia per square cm), whereas
the differential clones for races 2 to 6 were scored as resistant,
indicating that this isolate can be classified as race 7 (1).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of races of _V. inaequalis_
present in Spain.

[Based on previous evaluation of local cultivars, a program for breeding
cider apple (_Malus domestica_) cultivars was initiated in the SERIDA of
Asturias (NW Spain) in 1989 with 3 major aims: to improve the durable
resistance to diseases and pests of local cultivars, to obtain cultivars
with no biennial bearing and to improve fruit quality. To achieve the 1st
objective, Asturian cultivars with low susceptibility to scab were crossed
with "Florina", which carries the Vf gene for resistance to apple scab
caused by _Venturia inaequalis_ and shows very low susceptibility to fire
blight caused by _Erwinia amylovora_ and resistance to the rosy apple aphid
(_Dysaphis plantaginea_). The 1st cross, performed in 1989, was "Raxao" x
"Florina." After greenhouse and nursery evaluation, 34 hybrids resistant to
scab (the presence of the Vf gene has been confirmed with molecular
markers) and low susceptibility to powdery mildew (_Podosphaera
leucotricha_) were pre-selected. After evaluation of these hybrids against
the rosy apple aphid, fire blight, apple scab and powdery mildew, as well
as characterization of their productivity and quality, 4 hybrids were
selected and are in registry at the present time. Numerous other crossings
have been performed since then and are in different phases of evaluation
and selection.
