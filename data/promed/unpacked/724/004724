[In January 2015, the Gaza Ministry of Agriculture banned poultry imports from the West Bank and Israel (http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=755838) in order to reduce the risk of introducing avian influenza. Other control and prevention measures were not reported. The disease continues to spread in the region. The control and prevention measures for this disease should be reviewed carefully. - Mod.SMA

Since early 2015, the Palestinian Authority (PA) notified to the OIE 4 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry, reportedly starting 20 Jan 2015, the most recent one starting 22 Mar 2015 (see archive no 20150326.3256159). Modified stamping out policy was applied. Starting 18 Jan 2015, Israel reported 8 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks; stamping out policy was applied. The disease was reportedly resolved 11 Feb 2015.

In case confirmed, this is to become the 1st HPAI H5N1 outbreak ever reported from the Gaza strip. The PA is composed of 2 main administrative divisions, the West Bank and the Gaza strip, separated by Israel's territory. All previous HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in the PA were restricted to the West Bank.

Information on the laboratory that diagnosed the outbreak and confirmation of the diagnosis by a reference laboratory are to be anticipated. Genotyping is expected as well. To the best of our knowledge, no information on this event, reportedly observed as early as 20 Mar 2015, has become available regionally. In case confirmed, this means a serious threat to southern Israel.

According to reliable information, the 2015 outbreaks in Israel and the PA (West Bank) have been caused by a HPAI H5N1 virus strain genotyped as closely related to the strain recently circulating in Egypt. Details of the sequencing will, hopefully, become publicly available soon. - Mod.AS
