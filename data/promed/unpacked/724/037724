A Bryan County [Oklahoma] child, who was hospitalized for Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), has died because of the protozoan infection health officials announced today. According to an Ardmoreite.com news report Tuesday, the yet unnamed child contracted the deadly amoeba last week while swimming and diving in the Red River. This is the sixth fatality due to _Naegleria fowleri_ in the Sooner State [nickname for the state of Oklahoma] in the past 13 years.

_N. fowleri_ is a single-celled protozoan parasite (amoeba) that is found in very warm surface waters such as lakes, ponds, and rivers. The warm water temperatures of the hot summer months allow the ameba to multiply.

People typically get infected by swimming, jumping or playing in freshwater and get the water up their nose. From there the parasite travels to the brain and spinal cord and necrotizes, or basically eats brain tissue.

The disease is known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) and it has a very rapid progression. Typical symptoms may start after a day or two: headache, fever, nausea and vomiting. Later symptoms may include seizures, irrational behavior, hallucinations and finally coma and death. The course of the disease typically last about a week. Because the symptoms are very similar to bacterial meningitis, [the possibility of] PAM may not even be considered in the diagnosis. Fortunately, it's a pretty rare disease, with only approximately 32 cases in the past decade. Unfortunately, treatment is usually unsuccessful with only a handful of people surviving infection.

You should always assume there is some risk when swimming in freshwater. The location and number of amoeba present in a body of water varies from time to time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend these four steps to reduce your risk of infection:

- Avoid water-related activities in bodies of warm freshwater, hot springs, and thermally-polluted water such as water around power plants.
- Avoid water-related activities in warm freshwater during periods of high water temperature and low water levels.
- Hold the nose shut or use nose clips when taking part in water-related activities in bodies of warm freshwater such as lakes, rivers, or hot springs.
- Avoid digging in or stirring up the sediment while taking part in water-related activities in shallow, warm freshwater areas.

The Oklahoma State Department of Health announced Tuesday [31 July 2012] that a child has died from a waterborne illness caught while swimming in the Red River last week. Bryan County health officials are not releasing the child's name, age, or gender, but say the youngster died from Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by an infection with a single celled organism that breeds in stagnant water.

The disease-causing amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_, is naturally present in most lakes, ponds, and rivers, but multiply in warmer waters.

Symptoms of PAM include high fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Later, symptoms can include stiff neck, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.

The disease is not contagious. To avoid infections, health officials encourage Oklahomans to only swim in properly maintained pools, but if they do swim in natural bodies of water, to keep water out of the nose and mouth and wear earplugs and goggles.

The same amoeba killed two young boys in Tulsa in 2005.

The Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) reacted strongly to Sindh health department's statements that the infection caused by _Naegleria fowleri_ was spreading because of faulty chlorination in the board's pipeline system.

The Disease Early Warning System confirmed five deaths from the infection in the recent months while reports from different hospitals put the figure at around ten since January 2012.

The health department had earlier conjectured that on the basis of the information collected, the possibility that the organism was in the city's water supply could not be ruled out. It hoped that this would prompt KWSB to check the city's water supply for safe levels of chlorination. A health official from the committee investigating the matter told The Express Tribune that they have yet to receive a reply from KWSB.

Dr Imdadullah Siddiqui, the medical services director at Karachi Metropolitan Corporation [KMC], who is a part of the committee, wrote a letter on July 25 to KWSB's managing director in which he said that that it appeared as if the organism was in the water supply. He did not receive a reply.

Syed Zaheer Abbas, a chief engineer at KWSB, said, "We are not compelled to send them any report," he said, arguing that he did not receive any instructions to do so either. He also claimed that KWSB chlorinates at all filtration plants according to international standards. "The organism lives in pools of stagnant water and tanks at people's houses," he insisted. "We can only check for its presence in our own systems and for that too we are not answerable to anyone."

Speaking to The Express Tribune on Monday, KWSB managing director, Misbahuddin Fareed said that sufficient quantities of chlorine were being mixed in the water at the filtration plants. "KWSB has become a convenient scapegoat for officials who have failed to control the outbreak."

The utility mixes chlorine in water at five filer [?] plants and maintains a ratio of two parts per million, which is a little over the standards set by the World Health Organisation. But it has been reported that the levels of chlorine found in the water tanks at houses are lower than those found at the plants. KMC has already alerted staff at its hospitals about existence of the rare disease, but experts say much more needs to be done to make the public aware about the issue. The danger increases in summers as the organism multiplies in high temperatures, she said. "People should make sure that the water doesn't get too far into the nose. That is from where the organism reaches the brain and damages it."

The rising number of deaths due to waterborne _Naegleria_ meningitis in the city has brought the performance of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board -- the main government agency responsible for the provision of water to the entire population and industries in Karachi -- into focus.

A source in the health department said the WHO's Disease Early Warning System (DEWS) confirmed on Wednesday [25 Jul 2012] yet another death of a person in the city, who was being treated at an armed forces hospital.

Since five of the six people died of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) had no history of swimming in a public pool or a recreational farm settings in days before their deaths, a DEWS team in collaboration with another international agency has been considering measures to contain the outbreak of the disease and to assist the health department and the KWSB in controlling the emergency-like situation due to the disease caused by an amoeba -- _Naegleria fowleri_.

In a report submitted to the provincial health minister on Wednesday, the health officers assigned to look into the waterborne amoeba-caused deaths in various private hospitals since July 6, among other observations, called for proper chlorination of water supplied to the city.

_Naegleria fowleri_ is an organism typically found in warm bodies of freshwater, lakes, ponds and in water reservoirs and swimming pools of recreational places, residential/commercial hotels, farm houses, parks, etc, if they are not chlorinated after refilling of the reservoir within 15 minutes, the report said.

The report said that an inspection committee under the head of EDO-Health Karachi had been constituted to examine all such places on a permanent basis and ensure all swimming pools have chlorinated water.

An expert commented that water used for drinking and cooking should be free of pathogenic (disease causing) micro-organisms.

Purification of drinking water containing pathogenic micro-organisms requires specific treatment called disinfection.

It was said that although there were several methods to eliminate disease-causing micro-organisms from water, chlorination was the most commonly used method. "When combined with filtration, chlorination is an excellent way to disinfect drinking water supplies," the expert said.

According to DEWS, the patient who died at the armed forces hospital was a 49-year-old man admitted to the hospital on July 8, while the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture was found positive for _Naegleria fowleri_ on July 10. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital with a history of high-grade fever, altered consciousness, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness and he died on July 16, a DEWS report said.

In the meantime, the DEWS team also had a meeting with United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund representatives on containment measures regarding _Naegleria_ meningitis.

The participants in the meeting were told that the micro-organisms could only survive in fresh stagnant water (un-chlorinated) and they could be checked by appropriate chlorination of fresh water sources.

During the meeting it was concluded that the main stakeholder in the matter apart from the health department was the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board so both the WHO and the UNICEF teams would try to contact the officials concerned and sensitise them to the matter so that they take necessary steps. It was further noted in the meeting that the public needed to be sensitised to the issue so that they protect themselves from getting this deadly infection, without getting into a panic about the situation.

According to DEWS, so far three patients have died at the Liaquat National Hospital and one each at the Aga Khan University Hospital, the Munawar Memorial Hospital and the PNS Shifa Hospital. Four of the patients who died on July 6, 11, 13 and 14 were between 22 and 27 years of age, while two deceased were between 44 and 49 years of age and only one of them had a history of swimming, the relevant data suggested. A chief engineer of the KWSB, Syed Zaheer Abbas Zaidi, told Dawn on Wednesday that authorities at the board were already alarmed over the situation and personally visiting various installations to know about the filtration and chlorination activities in an effort to build up public confidence in the water consumed round the year.

He said that the board had been conducting the chlorination of over 500 million gallon of water every day at its six filter and water treatment plants, adding that there was no laxity in efforts to check the quality of water and measures were being taken in line with international water purification standards. A KWSB communication said that MPAs Syed Khalid Ali, Nishat Ahmad Zia, and Rehan Zafar visited the COD Filter Plant of the KWSB on Wednesday and witnessed the working of the Central Water Laboratory there.

They were told that chlorine cylinders were available in adequate stock, while process of disinfecting the water was also being carried out on a regular basis. The members of the provincial assembly asked the officials and engineers concerned to have samples of water collected from various areas and tested them on a regular basis, a KWSB press release said.

[Karachi, with an estimated population of 24 million, is the largest city, financial center, and major seaport, as well as capital of Sindh province. The city is located in the south of the country, along the Arabian Sea coastline. For a map of Pakistan that shows the location of Karachi, see https://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&oe=UTF-8&q=karachi+map .

[Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is caused by the free-living ameba _Naegleria fowleri_, commonly found in warm freshwater (for example, lakes, rivers, and hot springs), river and lake sediment, and soil. _N. fowleri_ can be found in swimming pools that are poorly maintained, minimally chlorinated, and/or un-chlorinated. Because _N. fowleri_ is thermophilic and can tolerate temperatures of up to 45 degrees C, they proliferate during summer months when the ambient temperature is high. _N. fowleri_ is not found in salt water, like the ocean. Of about 30 species of Naegleria, only one species, N. fowleri_ infects people.

PAM occurs when water containing the organisms is forcefully inhaled through the nose _ usually from diving, jumping or underwater swimming, thereby gaining entry through the cribiform plate at the roof of the nasal cavity to invade the brain. _Naegleria_ infections may also occur when contaminated water from other sources (such as inadequately chlorinated heated swimming pool water or heated tap water) enters the nose, for example when people submerge their heads or cleanse during religious practices, and, possibly, when people irrigate their sinuses (nose) using contaminated tap water. Infection with _N. fowleri_ does not occur by drinking contaminated water.

Initial symptoms of PAM start about 5 days (range 1 to 7 days) after infection. In its early stages, symptoms of PAM may be similar to those of bacterial meningitis. The infection destroys brain tissue causing brain swelling and death. _Naegleria_ are highly sensitive to the antifungal drug amphotericin B, which was used successfully in a 9-year-old girl who was diagnosed early in the disease course and was treated with intravenous and intrathecal amphotericin B, intravenous and intrathecal miconazole, and oral rifampin. The patient survived with minimal neurologic sequelae (Visvesvara GS. Amebic meningoencephalitides and keratitis: challenges in diagnosis and treatment. Curr Opin Infect Dis. Dec 2010;23(6):590-4).

In the United States, the majority of infections occur in southern-tier states during the summer. In the 10 years from 2002 to 2011, 32 infections were reported in the U.S. Of those cases, 28 people were infected by contaminated recreational water, two people were infected by water from a contaminated, geothermal (naturally hot), untreated drinking water supply, and two people were infected after performing nasal irrigation using contaminated tap water (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html ). Only 1 person out of 123 known infected individuals in the United States from 1962 to 2011 has survived (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html ).

The CDC cautions that water-related activities should be avoided in warm freshwater during periods of high water temperature and low water levels;
that the nose should be held shut or nose clips should be used when taking part in water-related activities in bodies of warm freshwater; and digging in, or stirring up, the sediment while taking part in water-related activities in shallow, warm freshwater areas should be avoided (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html ). The CDC also has recommendations for sterilizing contaminated tap water used when people submerge their heads for religious or other purposes or for nasal irrigation, for example, by boiling for 1 minute when at sea level and left to cool (http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html ). - Mod.ML]
