Swan proves bird flu positive in Croatia
-----------------------------------------------------
A swan that flew into Croatia from neighboring Hungary carried the
deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, the agriculture ministry said
Wednesday [2 Nov 2005]. The swan, shot down last week in the area
where 8 swans had already tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain,
was ringed in Hungary, but ornithologists there insisted the bird was
healthy when marked. Hungary has reported no bird flu cases.

Croatian experts informed Hungarian authorities about their test
findings, ministry spokesman Mladen Pavic said.

Hungary's Agriculture Ministry said it was not planning to increase
the number of tests on birds nor introduce new preventive measures
beyond those already in place.

Tests on about 1000 wild and domestic birds have been negative for
bird flu and the country plans to tests about 10 000 more by the end
of the year, it said.

Last week, 6 swans found dead in a nature park of Zdenci in eastern
Croatia on 21 Oct 2005 tested positive for H5N1, as well as 2 others,
found dead later in an adjacent pond, the AP reminds.

Croatian authorities believe all the swans belonged to the same
flock, which came from Hungary.

The region has already been disinfected and all domestic poultry there culled.

The strain -- closely watched by experts for fear it could mutate
into a form easily transmitted to people and therefore causing
pandemic -- has also appeared in Romania, Turkey and Russia.

Bird flu has decimated poultry in Asia and has killed at least 62
people there since 2003, most of whom regularly handled poultry.

Croatian veterinary experts have so far tested about 1500 birds found
dead across the country, and none had been sick with the bird flu,
the ministry said.

[If the news about the swan (shot down in Croatia) is officially
notified, with confirmation that it was a non-symptomatic bird, this
might become a significant development in the studies of H5N1
epidemiology. Such an observation should preferably include the
results of gross and histopathological examinations. Clinically sound
(carriers are the potential spreaders of the virus to short and,
probably, long distances.

The following data is derived from Table 1, "Reported cases of HPAI
in wild birds in 2004/2005", which was included in FAO AIDE News,
Update on the Avian Influenza situation as of 10 Oct 2005, Issue no.

Additional and new data, including the detailed information from
Russian investigations, recently published in OIE's expert mission
report, as well as the recent cases in Croatia, might be expected to
be included in future updates of FAO-AIDE News.

A goose and a swan have reportedly tested positive for the H5 type of
bird flu in Romania on 31 Oct 2005 (see 20051031.3181). Details on
their precise identity (species), as well as of the Croatian
(Hungarian?) swans, will be appreciated.

The active involvement of ornithologists and zoologists in the study
of H5N1 epidemiology should be encouraged. -Mod. AS].
