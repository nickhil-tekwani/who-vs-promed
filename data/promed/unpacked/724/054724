The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Government of India claim that leprosy has been eliminated from the face of the earth. But the head of a rehabilitation centre for leprosy patients disagrees. Fr George Kannanthanam, Director, Sumanahalli Society for the [NGO] Welfare and Rehabilitation of Leprosy Patients, says, quoting a survey, that 2.28 lakh [lakh is a unit in the South Asian numbering system equal to 100 000] new cases of leprosy were reported in the world in 2010. Of them, 55 per cent or 1.27 lakh occurred in India alone. Of them, 15 000 cases were with deformities, and 5000 involved children.

As many as 4018 new cases were reported in Karnataka, including 419 in Bangalore. In 2011, the NGO reported and treated 131 new cases in the City. 23 of these cases were with deformities.

The disease might well be on its way out, but there is no room for complacency, Kannanthanam said in his welcome speech at the 35th anniversary celebration of the NGO [in Bangalore] on Tuesday [24 Jan 2012]. "The WHO and the GoI [Government of India] say leprosy has been eliminated, but that is not the reality,"_he pointed out. It may be recalled that WHO had declared, in 2010, that leprosy had been eliminated. Consequently, the Union government terminated the Survey, Education, and Treatment (SET) programme through which new cases of leprosy were detected and treated before they turned serious.

Kannanthanam said the termination of the SET programme caused a large number of cases to go undetected on time. Treating leprosy patients is now much more difficult as there is a dearth of sufficient infrastructure and facilities. Also, many agencies stopped their engagement in leprosy and the government cut down its programmes drastically, he added.

[Bangalore, also called Bengaluru, is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. Bangalore, with a population of 8.5 million in 2011, is India's third most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration and is well known as a hub for India's information technology sector (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore).

The Western Province [of Sri Lanka] records the highest number (42 percent) of leprosy patients in the country. The 2nd highest number of leprosy patients (13 percent) is recorded from the Eastern Province. North Western Province records the 3rd highest number (11 percent) of leprosy patients, Health Ministry additional secretary Dr Palitha Mahipala said. He said the Southern Province records 10 percent of the total number of leprosy patients reported in Sri Lanka.

"Around 2000 new leprosy patients are reported in Sri Lanka every year, although the country eliminated the disease in 1995 (according to WHO certification)," Dr Mahipala said. He said that the social marketing campaign implemented by Sri Lanka in 1989 to control leprosy made a significant progress and was recognized as one of the most successful social marketing campaigns in the world. "A 5 year programme is in progress in Sri Lanka to further strengthen treatment and detect leprosy," he said. National Leprosy Control Programme director Dr Nilanthi Fernando said that 9 percent of leprosy patients are children below the age of 15.

"10 percent of leprosy patients seek treatment after they get deformities. Around 56 percent of leprosy patients who seek treatment abandon treatment after 6 months. Another 30 percent do not turn up for treatment after the disease is diagnosed. Leprosy can be completely cured with treatment. Non-communicable leprosy needs treatment only for 6 months and communicable leprosy needs treatment for one year. Leprosy does not spread through patients undergoing treatment. Treatment is available at state hospitals free of charge," she said.

[The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Sri Lanka is available at http://healthmap.org/r/1A-B.

Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by a bacillus, _Mycobacterium leprae_ (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs101/en/). _M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years. Symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Leprosy is not highly contagious. But because lepromatous patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions, a case of untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for infection for close, long-term contacts, such as household members. Casual and short-term contact does not seem to spread the disease. As the organism is also present in skin lesions, skin contact is thought to be another mode of spread. Because the organisms that are shed by lepromatous patients can persist on surfaces in the environment, fomites are also a potential source of infection.

Drugs used to treat leprosy (dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine) are provided by WHO free to all patients in the world since 1995; see http://www.novartis.com/corporate-responsibility/access-to-healthcare/our-key-initiatives/eliminating-leprosy.shtml. Patients are no longer infectious after the 1st dose of the treatment regimen. Patients with paucibacillary leprosy treated with rifampin and dapsone are cured within 6 months and multibacillary patients treated with rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine are cured within 12 months.

When WHO says that leprosy has been "eliminated" in a region, they do not mean eliminated completely. WHO defines elimination of leprosy as a public health problem if the prevalence is less than one case per 10 000 population. The global disease burden fell from 5.2 million in 1985, to 805 000 in 1995, to 753 000 at the end of 1999, to about 219 826 cases at the end of 2005, with a prevalence rate of about 0.2 per 10 000 population. Globally, 296 499 new cases of leprosy were detected during 2005. In 2008, about 213 000 people mainly in Asia and Africa were infected, with approximately 249 000 new cases reported. New cases of leprosy among children, as reported in the news above reported from India and Sri Lanka, would be an indication of ongoing transmission in the community.

The South-East Asia Region (SEAR), including India and Sri Lanka, achieved the elimination goal in December 2005. The SEAR prevalence rate steadily declined from 4.6 per 10 000 population in 1996 to 0.82 per 10 000 population as of July 2006. The SEAR new case detection also declined from a peak of 47.8 per 100 000 in 1998 to 11.9 per 100 000 as of March 2006 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm). The 2005 prevalence rate in India was 0.88 per 10 000 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20_12162.htm) and in Sri Lanka 0.65 per 10 000 (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section54_12169.htm).
However, 2 countries in the SEAR, Nepal and Timor-Leste (East Timor) are yet to achieve elimination (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm).

However, pockets of high endemicity still remained in some areas of Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, and the United Republic of Tanzania. India, Brazil, and Indonesia are the 3 countries that have the greatest number of leprosy cases. The top 10 countries in new case detections in 2005 are India, Brazil, Indonesia, DR Congo, Bangladesh, Nepal, Mozambique, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. Together, they constitute about 96 percent of year 2005's global new case detections. The SEAR contributed about 69 percent of 2005 global new case detections.

WHO emphasizes that sustained political commitment and adequate resources for leprosy services are required, especially for currently under-served population groups such as remote rural areas, urban slums, migrant labor, to sustain elimination at national levels, and progress towards further reducing the burden of leprosy. Also strengthening integration of leprosy services into the general health system through capacity building and skill development is required to ensure and sustain quality leprosy services, including diagnosis and treatment and prevention/care of disabilities (http://www.searo.who.int/en/Section10/Section20/Section2293.htm). - Mod.ML]
