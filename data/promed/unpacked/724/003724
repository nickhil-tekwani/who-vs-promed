Outbreak of Malta fever contained
---------------------------------
Interior Minister Prince Naif demanded an immediate explanation, from both
Minister of Health, Dr. Hamad Al-Manie, and Minister of Agriculture, Dr.
Fahd Balghaneim, on measures taken by the 2 ministries to contain the
outbreak of Malta fever (brucellosis) in Jizan. He has also called for
details of the recent infection of livestock in the area with the same disease.
Information coming from Amoud village, in the Al-Reeth area of Jizan,
indicates that Maltese fever has infected adults and children, as well as
animals, in the region. Citizens had complained to the local branch of the
Agricultural Ministry, and had asked for their animals to be injected, but
the authorities apparently failed to respond.
Dr. Yakub Al-Mazrou, assistant deputy minister for preventive medicine in
the Ministry of Health, told the Saudi Press Agency that 25 cases of Malta
Fever had been recorded in the village in the Al-Reeth region between the
beginning of March 2004 to May 2004.
He said that Malta Fever is a zoonotic (transferable from animals to
humans) bacterial disease that affects animals, mainly, goats, camels,
dogs, and cattle. Transmission of the disease occurs by contact with
infected meat, placenta of infected animals, or, ingestion of
un-pasteurized milk or cheese. The illness may be chronic and persist for
years.
All cases have been treated in Beesh hospital, and no deaths were recorded.
In a coordinated program between health and agriculture ministries, the
necessary steps [have been taken] to inoculate animals to prevent the
disease from spreading to humans. Detecting infected animals controls the
infection at its source.
Vaccination is available for [livestock], but, not [for] humans. A
combination antibiotic therapy is the usual step to treat, and prevent,
relapse of infection [in humans]. Longer courses of therapy may be required
for complications.

[_B.melitensis_ is endemic in Saudi Arabia, as in all Near Eastern
countries. According to the most recent available Saudi OIE report on list
B diseases (2002), vaccination is the only measure applied there to control
brucellosis in animals (figures not presented). - Mod.AS]
