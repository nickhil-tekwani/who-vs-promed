South Korea says imported US cattle infected with blue tongue disease
---------------------------------------------------------------------
South Korea's National Veterinary Research & Quarantine Service (NVRQS)
said on Wednesday [5 Nov 2003] that 8 of 762 cattle imported from the
United States between 21 and 24 October have been found to be infected with
bluetongue disease, considered a first-grade cattle disease here.
The agency said it would again inspect and quarantine the rest of the 754
cattle, inform the US government of the infection, and request American
officials devise measures to prevent the reoccurrence of such an incident.
There has been no report of the disease among Korean cattle, according to
the NVRQS.

[Comments have been requested from USDA/APHIS/VS. It should be pointed out
that though it is claimed that these animals are "infected", the reality
may be that they merely demonstrated bluetongue antibodies. The mildness of
the official South Korean response would support such speculation. - Mod.MHJ]
