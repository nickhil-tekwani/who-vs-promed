While health officials undertake vaccination campaigns across West
Africa to control meningitis and polio epidemics, measles has
overtaken both diseases in Burkina Faso in the biggest outbreak the
country has seen in more than a decade, according to the Ministry of
Health. Considered the leading cause of death among children by the
World Health Organization (WHO), the preventable measles virus is
spread through coughing and sneezing.

Epidemiologist with Burkina Faso's Health Ministry Ousmane Badolo
told IRIN that, as of Sun 5 Apr 2009, more than 19 000 measles
infections have been reported, with 150 deaths. This is 10 times more
than the number of infections reported in any year since 1997. "We
are worried because we are facing a growing case load of measles." He
said the last comparable outbreak was in 1997 with 32 000 reported
cases.

Fenella Avokey, with a WHO inter-country support team based in
Burkina Faso, told IRIN the current measles outbreak is an exception
in a trend of declining infections worldwide. "We have not [seen]
this for quite a while. ... What we are seeing now is a bit
unprecedented compared to 5 years ago."

In 2007, an estimated 197 000 children died worldwide because of
measles, a 74 percent drop since 2000, according to WHO. Children
missing routine and mass vaccinations increase the chance of an
outbreak

The Measles Initiative, formed in 2001 by WHO, UN Children's Fund
(UNICEF), the American Red Cross, the US Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and the UN Foundation, has tried to slash
measles deaths through boosting money for vaccination and education
in 47 at-risk countries, including Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso's last
mass measles vaccination campaign was in December 2007 and reached
more than 3 million children aged 9 months to 5 years, according to
the government.

When asked about why there is a spike in measles infections this year
[2009], WHO's Avokey told IRIN that children missing routine and mass
vaccination campaigns increase the chance of an outbreak. "We fail to
vaccinate our children. And then we have a pool of susceptible
victims that builds up, and after a while they become easy prey for
the measles virus." Countries that have immunized only about 80
percent of their populations through routine and mass vaccinations
can expect to have large, sustained outbreaks every 3-4 years, while
those that immunize at least 95 percent of the population -- as in
Finland -- have not reported any outbreaks in recent years, according
to the Measles Initiative.

Burkina Faso will need to mass vaccinate soon, but the government
needs to determine who is falling ill, their ages, and where they
live in order to best control the spread, said the Health Ministry's
Badolo. "The most vulnerable will be vaccinated because we do not
have unlimited vaccines for the entire population," he said.

Routine measles immunizations that cost about USD 1.00 are
recommended at birth, to be followed by a booster shot to strengthen
immunity, as 15 percent of one-time vaccinations prove ineffective,
according to WHO. The Measles Initiative estimates that 11 million
people were saved from measles-related deaths in 2000-2007 through
government education and vaccination programs.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[The number of cases of measles in Burkina Faso (population
approximately 16 million) has risen from under 2000 in early February
2009 to the current estimate of 19 000 cases, and the number of
deaths has risen from 9 to 150. There appears to have been a lapse in
the comprehensive provision of routine childhood vaccination. This
setback following a period of sustained success is a great
disappointment for those involved.

The under-5 population of Burkina Faso in 2007 is estimated by WHO to
have been 2.7 million, so the December 2007 mass campaign should have
reached all of them. In that year the number of live births was also
estimated at 654 000 and the number of survivng infants at 586 000.
The rise in cases began in November 2008 (see ProMED ref. (02) below);
those were presumably not all in infants, or that fact would have been
noticed. Vaccine efficacy should be checked. - Mod.JW]
