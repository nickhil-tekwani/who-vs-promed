Outbreak and lethal cases due to mushroom poisoning
-----------------------------------------------
According to the Ministry of Health, during the period from 27-28 May 2005,
a mass-poisoning was registered in 2 villages (Alamudun, Sokoluk) in
Bishkek (the capital city of Kyrgyzstan). The poisoning was caused by wild
mushrooms. The number of poisonings stands at 27, 12 of them are children.
3 children have died, and one is in serious condition in the intensive care
unit.
In the Osh region, another part of Kyrgyzstan, mushroom poisoning was
registered among habitants of the Madi and Karasuy villages during 29-30
May 2005. There were 10 cases of poisoning; 3 children, aged 7, 8 and
10-years-old, died. 3 adults died as well.
The symptoms of mushroom poisoning develop from 3-24 hours after exposure.
The clinical signs include acute gastroenteritis, with vomiting, diarrhea
and abdominal pain. Renal and liver failure might develop and eventually
lead to a lethal outcome.

[There are many types of mushrooms which may be toxic. However, poisonings
with many of these toxic fungi present with similar clinical signs, at
least initially.
According to the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and
Applied Nutrition: (see the Bad Bug Book at
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap40.html>)
"Mushroom poisoning is caused by the consumption of raw or cooked fruiting
bodies (mushrooms, toadstools) of a number of species of higher fungi. The
term toadstool (from the German Todesstuhl, death's stool) is commonly
given to poisonous mushrooms, but for individuals who are not experts in
mushroom identification, there are generally no easily recognizable
differences between poisonous and nonpoisonous species. Old wives' tales
notwithstanding, there is no general rule of thumb for distinguishing
edible mushrooms and poisonous toadstools.
The toxins involved in mushroom poisoning
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/cgi-bin/bbbglos?Toxins> are produced naturally by
the fungi themselves, and each individual specimen of a toxic species
should be considered equally poisonous. Most mushrooms that cause human
poisoning cannot be made nontoxic by cooking, canning, freezing, or any
other means of processing. Thus, the only way to avoid poisoning is to
avoid consumption of the toxic species. Poisonings in the United States
occur most commonly when hunters of wild mushrooms (especially novices)
misidentify and consume a toxic species, when recent immigrants collect and
consume a poisonous American species that closely resembles an edible wild
mushroom from their native land, or when mushrooms that contain
psychoactive compounds are intentionally consumed by persons who desire
these effects.
Nature of the disease:
Mushroom poisonings are generally acute and are manifested by a variety of
symptoms and prognoses, depending on the amount and species consumed.
Because the chemistry of many of the mushroom toxins (especially the less
deadly ones) is still unknown and positive identification of the mushrooms
is often difficult or impossible, mushroom poisonings are generally
categorized by their physiological effects. There are 4 categories of
mushroom toxins: protoplasmic poisons (poisons that result in generalized
destruction of cells, followed by organ failure); neurotoxins (compounds
that cause neurological symptoms, such as profuse sweating, coma
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/cgi-bin/bbbglos?Coma>, convulsions
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/cgi-bin/bbbglos?Convulsions>, hallucinations,
excitement, depression, spastic colon); gastrointestinal irritants
(compounds that produce rapid, transient nausea, vomiting, abdominal
cramping, and diarrhea); and disulfiram-like toxins. Mushrooms in this last
category are generally nontoxic and produce no symptoms unless alcohol is
consumed within 72 hours after eating them, in which case a short-lived
acute toxic syndrome is produced." - Mod.TG]
