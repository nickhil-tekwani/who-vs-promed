[1] Case update
- Sat 13 Oct 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health
[in French, machine trans., edited]

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 12 Oct 2018:
- A total of 207 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 172 were confirmed and 35 were probable.
- Of the 172 confirmed, 95 died, and 54 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different installed Ebola Treatment Centers (ETCs).
- Number of suspect cases not available today.
- 2 new cases confirmed in Beni.
- No new deaths.

News of the response
Press conference of the Minister of Health in Kinshasa
------------------------------------------------------
- The minister of health, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, held a press conference at his cabinet this Saturday [13 Oct 2018] to present the evolution of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri.
- Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga reviewed the latest developments in the Beni epidemic, which is now the main focus. He highlighted the factors that have slowed down the progress of the response in the city, namely community resistance, insecurity, dead city days, and the lack of involvement of traditional healers. This situation has created a gray area for the response teams. Due to difficulties in identifying and following up contacts, the majority of new confirmed cases reported this month [October 2018] are not part of the list of known contacts, and epidemiological links are identified only after a thorough investigation. Thus, only the continuation of the investigations will allow us to determine the real extent of this 2nd wave of confirmed cases in Beni.
- However, there are positive developments, including a significant increase in the number of alerts received and investigated per day. This indicates a strengthening of surveillance.
- Faced with these challenges, coordination has begun to develop a new response plan that takes into account these additional dimensions related to realities on the ground. This new approach is based on co-targeting, which aims to ensure that concerted actions are carried out by multidisciplinary teams around cases and alerts. In addition, the city of Beni has been divided into 18 operational zones that correspond to the 18 health areas of the city with specific response teams.

Vaccination
----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 16 518 people have been vaccinated, including 6453 in Beni [North Kivu], 4315 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1392 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1085 in Butembo [North Kivu], 460 in Masereka [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 121 in Oicha [North Kivu].

[The situation has become very difficult, which is distressing after there had appeared to be so much hope towards the end of the 1st wave. What is concerning is the statement that "due to difficulties in identifying and following up contacts, the majority of new confirmed cases reported this month [October 2018] are not part of the list of known contacts, and epidemiological links are identified only after a thorough investigation. Thus, only the continuation of the investigations will allow us to determine the real extent of this 2nd wave of confirmed cases in Beni."

It is not clear to me whether the "increase in the number of alerts received and investigated per day" actually indicates a "strengthening of surveillance" or rather a real increase in number of cases and possibly new chains of transmission. It would be difficult to distinguish between the latter possibility and improved surveillance. - Mod.LK]

- Fri 12 Oct 2018. Ebola DR Congo cases rise to 200, says WHO, of which 125 have died. 35 new cases in the week, of which 29 reside in Beni.
[Radio Monte Carlo, in Spanish, trans., edited]

The World Health Organization (WHO) said today [12 Oct 2018] that they have reached 200 cases of Ebola in the current outbreak that is registered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which 125 have died, confirming again the high mortality that causes this sickness.

The epidemic outbreak takes place in the province of North Kivu and has been concentrated in recent weeks in one of its 3 main cities, Beni, where 82% of new cases come from, said the spokesman of the organization, Tarik Jasarevic.

A total of 35 infected people were counted in the last week, of which 29 reside in Beni, where WHO anticipated that they will now concentrate their efforts.

One of the central reasons for the spread of the virus in the eastern city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is insecurity, the spokesperson recalled. North Kivu, like other adjoining provinces, is the scene of an armed conflict involving government forces and various rebel armed factions. A recent attack that left several civilians dead forced the WHO to suspend for some days its activities of epidemiological surveillance, monitoring of people who had contact with sick people, as well as vaccination.

"The attacks are not aimed at workers who fight Ebola, but they do not allow teams to run at full capacity on a daily basis; sometimes they can go to certain areas only a couple of hours because there are protests or exchange of shots," explained Jasarevic.

A part of the population of that area of the DRC has shown distrust and reluctance to follow the recommendations of the WHO to stop the transmission of Ebola, either by the consequences caused by decades of conflict or by local beliefs.

"We continue to see cases of people who 1st go to healers who combine modern and traditional medicine; [ill people] are slow to go to treatment centers, which makes it harder to save their lives," the spokesman said.

To control this outbreak, 150 000 people -- including health workers -- have been vaccinated against Ebola, and 8000 people are followed up with who kept in contact with the sick while they were incubating the virus or when they started showing symptoms.

- Fri 12 Oct 2018. United Nations employee in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has tested positive for Ebola, the 1st such incident during the current outbreak, says head of UN Peacekeeping
[The Guardian, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/12/un-employee-in-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-tests-positive-for-ebola

A United Nations employee in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has tested positive for Ebola, the 1st such incident during the current outbreak, according to the head of the UN peacekeeping mission.

"I am writing today to inform you that my leadership team and I have regretfully just received news that a UN colleague based in Beni has tested positive for Ebola and is now receiving the necessary medical treatment," Leila Zerrougui wrote in the letter seen by Reuters.

Zerrougui said the employee had not been to work for several weeks and that tracing the person's contacts had begun.

The news came after health officials warned that the rate of new Ebola cases had more than doubled since September after rebel violence in northeastern DRC caused response efforts to be briefly suspended, health officials said on Thursday [11 Oct 2018].

The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said it was alarmed that there were 33 new cases between 1 Oct and 9 Oct 2018, compared with 41 cases during all of September [2018].

Most of the new cases have been in Beni, where experts had to suspend Ebola containment efforts for days after a deadly rebel attack. With multiple armed groups active in the region, health officials have said they are effectively operating in a war zone.

"This is a sign not only that the outbreak is not under control, but that without full engagement from the community things could get a lot worse," said Dr Michelle Gayer, the IRC's senior director of emergency health.

Earlier this week, the World Health Organization said that 19 of the health workers who had caught Ebola in this epidemic had been infected outside of hospitals or clinics, meaning the virus is spreading in the community.

WHO warned that the risk of Ebola's regional spread was very high, pointing out that DRC's affected North Kivu and Ituri provinces share borders with Uganda and Rwanda. WHO said the risk for international spread remained low.

[2] Hijacked hearse
Date: Fri 12 Oct 2018
Source: National Public Radio: The Hijacked Hearse: Dispatches from the Ebola Outbreak in DRC [edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/10/12/657012745/the-hijacked-hearse-dispatches-from-the-ebola-outbreak-in-drc


As Ebola continues to spread through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the government has been issuing daily updates. These press releases are mainly a recitation of facts and figures: The total number of confirmed cases since the outbreak was declared August 1: 165 as of Friday [12 Oct 2018] [N.B. now 172 confirmed cases]. The death toll: 90 people [N.B. now 95 deaths]. The number of individuals who've been given an experimental vaccine: 15 807. And a summary of the latest efforts by responders to reach affected communities.

But for all the dry language in these dispatches, every so often they offer a vivid glimpse of a tumultuous, high-stakes drama that is playing out almost daily as health workers and safe burial teams seek to win over communities who are deeply mistrustful of intentions.

The accounts speak of tense negotiations with village leaders and of patients who refuse treatment and flee, only to be found days later, on the brink of death, in a city several hours away.

Then came Friday's [12 Oct 2018] release, which included a story so compelling that we've translated it here from the original French (and lightly edited it for clarity).[See full report for exact translation of story, at URL provided above, and see ProMED-mail Ebola update (109): Congo DR (NK, IT) case update, DNA vaccine 20181013.6088789 for report on incident - Mod LK].

In addition, residents of the Butsili neighborhood where the family lived held an extraordinary meeting on Thursday [11 Oct 2018] at a local office. They apologized to the Ebola response team and promised they would not let such a situation happen again.

[This was an extraordinary event for so many reasons, the 1st being that the response team allowed the hearse to be driven by one of the acquaintances [of the woman who died, as long as] 5 family members be given personal protective equipment so that they could be the ones to carry the casket, and with the provision that a police-car escort would follow. The 2nd reason is that the hearse with the coffin was hijacked by the driver to a family plot in the Butsili district of Beni instead of the official cemetery. This demonstrated how strong the cultural practices are ingrained in the people, even in the face of a known health threat. But wisdom and education overrode this temptation, and the driver turned around, unfortunately not before they were attacked by angry nearby neighborhood youth. It is not clear what the youth were angry about, since the burial was now going to take place in the community family plot. Finally, several members of the family voluntarily presented themselves at the hospital to get vaccinated against Ebola, demonstrating they knew very well the danger of the situation and had trust in the response team. - Mod.LK
