[According to the report above, a total of 80 793 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from China, representing an increase of 15 cases in the past 24 hours, of which 8 (53.3%) were in Hubei province. It is the 3rd consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China. In addition, 11 deaths were reported, 10 (90.9%) of them by Hubei province. Nine new cases were reported from Hong Kong.

Most noteworthy is that 6 (40%) of the 15 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China (3 in Guangdong, 2 in Gansu, and 1 in Henan) bringing the total number of imported cases to 85. A challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission within China.

What China has accomplished in less than 3 months is very impressive...detecting a new disease, identifying the etiologic agent, developing diagnostic tools, and interrupting most chains of transmission.... There are lessons to be learned. One key challenge was detecting when the zoonotic disease with isolated probable species jumps developed person-to-person transmission ease and the number of cases skyrocketed, recognizing needs for surge capacity, and responding asap (as soon as possible). The analogous situation can be said of the transmission in the Middle East, Europe, the USA, and the Western Pacific region -- detecting when the transition from isolated imported cases to community-based transmission occurred; countries are still trying to meet the needed surge capacity; and attempting to slow down the community based transmission.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 12 462, including 827 deaths, up from 10 149 cases and 631 deaths reported on 10 Mar 2020. The 24 hour change between 10 and 11 Mar 2020 was 2313 newly confirmed cases, compared with 977 newly confirmed cases between 9 and 10 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (7280), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (1739), and Venice (1023), all in the northern part of the country. These 3 provinces account for 80.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020 this was changed to be country wide. Today (11 Mar 2020), Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses.

''Italy will always remain a unique, protected area, but now let's take a step further: we have the closure of commercial activities, with the exception of those for basic necessities and pharmacies." So live on Facebook the premier Giuseppe Conte announces new more restrictive measures to counter the coronavirus emergency, valid for 2 weeks. The measure will be published in the Official Journal.

"The activities of bars, pubs, and restaurants are therefore suspended. Hairdressers, beauty centers, and canteen services are closed. Food stores, petrol stations, newsagents, and tobacconists will remain open. Industries will remain open but with "security measures", that is, provided they guarantee measures to avoid contagion. On the other hand, the "non-essential" production departments are closed. The regulation of work shifts and early holidays is also encouraged.

"A delegate commissioner arrives to strengthen the health structures put under stress due to the growing number of infections: 'He will be a commissioner who will have full powers of derogation and who will work to strengthen the distribution of intensive care equipment. I will appoint Domenico Arcuri, the man at the helm of Invitalia.'" (Invitalia is the National Agency for Inward Investment and Economic Development. It is owned by the Italian Ministry of Economy.)
(http://www.salute.gov.it/portale/news/p3_2_1_1_1.jsp?lingua=italiano&menu=notizie&p=dalministero&id=4212) (in Italian).

It appears as though the government planned a staged almost total lockdown, in response to a rapidly increasing case and fatality count.

As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 9000 cases, 354 deaths
Date: Wed 11 Mar 2020 5:57 PM IRST

Iran on Wednesday [11 Mar 2020] reported 63 new deaths from the novel coronavirus, the highest single-day toll in the 3 weeks since the Islamic republic announced the 1st deaths from the outbreak. The outbreak of the coronavirus in Iran is one of the deadliest outside China, where the disease originated.

"Based on new lab results, we have identified 958 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in the country, bringing the total number of cases to 9000," health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference. "Unfortunately in the past 24 hours, we have had reports of 63 deaths and overall 354 have lost their lives" to the virus, he added.

The capital Tehran had the most new infections with 256 cases. The central province of Isfahan followed with 170, and Semnan, to the east of Tehran, had 63. Bushehr as well as Kohgiluyeh and Boyerahmad in the southwest had no new cases.

Iran announced its 1st coronavirus deaths, in the Shiite holy city of Qom, on [19 Feb 2020]. It is yet to officially impose quarantines but authorities have repeatedly called on people to refrain from travelling. They have closed schools and universities and resorted to shutting hotels and other tourist accommodation to discourage travel.

Jahanpour said the number of infections was still on the rise and that Iran would not be "celebrating the end of coronavirus" during the country's new year holidays, which start on [20 Mar 2020].

President Hassan Rouhani also called on people to limit their movements in order to contain the virus. "Movements must be reduced to the possible minimum, unless it is absolutely necessary," Rouhani said during a cabinet meeting, flanked by ministers wearing masks. "Everyone must pay attention to protocols and be careful so the virus's spread can be contained," he added. Rouhani also warned against "exaggerating" the number of dead through non-official tolls and causing "fear and anxiety" among the public.

Apart from direct fatalities, 84 people have died from methanol poisoning in Iran after rumours circulated that drinking alcohol can help cure or protect from the virus. In some provinces such as Khuzestan in the southwest, the death toll from poisoning is higher than that from the coronavirus.

[In the 24 hours from 10 to 11 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 8042 to 9000 an increase of 958 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 291 to 354, an increase of 63 deaths in the 24 hour period.

Qom, while the apparent original epicenter of this outbreak, is located to the south west of Tehran in central Iran. Tehran is now considered as the epicenter of the outbreak with an increase of 256 confirmed cases from 10 Mar to 11 Mar 2020. Cases have now been confirmed in all of the 31 provinces in the country.

[5] Pandemic declared: WHO Director General
Date: Wed 11 Mar 2020
Source: WHO Director General Briefing [edited]
https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---11-march-2020


In the past 2 weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased 13-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled. There are now more than 118 000 cases in 114 countries, and 4291 people have lost their lives. Thousands more are fighting for their lives in hospitals. In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries climb even higher.

WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.

We have therefore made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic.

Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly. It is a word that, if misused, can cause unreasonable fear, or unjustified acceptance that the fight is over, leading to unnecessary suffering and death. Describing the situation as a pandemic does not change WHO's assessment of the threat posed by this virus. It doesn't change what WHO is doing, and it doesn't change what countries should do.

We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus. This is the 1st pandemic caused by a coronavirus. And we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled, at the same time. WHO has been in full response mode since we were notified of the 1st cases. And we have called every day for countries to take urgent and aggressive action. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear.

As I said on Monday [9 Mar 2020], just looking at the number of cases and the number of countries affected does not tell the full story. Of the 118 000 cases reported globally in 114 countries, more than 90 percent of cases are in just 4 countries, and 2 of those - China and the Republic of Korea - have significantly declining epidemics. 81 countries have not reported any cases, and 57 countries have reported 10 cases or less.

We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. Even those countries with community transmission or large clusters can turn the tide on this virus. Several countries have demonstrated that this virus can be suppressed and controlled.

The challenge for many countries who are now dealing with large clusters or community transmission is not whether they can do the same -- it's whether they will. Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve.

We are grateful for the measures being taken in Iran, Italy, and the Republic of Korea to slow the virus and control their epidemics. We know that these measures are taking a heavy toll on societies and economies, just as they did in China. All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic and social disruption, and respecting human rights.

WHO's mandate is public health. But we're working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this pandemic. This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector - so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight.

I have said from the beginning that countries must take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact.

Let me summarize it in 4 key areas.
- prepare and be ready;
- detect, protect, and treat;
- reduce transmission; and
- innovate and learn.

I remind all countries that we are calling on you to activate and scale up your emergency response mechanisms:
- communicate with your people about the risks and how they can protect themselves -- this is everybody's business;
- find, isolate, test, and treat every case and trace every contact;
- ready your hospitals; and
- protect and train your health workers.

And let's all look out for each other, because we need each other. There's been so much attention on one word.

Let me give you some other words that matter much more, and that are much more actionable:
- prevention;
- preparedness;
- public health;
- political leadership;
- and most of all, people.

We're in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It's doable.

[WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.]

[Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was very direct in his briefing. Declaring this a pandemic is just putting a word to what has been observed -- transmission in multiple countries, in multiple regions of the world. But he's also correct in his statement that this pandemic can be mitigated. Taking what he said a step further, denial of transmission in a country in the early stages is a recipe for failure. Transmission can be slowed and potentially interrupted by early detection of all cases, isolation with good infection control measures on the part of the healthcare personnel, and good risk communication to the public to understand how they could aid in interrupting transmission.

Reviewing the media on a daily basis, I have seen the politicization of these epidemics within countries, especially on the part of leaders and their oppositions and seen how this is counterproductive to say the least. Those mixed messages to the public lead to lack of trust and confidence in advice given by the official public health sector. Mistakes and errors will happen; trying to cast blame on others for political gain makes everyone a loser as the trust is eroded. Admitting there were errors and correcting them builds trust. And dealing with a 1st documented pandemic of a coronavirus means every day is a learning day, and we should learn from our mistakes. - Mod.MPP]

[6] Denmark: lockdown measures

[Denmark has gone into a general 14-day lockdown to halt the spread of coronavirus after a 10-fold spike in cases.]

The Scandinavian country will close all schools and universities and inform all workers with non-critical jobs to [work] from home.

Denmark had 514 [persons] identified with the [virus] as of Wednesday [11 Mar 2020], increasing 10-fold since [Mon 9 Mar 2020] in what Health Minister Magnus Heunicke described as the "most dramatic increase seen in Europe." 2 patients are in serious condition.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen mentioned all students at schools and universities might be sent home from Friday [13 Mar 2020], whilst all day care amenities might be closed from Monday [16 Mar 2020].

Gatherings of greater than 100 individuals are banned, that means bars and nightclubs will shut.

She mentioned: "We won't get thru this as a country with no value. Businesses will endure losses and folks will lose their jobs. The executive will do what it can to assist.

"Everyone who is healthy, we have a great responsibility towards the vulnerable."

She mentioned different harder measures have been contemplated as well as banning cruise passengers.

The measure comes after former Italian PM Matteo Renzi warned each country in Europe must apply the overall lockdown in their home country.

https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/denmark-strong-anti-coronavirus-measures-recession-likely-202003120640


The Danish government has announced a series of measures to dampen the spread of the coronavirus. Among them are the following:
- all non-critical public employees are sent home with pay;
- all private employers are asked to keep employees home if possible;
- schools, universities, day care, etc., are closed.;
- the government asks that events with more than 100 people be cancelled and that bars, nightclubs, etc., be closed -- within a few days, they expect to have the legal mandate to demand it.

These measures are in place for 2 weeks, but may be extended.

The background is that Denmark has seen a sharp increase in the number of infected persons in the past few days. There are now 514 confirmed cases, of which 2 are in critical condition, against 90 cases 2 days ago. The increase appears to be largely related to people who have travelled to Tyrol in Austria and authorities do not at this point suspect widespread domestic contagion. Nevertheless, the disease clearly poses a potential danger to the Danish healthcare system at this point.

We expect the economic impact to be very significant in the short run. Public service excluding healthcare represents 20.1% of employment and 15.7% of GDP. The decline in measured production will be smaller, as some can work from home and for example teaching might be done remotely. On the other hand, private production will be disrupted by workers staying home either to prevent contagion or to take care of children. There is set to be a large decline in GDP in Q1. It might not decline further in Q2 and hence a technical recession might not happen, but the setback will be so large that this is likely a recession in non-technical terms. For 2020 as a whole we expected 1.4% growth in our latest full forecast from 3 January. An estimate today might be something closer to 0.5%, with a clear risk that GDP will actually decline in 2020.

The new measures clearly represent a large supply shock to the Danish economy, but we also think that the economy is facing a significant demand shock from reduced spending not least on travel and leisure. The balance is likely to tip after 15 months of unchanged unemployment (including January [2020]), so we will see higher unemployment this year [2020].

The new measures will clearly affect some businesses very severely and some, in tourism and travel for example, were already suffering. The government has announced a postponement of companies' payment of VAT and payroll taxes, which could boost liquidity and help companies survive. It is likely that more measures are coming, which could include support for credit to affected industries or a reduction of the countercyclical capital buffer. It would also make sense for the government to support demand through a fiscal easing, as the economy will not be supported from monetary policy, which is as always only targeting the exchange rate.

[Denmark is following Italy's lead in terms of implementing a lockdown for one incubation period to see if it could slow down transmission of the ARS-CoV-2 in the country. Like Italy, the world will be watching to learn from Denmark and Italy's experience. Many European countries are in similar circumstances with significant increases in numbers of cases -- France and Spain have passed the 2000 mark in cases and Germany is almost at 2000 cases. - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10 am CET.

Highlights
----------
- WHO Director-General in his regular media briefing today [11 Mar 2020] stated that WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock and we are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction. WHO therefore have made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic. For detailed information, [see section [5] above].

- Four new countries/territories/areas (Bolivia [Plurinational State of], Jamaica, Burkina Faso and Democratic Republic of the Congo) have reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.

- The COVID-19 virus infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that 2 groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people; and those with underlying medical conditions. WHO emphasizes that all must protect themselves from COVID-19 in order to protect others. For more information, please see 'subject in focus'.

- On [10 Mar 2020], the IFRC, UNICEF, and WHO issued a new guidance to help protect children and schools from transmission of the COVID-19 virus. The guidance provides critical considerations and practical checklists to keep schools safe. More information can be found at https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/10-03-2020-covid-19-ifrc-unicef-and-who-issue-guidance-to-protect-children-and-support-safe-school-operations.

Subject in focus: Risk Communication guidance -- COVID-19, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The virus that causes COVID-19 infects people of all ages. However, evidence to date suggests that 2 groups of people are at a higher risk of getting severe COVID-19 disease. These are older people (that is people over 60 years old); and those with underlying medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer). The risk of severe disease gradually increases with age starting from around 40 years. It's important that adults in this age range protect themselves and in turn protect others that may be more vulnerable.

WHO has issued advice for these 2 groups and for community support to ensure that they are protected from COVID-19 without being isolated, stigmatized, left in a position of increased vulnerability, or unable to access basic provisions and social care. This advice covers the subject of receiving visitors, planning for supplies of medication and food, going out safely in public, and staying connected with others through phone calls or other means. It is essential that these groups are supported by their communities during the COVID-19 outbreak. WHO emphasizes that all people must protect themselves from COVID-19, which will also protect other.

Key advice for older adults and people with pre-existing conditions:
- When you have visitors to your home, exchange "1 metre [3 ft] greetings", like a wave, nod, or bow.
- Ask visitors and those you live with to wash their hands.
- Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces in your home, especially areas that people touch a lot.
- If someone you live with isn't feeling well (especially with possible COVID-19 symptoms), limit your shared spaces.
- If you become ill with symptoms of COVID-19, contact your healthcare provider by telephone before visiting your healthcare facility.
- Make a plan in preparation for an outbreak of COVID-19 in your community.
- When you go out in public, follow the same preventative guidelines as you would at home.
- Stay up to date using information from reliable sources.

Note: Numbers include both domestic and repatriated cases.
*The designations employed and the presentation of the material in this publication do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of WHO concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Dotted and dashed lines on maps represent approximate border lines for which there may not yet be full agreement.
**Case classifications are based on WHO case definitions for COVID-19.
***Transmission classification is based on WHO analysis of available official data and may be subject to reclassification as additional data become available. Countries/territories/areas experiencing multiple types of transmission are classified in the highest category for which there is evidence; they may be removed from a given category if interruption of transmission can be demonstrated. It should be noted that even within categories, different countries/territories/areas may have differing degrees of transmission as indicated by the differing numbers of cases and other factors. Not all locations within a given country/territory/area are equally affected.

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of sentinel samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

****"Territories" include territories, areas, overseas dependencies, and other jurisdictions of similar status

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 113. This includes 11 countries from the Western Pacific region, 51 countries (including 3 territories) from the European region, 8 countries from the Southeast Asia region, 16 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Americas region, and 8 countries from the African region. 66 countries/territories are listed as having local transmission within their countries, with Paraguay, Serbia, Albania, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia newly reporting local transmission. Local transmission and clusters of cases were also noted on the cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan (the Diamond Princess) and the cruise ship on the Nile in Egypt.

The total number of cases reported from outside of China is now 37 371 including 1130 deaths.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time I've accessed the Johns Hopkins website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
