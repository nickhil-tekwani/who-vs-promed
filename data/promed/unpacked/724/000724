Testing performed by the Department of Agriculture Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) laboratory has confirmed _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Bareilly contamination in recalled yellowfin tuna and in a spicy tuna roll made with the recalled tuna. The Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene (WSLH) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that the organism isolated from these samples matched the DNA fingerprint of the outbreak _S._ Bareilly strain isolated from ill individuals. These lab tests confirmed earlier evidence discovered through case interviews and product tracking that the yellowfin tuna was the source of the contamination. To date, the outbreak of _S._ Bareilly infections has involved 160 ill individuals in 20 states and the District of Columbia.

Both of the contaminated samples were collected and tested as part of a collaborative effort in which Wisconsin state and local officials assisted federal investigators. On 13 Apr 2012, the Moon Marine USA Corporation (also known as MMI) of Cupertino, California voluntarily recalled all frozen raw yellowfin tuna product, labeled as Nakaochi Scrape AA or AAA. The product was not available for sale to individual consumers but may have been used to make sushi, sashimi, ceviche and similar dishes available in restaurants and grocery stores. The Food and Drug Administration is continuing to trace the recalled tuna forward from the recalling company through the subsequent distribution.

Since February 2012, 15 Wisconsin residents have had laboratory-confirmed _S._ Bareilly infections that match the DNA fingerprints of the national outbreak strain. Three of the 15 patients were hospitalized, and all of the patients have recovered from their infection.

County cases: Milwaukee 6; Washington 2; Waukesha 7.
