First case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in Westchester

WHITE PLAINS - The first case ever of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in a horse in Westchester County was announced on Friday. The privately owned horse in Bedford had recently traveled out of state to an area where EEE is more common.

The horse developed neurological symptoms and was put down. It was later tested and results confirmed the horse had the disease, a mosquito-borne illness.

The State Health Department said given the recent travel history of the horse, it most likely was infected outside Westchester. The county Health Department conducted an environmental assessment in the area and around the private stable where the horse boarded but found no signs of mosquito breeding activity.

"This is a serious disease in horses, but the risk to people is quite low," said Dr. Douglas Aspros, president of the Westchester County Board of Health and a veterinarian. "The viruses that cause this disease and other related diseases are responsible for only sporadic illness, and only occasionally are cases reported in horses and birds in southern New York State. The infection is unusual in animals and it is even rarer for it to cause illness in people."

According to state health department records kept since 1959, there has never been a human case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis in the New York metropolitan area, which includes Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Sullivan, Dutchess, Ulster, Orange, Nassau and Suffolk counties.

Equine Encephalitis Found in Northwest Wisconsin

MADISON - Another case of the mosquito-borne disease called Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE, has been confirmed, this time in a horse in Polk County.

This latest confirmation is prompting another warning from the Wisconsin State Veterinarian's office and a health advisory from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services.

Blood samples from a quarter horse were submitted to Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on Aug. 30 and confirmed today.

The State Veterinarian, Dr. Robert Ehlenfeldt, issued the first warning Aug. 21 after the office received notification that two horses in Clark and Lincoln Counties had been sickened with EEE.

"Vaccinate your horses if you haven't already, or get boosters for those you vaccinated earlier in the year," says Assistant State Veterinarian Dr. Paul McGraw. "EEE has a mortality rate in excess of 90 percent. The vaccine is not expensive, it's effective, and if we've found EEE in these 3 counties, it's reasonable to assume it's more widespread. Unless we have a really early killing frost, we still have a lot of mosquito season ahead of us."

In addition to vaccination, horse owners can take steps to reduce their animals' exposure to mosquitoes. If possible, owners should also keep their animals inside barns if possible from dusk through dawn, when mosquitoes are most active.

Signs in horses include depression, loss of appetite, drooping eyelids and lower lip, aimless wandering and circling, blindness and sometimes paralysis. There is no cure for horses; the disease must run its course. Most animals die or must be euthanized, but a few recover.

EEE is caused by a virus transmitted by mosquito bite to horses, birds, and humans. The virus is not transmitted between animals or between animals and humans. But the presence of an EEE positive horse confirms that there are infected mosquitoes in the area that could possibly transmit the virus to people and other animals.

Most people infected with the EEE virus do not have symptoms, according to Dr. Henry Anderson, State Health Officer. However, some infected people develop encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) that typically begins with sudden onset of fever, headache, chills, and vomiting. The illness may become severe, resulting in disorientation, seizures, coma, or death.

There is no specific treatment, other than treating symptoms. People who suspect they have EEE illness should contact their healthcare provider. EEE and West Nile virus are both currently circulating, and Wisconsin residents and state visitors should take measures to prevent mosquito bites.

The best way to avoid mosquito-borne diseases is to reduce exposure to mosquitoes and eliminate mosquito breeding sites.

When cold weather arrives the mosquitoes will be eliminated, but until then
people are urged to take these measures to protect themselves:
*Maintain window screens in good repair to decrease indoor contact with mosquitoes.
*Avoid being outside during times of high mosquito activity, specifically around dawn and dusk.
*Wear protective clothing such as long pants, loose-fitting long-sleeved shirts.
*When outdoors, consider using an effective mosquito repellent (follow instructions). For CDC repellents information, go to: http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/qa/insect_repellent.htm.
*Do not provide breeding sites for mosquitoes-remove containers, old tires, unused wading pools, and any objects where water can collect and mosquitoes can lay eggs.
*Empty standing water from bird baths. Trim tall grass, weeds and vines because mosquitoes use these sites to rest during hot daylight hours.

*Clean gutters and downspouts to ensure they drain properly. In 2011, the EEE virus caused one reported human illness (which was fatal) and 34 reported animal deaths (31 horses, 2 alpacas, and 1 pheasant). The human EEE case was only the second case known to have occurred in Wisconsin since 1984.

[I am always amused when journalists say a disease is rare and ProMED-mail and other sources are posting on it daily on this disease in horses. EEE in horses could be rare if everyone vaccinated their animals. A very effective vaccine is available and usually is combined with one of the other viruses that are mosquito transmitted, like West Nile Virus.

The mosquito transmits the disease. The horse cannot transmit the disease, but can die from the disease.

The disease is rare in humans, but not nearly so rare in horses and other animals that are susceptible to the virus.
