The exact reference for "un cas de tremblante sur un boeuf" is "Revue de
medecine veterinaire, 1883,7,310-313 and the author was a veterinarian,
Sarradet. The first clinical sign was prurit in this case with an evolution
to paralysis. Without histology - the first description of histopathology of
scrapie was made by the French Besnoit (veterinarian) and Morel in 1898 - we
cannot say that it is surely BSE but the veterinarian Sarradet conclude that
it was "scrapie".
The hypothesis of sporadic BSE in the world (like sporadic or familial
Creutfedt-Jakob disease) is credible. I am not sure that the origin of BSE
in United-Kindom was a ovine strain of scrapie but we don't know. The
concept that some sporadic CJD in humans might long have had a dietary
origin is also plausible. This concept prove that the transmission is rarely
seen when ther is not an "infectious pressure".
There is probably very sporadic cases of BSE in some part of the world (very
difficult to find because we know the difficulties of the diagnosis and of
the declaration of BSE). For exemple, remember the suspicion in 1985 of BSE
[actually a putative bovine TSE, not BSE which is presently specific
European disease in "downers cows" in USA (with natural contamination of
Mink).

against all the objects that it found in its stall. In the barn, it rubbed
with a veritable furor against the stall or against its restraint; in the
pasture, against all the trees that it could find; shackled, against the
front part of the post where, if it could not reach, it contorted itself to
scratch against the stanchion.<<

It seems that francophone cattle are prone to scratching symptoms. :-)
5% of the Swiss BSE cattle showed severe scratching symptoms, 17% milder
ones. (BOVINE SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY (BSE): CLINICAL SIGNS IN SWISS BSE
CASES; B. Hoernlimann and U. Brown; 1994). The authors state that this sign
was typical
for Swiss BSE cases.
I fear scratching indicates that the agent has wandered from the central
nervous system to the periphery (skin). This would imply an increased risk
for the gelatine production of skins.

A translation of the following exchange in a French Chat room is offered as
a sidelight on the 1881/83 BSE in France article of which Tom recently
obtained a copy.
It would seem improbable, given its highly infectious and quickly lethal
nature, that an animal infected with rabies would find its way into any food
chain without relatively immediate and obvious consequences to someone along
that chain (farmer, slaugherhouse, butcher, consumer). Could there be a
native French "vache enrag√©e" to match the UKs "vache folle," as the French
translate mad cow disease; one which was once so common that its presence
has fallen into the lexicon in an abstract expression? Certainly eating a
mad cow now and then a 100 or more years ago probably presented little risk
of dying from any form of CJD - few people, and almost no one in the lower
socio-economic level which would have been reduced to eating enraged cows,
would live beyond the age of 45 anyway.
The ox mentioned in 1881/83 was found in the Haute-Garonne. Two of the most
recent cases of BSE in France were located in the Haute-Loire and
Haute-Saone regions. From my limited map, it appears there could be as
little as 150 miles (and 117 years) separating the Haute-Garonne and
Haute-Loire locations. I wonder what the geographic distribution of the 34
reported BSE cases in France is?
"Eating Enraged Cows"
It appears that the ox in question [1881/83 scrapie in an ox was sold as
cheap meat.
Maybe that's what the French expression: "To eat enraged cow" means. [Note:
The French word for rabies is 'la rage'. However, the verb enrager has
pretty much the same meaning in French as English - to be enraged, angry,
agitated. It's an expression in and of itself. It's used when people are
poor and can't afford good meat. Other similar expressions are "to be in
mashed potatoes" and "to pull the devil by the tail" or "to be broke."
Where and when does the expression come from?
I just explained where it comes from, but I don't know when that was used
for the first time.
But why an enraged cow? Why not a dog, or a horse? Because rich people
wouldn't be reduced to buying them to eat meat. They have the means to buy
safe meat (if that exists, I sometimes wonder).
I understand the 'why' - but I wonder if there were enraged or mad cows
(rabies or scrapie) in France for a long time. I have no idea.

Il parait que le boeuf en question a ete vendu a une basse boucherie C'est
peut-etre ce que veut dire l'expression Francaise: "Manger de la vache
enragee." C'est une expression toute faite. On dit ca quand les gens sont
pauvres et ne peuvent pas s'offrir de la bonne viande. On dit aussi"Etre dans
la puree" et "tirer le diable par la queue" et "etre fauche."
Ca vient d'ou et quand cette expression.
Je viens d'expliquer d'ou ca vient, mais je ne sais pas quand ca a ete
utilise pour la premiere fois.
Mais pourqoui une vache enragee? Pourquoi pas un chien, ou un cheval? Parce
que les gens riches ne seraient pas reduits a en acheter pour manger de la
viande. Ils ont les moyens d'acheter de la viande saine. (Si cela existe, je
me le demande parfois.)
Je comprend bien Missouf le pourquoi - mais je me demande s'il y avait des
vaches enragee ou folle (la rage ou tremblante) en France pendand longtemps.
Cela je n'en sais rien.

[As I wrote earlier, caveat lector. I suspect that any further meaningful
discussion of this putative case of spontaneous BSE is unlikely. So, unless
some extraordinarily penetrating comments arrive, I am cutting the thread.
