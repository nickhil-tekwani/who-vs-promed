Hendra virus vet in critical condition
--------------------------------------------
A veterinarian who was exposed to Hendra virus at a central
Queensland horse stud has tested positive to the potentially deadly
illness. The man was admitted to Rockhampton Base Hospital yesterday
after showing symptoms. He was transferred to Brisbane's Princess
Alexandra Hospital overnight in a critical condition.

The vet had treated 2 horses with the virus that died at a property
in Cawarran 7 and 8 Aug [2009]. A total of 3 other people were also
exposed to the virus but Queensland's chief health officer, Jeannette
Young, says there is no reason to suspect the trio have the virus.
"The other 3, at this point, we don't believe have the infection. If
any of them become unwell we've asked them to re-present for
testing," she said.

The owner of the stud, John Brady, said the situation was
"devastating. He's (the vet) been admitted into the Princess
Alexandra [PA] Hospital to be monitored," Mr Brady said. "I'm going
to have a meeting with all of my staff to discuss their symptoms and
whether they too should go to the PA."

Hendra virus is potentially deadly for infected people. A Brisbane
vet died after contracting Hendra from a horse 12 months ago.

[From the ABC Factbox, 11 Aug 2009: "Hendra virus (genus
_Henipavirus_, family _Paramyxoviridae_) affects horses and humans
and is potentially deadly for infected people. It is not fully
understood but there has been extensive research since the disease
was 1st observed in 1994. Hendra virus 1st emerged in Australia in
August and September 1994 when 13 horses died in the Brisbane suburb
of Hendra (hence the name) and 2 horses died in an apparently
unrelated outbreak in Mackay.

The first recorded human death from the virus occurred in Hendra. 2
people became infected after contact with a mare. One of them, a
prominent horse trainer, died as a result. In October 1995 a Mackay
farmer became the [2nd] person to be infected with the virus and he
also died as a result. It was only after his infection and death that
it discovered the initial August 1994 infection of 2 of his horses
and made a retrospective diagnosis.

Since 1994 there have been 12 outbreaks of the disease; 6 people have
become infected and 3 people have died. A 34-year-old vet became the
3rd person to die when he caught the virus from infected horses at a
veterinary clinic in Redlands, on Brisbane's southern outskirts in
August 2008.

The mortality rate for horses is extremely high, with 70 percent of
infected animals dying from the virus. Studies by the Queensland
Department of Primary Industries (DPI) and the Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has found the
virus is commonly spread by fruit bats. They are the natural carriers
of the virus and they are thought to spread the virus through their
urine, faeces or reproductive fluid. Authorities do not believe the
virus is highly contagious in people, but because all 6 cases of
human infection have been in people who have close contact with
infected horses, there are strict quarantine guidelines. In
particular people are cautioned against coming into contact with
blood, saliva and other bodily fluids from infected animals.

There is no evidence of human-to-human spread or human-to-horse
spread of the disease. The onset of the virus can be extremely swift.
Doctors have reported periods of just 24 hours between the 1st sign
of symptoms and the descent into serious illness. The incubation
period in humans is estimated at 5-14 days. The virus commonly
affects the respiratory system and symptoms can resemble influenza.
Pneumonia often results. The virus often affects the brain as well
with encephalitis-type symptoms like headaches, high fever and
drowsiness which can lead to convulsions or coma. There is no vaccine
against the virus but scientists are working to develop one."
