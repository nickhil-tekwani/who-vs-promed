A dead crow found in the area of London's Trafalgar and Hale
roundabout has tested positive for West Nile virus.

"Finding a West Nile [virus] positive crow is a reminder that the
disease is present in our community and that we need to take steps to
protect our families and ourselves from mosquito bites," said Andrew
Powell, public health inspector with the Middlesex-London Health Unit.
"We're calling on the public to let us know when they find dead crows
or blue jays, as happened in this case, so that we can determine
whether mosquitoes in our area are carrying West Nile virus."

Due to the heavy rain in the spring and early summer [2011], the
health unit put larvicides in more than 230 pools of standing water on
public property and a contractor dropped larvicide tablets into
municipal catch basins.

There were no cases of people infected with West Nile [virus] in
London last year (2010), although the virus was found in mosquito
traps and 2 dead birds tested positive.
