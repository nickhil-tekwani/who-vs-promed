E. COLI, FOOD CONTAMINATION - THAILAND (BANGKOK)
================================================
[There has been a flood of articles in the Asian newspapers about E. coli
contamination of packaged food in Bangkok supermarkets with the politicians
and newspapers demanding action yesterday and the harried bureaucrats trying
to get something done. But the facts were obscured by the smoke. So I
contacted Pratap Singhasivanon, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol
University, Bangkok, who has kindly provided the following illumination. MHJ]

From: Pratap Singhasivanon <tmpsh@mahidol.ac.th>
Regarding the packaged fresh food sold in supermarket contaminated with E.
coli in Bangkok, it has been known among the public health professionals for
quite some time. Numerous complaints filed to the Bangkok Metropolitan
Administration (BMA) have prompted an investigation. The survey of packaged
food in many supermarkets (number not revealed) was done last month and
through an unofficial source at least 8-12% of the items of packaged food
surveyed were found to be contaminated with E. coli. (the exact figure is
not known at this moment).
The FDA also regularly collects samples of vegetables for the presence of
insecticide and the percentage seems to be in double figures.
The BMA has asked for a meeting of all the supermarket owners early in April
and better methods of food handling and packaging will be discussed. FAO
will also be extending some assistance in this aspect.
One of the problems cited is the absence of expiry date labels on the
packaged fresh food items. The presently existing law will be enforced
strictly from April. At least 60,000 cases of food poisoning in Thailand
were attributed to consuming bacteria-contaminated food in 1995.

[While the average Thai has accepted a level of contamination in foods
brought in the open markets, they had presumed that this would not be the
case with prepackaged supermarket foods. This contamination is obviously not
a problem with an easy, quick solution. It will be instructive to see how
the Public Health departments go about correcting it. MHJ]
