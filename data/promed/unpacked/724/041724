Horse owners are being warned to take extra hygiene measures to prevent the spread of a mystery disease, a veterinary surgeon has said.

The warning comes after a number of animals fell ill locally with what has been called a 'minor respiratory disease' which appears to be contagious.

Simon Bewsey-Dyke said that until it was known exactly what condition the horses were suffering from, it was best to take the situation seriously.

He said: "All we can say for sure is that a small number of horses on a few yards have been suffering from a minor respiratory disease. We have taken some swabs [from the affected horses] which have been sent off to the UK and we are now waiting for the results."

[The term "mystery disease" is excessively applied in media reports. The test results of the sampled animals are expected.

Viral respiratory infections are common in horses; the most notable are equine herpesvirus infection, equine influenza, and equine viral arteritis. The bacterial disease strangles, caused by _Streptococcus equi equi_, should be included in the differential diagnosis.
