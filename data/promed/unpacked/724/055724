First Report of _Botryosphaeria dothidea_ and _B. obtusa_ on Apple
in Bolivia.
W. J. Kaiser, U.S. Peace Corps Volunteer, Sucre, Bolivia; G. M. Rivero
V. & E. Valverde B., Facultad de Agronom√≠a, Universidad de San
Francisco Xavier, Sucre, Bolivia; & L. Yerkes, U.S. Peace Corps
Volunteer, Sucre, Bolivia. Plant Dis. 86:328, 2002; published on-line as

Gala and Winter Banana apples are important commercial crops in
Azurduy & Lima Bamba, which are located in the Department (state) of
Chuquisaca, Bolivia. White or bot rot (causal agent _Botryosphaeria
dothidea_ (Moug.:Fr.) Ces. De. Not. [anamorph _Fusicoccum aesculi_
Corda]) and black rot (causal agent _B. obtusa_ (Schwein.) Shoemaker
[anamorph _Sphaeropsis malorum_ Berk.]) have not been reported
previously from Bolivia.
Both fungi were isolated from apple fruit and branch cankers in
Azurduy, but only _B. dothidea_ was isolated from rotted fruit and
limb cankers in Lima Bamba. Both fungi also were isolated from rotted
Gala and Winter Banana fruit purchased in the markets in Sucre,
Bolivia.
Symptoms on fruit consisted of light-to-dark brown lesions ...
[ranging] from 3- to 8-cm in diameter. Cankers on limbs were sunken
and reddish brown and ranged from 2 to 25+ cm in length and 0.5 to 3
cm in diameter. Neither pathogen produced pycnidia in lesions on
rotted fruit, but they often developed in branch cankers. Pseudothecia
of _B. dothidea_ and _B. obtusa_ were not observed. Identification of
both pathogens was based on descriptions of their anamorphic stages
(1).
To fulfill Koch's postulates, 4 healthy Gala apple fruit were inoculated
with 2 isolates of each pathogen by wounding the opposite faces of
surface-disinfected fruit with a 5-mm-diameter cork borer and inserting
[plugs of mycelium and PDA]. Wounds were made on the opposite
sides of each fruit, a mycelial plug of one of the pathogens was inserted
in one wound, and ... a plug of sterile PDA was inserted [on the
opposite side] as a control.
Each plug containing fungal mycelium or sterile PDA was covered with
a plug of trimmed apple tissue, and the apple fruit were incubated in a
moist chamber at 17 to 20 degrees C for 10 days.
6 branches on 2 young apple trees growing outdoors in a nursery [were
similarly] ... inoculated ... with 1 isolate of each pathogen: bark was
wounded with a 5-mm-diameter cork borer, and the wounded area was
inoculated with a plug of PDA containing the pathogen or a plug of
sterile PDA for the control. The inoculated sites were wrapped with
masking tape to prevent dehydration.
Within 10 days, all fruit wounds inoculated with isolates of each
pathogen developed brown lesions up to 5 cm in diameter. Each
pathogen was reisolated from tissues in which it had been inoculated,
but not from any of the noninoculated control sites. Within 6 to 8
weeks, all but one wound on branches inoculated with each pathogen
developed depressed canker lesions up to 2 cm in length. Each
pathogen was reisolated from the canker produced by inoculation with
that pathogen, but not from any of the control sites.

[The gist of this piece is that it is the first report of these 2 pathogens in
Bolivia. Black rot caused by _Botryosphaeria obtusa_ can cause major
losses in apple orchards, especially in warm, humid areas. 3 forms of
the disease can occur: fruit rot, leaf spot (frogeye leaf spot) and limb
canker. Infected fruit become unmarketable, severe leaf spotting can
result in defoliation which weakens trees, and limb cankers can girdle
and eventually kill entire branches. Disease management involves
application of fungicides and pruning of infected limbs. The disease
occurs throughout Europe, Australia, India, North America, Zimbabwe,
South Africa and perhaps elsewhere.
