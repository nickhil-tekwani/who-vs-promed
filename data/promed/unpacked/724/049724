In 2005, the Regional Committee of the World Health Organization
(WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR) set a target date of 2012 for
measles elimination in all WPR member states. In Japan, measles
control strategies have included 1) a nationwide public awareness
campaign implemented in 2001 to promote timely vaccination with the
1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) administered on or
after age 12 months, and 2) a 2-dose MCV schedule with the 2nd dose
(MCV2) administered at age 5-6 years, adopted in 2006 in accordance
with the recommended WPR measles elimination strategy. However,
during 2007-2008, Japan experienced a large measles outbreak, which
resulted in exportation of measles cases from Japan into countries
where measles elimination had been achieved. This report describes
the epidemiology of measles in Japan during 1999-2008 and approval of
a National Measles Elimination Plan in December 2007 that includes
recommendations for immunization strategies, case-based measles
surveillance, and monitoring to ensure elimination of measles by
2012. Measles continues to be endemic in Japan, with most cases
occurring in children before school entry, except for 2007 and 2008,
when a shift to an older age group was observed. With implementation
of the National Measles Elimination Plan, Japan is expected to make
progress toward achieving the WPR measles elimination goal.

During 1999-2007, measles surveillance in Japan consisted of
aggregate case reporting from 2 sentinel surveillance systems:
pediatric and adult. In the pediatric sentinel system, cases were
reported from a representative sample of approximately 3000 pediatric
inpatient and outpatient facilities. In the adult sentinel system,
cases were reported from a sample of approximately 450 inpatient
hospitals. In April 2006, the adult definition was changed from age
greater than 18 years to age greater than 15 years; however, some
pediatric sentinel sites continued to report cases in persons aged
greater than 15 years. For both pediatric and adult surveillance
systems, the case definition for measles was the presence of a
generalized rash, fever (101.3 F [38.5 C]), and cough, coryza, or
conjunctivitis; or laboratory-confirmed measles. Laboratory
confirmation of cases was performed by detection of measles-specific
immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, which was usually performed by
commercial laboratories; virus isolation and genotyping were
conducted by public health institutes in the country's prefectures
(i.e., Japanese jurisdictions that are larger than districts and
smaller than regions). During 2000-2007, the total number of
pediatric measles cases was estimated using a multihypergenomic
distribution by multiplying the average number of reported cases per
sentinel medical facility by the total number of similar medical
facilities nationally (1). For adult cases, estimates could not be
calculated because sentinel hospitals were not chosen to be
representative. In January 2008, the 2 sentinel surveillance systems
were replaced with nationwide case-based reporting of measles, and
all health practitioners were required to report any clinical or
laboratory-confirmed case to local health officials. Population
immunity and vaccination coverage for 8 vaccine-preventable diseases
in Japan were measured by the National Epidemiological Surveillance
of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, an annual, national
seroepidemiologic survey conducted among a representative sample of
the Japanese population (2).

Measles outbreaks occurred each year in Japan during 1999-2003 and
involved both children and adults [These data are illustrated by a
Figure in the original text]. The largest outbreak occurred in 2001,
when the number of measles cases among children aged less than 15
years was estimated at 265 000. During 2002-2006, the number of
reported pediatric measles cases decreased to a low of 516 in 2006.

In 2001, national MCV1 coverage was estimated at 83.2 percent in
children aged 24-35 months. In 2002, after a pediatrician-initiated
nationwide public awareness campaign, estimated MCV1 coverage
increased to 96.4 percent among children in the same age group and to
97.9 percent in 2007 [These data are tabulated in detail by age and
year in the original text].

In 2007, a measles epidemic occurred with an estimated 18 000 cases
nationally among children aged less than 15 years. Initially, measles
cases were reported primarily from Tokyo and Saitama prefectures, but
then spread throughout Japan during a 10-day holiday (Golden Week) in
May 2007, affecting all 47 prefectures.

The epidemic continued in 2008 when, using the new nationwide case-
based reporting system, a total of 9631 measles cases were reported
through 22 June 2008. Of these, 6169 (64.1 percent) were clinical
cases and 3462 (35.9 percent) were laboratory confirmed. Cases were
reported from all 47 prefectures but centered in the Tokyo
metropolitan region, where 4229 (43.9 percent) cases were reported,
and in Hokkaido, with 1344 (13.9 percent) cases [illustrated
diagrammatically in the original text]. Persons aged greater than 15
years accounted for 5794 (60.2 percent) cases, with 2584 (26.8
percent) occurring among youths aged 15-19 years. Among 6919 patients
with vaccination status reported, 2540 (36.7 percent) had been
vaccinated previously; of those, 2436 (95.9 percent) had received
MCV1, and 104 (4.1 percent) had received MCV2. In 2008, measles virus
was identified in nasopharyngeal or blood specimens submitted from
141 patients with suspected measles. Genotype results were available
from 104 (73.8 percent) specimens; 96 (92.3 percent) were genotype
D5, 5 (4.8 percent) were genotype H1, and 3 (2.9 percent) were
genotype A (all 3 specimens obtained from recently vaccinated patients) (3).

Nine cases of measles encephalitis were reported in 2007, and 5 cases
were reported during January-June 2008. Ages of persons with measles
encephalitis ranged from 13 to 42 years (median: 23 years); no
encephalitis deaths were reported.

In response to the 2007 outbreak and to achieve the measles
elimination goal agreed on by WPR member states, the Japanese
government approved a 5-year National Measles Elimination Plan in
December 2007. The plan includes a 3-part strategy: 1) intensified
efforts to achieve high vaccination coverage among children and young
adults, including a 5-year catch-up campaign that began in April
2008, targeting cohorts aged 13 years and 18 years with measles and
rubella combined vaccine (MR); 2) establishment of a nationwide
case-based measles-rubella surveillance system; and 3) establishment
of a National Measles Elimination Council and local measles
elimination councils to provide program monitoring and oversight.

In addition to the 5-year catch-up MR campaign, education officials
will review each child's vaccination status at school entry and
during routine physical examinations during the school year,
encouraging vaccination for those who are behind schedule and
following up until children have received 2 doses of MCV. Although
Japanese schools have no vaccination requirements for entry, a
national advocacy and communication campaign also will be conducted
to encourage timely administration of MCV1 at age 12-23 months and
MCV2 at age 5-6 years, before entering primary school.

MMWR Editorial Note
----------------------
The resurgence of measles in Japan in 2007 had wide-ranging effects,
both domestically and internationally. Japanese residents with
measles exported the virus into countries where measles elimination
had been achieved, including the United States and Canada (4,5).
Anecdotal reports also indicate that some visitors to Japan from the
United States and Taiwan were infected with measles virus and
developed measles upon return to their home countries. The
international spread of measles virus from Japan provides a reminder
that countries in regions that have eliminated measles need to
maintain very high levels of vaccination coverage and high-quality
surveillance to limit the spread of imported measles virus.

Virologic surveillance in Japan demonstrated a succession of
genotypes since surveillance activities began there in the early
1990s. Genotypes D3 and D5 cocirculated for most of the 1990s.
Genotype D5 (currently prevalent in Europe) was detected more
frequently in 2001 and genotype H1 during 2002-2005 (and again very
recently in 2008). In 2006, genotype D5 apparently was reintroduced
in Japan and has been re-exported to North America.

Effective implementation of the immunization strategies in Japan's
National Measles Elimination Plan is aimed at reaching high
vaccination coverage ( greater than 95 percent) among persons aged
less than 22 years and also is expected to affect older age groups
through herd immunity. The overall goal is to achieve elimination of
measles by 2012. Monitoring disease incidence, surveillance quality,
and vaccination coverage is critical to ensure progress toward elimination.

Shifting to nationwide case-based surveillance is critical for Japan
to progress toward measles elimination. Use of this system in 2008
enabled more representative reporting of adult cases, allowed for
estimation of age-specific incidence, and provided information on the
vaccination status of persons with reported measles. In addition to
documenting the progress toward measles elimination, the nationwide
surveillance system will monitor the impact of measles elimination
activities on the incidence of rubella and congenital rubella syndrome.

The WHO-recommended strategies for measles elimination include high
routine coverage with 2 doses of MCV, supplementary immunization
activities when routine coverage is not adequate, high-quality case-
based measles surveillance, and access to a high-quality measles
laboratory network. By adopting these recommended strategies, member
states of WPR have made substantial progress in reducing the number
of measles cases and deaths. Moreover, in 2006, South Korea became
the 1st country in WPR to declare measles elimination (9). With
Japan's renewed commitment and political and financial commitments
from all WPR member states and partners, the region is progressing
toward achieving the goal of measles elimination by 2012.

[After a period of decline in the incidence of measles in Japan, an
epidemic recurred in 2007 with an estimated 18 000 cases nationally
among children aged less than 15 years. Initially, measles cases were
reported primarily from the adjacent prefectures of Tokyo and
Saitama, but then spread throughout Japan, ultimately affecting all
47 prefectures. This epidemic has continued into 2008.

As mentioned in the above discussion, the resurgence of measles in
Japan in 2007 had wide-ranging effects, both domestically and
internationally. Genotyping of clinical isolates has revealed that
genotypes D3 and D5 cocirculated for most of the 1990s, with genotype
D5 more frequently detected in 2001 and genotype H1 during 2002-2005
and again very recently in 2008. In 2006, genotype D5 (currently
prevalent in Europe) apparently was reintroduced into Japan and has
been associated with measles cases imported from Japan into North
America. As noted above, The international spread of measles virus
from Japan provides a reminder that countries in regions that have
eliminated measles need to maintain very high levels of vaccination
coverage and high-quality surveillance to limit the spread of
imported measles virus.
