First report of leaf rust on plum (_Prunus cerasifera_) by _Tranzschelia
pruni-spinosa_ var. _discolor_ in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey
S. Soylu <soylu@mku.edu.tr>, E.M. Soylu, and S. Kurt, Department of Plant
Protection, University of Mustafa Kemal, Faculty of Agriculture, 31034
Hatay, Turkey. Accepted for publication 4 Nov 2003.
During the 2003 growing season, plum producers in the eastern Mediterranean
region of Turkey encountered defoliation of plum trees (_Prunus
cerasifera_), as a result of rust infections. Disease was observed in
almost all plum orchards in the region on leaves but not on fruit or twigs.
Early disease symptoms were observed in late May as distinct angular
bright-yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface. As the disease progressed,
light orange-brown pustules (uredinia) bearing urediniospores were observed
in the centre of the lesion on the lower leaf surface. By early September,
leaf lesions turned dark brown as they produced teliospores within rusty
brown pustules.
Microscopic examination of pustules revealed clustered uredinio and
teliospores. Single-celled urediniospores (23-42 x 13-20 micrometers) were
broadly fusiform or clavate with a golden to cinnamon wall and markedly
thickened at the apex (5-7 micrometers).
Two-celled teliospores (25-39 x 18-25 micrometers) were chestnut to
blackish in colour. The apical cell was darker, coarsely verrucose,
globoid, and frequently showed wall thickening at the apex (3-5
micrometers). The basal cell was oblong or ovate, generally tapered towards
the base, smaller and lighter than the apical cell.
The causal agent was identified as _Tranzschelia pruni-spinosa_ (Pers.)
Dietel var. _discolor_ (Fuckel) based on morphological characteristics
(Laundon & Rainbow, 1971) and distinguished from _T. pruni-spinosa_ var.
_pruni-spinosa_ on the basis of teliospore morphology and host range
(domestic rather than wild plum).
Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 1-year-old plum (cv. Canerigi)
nursery stock grown in a greenhouse at 20 C. Plant leaves were inoculated
by atomising an aqueous suspension of urediniospores (100 000 spores per
ml) collected from diseased leaves. After inoculation, the plants were
covered with a plastic bag for 48 h and kept in the growth room at 22 C
with a 16 h photoperiod. Within 5 weeks after inoculation, typical uredinia
and urediniospores developed on inoculated leaves.
This is the first report of plum rust on cultivated plum in the eastern
Mediterranean region of Turkey. Previous reports list _T. pruni-spinosae_
var. _discolor_ on cultivated plums in USA (Bolkan et al., 1985), India
(Sharma & Bhardwaj, 2001) and Israel (Reuveni, 2000).

[_Prunus cerasifera_ (Cherry plum; Myrobalan plum) produces abundant edible
fruits. _Tranzschelia discolor_ (Td), formerly _T. pruni-spinosae_ var.
discolor, causes economic losses in stone fruits (peach, nectarine,
apricot, plum, and wild _Prunus_ spp.) in regions with severe winters.
Losses are potentially severe in orchards where orchards and nurseries are
not sprayed regularly. Td is a cosmopolitan fungus, whereas _T.
pruni-spinosae is found in Europe and USA. In California, the disease is
common on foliage of prune but rarely infects prune fruit. The fungus that
attacks the foliage of prunes, but rarely prune fruit. Rust occurs most
frequently in Sacramento Valley orchards because it is favored by wet
conditions. Severe foliar rust can cause defoliation, which may reduce
yields if defoliation occurs well before harvest. Disease management
depends upon applications of fungicides or sulfur.
