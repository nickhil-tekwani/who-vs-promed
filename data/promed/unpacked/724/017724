Spring algae bloom forces sick sea lions to shore
-------------------------------------------------
Rescuers said Monday [11 Apr 2011] that 7 ailing sea lions rescued
from Santa Monica Bay appeared sicker from seasonal algae-related
poisoning than in past years, The mammals are washing up suffering
grand mal seizures, paralysis, and foaming from the mouth, said Peter
Wallerstein, who supervised the rescues. Wallerstein said they are
suffering from domoic acid poisoning, a neurotoxin produced in large
algae blooms off the coast. "This seems to be a very potent bloom,''
he said.

Domoic acid is a naturally occurring biotoxin found in algae blooms
off California's coast and is caused in part from pollutants, such as
fertilizers and industrial waste that wash out to sea. Ocean
temperatures and changing currents also are believed to play a role,
Wallerstein said.

Marine Animal Rescue has removed 34 sea lions in the last 10 days
from beaches in Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties, he said.

Sickened dolphins and pelicans also are being found, he said. The
group has been able to rehabilitate about half of the stricken
animals, Wallerstein said.

The public should stay away from any mammals that wash ashore because
they are disoriented and may bite, Wallerstein said. The public should
notify a lifeguard or call (800) 39-WHALE to report a sick animal, he
said. "A lot of people want to put their children near these animals
for a photo opportunity,'' Wallerstein said, "but they should just
stay away" from them.

[Domoic acid, an acidic cyanotoxin, a neurotoxic tricarboxylic amino
acid structurally related to kainic and glutamic acids, associated
with certain algal blooms and possibly produced by the diatom
_Pseudonitzschia_ is also called amnesic shellfish poison (ASP).
Domoic acid was named for the seaweed from which it was discovered,
_Chondria armata_, called 'domoi' in Japan. The toxic acid is
accumulated by marine organisms (including sea lions) feeding on
phytoplankton, anchovies, sardines, and shellfish. Domoic acid is
essentially a neurotoxin in mammals causing brain damage, neurological
dysfunction, and death in severe cases.

In 1987, several people died and more than 100 became ill after
eating blue mussels caught off Prince Edward Island, Canada. It was
determined by Canadian scientists that domoic acid had entered the
food chain when the mussels fed on a toxic algae bloom of the pennate
diatom _Pseudonitzschia pungens_ forma _multiseries_.

In 1991, in Monterey Bay, California, a bloom of _Pseudonitzschia
australis_ also produced domoic acid that was then concentrated in
anchovies feeding upon it. The deaths of pelicans and cormorants that
ate the anchovies were reported to be related to their exposure to
domoic acid.

Transient elevations of plasma BUN (blood urea nitrogen) levels, as
well as neurodegeneration of the hippocampus, and memory deficits have
been associated with near-lethal domoic acid exposures.
