15 cases of food poisoning possibly related to fat rich food:
----------------------------------------------------------
Case Definition: Anal incontinence episodes and emission of an oily
substance which leaves stains on the underwear. The events are
self-limited and unlinked to other symptoms.
Since May 2006, 15 cases have been reported in Zaragoza (Spain). The
cases are grouped in small family clusters not related to each other.
No case suffers from malabsorption syndrome or previous drug intake.
Epidemiological investigation suggests relationship with consumption
of a type of fish. The fish species has not been identified yet, but
we have obtained a specimen.
Our hypotheses are:
1. The fish could have been contaminated by an unknown substance
which prevents fat absorption (maybe an unauthorized additive).
2. The fish is a sort of "oil fish" like rudderfish that was linked
to similar outbreaks described in South Australia.
Suggestions and alternative hypotheses will be welcome.

[Outbreaks of malabsorption syndrome similar to that described above
have been reported in Australia associated with ingestion of escolar,
butterfish, oilfish, ruddercod and rudderfish. According to a report
on the Australian Government Department of Health and Aging website,
"In each outbreak, the oily diarrhea was caused by indigestible wax
esters contained within the fish" (for the full report, see the
report by Shadbolt C, Kirk M, Roche P. Editorial: Diarrhoea
associated with consumption of escolar (rudderfish). Commun Dis
Intell Vol 26, No 3, September 2002 available at:
<http://www.health.gov.au/internet/wcms/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-pubs-cdi-2002-cdi2603-htm-cdi2603i.htm
>).
A similar disorder like malabsorption syndrome has been documented
following ingestion of olestra, a substitute for fat used in
producing "fat free" snack foods such as potato chips.
"Information supplied by OzFoodNet epidemiologists [ref 1] and the
South Australian Department of Human Services [ref 2] describe
outbreaks in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. In
November 1999, 2 restaurant outbreaks [ref 3] associated with
butterfish were reported in Victoria, the 1st involving 14 cases.
Victoria's most recent incident involved a further 4 cases at a
restaurant in August 2001 (Gregory, this issue) [ref 4]. The South
Australian Department of Human Services' Public and Environmental
Health Service conducted an investigation into reports of illness
after consumption of rudderfish. 98 cases of illness reports were
received (Givney, this issue) [ref 5]. Similarly, at a conference
luncheon in New South Wales [ref 6] in October 2001, 20 persons
became ill after consuming escolar (Yohannes, this issue) [ref 7].
The latest outbreak occurred in New South Wales (Marianne Tegel, NSW
Health, personal communication, April 2002) when a restaurant served
patrons with what the owner believed was ruddercod. Five people were
adversely affected. The restaurant received complaints, and the owner
informed authorities that an alternate source of seafood would be
used in future. Information supplied from SafeFood NSW (Peter Ayres,
SafeFood NSW, personal communication, March 2002) also indicates that
outbreaks from consumption of escolar have been occurring in the
restaurant and catering setting for a number of years.
Based on the size of the annual escolar catch (up to 400 tons, Hans
Jusseit, East Coast Tuna Boat Owners Association, personal
communication, March 2002), it has been assumed that many, if not the
majority of people eating these fish species do not develop any
illness. However, the attack rates described in these 3 short reports
range from 20/44 (45 percent) to 10/15 (67 percent). There is
probably a significant under-reporting of illness associated with
consumption of these fish, as the symptoms can be mild and
short-lived. In South Australia, 60 additional cases of oily diarrhea
associated with consumption of escolar/rudderfish were identified by
the Department of Human Services following media reports of the issue
(Givney) [ref 5]. There are little data available to identify people
susceptible to oily diarrhea induced by consumption of fish with a
high wax ester content. Yohannes could find no association between
the development of illness and body mass index, age or general health
status. People with bowel problems, malabsorption or pregnancy may be
at increased risk of diarrhea because of eating escolar. It is also
possible that seasonal and geographic differences may influence the
level of indigestible wax ester content in fish.
In those who are susceptible, the onset of symptoms occurs with a
median of 2.5 hours and a range of 1 to 90 hours after consumption
(Yohannes) [ref 7]. The symptoms described in the 3 reports show wide
variation. Symptoms range from mild and rapid passage of oily yellow
or orange droplets, to severe diarrhea with nausea and vomiting. The
milder symptoms have been referred to as "keriorrhoea" (literally
"flow of wax") [ref 8].
Data from the CSIRO Marine Research [ref 9] show that 2 species of
fish, _Lepidocybium flavobrunneum_ (escolar) and _Ruvettus pretiosus_
(oilfish), contain approximately 20 per cent (by weight) of
indigestible wax ester oil. Both species are by-catches from tuna
longlines on the east and west coasts of Australia [ref 10], caught
in quantities of sufficient size that banning them from sale is not
considered an option by the fishing industry.

More information on the type of fish involved in the above described
outbreak in Aragon would be appreciated.
