2 people have died in Finland as investigations into a Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_ [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, EHEC] outbreak continue.

The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) has received 9 reports of suspected _E. coli_ outbreaks from across Finland from June to August 2021. 7 _E. coli_ O103 outbreaks reported to the agency from municipalities in different parts of the country belong to the same incident.

Updating a previous report, the agency said the start date of the epidemic has been set as the end of July 2021. This is defined based on typing of patient isolates. In THL's laboratory from 27 July 2021 to 24 Aug 2021, there were 57 _E. coli_ O103 cases with the Shiga toxin 1 (stx1) gene recorded. Of these, 40 clustered based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) indicating they could be from the same source.

Women are slightly more affected than men. The median age is 37 years old and the range is 2 to 97 years of age.

2 adults were diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and have died. Both were susceptible to infections due to old age or underlying disease. Hemolytic uremic syndrome without a finding of _E. coli_ is not reportable in Finland but mentioning of HUS can be lacking in _E. coli_ notifications. Of the interviewed _E. coli_ O103 patients in 2001 to 2020, none were reported with HUS. The majority of the 33 people interviewed in the current outbreak mentioned symptoms including diarrhea. More than 1/3 of them have been hospitalized. Most had eaten outside the home before becoming ill.

The Finnish Food Authority (Ruokavirasto) and local food control authorities are tracing potential sources of infection based on information provided in the interviews. An outbreak notification has also been sent to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to see if other countries have reported related infections.

Since 2016, an average of 200 _E. coli_ infections have been reported to the Infectious Diseases Register in Finland each year. More than half of these come from abroad. _E. coli_ O103 is one of the more common types of the pathogen found in patients in Finland. It has previously been detected in cattle and raw milk and caused an outbreak in 2014 traced to contaminated water.

[The source of this continued outbreak is not clear. 2 adults developed hemolytic uremic syndrome which tends to develop more in children than adults with EHEC (also called STEC). The following is a good basic review on HUS:

Abstract
"The severity of human infection by one of the many Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (STEC) is determined by a number of factors: the bacterial genome, the capacity of human societies to prevent foodborne epidemics, the medical condition of infected patients (in particular their hydration status, often compromised by severe diarrhea), and by our capacity to devise new therapeutic approaches, most specifically to combat the bacterial virulence factors, as opposed to our current strategies that essentially aim to palliate organ deficiencies. The last major outbreak in 2011 in Germany, which killed more than 50 people in Europe, was evidence that an effective treatment was still lacking. Herein, we review the current knowledge of STEC virulence, how societies organize the prevention of human disease, and how physicians treat (and, hopefully, will treat) its potentially fatal complications. In particular, we focus on STEC-induced hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS), where the intrusion of toxins inside endothelial cells results in massive cell death, activation of the coagulation within capillaries, and eventually organ failure." - Mod.LL
