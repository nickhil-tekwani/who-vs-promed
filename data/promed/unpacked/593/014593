Facial eczema outbreak hitting cows

A Taranaki sharemilker says an outbreak of facial eczema is hitting cows hard and fast.

The farm he works on, has just lost 4 cows to the disease, while over half of the herd have been infected.

He says the warm, damp weather provides the perfect conditions for the disease and he believes it's the worst outbreak of facial eczema he's ever seen.

Taranaki's Federated Farmers president, Harvey Leach, says the weather is fuelling the problem, which starts with short pastures causing cows to graze closer to the ground where the facial eczema spores are.

He says it's hard to tell the extent of the outbreak, but confirms it's an issue for farmers around the country.

[Facial eczema is a type of sunburn (photosensitisation) affecting exposed areas of pale skin of sheep and cattle. It is caused by a poisonous substance called "sporidesmin", which is produced on pasture plants by the fungus _Pithomyces chartarum_. In Victoria, Australia, the disease has occurred mainly in East Gippsland between Rosedale and Bairnsdale. Major outbreaks occurred in sheep in 1956 and 1959, and in cattle on irrigated pasture in 1974. Sporadic cases, mainly in sheep, have been recorded in other parts of Victoria.

The disease in stock may be seen between 7 and 20 days of pick-up of the toxic spores from the pasture. The toxin is absorbed from the intestine and reaches the liver, where it causes severe damage, first to the bile ducts and then to the liver cells themselves. All the outward signs of facial eczema result from the liver damage caused by sporidesmin.

Sheep
-----
The signs range from mild photosensitisation to severe jaundice and death, depending on the amount of sporidesmin consumed. Sunburn is the most consistent sign, and usually affects the exposed areas of the skin of the face, ears, teats, and vulva. The skin over these areas becomes reddened, and then goes crusty and dark. It eventually peels off leaving large raw areas, which are susceptible to infections and flystrike. The sunburn is often accompanied by watery swelling of the underlying tissues, resulting in drooping ears and puffy eyes and face. Jaundice (yellowing of mucous membranes) is often seen at this stage. The animals lose weight rapidly. Most animals recover from the acute phase, but they may take many months to regain condition and wool growth. Some never recover, and either die or are culled.

Cattle
------
The signs are similar to those in sheep, but the sunburn also affects areas of skin lacking dark pigmentation (that is, areas covered by white hair) as well as exposed skin. In dairy cattle, the udder and teats are often severely affected, and milk production drops sharply. Loss of weight and general illness are often severe in cattle, and death, although uncommon, can occur up to months after the initial liver damage occurs.

The warning system is a guide only -- conditions vary between farms and between paddocks. However, an official warning generally means that the fungus is on the rampage, and that spore numbers are likely to be rising on many farms.

The basis of prevention of facial eczema is stock management. When a warning is issued, the following alternatives are available, all of which will help to minimise the intake of toxic pasture:
- Shift stock to the longest pasture possible, and try to avoid very close grazing.
- Avoid paddocks cut for hay or late-topped. These are likely to be more toxic because of greater quantities of pasture litter.
- In general, paddocks sheltered by windbreaks or hills are more dangerous and should be avoided.
- Feed hay or other supplements to preserve ground feed and minimise close grazing of pasture.
- Summer-growing crops are generally safer than pastures, and stock should be given as much access to these as possible where they are available.
- On irrigated farms, if pasture is short and grazing pressure is heavy, farm irrigation may be valuable if used immediately.

In New Zealand, where facial eczema is a regular annual problem, spraying of a fungicide is effective. For optimum effect, the fungicide must be sprayed before the danger period. In Victoria, even in East Gippsland, outbreaks are so uncommon that routine preventive spraying cannot be justified. However, researchers are continuing to, examine the possible use of spraying under Gippsland conditions.

Treatment involves getting the animals out of the sunshine, providing shade and removal from the infected pasture.
