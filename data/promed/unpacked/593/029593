[Since late 2015 south west France has been suffering poultry infections with 3 HPAI strains: H5N1, H5N2 and H5N9.

The updated summary of the HPAI H5N2 event, which reportedly started on 27 Nov 2015, available in OIE's WAHID archive (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019692_20160215_191115.pdf, including a map) is the following:

Total outbreaks = 34 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 136 951 / 7339 / 7339 / 84 547 / 0

It will be interesting to note which considerations are behind the decisions to destroy all susceptible birds in affected premises/locations or to refrain from doing so. - Mod.AS
