From: DeBolt, Chas <Chas.DeBolt@METROKC.GOV>

I am writing to remark about the following language in the 9/13/98
Pertussis USA (Utah) posting [980913101922 cited above:
"Whooping cough in children can be prevented by a series of shots given at
2, 4, 6 and 15 months and again when the child enters school. Because the
vaccinations wear off after five to 10 years, adults and adolescents
immunized as infants can catch whooping cough and pass it along to others."
This is what many health care providers believe, and therefore, they think
immunized children cannot get whooping cough. I sometimes feel like a
snake-oil salesman trying to convince the providers to take the situation
seriously if the kids have had the shots! Even after I have phoned ahead
to let the provider know that a child has had face to face exposure with a
culture-confirmed case in the past 21 days, they may check the immunization
record and simply tell the parent not to worry (because immunizations are
current).
We must be careful about the language we use. Changing the health care
community's understanding of whooping cough in a highly immunized
population is an arduous task for those of us who deal with it daily. I
sometimes find the lay public more open to the current epidemiology of
pertussis than some doctors and nurses. This immunization is not like
measles vaccine, where 95% of those receiving the vaccine develop measles
IgG and are then immune to measles.
As an example, prophylactic antibiotics for an asymptomatic immunized child
with a known exposure can be important. Pertussis in an immunized child
can present as a few days of cold symptoms with a slight night cough. But
they may still be contagious. The immunized child could expose an infant
too young for immunization. And that infant could die from pertussis
disease.
