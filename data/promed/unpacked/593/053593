CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Bareilly infections. _S._ Bareilly is an unusual serotype. Public health investigators used DNA "fingerprints" of bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They used data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 93 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Bareilly have been reported from 19 states and the District of Columbia. The number of ill people identified in each state with the outbreak strain is as follows: Alabama (2), Arkansas (1), Connecticut (4), District of Columbia (2), Georgia (4), Illinois (8), Louisiana (2), Maryland (8), Massachusetts (4), Mississippi (1), Missouri (1), New Jersey (6), New York (23), North Carolina (2), Pennsylvania (2), Rhode Island (4), South Carolina (3), Texas (3), Virginia (5), and Wisconsin (8).

Among 93 persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 28 Jan 2012 to 23 Mar 2012. Ill persons range in age from 4 to 78 years, with a median age of 31. 46 percent of patients are female. Among 51 persons with available information, 10 (20 percent) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses that occurred after 4 Mar 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks.

Investigation of the outbreak
------------------------------
State public health officials are interviewing ill persons to obtain information regarding foods they might have eaten and other exposures in the week prior to illness. On initial interviews, many of the ill persons reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in a variety of locations in the week before becoming ill. Among 51 ill persons for whom information is available, 35 (69 percent) reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or similar foods in the week before illness onset. This percentage is higher than expected compared with results from a survey of healthy persons in which 5 percent of persons reported consuming sushi, sashimi, or ceviche made with raw fish or shellfish in the 7 days before they were interviewed. The investigation into specific types of sushi is ongoing.

The investigation has not conclusively identified a food source. Investigation is ongoing into individual food items and their sources. CDC, FDA, and state and local public health partners are continuing surveillance to identify and interview other ill persons about the foods they ate. CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.

[As noted in yesterday's initial posting (archive no 20120404.1090246), outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are most likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught. A central location with continued contamination of the outbreak strain would be needed for the outbreak to continue over 2+ months since the storability of the fish is quite limited. It is more likely that, if the sushi continues to be implicated, another ingredient in the sushi such as a spice, a vegetable, or seaweed wrapping would be the vehicle.

The accidental release of this outbreak information from the FDA precipitated this early report from CDC. Several newspaper reports specifically mentioned "spicy tuna rolls" as a vehicle but ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding this ongoing outbreak. - Mod.LL]
