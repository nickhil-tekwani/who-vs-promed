Re: anthrax heroin cases in Scotland
------------------------------------
Yesterday [1 Feb 2010] Health Protection Scotland (HPS) posted a new case; see
<http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/anthrax/index.aspx>.

This announces a new case in Tayside but without further details.

Dr Colin Ramsay, consultant epidemiologist, has kindly made available
a digital distribution map of the 18 cases as of Fri 29 Jan 2010, for
which we are very grateful. See
<https://filestogeaux.lsu.edu/public/download.php?FILE=mhughj1/48353PIEY6b>.

Using the following roadmap of Scotland you can connect the dots from
Glasgow to Kilmarnock in the south, and to Dundee in the northeast, or
for a minimum of 2 delivery routes:
<http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Img/47021/0031737.gif>.

Taking into account that there are some 50 000 heroin addicts in
Scotland and the majority are in the Glasgow <-> Edinburgh corridor,
Scotland clearly got off very lightly. The spatial distribution and
paucity of cases suggests a chunky contamination unevenly distributed
in the product, that is, the affected were not just getting a
collection of individual spores, occasionally acquiring too many, but
more likely there were small chunks of stuff with spores imbedded in
them, rather like the lanolin chunks with spores that you find in
contaminated wool. Most didn't get them but sometimes someone did, and
when they do there are a lot of spores.

The Scottish authorities have yet to identify any spore-positive
heroin samples. However they have had cases who had shared their
heroin with others but only the individual case was affected. The
apparently unaffected are being followed up.
