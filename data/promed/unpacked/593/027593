BOID INCLUSION BODY DISEASE: RFI
================================
I am seeking journal references to Boid Inclusion Body Disease
associating it with the common name "Stargazing Disease". Any
other information on this disease would also be appreciated.
Also interested in finding out if anyone can provide pointers
to references which formally link the term "stargazing" as
a symptom or syndrome due to any other disorder other than
viral boid inclusion body disease. It does not seem to come
up on the normal computer searches of the reviewed literature.
Thank you.

- According to the popular herpetological press and the Bulletin of
Reptile & Amphibian Veterinarians this disease is caused by a
paramyxovirus, a herpes virus, and maybe others. It was first noted
in imported African pythons in zoological garden collections some
ten years ago. It features inclusion bodies and CNS symptoms, thus
"stargazing".- Martin Hugh-Jones, ProMED-AHEAD moderator.
