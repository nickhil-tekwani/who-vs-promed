Friends say a 15-month-old [boy], whose legs were both amputated Friday [14 Aug 2015] after he contracted a rare bacterium, has always been a happy, active kid, always moving around.

[The boy] was diagnosed with _Haemophilus influenzae_ [HI] type B [infection]. The rare bacterium sent him into septic shock. Late last week, doctors at SickKids [Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada] amputated both his legs from the knees down. This coming Friday, in [the boys's] 3rd surgery in 2 weeks, doctors will also remove his right arm.

There are several types of HI bacteria, causing symptoms from mild to severe, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. [The boy's] type B is the most serious [strain]; babies and children under 5 [years of age] are especially at risk of contracting the germ. There is a vaccine for it, which protects 95 per cent of children against serious infections, according to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. [The boy was said to have been] vaccinated.

But on 24 Jul 2015, a day after [the boy] had a slight cough and fever, [the boy's] family doctor sent them to the emergency room after a worrisome chest X-ray. [The boy's] lips began turning blue at North York General Hospital; he was immediately transferred to SickKids. Soon afterward, [the parents] received the devastating news. [A family friend] said, "They sat them down, and they said, 'This is life or death. Your son might not make it. You can go in and see him, but you won't recognize him.' I went in to see him, and I wasn't prepared for what I saw. His body was black, except for his torso, his face and where his diaper was. It looked like charcoal."

That [the boy's] legs had to be amputated only from the knees down was a sliver of good news for the family Friday afternoon. His brain and heart are also free of the bacterium. But it's not much relief for the family. [The mother] told the Star Monday that [the boy] had endured a hard day, and the worst was still to come. "May he continue staying strong so we could bring him home in the near future," she almost prayed.

[The family friends] are trying to help, too. They started a GoFundMe page last week to help pay for costs related to [the boy's] condition and changes the family will have to make to their lives once he is out of the hospital. Taking care of [the boy] will become a full-time job for [his mother], who works in administration. The account has raised more than USD 35 000; Rachel's friends are aiming for at least USD 50 000.

[_Haemophilus influenzae_ is a small gram-negative coccobacillus with several antigenically distinct capsular polysaccharide subtypes (a-f). There are also unencapsulated, nontypable strains. _H. influenzae_ colonizes the nasopharynx and spreads from person to person by respiratory droplets. _H. influenzae_ type b (Hib) strains are the most pathogenic due to their propensity to cause invasive disease, especially meningitis and bacteremia, although other encapsulated strains also can cause invasive disease. Hib virulence factors include a unique polysaccharide capsule (polyribosylribitol phosphate or PRP), as well as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the biological activity of which, although chemically different from the LPS of the Enterobacteriaceae, appears to be similar to that of other gram-negative LPS.

The prevalence of Hib invasive disease (e.g., meningitis, bacteremia, metastatic foci of infection), peaks in infants aged 6 months - 3 years, which corresponds to the period when blood has been found to lack bactericidal antibody against Hib, whereas the blood of neonates (with transplacentally acquired antibody), older children, and adults is bactericidal for Hib. This activity is due to antibody against the type b capsular polysaccharide.

Hib infections have declined dramatically in the U.S. after Hib capsular polysaccharide conjugated to protein antigens vaccines became available. Prior to the widespread and routine immunization of children against type b organisms, Hib was the most common cause of pediatric bacterial meningitis in the United States. In the pre-Hib vaccine era, approximately 20 000 instances of invasive Hib disease occurred annually. Since use of Hib conjugate vaccines began, the number of cases of invasive Hib disease has decreased by more than 99 percent (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/hib.html).

This decline has been attributed to the conjugate vaccine's effect on preventing nasopharyngeal carriage of Hib, which decreases spread of Hib in the community and thus creates a barrier around unimmunized children because of the effect of herd immunity.

There are several different Hib conjugate vaccines that are given in 3 or 4 doses, depending on which Hib vaccine is used. The 1st dose is given at 2 months of age; the 2nd dose at 4 months; 3rd dose at 6 months (if needed, depending on brand of vaccine), and the
final/booster dose at 12-15 months of age. The Hib conjugate vaccines are so effective in preventing Hib infection that the finding of invasive disease in a fully immunized child should suggest the possibility of an underlying immunodeficiency and prompt further diagnostic evaluation. (see ProMED-mail post Haemophilus influenzae, type b, fatal - USA: (MN) 20090124.0319.) More information on the case presented in the news report above in this regard from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

A rapidly progressive and frequently fatal syndrome, called purpura fulminans (PF), characterized by shock, necrotic skin lesions and gangrene of the extremities that frequently requires amputation of the affected extremities is caused by thrombosis in small blood vessels and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). PF can be seen with a variety of microorganisms, such as meningococcus and pneumococcus; but Hib has occasionally been reported to cause PF (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16566545 and http://www.jintensivecare.com/content/2/1/13).

A fulminant systemic infection, Brazilian purpuric fever, with high mortality characterized by hemorrhagic skin lesions, shock, and peripheral necrosis, has been recognized in children, but is caused by _H. influenzae_ biogroup _aegyptius_. - Mod.ML
