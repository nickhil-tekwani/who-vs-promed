Global flu activity rose in the 1st half of November 2022, mainly due to rising levels in North America, parts of Europe, and a few locations in other regions, the World Health Organization said this week in a regular update [https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/influenza-updates/2022/2022_11_28_surveillance_update_433.pdf].

The United States and Canada are experiencing earlier-than-expected flu surges at levels higher than in prepandemic years. Europe's activity is also rising, with many countries above their epidemic thresholds and Germany and Portugal reporting widespread activity.

Elsewhere, flu detections rose in parts of the Middle East, especially in Iran. And in temperate South America, flu activity remained elevated in Argentina and Chile.

Testing respiratory specimens at global flu labs reveals that influenza A made up 95.2% of samples during the 1st half of November 2022. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 83.7% were H3N2. Of the characterized influenza B viruses, all belonged to the Victoria lineage.

More than 6 million Americans have been infected with flu and nearly 3000 have died from the disease so far since October [2022] -- in the worst outbreak in a decade.

Latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also show there have been 53 000 hospitalizations in that time.

A total of 18 states reported 'very high' flu levels in the week ending 19 Nov 2022, 4 more than in the previous 7-day spell. New Mexico, Texas, and Tennessee are the worst affected.

America's flu season began early this year [2022], with seasonal viruses returning with a vengeance after lockdowns, face masks, and other measures prevented exposure to healthy germs.

The wave of sickness has also sparked shortages of key drugs, including the children's frontline medication amoxicillin -- commonly used to treat bacterial infections.

The CDC publishes weekly flu estimates on the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths sparked by the disease throughout the season.

The latest infection numbers are 36 per cent above the 4.4 million cases estimated over the previous week, and more than double the 2.8million from a fortnight ago.

Deaths have also surged from 1300 recorded a fortnight beforehand.

The hospitalization rate was 11.3 admissions per 100 000 people in the week to 19 Nov 2022, higher than at any other point at this time of year since 2010-2011.

Flu cases are now 66 per cent of the total number of infections recorded throughout the whole of last year [2021] when there were 9 million cases. The flu season typically runs from October to May.

COVID has accounted for 2.2 million confirmed cases since October [2022], but the actual number is likely far higher -- with many cases missed due to lack of testing. The pandemic virus was also behind 14 000 deaths.

In 2009, America was hit by an [influenza A/H1N1] epidemic, which triggered 60 million cases, 274 000 hospitalizations, and 12 500 fatalities.

Flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and other seasonal menaces have been absent since 2020 after restrictions to control COVID stopped them from spreading.

This year [2022], COVID is still circulating but has remained at about 300 000 cases a week since early October.

But this year [respiratory infections] have returned with a vengeance, spreading rapidly -- and infecting many children for the 1st time.

Experts say flu cases are higher this year because influenza was sidelined for most of the pandemic.

The youngest children have also not built up a defense against the virus owing to a lack of exposure to good germs.

Warnings of a bad flu season were made months ago after Australia and New Zealand -- which are normally precursors for outbreaks in the US -- both faced record-breaking seasons.

Canberra had recorded 65 000 cases by May this year [2022], more than double the 30 000 from 2019 in the year before the pandemic began.

Children's hospitals in the country also faced surging admissions -- in a warning to the US -- forcing some to divert resources away from other care.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is already reporting shortages of amoxicillin, a key child antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections such as pneumonia, respiratory infections, and strep throat -- all of which become more common after a flu infection.

Local pharmacies have also said they are running out of Tamiflu, Augmentin -- which contains amoxicillin -- and Tylenol. There is also a shortage of the inhaler Albuterol.

The Biden administration did, however, spend more than USD 5 billion bringing in bivalent COVID vaccines. The bivalent booster jab against COVID is also being offered to everyone older than 5 years, but fewer than 12 per cent of those who are eligible have come forward for the COVID shot.

The CDC recommends that all people over 6 months old get their annual flu vaccine. Flu vaccine uptake is also lagging with 150 million doses having been dished out to date -- 13 million lower than at the same time last year [2021].

To boost uptake the Biden administration has launched a more than USD 475 million drive that will last for 6 weeks.

Where did the flu go the past 2 years...
The flu's spread was massively curbed over the 1st 2 years of the COVID pandemic.

Viral interference from COVID -- which stopped other viruses spreading -- combined with mitigation measures like masking and restrictions on indoor events led to little spread of the virus.

As a result, immunity waned in many individuals because a lack of infections meant it was not re-booted.

And the youngest children never built up immunity to seasonal menaces because they were not exposed to good germs.

This led many experts to warn seasonal viruses could return with a vengeance this year [2022]. There were early warning signs in Australia and New Zealand -- a 'bell wether' for outbreaks in the US -- who both faced record-breaking flu seasons. There pediatric hospitals also faced a surge of admissions, like the US at present.

Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, issued a warning about the rampant spread of the flu in the Southern Hemisphere. Some 14 states -- mostly in the south -- are already facing very high levels of flu despite it still being early in the season.

[The statement that "lack of exposure to good germs resulted in lower immunity against the flu," can be misleading. The relatively lower rates of human influenza reported over the last 2 years/seasons can be attributed to a number of factors: massive use of precautionary measures, including hand hygiene, social distancing, and use of masks, not to mention lockdowns that prohibited crowding and social gatherings, helped to control COVID-19 surges and also effectively prevented the spread of influenza and other respiratory diseases. Also, influenza testing was affected during the pandemic, as COVID-19 confirmations took precedence. As laboratory testing for COVID-19 is now largely recommended to include influenza and other respiratory pathogens and vice versa, detection rates are likely to go up.

Monitoring influenza activity and promoting influenza vaccination, especially among the high risk populations, as well as advocating for use of non-pharmaceutical measures that worked during COVID-19 can be helpful. - Mod.UBA]
