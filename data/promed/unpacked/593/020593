There's a largemouth bass (_Micropterus salmoides _) virus at
Tunica Cutoff, a man-made lake, and Mississippi state officials
worry it could spread to other lakes. The Department of Wildlife,
Fisheries and Parks says the virus was first discovered 4 years
ago in South Carolina and only affects largemouth bass. The virus
is spread by transferring water from one place to another and by
open wounds on the fish. The same virus was discovered last year
at Sardis Lake. It is not harmful to humans.
