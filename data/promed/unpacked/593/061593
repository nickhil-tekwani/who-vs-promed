Bird Disease Outbreak Over in Gonzales, Texas area
--------------------------------------------------
Animal health officials have announced that an outbreak of the H5N2 strain
of highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) near Gonzales, Texas, has been
eradicated, after tests on more than 352 noncommercial flocks did not
detect additional infection. For more than 5 weeks, a task force composed
of veterinarians and animal health inspectors from the Texas Animal Health
Commission (TAHC) and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Veterinary
Services (USDA-VS) combed the area around Gonzales to locate and test
noncommercial flocks to ensure the contagious poultry virus had not spread
from a single infected flock that was detected and depopulated in Feb 2004.
Disease surveillance samples submitted by commercial poultry operators in
the area also have tested negative for the virus.
"The disease outbreak near Gonzales began in mid-Feb 2004, when a
different, more potentially pathogenic strain of AI was detected in at
least 10 Asian countries. About that time, mild strains of the virus were
detected in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York. Additionally, a highly
pathogenic strain of AI was detected in Canada. AI outbreaks were in the
world's spotlight," said Dr. Max Coats, deputy director for Animal Health
Programs for the Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's
livestock and poultry health regulatory agency.
Dr. Coats said the H5N2 AI strain in Texas, and the milder AI strains
detected in the northeast states, have not been shown to affect human
health or to compromise food safety. However, when initial amino acid
sequencing tests met the international animal health standard for an AI
strain to be classified as highly pathogenic to infected poultry, a number
of countries shut the door on shipments of poultry and poultry products
from Texas, or, in some cases, the entire country.
"The 1st priority for the AI task force in Texas was to stop the outbreak,
eliminate infected flocks, determine whether the disease had spread to
other flocks, and ultimately, to conduct sufficient surveillance to confirm
that the disease was eradicated. These steps are necessary for Texas to
regain its access to foreign markets," he said. "We received outstanding
support from the city of Gonzales, where we set up an incident command
center for the 50-member joint state and federal task force. Thanks to the
cooperation of the poultry industry, flock owners, and the Texas Veterinary
Medical Diagnostic Laboratory (TVMDL), we were able to complete the testing
and demonstrate that the disease outbreak has been wiped out."
"On 21 Feb, we depopulated the infected flock of about 6600 broiler
chickens near Gonzales, and within a few days, the premise had been
thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, to kill all traces of the virus. In
Houston, 2 bird markets that sell live fowl for on-site slaughter, had
received birds from the infected farm. These poultry markets, and 3 others
in Houston, were depopulated and also cleaned and disinfected to ensure
that disease would not spread," said Dr. Coats.
"Since late Feb 2004, the TAHC and USDA task force team has tested and
retested noncommercial flocks as many as 4 times within a 10-mile radius
around the premise where the infected chickens were housed. Within a radius
of 10-30 miles from the infected premise, noncommercial flocks located near
commercial poultry operations were sampled, and all had negative test
results," said Dr. Coats. "In addition, the testing was expanded and
accelerated in commercial flocks to provide assurance that commercial
flocks are not infected."
"As an extra biosecurity precaution, the AI task force members did not
enter commercial poultry operations. Poultry company veterinarians
submitted the necessary blood and swab samples, which were tested at the
Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratories in Gonzales and College
Station, and, in a few cases, at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa."
Dr. Coats said task force members followed strict biosecurity protocols to
prevent spreading viruses or bacteria. "Every precaution was taken to
avoid the potential of transmitting any disease from one farm to another.
The testing crews wore disposable coveralls, head and boot coverings and
latex gloves," he said. "They cleaned and disinfected their truck tires
and equipment before entering or exiting a premise, and bagged their
'dirty' disposable clothing, head coverings, and gloves before leaving a farm."
"Laboratory test results, epidemiological reports, and good veterinary
science provide assurance that this Texas AI infection has been wiped out.
We still are working to determine how the infection may have been
introduced into the flock, and routine disease surveillance will be
continued in commercial poultry flocks," said Dr. Coats. "Now we must work
to have our international trade status reinstated with nearly 40
countries. In late Mar 2004, the AI task force in Gonzales hosted a
scientific delegation from Mexico that evaluated our efforts. USDA trade
negotiators will continue to encourage other countries to reopen their
borders as soon as possible, to enable international poultry trade to resume."
"We were very fortunate that this outbreak involved only one farm," said
Dr. Coats. "The flock owner acted quickly when he noticed higher than
normal death losses. I urge anyone with poultry or livestock also to act
quickly if they see unusual signs of illness or death losses. Call the
TAHC, or your private veterinary practitioner, so samples can be collected,
and action can be taken to stop a disease outbreak." A TAHC veterinarian
is on call 24 hours a day at 1-800-550-8242 to take reports of potential
disease outbreaks.
