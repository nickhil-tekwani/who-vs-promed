The New Mexico Department of Health announced today, 10 Sep 2013, a probable case of plague in an 11-year-old girl from Torrance County.

Preliminary test results at the Department's Scientific Laboratory Division were positive. Confirmatory testing is pending. This is the 2nd human case of plague in New Mexico and in the USA in 2013. An environmental investigation will take place at the girl's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.

"Everyone needs to avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits and their nests and burrows," said Department of Health Secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "Families should also talk to their veterinarian about an appropriate flea product for their pets."

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife and pets. "Unfortunately, it is not possible to eradicate plague from the rodent population or to totally eliminate risk to residents who live in areas where there is plague," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. "Education about how plague is transmitted to people and what steps can be taken to reduce your risk are key in preventing future cases of this potentially deadly disease."

To prevent plague, the Department of Health also recommends:
- Keep your pets from roaming and hunting.
- Clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles.
- Sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian.
- See your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases, there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit or neck areas. Plague symptoms in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy and loss of appetite. There may be a swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report to the New Mexico Department of Health.

The 1st human plague case in New Mexico this year [2013] was reported in August 2013 in a 15-year-old boy from Torrance County. There was one human plague case in New Mexico in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, one of them fatal.

This case of bubonic plague (left femoral lymphadenopathy) had antibiotics prior to any cultures being done, so there was no growth on culture. The case had a significant titer on acute serology (1:128) and along with clinical findings meets the "probable" national case definition. A follow up convalescent serology will be done and if there is a 4-fold increase in titer, this will confirm the case.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Ettestad for the report and his comment.

Both USA cases in 2013 have occurred in the same New Mexico county. A county map of the state of New Mexico (http://nmhealth.org/ERD/HealthData/documents/HumanPlagueinNMbyCounty1949-2012.pdf) shows that the concentration of human plague cases in New Mexico (1949-2012) is in the northwestern part of the state. Most USA cases of human plague infection occur in the Four Corner states -- the southwestern states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado -- although California and Oregon have reported cases in recent years. - Mod.LL
