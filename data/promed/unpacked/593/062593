Consumers are being warned about the potential health risks when barbecuing chicken after a spike in cases of foodborne illness linked to poultry. More than 1000 people have become ill with vomiting and diarrhea in 5 weeks, up 27 per cent on the average figure for the same period over the past 3 years.

Experts are reminding barbecue lovers about the importance of handling and cooking chicken properly following the surge in illness caused by _Campylobacter_. NHS [National Health Service] Scotland laboratories have confirmed a total of 1073 infections with the bacterium, but, as not all patients will have contacted the health service for advice, the actual number of people who have developed symptoms is likely to be higher.

Campylobacteriosis is frequently caused by contact with raw poultry and leads to stomach pain, sickness and diarrhea. While most people recover quickly, the symptoms can last for up to 11 days. In the worst cases people can die from complications, with young children and the elderly most at risk.

Dr Alison Smith-Palmer, epidemiologist for Health Protection Scotland, which monitors diseases, said: "One of the ways people get it is through mishandled poultry, such as washing it under the kitchen tap or handling raw poultry and then bread products or salad. "Another way is by not cooking poultry properly on the barbecue."

It is typical for cases of campylobacteriosis to increase in the summer months in Scotland. This is linked to the popularity of barbecues in the warmer weather and people picking up the food poisoning when they dine during foreign holidays.

Dr Smith-Palmer said: "We know some of our cases are acquired abroad in people going over and bringing it back from holiday."

However, there is no certainty about the cause of the surge in cases seen in Scotland since mid-June 2014. The infection is not passed easily from person to person and the latest spate of cases seems to be spread across the country and across age groups.

Dr Smith-Palmer said: "Why it has gone up more in 2014 than previous years -- there are probably multiple reasons. One could be warmer weather and barbecuing and people being out in the environment."

The spike in numbers is not unprecedented. The average number of cases for the same 5 weeks covering June and early July between 2011 and 2013 was 840. However, in 2010 the total was slightly higher than 2014.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched a campaign about _Campylobacter_ in June 2014, saying it was the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. It is, however, much less well known than _E. coli_ or _Salmonella_. The body's research found only 28 per cent of people knew about it.

According to the FSA, about 4 out of 5 cases of campylobacteriosis are caused by contact with raw poultry. It is promoting the message not to wash raw chicken, as splashed water droplets can spread bacteria across hands, clothing, work surfaces and cooking equipment.

Previous estimates suggest that campylobacteriosis causes more than 100 deaths in the UK every year and costs the economy about 900 million pounds. The FSA is also working with farmers and producers to reduce rates of _Campylobacter_ in the national flock.

[Whether with enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ in ground beef or _Salmonella_ or _Campylobacter_ in poultry, one should treat all uncooked meat as potentially contaminated. To prevent illness, the meat should be adequately cooked and proper kitchen hygiene should be practiced, including not putting the cooked meat (or any other ingredients) back where the uncooked meat was placed. Recently the common practice of washing the uncooked poultry in a sink prior to cooking has been discouraged since it may aerosolize bacteria to other food and/or surfaces. - Mod.LL
