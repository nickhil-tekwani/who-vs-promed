More than 3000 mule, or sterile, ducks have been culled due to an H5N5 subtype infection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which is the 1st reported case in Taiwan.

Tu Wen-chen, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, said 3583 ducks from a farm in the Qishan district of Kaohsiung City were confirmed as having the H5N5 virus on 13 Sep 2019 and killed by the authorities. The bureau later also inspected 5 other duck farms within a 3 km [about 1.9 mi] distance.

[The sampled] ducks did not show any symptoms of infection when they were taken for examination. The bureau visited 30 duck farms in 6 cities and counties in southern Taiwan from 23 Aug to 12 Sept 2019 to test if any poultry had contracted seasonal diseases.

According to Chiou Chwei-jang, director-general of the Animal Health Research Institute, the H5N5 virus could have been transmitted through infected wild birds from Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world. China reported H5N5 infections in 2008, and there have been a handful of H5N5 cases found in wild birds or poultry farms in Europe over the past 2 years, he added [details in commentary].

The H5N5 virus does not affect human beings but is highly pathogenic and fatal to poultry. Tu Wen-chen said the bureau will continue carrying out inspections at poultry farms across Taiwan and conduct sample tests in avian flu-affected areas.

The bureau urged poultry farmers to conduct rigorous disinfection and cleaning operations at their farms.

[Taiwan maintains an intensive avian influenza surveillance within its poultry population, accompanied by meticulous reporting to the OIE. This includes immediate notifications when new strains are discovered and follow-up reports of such events that continue until the event is declared resolved.

During 2019, the following strains have been reportedly circulating in Taiwan:
1. HPAI H5N2: a continuing event that had started in January 2015, so far causing 933 outbreaks; summary with links to all follow-up reports and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=16936;
2. LPAI H7N7 (breeding ducks, subclinical); see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=30402; and
3. LPAI H5N2 (layer hens, clinical); see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=30964.

HPAI H5N5 has never before been reported from Taiwan. This event has not yet been reported to the OIE.

HPAI H5N5 has been identified, in recent years, in several European countries in wild birds and poultry.

During the period January 2013 - August 2018, the following avian influenza subtypes have been reported to the OIE, globally:

Africa: H5N1, H5N2, H5N8
Americas: H5N1, H5N2, H5N8, H7N3, H7N8, H7N9
Asia: H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N6, H5N8, H7N9
Europe: H5N1, H5N2, H5N5, H5N6, H5N8, H5N9, H7N7
Oceania: H7N2
