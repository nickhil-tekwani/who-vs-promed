[In June 2018, Malawi reported an event of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) serotype 2; 11 outbreaks were reported, affecting the districts of Neno, Ntcheu, Dedza, and Lilongwe. The event was communicated as resolved on 5 Jan 2019. See event summary and updated map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=26762.

FMD is endemic in Malawi. The following information is available from the WRLFMD-Pirbright Institute website at https://www.wrlfmd.org/southern-africa/malawi:

FMDV serotype / Years
Untyped / 2015
O / 1957, 1962, 1974-1975, 1982, 1985, 1998
A / 1966-1967, 1973, 1974 (carrier cattle), 1981
SAT 1 / 1970-1971, 2000-2001, 2015-2016
SAT 2 / 1959, 1973, 1975, 2003-2004, 2008, 2011, 2019
SAT 3 / 1976

Note: All 3 SAT serotypes are probably endemic in the African buffalo (_Syncerus caffer_) population.

Unfortunately, for this current report there is no information on the serotype involved or details about the vaccine used. - Mod.CRD
