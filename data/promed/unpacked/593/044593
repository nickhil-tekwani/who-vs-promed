2001/050 First report of Alternaria brown spot of citrus in Spain [edited
---------------------------------------------
In 1998, a new disease of Fortune mandarin trees (_Citrus reticulata_) was
observed in the Province of Valencia, Spain. Symptoms were typical of those
caused by Alternaria brown spot of citrus (EPPO Alert List). Young leaves
showed brown necrotic and irregular blighted areas with characteristic
yellow halos. On fruits, symptoms included light brown, slightly depressed
spots to circular and dark brown areas on the external surface. Necrotic
lesions on leaves had a tendency to follow the veins. Infected young fruits
and leaves often fell and mature fruits were unmarketable because of the
lesions, resulting in [significant economic losses. Fortune mandarin is
one of the most important late-maturing cultivars grown in Spain. The
[fungal pathogen was isolated and identified as _Alternaria alternatata_
on the basis of conidial morphology. Koch's postulates were fulfilled. In
1999, the disease was also found in other citrus-growing areas on Fortune
and Nova mandarins, and on Minneola tangelos. The situation of Alternaria
brown spot in Spain can be described as follows: Present: found in several
citrus-growing areas.
