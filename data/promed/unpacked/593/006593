Today [18 Nov 2020] marks the end of the 11th Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), nearly 6 months after the 1st cases were reported in Equateur Province. The outbreak took place in communities scattered across dense rain forests as well as crowded urban areas, creating logistical challenges. These were surmounted due to the leadership of the government and local communities, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners.

WHO congratulates responders and all those who tirelessly tracked cases, provided treatment, engaged communities and vaccinated more than 40 000 people at high risk and thanks a wide range of partners for their support. Vaccinators used an innovative cold chain storage to keep the Ebola vaccine at temperatures as low as -80 deg C. The ARKTEK freezers can keep vaccines at very low temperatures in the field for up to a week and enabled responders to vaccinate people in communities without electricity.

"Overcoming one of the world's most dangerous pathogens in remote and hard-to-access communities demonstrates what is possible when science and solidarity come together," said Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. "The technology used to keep the Ebola vaccine at super-cold temperatures will be helpful when bringing a COVID-19 vaccine to Africa. Tackling Ebola in parallel with COVID-19 hasn't been easy, but much of the expertise we've built in one disease is transferrable to another and underlines the importance of investing in emergency preparedness and building local capacity."

The outbreak in western DRC, announced on 1 Jun 2020, came as another Ebola outbreak in the eastern part of the country was winding down, and finally declared over on 25 Jun 2020. The 2 outbreaks were geographically far apart. Genetic sequencing analysis found that they were unrelated. By the end of the current 11th Ebola outbreak in Equateur Province, there were 119 confirmed cases, 11 probable, 55 deaths and 75 people who had recovered.

Equateur Province was also the site of the country's 9th Ebola outbreak, which was overcome in a little over 3 months in 2018 and had half as many cases reported. However, the response to the 11th Ebola outbreak had to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic, which strained resources and created difficulties around the movement of experts and supplies. There were also challenges around the large number of cases in remote communities that were often only accessible by boat or helicopter, and at times community resistance hampered response efforts.

Under the leadership of the DRC government, most responders were mobilized locally, and they moved quickly, despite important logistical and access difficulties. Vaccination efforts began just 4 days after the outbreak was declared. Around 90% of the vaccinators were from local communities. The response also tapped into the expertise of local health workers trained during the 2 recent outbreaks in the DRC. Responders worked closely with community members to increase understanding of the virus by visiting more than 574 000 households and providing more than 3 million people with pertinent health and safety information.

At the height of the outbreak there were more than 100 WHO experts on the ground, supporting the government's response. While the 11th outbreak is over, there is a need for continued vigilance and maintaining strong surveillance, as potential flare-ups are possible in the months to come. In this regard, WHO and other partners are currently conducting important actions for improving critical operational capacities in Equateur Province, including training frontline workers.

The end of this outbreak serves as a reminder that governments and partners must continue to focus attention on other emergencies, even as the fight against COVID-19 persists. There is a need for greater investment in strengthening the core capacities of countries in the implementation of the International Health Regulations. Enhancing preparedness will lead to improved response to threats arising from epidemic-prone diseases and result in less social and economic impact.

WHO thanks donors who provided funding to WHO for the Ebola response under the Strategic Response Plan: African Public Health Emergency Fund (APHEF); Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA; Federal Foreign Office, Federal Republic of Germany; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; People's Republic of China; and the United Nations Development Programme Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF).

[2] Ebolavirus disease pathogenesis
Date: Mon 9 Nov 2020

Ebola virus is one of the world's deadliest pathogens, and scientists now report new details of how the virus alters the host immune response for its own benefit during infection. In a study published today [9 Nov 2020] in Cell [see reference below], the researchers identified antiviral defense genes that the virus suppresses and other genes the virus activates to potentially boost its replication in cells.

The scientists, from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, MIT, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Stanford University, and other institutions described how they sampled roughly 100 000 single immune cells from Ebola-infected rhesus monkeys at various stages of disease and studied gene expression and protein activity in each of these cells individually.

The researchers were able to conduct the study -- the 1st ever to sequence single cells infected with a BSL-4 level pathogen -- by using a portable, low-cost technology for single cell RNA sequencing called Seq-Well, which the team adapted for use in a BSL-4 containment facility at the NIH Integrated Research Facility in Fort Detrick, Maryland, USA.

The findings could potentially help researchers find more precise ways to target the immune system as a therapeutic strategy for infections. Dampening the overactive immune system with drugs such as corticosteroids is emerging as a way to treat some infections, including COVID-19, but those drugs often suppress the immune system in blunt ways.

"Treating the immune system in a more targeted way I think is where new therapeutics need to go," said Aaron Lin, co-1st author of the study who did the work at the Broad, in the lab of Pardis Sabeti, an institute member and professor at Harvard University, before starting his postdoctoral fellowship at Princeton University this year [2020]. "Figuring out which branches of the immune system should be targeted can be informed by single-cell studies of infection and other kinds of analyses."

To learn about Ebola's effects on the immune system, the team measured gene and protein activity across the genome in many types of both infected and uninfected immune cells and monitored changes over the course of the disease. Many of the Ebola-induced changes involved monocytes, a type of immune cell that consumes infected cells and is important in battling Ebola.

The researchers found that within the 1st days of infection, subsets of conventional monocytes were replaced by unusual immature monocytes that were less able to present antigens to the immune system -- a key step in stimulating effective immune responses. The virus had downregulated almost all of the genes involved in "class II" antigen presentation in these cells, which normally helps activate helper T cells and boost antibody production.

The researchers also analyzed individual cells with higher amounts of viral genetic material, which likely harbored virus in later phases of its life cycle. The team discovered that as the virus replicated in these cells, it suppressed the cells' ability to produce interferon, a signaling molecule that triggers antiviral responses. The virus also boosted the activity of host genes that researchers think the virus uses to replicate in cells.

"Previous studies of Ebola virus in cells in a dish had generated hints of how the virus affects the immune system, but with more data across the whole genome and better resolution at a single-cell level from a natural infection over time, we got a more complete picture of what the immune system looks like during infection," said Dylan Kotliar, co-1st author of the paper and an MD-PhD student at Harvard Medical School and in the Sabeti lab at the Broad.

The following Highlights and Summary sections have been extracted from the above reference:

Highlights
- Interferon response is suppressed in infected cells but activated in bystander cells
- EBOV represses antiviral genes and upregulates pro-viral genes in infected cells
- Proliferative CD14- CD16- monocyte precursors expand in circulation during EVD
- Identification of expression markers of EBOV tropism for circulating cells in vivo

Summary
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes epidemics with high mortality yet remains understudied due to the challenge of experimentation in high-containment and outbreak settings. Here, we used single-cell transcriptomics and CyTOF-based single-cell protein quantification to characterize peripheral immune cells during EBOV infection in rhesus monkeys. We obtained 100 000 transcriptomes and 15 000 000 protein profiles, finding that immature, proliferative monocyte-lineage cells with reduced antigen-presentation capacity replace conventional monocyte subsets, while lymphocytes upregulate apoptosis genes and decline in abundance. By quantifying intracellular viral RNA, we identify molecular determinants of tropism among circulating immune cells and examine temporal dynamics in viral and host gene expression. Within infected cells, EBOV downregulates STAT1 mRNA and interferon signaling, and it upregulates putative pro-viral genes (such as DYNLL1 and HSPA5), nominating pathways the virus manipulates for its replication. This study sheds light on EBOV tropism, replication dynamics, and elicited immune response and provides a framework for characterizing host-virus interactions under maximum containment.

---
This study moves forward our understanding of the field of molecular pathogenesis of ebolavirus disease, which is made difficult by the need for BSL-4 to conduct the research. The investigators "shed new light on changes in peripheral cell-type and -state abundance throughout lethal EVD, characterized the EBOV-infected populations of circulating immune cells, and identified genes regulated by the cytokine milieu or by direct EBOV infection."
