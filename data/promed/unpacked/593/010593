State health officials said they are investigating a man's death and illnesses of 4 others possibly related to botulism following a New Year's Day dinner in Nome where fermented beluga whale flipper and other traditional Alaska Native foods were served. A "big concern" is the aged beluga flipper that has tested "preliminary positive" for a botulism toxin, said Louisa Castrodale, an epidemiologist with the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. State officials are awaiting final results from the flipper and other foods served at the family potluck, as well as clinical samples from those who fell ill, Castrodale said. The samples were sent to a lab in Richmond, California. Final results are expected late next week.

People close to him say the 54-year-old accomplished whaler who was raised on the Bering Sea island of Little Diomede northwest of Nome became sick the day after eating the flipper with excruciating stomach pain, vomiting, difficulty breathing, double vision and weakness. The man, who prepared the beluga flipper, soon suffered cardiac arrest and slipped into a coma, they said. The man and 3 other adults who got sick, all family members, were treated at the hospital in Nome and then flown to the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage for treatment.

State health officials interviewed 14 people who ate food served at the potluck, said Castrodale. They learned that 5 had botulism-like symptoms, all adults, she said. The illnesses were limited to the dinner and did not spark concern of a broader outbreak across the Northwest Alaska region, she said. Everyone besides the [whaler who died] recovered or is recovering. Some still have stomach pain and weakness, people close to him said. The man died in Anchorage on 15 Jan 2019. "It hit him pretty fast," said his fiancee. She said she did not eat the flipper and did not get sick.

Alaska has more cases of foodborne botulism than other states, according to the CDC. A total of 24 people died and more than 350 fell ill from botulism in Alaska between 1950 and 2017, the agency says. That is about one death every 3 years. The last death from botulism in Alaska occurred in 2014, Castrodale said.

The bacterium can incubate in some traditional Alaska Native foods, including seal oil, dried unsalted fish and aged delicacies such as fermented fish heads, sometimes called "stinky heads." Fermented marine mammal parts such as beluga flipper are also sources, the CDC said. The toxin can cause muscle paralysis within hours or days, with symptoms including slurred speech, difficulty swallowing and breathing, dry mouth and weakness. The traditional way of aging the fish in grass or straw has given way to glass or plastic containers that can increase the risk, according to a state report called "Botulism in Alaska."

The man had safely prepared the beluga flipper many times before, aging the food in a cardboard box to allow air circulation, people close to him said. They said other foods served at the dinner included walrus stew and baked fish. "We got tired of turkey and ham, so we made Eskimo food for dinner and had family over," his fiancee said.

[The following was abstracted from a 2001 CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] report on foodborne botulism in the native American population in Alaska and underscores changes in the fermentation techniques that appear to have increased the risks of this intoxication (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5032a2.htm):

"This report illustrates how the use of nontraditional fermentation methods is associated with foodborne botulism in Alaska. Botulism results from eating preformed toxin produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. Botulism intoxication can result in death, which most often is caused by respiratory failure. The latent period is typically 12 to 36 hours but can range from 6 hours to 10 days (1). _C. botulinum_ and closely related organisms produce toxins designated as types A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Human botulism is most commonly caused by types A, B, and E. Type E is associated with foods of marine or freshwater origin. Alaska's foodborne botulism rates exceed those in any other state and are among the highest in the world (1). During 1950-2000, Alaska recorded 226 cases of foodborne botulism from 114 outbreaks. All patients were Alaska natives, and all cases with known causes were associated with eating fermented foods (1, 2). Approximately 27% of US foodborne botulism cases occur in Alaska.

"In traditional fermentation, food is kept in a grass-lined hole in the ground or a wooden barrel sunken into the ground or is placed in a shady area above ground for several weeks to months. Since the 1970s, however, plastic or glass containers have been used and fermentation has been done above ground or indoors. The anaerobic condition of sealed containers and warmer temperatures make fermentation more rapid and production of botulism toxin more likely (3-5). These nontraditional methods have been associated with increased botulism rates in Alaska during 1970-1989 (4, 5).

"Early diagnosis and antitoxin treatment have contributed to the decline of the case fatality rate from approximately 31% during 1950-1959 to no deaths in Alaska since 1994 (1). However, Alaska continues to have high foodborne botulism rates because fermented foods are part of Alaska Native culture. In a 1999 survey, 107 (77%) of 140 Alaska Natives reported having eaten fermented foods at least once in their lifetime (3)."
