2 cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever have been identified in
Jefferson County, the first cases this year. Both of the individuals
are under 19 years of age.
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is spread by the bite of an
infected tick. In Nebraska, the American dog tick, which is mottled
brown in color, is the most common carrier. The people most at risk
are those who have exposure to tick-infested habitats, such as wooded
and grassy areas.
"With summer here, people will be outdoors more, doing activities
like camping, fishing, hunting, and picnicking," said Dr. Richard
Raymond, the state's Chief Medical Officer, from the Nebraska Health
and Human Services System. "That places them at risk of being bit by
ticks. Having 2 cases so early this year, when we usually only have 3
to 6 cases per year, is worrisome."
Symptoms usually appear within 2 weeks of the bite of an infected
tick. They include the sudden onset of a moderate to high fever
(which can last for 2 or 3 weeks [without treatment - Mod.LL]),
severe headache, fatigue, deep muscle pain, chills and rash.
Antimicrobials can treat the disease.
"Wearing mosquito repellent containing DEET or insecticide containing
permethrin are vitally important, both because we are facing Rocky
Mountain spotted fever and also West Nile virus," said Dr. Raymond.
West Nile is passed by the bite of a mosquito. Mosquitoes can also
carry Western equine encephalitis and St. Louis encephalitis.

[Despite its name, the disease is most common in the middle-Atlantic
states of the USA. Cases occur in practically every USA state. 2
cases in May in a state such as Nebraska suggests an increased
survival of overwintering ticks and portends a higher number of cases
later in the summer. - Mod.LL]
