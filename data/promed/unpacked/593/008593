Since 16 Mar 2007, a total of 10 horses have died on properties
located within the African horse sickness (AHS) Surveillance Zone.
All these deaths were investigated by the Veterinary Authorities with
post mortem examinations either conducted on-farm or at the
Provincial Veterinary Laboratory. Samples were taken and submitted to
the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute (OVI) for diagnostic analysis.
Initial test results on the 1st few cases incriminated AHS virus as
the cause. New diagnostic evidence, based on virus isolation at the
OVI, indicate that there is a distinct probability that other equine
disease viruses might also be involved. This likelihood is currently
under intensive investigation by the Western Cape Veterinary
Services, actively supported by local private-practicing equine
veterinarians, as well as researchers from OVI and the University of
Pretoria's Faculty of Veterinary Science.
Horse owners are requested to report any cases of horses exhibiting
suspicious clinical signs (fever reactions in excess of 39 C coupled
to general malaise and/or difficult breathing, sometimes ending in
peracute deaths) to their veterinarians so that the necessary
investigations can be done to try and accurately establish the exact
cause(s) of these cases.
Various infectious agents able to cause disease in equines are under
suspicion, including equine encephalosis virus. African horse
sickness virus has also not been eliminated as the cause of the
current disease outbreak, whether alone or possibly in combination
with other infectious organisms. As outbreaks of AHS directly impact
on the export of horses from the AHS Free Area, the real cause of
these cases would have to be established to the satisfaction of the
World Animal Health Organisation (OIE) and the veterinary authorities
of our equine trading partner countries.
As the cause(s) of these cases have not been unequivocally confirmed
by laboratory isolation and identification of the causative agent(s),
the current movement ban would have to be maintained, in fact even
extended, as detailed below.
The current ban, issued as a Notice in terms of the Animal Diseases
Act, 1984 (Act 35 of 1984, as amended) will come into effect on the
issue date of this Notice and will now include the following
restrictions and areas:
1. A total ban on all movements of equines (horses, donkeys, mules
and zebra) within, into, through, or out of the whole of the African
horse sickness Surveillance Zone and AHS Free Area (see description
of areas and map attached hereto).
2. This ban will be in operation until cancelled by a Notice issued
similarly as above.
3. Cancellation or modification of this Notice will only be
considered once the Veterinary Authorities have determined the exact
cause and possible effects of this pathogen and established the
necessary disease control strategies.
4. The above movement ban includes movements of equines out of the
areas specified above to the rest of the country. This differs from
the previous ban in that AHS was the only consideration then, but now
unknown factors have to be taken into consideration.
5. Previously, the ban allowed for movement in and between other
districts not specifically mentioned as high risk areas, under cover
of a State Veterinary Movement Permit. For the whole of the AHS
Surveillance Zone and Free Area, this has now been cancelled as
indicated in 1. above.
6. All pertinent authorities (inclusive of the Provincial and
Municipal Traffic Inspectorates and the SA Police Services) will be
requested to police this ban and take appropriate action against transgressors.
7. The need and applicable areas for compulsory vaccination against
African horse sickness will be revised and communicated shortly.
Decisions regarding this aspect of disease control obviously depend
on laboratory diagnostic results.
Full compliance by all involved parties is a prerequisite in our
combined attempts to safeguard our horses, especially as the specific
cause of these deaths has not been satisfactorily established. In the
face of such an unknown challenge to the whole country's horse
population, severe limitation of horse movements is a prerequisite.
This, coupled with practices involving excellent feeding, husbandry
and biting insect control, is the only disease prevention actions
that can currently be advised.
As requested previously, all horse owners and organizers of equine
shows, meetings and competitions throughout the country are urgently
requested to postpone imminent major horse gatherings until more
clarity with respect to this epidemic is obtained. These are major
decisions, but can, in the long run, only be advantageous to the
local as well as national equine industry and sporting codes.
Description of the African Horse Sickness Surveillance Zone and the
African Horse Sickness Free Area:
It is the area south of the Berg River (forming the Northern border
from it's mouth in the Atlantic Ocean at Velddrift to just south of
the Voelvlei Dam in the East) and to the West of the Hawequa, Du
Toit's Kloof, Klein Drakenstein, Franschhoek, and Hottentot-Hollands
mountain ranges (forming the Eastern border and stretching from the
North opposite Voelvlei Dam to it's most southerly point of Cape
Hangklip). This area contains the magisterial districts of
Moorreesburg, Vredenburg, Hopefield, Malmesbury, Wellington, Paarl,
Stellenbosch, Bellville, Kraaifontein, Cape (Milnerton), Somerset
West, Strand, Kuils River, Mitchell's Plain, Goodwood, Wynberg, and
Simon's Town inclusive of the whole Cape Town Metropole.

It appears that this type of outbreak has happened before and
highlights the value of a surveillance zone specifically and
geographically-based disease control strategies in general.
If you want an idea of what it will take to lift the restriction just
imposed on the surveillance zone, the following is a description of
the cleanup work after a similar outbreak in 2004, according to the
Western Cape Department of Agriculture:
"A dedicated staff component from the Directorate Veterinary Services
inspected 4848 horses on 1616 holdings to monitor the disease. The
Department of Agriculture also supplied 1400 doses of AHS vaccine
free to farmers in the area and worked in close collaboration with
private veterinarians to ensure that as many horses as possible were
vaccinated within the shortest space of time. There was also very
close cooperation with personnel from Disaster Management, the
Provincial Traffic Department and the South African Police Services
who together assisted the Department in containing the outbreak by
restricting and policing horse movements." For the full notification see
<http://www.capegateway.gov.za/eng/pubs/news/2004/may/70497>.
As the information above indicates, it is imperative that people stop
moving their horses, that vaccination strategies are implemented with
complete thoroughness and that horse owners report sick animals
promptly. Only in these ways can the costs of the disease in horse
deaths and restrictions be minimized. - Mod.PC]
