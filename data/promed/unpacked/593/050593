'Red tide' in Sabah prompts Brunei fish ban
------------------------------------------------------
The Brunei government has banned the import of several species
of fish from Sabah following an occurrence of the "red tide"
phenomenon off Kuala Penyu and Kota Kinabalu.
Brunei was alerted to the contamination by the Sabah Fisheries
Department, which said "the waters of Sabah, especially in Kuala
Penyu and Kota Kinabalu, are contaminated by the red-tide toxin".
This prompted the sultanate to immediately ban the import of fish,
such as mackerel and sardines, from Sabah.
Brunei has already banned the import of molluscs such as oysters,
cockles and mussels harvested from Kuala Penyu and Kota
Kinabalu waters.
