US company in Pakistan hit by anthrax
-----------------------------------------------
Senior executives at 2 business organisations in Karachi -- an
(American-owned) international bank and a computer-marketing firm --
received international mail that carried anthrax spores mixed with
some powdery material last week.

A senior staffer at the main laboratory of Aga Khan University and
Hospital (AKUH) in Karachi confirmed on Monday that the laboratory
test on 2 specimens received from these organisations on Friday last
showed that one of the 2 specimens was loaded with anthrax while the
other one had some traces of the bacterium, _Bacillus anthracis_.

Another senior executive at the Aga Khan hospital has informed The
News that soon after the detection of anthrax, a detailed report was
sent to the government of Pakistan health officials both here and in
Islamabad with recommendations to create public awareness.

Medical experts say that since first cases of anthrax have already
been confirmed in Pakistan the authorities must immediately launch a
public awareness exercise because almost all forms of anthrax if
caught early enough can be cured by prompt antibiotic treatment, [but
if it is left untreated, it kills about 1 in 5 people. Requesting
anonymity a senior ministry of health official in Karachi confirmed
that Aga Khan hospital has reported the first case of anthrax in
Pakistan and the matter has been referred to top federal authorities
in Islamabad who were considering the pros and cons of making a public
disclosure.

The first anthrax-carrying mail, sources in the affected business
organisations said, was addressed to the joint-president of a
Zurich-based Pakistani bank and it had originated from New York city.
A Karachi computer company that deals in American brands had also
received dusty anthrax material in a mail envelope.

Employees from both organisations who may have handled the mail were
later given penicillin at Aga Khan hospital. [Penicillin is effective
against cutaneous but not against inhalation anthrax. - Mod.JW A
senior security official in Karachi has also confirmed that
intelligence agencies have been ordered to trace the roots of the new
anthrax threat to Pakistan.

An official source said that a strategy was being debated in
consultation with the Post Master General to caution the postal staff
on domestic and international mail that may carry anthrax.

No Incidence of Anthrax in Pakistan: Health Authorities
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Pakistan's health authorities on Wednesday said that there was no case
of anthrax in Pakistan and there was no need to panic.

"There were 3 reported cases, one in Islamabad and 2 in Karachi.
However, the laboratory tests have confirmed these as negative," the
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) quoted Executive Director of the
National Institute of Health (NIH) Dr. Athar Saeed Dilld as saying.
The first case was reported from the British High Commission in
Islamabad, while 2 others were reported in Karachi. "Proper tests were
conducted which proved these reports in the negative," he stated.

Dilld said there was absolutely no need to panic. On the other hand,
he said, all necessary measures have been taken to deal with any such
situation.

Three anthrax centres set up in Capital
-----------------------------------------------
The health ministry, in collaboration with Islamabad Capital Territory
(ICT) administration and different health institutes, has set up 3
Anthrax Crisis Centres (ACCs) in the federal capital.

A source told Dawn on Tuesday that these centres had been established
at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Pakistan Institute of
Medical Sciences (PIMS) and Islamabad Services Hospital (Poly
Clinic). He said special arrangements had been made at the centres to
trace the deadly bacterial disease and give treatment to affected
people. So far, only one suspected patient had been under observation
in Islamabad, but preliminary analysis proved that the case was
negative.

Medicines like ciprofloxacin, penicillin and tetracycline, that are
usually given to [anthrax patients, are easily available in the
market at reasonable rates, he added. The source said the health
ministry had directed all local drug manufacturing companies and
stockholders to manufacture and stock maximum quantities of the 3
drugs to meet any eventuality.

[Clearly there are conflicting reports of anthrax contaminated letters
in Pakistan. We at ProMED-mail have been concerned about not
contributing to the rumor mill by posting false alarms. However, we
have had a personal communication from a usually reliable source that
states:

"We have [received confirmed reports that 7 nasal swab cultures
tested at the Aga Khan University Hospital [AKUH were positive for
_Bacillus anthracis_ from bank employees. Also, one employee of the
bank who was admitted to AKUH with fever and myalgia is probably
suffering from a viral syndrome, his cultures have been negative [for
anthrax after 48 hours and he looks quite good".

ProMED-mail would very much appreciate more official information. -
