[Contrary to this article's headline, the 4th wave of avian influenza H7N9 in China has already begun; there have been cases reported this season in Zhejiang as posted earlier on ProMED-mail. 4 cases were reported in ProMED-mail Avian influenza, human (124): China, H7N9 20151109.3779443, and 2 additional cases in ProMED mail Avian influenza, human (125): China (ZJ) H7N9, 4th wave H7N9 20151118.3801312. It is not clear why there is a discrepancy in this latest report.

H7N9 has become well established in poultry populations in southeastern parts of China, and the virus can cause mild to severe disease in humans exposed to infected poultry.
