[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 1 273 709 with 81 708 (6.4%) cases reported by China. There are now a total of 1 192 001 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 212 countries/locations outside mainland China, representing an increase of 71 737 cases when compared with the data on 4 Apr 2020, with the USA accounting for 25 473 (35.5%), Italy for 4316 (6.0%), Spain for 5478 (7.6%), and Germany for 4031 (5.6%) of the newly confirmed cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside China now represents 93.6% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA. The USA now represents 28.3% of the global cases of COVID-19. The USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, have overtaken China in total numbers of cases. A global total of 69 456 deaths have been reported, 66 125 (95.2%) outside mainland China. As it was Sunday when this report was prepared, not all countries were submitting complete reports and therefore one should be cautious about interpreting major decreases in daily reported cases until there are several consecutive days showing there is a trend.

It is now clear that while China has the largest population in the world and was the original location where the COVID-19 outbreak started, it has markedly reduced transmission to a manageable level, now monitoring all arrivals in the country from outside. South Korea has slowly decreased daily, new case counts hovering around 100 in recent days. The USA is now number one outside China for numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19, Italy is number 2, and Spain is number 3. Iran has slowed down in growth rate and Turkey has been accelerating. Turkey illustrates how rapidly things can increase: the 1st confirmed case was reported on 11 Mar 2020 and in 24 days the country has confirmed 27 069 cases and it now ranks number 9 out of 212 countries/territories in terms of absolute numbers of confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]

[3] A. Google location data used for tracking population movements
Date: Fri 3 Apr 2020 2:00 AM EDT
Source: The Verge [edited]
https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206318/google-location-data-mobility-reports-covid-19-privacy


Google is using location data gathered from smartphones to help public health officials understand how people's movements have changed in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In a blog post early Friday morning [3 Apr 2020], Google announced the release of its COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/).

The reports use data from people who have opted in to storing their location history with Google to help illustrate the degree to which people are adhering to government instructions to shelter in place and, where possible, work from home.

"As global communities respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing emphasis on public health strategies, like social distancing measures, to slow the rate of transmission," the company said in a blog post. "In Google Maps, we use aggregated, anonymized data showing how busy certain types of places are -- helping identify when a local business tends to be the most crowded. We have heard from public health officials that this same type of aggregated, anonymized data could be helpful as they make critical decisions to combat COVID-19."

Anyone can view the reports, which cover 131 countries to start. In many locations, users can search for more regional data, examining reports for individual states, provinces, and counties. After the user selects a geographic region, Google will generate a PDF with the data it has collected. Google said that it chose PDFs over web pages because they could be more easily downloaded and shared with workers in the field.

Each report contains information about movement patterns in 6 categories:
- Retail and recreation, covering visits to restaurants, cafes, shopping centers, theme parks, museums, libraries, movie theaters, and similar locations.
- Grocery and pharmacy, covering supermarkets, food warehouses, farmers markets, specialty food shops, and drug stores.
- Parks, covering public beaches, marinas, dog parks, plazas, and other public spaces.
- Transit stations, covering subway stops and bus and train stations.
- Workplaces, covering offices.
- Residences, covering people's homes.

A sample report viewed by The Verge for California, where a shelter in place order has been in effect since [19 Mar 2020], showed steep declines to retail and recreation locations and transit stations, with a moderate uptick in time spent at home.

Data covers the past 48 to 72 hours, Google said, and the percentage changes reflect the difference between movement this month [Apr 2020] and late January [2020].

The move comes as technology companies have been asked by government agencies and health officials to share more data to aid in the coronavirus response. On Saturday [4 Apr 2020], the Wall Street Journal reported that mobile advertising companies were similarly sharing anonymized, aggregated data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-tracking-how-people-move-around-in-coronavirus-pandemic-11585393202), as well state and local governments, to help officials understand the spread of the disease and coordinate their response.

Facebook has made similar data available to academic researchers (https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-facebook-location/in-coronavirus-fight-oft-criticized-facebook-data-aids-u-s-cities-states-idUSKBN21K3BJ).

Google executives told me its program is intended to aid public health officials who need to prioritize their response based on areas of greater need. The reports may help a county official understand that its parks remain overcrowded despite an order to shelter in place, for example -- or that its parks are properly empty, but its transit stations remain too crowded. That would allow them to consider changing or amplifying messages to their communities about the need to stay away.

At the same time, a high-level look at changing mobility patterns by itself is likely to be of limited value in managing the response to the pandemic. Countries that have had more success in fighting COVID-19 have done so by implementing aggressive testing and contact-tracing regimes, and also by making invasive use of location data. Taiwan, for example, is using location data to create "electronic fences" around quarantined citizens, monitoring their movements to ensure they remain at home.

Google's data does not include personally identifiable information or show the number of visits to any particular category. And it has limits: for example, it may not be able to account for people who spend time near a location as part of permitted outdoor exercise routines.

The company considered requests from public health officials to make more data available for contact tracing -- using an individual's location to identify other people who may have been around them during the time they were infectious. But Google's location data isn't granular enough to determine whether someone came within 6 feet [2 m] of them -- the distance currently thought to bring someone within risk of transmission -- and it contains enough errors to make contact tracing impractical.

Google also considered using location history data to show how crowded hospitals and other medical facilities had become. But location data can't distinguish between healthcare workers, patients, and visitors, making the value of sharing such information questionable.

Google plans to update the data in the reports in the future, it said, but at the moment has not decided when.

Separately, Google said it would collaborate with epidemiologists working on COVID-19 to update an existing dataset of aggregated, anonymized information to forecast the path of the pandemic.

B. Vodafone tracking data
Date: 5 Apr 2020 12:00 AM AEST
Source: The Sydney Morning Herald [edited, abridged]
https://www.smh.com.au/technology/mobile-phone-location-data-used-to-track-australians-movements-during-coronavirus-crisis-20200404-p54h09.html


Vodafone has provided the mobile phone location data of several million Australians in an anonymised and aggregated form to the federal and NSW [New South Wales] governments to monitor whether people are following social distancing restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic. To date, governments, medical experts, and the media have used location data from transport apps such as CityMapper, which shows how people move throughout cities like Sydney and Melbourne using public transport, in an attempt to determine whether people's movement has reduced.

But such data is limited in its use as it relies on active usage of one app alone -- an app that isn't necessarily used by a large percentage of Australians. Google has also published an Australian report based on Google Maps and how its users' movements have changed. Mobile phone location data of millions of users from one of Australia's telco providers, however, can provide a clearer picture.

In a statement to the Sun-Herald and Sunday Age, Vodafone Australia's director of corporate affairs, Dan Lloyd, said the telco had "provided, on request, aggregated network information to the NSW Department of Customer Service and the federal Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet". "This information simply shows the total number of subscribers in various areas at points in time," Mr Lloyd said. "This information can help show trends in population movements immediately before and after the lockdown measures with the aim of assisting in the reduction of the spread of COVID-19."

The Prime Minister's office directed the Sun-Herald and Sunday Age to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, which confirmed via a departmental spokesperson that "a telecommunications provider in Australia offered PM&C aggregated, anonymised data showing how busy cities like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are currently compared with this time last year". "This data can provide a picture of the effectiveness of measures taken to address the COVID-19 crisis generally," the spokesperson said, adding that "no personal information has been provided to PM&C by any telecommunications company nor was it requested".

A government source said Vodafone approached the PM's department first to offer the data. Telstra and Optus did not say whether they also provided location data to authorities. NSW Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello said the NSW government's number one priority was community safety and saving lives. "Privacy and the rights of our citizens are paramount, we cannot and do not try to determine individual movement. Any data we use is anonymised and subject to rigorous privacy and security settings," Mr Dominello said. "The more we can measure and model this virus, the better we can respond to it and the more lives we can save."

But Mr Dominello said NSW would "absolutely not" consider using telco data to enforce isolation of people by checking whether they leave their premises. The terms "anonymised" and "aggregated" mean the data is displayed in a summary form for purposes such as statistical analysis. In theory, this means individuals cannot be identified in it. The ability for individuals to be tracked using mobile location data is possible but with legal hurdles.

NSW Health said it had not requested data from telcos to track an individual's movements but that it was investigating the use of a range of technologies to enhance its contact tracing process, whereby it identifies those who need to self-isolate after coming into contact with a coronavirus carrier.

In the early days of the outbreak in February [2020], South Australia's [SA] health department used an Apple iPhone's inbuilt location services in a bid to trace the historical movements of a couple diagnosed with coronavirus. "The use of phone data was a very unique situation," an SA Health spokeswoman said. "The couple involved didn't speak much English and were unfamiliar with Adelaide so weren't able to clearly recount where they had been to contact tracers." The couple volunteered their phones to South Australia Police, who worked with SA's Chief Public Health Officer to analyse the data.

[Fascinating use of location data. The South Koreans have been using GPS to track the movement of SARS-CoV-2 positive patients as well, and there are apps that the general public can use that show where these individuals have been and are currently. Very helpful information/feedback for government/public health policies. New York City closed playgrounds when they saw that people were crowding the playgrounds and not maintaining social distancing. - Mod.MPP]

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- One new country/territory/area reported cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours: Falkland Islands (Malvinas).

- The Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Dr Etienne, on Friday [3 Apr 2020], called for the collaboration of the private sector with countries of Latin America and the Caribbean to tackle COVID-19. More details can be found at https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15770.

- PAHO has launched a new searchable database that contains the latest guidance and research on the COVID-19 pandemic from the Americas and affected countries worldwide. The press release is available at https://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=15769 and the database is available at https://covid19-evidence.paho.org/.

- As China emerges from a 2 month containment phase and moves into the mitigation stage, its experience is helping countries currently at the start of the COVID-19 cycle to plan their responses better. This is explored in an interview with WHO Representative to China, Dr Gauden Galea [http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-emergencies/coronavirus-covid-19/news/news/2020/4/china-shows-covid-19-responses-must-be-tailored-to-the-local-context]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China now totals 207. This includes 18 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 from the Southeast Asia region, 21 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 53 countries (including 18 territories) from the Americas region, and 45 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region is reporting 36 171 new cases (in the past 24 hours) of which 88.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Canada (3.3%) and Brazil (3.2%). Recognizing the USA data are overshadowing the regional proportions, without the reported newly confirmed cases from the USA, Canada reported 29.7% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Brazil at 28.2%, and Chile at 10.4%

The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 38 266 (46.6% of the global newly reported cases) new cases and 4082 (70.4%) deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Spain accounting for 18.4% of newly confirmed cases, Italy for 12.6% of newly confirmed cases, Germany for 15.5% of newly confirmed cases, and France for 11.0% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 4 countries accounting for 57.5 % of newly confirmed cases in Europe.

In the Eastern Mediterranean region, Iran reported 2560 new cases representing 59.1% of the regional newly reported cases. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) represent 10.0%, 7.6%, 5.8% and 5.6% respectively. Removing Iran from the denominator, Pakistan represents 24.3% of newly reported cases, followed by Saudi Arabia at 18.7%, Qatar at 14.1%, and the UAE at 13.6%

In the African region, Cameroon reported 31.7% of the newly reported cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria with 27.2% and South Africa at 8.2%. of the newly reported cases in the region.

In the Western Pacific region, Japan reported 35.9% of the newly reported cases (outside of China), Australia reported 18.5% of the newly confirmed cases, followed by the Malaysia at 15.3%.

In South East Asia, India reported 83.3% of newly confirmed cases, followed by Indonesia at 8.2% and Thailand at 6.9% of newly reported cases.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [5 Apr 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. The curve seems to show Europe plateauing, but the Americas are adding to the overall height of the curve on a daily basis. The 24 hour newly reported case total for the European region was 38 266 today compared with 36 171 for the Americas region..

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
