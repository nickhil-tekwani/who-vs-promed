[The following information was extracted from the APHIS- VS web page.
There is additional information with regard to BSE and the Canadian
situation. This is new today. - Mod.TG]
On Tue 3 Jun 2003, Canada reported to USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) that their investigation indicates that 5
bulls from one of the potential source herds in Canada were sold to a
farm in Montana.
Following up on this information, APHIS and Montana State veterinary
officials are in the initial stages of conducting an investigation in
an effort to determine the final disposition of these animals. This
investigation is consistent with the investigation ongoing in Canada
and will contribute to that overall investigation.
So far, records indicate that the animals were born in Saskatchewan
in 1996 and left Canada for Montana on 28 Apr 1997. Through an
initial review of brand inspection records and interviews with the
Montana farm rancher, investigators have determined that 11 bulls
were sold from this farm to one stockyard in Montana and 2 in South
Dakota from 1999 to 2002. Presumably the 5 bulls in question were
included in these 11 animals.
State and APHIS personnel are working with the owners and will be
contacting the market operators to determine the final disposition of
these bulls. For several reasons, USDA believes it is unlikely that
any of the bulls were infected with BSE:
--The Canadian herd that the bulls came from was depopulated, and
those the cattle have tested negative for BSE, including cattle born
in the same year as the positive cow.
--Research indicates that a low dose of infection results in a longer
incubation period. As the infected animal in Canada was 7-8 years
old, that suggests that the infected animal received a low dose of
BSE. Any exposure of BSE to other animals in that herd would be even
lower.
--In Europe, where animal exposure to BSE was greatest, herds
affected by BSE typically have a very low prevalence of disease and
usually do not have additional positive cows in infected herds.
--If investigation reveals that the bulls were slaughtered, it was
after implementation of the FDA feed ban, thus ensuring that these
animals did not enter the animal food chain.
--Consistent with the science and international standards, we know
that bovine semen is not a means of transmitting the disease. So, the
fact that these were breeding bulls is not a concern.
Canada is no longer issuing health certificates on animals or animal
products that state Canada is free of BSE.
