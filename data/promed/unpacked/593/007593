Regarding your recent posting of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE] in Montana, the news article that you cite is a retrospective piece looking at news from the same date 50 years prior. The cases of EEE reported are from 1965.

EEE is highly unlikely in Montana. The actual piece refers simply to equine encephalitis and doesn't specify eastern. Our suspicion is this was actually western equine encephalitis [WEE], since Montana does not have any historically documented cases of EEE.

Regarding "EEE" in Montana, _Culiseta melanura_ doesn't come anywhere near Montana. Its westernmost distribution ends somewhere in the middle of Minnesota, as I recall. That means the natural cycle of EEE is very unlikely to exist in Montana. The Montana horse cases are most likely either WEE or WNV [West Nile virus] if they are vector borne.

[I appreciate my alert readers rightfully pointing out that EEE is not in Montana, and that the article that prompted the posting (though current) was a re-posting of a piece from The Great Falls Tribune 50 years ago. Cases of equine encephalitis in Montana would more likely be caused by western equine encephalitis or West Nile virus, but no cases have been reported recently. My thanks to the readers who wrote regarding this posting and my apology for the errors. - Mod.TG
