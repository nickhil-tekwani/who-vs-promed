Regarding the comment that tertiary syphilis affects the cerebellum.
Actually, the gait disturbance classically described in tertiary or
neurosyphilis is due to posterior sensory column degeneration in the spinal
cord (tabes dorsalis). As syphilis is "the great imitator", it probably
has produced cerebellar dysfunction (in probably the gummatous or
meningovascular form); however, cerebellar involvement is not typical of
neurosyphilis. One infectious disease that has been classically noted to
result in cerebellar ataxia is varicella encephalitis. This is generally
noted during or just after the encephalitis, and is felt to be due to
post-infectious demyelination.

Canine Distemper virus (CDV), a morbillivirus, causes cerebellar lesions in
infected dogs, usually in association with panencephalitis, myelitis, optic
tract involvement and multisystem disease. Cerebellar lesions typically
include Purkinje and glial cell degeneration with mononuclear cell
infiltrate, eosinophilic inclusion bodies and
demyelination. Clinical signs specifically referable to cerebellar disease
do occur but more commonly these are swamped by signs associated
panencephalitis and other systems failure. The disease is highly
contagious, has a worldwide distribution and is invariably fatal. Most
canids, some mustelids, some pinnnipeds and some felids are susceptible.
Complete clinical, epidemiological and histopathological descriptions can
be found in standard Veterinary texts.
Other related morbilliviruses such as the phocid distemper viruses and
cetacean distemper viruses can cause similar clinical syndromes in their
hosts but I am unsure about cerebellar involvement.
Cerebellar lesions are also reported in cats with feline panleukopenia
(parvovirus) infection.

A very brief search of veterinary pathology texts for animal diseases with
predominantly cerebellar involvement included: enterovirus (avian
encephalomyelitis, Teschen disease, porcine encephalomyelitis), togavirus
(louping ill) and possibly [rhabdovirus rabies (Purkinje cells are one of
the most common sites of Negri bodies). In addition, prenatal cerebellar
hypoplasia is caused by parvoviruses (feline and murine), togaviruses
(bovine virus diarrhea, Border disease and hog cholera), and arenaviruses
(lymphocytic choriomeningitis) in rats. Cerebellitis is also not uncommon
with many viral, bacterial and rickettsial diseases with generalized CNS
involvement.

Feline panleukopenia virus (FLV), a parvovirus, also targets cerebellar
tissue in domestic cats either in utero or during the early postnatal
period (up to 9 days after birth). Both the external cell granular layer
and Purkinje cells are disrupted irreversibly with degeneration of the
granuloprival layers. Clinical signs are typical of cerebellar hypoplasia,
with ataxia and intention tremors. Live attenuated FLV vaccine can also
cause cerebellar hypoplasia in kittens vaccinated before 3 weeks of age, or
kittens born to queens vaccinated during gestation.

[All fascinating and we thank the contributors, but we must move on. I do
not have sufficient intellectual curiosity to ask what a "queen" is. Like
the boy who read the book about penguins and said, "I now know more about
penguins than I wanted to know", I have had enough. String cut. - Mod.CHC
