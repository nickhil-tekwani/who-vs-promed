The Health Ministry announced Thursday [24 Nov 2005] that, contrary
to an earlier announcement, it is possible that an Israeli man may
have contracted a virulent strain of the avian flu. The man's blood
will be further tested both in Israel and England, the ministry said.
Officials at Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed, where the Galilee
resident, 57, was hospitalized last weekend, said he has recovered
and will be released Friday [25 Nov 2005]. In addition, tests carried
out by the Agriculture Ministry on birds in the Lake Hula nature
reserve, where the man is employed, did not find any birds carrying
the virus.
The Health Ministry reported Tuesday [22 Nov 2005] that it was
examining suspicions that the Galilee resident, who feeds birds at
the nature reserve, had contracted avian flu. A test on saliva taken
from his pharynx showed that he did not carry the virus, but on
Thursday it was revealed that his blood tests raised suspicions that
he had the disease, and had probably contracted a virulent strain of
the virus.
Health Ministry officials said the chances that the man has bird flu
are very low, but the man's blood will nonetheless be tested at Sheba
Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, and in England.
In October 2005, several dozen birds infected with the virus were
found in Russia, Romania, Turkey and Greece. In some of the cases,
they were proven to have been infected with the virulent strain that
has infected some 120 people in Asia, killing about 60 of them.
No bird in Israel has been found carrying the virulent virus, and no country
in the world has diagnosed a human carrying the virus without an infected bird
being found in its area previously.

[The clinical symptoms of the patient, admitted to hospital several
days after disease onset, included high fever (40C/104F), cough,
headache, weakness, pneumonia and slight diarrhoea. When he later
disclosed his involvement in feeding migratory birds it was apparent
the case met the clinical and epidemiologic criteria for avian
influenza.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Health's Guidelines for Isolation
Precautions in Hospitals relating to avian influenza suspected cases
were put into operation (for the 1st time in Israel) and samples were
sent to the Central Virology Laboratory, Ministry of Health, Chaim
Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer. Real-time PCR and RT-PCR of
pharyngeal swabs for H5 were applied with negative results; the
testing of bronchoalveolar lavage, which requires invasive
procedures, was considered but was found not justifiable in view of
the improvement in the patient's condition.
When the serological test (HI) was later found positive, the decision
was made to repeat the tests and to send serum samples to the
UK-based influenza reference laboratory for serum neutralisation
tests.
The Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture) have been operating
a field surveillance scheme for H5N1 since October 2005, covering
both domestic as well as wild avians. The survey in wild birds
includes sampling and testing of sick or dead birds; allegedly,
several hundred samples have already been tested, all with negative
results. It has been contemplated to include, in the near future, the
testing of randomly sampled healthy wild birds as well. According to
the plan, this survey, to be cooperatively applied with the Nature
Reserve Authority, will be combined with the birds' ringing [banding].
Israel is a main flyway of migratory birds on their route from Europe
to the Near East and Africa; it is estimated that around 500 million
birds pass through Israel annually in each direction. - Mod.AS]
[Blood tests for antibody will not identify virulent H5N1, only the sequencing
of PCR-amplified genome will. Even a seroconversion between his early and late
blood samples, or the finding of IgM antibody, would not prove conclusively
that his illness was due to H5N1 virus; he might have had a mild infection and
his pneumonia could have been due to a different cause. - Mod.CP/JW]
