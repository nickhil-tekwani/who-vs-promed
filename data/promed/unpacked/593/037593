An alert has been sounded by Northern Ireland veterinary officials for
brucellosis after over 30 outbreaks were confirmed in the province. Dr. Bob
McCracken, deputy CVO for the Ministry of Agriculture, said "We are a bit
disturbed and alarmed at the present situation for we thought this was
something which we had largely eradicated, with only the occasional
outbreak." Farmers are urged to inform divisional veterinary offices of any
bovine abortions.
