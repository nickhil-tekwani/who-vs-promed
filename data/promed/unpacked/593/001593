2. Situation update
-------------------
China:
Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in Liaoning province on 3 Aug 2018, 113 ASF outbreaks [have been] detected in 28 provinces / autonomous region / municipalities. More than 950 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.
Sichuan province: On 10 Mar 2019 at a toll station for G65 highway in the south of Linshui County, Guang'an City, Sichuan province, a pig transport trailer of external origin was seized; it carried 150 pigs, of which 9 were dead, and tested positive for ASF virus nucleic acid.

Viet Nam:
Since the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) confirmed its ASF outbreaks on 19 Feb 2019, a total of 221 outbreaks have been reported in 17 provinces/cities, and more than 23 400 pigs have been culled. Viet Nam has implemented movement control of pigs and pig products from affected communes; ASF-positive farms have been depopulated according to the emergency response action plan against ASF. MARD has proposed further control plans.

Between 8 and 14 Mar [2019], ASF outbreaks were reported in: Thai Binh (40 communes), Hung Yen (21), Hai Phong (16), Hai Duong (11), Ha Noi (7), Ha Nam (4), Thanh Hoa (4), Dien Bien (3), Quang Ninh (3), Thai Nguyen (2), Hoa Binh (1), Nam Dinh (1), Ninh Binh (1), Son La (1), Bac Kan (1), Lang Son (1), and Nghe An (1).

3. [New] actions taken by China
-------------------------------
Following a retrospective analysis of the 111 outbreaks, MARA pointed out that more than 60% of outbreaks were detected through investigation and monitoring before causing further economic losses; prompt disposal prevented secondary spread. The proportion of outbreaks caused by live pigs and pork products movement dropped from 35% to 15%, and the proportion of outbreaks caused by swill feeding dropped from 50% to 44% by prohibiting the use of kitchen waste for pig feed. A dead pig was found on the Lesser Kinmen Island near Shaxibao, Liyu Township, Jinmen County, Taiwan, on 12 Mar 2019 and tested positive for ASF virus nucleic acid. The location was about 6 km [3.7 mi] from Xiamen City, China, and very close to the mouth of the Jiulong River. There are no pig farms within a 3 km [1.9 mi] radius. ASF virus gene was also detected from: La-Zhuer (smoked pig's ear) brought by a passenger on 1 Mar 2019 from Chengdu City, Sichuan province, via Sichuan Airlines, and the gene sequence showed 100% identity with ASF virus elsewhere in China; and dried pork (produced by Linyi, Shandong province) brought by a passenger to Kaohsiung Xiaogang Airport on 7 Mar 2019 from Fuzhou province via Fudong Airlines. The gene sequence of these samples showed 100% identity with ASF virus elsewhere in China.

4. FAO's [new] actions
----------------------
An FAO Emergency Management Centre for Animal Health mission to Viet Nam was initiated this week [week of Mon 11 Mar 2019] to assess ASF situation and response strategy.

FAO plans to participate at the forthcoming international symposium on ASF (Beijing, April 2019).

[The above FAO update also includes the following tables:

Table 1. List of affected cities in China since 3 Aug 2018 (for each province, the name of the last city affected and the date of the last reported onset are given).

Table 2. List of affected provinces in Viet Nam since 19 Feb 2019 (for each province, the number of communes affected and the date of the last reported onset are given).

The number of outbreaks reported from Viet Nam since the start of the ASF event, 19 Feb 2019, most probably introduced from China, is significantly higher than those reported from China since the reported start of the event there, namely 3 Aug 2018. It could be questioned if this difference reflects an actual higher spread rate in Viet Nam or a difference in the reporting method/quality between the 2 countries. - Mod.AS
