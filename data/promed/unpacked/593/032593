Rabies torments Amudat camels
------------------------------
Pokot pastoralists in Amudat [map at http://healthmap.org/r/0JMT]
are gripped with fear following an outbreak of rabies which is killing
animals in the district. The disease has reportedly killed 6 camels
while several others have gone wild and are straying.

Dr Michael Kasiro, the Amudat District veterinary officer, yesterday
[21 Apr 2011] said a team of experts is on the ground to investigate
the source of the disease. He expressed fear that the disease, which
is currently in Loro Sub-county, could spread throughout the district
if not well handled [see comment, below].

"The disease started attacking a camel which later ran mad and it
started jumping up and down, biting other animals, before it died.
Unfortunately, we now suspect that many more animals have been
infected," Dr Kasiro said. He said the team, composed of the local
staff, is now trying to kill all the animals that have gone wild so as
to prevent the spread of the disease. Dr Kasiro added that the
district is still grappling with the foot and mouth disease [FMD]. "We
are still stuck with FMD. We have not yet finished with vaccination
because we are waiting for more drugs," he added.

Rabies is a viral disease of the nervous system of animals.

[Though rabies seems the likely etiologic factor of the described
event, there are other infectious and non-infectious diseases which
can present CNS signs in camels; a laboratory confirmation is
advisable.

Rabies is an infectious viral disease affecting all warm-blooded
animals and man. Clinical signs of dromedary camel rabies have been
reported in 1993 by Afzal and colleagues. (Vet Rec. 1993; 133(9):
220). They included hyper-excitability, attacking inanimate objects,
self-biting of forelimbs, salivation sternal recumbency, paralysis of
hind legs, and death within 3-7 days. There have been more recent
descriptions of rabies in camels in at least 2 provinces in Sudan.
According to one of them (ref 1) from North Kordofan State, 2001, as
many as 19 camels were reportedly affected. This large number was
attributed to several factors, the most prominent being "the madness
of the offender dog, animals close contact with each other and the
site of the bites (upper and lower lips)." Another, later (2005),
description from Sudan is available at
http://sudanjvr.net/10-21.html.

In Israel, about 1 per cent of lab-confirmed rabies cases in animals
during the period 1948 to 1997, were seen in dromedary camels (ref
2).

Though camels, as other herbivores, are not regarded as vectors but
rather as dead-end victims of rabies, their notorious tendency to bite
may play a role in the increased exposure of herd-mates and humans to
infection.
