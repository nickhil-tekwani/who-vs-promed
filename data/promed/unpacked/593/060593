Investigations into the outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ subtype]
Typhimurium phage type 42 have found a detection of the bacteria in
samples of flour taken from the home of one of the affected people. A
further sample, from a 2nd case's home, has been provisionally
confirmed as positive also.

"The joint investigation undertaken by the Ministry of Health and
NZFSA into the current outbreak of salmonellosis due to a particular
strain suggests a food source," says Dr Greg Simmons, Chief Advisor
for the Ministry's Population Health Directorate. "The evidence is
not yet conclusive, but the results of the investigation to date
indicate that people with the infection (especially children) were
more likely to have eaten uncooked flour, for example in home-made
play dough, raw cake and batter mixes. As food is the probable source
of illness, the NZFSA will take the lead in any subsequent
investigation."

The following brands of flour could be affected: Champion, Edmonds,
Homelife and Pam's brand plain flours with best before dates between
June and July 2009.

NZFSA has informed the manufacturer of the finding. The manufacturer
has fully cooperated and acted responsibly and has implemented a
voluntary trade withdrawal. The source of the bacteria is not known,
and investigations are continuing, says Geoff Allen, NZFSA Director
(Compliance and Investigation).

"It is possible for low levels of bacteria to be on wheat or other
points of the flour milling process, and studies indicate that about
one percent of flour on average contains _Salmonella_," he added.
"Flour is a raw ingredient and intended to be consumed cooked.
Although flour is not expected to be a sterile product, we support
the company's precautionary decision to withdraw the product. The
affected batches of these brands can be safely used to cook if proper
care is taken. If people have used these brands in their baking, for
biscuits, cakes, breads or other Christmas treats, they can be
reassured that the cooking will have killed the bacteria and that
these home baked foods are safe to eat."

[In general, most cases of salmonellosis associated with flour are
related to the consumption of raw dough contaminated with salmonellae
from the uncooked egg in it. Baking will kill the organisms, but
baked goods can be contaminated by putting on an egg glaze afterwards
or through contaminated icing.
