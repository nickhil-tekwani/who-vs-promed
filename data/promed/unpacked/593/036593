A total of 4 persons reportedly died of malaria in Bhuvanahalli in
Hospet taluk [an administrative subdivision of a district] on Sunday
[17 Oct 2010].

District health officer Dr Srikanth Dasanur, who confirmed the deaths
in Bhuvanahalli, said that some people were suffering from fever in
Kotaginahal and Bhuvanahalli for some days. Unhygienic conditions and
contaminated water in rural areas is said to be the reason for the
deaths. He also said that a 16 member health team was camping in the
village and blood samples of around 290 persons have been sent for
testing.

[Malaria is common in north eastern Karnataka, and the recent WHO
World Malaria Report 2009 (latest) shows more than 100 cases per 1000
population in this area
(<http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2009/en/>). The
fatal cases here, presumed to be malaria, highlight that the area is
a high risk area for malaria.

Hospet (Kannada also called Hosapete, is a city in Bellary District
in northern Karnataka, India. It can be located on the
HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/0d*c>.
Hospet is on the Tungabhadra River, 12 km (7.5 mi) from Hampi, the
World Heritage site consisting of the ruins of the medieval city of
Vijayanagara, former capital of the Vijayanagar Empire
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospet>). - Mod.EP]

Cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria are on the rise in Adilabad
district, especially in tribal areas and slums.

As many as 310 cases out of a total 525 malaria positive cases were
detected in 237 550 tests conducted at PHCs [primary health centres]
level till now since January 2010 in the district.

Falciparum malaria is dangerous as it leads to cerebral malaria and
affects the brain. Children under the age of 15 years are the main
victims of the falciparum malaria.

[Adilabad is at the most northern tip of Andhra Pradesh and can be
located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/r/0d*M>.

Andhra Pradesh is regarded a low risk area in the WHO World Malaria
Report 2009 with 0-1 case per 1000 population per year. However,
malaria is found in neighboring states of Maharashtra and
Chhattisgarh (more than 100 cases per 1000 population per year) and
could be spreading into Andhra Pradesh. - Mod.EP]

The number of people dying from malaria in India has been hugely
underestimated, according to new research.

The data, published in the Lancet, suggests there are 13 times more
malaria deaths in India than the World Health Organization (WHO)
estimates.

The authors conclude that more than 200 000 deaths per year are
caused by malaria. The WHO said the estimate produced by this study
appears too high.

The research was funded by the US National Institutes of Health, the
Canadian Institute of Health Research, and the Li Ka Shing Knowledge
Institute.

The new figures raise doubts over the total number of malaria deaths worldwide.

Difficult diagnosis
-------------------
Calculating how many people die from malaria is extremely difficult.
Most cases that are diagnosed and treated do not result in
fatalities. People who die of extremely high fevers in the community
can be misdiagnosed and the cause of death can be attributed to other
diseases and vice versa.

As most deaths in India occur at home, without medical intervention,
cause of death is seldom medically certified. There are about 1.3
million deaths from infectious diseases, where acute fever is the
main symptom in rural areas in India.

In this study, trained field workers interviewed families, asking
them to describe how their relative died. 2 doctors then reviewed
each description and decided if the death was caused by malaria. This
method is called verbal autopsy.

Some 122 000 premature deaths between 2001 and 2003 were
investigated. The data suggests that 205 000 deaths before the age of
70, mainly in rural areas, are caused by malaria each year.

'Serious doubts'
----------------
The WHO estimated that malaria caused between 10 000-21 000 deaths in
India in 2006. The UN health agency welcomed new efforts to estimate
the number of malaria deaths. Dr Robert Newman, the director of its
global malaria programme, said: "It is vital to evaluate cause of
death correctly because different diseases require different
strategies for control." He concedes that WHO current evaluation
methods have their limitations, but has serious doubts about the high
estimates from this study.

Verbal autopsy, he said, was not a trustworthy method for counting
malaria deaths because the symptoms of malaria are shared with many
other common causes of acute fever. This, he said, along with what
the WHO called "implausibly high case incidence rates", indicates
that the findings of this study cannot be accepted without further
validation. He added that the WHO is working closely with the Indian
government in the fight against the disease.

Work needed
-----------
The authors say these figures, as well as global estimates, require
urgent revision. Professor Prabhat Jha, director of the Centre for
Global Health Research in Toronto, Canada, is one of the study's lead
authors.

He told BBC News: "Malaria kills not just children, but adults too in
surprisingly large numbers. India is the most populous country where
malaria is common, and it is a surprisingly common cause of death."

He added that there is a real need to reconsider how malaria deaths
are calculated and that similar analysis needs to be done in other
highly populated malaria endemic countries. There may also be
considerable under-reporting of malaria deaths in other highly
populated countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia.

The authors say that aggressive malaria control programmes are
needed, as well as scaling up treatment -- particularly in adult
rural populations.

ProMED-mail agrees with the statement of Dr Robert Newman cited
above, that verbal autopsy is not a reliable method to estimate
malaria mortality. Malaria causes unspecific symptoms and can
therefore easily be confused with many other febrile illnesses.

What is needed in India in proper, good quality diagnosis of malaria
in cases of febrile illness. In our 2nd report (above), 525 malaria
positive cases were detected in 237 550 blood films, which suggests
that at least in this area, malaria is rare. The question then arises
if the test results are correct and proper quality control and
assurance systems are need to ensure that. - Mod. EP]
