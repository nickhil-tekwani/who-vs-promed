[1] Infodemic impact
Date: Sun 11 Oct 2020

The confluence of misinformation and infectious disease isn't unique to COVID-19. Misinformation contributed to the spread of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, and it plagues efforts to educate the public on the importance of vaccinating against measles. But when it comes to COVID-19, the pandemic has come to be defined by a tsunami of persistent misinformation to the public on everything from the utility of masks and the efficacy of school closures, to the wisdom behind social distancing, and even the promise of untested remedies. According to a study published by the [US] National Bureau of Economic Research, areas of the country exposed to television programming that downplayed the severity of the pandemic saw greater numbers of cases and deaths -- because people didn't follow public health precautions.

In the United States, misinformation spread by elements of the media, by public leaders, and by individuals with large social media platforms has contributed to a disproportionately large share of COVID-19 burden: we house 4 percent of the global population but account for 22 percent of global COVID-19 deaths. With winter around the corner and people spending more time indoors, it is more imperative than ever that we counter misinformation and clearly communicate risks to the public; in addition, as we await the arrival of a vaccine, it is equally important to arm the public with facts. We have work to do: a recent poll found that just half of the American public plans to get a COVID-19 vaccine.

Below are some key recommendations for the science community, public health professionals, members of the public, and industry on what they can do to effectively blunt the effect of misinformation surrounding the COVID-19 response.

A coordinated campaign of influencers supporting science and public health
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A study of COVID-19 messaging on social media revealed misinformation from politicians, celebrities, and other prominent figures made up about 20 percent of claims but accounted for 69 percent of total social media engagement. Therefore, public health figures who have credibility must partner with social media influencers who have the reach. Harnessing the wide reach of local, regional, and national influencers from a wide swath of sectors both within and outside of the public health community is necessary to counter the large volume of misinformation thrust into the information ecosystem. A coordinated campaign of influencers that combines subject matter experts with entertainers, political figures, businesspeople, and civil society sectors will help to amplify consistent public health guidance across social media, digital, and traditional media outlets.

An aggressive and transparent effort by social media companies working in cooperation with governments to remove markedly false information regarding COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The single largest category of misleading or false claims (39 percent) are mischaracterizations or misleading messages about actions or policies of public authorities. Although social media companies are increasing their efforts to remove misinformation regarding COVID-19 from their platforms, their efforts are largely reactive and delayed, during which damaging information circulates among unwitting viewers. That's why public health officials must work with social media companies through robust partnerships in order to identify common sources of misinformation; proactively anticipate future misinformation from those sources; and enable its removal in a near real-time fashion. To be credible, this process must be robust, transparent, and nonpartisan.

Beyond debunking and removal of false information: a robust public messaging campaign that goes further than the government's traditional one-way message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Social media is popular because it provides individuals, groups, and institutions the opportunity to have dynamic conversations. However, public health messages from officials typically need to be cleared through a lengthy review process that does not allow officials to converse in real time with audiences in order to educate and debunk misinformation. To be more effective, public health officials should develop standards and guidance that allow them to dynamically interact with the public in a more timely fashion. Dynamic conversations and proactive messaging between public health officials and the public can be more impactful than removing false information from social media platforms, especially since removal typically occurs long after a significant number of individuals have already been exposed to the false message. A more promising approach is for public health officials and science- and health-based institutions to provide the public with a steady stream of facts.

Detect, understand, and expose COVID-19-related misinformation through data science and behavioral analytics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any effort aimed at conveying facts to large audiences requires harnessing and understanding audience data. This is what makes the advertisement industry so powerful. Unfortunately, our public health communicators have not adopted basic capabilities to which industry is accustomed. These capabilities include understanding the preferences of various sectors of the public active on social media platforms so as to deliver timely and salient information that resonate with them. These are capabilities routinely used by the ad industry, and they would serve the public health sector well in its effort to better understand audiences and in order to persuade them in favor of preferred behaviors.

Match public health promises with the capabilities of a government that can deliver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lessons from past public health mass media campaigns indicate that any advice from public health officials must be matched with the ability to deliver services to those audiences. For example, guidance for testing must be accompanied by readily accessible COVID-19 tests. Guidance for wearing masks must be met with ample availability of masks. And any education campaign on the efficacy of vaccines or therapeutics must be met with a sufficient availability and affordability of those measures.

Effectively countering the misinformation infodemic surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic will play a significant role in flattening the curve and ultimately defeating the virus. Lessons from communicable diseases highlight the fact that aggressive public health communications strategies are imperative in curbing disease. In the age of social media, the spread of misinformation provides a major hindrance to those efforts and requires an even more sophisticated response. The execution of the recommendations detailed above will help to effectively counter misinformation surrounding the current pandemic and help to protect us from the next one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Abstract
---------
"Media outlets often present diverging, even conflicting, perspectives on reality -- not only informing, but potentially misinforming audiences. We study the extent to which misinformation broadcast on mass media at the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic influenced health outcomes. We first document large differences in content between the 2 most popular cable news shows in the US, both on the same network, and in the adoption of preventative behaviors among viewers of these shows. Through both a selection-on-observables strategy and an instrumental variable approach, we find that areas with greater exposure to the show downplaying the threat of COVID-19 experienced a greater number of cases and deaths. We assess magnitudes through an epidemiological model highlighting the role of externalities and provide evidence that contemporaneous information exposure is a key underlying mechanism."

Globally the dangers of the infodemic have been recognized. The article above focuses on the USA, but similar infodemics have been permeating other countries, also with negative repercussions. WHO has recognized this and put together the 1st global infodemiology conference (https://www.who.int/news-room/events/detail/2020/06/30/default-calendar/1st-who-infodemiology-conference) and created an infodemiology management group (https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication/infodemic-management). See https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/23-09-2020-managing-the-covid-19-infodemic-promoting-healthy-behaviours-and-mitigating-the-harm-from-misinformation-and-disinformation for a joint statement by WHO, the UN, UNICEF, UNDP, UNESCO, UNAIDS, ITU, UN Global Pulse, and IFRC on Managing the COVID-19 infodemic: Promoting healthy behaviours and mitigating the harm from misinformation and disinformation.

We have seen the resurgence of measles in many countries in response to an infodemic from the antivaccination movement. And the impact on the West African Ebola epidemic due to misinformation. Now we are seeing the impact of misinformation during a global emergency -- the COVID-19 pandemic, with devastating results. - Mod.MPP]

[2] SARS-CoV-2 sequelae: "brain fog"

'Brain fog': the people struggling to think clearly months after COVID
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctors grapple for answers as more patients report post-coronavirus cognitive impairment

For [MN-M], COVID-19 brought an onslaught of symptoms from chest pains to an 11-day migraine, 3 positive test results, and a period in hospital. 7 months later, the rollercoaster is far from over: the 36-year-old from Byron Bay, Australia, is still experiencing symptoms -- including difficulties with thinking that are often described as "brain fog". "Brain fog seems like such an inferior description of what is actually going on. It's completely crippling. I am unable to think clearly enough to [do] anything," says [MN-M], adding that the experience would be better described as cognitive impairment.

The consequences, she says, have been enormous. "I can't work more than 1-2 hours a day and even just leaving the house to get some shopping can be a challenge," she says. "When I get tired it becomes much worse and sometimes all I can do is lay in bed and watch TV." Brain fog has made her forgetful to the point that she says she burns pots while cooking. "It often prevents me from being able to have a coherent conversation or write a text message or email," she adds. "I feel like a shadow of my former self. I am not living right now, I am simply existing." [She] is far from alone.

Dr Michael Zandi, a consultant at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, says he has seen patients who have been living with brain fog for a few months. While some have been admitted to hospital or intensive care with COVID, Zandi says he is now seeing cases among people who coped with COVID at home. "The proportion of people with cognitive symptoms for any period of time as a result of COVID-19 is unknown, and a focus of study now, but in some studies could be up to 20%," he says.

One difficulty in tackling "brain fog" is that the term itself is hazy. "It is not a medical term, this is what people are putting out there," says Dr Ross Paterson of the Queen Square institute. "We haven't defined what these symptoms are and whether they [are] anything measurable because, quite simply, nobody has done the study yet." Zandi agrees that difficulties with thinking and concentration have previously been reported by patients with other conditions, including the auto-immune disease lupus. "Doctors and scientists wouldn't necessarily use [brain fog] as a diagnosis as it doesn't exactly tell you what the problem is and what could be causing that," says Zandi.

Dr Wilfred Van Gorp, former president of the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology, says many COVID survivors he has seen with brain fog also have problems ranging from headaches to difficulties tolerating loud noise and controlling emotions. "The complaints are very much similar to [those of] post-concussion patients," he says, adding that there are also similarities to chronic fatigue syndrome.

Zandi says there could be many causes of brain fog in COVID survivors, from inflammation in the body to a lack of oxygen to the brain -- the latter is a particular concern for those who spent time on ventilators. Zandi adds that experiments in lab dishes have even suggested the virus can infect brain cells and choke off oxygen delivery to adjacent cells -- although that work has yet to be peer-reviewed.

And Paterson says that while studies are small, there is evidence from COVID patients hospitalised with severe neurological syndromes that the coronavirus can affect the nervous system, with concerns it could be causing problems such as neuro-inflammation and damage to the protective coating of nerve cells.

There could be psychological factors, too, particularly among COVID survivors who spent time in intensive care. "That is a very frightening thing to have gone through," says Zandi. Dr Nick Grey, a consultant clinical psychologist at Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said terms similar to "brain fog" have previously been used in connection with extreme tiredness, low mood and conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) -- the latter of which is thought to affect about a quarter of COVID survivors who were in intensive care.

And there is another possibility, says Paterson. "Are people who have been ill, locked away, more anxious, maybe not sleeping well -- are they just more prone to being in a migrainous state?" Grey stresses that both psychological and biological mechanisms could potentially be at play. "You are going to need quite careful studies to tease apart what is going on there," he says.

Scientists have already formed a partnership -- dubbed CoroNerve -- to explore the neurological and neuropsychiatric complications of COVID-19, while in other work Paterson and colleagues are looking at blood and spinal fluid collected from COVID patients who were hospitalised with neurological symptoms, those who had COVID without such problems, and healthy individuals. The aim of the new work, he says, is to explore whether even those without neurological symptoms show markers of neurological damage, and to what extent any processes are ongoing.

Van Gorp says that at present there is little research into brain fog, but suggests exercises to improve cognitive function may help, as might drugs such as the ADHD [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder] medication Ritalin. Others also say there is cause for hope. "What we don't know is how long it will go on for," says Zandi. "But we have seen patients who get better and are functioning."

[There have been no published papers on cognitive problems following infection with SARS-CoV-2, but a number of anecdotal reports have been in the news. For example, STAT reported on the problem in August 2020 (https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/12/after-covid19-mental-neurological-effects-smolder/). They reported "As many as 1 in 3 patients recovering from COVID-19 could experience neurological or psychological after-effects of their infections, experts told STAT, reflecting a growing consensus that the disease can have lasting impact on the brain. Beyond the fatigue felt by "long haulers" as they heal post-COVID, these neuropsychological problems range from headache, dizziness, and lingering loss of smell or taste to mood disorders and deeper cognitive impairment."

Victoria Pelak, professor of neurology and ophthalmology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and others are piecing the story together. So far the virus appears to cause its damage to the brain and nervous system not as much through direct infection as through the indirect effects of inflammation. Pieces of the virus, not actual viruses multiplying, can trigger an inflammatory response in the brain, said Lena Al-Harthi, chair of the Department of Microbial Pathogens and Immunity at Rush Medical College. "If you have an uncontrolled level of inflammation, that leads to toxicity and dysregulation," she said."

A scoping study was published examining neurologic manifestations of COVID, but in spite of their being numerous papers on acute neurologic problems, there were no peer reviewed publications on cognitive problems. The authors' conclude that research is needed on these long term neurologic sequelae.

"Abstract
---------
"Background: In the [coronavirus disease] 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the primary problem is respiratory-related, but there also is increasing evidence of central nervous system (CNS) involvement. This study aims to summarize the literature on neurological manifestations of COVID-19, underlying mechanisms of CNS involvement and cognitive consequences.

"Methods: A scoping review was conducted with multiple searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, and CINAHL databases. Full text articles in English were included if they involved humans with COVID-19. The search was updated twice, the latest on 19 May 2020.

"Results: After screening 266 records and cross referencing, 85 articles were included. The articles were case studies, opinion papers, letters to editors, and a few observational studies. No articles were found regarding cognitive consequences in COVID-19 patients. All reported on neurological manifestations and/or underlying mechanisms of CNS involvement in COVID-19.

"Conclusion: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 vary from mild (such as loss of taste and smell, dizziness, headache) to severe (such as ischemic stroke, encephalitis). Underlying pathways are suggested to be both indirect (as a result of thrombotic complication, inflammatory consequences, hypoxia, blood pressure dysregulation), and direct (neurotropic properties of the virus). Since most articles were opinion papers and no studies have been conducted on cognitive consequences, further research is warranted." - Mod.LK]

The Chinese city of Qingdao [Shandong province] is testing its entire population of 9 million people for COVID-19 over a period of 5 days. The mass testing comes after the discovery of a dozen cases linked to a hospital treating coronavirus patients arriving from abroad.

In May [2020], China tested the entire city of Wuhan -- home to 11 million people and the epicentre of the global pandemic. The country has largely brought the virus under control. That is in stark contrast to other parts of the world, where there are still high case numbers and lockdown restrictions of varying severity.

In a statement posted to Chinese social media site Weibo, Qingdao's Municipal Health Commission said 6 new cases and si6x asymptomatic cases had been discovered. All the cases were linked to the same hospital, said the state-run Global Times. The Chinese authorities now have a strategy of mass testing even when a new coronavirus cluster appears to be relatively minor, correspondents say.

The National Health Commission said on Monday [12 Oct 2020] that "the whole city will be tested within 5 days". Some 114 862 people -- including medical staff and newly hospitalised patients in the city's hospitals -- had already tested negative, Qingdao's health commission said.

Videos circulating online showed residents lining up late on Sunday [11 Oct 2020] to get tested, said the Global Times, adding that some of these test points were open from 07:00 to 23:00. The new cases come a week after China's Golden Week holiday -- which saw millions travel across the country. A Global Times report quoting the Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism said the coastal city had received 4.47 million passenger trips over this period.

The nearby city of Jinan, in the same province as Qingdao, called for anyone who had visited the city since [23 Sep 2020] to get tested, according to a report by The Paper. Earlier last month [September 2020], Qingdao announced that 2 port workers who handled imported seafood had tested positive. They were not known to have infected anyone else.

Daily coronavirus infections have fallen drastically in China, and for the most part the country appears to have recovered from the worst. China currently has 91 305 virus cases and the death toll stands at 4746, according to WHO data. [This includes Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan].

China said 11 million people in the city [Wuhan] had been tested in 10 days earlier this year [2020]. Hundreds of testing centres were opened, with thousands of staff involved. They also mobilised teams to test disabled people, the elderly and those vulnerable in their own homes. One of the ways they sped up the process was to use batch- or pool-testing. In this process, a batch of between 5 and 10 samples was tested. Only if a sample tested positive would the team go back to carry out individual tests to see who was positive within the batch.

[This is the 4th occurrence of local transmission reported in China following the interruption of transmission from the 1st wave back in December [2019] through March 2020. In this instance, it appears as though imported cases may have been a nidus for a possible nosocomial outbreak although this information is suggested by the wording of the report but not confirmed as yet. While the cases were announced in Qingdao on 11 Oct 2020, the cases were not announced on the official reports from the National Health Commission until today, 12 Oct 2020. (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/202010/400a3f95e1be4aa7b702ac45b96570f2.shtml)

Prior such events involved a Seafood Market enhanced outbreak in Beijing (363 cases); a market enhanced outbreak in Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region (832 cases), a seafood processing plant enhanced outbreak in Liaoning (100 cases). (See COVID-19 update (305): Spain seroprevalence, antigen test, WHO, global 20200707.7549897; COVID-19 update (347): Japan, countries, WHO, global 20200806.7651345; and COVID-19 update (361): tuberculosis, pandemics, selected countries, WHO, global 20200816.7683792).

We await further news on the epidemiology of this outbreak.

Qingdao is a major city in eastern Shandong province. A coastal city on the western shore of the Yellow Sea. According to Wikipedia, "Qingdao is a major nodal city on the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road arm of the Belt and Road Initiative that connects East Asia with Europe, and has the highest GDP of any city in the province." It is a major seaport with a naval base (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qingdao).

[4] WHO updates (as of 12 Oct 2020)
[A] Weekly summary
Date: Mon 12 Oct 2020

Global epidemiological situation
------------------------------
Since the last Weekly Epidemiological Update issued on [5 Oct 2020], over 2.2 million new cases and 39 000 deaths of COVID-19 have been reported across all 6 WHO regions. This is the highest number of reported cases so far in a single week. From [30 Dec 2020] through [11 Oct 2020], over 37 million COVID-19 cases and 1 million deaths have been reported globally. Nearly half of these cases (48%) and deaths (55%) continue to be reported in the Region of the Americas with the United States of America, Brazil and Argentina accounting for the greatest numbers of new cases and deaths in the region.

By WHO region, the European Region reported the greatest increase (34%) in cases in the past week while the African Region reported a substantial rise in deaths, with a 27% increase compared to the previous week. Within the African Region, South Africa continues to register more than half (56%, 690 896) of all reported confirmed cases.

For the 3rd week in a row, the South-East Asia Region reported a decline in new cases and deaths, 6% and 8% respectively, compared to the previous week. The decline is mainly due to decreases in reported cases in India and Bangladesh.

For the 2nd week in a row, the Regions of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacific reported increases in cases and deaths.

Overall, during the reporting period, all the Regions showed an increase in cases except the South East Asia Region.

Countries reporting the highest number of cases in the past 7 days include; India, the United States of America, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and France.

Figure 2: COVID-19 cases per million population reported in the last 7 days by countries, territories and areas, [5 Oct 2020] through [11 Oct 2020]

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
Although the Region had seen a slow but continuous decline in newly-reported cases since mid-July [2020], there were 11% more cases reported in the last 7 days compared to the prior week, reaching a total of over 1 200 000 cases (Figure 1, Figure 3). The current figures in the region represent 1% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 3% of deaths reported worldwide in the past week. The increase in the number of newly-confirmed cases is partially attributed to the higher number of countries reporting an increase in cases (21 countries), compared to the previous week (14 countries). Although there are a greater number of countries reporting increases, the pattern of increasing cases is driven by South Africa and Ethiopia, which continue to report the highest numbers of new cases in the last 7 days, followed by Kenya, Uganda, and Algeria. Continuing the trend from last week, the number of reported deaths increased this week with South Africa accounting for the majority of the new deaths in the Region (74%).

The current transmission pattern in the majority of the 47 Member States in the African Region is reported as community transmission (n=39, 83%), with 5 [countries] reporting clusters of cases, and only Seychelles, Mauritius, and Eritrea currently reporting sporadic cases.

South Sudan has reported a decrease in the number of newly-reported cases with an epidemiological link, with 29% in the past week, compared to 67% the week prior. This is attributed to a decrease in the proportion of cases that have been detected at a border crossing, where a history of travel can inform an epidemiological link.

This past week, Mozambique registered 795 new cases (25 per million population) bringing the total figure to almost 10 000 cases. Nevertheless, the country has registered a gradual decline over the last 3 weeks including a 39 and 40% decrease in new cases and deaths respectively in the past week, suggesting the epidemic may be slowing down in the country. While the number of tests per 1000 inhabitants has remained quite stable at 0.3 over the last 10 weeks, the test positivity rate has dropped this week to 9%. Schools have reopened with special measures to prevent further spread of the virus.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [11 Oct 2020]

- Region of the Americas
The Region of the Americas reported over 800 000 new cases in the last 7 days, a 6% increase in the number of new cases in the past week which is a bigger increase than the increase reported in the previous week. The United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Colombia registered the highest number of newly-reported cases. The Region also continues to account for a majority of all deaths reported globally in the past week (n=20 500, 52%). Mexico, the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia registered the highest number of new deaths.

This past week, the United States of America reported the largest increase in newly-reported cases since early August [2020], with over 327 000 cases reported. 10 of the 50 states reported the highest one-day increases in cases since their 1st reported case, including many in the Midwest and the Southwest, and 3 states reported their largest-ever one-day increase in new deaths.

The number of newly-reported cases has been increasing in Canada since mid-September [2020], with an increase of 26.7% cases and 14.3% deaths in the past week. Most of the cases and deaths were reported in Quebec and Ontario. Outbreaks in long-term care and retirement residences continue to account for most outbreaks in Canada to date. Since mid-July [2020], incidence rates in those 20 to 39 years of age have remained consistently higher than all other age groups. Since mid-September [2020], an increasing trend in the daily number of cases 20 to 39 years of age hospitalized has been observed.

Costa Rica, with the 2nd- highest incidence of cases per million population in the Region, has now reached over 86 000 cases and over 1000 deaths. During the last 5 weeks, the country had reached a plateau with comparable figures of reported cases and deaths. The country has reported over 107 COVID-19 hospitalizations per million inhabitants of which over a 3rd of them are in intensive care units.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [11 Oct 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
In the Eastern Mediterranean region, the weekly number of new cases and deaths have increased by 10% and 13% respectively in comparison to the previous week. The Islamic Republic of Iran is the worst affected country in the region, accounting for 20% of all new cases reported this week.

The number of new cases in Oman have more than doubled in the last week (from approximately 2 600 to over 5 500) amounting to an increase of more than 60%. This past week a 100 bed field hospital for COVID-19 patients along with an isolation center in the city of Sohar, the capital and largest city of the Al Batinah North Governorate, and another isolation ward in Sur Hospital in the South Sharqiyah region were opened to help mitigate the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

In Tunisia, there have been peak new cases (over 2 500) and deaths (over 40) also reported this week and the country plans to impose increased public health and safety measures including bans on gatherings, cutting public sector work hours and imposing curfews in an effort to interrupt transmission.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [11 Oct 2020]

- European Region
The Region registered the highest weekly incidence of COVID-19 cases since the beginning of the pandemic with almost 700 000 new cases reported. The weekly incidence in cases and deaths increased by 34% and 16% respectively in comparison to the previous week (Figure 6). The Region is the 2nd most active, contributing almost a 3rd (n=694 275, 31%) of new weekly cases reported globally. The United Kingdom, France, the Russian Federation and Spain account for over half of all new cases reported in the region (n= 355 455, 51%).

Latvia, Faroe Islands, and Iceland have reported the greatest percentage increase in new cases in the past week while a marked decrease was reported in Isle of Man, Malta and Spain. The majority of the countries in the region self-characterise their current transmission pattern as community transmission (n=30, 56%) or clusters of cases (n=20, 37%) with only Liechtenstein, Monaco, and the Holy See reporting sporadic transmission.

Spain, with over 50 000 cases reported in the past week, is showing a noticeable decline in the weekly incidence of cases and deaths of 24% and 19% respectively. In the past week, over 740 000 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic tests were carried out (16 tests per 1000 inhabitants per week). As of [8 Oct 2020], the bed occupancy in intensive care unit ranged between 7% and 39% across all regions. The incidence of cases and deaths in Poland increased this week by 93% and 104% respectively compared to the previous week, with almost 23 500 new cases and 370 deaths reported. Poland is tightening public health and social measures in response to these marked increases in an effort to avoid another lockdown. A coordination hospital will be created in each provide to manage the surge in COVID-19 patients.

- South East Asia Region
The gradual decline in incidence of cases and deaths in the South East Asia Region continued during the past week. The Region, nevertheless, remains among the most active, accounting for 25% of cases and 20% of deaths newly reported globally in the past 7 days (Figure 7).

The countries reporting the highest number of new cases in the South-East Asia Region continue to be India, Indonesia, and Nepal, while Sri Lanka and Bhutan are showing the highest increase in the proportion of new cases in the past week compared to the previous week. Across the ten countries in the region, only Myanmar and Nepal reported an increase in the number of new deaths in the past week compared to the previous week. The countries reporting the highest number of new deaths per million population are India and Myanmar, with 5 and 4 new deaths per million population respectively. In contrast to the other regions with currently high case incidence, most of the 10 Member States in the South-East Asian Region self-report their current transmission pattern as either clusters of cases (n=6) or sporadic cases (n=2), with only Bangladesh and Indonesia currently reporting community transmission.

Sri Lanka reported over 1200 new confirmed cases in the past epidemiological week, a substantial increase compared to the 46 cases confirmed the previous reporting week. In a recent development, a large cluster of cases (831 cases as on 7 Oct 2020) was reported in an apparel manufacturing factory in Gamphana district about 50 km [31 mi] from Colombo. The exact epidemiological link is currently under investigation.

The reported number of cases increased rapidly in Nepal in the past week, with over 21 000 new cases and 86 new deaths reported. Although the test positivity rate has raised from 5 to 15% in just 8 weeks, there has also been an expansion in testing activity, which is currently around 3 samples tested / 1000 persons per week.

- Western Pacific Region
The Western Pacific region accounts for the least number of reported cases globally this week, however the region has experienced an increase of 6% in newly-reported cases and a 26% increase in reported deaths in the past 7 days.

New cases in the Philippines have stabilized over the past 3 weeks with around 18 000 cases reported weekly, lower than the peak of around 30 000 weekly new cases in early to mid-August [2020] however it does continue to account for the greatest number of new cases in the region. Reports suggest clustering of cases has occurred in several workplaces in Davao Region following the easing of lockdown restrictions under the modified general community quarantine and reopening of the economy measures, with most of the clusters reported in 12 establishments. As of [12 Oct 2020], the total number of cases in Davao Region is 3743 with 686 cases reported in the past 2 weeks and Davao City (the capital) contributing 65% of the total cases in the region. There are also reports of near capacity utilization of ICU and ward beds, in the major hospital in the region last week.

In French Polynesia, there were peak new cases this week, a 62% increase from last week, with reports suggesting most cases were detected from the main island of Tahiti, with cases spreading to adjacent islands of Moorea and even reaching several outer islands, including Raivavae, Arutua, and Nuku Hiva. Deaths in French Polynesia remain low and have not increased in the past week. The positivity rate of COVID-19 tests is currently high, at 26.3%, however only symptomatic persons are being tested.

[The weekend reporting artifact is somewhat present today with countries such as Brazil and Kazakhstan having marked reductions in their 24 hour newly confirmed cases, and no cases reported from Sweden. That being said, in the past 3 days another 1 million newly confirmed cases have been reported, bringing the total number of reported cases to 38 035 470. India and the USA are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India in the 2nd position in terms of cumulative case counts and dominating in terms of newly reported cases. In the past 24 hours, these 2 countries -- India (54 265), followed by the USA (45 791) -- have maintained their dominance. A global total of 3927 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (11-12 Oct 2020), also representing a marked reduction.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include India, USA, Spain (27 856), UK (13 972), Russia (13 592), Argentina (9524), France (8505), Brazil (8429), Colombia (7767), Netherlands (6845), and Belgium (5327). A total of 38 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 17 of the 38 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 8 were from the Americas region, and 7 were from the Eastern Mediterranean region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 0.42%.

Impression: Global 7-day averages continue to increase, in spite of the weekend artifact lowering the 24-hour changes. - Mod.MPP]
