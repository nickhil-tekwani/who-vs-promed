The caribou herd on Southampton Island [Nunavut], which was wiped out in the 1950s, [then repopulated] may face extinction once again.

Mitch Campbell, a wildlife biologist with the Government of Nunavut, says disease and overhunting are threatening the herd on the island at the mouth of Hudson Bay. He said a reproductive disease called brucellosis infected the island herd in 2000 and as a result, pregnancy rates have dropped to about 30 per cent from 80 per cent.

Now social media like Facebook and cheap shipping rates from the airlines for country food are helping people in communities like Iqaluit where caribou is scarce, order meat from Coral Harbour hunters, putting more stress on the herd.

The herd on Southampton Island was hunted to extinction in the 1950s, and was re-established when 50 animals were transplanted there in 1968.

"They've gone down from a high of 30 000 in 1997 to what we surveyed this last June [2011] which was about 7500 animals," said Campbell.

Campbell said more than 1500 caribou had been exported this winter [2011-2012], which is higher than the birth rate, and that is only halfway through the season.

"We believe that if this isn't stopped, this is an unsustainable harvest and probably will cause the population to be devastated within the next 3 years or so," he said. "One of the only ways that we will be able to control the harvest is by applying a total allowable harvest."

Campbell said efforts to meet with the Coral Harbour Hunters and Trappers Organization have been unsuccessful.

No one from the organization was available to speak with CBC.

[In cattle, bison, and buffalo, and in all caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_, a cervid), brucellosis is mainly caused by _Brucella abortus_, a Gram negative coccobacillus or short rod. This organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Up to 9 _B. abortus_ biovars (1-9) have been reported, but some of these biovars differ only slightly and their status is unresolved. Other _Brucella_ species uncommonly associated with disease in cattle include _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_. (For information on _B. suis_ or _B. melitensis_, see the fact sheets titled "Porcine Brucellosis" (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_suis.pdf and "Ovine and Caprine Brucellosis," http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf, respectively.)

In animals, _B. abortus_ is usually transmitted by contact with the placenta, fetus, fetal fluids, and vaginal discharges from infected animals. Animals are infectious after either abortion or full-term parturition. _B. abortus_ may also be found in the milk, urine, semen, feces, and hygroma fluids. Shedding in milk can be prolonged or lifelong, and may be intermittent. Many infected cattle become chronic carriers.

Infection usually occurs by ingestion and through mucous membranes, but _B. abortus_ can be transmitted through broken skin. Although the mammary gland is usually colonized during the course of an infection, it can also be infected by direct contact, with subsequent shedding of the organisms in the milk. In utero infections also occur. Venereal transmission seems to be uncommon. Transmission by artificial insemination is reported to occur when contaminated semen is deposited in the uterus but not in the midcervix. _B. abortus_ can be spread on fomites including feed and water. In conditions of high humidity, low temperatures, and no sunlight, these organisms can remain viable for several months in water, aborted fetuses, manure, wool, hay, equipment and clothes. _Brucella_ species can withstand drying, particularly when organic material is present and can survive in dust and soil. Survival is longer when the temperature is low, particularly when it is below freezing.

In cattle, abortions and stillbirths usually occur 2 weeks to 5 months after infection. Reproductive losses typically occur during the 2nd half of gestation; thus, the incubation period is longer when animals are infected early in gestation.

In cattle, _B. abortus_ causes abortions and stillbirths; abortions usually occur during the 2nd half of gestation. The abortion rate may be as high as 80 percent. Some calves are born alive but weak, and may die soon after birth. The placenta may be retained and secondary metritis can occur. Lactation may be decreased. After the 1st abortion, subsequent pregnancies are generally normal; however, cows may shed the organism in milk and uterine discharges. Epididymitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, or testicular abscesses are sometimes seen in bulls. Infertility occurs occasionally in both sexes, due to metritis or orchitis/epididymitis. Hygromas, particularly on the leg joints, are a common symptom in some tropical countries. Arthritis can develop in some long-term infections. Systemic signs do not usually occur in uncomplicated infections, and deaths are rare except in the fetus or newborn. Infections in nonpregnant females are usually asymptomatic.

This article does not tell us how the disease was diagnosed, but presumably it was from tissues of an aborted fetus.

This disease does have the potential to cause great harm to this herd. The harvesting pressure and the disease are a disastrous combination for these animals. Controlling the harvesting or stopping the harvesting is one way to decrease pressure on the herd, especially while disease control measures are implemented.
