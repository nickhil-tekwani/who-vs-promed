The following background information on enteroviral infection in Japan was
abstracted from GIDEON <http://www.cyinfo.com>:
Hand-foot-and-mouth disease [HFMD has been described in Japan since the
late 1960's. Most outbreaks occur during summer, with 50% of patients below
age 2 years.
Coxsackievirus A 16 accounted for 55.5% of HFMD cases during 1995 to 1997;
enterovirus 71 for 22.8%; Coxsackie A 10 for 21.7%.
A large nationwide epidemic was registered in 1995. A smaller epidemic was
reported in Osaka in 1997 - including 3 fatal cases of enterovirus 71
infection.
832 872 cases of HFMD were reported during 1982 to 1991; 56 896 in 1992; 92
504 in 1993; 54 827 in 1994; 158 677 in 1995; 24 545 in 1996; 75 041 in 1997.
