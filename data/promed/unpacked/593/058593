GK Banks, J Colvin, RV Chowda Reddy, MN Maruthi, V Muniyappa, HM Venkatesh,
et al. First Report of the Bemisia tabaci B biotype in India and an
associated tomato leaf curl virus disease epidemic. Plant Dis 2001; 85:
231, published online as D-2000-1218-01N, 2000.
In May 1999, in the Kolar district of Karnataka State, [the number of
whiteflies, _Bemisia tabaci_ on tomato increased by [about 1000 times
that observed previously (3). This was associated with an epidemic of
severe tomato leaf curl disease that caused complete crop failure.
DNAs extracted from 35 symptomatic tomato leaf samples collected within the
epidemic region all gave the expected 500 to 600 bp amplicon with
begomovirus-specific primers A/B (1). These primers amplify from the
conserved nonanucleotide TAATATTAC in the common region of DNA-A to the
conserved amino acid sequence CEGPCKYG within the coat protein gene. AluI
and TaqI restriction patterns of all 35 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
products were identical.
One PCR product from an epidemic (GenBank no. AF321929) and a non-epidemic
(AF321930) site (Bangalore) were cloned and sequenced. The two 531-bp
inserts showed 96% nucleotide identity to each other and 94% nucleotide
identity to the equivalent region of [the Bangalore isolate of Tomato leaf
curl virus (ToLCBV-Ban-4) (AF165098), suggesting that the epidemic was
caused by an indigenous ToLCBV strain. Adult _B. tabaci_ were collected
from tomato plants at nine sites within the epidemic. DNA was extracted
from 9 to 13 individuals per site and analyzed by RAPD-PCR using primers
OpB20 and OpB11.
Eighty to 100 per cent of individuals per site had identical patterns to
those of B biotype individuals from Israel and Florida, which were
different to the patterns produced by the indigenous Indian [whitefly.
Adult _B. tabaci_ from the epidemic and nonepidemic (Bangalore) regions
were cultured separately on [20 zucchini plants vars. Fordhook and
Ambassador.
Distinct silverleaf symptoms appeared in all plants fed on by the epidemic
_B. tabaci_, but not on those fed on by the nonepidemic whiteflies.
Irregular ripening of tomatoes was also a widespread problem in the
epidemic area. Cytochrome oxidase I (COI) (720 bp) gene sequences were
obtained for epidemic (AF321927) and on epidemic (AF321928) B. tabaci,
which had only 80 per cent nucleotide identity to each other. A GenBank
BLAST search showed that the former were most similar to B biotype whitefly
from Israel (AF164667; 97%) and Texas (AF164675; 99%).
The B biotype transmits Indian ToLCBV (2) and its introduction into India
is of great concern as it is already associated with a devastating plant
disease epidemic.

[The identity of tomato leaf curl virus requires comment. According to the
latest rules of nomenclature adopted by the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses published in 1999, the proper name for the virus is
tomato leaf curl begomovirus (ToLCV). There are at least 2 isolates
(strains?) of the virus from Bangalore, I and II. In addition to the
Bangalore isolates, there are others from Australia, India (New Delhi),
Senegal, Taiwan, and Tanzania. I have no information on possible
relationships between ToLCV and other begomoviruses.
Do any of our subscribers have such information? Comparison of sequences
and biological features of ToLCV-India with other geminiviruses showed that
ToLCV-India is a distinct virus and is related to whitefly-transmitted
geminiviruses from the Old World. ToLCV-India has been associated with
watermelon leaf curl disease in Pakistan. Useful references include the
