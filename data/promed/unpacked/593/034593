----------------------------------------------------------------------
The American traveler reported to ProMED on May 9, 2018 to have acquired _P. falciparum_ malaria during travel to Costa Rica has been determined to have not been infected with malaria.

Although rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) performed at the hospital and PCR testing performed at the state health department were positive for _P. falciparum_, further testing by CDC on the specimen using multiple tests (antigen, PCR, and serology) has been negative, indicating that the initial positive results were false positives.

CDC has rescinded the malaria notice posted on [10 May 2018] that recommended chemoprophylaxis for travelers to the Osa Peninsula area of Puntarenas Province in Costa Rica.

No chemoprophylaxis is recommended for travelers to Costa Rica at this time. The rescind notice is posted at https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/new_info/2018/Costa_Rica_5_22_2018.html

[ProMED thanks Henry Wu and the GeoSentinel team for the prompt communication, that the case was misdiagnosed as malaria. If malaria microscopy had been done the false diagnosis could probably have been avoided. The microscopy of a Giemsa stained thick blood film is more sensitive than a rapid diagnostic test and would have been negative. - Mod.EP
