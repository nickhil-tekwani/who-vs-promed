[This kind of follow-up report is essential to the development of global
disease communication on the Internet. They add a level of completeness
and comprehensiveness that the initial outbreak reports are inherently
lacking. - Mod. pc]
The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has hit about one million swine in Taiwan
over the past (approximately) two months.
I extracted and translated for outbreaking FMD in Taiwan from Japanese web
site
<http://ss.niah.affrc.go.jp/FMD/index.html> as following table.
