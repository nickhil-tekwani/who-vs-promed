Cases of legionnaires' disease in the UK and Sweden linked with a
London site
----------------------------------------------------
There have been 3 confirmed cases of legionnaires' disease associated
with central London, in particular the area of Portman Square. The
cases are all men aged between 31 and 61 years; illness onsets were 22
May, 25 May, and 3 Jun [2001]. While 2 cases had worked in the area,
the third case was reported to the PHLS Communicable Disease
Surveillance Centre (CDSC) by the Swedish collaborator in the European
Surveillance Scheme for Travel Associated Legionnaires' Disease (1).
This case had visited London and been in the Portman Square area
before the onset of his illness. All cases were diagnosed in their
admitting hospital by urinary antigen detection.
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 infection has been confirmed in
the 2 British cases by the Respiratory and Systemic Infection
Laboratory at the PHLS Central Public Health Laboratory.
An outbreak control team has been convened and possible environmental
sources of infection within a 500 metre radius of Portman Square are
being investigated. _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has been identified
in water systems and cooling towers in 3 buildings in the vicinity.
Control measures have been taken at all 3 sites and further
investigations are in hand.
All Consultants for Communicable Disease Control in England and Wales
have been alerted to the outbreak. Information has been disseminated
in Europe through the European Surveillance Scheme for Travel
Associated Legionnaires' Disease and in the United States via the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDSC would be
grateful for information on any other suspected cases of legionnaires'
disease who became ill during May or June that might be associated
with this incident. Please contact Carol Joseph, European legionella
surveillance scheme project co-ordinator (tel: 0208 200 6868 ext 4497;
email cjoseph@phls.org.uk).

legionnaires' disease can be obtained from its website:
