As the autumn truffle-hunting season gets under way in Italy, Tuscany and
the Marches have been hit by a spate of dog poisonings, apparently the
result of a vendetta involving rival truffle hunters competing in an
increasingly lucrative market.

Dogs such as pointers and setters are traditionally used to sniff out white
and black truffles, which grow underground in wooded areas. A truffle
dealer in Milan said the scarce and high-priced delicacy was "a status
symbol", like caviare or Havana cigars. "The scarcer and more desirable
they get, the more things can turn nasty."

The dog murders have occurred in the Tuscan countryside near Arezzo and on
the border with the Marches. Earlier this year Dame Muriel Spark, the
writer, who lives in Tuscany, said the "truffle war" was becoming vicious
and protested a number of her own dogs had died after eating poisoned bait.
"To have to stand by helpless while an animal dies in agony from strychnine
or some rat-exterminating cocktail is hell," she said.

Tuscan police said they were investigating more than 200 recent cases of
dog poisoning in the Mugello and Val di Sieve areas alone. La Repubblica
said the latest victim was a pointer whose owner, a local plumber with a
passion for truffles, found it near death near the village of Sestino in
the Apennines. He carried the dog for half a mile to the local veterinarian
who managed to save the dog*s life.

Twelve other truffle dogs in the same area have died over the past 3 weeks.
Farmers said the favored poisoned bait consisted of mortadella sausage meat
laced with strychnine and weedkiller, thrown beside paths and beneath
bushes in the local woods which are described as "a goldmine of truffles
and mushrooms". Police said prices were "sky high", with truffles selling
for up to UKL2,000 a kilogram (2.2lb).
In the provinces of Florence and Prato, one veterinarian said 50 poisoned
dogs were being treated a week, just weeks after the white truffle hunting
season had begun. Most of the poisonings are centered on a small village in
Tuscany; last weekend, a 4-year-old pointer named Lella became the
village's 13th victim
Farmers near Arezzo said dogs trained to sniff out the delicacies from the
soil were worth between UKL3000 and UKL4000 each, and were not easy to
replace.

[Strychnine produces a painful death. A dog ingesting strychnine presents
with no vomiting or diarrhea. The initial clinical signs are a restless,
anxious dog, that is described as *walking on egg shells* with increased
respirations, not quite panting. This progress to constant panting, muscle
tremors. Finally tetanic seizures or convulsions that occur spontaneously
or with touch, light, or noise stimuli. The limbs extend, the head is
curved upwards and backwards and the lips are pulled back in what has been
termed a sardonic grin.
The severity and duration of convulsions are not prognostic. Death is
generally from asphyxia due to prolonged paralysis of the respiratory
muscles. When the dog is in seizures, the muscles of the diaphragm are
paralyzed and the dog cannot breath. Death may be as sudden as 5 to 10
minutes or as long as 2 hours.
Animals poisoned with strychnine can be successfully treated. If the animal
was seen ingesting a known bait, and is not showing signs the veterinarian
should induce emesis (vomiting).
Animals showing clinical signs should have the convulsions controlled and
respiratory support initiated. Pentobarbital sodium is the drug of choice,
administered to effect. (Phenobarbital is not as effective due to the long
period of time before it takes effect.)
It may be necessary to perform gastric lavage to decrease adsorption of any
strychnine remaining in the stomach. The veterinarian should then
administer activated charcoal. The charcoal should be removed from the
stomach by sedating the animal and flushing the stomach or by
administration of a saline cathartic. Forced diuresis with acidification of
the urine is appropriate.
An anesthetic machine may utilized to support respiration for an extended
period of time, however, this removes it from use in surgeries. A
respirator is better, if available. Use of central acting skeletal muscle
relaxants such as glyceryl guaiacolate and/or methocarbamol are
recommended, but require frequent redosing. The animal will need to have
its temperature maintained by use of blankets and placed in a dark quite
room. Turn the animal periodically to prevent hypostatic congestion. The
continued administration of activated charcoal may prevent the convulsions
which re-occur 1-3 days after apparent recovery.
Strychnine is an ugly way for an animal to die, but these animals can be
saved by proper and timely assistance.
Anticoagulant rat-exterminating poisons can also be successfully treated
with prolonged administration of vitamin K under a veterinarian care and
recommendations. - Mod.TG]
