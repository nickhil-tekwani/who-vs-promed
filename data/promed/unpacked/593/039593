The German government moved to contain rising panic over Foot and Mouth
Disease (FMD) last night after 2 farms were sealed off when sheep imported
from Britain were found to have been exposed to it. The discovery came with
the nation still reeling from its first cases of mad cow disease (BSE,
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) just 3 months ago.
Renate Kunast, the agriculture minister, said preliminary tests on
slaughtered animals had proved negative. A final round of tests was
underway last night with the results expected today. Ms Kunast said "We
believe the suspicious cases will be proved negative."
Fears the German agriculture was facing another disaster that could spread
across mainland Europe rose after antibodies were found in 5 sheep among a
large consignment had been imported from Britain and slaughtered as a
precaution.
While the presence of antibodies did not mean the animals were suffering
from the disease, the discovery led experts to conclude the sheep had been
exposed to FMD and were, therefore, "high risk".
Vets immediately placed under quarantine an area within a radius of 2 miles
of the 2 farms, in the western province of North Rhine-Westphalia, as
politicians prepared the nation for the worst.
More than 700 British sheep and 1000 pigs have been imported into North
Rhine-Westphalia in the past month.
