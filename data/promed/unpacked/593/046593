Two cases of equine virus confirmed
-----------------------------------
The Western Tidewater Health District [Virginia] on Monday [10 Aug 2009]
received confirmation of positive tests for eastern equine encephalitis
[EEE] in 2 horses that lived near Route 13.

The deadly virus is transmitted by mosquito bites. The city has seen
increased virus activity this year [2009], with 7 sentinel chickens and 50
mosquito pools testing positive for the disease.

Equine veterinarian John Sangenario said last month [July 2009] that
Dominion Equine Clinic in Suffolk had seen 5 cases of the disease in
Suffolk horses. City spokeswoman Debbie George said she didn't know why the
confirmed number differed from what Sangenario reported.

Signs of the virus in horses include staggering, circling, depression, and
sometimes fever and blindness. It can be prevented in horses by
vaccination, but there is no cure.

There is no vaccine against the disease for humans, but Suffolk residents
can protect themselves by following these steps, according to the health
district:

- use mosquito repellent; 3 active ingredients, for application directly to
human skin, are recommended for use as repellents: DEET, picaridin, and oil
of lemon eucalyptus. Use products containing no greater than 30 per cent
DEET on children. For adults, higher concentrations of DEET (up to 50 per
cent) give the longest period of protection
- wear long sleeves and pants
- avoid the outdoors from dusk to dawn, when mosquitoes are most active
- eliminate standing water outside where mosquitoes can breed, such as
empty containers, bottles, and cans; clean gutters and bird baths; remove
discarded appliances; cover boats so they and the covering do not hold
water; remove old automobile tires; and trim vegetation that provides
mosquito hiding places.

Symptoms of the disease in humans can include headache, fever, loss of
appetite, aching muscles, tiredness, encephalitis, and coma. The disease
may kill up to 35 per cent of people who develop encephalitis, making it
considerably more deadly to humans than West Nile Virus, according to the
health department.

Horse owners are reminded to ensure their horses' vaccinations are up to
date, the health department added.

In Chesapeake, a goat has been diagnosed with a suspected case of eastern
equine encephalitis -- a rarity, according to the Virginia Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services [VDACS]. "It is unusual to see EEE in a
goat," said Dr Joseph Garvin, VDACS' director of laboratory services, "and
that may indicate a very high level of EEE virus in the environment."

Agriculture and Consumer Services' website at <http://www.vdh.virginia.gov>
or call the health district at 514-4767.

More EEE cases in Chesapeake, Suffolk. Detected in 2nd horse and a goat
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Hampton Roads horse and a goat have tested positive for eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE).

The Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (VDACS) said
the horse, a 4 year old miniature mare from Suffolk, became ill on [27 Jul
2009] and was put down the following day because she was severely sick. The
Animal Health Laboratory in Ivor confirmed the horse had EEE and had not
been vaccinated for the disease. This is the 2nd case of EEE in horses this
year [2009]. The 1st was a horse from Chesapeake.

It is unusual to see EEE in a goat, said VDACS Dr Joseph Garvin. But that
appears to be the case in Chesapeake, where a 7 year old doe tested positive.

The VDACS is waiting on test results on an emu from Chesapeake.

The Virginia Department of Health reported that, to date, 101 mosquito
pools in the Tidewater area have tested positive for EEE, as well as 30
sentinel chickens. That could indicate that we are on track for one of our
heaviest EEE years since Virginia began testing mosquitoes for EEE in 1998.
This increases the risk of EEE transmission to people, particularly in the
coastal regions of Virginia. Therefore, persons should minimize their
exposure to mosquitoes.

VDACS advises horse owners to vaccinate their horses every 6 to 12 months
against EEE. This is particularly important in the Southeastern region of
Virginia, where many veterinarians recommend the 6 month vaccination
interval. Vaccination includes an initial shot, with a booster 3 to 6 weeks
later, then boosters every 6 to 12 months. Vaccinations must be
administered correctly and in a timely fashion to be effective. There is no
vaccine for goats or emus.

For more information on EEE in animals, consumers should contact the Office
of the State Veterinarian at 804.692.0601 or consult their local veterinarians.

[The eastern coast of the US has had an abundance of rain this year (2009).
While rain is appreciated for crops, it also provides for a crop of
mosquitoes. Clearly vaccination is paramount for horses. I am unsure if
there are vaccines for goats. However the equine vaccine has been reported
to work in emus. - Mod.TG
