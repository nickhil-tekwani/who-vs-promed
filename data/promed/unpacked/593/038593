State Epidemiologist Brenda Rivera confirmed this morning a death associated with the bacterium _Acinetobacter baumannii_ in the intensive care unit of the UPR [University of Puerto Rico] Hospital in Carolina, which had already reported an outbreak of infection by the same bacterium in 2013.

"There was an outbreak. In early May [2015], [hospital staff] quickly identified an infected person and 3 others who were colonized. They quickly notified us by telephone and the next day they submitted the official report," she said in a radio interview with Noti Uno 630.

According to Rivera, the outbreak is controlled, "and it is over"; so far no additional reports have been submitted. "Our investigation indicates that [a person whose health was severely compromised] died, not necessarily [as a result of infection with] _A. baumannii_," she added. According to the expert, "it is very hard to determine the exact cause of death; the infection may have been a contributing factor, but it is very hard to ascertain to what extent." Nonetheless, she confirmed that the person who died was infected and had contracted the bacteria in that hospital.

[The news report above fails to state if the clinical isolate from the case of fatal nosocomial _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB) infection and the 3 AB isolates from colonized patients were genotyped and if the clinical isolates proved to have identical genotypes. Also, it would be important to know if environmental sampling were done, and if genotypes of any environmental AB isolates matched that of the clinical isolates. Some patients may become asymptomatic carriers of AB and contribute to continued transmission of this organism if not identified and also placed in isolation. We are not told if there are any epidemiologic linkages among the 4 hospitalized patients (e.g., located in the same hospital units, undergoing the same procedures, cared for by the same healthcare team, etc.); nor are we told if the isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR-AB). More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be greatly appreciated.

AB is a Gram-negative coccobacillus. Nosocomial strains are characteristically MDR. Some isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins (such as colistin), sulbactam (1), and tigecycline; although resistance to these antibiotics has been reported. (Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down the antibiotic ampicillin and preventing it from working. However, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial properties against AB.)

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-AB have involved restriction of antibiotic use in general and enhanced infection control interventions (1) that involve placement of patients colonized or infected with MDR-AB on contact precautions, cohorting, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys to look for other cases of MDR-AB and active-surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to persons from whom MDR-AB have been recovered (2,3).
