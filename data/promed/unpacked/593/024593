Anthrax letters, 2001 - USA: Bruce Ivins, RIP
------------------------------------------------
It was on 9 Oct 2001 that the last of the anthrax letters were mailed to US Senators Tom Daschle and Patrick Leahy. Latterly the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has modified that Bruce Ivins was the perpetrator. They now claim that he was merely the mailer of the spore-filled letters. This is not logical.

Absence of proof that Ivins could have mailed the letters:
- The FBI has assumed that Bruce, because of his fixation with the Princeton, NJ sorority, had driven there from Frederick, MD to mail the letters, and back to Frederick. However, there is a total absence of any proof of such a 7-hour drive of some 392 miles. For each trip, it would have necessitated at least 2 visits to a gas station, with one certainly on the days of the 3 assumed mailings. There is no evidence of gas purchases, toll records, or toll security-camera images of his car on the road to and from Princeton. Nor is there any FBI 302 evidence of his family noting his extended absences.

- The 4 New York letters had an 18 Sep 2001 postmark. Bruce had taken leave on the morning of 17 Sep 2001 to deal with a worrying family issue concerning his daughter; she was suffering from acute stress and depression. In the afternoon, Bruce had a 4 pm meeting at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). As the date switch on the emptying of mailboxes is 12:30 pm, if he drove up to Princeton on 17 Sep, he would have had to mail the letters there after 12:30 pm, and then scoot back for his meeting on a 3.5-hour drive. If he had gotten to Princeton earlier, having left Frederick at 8:30 am and ignoring his daughter's health, they would have been date stamped 17 Sep. If he had headed north after dinner, he would have been in no state the next morning [18 Sep] at 7 am to pick up a Fort Detrick, MD pool car and collect a sample of his new Protective Antigen for a proposed new vaccine, be joined by 2 USAMRIID colleagues, and then drive to a 10 am Covance meeting in Denver, PA, a trip of some 119 miles, in 2 hours. They returned late that afternoon, and all the while Bruce was his normal cheerful self (Rick Lambert, pers. comm., 14 Jun 2018). Logic says Bruce did not make the drive to Princeton. There was nothing magical about 18 Sep; the mailing date was irrelevant except in retrospect.

FBI's claim of "consciousness of guilt":
The descriptions of Bruce Ivins during interviews clearly describe a man under extreme stress: (1) In retrospect, he was undergoing a mental breakdown starting in 2000 that progressively got worse; (2) his marriage was breaking up; (3) he was publicly humiliated; (4) he was barred from his laboratory; (5) his friends were instructed not to speak to him; (6) he was USD 70 000 out of pocket for legal fees; (7) a key part of the evidence was that the letter spores genetically matched his RMR-1029 flask culture, which could not have made any sense to him if true; and (8) he was told he was going to be indicted for capital murder. He died of suicide on 29 Jul 2008. He had constantly protested his innocence. The FBI fixated on him, probably for lack of any other hypotheses. They totally forgot that if you are presented with "evidence" that ties you to something, which you did not do but cannot perceive any alternative, your psyche would take a beating. Just as Bruce found when they claimed that the spores had been grown from flask RMR-1029, but he had not done it, as the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) later proved. The "consciousness of guilt" concept amounts to no more than circumstantial evidence. It may possibly be introduced in court to show a pattern of suspicious behavior, but it is not conclusive. And, as in this instance, there can be valid alternative explanations.

Therefore, we can safely assume that Bruce was in no way involved in the preparation and mailing of those anthrax spore-filled letters in 2001.

The initial claim by the FBI that Bruce was the perpetrator arose from the fact of the early matching genetic similarity of the letter spores and the contents of the RMR-1029 flask in Bruce's laboratory. This ignored the fact that 16 government laboratories had access to the same_ Bacillus anthracis_ used in the letters.

For proof that the letter contents did not originate from the RMR-1029 flask in Ivins' lab, see Table 3, p. 27, and Figure 8, p. 64 of the December 2014 GAO report Anthrax: Agency Approaches to Validation and Statistical Analyses Could be Improved (https://www.gao.gov/assets/670/667671.pdf). Replicate tests of undiluted samples from RMR-1029 showed 17 of 30 (57% positive) positive for mutant A1, 29 of 30 (97% positive) for mutant A3, 23 of 30 (77% positive) for mutant D1, 24 of 30 (80% positive) for mutant D2, and 30 of 30 (100% positive) for mutant E. Thus, the chance of a sample being positive for all 5 mutants is only 34%. When these results are matched with those of letter spores, the latter were 100% positive for mutants A1, A3, D1, and D2 but only 23 of 30 (77% positive) of the letter replicates were positive for E. How come all the flask replicates had E but only 23 of 30 of the letter spore replicates? Clearly, they had separate origins and RMR-1029 was not the source for the letter spores.

Many have pointed out the importance of the _B. subtilis_ contaminant, which was and is genetically unique and therefore has the capacity to be an institutional forensic fingerprint. The _B. subtilis_ contaminant was a unique strain found only in the New York Post and Tom Brokaw letters and from an environmental swab at American Media, Inc. (AMI) -- clearly, an institutional fingerprint but not adequately chased up. The FBI extensive search for the _B. subtilis_ was limited apparently only to USAMRIID and not found. It has a reputation of lurking in inadequately cleaned and disinfected fermenters. The fermenter at Fort Detrick was out of commission and had been for a number of years. _B. licheniformis_ was also found in the New York Post letter. Perry Mikesell and Bruce Ivins in their discovery of the anthrax plasmids and virulence used _B. subtilis_ in some of those experiments. After publication in 1983, no _B. subtilis_ was used at RIID. All this was done prior to 1985. The strain of _B. subtilis_ used by Mikesell and Ivins in the early 1980s was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and discarded at the end of their experiments. If it had persisted, genotyping would have tied it to that ATCC strain.

Some exculpatory evidence:
- Handwriting analysis failed to link the anthrax letters to known writing samples from Ivins.
- No textile fibers were found in Ivins' office, residence or vehicles matching fibers found on the scotch tape used to seal the envelopes.
- No pens were found matching the ink used to address the envelopes.
- Samples of his hair failed to match hair follicles found inside the Princeton, NJ mailbox used to mail the letters.
- He had a chronic skin condition and shed dead skin cells. Such were not found in the spore-filled letters.
- No souvenirs of the crime, such as newspaper clippings, were found in his possession, as commonly seen in serial murder cases.
- The FBI could not place Ivins at the crime scene with evidence, such as gas station or other receipts, at the time the letters were mailed in September and October 2001.
- Lab records show the number of late nights Ivins put in at his laboratory 1st spiked in August 2001, weeks before the 9/11 attacks.
- The FBI report claimed that the anthrax letter prestamped envelopes were sold in Frederick, MD. Later it admitted that millions of indistinguishable envelopes were made, with sales throughout Maryland and Virginia.
- Richard Spertzel has stated that it would have taken him a year with a full lab and a staff of helpers to produce the quality and quantity of spores used in the letters. As such, the FBI's claim that Ivins did it alone working a few nights cannot be true.
- USAMRIID dealt only with liquid anthrax. But the letter anthrax was a hard-to-make dry powder form of anthrax. Fort Detrick does not produce dry anthrax. Also, the anthrax in the letters was also incredibly finely ground, demonstrating technical experience -- all of which would have been outside Bruce Ivin's expertise and abilities.

On 24 Mar 2010, ProMED-mail posted a communication from Stuart Jacobsen, an analytical chemist in Dallas, TX raising 6 serious questions concerning the chemical nature of the spores and specifically the "polymerized glass" coating of the anthrax spores [see Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (04) 20100324.0933]. On 13 Oct 2011, we published our paper confirming that the spores had been microencapsulated [Hugh-Jones ME, Rosenberg BH, Jacobsen S. The 2001 anthrax attack: key observations. J Bioterr Biodef 2011;SE:001. http://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2157-2526.S3-001; see also Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA (08): spore characteristics 20111017.3112]. This was followed by a 2nd paper [Hugh-Jones ME, Rosenberg BH, Jacobsen S. Evidence for the source of the 2001 attack anthrax. J Bioterr Biodef 2012;S3:008. doi: 10.4172/2157-2526.S3-008; in ProMED as Anthrax, human, 2001 - USA: spore characteristics 20130125.1514939] -- in which we further explored the proof of microencapsulation, the extraordinarily high levels of silicon associated with the spores, and the presence of high levels of tin. The anthrax spores in the 2001 letters were of a highly sophisticated nature and way outside the competence of Bruce Ivins. This robust protective spore coating results in an offensive agent. The data for our 2 papers were FBI data that were made publicly available after Bruce died and the National Academy of Science issued its report on 15 Feb 2011.

USAMRIID policy from 1969 to the present includes the following: (1) no dry aerosols, (2) no treatments that enhanced virulence, (3) no treatments that prolonged viability and stability in nature, and (4) no treatments that enhanced stability of spores, toxins or bacteria as aerosolizable material. Any encapsulation of virulent spores would lead to improved survivability and lethality. This would be offensive bioweapons research and a violation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) -- and thus forbidden at Fort Detrick. This did not apply to Dugway or Battelle. Very few if any at Fort Detrick would have had the necessary experience, expertise, or equipment to produce spores similar to those in the letters, nor of such fine quality. Bruce Ivins was not one of them.

It is clear that Bruce Ivins was totally innocent of the claims made against him by the FBI. It is also clear that the FBI made multiple errors in coming to this conclusion, many of which were obvious at the time. And their harassment resulted in his death.

Postscript:
In August 2002, the expert team investigating mailboxes discovered a significantly contaminated mailbox at 10 Nassau Street, Princeton, NJ. It was the 622nd box examined of a total of 635 mailboxes sampled. It was a careful examination, and the positive mailbox displayed 350 colonies on swab culture, a notable number. Over the 10 months since the 2001 mailings, that mailbox had been filled and emptied of letters once each day or 6 times per week. The spores had no surface charge, thanks to the microencapsulation, and therefore would not have attached to the inner surfaces of the box, just lodged and easily displaced. Yet the samplers had no problems demonstrating contamination of the mailbox. Therefore, when mailed in September and October 2001, those anthrax letters must have been grossly contagious. To achieve this, the Nassau Street letters had to have had a previous mailing going through a compression sorting machine once already before the final post on Nassau Street. They were not virgin when deposited in Princeton. The letters with the pharmacist fold contained spores that were mailed to the mailer, who then placed them in the 10 Nassau Street mailbox when the letters were already contagious -- proof that 2 people were involved, if not 3.

I suspect that the mailer sent the spore extractor the envelopes and copies of the letter to be used as pharmacist folds, and as these folds were filled, they were placed in preaddressed prestamped envelopes. As time was short, it is possible that all the envelopes were filled at the same time, with the better quality spores going to the 2 senators. Then the journalist letters were placed in a sealed plastic bag, the senator letters in a 2nd sealed bag, and the AMI letters in a 3rd sealed plastic bag, with all placed in a large envelope and mailed back to the mailer. In going through the compression mail sorter, the envelopes were compressed, and spores released inside the sealed plastic bags. Now "contagious", they were placed in turn in the Nassau Street mailbox. And it is possible that the vehicle used to access the Nassau Street mailbox would have been contaminated. Bruce's car was checked for contamination by the FBI and found to be clean.
