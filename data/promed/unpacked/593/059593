The Subsecretary of Health, Jaime Burrows, confirmed that 2 15-year-old youths, a boy and a girl, are currently hospitalized in serious condition in the Clínica Alemana, due to contracting a hantavirus infection on a trip to the countryside in the Bío Bío Region.

This relates to 2 scouts who, after participating in a camping trip, presented with a cardiopulmonary syndrome that required their transportation to the medical care facility mentioned above, where they are currently connected to mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.

Burrows stated that they are looking for all the people who participated in the activity that was carried out until this [Thu 2 Feb 2017], given the possibility that they have also contracted this disease, which has a high mortality rate.

The Minister also indicated that during this summer season [2016-2017], 14 cases of hantavirus [infections] have been registered. He also explained that the disease has been predominantly reported in the Los Lagos and Aysén regions, although in recent weeks cases in El Maule have been verified.

"While it is not known exactly where they contracted the virus, one possibility is that it was in the Bío Bío Region, where they were on vacation at a camp," the institutional representative added.

The hantavirus[es], transmitted by the long-tailed wild rodent, causes a cardiopulmonary syndrome, as disease that begins with symptoms similar to an influenza illness and later evolves to cardiac and pulmonary insufficiency.

[Although the environment where the 2 youths acquired their hantavirus infections has not been definitely determined, a camp in a rural area would present opportunities for contact with the rodent reservoir or its virus-contaminated feces, saliva, or urine. Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and this only occurs with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
