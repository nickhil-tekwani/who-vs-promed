---------------------------------------------------------------------
Early January 2020, a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) was identified as the infectious agent causing an outbreak of viral pneumonia in Wuhan, China, where the 1st cases developed symptoms in December 2019 [1]. This newly discovered virus, which causes severe acute respiratory disease, is related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus, but distinct from each of these [2]. The key epidemiological parameters, including incubation period, for this new virus are therefore rapidly being studied from incoming case reports as the epidemic continues. Chief among these key parameters is the incubation period distribution. The range of the values for the incubation period is essential to epidemiological case definitions, and is required to determine the appropriate duration of quarantine. Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3-5] and the transmission potential [6,7]. In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, these studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.

Here we present the distribution of incubation periods estimated for travellers from Wuhan with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in the early outbreak phase, using their reported travel histories and symptom onset dates.

In January 2020, an increasing number of cases confirmed to be infected with 2019-nCoV were detected outside Wuhan. For 88 cases detected between [20 and 28 Jan 2020], the travel history (to and) from Wuhan is known, as well as their symptom onset date. Their ages range from 2 to 72 years of age (information missing for 4 cases); 31 were female and 57 were male. During this initial stage of the epidemic, it is most likely that these travellers were infected in Wuhan. Consequently, their time spent in Wuhan can be taken as the duration of exposure to infection. Of these 88 cases with known travel history, 63 were Wuhan residents who travelled elsewhere and 25 were visitors who stayed in Wuhan for a limited time. By taking the date of symptom onset and travel history together, we inferred the possible incubation period for each of these cases.

The data used for this analysis has been translated from Chinese sources such as provincial centres of disease control, and made publicly available [8]. We took the data as available on [29 Jan 2020] (Supplementary Material S1).

[Methods. Available at the source URL above].

Figure 1 [Exposure to reporting timeline for confirmed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) cases with travel history from Wuhan, sorted by symptom onset date, data 20-28 Jan 2020 (n = 88)] shows the exposure to reporting timeline for each case, where the cases without a maximum incubation period lack an unexposed (grey) period. However, the estimated infection times for these cases are close to the end of the exposure window, informed by the cases that do have a maximum incubation period [available at source URL].

The Weibull distribution provided the best fit to the data (Table 1). The mean incubation period was estimated to be 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CI): 5.6-7.7). The incubation period ranges from 2.1 to 11.1 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) (Table 2 and Figure 2). The results using the gamma distribution provide a slightly poorer description of the data, but a similar range: from 2.4 to 12.5 days. Although the lognormal distribution provides the poorest fit to the data, the incubation period ranging from 2.4 to 15.5 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentile) may be relevant for a conservative choice of quarantine periods.

Table 2. Percentiles of estimated incubation period for travellers infected with 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, for different parametric forms of the incubation period distribution, data 20-28 Jan 2020

Figure 2. The cumulative density function of the estimated Weibull incubation period distribution for travellers infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Wuhan, China, data 20-28 Jan 2020

A comparison to the estimated incubation period distribution for MERS (Table 3 and Figure 3) shows that the incubation period values are remarkably similar, with mean values differing at most 1 day and 95th percentiles differing at most 2 days. The estimated mean incubation periods for SARS are more variable between studies, including values shorter and longer than those presented here for 2019-nCoV. These findings imply that the findings of previous studies that have assumed incubation period distributions similar to MERS or SARS will not have to be adapted because of a shorter or longer incubation period.

Discussion
----------
We characterised the distribution of incubation periods for travellers from Wuhan infected with 2019-nCoV in Wuhan who were reported as cases between [20 and 28 Jan 2020]. The study provides empirical evidence to back reports on a familial cluster where 5 family members developed symptoms 3 to 6 days after exposure [10], and fits within the range for the incubation period of 0 to 14 days assumed by WHO and of 2 to 12 days assumed by ECDC [11]. Our estimate of the mean incubation period is longer than the value of 5.2 days based on 10 cases [12], and 4.8 days (range: 2-11) based on 16 travellers between Wuhan and Guangdong [13]. The latter study is restricted to travellers with a 3-day exposure window. Repeating our analysis with only the 25 visitors to Wuhan who had a closed exposure window, leads to a mean incubation period of 4.5 days (CI: 3.7-5.6) which is more in line with the studies above, but the 95th percentile drops to 8.0 days (CI: 6.3-11.8).

In our analysis, we assumed a uniform prior probability of being infected during the period of stay in Wuhan. Since the epidemic was developing during that time period, it is more likely that travellers were infected towards the end rather than the beginning of their stay. This might produce a slight bias towards longer incubation periods, so the estimated upper limit of 11.1 days could be considered conservative.

The travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases. We found travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported in [12]. The numbers are too small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex. Because we only have information on confirmed cases, there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in areas with early awareness and a well-functioning healthcare system. As the epidemic continues, it remains important to collect more information on the incubation periods of 2019-nCoV cases with older ages, with underlying morbidity, who are women or who have mild symptoms.

There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution. The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these 3, the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
As of [4 Feb 2020], 20,471 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) have been reported from China with 425 deaths confirmed so far [1]. There were cases in at least 23 other countries, identified because of symptoms and recent travel history to Hubei province, China. This strongly suggests that the reported cases constitute only a small fraction of the actual number of infected individuals in China [2]. While the most affected region, Hubei province, has ceased air travel and closed major public transport routes [3] the number of exported cases are still expected to increase [4].

Despite limited evidence for its effectiveness, airport screening has been previously implemented during the 2003 SARS epidemic and 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic to limit the probability of infected cases entering other countries or regions [5-7]. Here we use the available evidence on the incubation time, hospitalisation time and proportion of asymptomatic infections of 2019-nCoV to evaluate the effectiveness of exit and entry screening for detecting travellers entering Europe with 2019-nCoV infection. We also present an online tool so that results can be updated as new information becomes available.

Simulation of travellers at each stage of infection with 2019-nCoV
We simulated 100 2019-nCoV infected travellers planning to board a flight who would pose a risk for seeding transmission in a new region. The duration of travel was considered as the flight time plus a small amount of additional travel time (ca 1 hour) for airport procedures. We assumed that infected individuals will develop symptoms, including fever, at the end of their incubation period (mean 5.2 days (Table)) [8] and progress to more severe symptoms after a few days, resulting in hospitalisation and isolation. We also took into account that individuals may have asymptomatic (subclinical) infection that would not be detected by thermal scanning or cause them to seek medical care, although these individuals may be infectious, and that infected travellers may exhibit severe symptoms during their travel and be hospitalised upon arrival without undergoing entry screening. We then estimated the proportion of infected travellers who would be detected by exit and entry screening, develop severe symptoms during travel, or go undetected, under varying assumptions of: (i) the duration of travel; (ii) the sensitivity of exit and entry screening; (iii) the proportion of asymptomatic infections; (iv) the incubation period and (v) the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation (Table).

Table. Parameter values and assumptions for the baseline scenario estimating effectiveness of exit and entry screening at airports for detecting passengers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

Parameter / Value (baseline scenario) / Source
- Duration of travel / 12 hours / Beijing-London [18]
- Sensitivity of exit screening / 86% / Sensitivity of infrared thermal image scanners [19]
- Sensitivity of entry screening / 86% / Sensitivity of infrared thermal image scanners [19]
- Proportion of asymptomatic infections undetectable by typical screening procedures / 17% / 1 of 6 reported asymptomatic in a 2019-nCoV family cluster [11]
- Incubation period / Mean 5.2 days, variance 4.1 days / Reported Gamma distributed mean, variance estimated from uncertainty interval of mean [8]
- Time from symptom onset to hospitalization / Mean 9.1 days, variance 14.7 days / Reported Gamma distributed mean, variance estimated from uncertainty interval of mean [8]

We assume that the time of starting travel is randomly and uniformly distributed between the time of infection and twice the expected time to severe disease, ensuring that simulated travellers are travelling during their incubation period. However, we only consider those travellers who depart before their symptoms progress to being so severe that they would require hospital care [8]. We simulate travellers with individual incubation period, time from onset to severe disease, flight start times and detection success at exit and entry screening according to the screening sensitivities (Figure 1). An individual will be detected at exit screening if their infection is symptomatic -- that is, has detectable fever, their departure time exceeds their incubation period, and their stochastic exit screening success indicates detection. An individual will be detected at entry screening if their infection is symptomatic, their incubation period ends after their departure but before their arrival, they have not been detected at exit screening, and their entry screening result is positive despite imperfect sensitivity. Entry screening detections are further divided into detection due to severe symptoms and detection of mild symptoms via equipment such as thermal scanners. We used 10 000 bootstrap samples to calculate 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Figure 1. Simulated infection histories of travellers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

The incubation period begins on infection and travellers then progress to being symptomatic and having severe symptoms. Travellers may fly at any point within the incubation or symptomatic phases; any would-be travellers who show (severe) symptoms and are hospitalised before exit. Vertical lines represent the exit screening at start of travel (solid) and entry screening at end of travel (dashed) 12 hours later.

The model code is available via GitHub [9] and the results can be further explored in a Shiny app [10] at https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/traveller_screening/ (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Screenshot of Shiny app displaying the number of travellers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) detected at airport exit and entry screening with baseline assumptions, 95% bootstrap confidence intervals, time distributions for incubation period and time to severe disease

Effect of screening on detection
--------------------------------
For the baseline scenario we estimated that 44 (95% CI: 33-56) of 100 infected travellers would be detected by exit screening, no case (95% CI: 0-3) would develop severe symptoms during travel, 9 (95% CI: 2-16) additional cases would be detected by entry screening, and the remaining 46 (95% CI: 36-58) would not be detected.

The effectiveness of entry screening is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the exit screening in place. Under baseline assumptions, entry screening could detect 53 (95% CI: 35-72) instead of 9 infected travellers if no exit screening was in place. However, the probability of developing symptoms during the flight increases with flight time and hence exit screening is more effective for longer flights (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Probability of detecting travellers infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) at airport entry screening by travel duration and sensitivity of exit screening

Each cell is a mean of 10 000 model simulations. Other parameters (incubation period, symptom onset to hospitalisation period, and proportion of asymptomatic infections) were fixed at baseline assumptions (Table). Intervals are probabilities of detection, binned at increments of 10% (0-10%, 10-20%, etc).

Syndromic screening designed to prevent infected and potentially infectious cases entering a country undetected is highly vulnerable to the proportion of asymptomatic infections and long incubation periods. If our baseline scenario is modified to have 0% asymptomatic 2019-nCoV infections and 100% sensitivity of entry screening, the incubation period will need to be around 10-fold shorter than the period from symptom onset to severe disease (for example, hospitalisation) in order to detect more than 90% of infected travellers that would not otherwise report illness at either exit or entry screening.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
As a response to the ongoing outbreak of the 2019-nCoV originating in Wuhan, exit screening has been implemented for international flights leaving China's major airports. Thermal scanning, which can identify passengers with fever (high external body temperature), allows for passengers exhibiting symptoms of 2019-nCoV infection to be tested before they board a plane. Similarly, entry screening for flights originating in the most affected regions may be under consideration at airports in regions in and outside China. We estimate that the key goal of syndromic screening at airports -- to prevent infected travellers from entering countries or regions with little or no ongoing transmission -- is only achievable if the rate of asymptomatic infections that are transmissible is negligible, screening sensitivity is almost perfect, and the incubation period is short. Based on early data from Li et al [8], 2019-nCoV appears to have a shorter incubation period than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and a higher rate of asymptomatic infections [11]. Under generally conservative assumptions on sensitivity, we find that 46 of 100 infected travellers will enter undetected.

Entry screening is an intuitive barrier for the prevention of infected people entering a country or region. However, evidence on its effectiveness remains limited and given its lack of specificity, it generates a high overhead of screened travellers uninfected with the targeted pathogen [5]. For example, when entry screening was implemented in Australia in response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, 1.84 million people were screened, 794 were quarantined, and no cases were confirmed [12]. While some cases of 2019-nCoV infection have been identified through airport screening in the current outbreak, our estimates indicate that likely more infected travellers have not been detected by screening.

It is important to note that our estimates are based on a number of key assumptions that cannot yet be informed directly by evidence from the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak. The current outbreak has spread rapidly and early evidence suggests that the average disease severity is lower than that of SARS. This may also suggest a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases. A recent analysis of a family transmission cluster is based on a small sample size but one in 6 infections was asymptomatic [11]; this is a major impediment for the effectiveness of syndromic screening. However, if asymptomatic cases were not infectious they would not pose a risk for seeding infection chains on arrival. To allow easy adaptation of our results as new insight becomes available in the coming weeks, we developed a free interactive online tool, available at https://cmmid-lshtm.shinyapps.io/traveller_screening/.

While the most up-to-date data on the incubation period or the time until recovery from 2019-nCoV infection have been used in this analysis, these figures are likely to change over time as more data become available. Unless the incubation period is only a small fraction of the duration of infection in relation to that of symptomatic disease, and fever in particular, syndromic screening is likely to detect an insufficient fraction of infected cases to prevent local infections. In addition, the sensitivity of airport screening for the detection of 2019-nCoV has not been evaluated. However, we chose conservative estimates and show that with reduced sensitivity, the effectiveness of syndromic screening would further decline.

In many international airports, information is provided to travellers from affected regions recommending action if they develop symptoms on or after arrival [13-16]. Some countries, for example Japan, also require incoming passengers to complete forms detailing their past and future travel in order to aid tracing [17]. Due to the duration of the incubation period of 2019-nCoV infection, we find that exit or entry screening at airports for initial symptoms, via thermal scanners or similar, is unlikely to prevent passage of infected travellers into new countries or regions where they may seed local transmission.

Another 4 cases of the coronavirus infection were confirmed by the Ministry of Health (MoH) on [Wed 5 Feb 2020], including the youngest patient confirmed so far, a 6 month old baby who is the child of an infected couple. Of the new cases, 3 are linked to the cluster of local transmissions announced on [Tue 4 Feb 2020], and 1 is an imported case involving a Chinese tourist from China's Wuhan city.

On [Tue 4 Feb 2020], MoH announced 6 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, with 4 women here infected who had not travelled to Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus outbreak.

These 4 cases are linked to a group of 20 tourists from Guangxi, China, that visited health products shop Yong Thai Hang in Cavan Road in Lavender. With the cases announced on [Wed 5 Feb 2020], the number of cases linked to the tour group is now 7. MoH said the Chinese health authorities have confirmed that 2 travellers from the tour group have the coronavirus infection.

It reiterated that there is no evidence of widespread community transmission in Singapore for now. Wednesday's [5 Feb 2020] announcement means that the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore is 28. All 4 new cases are in stable condition, while 22 cases confirmed earlier are stable or improving, and 1 case has been discharged, said MoH. The remaining case needs extra oxygen support, but is not in the intensive care unit.

Outside China, Singapore has the 2nd highest number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Japan has the most with 33 cases so far.

Details of new cases
--------------------
The 4 new cases announced here on [Wed 5 Feb 2020] include a father and son -- a Singaporean man and his baby boy. His wife and their maid were earlier confirmed to be infected. The 3rd new case is the Singaporean husband of an infected tour guide, while the 4th is a tourist from China. The father and son, as well as the husband of the tour guide, are among the 7 confirmed cases linked to a tour group that visited the Yong Thai Hang shop.

1st case: The baby boy, who is Singaporean and 6 months old, is the son of a woman who works at Yong Thai Hang, which caters to Chinese tour groups. He is warded in an isolation room at KK Women's and Children's Hospital. MoH said the baby was not in any infant care facility before he was hospitalised -- he was cared for at home. His 28 year old mother is a Singapore permanent resident who did not recently travel to China. On [Tue 4 Feb 2020], MoH confirmed that she and their foreign domestic helper, a 44 year old Indonesian woman, were infected with the coronavirus. This was after Yong Thai Hang was visited by a tour group from Guangxi on [23 Jan 2020]. The Singaporean tour guide of the group was later confirmed to be infected.

2nd case: The baby's father was also one of the confirmed cases announced on [Wed 5 Feb 2020] with no recent travel history to China. The 45 year old Singaporean man is warded in an isolation room at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).

3rd case: Another case confirmed on [Wed 5 Feb 2020] linked to the Chinese tour group that visited the shop is the husband of the group's infected tour guide. The 40 year old Singaporean man also had not travelled to China recently, and is currently warded in an isolation room at NCID. He developed a fever on [24 Jan 2020] and visited Hougang Polyclinic with his wife, a 32 year old Singaporean woman, on [30 Jan 2020]. He went to NCID on [Mon 3 Feb 2020]. Before the man was admitted to hospital, he was at his home in Buangkok Green and worked at Diamond Industries Jewellery Company at Harbour Drive which was visited by the same tour group from Guangxi. The man also visited Pasir Panjang Hawker Centre and used public transport. MOH said that the risk of infection from transient contact, such as on public transport or in public places, is assessed to be low.

4th case: The last confirmed case announced on [Wed 5 Feb 2020] is a 42 year old Chinese national who arrived in Singapore from Wuhan on [21 Jan 2020]. She is the daughter of one of the earlier confirmed cases, a 73 year old woman who is also a Chinese national. As the 42 year old showed symptoms, she was taken by ambulance to NCID on the same day as her mother, immediately isolated, and is now warded in an isolation room at the centre.

Tour group from Guangxi
-----------------------
Regarding the tour group from Guangxi that visited the Yong Thai Hang shop, MOH said that the group was in Singapore from [22-23 Jan 2020], and also transited here for 3 hours on [27 Jan 2020] before leaving the country. The group also visited 5 other places here: Diamond Industries Jewellery Company in Harbour Drive; Meeting You Restaurant in Hamilton Road; Royal Dragon Restaurant in Havelock Road; T Galleria by DFS in Scotts Road; and D'Resort at Downtown East in Pasir Ris. Almost 14 days have passed since the tourists visited these places, and MoH has communicated with 142 contacts. All of these contacts are well except for one who has been isolated as a suspected case. Test results for this person are pending.

The ministry has also done contact tracing for the crew and passengers of the flight that left Singapore with the Chinese tour group on [27 Jan 2020]. 5 of them are still in Singapore and have been quarantined.

Overseas cases linked to Grand Hyatt Singapore
----------------------------------------------
On [Wed 5 Feb 2020], 3 business travellers -- a Malaysian and 2 South Koreans -- linked to a conference at the Grand Hyatt Singapore they attended last month [January 2020], were reported to have tested positive for the coronavirus. The 2 South Korean men had come into contact with the Malaysian, who was infected. Details on how, where and when the Malaysian man became infected were not revealed by MoH. The ministry said that this private business meeting at the hotel from [20-22 Jan 2020] involved 109 people from the same company. Of the 15 Singapore residents at this event, 11 are well. 4 have reported symptoms and were referred to NCID for assessment. The event's remaining 94 overseas participants have since left Singapore and MoH has informed the relevant health authorities abroad.

In Singapore, measures to combat the outbreak include mask distribution at residents' committee centres and community centres islandwide, which began last [Sat 1 Feb 2020]. The government announced on [30 Jan 2020] that all 1.3 million households in Singapore would be given a pack of 4 masks each amid reports of shops running out of stock. On [Tue 4 Feb 2020], it also said that large gatherings and communal activities, such as assemblies and excursions, will be suspended at schools, pre-schools and eldercare facilities here from [Wed 5 Feb 2020], after the 1st local transmissions of the coronavirus were reported.

MoH said on [Wed 5 Feb 2020] that 295 suspected cases have tested negative for the virus so far. Test results for 62 more cases are pending. The ministry has identified 379 close contacts of the confirmed cases. Of these, 304 are still in Singapore, with 299 contacted and being quarantined or isolated. Efforts are being made to contact the remaining 5 close contacts.

MoH continues to advise Singaporeans to defer all travel to Hubei province and all non-essential travel to mainland China. Members of the public should also observe good personal hygiene such as frequently washing their hands with soap. They should also wear a mask if they have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath, and seek medical attention promptly if they are feeling unwell.

[6] Death of physician whistle-blower in Wuhan
Date: Fri 7 Feb 2020
Source: The New York Times [edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/Li-Wenliang-coronavirus.html


Chinese doctor, silenced after warning of outbreak, dies from coronavirus
-------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Li Wenliang issued a warning about a strange new virus. Then the authorities summoned him for questioning. He was the doctor who tried to sound a warning that a troubling cluster of viral infections in a Chinese province could grow out of control -- and was then summoned for a middle-of-the-night reprimand over his candor.

On [Fri 7 Feb 2020], the doctor died after contracting the very illness he had told medical school classmates about in an online chat room, the coronavirus. He joined the more than 600 other Chinese who have died in an outbreak that has now spread across the globe.

Dr Li "had the misfortune to be infected during the fight against the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and all-out efforts to save him failed," the Wuhan City Central Hospital said on Weibo, the Chinese social media service. "We express our deep regret and condolences."

Even before his death, Dr Li had become a hero to many Chinese after word of his treatment at the hands of the authorities emerged. In early January [2020], he was called in by both medical officials and the police, and forced to sign a statement denouncing his warning as an unfounded and illegal rumor.

Dr Li, who was 34 and expecting a 2nd child with his wife, had been a relatively obscure ophthalmologist in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province and the epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic. Dr Li's death has also exposed a troubling aspect of the epidemic that goes unmentioned in official statistics: the number of doctors, nurses, and medical workers infected by the virus.

Some unverified pictures of what appear to be government data have indicated that hundreds of hospital workers may have been infected in Wuhan. Earlier in the outbreak, a prominent infectious disease expert said that a single patient had infected 14 medical workers at one hospital.

Dr Li was also unusually young to be afflicted by the virus, at least according to the data gathered so far. The median of patients is between 49 and 56, researchers say.

When Dr Li posted his chat room warning on [30 Dec 2020], the new coronavirus had not yet been identified. He said it resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, an earlier coronavirus that ravaged China nearly 2 decades ago. Not long after his reprimand, Dr Li was vindicated as thousands of Wuhan residents fell ill with fever and pneumonia symptoms. He joined their number after contracting the virus from a patient he was treating for glaucoma.

Dr Li's death came after a night of speculation about his fate, including an online outpouring of grief in China prompted by premature reports that he had died. Just hours before confirming that he had died, the hospital said on Weibo that it was still fighting to save him. Soon after Dr Li's death was announced, the Hubei Province Health Commission issued a brief message offering condolences, and so did the health authorities of the city of Wuhan. Global Times, a reliably pro-government tabloid, also mourned the death, while also urging readers to support the government's fight against the epidemic. "That Li Wenliang could not escape having his life snatched away shows that this is an arduous and complex battle," an online article in Global Times said. "At this critical juncture, all of us must be united."

Dr Li's death appeared unlikely to inspire protests in Wuhan, which has been under lockdown for just over 2 weeks in an unprecedented effort to extinguish the epidemic. In Wuhan and other heavily restricted areas of Hubei, residents mostly stay inside their homes and avoid socializing for fear of catching the virus. Much of the rest of China is also under tight restrictions that make mass displays of mourning unlikely. Dr Li continued to speak out during his own illness.

[7] WHO situation report 17 (as of 6 Feb 2020)
Date: Thu 6 Feb 2020
Source: WHO [edited]
https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200206-sitrep-17-ncov.pdf


Highlights
----------
- No new countries reported cases of 2019-nCoV in the past 24 hours.

- WHO is working with partners to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for 2019- nCoV detection to improve surveillance and track the spread of disease. WHO and partners have activated a network of specialized referral laboratories with demonstrated expertise in the molecular detection of coronaviruses. These international labs can support national labs to confirm new cases and troubleshoot their molecular assays.

- WHO is convening a global research and innovation forum to mobilize international action in response to the new coronavirus, covering a broad spectrum of research areas including epidemiology, clinical care, vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, animal health, social sciences, and other topics. More details can be found in section [7] below.

[The figures provided in the report are the figures from the National Health Commission of China from 5 Feb 2020. The 6-7 Feb 2020 figures are included in section [1] above. They are posted at approximately 7 PM (GMT-5) which is 1 AM (GMT+1) in Geneva. - Mod.MPP]

Technical focus: establishing global/regional coordination and technical guidance
--------------------------------------------------------------
WHO is working with partners to strengthen global diagnostic capacity for 2019-nCoV detection to improve surveillance and track the spread of disease. Public health efforts to control the spread of disease in countries with imported cases depend critically on the ability to detect the pathogen quickly. WHO and partners have activated a network of specialized referral laboratories with demonstrated expertise in the molecular detection of coronaviruses. These international labs can support national labs to confirm new cases and troubleshoot their molecular assays.

Currently, 15 laboratories have been identified to provide reference testing support for 2019-nCoV. These laboratories include:
1. Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, Thailand
2. Erasmus Medical Center, The Netherlands
3. Hong Kong University, Hong Kong SAR, China
4. Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Japan
5. Institute of Virology, Charité, Robert Koch Institute, Germany
6. National Institute for Communicable Diseases, South Africa
7. National Institute of Health, Thailand
8. National Institute of Virology, India
9. National Public Health Laboratory, Singapore
10. Institut Pasteur Dakar, Senegal
11. Institut Pasteur, Paris
12. Public Health England, UK
13. State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology, Vector Institute, Russia
14. United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention, USA
15. Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Australia

WHO is working to ensure 2019-nCoV test availability, including:
a. screening of 2019-nCoV PCR protocols from academic laboratories for validation data,
b. evaluation of the potential to use existing commercial coronavirus assays (for example, SARS-CoV. to detect 2019-nCoV with high sensitivity, and
c. working with commercial and noncommercial agencies with capacity to manufacture and distribute newly-developed 2019-nCoV PCR assays.

To increase regional testing capacity, efforts to increase national capacity and provide regional reference laboratory support is ongoing. WHO has made 250,000 tests available to WHO Regional Offices and national laboratories. These tests are being shipped to 159 laboratories across all WHO regions.

WHO will also utilize the Shipping Fund Programme established by the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System as a mechanism to send clinical samples from patients meeting the case definition of suspected 2019-nCoV infection to international referral laboratories.

National capacity for detection of 2019-nCoV must be strengthened so that diagnostic testing can be performed rapidly without the need for overseas shipping. One way this will be achieved is by working with existing global networks for detection of respiratory pathogens, such as National Influenza Centres.

https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/06-02-2020-who-to-accelerate-research-and-innovation-for-new-coronavirus


WHO to accelerate research and innovation for new coronavirus
-------------------------------------------------------------
WHO is convening a global research and innovation forum to mobilize international action in response to the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV).
"Harnessing the power of science is critical for bringing this outbreak under control," said WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. "There are questions we need answers to, and tools we need developed as quickly as possible. WHO is playing an important coordinating role by bringing the scientific community together to identify research priorities and accelerate progress."

The forum, to be held [11-12 Feb 2020] in Geneva, is organized in collaboration with the Global Research Collaboration for Infectious Disease Preparedness. The forum will bring together key players including leading scientists as well as public health agencies, ministries of health and research funders pursuing 2019-nCoV critical animal health and public health research and the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, among other innovations.

Participants will discuss several areas of research, including identifying the source of the virus as well as sharing of biological samples and genetic sequences. Experts will build on existing SARS and MERS coronavirus research and identify knowledge gaps and research priorities in order to accelerate scientific information and medical products most needed to minimize the impact of the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

The meeting is expected to produce a global research agenda for the new coronavirus, setting priorities and frameworks that can guide which projects are undertaken first. "Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, transmission and clinical severity and then developing effective counter-measures is critical for the control of the outbreak, to reduce deaths and minimize the economic impact," said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHO chief scientist.

This will also fast-track the development and evaluation of effective diagnostic tests, vaccines and medicines, while establishing mechanisms for affordable access to vulnerable populations and facilitating community engagement.

"The WHO R&D Blueprint is a global strategy and preparedness platform that drives coordinated development of drugs and vaccines before epidemics, and allows the rapid activation of R&D activities during epidemics. It speeds up the availability of the diagnostics, vaccines and treatments and technologies that ultimately save lives," added Dr Michael Ryan, executive director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme. Setting clear global research priorities for the novel coronavirus should lead to more efficient investments, high-quality research and synergies among global researchers.
