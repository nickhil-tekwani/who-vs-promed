Wyoming Game and Fish reports new cases of chronic wasting disease

The Wyoming Game and Fish Department is reporting new discoveries of chronic wasting disease in 2 hunt areas.

Chronic wasting disease is a fatal neurological disease that can hit deer, elk and moose.

The department said its surveillance program found the disease in a doe mule deer from deer hunt area 123, northeast of Lovell. It also found it in a cow elk from elk hunt area 108, southwest of Rawlins.

Both of the new hunt areas are bordered by or overlap hunt areas where the disease was found previously.

Scott Edberg, deputy chief of the game department's wildlife division, said the department takes the disease seriously and continues to research vaccines and evaluate options to try to prevent its spread.

[While these reports represent 2 new areas of finding the disease, it does not sound like it was unexpected. After all, the hunt areas overlap or border areas where the disease has been previously identified.

It would be nice if there were a vaccine for this disease. Perhaps an oral vaccine similar to the oral rabies vaccines for some wildlife can be devised. One has to wonder for how long they have been trying to find a cure or a vaccine and how many research dollars have been used on this type of endeavor? - Mod.TG
