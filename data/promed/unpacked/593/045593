Encephalitis, a mosquito-borne disease [virus], has killed 61
children, mostly Mahadalits [a usually landless and often homeless
class of people], while more than 50 are still fighting for their
lives in Bihar's Gaya district, health officials said on Monday [10
Oct 2011].

All the children died at Anugrah Narain Medical College and Hospital
(ANMCH) in Gaya. The disease has killed a dozen children in the last
one week. "With the deaths of 2 children in the last 24 hours and 10
children in the past 5 days, the death toll has risen to 6," Ajay
Kishor Ravi, who heads the hospital's children's department, said.

According to health officials, the disease started claiming lives of
children from 23 Aug [2011]. Since then, children continue to die of
it. Superintendent of ANMCH, Sitaram Prasad, said that government had
employed several medical teams to control the disease. He said that
more than 270 children with suspected encephalitis were admitted for
treatment at hospital. "Some children are still battling for life as
their condition remains critical. However, some are showing signs of
improvement," he said. Prasad said those children who died mostly
belonged to poorest of the poor families in Gaya and its neighbouring
districts.

Bihar Health Minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey said measures were being
taken to check the spread of the disease. "The government decided to
identify the villages affected and carry out intensive spraying of DDT
to kill mosquitoes," he said.

A district administration official said that encephalitis hit Gaya in
2009, 2007 and 2005 and killed dozens of children.

With 45 samples of brain fever cases having tested positive [for what
pathogen?] in the last the one-and-half-months, the disease has been
the reason for a lot of worry at the Patna Medical College and
Hospital. Three people reportedly died due to the disease, and 2
months ago 51 children died in Muzaffarpur district but the state
government is yet to confirm these as encephalitis deaths.

Last month [September 2011], union Health and Family Welfare Minister
Ghulam Nabi Azad informed the Rajya Sabha that clinical and
epidemiological data suggested that it was an outbreak of acute
encephalitis syndrome, resulting in 150 cases and 55 deaths, mostly
among children. In a written reply, the minister said these cases were
reported from early June to mid-July 2011 from Muzaffarpur and its
bordering areas in Bihar.

[This report initially reports only JE virus as the pathogen
responsible for the encephalitis cases but later quotes an official
who mentions the unspecified acute encephalitis syndrome, which likely
involves enteroviruses as well. Because the breeding sites of _Culex_
mosquito vectors of JE virus are likely to be widespread, vector
control with insecticides is difficult. DDT use is particularly
problematic environmentally. It is not mosquito-specific, affecting
populations of useful insects as well, is a stable compound that is
bioaccumulative, and moves up food chains in the field. Vaccination is
a feasible way to prevent JE virus infections in people living in
areas where JE virus transmission is likely to occur. This and the
following reports below do not give any indication of the proportion
of the at-risk populations that have been vaccinated.

A 5th patient has tested positive for Japanese encephalitis [virus
infection; JE], a deadly mosquito-borne disease [virus] that affects
the brain. The blood sample of a 30-year-old resident of Inderpuri in
southwest Delhi was examined at National Centre for Disease Control
(NCDC). He has been undergoing treatment at Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital
since 1 Oct [2011].

Japanese encephalitis cases have been reported in the city the 1st
time this year [2011]. "The man tested positive for the disease
[virus] on Monday [3 Oct 2011?], but his condition improved, and he
was discharged from the hospital on 8 Oct [2011]. It seems to be a
mild case," said Dr R P Vashishtha, state surveillance officer. He
said all 5 cases reported to date are mild and not life-threatening.
Four other cases -- which included 2 children -- were reported from
Gole Market, Jehangirpuri and Bawana, said Vashishtha.

He said the source of the infection is yet to be traced. "We tested
the blood samples of pigs in the affected areas because they are the
reservoirs of the disease, but all of them tested negative. Now, we
are expanding the investigation, and blood samples of the animals
slaughtered in Ghazipur are being investigated for the infection," he
said. [Pigs are amplifying hosts. Wild birds are reservoirs, and may
well have been the source of virus in these cases. - Mod.TY]

Diagnostic facilities for the disease will soon be set up at Babu
Jagjiwan Ram Hospital at Jehangirpuri, Mahrishi Balmiki Hospital at
Pooth Khurd, and Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital at Rohini.

Dr V K Monga, chairman of the MCD health committee, said the disease
is fatal and transmitted by mosquitoes and cripples the brain. "It
spreads through germs [virus] carried by mosquitoes, which breed in
ponds and paddy fields. The germs are transferred to the pigs through
mosquito-bite. When a mosquito bites an infected pig and then a human
being, the germs [virus] are transferred to that person. The initial
symptoms of the disease are fever and vomiting. Later, it assumes
dangerous proportions and renders the brain ineffective. Presently,
there is no cure available. People should use protection against
mosquitoes," he said. "We are taking all possible steps to stop
mosquito breeding by removing weeds from water bodies and undertaking
fogging in areas along railway tracks and in stagnant water," said
Monga.

[Cases of JE virus infection within Delhi city are of concern, given
the large human population there.

[3] Uttar Pradesh

More than 400 people, mainly children, have died in an outbreak of
viral encephalitis in northern India, health officials say. So far,
2300 patients have been admitted to a hospital in the affected
Gorakhpur area of Uttar Pradesh state. A doctor told the BBC that it
was a "tragedy beyond imagination," with children dying every day.
Nearly 6000 children have died of encephalitis in the hospital since
the 1st case was detected in 1978. Most of the deaths this year [2011]
have happened since July 2011, doctors say.

The disease occurs regularly during the monsoon in the Gorakhpur
region bordering Nepal in the foothills of the Himalayas. The
low-lying areas are prone to floods, providing a breeding ground for
mosquitoes which commonly transmit the virus. Doctors say affected
patients come from 10-12 districts in the region and are mostly poor.

Until 2005, the majority of deaths were caused by Japanese
encephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, doctors say. But in
the past 6 years, children have been dying of other forms of viral
encephalitis, caused by a mosquito-borne virus, doctors say. Both the
diseases cause headaches and vomiting and can lead to comas, brain
dysfunctions, seizures and inflammations of the heart and kidneys.
Doctors say children between the age of 6 months-15 years are worst
affected, and most of the victims are poor people from rural areas.

"It is an unbelievable tragedy. There are 5-10 children dying
everyday," Dr KP Kushwaha, head of paediatrics at the BRD Medical
College, the only hospital treating patients, told the BBC. Most of
the 370 beds in the paediatrics and medicine departments at the
hospital are overflowing with more than one patient to a bed, he said.
A 5th of the children who survive have to live with neurological
weaknesses, doctors say. "Children are most affected because they have
lower immunity, and they end up consuming a lot of contaminated water
at home," Dr Kushwaha said.

Though the incubation period of viral encephalitis is between 3-30
days, patients are brought to the hospital from far-flung areas
because of the lack of adequate healthcare in their villages. "The
public health care system is in a shambles. And the tragedy repeats
itself every year," said Kumar Harsh, a local journalist.

The government says it has tried to check the regular outbreak of the
encephalitis in the region. In 2006 and 2010, 2 massive vaccination
drives against Japanese encephalitis were carried out in Gorakhpur,
leading to a drastic decline of the disease in the area.

The disease is caused by contaminated water. Also, people took
precautions by using mosquito nets and repellents. But tackling other
forms of viral encephalitis has proved to be a tougher challenge, and
controlling it will require a vast improvement in sanitation and
drinking water supplies in rural areas, health officials say.

The state government disbursed over millions of rupees from a federal
health programme for treatment of patients at the state-run BRD
Medical College in 2009. Part of this money was spent in hiring 135
researchers, doctors and paramedical staff to beef up treatment. Most
of the money ran out by August 2009, leaving only 36 of them receiving
regular salaries, say authorities.

The encephalitis outbreak in Gorakhpur has attracted national and
international attention; scientists from the US-based Centers for
Disease Control visited the area in 2009 and took away medical samples
to examine the virus.

In 2005, a virulent outbreak of Japanese encephalitis in Gorakhpur
killed 1000 people, mostly children. This was the worst outbreak since
1978.

[This report does not indicate what the other mosquito-borne virus
might be in addition to JE virus. It does mention that contaminated
water is involved in the encephalitis cases. Previous studies have
shown that several viruses, mainly enteroviruses, have been involved
in encephalitis cases in this area of Uttar Pradesh state (cited in
ProMED-mail archive no. 20111010.3035). Improving sanitation to
eliminate contaminated water in areas of extreme poverty is a
significant and costly challenge.
