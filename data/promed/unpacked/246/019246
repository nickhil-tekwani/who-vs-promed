The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [Tue 12 Feb 2018] that the Arizona Department of Agriculture has confirmed equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM; caused in this case by wild-type equine herpesvirus-1, or EHV-1) in a horse at Turf Paradise, a Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse racetrack in Maricopa County.

"The horse presented with neurologic signs on [Thu 8 Feb 2018], and was moved to a referral hospital," the EDCC stated. "One barn at the racetrack has been quarantined while the Office of the State Veterinarian works with track officials ... to monitor exposed horses."

All owners are advised to practice strict biosecurity measures and report any sick horses to officials, the EDCC said.

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and EHM (the neurologic form). In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from two weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore - and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

After a recent outbreak of NEUROPATHOGENIC EQUINE HERPES, Idaho state veterinarian Dr. Scott Leibsle had extremely good advice for horse owners all over the country.

The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) has received confirmation of equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) diagnosed in horses in Jerome, Gooding and Bannock counties for a total of 3 affected premises. The 3 facilities are privately owned and now are under quarantine.

EHM is caused by a neuropathogenic strain of equine herpes virus (EHV-1) infection and results in neurological signs. One additional premises in Gem County also is under quarantine due to a confirmed EHV abortion in a pregnant mare. An epidemiological investigation is under way for the 4 premises, but no connection between the operations is apparent. The EHV strain affecting the mare in Gem County was a non-neuropathogenic form, which is known to commonly cause respiratory disease as well as abortion in mares.

EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses. The virus poses no health threat to humans. EHV-1 is present in the environment and found in most horse populations around the world. Horses are typically exposed to the virus at a young age with no serious side effects. Research has not yet determined conclusively why horses with EHV-1 can develop the neuropathogenic strain, EHM.

Signs frequently associated with EHM infection in horses include a fever greater than 101.5 F, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, lethargy, incontinence and diminished tail tone. The virus is easily spread by airborne transmission, horse-to-horse contact and contact with nasal secretions on tack, feed and other surfaces. People can spread the virus to horses through contaminated hands, clothing, shoes and vehicles. There is no licensed equine vaccine to protect against EHM.

"We encourage owners to contact their veterinarian immediately if they observe any symptoms of illness in their horses," said Dr. Bill Barton, ISDA State Veterinarian. EHM/EHV is a Notifiable Disease to the State Veterinarian in Idaho. Anyone suspecting or confirming a case of EHM/EHV should call (208) 332-8560 to report cases.

At this time, the decision to cancel upcoming equine events and competitions remains with the event coordinators at each host facility. ISDA urges horse owners to avoid transporting their horses unless absolutely necessary.

Horses that may have been exposed to EHV often take several days to demonstrate clinical illness and run the risk of shedding the virus undetected. Exposed horses that travel to shows or exhibitions could expose other horses before disease containment can be implemented.

ISDA urges horse owners to incorporate preventative biosecurity measures while transporting or boarding horses at facilities with regular traffic on and off the grounds and especially where horses are likely to come in contact with new horses such as at a racetrack, rodeo or fairgrounds. Several preventative biosecurity measures are important in minimizing a horse's risk of contracting the virus:

**Disinfect stalls before use,

**Never share water or feed buckets and tack or grooming equipment,

**Avoid unnecessary contact with other horses.

Additionally, people who work at multiple equine facilities should practice biosecurity measures by washing hands and changing footwear and clothing before entering each facility.

http://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/ehv1-confirmed-at-the-thoroughbred-center-in-lexington/


The Kentucky Office of State Veterinarian has reported a diagnosis of Equine Herpesvirus Type 1 in Barn 3 at The Thoroughbred Center in Lexington, Kentucky, according to a posting early Thursday morning on the Equine Disease Communication Center's website and confirmed by Dr. Robert Stout, Kentucky State Veterinarian and Executive Director of the OSV (Office of the State Veterinarian). The case was reported Tuesday after a horse that had presented with fever of unknown origin was sampled and testing results identified the horse to be positive for EHV-1 'wild type' on both nasal wash and whole blood.

The statement, posted by the Kentucky Office of State Veterinarian, reads, "The barn was immediately secured with no horses being allowed to move into or out of the barn and biosecurity protocols were put in place. The affected barn's population is currently comprised of 18 horses including the index case. Two horses that moved out of the barn prior to the discovery are currently in isolation on a private farm and a barn at The Thoroughbred Center has been emptied and dedicated to serve as the quarantine barn used to isolate the positive horses. Samples collected from the exposed horses earlier today have been partially reported, and has identified six additional positive cases."

Contacted by the TDN Thursday, Stout said there is no reason to believe that potentially infected horses have left the barn at The Thoroughbred Center and gone elsewhere.

"We don't have any evidence of that," Stout said. "In the barn that's quarantined, there were 20 horses. Two of them went back to private facilities. They got saddled in that barn, and that was about it, and then they went back to the farm they came from. They've been tested too and they're isolated on that farm, so they're no risk. Other than that, we don't have any indication that there has been any other movement off the training center of those horses."

Jim Pendergast of The Thoroughbred Center, which is owned by Keeneland, said he is confident that every measure is being taken to promote a thorough and expedited return to normalcy at the facility. Aside from the quarantined barn, operations such as training at the center are being conducted as usual.

"We're working with the state vets office," Pendergast said.

"We're following all their advice and biosecurity protocols and we've got all of those in place in the barn we have isolated. We feel pretty comfortable that we're going to be able to contain this and get things back to normal as quickly as possible."

The site also posted an update on the Turfway Park EHV-1 cases 1st reported [Sat 3 Feb 2018]. The statement from the Kentucky Office of State Veterinarian read, "According to the Kentucky Department of Agriculture there have been no fevers or any other evidence of illness reported in the quarantine barn at Turfway Park Racetrack. Observations during monitoring found horses to be bright, alert, eating and with no evidence of illness."

Stout said Mr. Rusty Ford was on-site at Turfway [Thu 15 Feb 2018] and he is hopeful that the quarantine would be released next week.

With a number of cases being reported across the country in recent weeks-including one at Portland Meadows in Oregon and another at Turf Paradise in Arizona-Stout said he believes the increase in documented cases is at least partially a product of more focused reporting.

"The EDCC (Equine Disease Communication Center), I think they're doing a wonderful job, and I can't say enough about them," Stout said. "There is an increased awareness because of that. I think there's an increased awareness in the general horse people population of the risk of herpes, and the awareness among vets and horsemen have led to more testing. With more testing, you'll find more herpes, and there is more reporting."

Stout added that a number of factors must be considered when attempting to contain the spread of the disease.

"The virus, as far as I know, hasn't changed," Stout said. "Weather conditions certainly play a part, and to correlate increases with weather would be an interesting study. It seems like the viruses like cold weather. It hangs around a little longer, and horses are a little more enclosed. There's no doubt about it. You close up a barn because we think horses need creature comforts like we do, but that's an avenue for infection."

Barn 10 at Belmont Park has been placed under quarantine due to a suspected case of equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM), a respiratory virus that can sometimes be fatal.

In fact, the filly in that barn who was tested for EHM, Ladies Day, was euthanized late [Fri 16 Feb 2018] morning at Belmont. Ladies Day initially spiked a fever on Monday and then had another temperature on [Thu 15 Feb 2018], according to her trainer, Tom Albertrani. The filly could not stand on [Thu 15 Feb 2018], evening through [Fri 16 Feb 2018] morning.

Test results on Ladies Day were not expected back until late [Fri 16 Feb 2018] at the earliest. Dr. Anthony Verderosa, director of the New York Racing Association's veterinarians, said Ladies Day exhibited signs consistent with the neurological form of the disease.

"I'd be very, very surprised - shocked, actually - if she's not positive," Verderosa said [Fri 16 Feb 2018] morning outside Barn 10, which houses horses trained by Albertrani and Michael Dilger.

Ladies Day, a 4-year-old daughter of Bernardini owned by Godolphin Racing, won once from 10 starts.

Albertrani and Dilger both have 10 horses stabled in Barn 10. Those horses will not be permitted to race during what is expected to be a 21-day quarantine period. That includes Evaluator, who was scheduled to run in [Sun's 18 Feb 2018] USD100 000 Gander Stakes at Aqueduct for New York-bred 3-year-olds.

"This is usually a 21-day quarantine and some retesting done," Verderosa said. "Of course, if any horse develops a fever or any other signs then the clock gets reset on the quarantine."

During the quarantine period, horses in Barn 10 will be permitted to train only following the conclusion of regular training hours.

In January [2018], Barn 44 at Belmont was placed under quarantine due to a suspected case of the equine herpesvirus (EHV-1). The horse in question in that case, an unraced 3-year-old trained by Linda Rice, did not show neurological signs of the disease and the quarantine was lifted in less than 2 weeks.

"This is different," Verderosa said. "Linda's horse was positive for EHV-1 but never developed anything but a fever." Verderosa said that only Barn 10 was under quarantine and not the entire Belmont backstretch.

"I am not closing the stable gates," Verderosa said. "I'm confident because of my security people that this situation right here is contained. Plus, the 20 [other] horses are asymptomatic and do not have fevers, so that gives me even more confidence that we've got it under control at this point. But that could change."

There are 11 horses based at Belmont Park that are entered in stakes races Saturday at Laurel Park, including 5 in the Grade 2 Barbara Fritchie. One of those five, Highway Star, will be scratched by trainer Rodrigo Ubillo because he couldn't find a suitable jockey, he said.

Bishop's Pond was entered in both the Barbara Fritchie and Maryland Racing Media on Saturday's card at Laurel, and trainer Jason Servis said he was planning to run her in the Maryland Racing Media.

Laurel officials were awaiting the test results on Ladies Day before deciding whether to allow horses based at Belmont to ship to Laurel.

[It is advisable to keep a close eye on your animal's behavior. Monitoring temperatures and recording them twice daily is very handy at catching early signs of this rapidly moving disease. A slight increase in body temperature may be the only clinical sign early on.

Strict biosecurity in any facility is essential and it must become second nature to anyone working with horses.

Some of the biosecurity pointers in the piece from Kentucky should be heeded. Some are mentioned again here:

**Disinfect stalls before use,

**Never share water or feed buckets and tack or grooming equipment,

**Avoid unnecessary contact with other horses.

Additionally, people who work at multiple equine facilities should practice biosecurity measures by washing hands and changing footwear and clothing before entering each facility.
