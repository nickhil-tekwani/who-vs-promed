2004/078 Situation of several quarantine pests in Lithuania in 2003
-----------------------------------------------
National surveys were done in Lithuania for the presence of several
quarantine pests. The results for 2003 are presented below. Results of
earlier surveys (2000, 2002) were presented in EPPO RS 2000/136 and
2003/050, respectively.
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ [Cmm_] (EPPO A2 list).
Cmm was discovered in 1 glasshouse of tomatoes. Infected plants were
destroyed, and those remaining in the glasshouse were placed under
observation. Present, found in 1 glasshouse of tomatoes, under eradication.
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _sepedonicus_ [Cms] (EPPO A2 list). Cms
was detected in seed potatoes in 1 farm (20 tons). It was also detected on
ware potatoes grown on 3 farms which also produced seed potatoes (131 tons)
and on 21 farms which only grew ware (table) potatoes (726.5 tons). All
infected potatoes were used for food and fodder. Present, found in a few
areas (25 outbreaks), under official control.
_Ditylenchus destructor_ (EU Annexes). 3 outbreaks were identified in seed
potato-growing farms. Present, found in a few areas (3 outbreaks), under
official control.
_Globodera rostochiensis_ (EPPO A2 list). Soil samples were analyzed, and,
as a result, 69 outbreaks were detected over 408.545 ha. On 307.851 ha.,
there had been plans to grow potatoes, and on the rest (100.694 ha), the
land was dedicated to nurseries, ornamental seedlings, and propagation
material for flower production. No potatoes, or any other propagative
material, are permitted to be grown on infested land. Present, found in
