A 32-year-old man who was admitted to Rajkot Civil Hospital with a suspected Congo fever on Saturday [16 Jun 2018] died on Monday [18 Jun 2018]. The hospital officials said that the patient had been suffering from high fever for the past 3 days.

"We have taken samples of his cough and blood, and they have been sent to the laboratory in Puna for examination. It is yet to be confirmed whether the deceased was suffering from Congo fever," said an official from the hospital.

[CCHF was 1st confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 and in July 2013 in Gujarat state. There is plenty of serological evidence that the CCHF virus is endemic in animals /livestock in various states, including 15 districts of Gujarat [Crimean-Congo hem. fever - India (02): (RJ) animal serosurvey 20180510.5791413>].

During 2012-2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Cases were documented from 6 districts of Gujarat (Ahmadabad, Amreli, Patan, Surendranagar, Kutch, and Aravalli) and 3 districts of Rajasthan (Sirohi, Jodhpur, and Jaisalmer).

CCHF is included in the national programme -- Integrated Disease Surveillance Plan -- in the health sector. On the animal side, the state units in known affected areas are being trained in anti-tick interventions, including tick-control measures in animals and tick surveillance, to understand epidemiology of tick-borne infectious diseases. NIV scientists have developed a diagnostic kit (CCHF IgG Elisa) for tracking the virus transmission in domestic animals [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/congo-fever-virus-widely-prevalent-in-the-countrys-livestock-finds-niv/articleshow/63086205.cms].

The reporting of new suspected cases highlights the importance of surveillance for CCHFV IgG antibodies in animals and hemorrhagic fever cases in humans. - Mod.UBA
