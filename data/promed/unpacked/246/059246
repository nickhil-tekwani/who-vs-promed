[1] Case update
- Fri 16 Nov 2018. Epidemiological situation report, DRC Ministry of Health [in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://us13.campaign-archive.com/?u=89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176&id=fddf300d12

The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 15 Nov 2018:
- Since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 352, of which 305 are confirmed and 47 considered probable. In total, there were 210 deaths (of 163 confirmed and 47 probable cases).
- 90 suspected cases under investigation.
- 1 new case confirmed in Katwa.
- 1 new case death confirmed in Katwa.
- 1 new person recovered in Beni.

Current database clean-up
-------------------------
- An additional 7 probable cases have been validated in Kalunguta.

News of the response
--------------------
The National Association of Ebola Winners (ANVE)
- The local committee of the ANVE of Beni was installed this Thu 15 Nov 2018; 2 doctors who were cured of Ebola were elected president and vice-president of the Beni affiliation by the other members.

Vaccination
-----------
- Closure of targeted geographic vaccination in Kanihunga Village, Kalunguta Health Zone. Targeted geographic vaccination, which is wider than conventional belt [ring] vaccination, consists of vaccinating several houses, or even a whole village or district, around a confirmed case when the security conditions do not permit the necessary investigations to be made to establish the list of contacts.

Since the beginning of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 31 224 people have been vaccinated, including 15 729 in Beni.

[It appears that ring vaccination cannot be conducted because it is difficult to identify contacts with the ongoing violence in the region. As long as there is sufficient vaccine available, vaccination of entire villages is a good alternative approach. - Mod.LK]

[2] Summary
- Fri 16 Nov 2018. Armed rebels kill UN peacekeepers in Ebola hot spot, new cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/11/armed-rebels-kill-un-peacekeepers-ebola-hot-spot

A joint operation yesterday against armed rebels near the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Ebola hot spot in Beni killed 7 United Nations (UN) peacekeepers, as officials confirmed one more infection in the outbreak.

The action against the armed rebels, who have been responsible for several attacks against civilians in Beni that have stymied response activities, involved the UN mission known as MONUSCO [Mission de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour la stabilisation en République démocratique du Congo] and government armed forces. Their target was the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).

Forces killed in the clash included one Tanzanian and 6 Malawian "blue helmets", or UN soldiers, according to a UN report. In addition, 10 other peacekeepers were wounded, and another is missing. Several government soldiers and an unknown number of ADF fighters were also killed or wounded.

According to a report in The New York Times [see report below], the joint forces came under attack while trying to remove rebel fighters from a stronghold in Kididiwe near Beni. UN officials speaking anonymously told the Times that the mission was successful, and a number of rebels were taken.

In a statement, UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres condemned the killing of the UN peacekeepers and called on armed groups to disarm and stop their destabilizing activities, which hurt the local population and complicate the Ebola outbreak response. He also urged the DRC's government to keep taking steps to apprehend those responsible for attacks on civilians, government forces, and UN peacekeeping troops.

Beni has been the scene of several violent attacks since the Ebola outbreak began in August [2018], including one in September that resulted in a public mourning period that temporarily halted response operations.

The joint mission push against the ADF forces in the area comes a week after a high-level visit by UN and World Health Organization (WHO) officials to address the security problems, which have been fueled by the DRC's longstanding failure to protect citizens against armed groups in the eastern part of the country.

One confirmed case, more probable illnesses
-------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, the DRC's health ministry today reported one new case, which involves a patient from Katwa. Officials have been cleaning up their case database, which has resulted in the addition of 7 probable cases in Kalunguta.

The new developments bring the outbreak total to 352 cases, 305 of them confirmed and 47 listed as probable. One more death was reported, which involves a person from Katwa, lifting the fatality count to 210. Health officials are currently investigating 90 suspected Ebola cases, which is double the number the health ministry said they were investigating yesterday [15 Nov 2018].

In an update on vaccination efforts, the health ministry said it has used a different strategy to immunize people in Kalunguta, a "red zone" where the security situation does not allow investigators to establish a contact list needed for the ring vaccination strategy used elsewhere in the outbreak region. Instead, health officials have used a targeted geographic vaccination strategy, which consists of vaccinating several households or even a whole village or district around a confirmed case. Overall, 31 224 people have been vaccinated, about half of them in Beni and 1620 in the Kalunguta red zone.

[3] Challenges
- Thu 15 Nov 2018. Expansion to Butembo
[The Telegraph News, abridged, edited]
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/outbreak-ebola-spreads-congolese-city-12-million-sparking-containment/

A surge in new Ebola cases has been reported in a densely populated Congolese city, adding a dangerous dimension to the worst outbreak of the virus in the country's history. Health workers have been forced to open up a new and particularly perilous front after 28 people died of Ebola in and around Butembo, a city of approximately 1.2 million people that is located in the heart of the country's most volatile regions.

The government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) admitted this week that the country's 10th Ebola outbreak is now officially its worst ever, after the number of confirmed infections crossed the 300 threshold. The virus has killed 211 people, the ministry of health said.

Unlike previous outbreaks, which have been restricted to fairly remote rural areas, the present epidemic has swept through populated parts of north eastern Congo, a lawless area that is infested with rebel groups, freelance militias and armed criminal gangs. Already struggling in conditions more challenging than previous outbreaks anywhere in Africa, health workers are now trying to deal with an outbreak that has multiple epicentres.

But nowhere is as worrying as Butembo, where a blend of insecurity, suspicion of aid workers and a large mobile population have created an ideal landscape for the rapid spread of the disease. The outbreak, which was formally declared on 1 Aug [2018], would now be coming to a halt if it had not spread to the town of Beni, with an estimated population of 300 000, where over half of the confirmed Ebola cases have been recorded.

But Butembo has 4 times as many people as Beni, making the outbreak there potentially much more dangerous. Although the 1st Ebola case in Butembo was reported in early September [2018], the disease did not seem to spread rapidly, with only 1 or 2 incidents being reported a week. That changed at the start of this month [November 2018], with aid workers saying that the number of new cases is increasing every day and is expected to continue rising sharply.

The disease is also spreading into rural areas around the city that aid workers cannot access because the areas are too dangerous. As a result, programmes to teach local people methods to slow the spread of the disease -- a strategy that has proved effective in the past -- cannot be implemented so easily.

Hostility toward aid workers and government health officials is also more marked in Butembo than elsewhere. Much of North Kivu is suspicious of Joseph Kabila, the Congolese president, and many believe the government has done little to protect civilians from massacres by local armed groups and may even be complicit in them.

The suspicion has been extended to foreign aid workers because of a perception that the international community places more emphasis on tackling Ebola -- seen as killing comparatively few -- while ignoring massacres that have devastated villages and wiped out families. Organisations like the United Nations' Children's Fund (UNICEF) have had success in convincing people to trust health workers elsewhere, using local radio stations and youth leaders and, most effectively, those who have recovered from Ebola, to win people over. "We as UNICEF work with Ebola survivors who can express de facto 1000 times better than we can how effective the Ebola treatment centres can be," said Yves Willemot, UNICEF's communications chief in Congo.

There is also a sense that the geographic footprint of the outbreak is expanding faster than health officials can cope with. Already, the response plan drawn up by Congo's government and its international partners at the start of the outbreak has been eclipsed by the fact that the number of cases and their spread is far higher than they forecast.

A new plan is in the process of being drawn up, the Telegraph understands, and it may be based on a grim assumption: that, for the 1st time, it may not be possible to end an Ebola outbreak and that containment may be the most realistic strategy.

- Thu 15 Nov 2018. Deaths of peacekeepers and Congolese soldiers
[The New York Times, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/15/world/africa/congo-ebola-united-nations-peacekeepers.html

A total of 8 United Nations peacekeepers and at least 12 Congolese soldiers were killed in a joint military operation against rebels in the north east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is facing a deadly Ebola outbreak, the Security Council said Thu [15 Nov 2018]. In addition, 10 peacekeepers were injured and one was missing after Wed's [14 Nov 2018] operation that targeted Allied Democratic Forces rebels, said the United Nations spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric. The Security Council's statement said 7 of the peacekeepers who were killed were from Malawi and one was from Tanzania.

The joint forces were attacked while conducting operations to dislodge the rebel fighters from a stronghold in Kididiwe, near the regional capital of Beni, a UN official said. The mission succeeded, and a number of rebels were captured, the official added, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Congo's volatile east is home to many armed groups vying for control of the mineral-rich region, and the Allied Democratic Forces are especially active in the Beni area.

The Security Council called on all armed groups to stop the violence immediately and lay down their arms. It also urged Congolese authorities to apprehend and bring to justice the perpetrators of attacks on civilians, national security forces and the peacekeepers. The Security Council emphasized "that deliberate attacks targeting peacekeepers may constitute war crimes under international law."

The Allied Democratic Forces group originated in Uganda as a rebel movement against that country's government. A military campaign forced them to relocate to eastern Congo. Since October 2014, the group's fighters have killed more than 1500 people in the Beni region. UN investigators blamed the Allied Democratic Forces for the deadliest single assault on the peacekeeping mission in Congo in almost 25 years, an attack last 7 Dec [2017] at a base near Beni that killed 15 Tanzanian peacekeepers and wounded 43 others. In recent attacks, the group has also killed civilians and abducted children in the Beni region.

Rebel attacks have forced suspension of efforts to contain the Ebola outbreak in some areas. Dr Peter Salama, the emergencies chief for WHO, predicted on Tue [13 Nov 2018] that Congo's Ebola outbreak, which has killed more than 200 people, will last at least 6 more months. The outbreak is "arguably the most difficult context that we've ever encountered," Dr Salama said, pointing to activities of the armed rebel groups in the region.

[War fighters who kill peacekeepers are guilty of the worst crime. The peacekeepers are sacrificing their lives for others to be able to live in peace. It will be impossible for people in the DRC to live normal lives in peace and without Ebola as long as this conflict prevents health care workers and peacekeepers from doing their work, even taking the extreme measure of killing them. - Mod.LK
