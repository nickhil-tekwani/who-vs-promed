Lab tests confirmed 20 new people from Bulgaria's town of Harmanli
are infected with brucellosis. A total of 36 animals were previously
declared infected with the infection in Harmanli. About 2000 other
samples collected from animals and some 100 ones collected from
people were examined in the beginning of September 2007.
There is still no final conclusion on how the infection was
introduced into the town. Some veterinarians say it might have been
brought to the town as a result of illegal trade with infected
animals, imported from Greece, where such cases are common. Another
hypothesis is that bacteria were brought to the place due to buying
cattle from farmers from the village of Vulche pole, which was
imposed quarantine after it was also hit by the infection. That was
the 1st time in 60 years that an outbreak of the disease is detected
in Bulgaria.

A veterinary officer said Wednesday [26 Sep 2007] 20 people have been
found infected with brucellosis in southern Bulgaria after 4 others
fell ill with the animal disease from contact with sick goats and
sheep. Earlier in September 2007, 121 people in Harmanli were tested
for brucellosis following an outbreak of the disease in a herd of
goats in the southern town.
Harmanli veterinary service chief Delcho Yanev said on the national
radio, 20 samples were clearly positive while 3 were borderline. 4
other people had already been infected with brucellosis from an
outbreak in a flock of sheep and goats in a nearby village earlier in
September 2007.

[Seropositivity for brucellosis suggests (if it is not a false
positive test) exposure at some time. No information is given whether
the height of the antibody titers might have suggested recent
exposure or how many of the people had any symptoms.
Brucellosis is considered a Category B bioterrorism agent, which is,
in nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans. Its
manifestations are protean, including undulant fever, with positive
blood and/or bone marrow cultures, and it is a cause of localized
disease in many organ systems including skeletal, urinary tract,
central nervous system, liver, heart, and lung. The reader is
referred to Young EJ: Human brucellosis. Rev Infect Dis 1983; 5:
821-39 for a review of these manifestations.
Harmanli is a town in Haskovo province bordering on Greece. The
location of Haskovo can be found at
