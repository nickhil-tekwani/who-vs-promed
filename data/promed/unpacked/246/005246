The government of Maniema, a province in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), officially declared Thursday [9 Dec 2021] a monkeypox outbreak. With 191 monkeypox cases, including 24 deaths, reported since 27 Sep 2021, Afani Idrissa Mangala, the acting governor of Maniema, declared in a statement the outbreak in the province.

The outbreak was confirmed after the confirmation of samples sent to the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB), said Mangala, calling on the population to be vigilant and to consult the nearest health centers in case of fever.

In November 2021, a measles outbreak broke out in the same province.

Monkeypox was first identified in 1958, amongst laboratory monkeys. The 1st human cases were discovered in 1970 in the DRC. Fever, itchy toes, headache, muscle pain, and swollen lymph nodes, among others, have been identified as the symptoms of the disease.

The disease is not deadly and can be cured [not cured, instead prevented] through the smallpox vaccine.

[This report provides the added information requested in the 15 Nov 2021 ProMED post (see Monkeypox - Africa (08): Congo DR (MN) RFI 20211115.8699677). No case numbers or fatalities were given in that earlier report. The above report indicates that there were 191 presumably confirmed monkeypox (MPX) cases with 24 deaths. The above report mentions that the disease is not deadly, but there are 24 deaths, giving a case fatality rate of 13%. The situations under which the cases acquired their MPX infections are not reported, but some presumably were from handling infected wild rodents. Other individuals may have become infected from contact with MPX cases. Rodents, such as rope squirrels, door mice and pouched rats, are the suspected reservoir hosts, with monkeys and humans as secondary, spillover hosts. - Mod.TY
