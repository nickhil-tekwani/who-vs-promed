[The high attack rate and case fatality rates seen in the outbreak
are typical of a newly introduced myxomatosis virus. A picture of the
virulence and ease of spread can been seen in the high case fatality
rate of 100 percent and the high morbidity and mortality rates of 75
percent. The latter rates would most likely be even higher if the
remaining 25 susceptible animals on the outbreak no. 1 farm hadn't
been slaughtered. Certainly, when the disease was allowed to run its
course on farm 2, the morbidity and mortality rate was much higher
with 59 of the 62 susceptible rabbits dying.

In fact, the morbidity and mortality rates are so devastatingly high
that the disease has been deliberately introduced to try to control
rabbits because these lagomorphs are a literal pest, eating
vegetation and crops at an almost ecologically intolerable rate.
However, previous attempts at biological control by manipulating the
ecosystem have been less than fully successful in the long run, as is
the case with another high morbidity, high mortality rabbit disease,
rabbit hemorrhagic disease.

Below are the moderator comments from ProMED-mail Myxomatosis,
rabbits - Tunisia (Sousse, Monastir): OIE 20070224.0674, detailing a
cornucopia of myxomatosis epidemiology, including deliberate
myxomatosis introduction, cultural references of the disease, and
clinical signs in the rabbit:

Myxomatosis is seen in several European countries. However, this
disease is probably most famous because of its deliberate
introduction to Australia in an attempt to use this virus for
biological control of the European rabbit _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ in
1950. Schwabe, in his Veterinary Medicine and Human Health, mentions
how this epidemic with an initial case fatality rate of 99.8 percent
settled down and eventually became endemic as the virulence of the
virus decline while the rabbits became more resistant. It was also
deliberately introduced to France by a physician in 1952 and
subsequently spread to the UK in 1953.

This disease does seem to spark the imagination of artists, being the
subject of -- among others-- a poem by Spike Milligan, a Radiohead
song, both The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Watership Down
mention it by name, and a famous Australian children's TV character
is called "Mixy".

The disease itself is caused by a poxvirus that causes skin lesions,
which manifest as swellings in the anogenital areas and head,
sometimes resulting in blindness. This is often referred to as
"sleepy eye". The disease is spread by insect vectors including
mosquitoes. - Mod.PC]
