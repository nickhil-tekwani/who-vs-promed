Another case of legionnaires' disease has been confirmed in Stoke-on-Trent more than 2 weeks after the outbreak began. A Health Protection Agency (HPA) spokesman said the latest case, which brings the total count up to 21, was a man in his 70s. He has been admitted to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire.

Two men have died as a result of the outbreak, which investigators believe can be traced to a hot tub that was on display at JTF Warehouse in Fenton. The HPA spokesman said: "This new case is not unexpected. It can take up to 2 weeks following exposure for people to develop symptoms of legionnaires' disease and a further few days before they might see their GP."

A spokesperson for University Hospital of North Staffordshire said: "Three patients remain in hospital, and all are in a stable or improving condition."

Last week, specialist law firm Irwin Mitchell announced it was helping a number of victims take legal action against JTF Warehouse.

[The current news report above says that the number of cases of legionnaires' disease in the Stoke-on-Trent, England outbreak has increased by 2, from 19 to 21 cases, since the last ProMED-mail post (Legionellosis - UK (12): (England) fatal, hot tub implicated 20120802.1225198), with now 2 deaths. People visiting in the JTF wholesale store were apparently exposed during a demonstration of a hot tub. The previous news report said that an "unusual strain" of legionella has been isolated from the implicated hot tub, and its genotype matches that of the patients' isolates. The hot tub model was pulled from all JTF Warehouse outlets.
