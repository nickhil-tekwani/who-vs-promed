I seem to recall that this [_Salmonella oranienberg_ was the causative
agent of a salmonellosis "epidemic" (actually not that many cases, but
still too many and with a countrywide spread) in the early eighties in
Norway. The cause of the spreading was contaminated pepper from one
producer: It certainly gave an interesting slant to the outbreak: imagine
where pepper is used. [It doesn't help the epidemiologist at all! But it
might be worth bearing this epidemic in mind when evaluating the
"ice-cream" outbreak in Australia.

Might the cause be similar?
