Belo Horizonte has 6 cases of the disease caused by raw fish
-----------------------------------------------
The Sanitary Surveillance unit of Belo Horizonte investigated 6 cases
of diphyllobothriasis -- a disease transmitted by ingestion of raw
fish contaminated by the parasite _Diphyllobothrium latum_ --
reported in Belo Horizonte from July 2004 through March 2005. The
agency opened an inquiry to identify the circumstances under which
the infections had occurred. Data was requested from the major
private laboratories of the capital of Minas Gerais [Belo Horizonte]
after the outbreak of the parasite had been identified in Sao Paulo,
following a recommendation made by the National Agency for Sanitary
Surveillance (ANVISA). This was the 1st time that the disease had
been identified in the city in the past 45 years, according to the
laboratories.
Outbreak: The director of Sanitary Surveillance of the municipality,
Eduardo Camargos Couto, however, discounted the possibility of an
outbreak in Belo Horizonte. According to him, the 6 positive fecal
examinations [identification of the parasite in specimens that were
submitted to the laboratories - Mod.MPP] done by the laboratories are
"insignificant," since the total number of examinations performed by
the laboratories was 432 000. The stated period during which the
cases had been detected, according to the manager, also lacks the
characteristics of an outbreak. There were 3 cases reported during
the period July - October 2004 and another 3 cases during the period
January - Mar 2005. In any case, the Municipal agency decided to open
an inquiry to investigate the cases, interviewing the infected
individuals in order to know whether they were infected in Belo
Horizonte or in other cities. The owners of the 27 Oriental
restaurants in the capital of Minas Gerais have decided to import
only frozen fish in order to follow the rules determined by ANVISA.
Salmon imported from Chile will be transported at temperatures of
minus 50 C in order to reduce the risk of contamination with
_Diphyllobothtium spp._.

[We tend to agree with the claim of the director of Sanitary
Surveillance, Eduardo Camargos Couto, that the 6 cases cannot be
regarded as an outbreak but rather seem to represent the background
risk. Discussed in previous postings was whether salmon is infected
with _Diphyllobotrium_ spp., and it still remains to be demonstrated
that salmon in sushi pose a risk of _Diphyllobotrium_ spp. infection
in humans. - Mod.EP]
