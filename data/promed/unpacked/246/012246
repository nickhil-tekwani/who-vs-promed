Suspected case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Santa Cruz, Bolivia
----------------------------------------------------------------------
SANTA CRUZ: A 41 year old man was admitted to the Hospital Santa Cruz on
Tue 14 May 2002 with a 7 day history of malaise, fever, dry cough, and
dyspnea. From 4 to 6 May 2002, he was hunting at Las Cachuelas, which is
650 km from Santa Cruz de la Sierra.
On Fri 17 May 2002, he required mechanical ventilation for worsening
hypoxemia and progressive pulmonary infiltration, fulfilling criteria for
adult respiratory distress syndrome.
A confirmatory test was carried out on Sat 18 May 2002 and [reported
positive] yesterday for enzyme linked immunoassay IgM against Los Andes
virus. A serum has been sent for a [confirmatory] polymerase chain reaction
test.

[ProMED-mail welcomes this prompt notification from Dr Saavedra. The
diagnosis of hantavirus infection is based on a positive IgM result and
must be considered preliminary. The hantavirus Andes virus has been
associated with cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina and
Chile and may be the etiological agent in this case. The reservoir host of
this virus is the long tailed pygmy rice rat _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.
Another hantavirus named Rio Mamore virus, with reservoir host
_Oligoryzomys microtis_, has been recorded in Bolivia, but its association
with human disease has not been documented so far. Information on the final
diagnosis would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
