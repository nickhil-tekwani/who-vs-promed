New Zealand is currently experiencing an increase in meningococcal disease.
The 37 cases during 1996 compared with 22 in 1995 [in Christchurch] reflect
national figures of 473 compared with 394 cases. The majority are type B
[for which there is no vaccine; however, antibiotics are effective - Mod.JW].
