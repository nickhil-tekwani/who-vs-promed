BLUETONGUE - EUROPE (09): BTV-8, GERMANY, REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

In its posting "Bluetongue - Europe (06): BTV-8 20070407.1170", of 7 Apr
2007, ProMED-mail reported the detection of a BTV-8 positive sentinel
bovine in Osnabruck, the State of Lower Saxony, Germany, a finding
indicative of recurrent activity of the virus and that led to the
application of corresponding preventive measures in the (neighbouring)
Netherlands.
Later in April 2007, this finding was denied by Dutch sources, basing their
information upon data obtained from the Lower-Saxony authorities.
ProMED-mail published said information on 26 Apr 2007, in its posting
"Bluetongue - Europe (08): BTV-8, Germany, NOT 20070426.1360". So far, no
additional information on this issue has come to our attention.
Germany's presentation to the European Union's Standing Committee on the
Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), in Brussels, 3-4 May 2007, titled
"Bluetongue -- update on the situation in the Federal Republic of Germany"
has now become available. It includes, among others, the table
"BT-examination of sentinel animals (domestic) (150 km zone) in 2007" with
the following (extracted) data:
Cattle:
Total establishments tested (in 12 States): 6338
No. of samples: 83 857
Positive: 31
Negative: 83 826
The positive samples were found in Hesse (12), Lower Saxony (15),
Rhineland-Palatinate (3), and Saarland (1).
Sheep and goats:
All examined sheep (594) and goats (108) were found negative.
Wild ruminants:
According to the table "BT-examination of sentinel animals (wild ruminants)
(150 km zone) in 2007", all sentinel wild ruminants sampled in 8 states
(848 deer, 159 red deer, 14 mouflons, and 34 others [not identified]) were
found negative.
A 1st hand interpretation of these data, particularly regarding the 31
positive sentinel bovines, and the opinion of SCFCAH on the possible
overwintering/recurrence of the virus, would help to clarify the situation.
