Last week, 3 patients from Afghanistan suspected to be suffering from Congo fever were admitted to the hospital. The National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad on Monday [21 Jul 2014] confirmed that one of them, age 15, tested positive for the virus, while the results of a man, age 55, and another man are still awaited.

HMC [Hayatabad Medical Complex] spokesperson on infectious diseases, Dr Wali Rehman said 12 patients suffering from the virus have been brought to HMC so far this year [2014], of whom 6 have died. He said it takes up to 15 days for the results of the blood tests to arrive from NIH.

Dr Rehman said personal protection equipment has been provided to the hospital staff, and no one is allowed to visit the isolation wards without gowns, gloves and masks. He added that 4 private rooms at HMC have been declared isolation units for [Crimean-] Congo patients and that any individual brought to the casualty department with the symptoms will be directly admitted to the isolation ward.

[The number of CCHF virus infections has increased from 8 on 12 Jul 2014 to 11 infections 4 days later, and now there are 12 on 22 Jul 2014.

CCHF virus is endemic in Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is not clear how many of these infections were acquired in Pakistan or in Afghanistan. It is good to see that barrier nursing and personal protective measures are being taken in the hospital.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
