Following the bird flu scare in Chandigarh, one of the workers involved in the culling of 110 domesticated geese in the city's Sukhna Lake has been admitted to a Panchkula hospital with symptoms similar to avian influenza (H5N1).

An employee of Chandigarh's forest department, the patient has been kept in an isolated ward in the hospital. "His samples have been sent to PGI Chandigarh. A few symptoms similar to the avian flu have been found," a doctor from the hospital said, requesting anonymity. The person admitted had complained of chest and throat congestion along with a headache. He had gathered the geese before killing and burning them. The Union government on Thursday [18 Dec 2014] allowed the Chandigarh administration to cull nearly 110 geese. 22 had died earlier, and one had tested positive for avian influenza. The lake will remain restricted to the public for a month to start with.

The bird flu scare has brought down the sale of poultry products in the region. The danger also looms large over other neighbouring wetlands, which receive migratory birds in large numbers. After a sample of geese from Sukhna lake here tested positive for bird flu, authorities culled 110 geese on 18 Dec 2014 on the island in the middle of the lake. The entire culling operation, which went on till midnight, was carried out as a precautionary measure to prevent any outbreak of bird flu in the city and adjoining areas.

The authorities here today [22 Dec 2014] decided to collect samples of poultry at random from the city, even as samples of 3 persons who were admitted to hospital here with flu-like symptoms have turned out to be negative [for H5N1 avian influenza].

Meanwhile, 5 geese died in a pond at the village Bhambri of Fatehgarh Sahib district under mysterious circumstances, officials said. The Animal Husbandry department collected the samples and sent them to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Jalandhar to test the samples for the deadly H5N1 virus. Dr J S Bhatia, deputy director of the Animal Husbandry Department, confirmed that samples have sent to RDDL Jalandhar.

In Chandigarh, samples were today [22 Dec 2014] collected around the Sukhna lake. "Today, we collected samples from poultry farms located in the close vicinity of the Sukhna lake. The places from where the samples were lifted included Bhagwanpura and Kishangarh villages. We also held meetings with some village heads to create awareness and explained to them the precautionary measures they need to take," sub divisional magistrate (central) Prince Dhawan, who is UT's nodal officer dealing with the avian flu, said.

"Soon, we will expand this exercise to the entire city and take samples at random from different poultry farms here," he said. Dhawan said that meetings were held today [22 Dec 2014] between officials of the Chandigarh administration and Punjab and Haryana governments in view of the bird flu scare.

The tests of 3 patients, who were admitted to hospitals here with flu-like symptoms, have turned out to be negative, said Lovelesh Kant Gupta, joint director of the Chandigarh Animal Husbandry department.

The Chandigarh administration has also been conducting a door-to-door survey in the localities close to the lake as a precautionary measure, officials said. The authorities at various zoos and wetlands across Punjab and Haryana have intensified monitoring and surveillance of the birds.
