UN Doctors Sent to Treat Victims of 'Chemical-Bombs' in Sudan
-----------------------------------------------------------
A team of medical doctors sent by the United Nations to treat
hundreds of civilians suffering from severe infections, allegedly
caused by toxic chemical weapons, on Thursday arrived in the
southern Sudanese towns of Lanya and Kaya, on the border
with Uganda.
Sharad Sapra, the spokesperson at the UN humanitarian office in
the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, said the team will determine the
cause of the disease and provide treatment for the affected
people.
People affected in the 2 towns have complained of sore eyes,
running noses, sore throats, and disorientation following a series of
air raids in the rebel-held areas by the government in Khartoum.
But the Sudan government, which is a signatory to all international
instruments against manufacture and use of weapons of mass
destruction, has denied the allegations, saying they are part of "a
well orchestrated plan by the West" to bring more international
pressure against it. Khartoum also denied allegations that it has
been acquiring chemical weapons from Iraq.
The main rebel group in the south, the Sudan People's Liberation
Army (SPLA), last week accused the Sudanese government of
using toxic chemical weapons while on a bombing mission on
civilian relief centres in the region.
The SPLA, in a statement, alleged that Russian-built Sudanese
Antonov planes dropped up to 16 bombs on Lanya and some six
others on Kaya on July 23.
"After the bombings, children and grown ups started to vomit blood,"
the statement said.
It claimed that a number of pregnant women in the affected region
have suffered miscarriages, while cattle, sheep, goats and birds
have been dying in large numbers, adding that two UN World Food
Programme workers were rushed to neighbouring Uganda
unconscious. No fatalities have been reported.
Since the civil war broke out in Sudan in 1983, the government has
routinely conducted aerial bomb raids on rebel-controlled areas in
the south. SPLA is fighting for self-determination for the south in a
war which has cost close to 2 million lives.
According to the rebel movement, the latest round of bombing left
foul-smelling greenish colourations on the ground. "These reports
confirm fears that chemical or biological agents were used in the
bombing," SPLA spokesperson in Kenya, Samson Kwaje, said.
The Norwegian People's Aid agency, which operates in the region,
has confirmed the bombing. In a statement issued in Oslo on
Tuesday it said a team of scientists had found evidence from soil
samples that indicated use of toxic chemicals in the bombing raids.

[We held off reporting this outbreak until there was independent
outside evidence. The absence of fatalities suggests that a riot
control agent may have been contained in the bombs. These
agents are unfortunately not banned by international treaty -
