Four bodies of wild elephants have been found in the jungles of Riau
province. Environmentalists suspect that the animals were dead after they
were poisoned. "A sample of the poison found near the dead elephants are
[sic] being examined in laboratory," Samsuardi, an activist of the WWF
[World Wide Fund for Nature] conservationist group was quoted by Antara
news agency as saying.
One dead elephant was found at a forest near Segati village in Palalawan
regency, while the 3 others were found at a timber estate owned by PT Siak
Raya Timber. Samsuardi estimated the animals were killed one month ago.
Meanwhile, Nurcholis Fadli also from WWF said that he believed villagers
killed the elephants because they had been destroying crops, or because
starving elephants had trampled at least 4 farmers to death last month.
He said he believed the dead elephants were from the same family in Tesso
Nilo National Park, where several other elephants were found dead earlier
this year. Fadli said the elephants had been covered with tree branches
while roads leading to their location were blocked by logs, Fadli said.
"There were strong indications that the animals were intentionally
poisoned," Fadli was quoted by AP as saying in Pekanbaru. He urged
authorities to take firm action to stop such killings. He said at least 20
wild elephants have been killed so far in 2006. Sumatra's elephant habitats
are quickly shrinking due to illegal logging and land clearing. About 2500
are believed to live wild on Sumatra.
