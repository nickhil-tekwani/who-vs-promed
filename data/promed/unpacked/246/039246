Some middle Tennessee residents are been battling an unusual and
uncomfortable illness. Health officials say that 14 people in Hickman
County were diagnosed with dysentery last week. Some of the infected were
students at three different Hickman County schools. Most of them have been
treated and have recovered fine.
State health officials say it's unusual
for people in the United States to have the infection; it's generally found
mostly in underdeveloped countries. Health officials say it's spread when
people don't wash their hands after using the bathroom. Dysentery causes
severe diarrhea and can be fatal if it's not treated.

does anyone have that information? - Mod.JW]
