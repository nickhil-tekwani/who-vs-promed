Michigan hunter contracts bovine TB, state says
-----------------------------------------------
A hunter who cut his hand while gutting a deer is the 1st living person
diagnosed with the strain of bovine tuberculosis found in some northern
Michigan deer and cattle, officials said on Thu 6 Jan 2005. [Actually, I
believe that the unique issue is not the acquisition of _Mycobacterium
bovis_ in a human -- which is well known -- but, rather, acquisition in a
human of cutaneous bovine TB from a Michigan deer - Mod.LL]
The man killed the deer in Alcona County in October 2004 and sought medical
attention after spotting telltale lesions in the animal's chest cavity,
said TJ Bucholz, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Community Health.
He would not identify the man or his hometown, but said he is being treated
and is expected to recover.
The community health department laboratory in Lansing identified the TB
strain last week [1st week of Jan 2005]. The strain also was found during
an autopsy of an elderly person who died in 2002, but it was not the cause
of death, Bucholz said. Different strains of the disease have been found in
8 people from foreign countries in Michigan since 1995.
The disease -- rare in humans but highly contagious in animals -- has
saddled Michigan farmers with costly testing requirements and hampered
their ability to market cattle in neighboring states during the decade-long
outbreak in the northern Lower Peninsula. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention have no statistics on bovine TB in humans, spokeswoman
Karlie Stanton said. But studies show that eradication programs and milk
pasteurization have reduced the number of cases over the years.
Human cases usually are caused by breathing infected barn air or drinking
unpasteurized milk from a sick cow. It's extremely rare to get the disease
the way it happened in the latest case [cutaneous transmission - Mod.LL].
"This appearance of bovine TB in a human underscores the human health risk
of the disease in free-ranging deer," said Janet Olszewski, state community
health director. "People should not consume wild animals that appear or are
confirmed to be sick, regardless of the circumstance." The case also shows
the importance for hunters of wearing gloves while gutting deer and washing
hands afterwards, said Rebecca Humphries, director of the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources. The infected man was not wearing gloves.
The USDA revoked Michigan's status as free of bovine TB in 2000. State
officials have ordered testing of the state's nearly one million cattle,
and some herds have undergone multiple testing, said Bridget Patrick,
coordinator of the state's eradication task force. Cattle on 34 farms and
483 deer have tested positive. Goats and elk are among other animals
susceptible to the deadly sickness, which attacks the lungs and sometimes
the digestive tract. Michigan has asked the USDA to restore the TB-free
status in the Upper Peninsula, where no cases have been found. The federal
agency in 2004 upgraded most of Michigan to "modified accredited advanced,"
the rating immediately below TB-free. 11 counties and parts of 2 others in
the northern Lower Peninsula retained a lower rating.

[Human infection from bovine tuberculosis caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_
has been mostly, but not completely, eradicated in the USA by the use of
pasteurization of milk and culling of herds shown positive on skin testing,
starting in about 1917. It continues to be reported in the USA, primarily
in immigrants (1), although it generally accounts for less than one per
cent of all mycobacterial isolates. The organism is part of the _M.
tuberculosis_ complex along with the tubercle bacillus, the BCG bacillus,
and _M. africanum_. _M. bovis_ can be distinguished from _M. tuberculosis_
by specific gene probes (the standard probe just identifies the _M.
tuberculosis_ complex), specific biochemical reactions and routine
resistance to pyrazinamide. Although called bovine tuberculosis, the
bacillus has a broad host range, including cattle, pigs, goats, cats, dogs,
badgers, foxes, marsupials, rabbits, sheep, horses and, in this case, deer.
Between 1975 and 1978 several foci of _M. bovis_ were identified primarily
in white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in several counties on the
lower Michigan peninsula, which caused the _M. bovis_ Accredited-Free
Status to be suspended and the loss of as much as USD 74 million by the
livestock industry of the state.
Among the surveys of _M. bovis_ in Michigan free-ranging white-tailed deer
is one from 1997 (2), in which examination of 354 hunter-harvested deer
showed gross lesions of tuberculosis in 15 deer and a further 16 with
histologic evidence of tuberculosis, 12 of which yielded _M. bovis_. A
later study from 2002 reported an apparent decrease in TB prevalence in
deer of about 50 per cent by banning baiting and feeding and increasing
antlerless permits (3).
