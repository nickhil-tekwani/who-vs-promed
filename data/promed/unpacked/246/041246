About 200 people were killed by rabies each year in Nepal due to
overwhelming number of stray dogs in the country and the shortage of
effective anti-rabies vaccines, according to a seminar on the control of
rabies.
Secretary of Ministry of Agriculture Mukti Shrestha said Friday at the
seminar that controlling the multiplying numbers of stray dogs in urban
areas could be a solution as the post exposure vaccines available in the
country is not very safe.
"The rabies vaccine in Nepal is not safe, because of which the coordination
between government and municipalities is important in the process of
controlling the disease," said Shrestha.
Shrestha also proposed killing or taking population control as solutions,
which were objected by animal rights activists. This dispute has left the
problem of controlling the proliferation of stray dogs unresolved. There
are so many stray dogs in urban areas of the country that no one can tell
the exact number of them.
The one-day seminar on the strategy to control rabies in animals and human
beings was jointly organized by National Zoonosis and Food Hygiene Research
Center of Nepal and UK-based World Society For Protection of Animals.

[Further details on this situation have been requested from the organizer
of this one-day seminar. A reliable vaccine for dogs, good annual
immunization rates (>80%), and stray dog control are the three key
components of any and all effective urban canine rabies control programs. -
