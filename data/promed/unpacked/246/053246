SOURCE OF GUATEMALAN BERRY CONTAMINATION UNKNOWN-U.S.
WASHINGTON -- Experts with the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) were cited as telling a U.S. Senate panel investigating
food safety at a hearing on Thursday that scientists have yet to trace the
cause of 2,500 cases of food poisoning from Guatemala raspberries, but
water used by local growers remains the most likely cause.
The story says that after disease outbreaks in 1996 and 1997, exports of
the raspberries were voluntarily halted by Guatemalan farmers. The Food and
Drug Administration said it would ban 1998 exports until farms adopted a
series of precautions, such as filtering water used for irrigation and
pesticide spraying.
The story adds that Canada, which has continued to import berries from
Guatemala, last month reported more than 200 additional illnesses that may
be connected to the raspberries (305 last I heard; doubt they will have
similar public hearings in Canada -- dp)
Dr. Stephen Ostroff, an investigator with the CDC was qutoed as saying,
"The preliminary data suggests that these are once again linked to
Guatemalan raspberries."
CDC investigators are, the story says, working with the Canadian government
to try to crack the latest cases there. But no laboratory methods yet exist
to detect cyclospora on berries or in water, according to the CDC.
Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who heads a Senate subcommittee
that has been investigating the safety of imported food, was cited as
saying that most of the raspberry-linked illnesses occurred during
Guatemala's spring rainy season. Guatemalans are accustomed to diarrhoeal
problems in the spring, referring to it as "mal de mayo," or the May
disease, adding that "The subcommittee's purpose is not to indict one
country or region of the world but to focus on a case study of tainted
imported fruit -- from the farm in a foreign country to the tables of
America -- in order to understand how we can better protect American
consumers."
