The Nasarawa state commissioner for health, Emmanuel Akabe, on Thursday [9 Jan 2014] confirmed that there is an outbreak of Lassa fever in Lafia, which has so far claimed the life of one person.

Mr Akabe, who confirmed the death of the victim in an interview in Lafia, said the victim died on Tuesday [7 Jan 2014] at the Dalhatu Araf Specialist Hospital. He said that the infected person was admitted into the hospital last week with symptoms of severe fever and bleeding. The commissioner explained that these symptoms prompted the medical personnel to send his blood specimen to the Lassa fever diagnostic centre at Irua in Edo, where he was confirmed positive to Lassa infection.

Mr Akabe explained that the hospital did its best to quickly isolate and treat him, and he became fairly stable until Tuesday [7 Jan 2014] when he died. He disclosed that a blood specimen taken from the victim's wife and others who had close contact with him was sent for examination, and all came out negative.

The commissioner said a team of medical personnel had been deployed to the Bukan Sidi area of the town, where the deceased resided, with a view to educating the people about Lassa fever. He said that the ministry had commenced a sensitisation programme in Lafia and its environs, educating the people to look out for such symptoms to quickly save lives, saying early detection of the disease would guarantee proper management and treatment.

"If the deceased had reported early enough to the hospital, the situation would not have gotten this bad. He came to the hospital at the bleeding stage of the disease," Mr Akabe said.

The commissioner, therefore, charged members of the public to shun self-medication but to visit the nearest hospital for proper medical attention in order to stay alive. He also encouraged the people to properly cook and cover their food as well as maintain good environmental habits that would keep rodents, "which are the major agents of Lassa fever, away from sources of food."

On the need to have a Lassa fever diagnostic centre in the state, Mr Akabe said that, considering the capital intensive nature of such centres, it would be difficult to establish for now. He noted that there were only 2 of such centres in the country at present. He recalled that the federal government through the Ministry of Health in 2013 promised to establish a Lassa fever diagnostic centre in each of the geopolitical zones, considering the recurrent outbreak of the disease and its fatality rate in parts of the country. Mr Akabe, therefore, appealed to the federal government to expedite action on the plan to establish such centres, saying, "it will go a long way to save more lives through early detection and treatment."

The commissioner said that the state government was working in collaboration with an organisation in the USA with the aim of establishing a research institute in Lafia to handle issues related to diagnosis and treatment of viral diseases, including Lassa fever, TB and HIV/AIDS, among others. He explained that the project was expected to be funded by the USA, adding that a Memorandum of Understanding will soon be signed to that effect.

The victim was a civil servant who worked in the office of the deputy governor, Dameshi Luka.

[Nigeria's latest Weekly Epidemiology Report dated 3 Jan 2014 covers the last week (52) of 2013. It says:

"3.1. No suspected Lassa fever case/death was reported in week 52 (2013) compared with 33 suspected cases with 0 deaths from Edo State in the same period in 2012.

3.2. Between weeks 1 and 52 (2013), 1192 suspected Lassa fever cases with 161 lab confirmed and 36 deaths (CFR, 3.02 percent) were reported in 27 LGAs [Local Government Areas] across 14 states compared with 1723 cases with 197 lab confirmed and 112 deaths (CFR, 6.50 percent) in 42 LGAs (23 states) at the same period in 2012 (Figure 6)."

Unfortunately, the latest weekly report on Nigeria's Ministry of Health website at http://www.health.gov.ng/doc/EpidReport1.pdf is only for Week 49, dated 13 Dec 2013, but Fig. 7 on p. 6 is very similar to the Fig. 6 referred to above.
