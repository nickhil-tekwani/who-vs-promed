Numbers of Cryptosporidiosis cases expected to rise
--------------------------------------------------
City officials are assuring residents the city water supply is safe, but
they still haven't nailed down the source of a cryptosporidium outbreak.
There have been 23 confirmed cases of the diarrhea-inducing parasite in the
city since the first case was reported 22 Aug 2003, and health officials
believe there probably will be more.
More than 2/3 of those who contract cryptosporidiosis are children. As part
of their investigation, health officials visited 2 Lawrence day-care
centers and found one case of the parasitic infection. "We feel like it's a
very narrow case, though we've encouraged any child who has symptoms to get
a (stool-testing) kit and get tested," said Lleanna McReynolds, director of
the Raintree Montessori day-care center.
Students at 4 Lawrence elementary schools were sent home last week with
questionnaires designed to help authorities determine how far the disease
has spread and whether the outbreak has a common source. More than 600
responses were returned over the weekend. Using data from the responses,
the Lawrence-Douglas County Health Department has been contacting potential
carriers of cryptosporidium to pick up a stool-testing kit to help with
diagnosis. Kay Kent, director of the Health Department, said those
responses likely would lead to a rise in the number of diagnosed cases.
However, she said potential carriers of the parasite were not cooperating
with testing as well as she would like.
Shari Stamer, the city's water quality manager, said she's confident the
city's water supply is not the culprit that is spreading the illness. "I
can't tell the public it's not out there, at least in the source water,"
she said. "It's not a sterile environment, we know that. Because of how we
handle our business here, at the plants, and how the work is being done,
I'm pretty confident the water is safe." Kent said terrorism is not a
likely source of the parasite, either. "We've asked that question
ourselves," she said. "Just because of the location of the cases and where
they occurred, we don't believe so. But we asked that question -- you
always ask that question these days."
