What may have sparked off the current investigation, requested by ACMSF,
was the following press release in USA in July.
ANTI-MILK GROUP EXPOSES CLAIM THAT NORMAL PASTEURIZATION KILLS DANGEROUS
BACTERIUM IN MILK July 14/98
NEW YORK -- The Anti-Dairy Coalition has denounced a claim, based on a
recent U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) study, that normal
pasteurization practiced by dairy producers nationwide inactivates a
dangerous bacterium routinely found in raw milk.
In his weekly Anti-Dairy Coalition Newsletter column on the Internet,
Coalition executive director Robert Cohen says the USDA study, which was
reported in the May 10, 1998 issue of Hoard's Dairyman, a trade
publication, has been completely misrepresented by the agency and by the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in claiming that normal pasteurization
(72 degrees centigrade for 15 seconds) destroys _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_, the bacterium linked to Johne's disease in cows and
Crohn's disease in humans that produces persistent and severe diarrhea.
Cohen, author of "Milk - the Deadly Poison," says that the USDA study
actually revealed that the dangerous bacteria were not totally inactivated
until after 15 minutes of pasteurization at 72 degrees centigrade. That's
"very bad news for all milk drinkers," says Cohen. "Normal pasteurization
at this temperature calls for only 15-second treatment, not 15 minutes. We
believe the government and Hoard's Dairyman are misleading the public into
thinking pasteurized milk is safe from _Mycobacterium paratuberculosis_
when the USDA's own scientist is saying that pasteurization inactivates the
bacterium only when the process maintains at least 72 degrees centigrade
for at least 15 minutes. That's 14 minutes and 45 seconds longer than the
normal commercial pasteurization of milk in the United States."
The USDA study is entitled "Heat Inactivation of _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_ in Raw Milk: Are Current Pasteurization Conditions
Effective?" Based on this study, Hoard's Dairyman told its 100,000-plus
milk producer subscribers, "Heat treatment (pasteurization) destroys this
dangerous disease."
Cohen says the FDA supports the same conclusion. He refers to a letter
addressed to government officials from Joseph Smucker, team leader of the
Milk and Safety Team at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, a
branch of the FDA. The letter says: "After a review of the available
literature on the subject, it is the position of FDA that the latest
research shows conclusively that commercial pasteurization does indeed
eliminate this hazard."
Cohen says every assertion about pasteurization's effectiveness is refuted
in the abstract of the USDA study, which states: "Currently, it is not
known whether commercial pasteurization effectively kills _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_ in contaminated raw milk." "This sentence," Cohen says,
"contradicts every conclusion made from this very same paper!"
The senior author of the abstract is Judy Stabel, Ph.D. On the second page
of Dr. Stabel's paper (published in the December 1997 issue of Applied and
Environmental Microbiology), she reveals: "Bacteria were not totally
inactivated until after 15 minutes of incubation (pasteurization) at 72
degrees centigrade." In her paper, Dr. Stabel also writes: "There is no
definitive evidence to date that viable M. paratuberculosis is present in
retail pasteurized dairy products."
When she was asked why there was no evidence and if milk samples had ever
been tested at retail sites, Cohen says her response was "No." When asked
"Why not?" she replied, "I don't know." However, Cohen contends that
British scientists have taken milk samples at the point of retail purchase
and have cultured live tuberculosis [presumably she means _M.
paratuberculosis_ - MHJ bacteria from these samples.
Cohen concludes that the FDA and USDA have misinterpreted Dr. Stabel's
paper, and scientific evidence suggests that this dangerous bacterium
survives pasteurization. "This is just another example of how Americans are
being betrayed by regulatory agencies like FDA and USDA," Cohen warns.
Formed in June 1998, the Anti-Dairy Coalition includes some of the
country's top physicians and health educators: Dr. Julian Whitaker, author
and editor of the monthly newsletter, Health & Healing; Dr. Charles
Attwood, often called heir apparent to Dr. Benjamin Spock; Dr. Vicki
Griffin; Dr. Daniel Twogood; Dr. Richard DeAndrea and Dr. Richard Schwartz.

However, the following information was subsequently provided by IFT to its
Science Communicators by e-mail, and I received a copy as part of the
mutual exchange of food safety information between IFST and IFT -- :
It appears that the Anti-Dairy Coalition ignored results from the second
half of Stabel et al. (1997). The researchers examined the effectiveness of
two methods of heat inactivation to inactivate _Mycobacterium
paratuberculosis_ in raw milk:
(1) the holder test tube method, often used in previous studies but not
used commercially, in which the milk is held still during treatment; and
(2) the lab-scale pasteurizer method, which simulates high-temperature,
short-time (HTST) conditions in commercial pasteurization and in which the
milk flows through the pasteurization unit.
Stabel et al. concluded that the flow of milk during commercial
pasteurization is essential for effective killing of the _M.
paratuberculosis_. Effective pasteurization via the non-commercial holder
test tube method did, indeed, require 15 minutes at 72degC. The researchers
stated: "Bacteria were not totally inactivated until after 15 min of
incubation [via the holder tube method of pasteurization at 72degC." These
are the results reported, perhaps not in sufficient detail, by the
Anti-Dairy Coalition.
The latter commercial method, however, did effectively kill the bacteria
within 15 seconds. The researchers state: "Results from _M.
paratuberculosis_ heat inactivation experiments when the lab-scale
pasteurizer method was used indicated that both strains of _M.
paratuberculosis_ tested, 19698 and Ben, at a concentration of either 10^4
or 10^6 CFU/ml were effectively inactivated after treatment at 72degC for
15 s (data not shown)."
The authors write:
"Studies conducted in our laboratory with the lab-scale industrial
pasteurizer unit have demonstrated that turbulent flow of milk during
pasteurization is essential for complete killing of contaminating _M.
paratuberculosis_."
Also of interest is a Letter to the Editor, charging that Stabel et al.
dismissed previous work which concluded that HTST pasteurization may not
effectively kill the bacteria. The letter also questioned the use of frozen
and _sonicated M. paratuberculosis_.
In a rebuttal, Stabel wrote: "In our opinion, the laboratory-scale
pasteurizer unit utilized in our laboratory simulates commercial
pasteurizer units more closely than any other methodology employed to date.
Results from our studies with the laboratory-scale pasteurizer indicate
that HTST pasteurization effectively kills all _M. paratuberculosis_ cells
experimentally inoculated into raw milk."

*********
The UK requirement of 71.7 degrees C for 15 seconds or any equivalent
combination [UK Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995 (Schedule 4, Part
II, 2(a) are only very slightly less than the US requirement of 72 degrees
C for 15 seconds.
Can that marginal difference account for the preliminary finding of a few
commercial samples in N Ireland containing _M. paratuberculosis_? Or do the
results suggest either that not all plants there are effectively complying
all the time with the process required by the UK Regulations, or that in
those instances post-pasteurisation contamination has occurred?
It seems to me that important immediate requirements must be to trace the
positive samples back to the plant(s) whence they came and to investigate
the equipment, the processing records and the plant hygiene.
