North Korea could be facing a scarlet fever epidemic after the disease
broke out in Oct 2006 in its Ryanggang province which borders China, South
Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Wed, 15 Nov 2006.
It quoted a source close to North Korea, who declined to be named, as
saying the disease had been spreading fast to other parts of the country
and risked turning into a full-blown pandemic.
The Daily NK (<http://www.dailynk.com>), a Web site run by anti-North
Korean government activists, in October 2006 quoted a number of sources as
saying that the disease had spread to several places along the border and
the area had been closed and quarantined.

[Scarlet fever (also called scarlatina) is characterized by an exudative
pharyngeal process with fever, a "strawberry" tongue and a characterisitc
scarlatiniform rash. It is caused by an infection with a pyogenic
exotoxin-producing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.
The rash appears 1 or 2 days after onset of fever and sore throat,
initially on the neck and then spreading to the trunk and extremities.
The rash has a texture that feels like coarse sandpaper with erythema
blanches with pressure. It may be pruritic but usually is not painful. A
few days following spread of the rash, it becomes more intense along skin
folds and produces lines of confluent petechiae known as the Pastia sign.
These lines are caused by increased capillary fragility.
The rash begins to fade 3-4 days after onset, and a desquamation phase
begins. This phase begins with flakes peeling from the face. Peeling from
the palms and around the fingers occurs about a week later and can last up
to a month.
The "strawberry" tongue begins to be noticable during the first 2 days of
the disease with the development of a white coat through which the red and
edematous papillae project. This is referred to as a white strawberry
tongue. After 2 days, the tongue also desquamates, resulting in a red
tongue with prominent papillae called the red strawberry tongue.
The location of Ryanggang province where the outbreak began can be found at:
