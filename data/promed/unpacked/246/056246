New deer bait, feed rules proposed
-------------------------------------
By Eric English
New rules may soon ban feeding or baiting of white-tailed deer in a larger
area of northern Michigan.
The state's Natural Resources Commission is considering a number of new
feeding and baiting regulations in a stepped-up effort to control an
outbreak of bovine tuberculosis [due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ affecting
Michigan's deer herd. "The commission is talking about taking some
additional steps to eradicate bovine TB," said George Burgoyne, resource
management deputy and second in command at the Michigan Department of
Natural Resources. "A reduction in the amount of baiting is certainly a
possibility and maybe some additional restrictions on feeding," Burgoyne
said today. The proposed rule changes were outlined at a Natural Resources
Commission meeting held last week in Cheboygan.
The commission is expected to vote on the changes at its regular meeting in
June. If no decisions are made at that meeting, the current rules and
regulations are likely to remain in effect for another year, Burgoyne said.
Currently, the state has banned feeding or baiting of deer in an area of
northeastern Michigan bordered by Interstate 75 and M-55, where TB is most
prevalent among deer. In all other areas of the state, hunters are limited
to the use of 5 gallons of bait per hunting site. The new regulations
proposed this month include:
Increasing the area where feeding and baiting of deer is banned. One
proposal would expand the area in Northeast Michigan to county boundary
lines. Another proposal would ban feeding and baiting in any county where a
deer or livestock has tested TB positive. That would include Osceola,
Antrim and Mecosta counties. Limiting the use of bait in other areas of the
Lower Peninsula to 2 gallons per hunting site and 5 gallons in the Upper
Peninsula. The reduction in baiting in the Lower Peninsula is a step toward
the elimination of baiting for deer in Michigan.
Allowing hunters to place bait only when they are present at the hunting
site. State Rep. Dale Sheltrown, D-West Branch, is critical of the Natural
Resources Commission's ban on deer baiting and feeding in Northeast
Michigan. Sheltrown represents Iosco and Ogemaw counties, which are partly
included in the feed-ban area. "It doesn't make sense to penalize the 11
counties when there is TB outside that area," Sheltrown said today.
Sheltrown said he favors a 5-gallon baiting limit for Northeast Michigan to
make it easier for bow hunters to harvest deer and reduce the population of
the animals.
But Sheltrown said authority rests with the Natural Resources Commission on
issues regarding Michigan wildlife after voters approved the statewide
ballot Proposal G in 1996. Sheltrown said he will testify before the
commission in June in an effort to influence its decision. The Resources
Commission has approved restrictions on the use of bait and feed to reduce
the amount of nose-to-nose contact by deer, which is thought to be a
primary way the animals infect each other with TB.
As of March, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources has discovered
282 TB-positive deer out of 27,175 tested, or about 1 percent. Results of
TB testing in 1999 showed 57 TB-positive deer out of 19,488 tested.
However, testing revealed three deer infected with the chronic lung disease
outside the northeastern Lower Peninsula in Osceola, Antrim and Mecosta
counties.
In addition, TB has turned up in at least five cattle herds in Alpena,
Alcona and Presque Isle counties.

[For those who regard hunting as a sport and as such necessitating skill,
craft, and hard won experience I make no excuses for what some Americans do
to be assured of getting a deer in, or out of, season. No wonder, white
tailed deer are now a plague. A cold winter and no supplemental feed would
go a long way to cull these herds of clinically affected animals, and many
others as well, and by reducing the density reduce the incidence. - Mod. MHJ
