New Zealand Doctors Urged to Be on Lookout for New Virus
--------------------------------------------------------
The New Zealand Ministry of Health has issued a warning to local doctors to
be on the lookout for a new and potentially dangerous virus, which has
infected at least 50 people in the country.
A senior public health advisor, Doug Lush, said in a press release issued
by the ministry here Monday that symptoms of Echovirus type 33 (Echo 33)
infection can include diarrhea, headache, fever and a rash, but the virus
can also cause a type of meningitis [aseptic meningitis, which is
different from the potentially fatal meningococcal [bacterial meningitis.
Echo 33 is not spread through sneezing and coughing, but through poor
hygiene, Lush said, adding that handwashing and good personal hygiene are
the best ways to stop the virus from spreading. While most victims do not
need treatment, some people, particularly small children, may have to be
hospitalized if they contract Echo 33, according to the public health advisor.

[The genus _Enterovirus_ includes four groups of human pathogens: the human
coxsackievirus, human echoviruses, human enteroviruses and human
polioviruses. Many of these viruses have been associated with outbreaks of
aseptic [i.e. non-bacterial meningitis, including the following:
coxsackievirus A 1-11, 14, 16-18, 22, 24; coxsackievirus B 1-6; enterovirus
70, 71; and all the echoviruses, except 24, 26, 29, 32. The significance of
the present outbreak is that echovirus type 33 has been less frequently
reported in association with outbreaks of disease than many of the other
enteroviruses and the population may have little immunity to restrict the
extent of this outbreak.
In 1994, an outbreak of echovirus type 33 (EV33) infection occurred in a
maternity hospital in Japan. Nine new-born babies were infected, some
presenting symptoms of encephalitis or disseminated intravascular
coagulation. Subsequently serum antibody positivity in the general
population was examined. A total of 649 serum samples taken before the
outbreak, and 344 samples taken after the outbreak, from individuals aged
between 7 days to 65 years old, was examined. It was observed that the
average positivity rate was 12.0% and the rate increased depending on age.
It was concluded that the low positivity rate in young adults resulted in
only a low level of (or no) antibodies in newborn babies.
In an earlier study of enteroviral infection in pregnant women, reported in
Brazil in 1990, intrauterine infections with echoviruses 27 and 33 were
judged to have contributed to fetal death. Consequently although viral
meningitis generally follows a benign course, the authorities in New
Zealand are adopting a prudent course of action in the face of this
outbreak. -Mod.CP
