Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Thailand
---------------------------------------------
In felines in a zoo (follow-up report No. 4)
See also: numerous reports from 23 Jan to 19 Nov 2004
This report is based on information received on (and refers up to) 19 Nov
2004 from Dr Yukol Limlamthong, director general, Department of Livestock
Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok:
End of previous report period: 12 Nov 2004 (Disease Information 2004;
17(46): 341, 12 Nov).
21 days have elapsed since the last deaths, involving only tigers, on 28
Oct 2004 and disinfection of the infected premises.
All the necessary control measures against highly pathogenic avian
influenza (HPAI) have been strictly implemented to prevent any further
spread of the disease.
Samples have been collected from all susceptible animals, from zoo staff
and from the environment for laboratory testing to evaluate disease status
before re-opening the zoo to the public.
The suppliers of the potentially contaminated batches of whole or chicken
bone carcasses have been accused by the Department of Livestock Development
of illegal animal movement in contravention of the Animal Epidemics Act
B.E. 2499 (1956) and Revision BE 2542 (1999). They have been questioned by
the police.
The HPAI Operating Centre of ChonBuri Province has reported that the
in-contact and sick groups of 102 tigers were euthanised on the basis of
clinical signs. The remaining 294 tigers are under surveillance.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza in Thailand in felines in a zoo
-----------------------------------------------------------------
(follow-up report No. 3)
See also: numerous reports from 23 Jan to 19 Nov 2004
This report is based on information received on (and refers up to) 12 Nov
2004 from Dr Yukol Limlamthong, director general, Department of Livestock
Development, Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, Bangkok:
End of previous report period: 29 Oct 2004 (Disease Information 2004;
17(45): 326, 5 Nov).
No clinical disease or deaths have been observed in any species in the zoo
since 28 Oct 2004.
The at-risk group of tigers was re-treated with an anti-viral drug
(oseltamivir), administered twice daily (morning and evening) in a piece of
meat for 5 consecutive days (less than 60 kg body weight: 75
mg/animal/dose; 60 kg body weight and above: 150 mg/animal/dose).
The suppliers who supplied the batches of whole or chicken bone carcasses
suspected of being contaminated have been undergoing police interrogation
to try to obtain the relevant information.

[The loss of 147 out of 441 tigers due to apparently criminal activity (one
should properly invoke the "innocent until proven guilty" caveat) is
outrageous. As a veterinarian, I view this with disdain.
This incident underscores 2 imperatives for animal and human health
officials. 1st, at a very practical and local level, sick birds must be
identified and disposed properly under strict supervision. These reports do
not say whether the carcasses were from farms subject to the authority of
animal health officials or whether farmers knew very well they had sick
birds and found a market before they gathered any official notice. Either
way, infected birds can't be transported some distance to be fed to zoo
animals or you wind up with the present situation.
Only when farmers cooperate can you avoid the classic "tragedy of the
commons", when what is good for an individual farmer's profit and loss
statement is devastating for the larger community. Clearly someone tried to
minimize their loss from the outbreak of avian influenza but caused an
outbreak in zoo tigers. The ironic element is that zoos are quickly
becoming an environment designed very carefully through species management
plans to preserve animals that are coming under pressure from human
activity. Certainly no one anticipated this kind of threat to the tigers.
The 2nd imperative is we devote adequate time to understanding how our
complex, modern market driven systems provide linkages for the emergence of
disease. It may only be good luck that the zoo tigers did not infect their
human keepers or zoo visitors, thereby extending a very convoluted viral
infection pathway from bird to tiger to human. - Mod.PC]
