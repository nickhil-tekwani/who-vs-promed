_P.falciparum_ Malaria imported to Austria from Lombok, Indonesia
-----------------------------------------------------------
Male, Austrian tourist, 72y, travel to Lombok and Bali for 25 days, no
pre-travel counseling and no chemoprophylaxis.
Symptoms started 12 days after return with fever, cough, diarrhoea,
vomiting. Admitted to hospital 6 days after the symptoms started,
where he died 3 days later with renal failure and shock despite
treatment with quinine and artemisinine.
A similar case was reported from Austria in August [2001: a tourist
died after contracting _P. falciparum_ malaria at Lombok. This tourist
had presumably taken chloroquine, proguanil, and malarone, but
schedules and compliance are not known.

[_P.falciparum_ malaria is a potent
ially lethal disease if not treated in time. Bali is believed to be malaria-
free, but Lombok is known to be endemic for _P. falciparum_. The last
data on the webpage for Roll Back Malaria
<http://w3.whosea.org/malaria/indonesia.htm>
are from 1998, and there is no recent report of a resurgence of malaria
at Lombok. However, this could very well be the case, and further
reports based on national statistics with assumed country of infection
are needed as well as reports from the local authorities. - Mod.EP
