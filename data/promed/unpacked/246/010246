This morning, [Tue 15 Sep 2009], during an inspection of a field of
maize in Carnet, St James, Normandy, I found some plants infected with
the boil smut, _Ustilago maydis_. Some cobs were well infected with
what the Mexicans call huitlacoche. They were very good examples.

[Boil (or common) smut of maize is caused by _Ustilago maydis_. It
attacks any above-ground part of the plant to form blisters or galls
containing black spores. Mature galls can grow as large as 20 cm (about
8 in) in diameter. The yield of affected cobs is very low. They may be
toxic to livestock but are eaten in South America as 'huitlacoche'
(Mexican corn truffle), which consists of the immature fungal galls and
is considered a delicacy.

Spores can be spread by wind, seed, on clothes or farm machinery, and
can survive in the soil for many years. Disease management includes
plant hygiene measures, crop rotation, seed treatment with fungicides
and use of resistant crop cultivars.

Boil smut was reported from the same region in France in 2008, but it
is not clear from this report whether the same fields are affected.
Depending on whether crop rotation has been practiced, the current
outbreak is likely to be due either to inoculum left behind from the
previous crop or fungal spores spread from affected fields.
