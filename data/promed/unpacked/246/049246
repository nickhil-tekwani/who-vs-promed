The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture has issued a state animal health alert after several show pigs tested positive for influenza while being exhibited at the Stoughton Fair [Stoughton, WI]. The agency says the animals were tested after returning to their home farm. The fair took place 4-9 Jul [2017].

Veterinarians are asked to be on alert for sick pigs and made aware that pigs showing clinical signs of illness are not allowed at fairs and shows. DATCP officials say they were not aware of any human illnesses as a result of the incident, though swine influenza can be zoonotic.

Because of their proximity, the Dane County Fair, Green County Fair, RockCounty Fair and Waukesha County Fair all fall within the 30 day validity period for a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection if pigs were shown at the Stoughton Fair. State Veterinarian Dr Paul McGraw reminds all veterinarians to examine the whole herd of origin prior to issuing a CVI in the event some pigs on the farm are ill, even if they are not the pigs going to the show.

"Exhibitors who showed pigs at the Stoughton Fair should closely monitor their pigs for signs of swine influenza," McGraw said. "Influenza can spread whenever animals or people congregate, and fairs are no exception. While rare, influenza A viruses can spread from people to pigs and from pigs to people."

If pigs are showing signs, owners should contact their veterinarian for an evaluation even if they have a valid CVI issued within 30 days and if they exhibited at the Stoughton Fair.

[The 1st paragraph of this report is temporally confused as to whether these pigs were sampled while at the fair or after their return to their home farms. Either way the opportunity for infecting a significant number of other pigs may have taken place, with those animals possibly infected now near the end of the incubation period to display clinical symptoms. - Mod.MHJ
