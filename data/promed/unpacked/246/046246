Nusa Penida Islands on Rabies Alert
-----------------------------------
The District government of Nusa Penida in the Klungkung regency of
Bali has declared an "extraordinary situation" (status kondisi luar
biasa) for rabies for the island group located a short distance form
Bali's southeast shore. The district of Nusa Penida includes the
islands of Nusa Gede, Nusa Ceningan and Nusa Lembongan.

The "extraordinary situation" alert was issued after the recent death
of 2 local residents from rabies. Prior to these deaths, officials
and local resident assumed the islands had escaped the epidemic of
rabies taking place on nearby Bali.

Quoted in Beritabali.com, the head of the Bali Heath Office, Dr.
Nyoman Sutedja, declared a rabies alert for Nusa Penida on Mon 17 Jan
2011. He expressed concern for the 17 dog bite cases that have
occurred in past months that went untreated in the mistaken
assumption there were no infected dogs on the island.

Calling for a ban on the movement of dogs between the island and the
outside world, Sutedja said hilly geography of the islands
complicated efforts to control rabies. He also said that dogs
carrying the virus may be sheltering in the caves found in the hills
of the islands.

[It was reported previously on Mon 10 Jan 2011 that 2 residents of
the island of Nusa Penida had died in a Bali hospital as a result of
suspected rabies virus infection. That diagnosis now appears to have
been confirmed and also that infection had occurred as a result of
dog bite on the island of Nusa Penida -- previously considered to be
a rabies-free zone. Currently there are another 17 inhabitants of the
island who received dog bites in the past few months and are
potential rabies cases since they received no post-exposure
prophylaxis in the mistaken belief that the island dogs were free of rabies.

Visitors to any part of Bali should be aware that there are no
rabies-free zones on the main island and its off-shore islands, and
that the problem of canine rabies in Bali is far from resolved.
