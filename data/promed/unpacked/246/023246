[1] Germany (Bavaria): case follow up and contact tracing issues
Date: Sun 16 Aug 2020 10:20 AM CEST

The state of Bavaria said it had tracked down most of the people returning from abroad who tested positive for the COVID-19 but were not told about it.

The German state of Bavaria said Sunday [16 Aug 2020] that it has tracked down most of the people returning from abroad who tested positive for the coronavirus but were not told about it in a debacle that embarrassed a possible successor to Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Bavaria said in a statement that it had found 903 of the 949 people who tested positive out of 44 000 travelers returning to the country, while it could not locate personal data for 46 of the positive tests.

The tests had been carried out up to 2 weeks ago at special centers that were opened with great fanfare in the southern state, but problems with data entry meant that the travelers had been waiting for their test results for days.

Bavaria's state premier, Markus Soeder, apologized for the problems Thursday [13 Aug 2020], promising to fix the mistakes by adding extra staff. He also said he supported his health minister, who had offered to resign.

Germany has managed to keep its numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared to other European countries, but there are concerns about a possible second wave of the pandemic.

On Saturday [15 Aug 2020], Germany had its biggest increase in confirmed coronavirus cases since late April, a rise of 1415, but the increase Sunday was just 625, although fewer cases are usually registered over weekends.

[Follow up of travellers at points of entry becomes a crucial area for focus, in order to check re-introduction of new cases in areas with low transmission. However, the lag between samples being taken from travellers and results becoming available may lead to delay in tracking and isolating the positive cases and initiating contact tracing.

Data compilation at the points of entry with detailed contact information should be ensured as the pandemic enters in to the more 'unpredictable' low activity phase. - Mod.UBA]

[Most of the pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries, have either been caused by an influenza virus or a coronavirus. The 2003 SARS coronavirus pandemic had a much smaller impact than this current coronavirus pandemic, and killed fewer than 1000 people.

The scale of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented with global impact on health systems, economies, and continuity of life as we knew it previously. While on one hand there are a lot of hard learned lessons, there have also been excellent examples of resilience, and dedicated efforts by health care, public health professionals, and the community.

The current COVID-19 pandemic seems unlikely to be over any time soon, with various scenarios for the future estimating either several overlapping outbreaks or another ferocious wave later in 2020.

Historical evidence from influenza pandemics that occurred in the past century shows us that pandemics tend to come in waves over the 1st 2 to 5 years as the population immunity builds up (naturally or through vaccination), and then the number of infected cases tends to decrease. This observation is the most likely trajectory for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. What should sound a note of caution for the world is that the 2nd wave of the H1N1 (Spanish flu) and H3N2 in 1968 influenza pandemics were also much more severe than the 1st ones, potentially because the viruses underwent mutations that increased their virulence.

The near future will require a transition to a new normal, in which a combination of physical distancing, enhanced testing, quarantine, and contact tracing will be needed for a long time. - Mod.UBA]

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is beginning. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mod.MPP]

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
- For the week ending [16 Aug 2020], over 1.8 million new COVID-19 cases and 39 000 new deaths were reported to WHO. This brings the cumulative total to 21.2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases including 761 000 deaths (Figure 1). In the past 7 days, the number of reported daily cases rapidly increased with an average of 260 000 cases and 5500 deaths.
- The WHO Region of the Americas remains the most affected region in the past 7 days, accounting for 53% of all newly confirmed cases and 75% of reported deaths.
- The South-East Asia Region continues to report an increase in cases and is currently the second most affected region.
- While the number of cases decreased in the Eastern Mediterranean Region from the end of June through to 10 August, a 10% increase was reported in the number of cases reported in last seven days. The number of reported deaths, however, have continued to decrease across the region.
- The Western Pacific Region reported a large increase in the number of deaths compared to the previous seven days, although, this accounted for just 1% of the new deaths reported globally.
- The African Region reported a decrease in the number of cases and deaths over the past 7 days (Table 1, Figure 2).
- Due to the resurgence of cases in many countries, stay at home measures and travel restrictions are being re-implemented as part of efforts to limit the transmission of the virus.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://covid19.who.int/table.

- The Americas region reported 54% of cumulative case numbers and 54% of the global deaths since the start of the pandemic; with 53% of the global newly reported cases and 75% of newly reported deaths in the last 7 day period, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 11.4 million cases.

- The European region reported 18% of cumulative case numbers and 28% of the global deaths since the start of the pandemic; with 10% of the global newly reported cases and -7% of newly reported deaths in the last 7 day period

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 8% of cumulative case numbers and 6% of the global deaths since the start of the pandemic; with 5% of the global newly reported cases and 7% of the global newly reported fatalities in the last 7 day period.

- The African region reported 4% of cumulative case numbers and 2% of the global deaths since the start of the pandemic; with 3% of the global newly reported cases and 5% of the global newly reported fatalities in the last 7 day period.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2% of cumulative case numbers and 1% of the global deaths since the start of the pandemic; with 2% of the global newly reported cases and 1% of the global newly reported fatalities in the last 7 day period.

- The South East Asia region reported 14% of the global newly reported cases and 8% of globally reported deaths since the start of the pandemic; with 26% of the global newly reported cases and 19% of the global newly reported fatalities in the last 7 day period. India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Bangladesh, South Africa, Iran, Israel, Indonesia, Spain, Germany, Chile, Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and Bolivia; their range of reported new cases is 1198 to 2595.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is virtually no change in average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 0.47%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is decreased by 5.5%.. The key question still remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artefact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: The SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 2 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mods.UBA/MPP]
