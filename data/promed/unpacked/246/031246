Key points and recommendations:
- There have been 2 human cases of _Echinococcus_ (tapeworm) infection acquired in northern New Hampshire; both patients presented with cystic lesions (that is, "cystic echinococcus") and reported exposure to dogs (definitive host) that were allowed to feed on raw organs/meat harvested from moose.
- There is emerging evidence [see ref. 2 below] that moose in northern New England carry this parasitic tapeworm and transmit the infection to dogs and other canids through ingestion of cysts from consumption of raw organ/meat of infected animals.
- Consider _Echinococcus_ in patients with unexplained cystic lesions in the lung, liver, and other organs; take care during surgical interventions to prevent cyst rupture because secondary seeding of daughter cysts and/or anaphylaxis can occur.
- Advise patients with exposure risk factors that their dogs should be routinely treated for tapeworms (de-wormed), avoid being fed raw offal or allowed to scavenge carcasses, and have fecal waste managed appropriately (e.g., do not use dog feces as fertilizer in gardens).

Background
On 11 Apr 2022, DPHS was notified of a confirmed case of human pulmonary _Echinococcus granulosus_ (EG) causing cystic echinococcus (CE). On 1 Dec 2022, a 2nd case of CE in an unrelated patient was confirmed. Both patients likely acquired infection in northern New Hampshire and reported the epidemiologic risk of dressing locally hunted moose and exposure to dogs, which can serve as a definitive host. These are the 1st identified cases of locally-acquired _Echinococcus_ in the state of New Hampshire.

In the United States, EG is a rare parasitic infection that has historically been identified in the Western and Midwestern states; however, EG has recently emerged in wildlife in the Northeast. In 2012, surveillance of the hunter-harvested moose population documented the presence of the parasite in Maine, but no human infection cases had previously been documented in New England.

EG is a zoonotic parasite. Adult tapeworms live in the intestine of canids (e.g., dogs, coyotes, and foxes). Canid feces contain parasitic eggs that are infectious to humans and other intermediate animal hosts (e.g., ungulates such as moose, deer, and sheep). In the intermediate host, the eggs hatch in the small intestine to form oncospheres which penetrate the intestinal mucosa and enter the circulation and then infect organs, especially the liver and lungs, where cysts form. Canids can become infected when they ingest raw flesh and viscera of an infected intermediate host.

Humans become infected when they ingest eggs that are shed in canid feces, usually through ingestion of raw produce contaminated by canid feces or through direct contact with infected feces. Ingesting meat infected with _Echinococcus_ cysts does not cause disease in humans.

Patients usually present when cysts are identified in a vital organ either incidentally or because the cysts are causing symptoms such as through mass effect. The incubation period is currently unknown, but may be years. Complications (such as anaphylactic reaction) can happen if the cyst ruptures either spontaneously or during surgical manipulation. Cyst rupture can also cause secondary seeding of daughter cysts in the infected person.

Prevention
Veterinarians and human healthcare providers should advise persons who hunt and dress moose and deer, or butcher sheep, of the following:
- Keep domestic dogs and wild canids away from raw ungulate viscera, including preventing dogs from scavenging carcasses.
- Dispose of all viscera in accordance with recommendations from [the state] Fish and Game Department [https://www.wildlife.state.nh.us/hunting/moose-game-care.html#disposal].
- Thoroughly cook all game meat that is fed to dogs.
- In consultation with a veterinarian, de-worm dogs using an agent which is effective against tapeworms (e.g., praziquantel) at a minimum of twice a year, and monthly in areas of elevated _Echinococcus_ risk.

Diagnosis and treatment
In patients found to have unexplained cystic lesions, assess for risk factors of exposure and obtain dedicated imaging. Note eosinophilia is not a consistent finding, and serologic tests for _Echinococcus_ have variable utility. Stool ova and parasite examinations are not helpful because the adult worm is only found in the intestines of the definitive canid host. Consult with an infectious diseases specialist who can help advise about diagnosis and management.

[ProMED rarely posts cases of echinococcosis, but the public health alert above is noteworthy not simply because these are the 1st known cases of locally acquired human echinococcosis in New England, USA, but also because of the suspected zoonotic link to moose as the original intermediate host. The bulletin is reprinted here virtually in its entirety because it also provides a useful refresher on the epidemiology and management of the disease in both animals and humans.

Although difficult to prove retrospectively, it is very possible that the source of parasitic infection in the reported cases was infected moose that were shot by these wildlife hunters, after which their dogs ingested hydatid cysts by feeding on the moose carcass offal during the initial kill site butchering process. Their human owners could have then acquired the infection, not by immediate exposure to the infected moose tissues, but only about 2 months later, because this is the time required for the ingested cysts to mature into adults worms in the small intestine of the dog, with the subsequent release of infective embryonated eggs in the dog feces. The dogs themselves may have appeared well since dogs rarely exhibit ill effects from tapeworm infection.

Further credence for this moose-dog-human transmission scenario is lent by the fact that _Echinococcus granulosus_ is by now quite prevalent in moose populations of the northern United States and Canada (1). In the state of Maine, which borders New Hampshire, a 2012 survey of moose killed by hunters found hydatid cysts in 21 of 54 lung sets examined, for a prevalence of 39% (2). Less is known about the prevalence of _Echinococcus granulosus_ in wild canine definitive hosts, namely wolves and coyotes. Coyotes but not wolves are found in the wild in New England, so it is also conceivable, albeit highly unlikely, that these hunters could have become infected by the accidental ingestion of coyote feces containing parasite eggs (in which case the human lung disease would have manifested itself earlier).
