The famous Gujarat saffron mangoes are under threat of an unknown disease due to which the mangoes are falling from the trees in several orchards. The crops have been infected with a white fungus in [Gir Somnath district], and spraying against it was not enough.

One grower said: "In the last 15 to 20 years, this year has been the worst. The saffron [mango] does not rest on the tree for a longer time and falls down very easily. The situation is serious as the production of mangoes is declining."

Another added: "Due to the disease, around 50% of the crop has gone. Mangos are infected with 4 or 5 diseases simultaneously. Medicines are also used, but there is no satisfactory result yet."

[Mango (_Mangifera indica_) is one of the most important fruits worldwide. A number of fungal and some bacterial diseases affecting the crop have been reported in the region, including anthracnose, mildews, leaf and stem blights, diebacks, and root rots. Many of these pathogens are favoured by humidity. Furthermore, wounds due to insects, weather, or other mechanical damage may provide easy entrance points for infection.

Since the problems above are attributed to multiple diseases occurring together, specific management strategies may be needed to address the different pathogens separately. Reliable diagnosis of all pathogens, as well as identification of potential additional external stress factors, will be essential.
