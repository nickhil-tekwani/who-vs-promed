A potato pest has been found in Novosibirsk
-------------------------------------------
The pest affected garden plots in 7 settlements and 126 hectares [311
acres] of crops on one farm. Inspectors from the Novosibirsk office of
Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary
Surveillance] have found potato cyst nematodes in 3 Novosibirsk districts,
namely Vengersky, Kishtovkiy, and Novosibirskiy. This information has been
announced by the Rosselkhoznadzor press service.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale
(_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in
potato. Other solanaceous crops and weeds may serve as pathogen reservoirs.
Symptoms on potato include stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as
well as a reduced root system. PCNs may lead to complete crop failure.
Diseased plants first occur in isolated patches and these become larger
with each new crop.

The nematodes can survive in soil for up to 20 years as cysts. Spread
occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on plant material. Disease
management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host species,
use of crop cultivars resistant to specific PCN races, and nematicides.
These control measures can be combined to keep nematode levels below
economic thresholds. Both PCNs have been included on the alert list of the
European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).

While pale PCN has never been reported from Russia and its immediate
neighbours, golden PCN is widely distributed in the Eurasian area. In
Russia, golden PCN was reported from the Kamchatka region earlier in 2009
(ProMED-mail post 20091005.3458), and previous PCN reports from other
widely spread out Russian areas were also considered likely to be golden
PCN. These detections may be due to central distribution of contaminated
seed potatoes in the past.
