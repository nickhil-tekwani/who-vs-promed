Five residents of Erkindyk village at Shet district [Karaganda/Qaraghandy] were taken to Karaganda-based regional infectious diseases hospital with rash.

"They were hospitalized for examination, in order to exclude highly infectious diseases, including anthrax. The results of laboratory tests will be ready within several days," Press Secretary of the regional healthcare department A Issa said.

[This report is iffy at best as the incidence of livestock anthrax has dropped to single outbreaks at worst, officially, with no recent outbreaks in swine, camels, a single horse in 2014 and 2010, no sheep or goats affected since 2006, and single bovine cases in 2012, 2011, and 2010. There is a very enthusiastic national vaccination program if the data provided to OIE is correct, with more vaccine doses distributed than heads of stock. And in the past anthrax was common in the west and east of the country and along the Kyrgyz border to the south, not in the central region. But what is known officially and locally are 2 different narratives. And as anthrax, like any disease, moves into the background less care is taken, vaccination is missed, and human cases can occur. 5 "cases" in a village would be typical if an infected carcass were butchered. Obviously laboratory confirmation is necessary.

Anthrax is most commonly reported from the western and eastern oblasts, but especially in the east and along the southern Kyrgyz border.
