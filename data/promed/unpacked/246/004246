Wasting disease found in 2nd elk
------------------------------
One of 41 elk from [an] elk ranch east of Meeker recently tested positive
for chronic wasting disease.
The neurological disease attacks the brains of infected animals, causes
them to become emaciated, display abnormal behavior, lose bodily functions
and die. At this time, there is no evidence that CWD is a risk to human
health, but it is a relative of mad cow disease and scrapie, which infects
sheep.
The 6-year-old cow elk died in June 2004. But Colorado Agriculture
Department spokeswoman Linh Truong said the sample wasn't submitted until
the agency's scheduled August [2004] testing.
A quarantine was placed on the herd of 40 animals after the positive test
result, she said.
Ranch owner Shane Phelan agreed to participate in a voluntary
indemnification program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, where each
animal was given an appraised value. Phelan could not be reached for
comment Monday.
In December [2004], the herd was transported to Colorado State University
in Fort Collins to be killed and tested for CWD. All 40 tested negative,
Truong said. There is no live test for the disease, so any suspect animals
are killed to be tested.
"This process was much longer than we expected, but we're glad that
everything progressed smoothly with all of the parties involved," said
state veterinarian Wayne Cunningham. "As with all cases involving
indemnity, the owner also agrees to not raise elk on that location for 5
years. We don't think there's any chance it spread outside the herd because
all of them were born at the ranch," Truong said.
Meanwhile, a second captive bull elk recently tested positive for CWD at
[another ranch] south of Hayden and northeast of Meeker.
In 2002, state wildlife officers killed 300 deer within 5 miles of [this
2nd ranch], after 2 deer shot inside a hunting pen tested positive for the
fatal brain ailment. 10 wild deer from the surrounding area also tested
positive. It was the 1st time the disease was found west of the Continental
Divide.
The 1800-acre ranch, has been under quarantine since 2002, when the 1st
bull elk tested positive. A management plan to determine how many, if any,
of the more than 200 captive elk at the ranch need to be killed is still in
the works, said Truong.
"We're getting input from the Division of Wildlife, CSU and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture," she said. "Once we're done and everyone's
agreed to it, that will determine how the ranch will be treated for the
next 5 years."
In Colorado, CWD testing has been required in all domestic elk deaths since
1998. Colorado was the first state to require mandatory surveillance of
domestic elk herds for CWD. In addition, Colorado's 97 licensed elk ranches
have been required to identify and inventory all domestic elk since July 1994.
2004's big game hunting season found CWD in only 135 animals (112 mule
deer, 3 white-tailed deer and 20 elk) out of 12 460 heads voluntarily
submitted for testing, according to the DOW's Web site. In 2003, 15,700
deer, elk and moose heads were submitted.
