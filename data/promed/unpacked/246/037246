The authorities in charge of animal health surveillance are on maximum alert after learning of information in which there is talk of a probable outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). This virus is not strange in La Guajira, as in the mid-2000s it affected a very large population of equines and also claimed the lives of many people.

The 1st to raise the alarm was [HP], a Wayuu native who posted on his Facebook account several photographs of dead animals, which generated the reaction of several veterinary professionals, such as the case of epidemiologist Carmelo Fuentes Julio, attached to the International Organization for Migrants (IOM) in its English acronym.

This professional indicated he had arrived in the area, observed several deceased equines and there is a high probability it was Venezuelan equine encephalitis, but he stated there is a need to carry out scientific procedures to be sure. [Confirmation testing is appropriate. - Mod.TG]

The sectional manager of the Colombian Agricultural Institute (ICA) Jaime Aragón Roys, told El Heraldo it is a very sensitive issue on which he has requested a little prudence on social networks and added once the news was known, it was sent to several professionals, veterinarians and zoo-technicians who are accompanied by the epidemiologist Melanio Cordero, whom he says is an authority on this matter.

The ICA manager indicated that on Tuesday [13 Dec 2022] they were taking blood samples from the dead animals and they will be sent to the institution's laboratory in Bogotá, which could guarantee no later than Friday of this week [16 Dec 2022] that they can inform the public whether it is equine encephalitis or another type of disease attacking animals on the border.

Aragón Roys also maintains it is almost unlikely the dead goats or sheep the networks are talking about died from encephalitis, as this disease is almost exclusive to equines.

The ICA official recalls about 7 years ago there was a massive death of sheep and goats associated with the disease known among the Wayuu indigenous people as carbon [meaning black, as anthrax can cause black tissue - Mod.TG] and they identified it as anthrax at that time.

With the massive death of goats and sheep, there was talk of the presence of anthrax, a disease which is very lethal for these species of small livestock and caused true terror among indigenous families when many saw their herds completely exterminated. [Please recall the anthrax outbreak in sheep and goats was 7 years previously and is not associated with VEE. - Mod.TG]

According to an ICA publication on 22 Mar 2022, the state institution had scheduled a vaccination day for various areas of La Guajira in order to immunize equines against Venezuelan equine encephalitis. This was corroborated by the local manager, who stated that they have applied 2500 vaccines against this virus.

["La Guajira is a department of Colombia. It occupies most of the Guajira Peninsula in the northeast region of the country, on the Caribbean Sea and bordering Venezuela, at the northernmost tip of South America. The capital city of the department is Riohacha.

"Various indigenous tribes have populated the arid plains of the region long before the Spanish expeditions reached the Americas. In 1498, Alonso de Ojeda sailed around the peninsula of La Guajira, but the1st European to set foot in what is known today as La Guajira was the Spanish explorer Juan de la Cosa in 1499. During the colonial era, the territory of La Guajira was disputed by the governors of Santa Marta and Venezuela, owing to deposits of pearls. English pirates, Frenchmen, and Germans also fought for control of the territory" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Guajira_Department).

While horses can become infected with anthrax, it is uncommon, just as it is uncommon for small ruminants to become infected with Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE). Furthermore, the anthrax reference was to 7 years previously.

"Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) is a viral, vector-borne disease in horses and humans in Central America, South America, Mexico and occasionally the southern United States causing inflammation of the brain. The VEE virus is related to the viruses causing Eastern and Western equine encephalitis.

"Eastern and Western equine encephalitis are typically spread from birds to horses by mosquito vectors, but are not transmitted between horses by mosquitoes. Conversely, if a mosquito bites a horse infected with VEE, there is enough virus in the blood it can be transmitted to another horse the mosquito bites. Rodents are the natural hosts for the VEE virus, but birds may be involved in some cases.

"Since aerosolized VEE can cause fatal encephalitis in humans, it is considered a possible bio-warfare agent.

"What are the clinical signs of Venezuelan equine encephalitis? The clinical signs of VEE include fever, anorexia, depression, weight loss, dehydration, weakness, paralysis, difficulty swallowing, gait abnormalities, seizures, and other neurological signs.

"How is Venezuelan equine encephalitis diagnosed? Venezuelan equine encephalitis is diagnosed through bloodwork. Testing can include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples to identify the virus.

"How is Venezuelan equine encephalitis treated? Treatment for VEE primarily includes supportive care such as intravenous (IV) fluids and anti-inflammatories.

"What is the prognosis for Venezuelan equine encephalitis? Horses that are infected with certain subtypes of VEE virus do not develop serious disease. Other subtypes can cause significant illness and death, with mortality rates as high as 90%.

"How can Venezuelan equine encephalitis be prevented? The American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) recommends the VEE vaccine based on a horse's risk of exposure. Venezuelan equine encephalitis is a reportable animal disease in the United States and cases should be handled accordingly.

"Good vector control with respect to VEE prevention can be challenging, as the disease is prevalent in areas with high rainfall and those susceptible to flooding, making it difficult to eliminate mosquito breeding areas of standing water. Aerosol insecticide applications are recommended when feasible" (https://ceh.vetmed.ucdavis.edu/health-topics/venezuelan-equine-encephalitis-vee). - Mod.TG]

[ProMED would greatly appreciate results of testing to confirm the suspected etiology of VEE. - Mod.MPP
