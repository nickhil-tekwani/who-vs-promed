Mikrocytosis (_Mikrocytos mackini_) in the United States of America
Emergency report
Information received on 18 Jul 2002 from Dr Peter Fernandez, Associate
Deputy Administrator, International Services, United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA), Washington, DC:
Report date: 18 Jul 2002.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 8 May 2002.
Estimated date of first infection: 1 May 2002.
Outbreaks:
Location: New Dungeness Bay, State of Washington
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: Pacific oyster (_Crassostrea gigas_).
Diagnosis:
A sample of 50 feral oysters contained 2 that were identified as positive
on cytological and histological examination for mikrocytosis. The 2 oysters
were feral in an oyster farming bay and estimated to be at least 5 years of
age. There was no report or sign of mortality or morbidity following
examination of the oysters in the bay. The survey examination of the
oysters was made as part of a routine surveillance effort. The infections
were very light in the 2 confirmed cases.
A. Laboratories where diagnosis was made:
- The cases were diagnosed on 8 May 2002 by AquaTechnics, Sequim, State of
Washington.
- Diagnosis was confirmed by the Pacific Biological Station, Canada.
B. Diagnostic tests used:
- Tissue imprints and histological examination.
- Research application of the PCR(1) method confirmed the tentative
diagnosis of the 2 histologically positive samples and confirmed the other
48 samples as negative.
C. Causal agent: _Mikrocytos mackini_.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: this is the first identification
of _M. mackini_ in the United States of America. Despite investigations,
the source of the introduction of the pathogen into the New Dungeness Bay
has not yet been identified.
B. Mode of spread: unknown.
C. Other epidemiological details: oysters from the nearby farm grown on
longlines have previously tested negative for _M. mackini_. These findings
are consistent with those in Canada where only older oysters grown on
bottom culture appear to become infected with _M. mackini_.
Control measures: currently, the movement of oysters from New Dungeness Bay
to other receiving waters is restricted by the Washington Department of
Fish and Wildlife.
(1) PCR: polymerase chain reaction.
