Staten Island Man Tests Positive for West Nile Virus
-----------------------------------------------------
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that
a 78 year-old Staten Island man has tested laboratory-positive for West
Nile virus. Serum and spinal fluid samples from the patient were received
by the New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) on 27 Jul 2000, tested
for West Nile virus, and reported as positive on 28 Jul 2000. Testing at
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was initially
equivocal on 30 Jul 2000, but repeat testing this past week was reported
positive on 3 Aug 2000. Additional confirmatory test results will be
available in another week. [Both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sera samples
were positive for IgM antibody by ELISA testing. Further confirmatory
testing by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT) for IgG antibody
in a convalescent serum sample is pending. - Mod.JW
The individual became ill with symptoms of meningo-encephalitis (fever,
dizziness, light-headedness) on 20 Jul 2000, and was admitted to a local
hospital on 22 July 2000. After one week in the hospital, the patient was
released and is now at home recovering.
Dr. Cohen said, "Symptoms of West Nile virus begin between 5 to 15 days
after being bitten by an infected mosquito, indicating that this individual
was infected before the City implemented its recent control efforts on
Staten Island. Our intensive, ongoing bird and mosquito surveillance
program documented significant West Nile viral activity on Staten Island in
mid-July, especially in the southern half of Staten Island where this
patient lives. Spraying was conducted on 19 Jul 2000 in response to those
early warnings, as well as follow-up spraying throughout Staten Island on 2
Aug 2000 as a precaution. In addition, more than 40 lakes, ponds, and
marshes on Staten Island received aerial applications of larvicide on 27 &
28 July 2000, and larviciding of catch basins is ongoing. The City will
continue to take action where necessary to reduce the mosquito population
and minimize the potential for additional human illnesses based on positive
surveillance findings in birds, mosquitoes, and humans.
"With this news of the City's first human case of West Nile virus this
year, and with the information we have received over the past few weeks on
the increasing numbers of dead birds confirmed to be infected with West
Nile virus in New York City, all New Yorkers, particularly those on Staten
Island and those more at risk for severe illness, especially the elderly,
should continue to take precautions against mosquitoes. In addition, I urge
all New Yorkers to help the City and each other to mosquito-proof New York
City by eliminating the areas of standing water where mosquitoes may
breed," Dr. Cohen said.
Staten Island Borough President Molinari said, "Our Helpline unit has
fielded nearly 1,500 calls, including reports of more than 500 dead birds
and over 200 standing water conditions."
For information on West Nile virus, spraying activities, or to report dead
birds and areas of standing water where mosquitoes may breed, New Yorkers
may call the NYCDOH's West Nile virus information line, 24 hours a day, 7
days a week, at 1-877-WNV-4NYC (1-877-968-4692).(New Yorkers who use
TTY/TDD can call 212-788-4947 weekdays from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.).

[It is potentially a problem that virus products have not been found in the
patient´s specimens by PCR test. Presumably the labs feel that the antibody
titers are sufficiently high to rule out unsuspected infection of the
patient in 1999. If there is a significant change in PRNT titer in the 2
successive samples now under test, then the case will be closed.
The first human cases of WNV infection in New York City in 1999 had onset
in the second half of August. This case with onset in the second half of
July indicates that human infection has got off to an early start in NYC
this year. We sincerely hope that the focal spraying efforts will succeed
in interrupting transmission. This is what happened in a European city
where there was no spraying:
(West Nile virus meningitis - Romania (2) 19960926121750).
>Rumania. As at 23 September [1996, a total of 450 cases of viral
meningitis had been reported in the outbreak which started in Bucharest at
the end of July [1996. The number of new cases has decreased in the past
week and the number of patients hospitalized fell from over 200 to 26
between 11 and 23 September [1996. More than half of the cases occurred in
adults and more than 200 were in people over 60 years of age. Thirty-nine
patients have died, most of them in the higher age groups. The WHO
Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Arboviruses and
Haemorrhagic Fevers at Pasteur Institute, Paris, France has confirmed
infection with West Nile virus in 89% of the patients... - Mod.JW
