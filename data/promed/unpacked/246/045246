NDA notified of pseudorabies infected wild pig
----------------------------------------------
Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) State Veterinarian Dr.
Dennis Hughes has been notified by the Nebraska Game and Parks
Commission of an investigation into a wild pig infected with
pseudorabies in the Genoa area. A wild pig that was killed by a
producer has tested positive for pseudorabies. NDA is currently
contacting producers in the area to alert them to the situation and
to advise them of symptoms and preventative measures.

A similar outbreak of pseudorabies was discovered in this area in early 2007.

Swine producers should be vigilant and watch for any of the symptoms
of pseudorabies in their animals. Symptoms include: respiratory
distress, nervous system signs (trembling, difficulty with
coordination, and paralysis), sudden death of your piglets, and
females aborting. Producers are asked to contact their local
veterinarian or NDA at 800-572-2437, if they notice these symptoms.
Producers can consider several options to avoid the disease,
including vaccinating stock, following strict biosecurity measures on
their farms, and minimizing contact with wildlife and rodents.

Further information on pseudorabies can be found at <http://www.agr.ne.gov>.

[For a full description of porcine pseudorabies (PRV) go to
ProMED-mail 20080508.1578 and read the moderator's comments. PRV is
an extremely contagious herpes virus. Despite its name, PRV is not
related to rabies, and it is not contagious to humans; however, other
animals and pets, particularly dogs, are susceptible to infection; it
can be lethal in dogs. Although the pig is the only natural host, the
virus can infect cattle, sheep, cats, dogs, and goats as well as
wildlife, including raccoons, opossums, skunks, and rodents.
Experimental studies in nonhuman primates indicate that rhesus
monkeys and marmosets are susceptible, but chimpanzees are not.
Reports of human infection are limited and are based on
seroconversion rather than virus isolation. Infections in horses are
rare. In wild pigs, as in this case, it presents a very significant
risk to stock and yet one more reason to severely cull wild and feral
pigs.
