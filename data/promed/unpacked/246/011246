A sanitary alert was declared in San Antonio Province, Valparaiso State,
after the Regional Secretariat of the Ministry of Health (SEREMI, according
to its Spanish initials) confirmed the occurrence of 6 cases of _Vibrio
parahaemolyticus_ gastroenteritis infection, and 61 additional persons who
ate raw shellfish apparently contaminated with the aforementioned bacterium
living in certain sea products were also detected.
According to Dr. Milton Egana, SEREMI representative for San Antonio
Province, pointed out that there are additional 60 persons suspected
because of eating raw shellfish in addition to the 6 confirmed cases. These
cases are being analyzed by the Public Health Institute, in order to
determine whether they have been infected by the microorganism.
When establishing the specific places where affected persons come from in
San Antonio Province, there are 7 affected persons in this port city, while
in El Algarrobo and El Tabo municipalities there are 7 and 5 affected
persons, respectively.
Most worrisome is what is happening in El Quisco resort -- there are 40
possible cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection, as reported by a local
radio station (Radio Digital FM).

Dr. Nestor Irribarra, from the Regional Secretariat of the Ministry of
Health (SEREMI, according to its Spanish initials), is concerned because of
the increasing number of persons intoxicated from eating raw shellfish. He
said that 360 cases have been reported, and 9 of them were confirmed to
have been caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_.
The first case of infection this season was reported 20 Nov 2006. Of the
360 reported cases, 69.5 percent (250) are men. With respect to age, 56.6
percent (98) are between 20 and 60 years old; 27.2 percent (47) are between
10 and 19 years old; 9.2 percent (16) are 60 years or older, and 6.9
percent (12) are children between 5 and 9 years old.
Municipalities which have the highest case toll are Quintero, 145; El
Quisco, 56; Valparaiso, 40; Puchuncavi, 22; San Antonio, 13; and Vina del
Mar and El Tabo, one case each.
Last summer, there were 411 cases of shellfish associated illness, 71
caused by _V. parahaemolyticus_. When comparing the overall figures with
the total case toll for the prior season, the current figure is 88 percent
of the amount reported last summer.
The most frequent causes of intoxication are eating raw clams and mussels
and failure in properly preserving the cold chain.

[Gastroenteritis due to _V. parahaemolyticus_ is generally transmitted
through raw or undercooked shellfish (especially oysters) but a variety of
seafood can be implicated. At this time of year (summer in Chile) in 2005,
more than 6300 seafood-linked cases of _V. parahaemolyticus_ occurred,
centered around Puerto Montt.
San Antonio Province is one of the 7 provinces of the Valparaiso Region of
Chile. It is formally known as "Quinta (Fifth) Region de Valparaiso",
following the traditional naming of regions from north to south. It is west
of, but on the same latitude as the capital city region of Santiago. A map
showing the location can be found at:
