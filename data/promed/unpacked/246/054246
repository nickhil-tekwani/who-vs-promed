Hundreds of pigs, chickens die of mystery illness in Indonesia's
West Timor
---------------------------------------------------
Excerpt from report by Indonesian newspaper Kupang Pos web
site on 6 Sep 2004
Atambua: Hu ndreds of pigs and chickens owned by Tohe Raiulun,
Aitoun and Raifatus villagers in Raihat subdistrict, Belu West Timor
died suddenly. Locals from the 3 villages do not know the cause of
death. A veterinarian carried out vaccinations [against what?]
without any positive results.
Maria Mau from Tohe village explained that the case of the dead
pigs began to spread since the middle of August 2004. She said
the animals were coughing and experienced a loss of appetite.
These symptoms usually occurred for 2 days before the pigs died.
"We panicked because the pigs died suddenly. Usually death
occurs in stages. If a family owns 5 pigs and they die first, [the
disease] then attacks the neighbours' [pigs]. We do not know
the name of this illness," said Maria.
Pigs are dying at an increasing rate. "Hundreds of pigs aged 3 to 4
years have died." Almost every day we hear of pigs dying. If this
continues we must bury them," said Maria. [A puzzling statement.
Why burying only if death continues?! - Mod.AS]
Lukas Mau Bau also from Tohe village told of a similar situation.
He said he thanks God the cattle have eluded the strange
epidemic, yet he still felt the loss of his pigs and chickens. "As a
farmer, our income is just enough [to live on]. We tend pigs and
chickens to earn extra income. If this is what it is like now, what
happens later? So far 60 of my chickens and 2 pigs have died.
This is just what I own, and does not include others from Raifatus
village. If you could count them, thousands of animals have
died," said Lukas.
Lukas explained that the epidemic attacking chickens in the region
began to spread at the beginning of September 2004. At the time,
the chickens' heads went black. In addition, their urine was white,
like a mix of lime and water.

[A confusing news item which needs substantiation and more data.
First, it is not certain at all that the reported disease and mortality in
pigs and chickens (in small holdings) have a common etiology.
Such conditions in pigs may be caused by various agents, both
infectious and non-infectious.
Second, since no human-health involvement has been mentioned,
Nipah does not seem to be the likely cause, though its possibility
should not be neglected, calling for early laboratory investigation.
Other possible infectious agents include Classical swine fever,
African swine fever, swine influenza, anthrax (more acute
symptoms might be expected), and others.
The reported black heads in chickens, obviou sly, bring to mind
histomoniasis ("Blackhead"). More information is urgently required.
