The State of Mato Grosso occupies first place in Brazil in cases of leprosy. In an alert of a serious public health problem, state deputy Dr. Eugênio de Paiva (PSB) indicated, during a plenary session on [4 Jan 2022], to Governor Mauro Mendes and to the Secretary of State for Health (SES), Gilberto Figueiredo, the urgent need to implement effective public policies, in partnership with municipalities, to reverse this situation.

"We are in the 'Purple January' (national campaign to combat, prevent and fight leprosy) and Mato Grosso carries the title of national leprosy champion. A state so rich in statistics that are so disastrous but they can be remedied with effective public policies to combat the disease. Leprosy is curable and the Unified Health System (SUS) covers the entire cost of treatment. Therefore, there is no reason for us to be record holders of sick people in the State of Mato Grosso", fired Dr. Eugênio, from the rostrum of the Legislative Assembly of Mato Grosso.

Dr. Eugênio, who is medically trained, warns that leprosy, when left untreated or treated late, causes disabilities/deformities. "Hands can be injured; eyes may not close; eyelashes may fall out; the nose can visually change; may have accentuated wrinkles; the ears may be modified; eyebrows may partially disappear; the foot may become paralyzed and have recurrent ulcer-like lesions (sores). These are consequences that can be responsible for the exclusion of many workers from the market and social life", explained the parliamentarian.

Dr. Eugênio highlighted the importance of the state government developing a task force not only for the treatment, but also for the prevention of the disease from the earliest stages. "It happens that negligence in prevention, not being diagnosed at an early stage, is what causes proliferation, since it is transmitted through drops eliminated in the air by coughing, speaking and sneezing of a person with leprosy, without treatment", punctuated Dr. Eugênio, in the alert to the state government.

Brazil is the only country in the world that has not reached the World Health Organization's leprosy elimination as a public health problem standard of one case per 10 000 inhabitants (https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/shorthanded-specialists-struggle-address-resurgence-leprosy-brazil). In 2020, Brazil (17 979 new cases) continued to be second to India (65 147 new cases) in number of new cases (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/leprosy). In the Americas in 2015, leprosy was reported in 24 countries, with more than 100 cases reported each year in the following countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, and Venezuela; but Brazil accounted for 94% of all cases in this region (https://www3.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=13657:lepra-en-americas&Itemid=40721&lang=en).

Brazil experienced a decline in new leprosy cases from 1993 until 2015, but according to Brazil's Ministry of Health, from 2016 to 2018, the number of new cases rose from fewer than 25 300 to more than 28 600 (https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/shorthanded-specialists-struggle-address-resurgence-leprosy-brazil). Then the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of many regular health services worldwide; this included leprosy control strategies in Brazil, as indicated in 2020 by a 41.4% fall in leprosy cases diagnosed compared to the average number of cases in the previous 5 years, a 56.8% reduction in leprosy notifications in children under 15 years-old and an 8.1% increase in the diagnosis of multibacillary leprosy (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(21)00177-0/fulltext).

Among Brazilian states, Mato Grosso has the highest prevalence and incidence rates for the disease (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8386686/).

Leprosy is transmitted from person to person by close contact. Elimination of leprosy depends on early case finding and immediate placement on multidrug antibiotic therapy. Once on drug treatment, patients are no longer contagious. The drug treatment for leprosy is free in Brazil. - Mod.ML
