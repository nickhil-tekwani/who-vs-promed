UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS, BUFFALO - PAKISTAN: (03)

There can be no doubt that the buffaloes concerned are Asian riverine
buffalo (_Bubalus bubalis_) which species has been domesticated for
millennia and provides a major element of dairy production in many
countries from South Asia to the Mediterranean region.

The origin of the wild progenitor species (_B. arnee_) was most
likely the area from Central India to southern Nepal in the west to
Viet Nam in the east. The closely related yet genetically distinct
swamp buffalo (also _Bubalus bubalis_) of South and South-East Asia
is used primarily for traction.

_Syncerus caffer_, the African or Cape buffalo, on the other hand,
extends as numerous sub-species native to a broad range of habitats
throughout sub-Saharan Africa, but apart from occasionally being
represented in zoological collections it is found nowhere outside
Africa. Unlike the Asian water buffalo, domestication attempts with
this species have proven unsuccessful.

More importantly I write on the subject of Pakistan's official status
with respect to rinderpest. It is correct to state that rinderpest
was last detected near Karachi in southern Pakistan in October 2000.
Subsequently in 2003, the Pakistan national authorities issued a
self-declaration of provisional freedom from rinderpest which was
published by the OIE. Since then demonstrated progress in
surveillance led OIE to grant Pakistan the status of freedom from
rinderpest infection, the final step of the then OIE Pathway
accreditation process. This remarkable achievement of progressing
from endemicity in 2000 to internationally-recognised freedom from
rinderpest infection was announced by OIE in May 2007 (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_peste.htm?e1d6>).

On the subject of deaths of buffaloes, although such heavy mortality
as was mentioned in the initial report is not highly suggestive, it
is necessary also to consider in the differential diagnosis the
Pasteurella multocid-associated syndrome which has some resemblance
to haemorrhagic septicaemia and is a major cause of attrition of
buffaloes in the Landhi and other dairy colonies near Karachi
(Hussain and Manzoor 2006). Even though the October 2000 rinderpest
outbreaks are considered by the Global Rinderpest Eradication
Programme to be the last to have occurred in Asia, rinderpest should
of course be ruled out by appropriate laboratory testing; until
global rinderpest freedom is announced with certainty in 2010
vigilance must be sustained to pre-empt any possible resurgence of
the disease. The National Veterinary Laboratory, in collaboration
with the National Agricultural Research Centre of the Pakistan
Agricultural Research Council, co-located in Islamabad, is capable of
undertaking the microbial analyses and could advise on the
availability of toxicological services.

It would be valuable to have a more technical account of what has
occurred. Journalistic reports can be wide of the mark and
considerably exaggerated in Pakistan as well as elsewhere.

[Indeed laboratory data would be helpful to determine if this was a
toxicosis or an infectious disease. There are clearly a number of
different issues that could/should be ruled out if more data were
available.

We are informed that samples from the dairy buffaloes in Landhi's
Cattle Colony are being collected and processed for Haemorhagic
Septicaemia (caused by _Pasteurella multocida_) and rinderpest
tests, as well as for investigations for poison/toxin in the feed
(the most probable cause of mortality). The sampling and testing are
collaboratively undertaken by the National Veterinary Laboratory, the
National Agricultural Research Centre and FAO experts, co-located in
Islamabad. Results are anticipated with interest.

Landhi cattle colony consists of approximately 2000 farms with a
total population of approximately 300 000 animals, of which 90
percent are Asian buffalos and furthermore a high number of free
ranging sheep and goats.

Unfortunately there seem to be no
internationally-obligatory mechanism requiring the notification of
mass-intoxications in food animals. Such a mechanism (to
involve national food-safety authorities?) would be instrumental in
preventing the exposure of consumers, within the affected country as
well as in external markets, to food-related hazards and will enhance
the withdrawal or retention of the relevant products if/when
prescribed. A recent example is the mass mortality in camels in Saudi
Arabia, suspected (unofficially) to be caused by the feed-additive
ionophore Salinomycin (see references). This event, allegedly
involving more than 5000 camels, has not been officially notified by
the Saudi authorities though camels are exported to other countries
and camel meat is widely consumed in the Middle East. No final
laboratory results, repeatedly requested by ProMED-mail, have become
available so far. - Mods.TG/AS]
