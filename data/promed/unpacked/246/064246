Dead croaker in Hampton linked to larger kills
-----------------------------------------------
Hundreds of dead croaker, that have washed up on the shore in
Hampton, Virginia this week [2nd week of September 2004], are
probably the latest victims of a mysterious disease that has killed
millions of the fish along the Atlantic Coast, from Florida to New
Jersey. A marine scientist says that he is almost certain that a
bacterial infection is to blame for the huge number of dead fish.

Hampton park rangers and aides spent much of Wednesday [8 Sep 2004]
scooping up the dead smelly fish from the shoreline at Buckroe Beach,
and Grandview Nature Preserve, and disposing of them, said Don
Leavenworth, senior parks manager. "We're just trying to keep the
beaches as clean as possible, and, at the same, time keep the stench
down," he said.

A Fort Monroe spokesman said that the Army also was dealing with a
large number of dead fish that recently washed ashore. All of the
dead fish are adult croaker, Leavenworth said. "Over the past couple
weeks, we would see maybe 3 or 4 over a section of beach. On
Wednesday [8 Sep 2004], it was like a thousand fish washed up," he
said.

The regional office of the state Department of Environmental Quality
has been monitoring the fish kill for the Virginia Institute of
Marine Science (VIMS) in Gloucester. "This fish kill appears to be
continuing," said Wolfgang Vogelbein, a scientist at VIMS. He hasn't
examined any of the croaker from the Hampton shoreline, but hopes to
very soon. "If anybody out there sees a dying fish, a fish that may
still be alive, I would love [it] if they could get [it] to me,"
Vogelbein said.

He suggests that a person who finds a croaker in this state put the
fish on ice, and get it to him as quickly as possible. "It's sort of
like a continuing detective story to try to figure this out,"
Vogelbein said.

Here is what is known: The 15 croaker Vogelbein examined in the last
4 weeks were from other locations in the Chesapeake Bay. They all
appeared healthy and relatively large. However, when the fish were
cut open, Vogelbein found evidence of excessive bleeding from the
gills in each fish. "I think a pathogenic bacterial infection is
killing these fish," he said.

While the disease may be tied to certain environmental factors,
Vogelbein said scientists haven't been able to identify those
factors. But, one possibility he mentioned was the tremendous
rainfall this summer [2004]. "In the 15 years I've been at VIMS, I've
never seen such a widespread croaker kill," he said. "It's probably a
mixture of environmental factors that is predisposing the fish to the
disease, and we may never see that again."

When Vogelbein has completed his research, he said that he will make
his report on the croaker kill available to the public through the
VIMS web-site.

[The extreme weather patterns lately play a huge role in the
environment of a number of creatures. The recent hurricanes have
disturbed both terrestrial and aquatic patterns. Hopefully, Dr.
Vogelbein will be able to determine the case and post it shortly. For
this article, it is impossible to speculate further as to the cause
of the die-off. - Mod.TG]
