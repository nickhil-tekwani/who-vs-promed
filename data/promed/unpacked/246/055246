So far 5 patients at Valley Regional Medical Center have been
diagnosed with viral meningitis after they were admitted to the hospital
last week complaining of severe headaches and fever. Viral meningitis
is a less severe form of meningitis than bacterial, which has a higher
mortality rate and more severe symptoms. The viral form is rarely fatal
for people with normal immune systems, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
"It's an unusual amount that we're seeing at the hospital right now,"
said Dr. Robert Lozano, a Brownsville neurologist. "We're a little
concerned about it. I've been practicing here 10 years, and I have never
seen a peak like this." One of the unusual features of the cases is that
they involve 2 sets of family members, Lozano said. "Usually, whole
families don't get it," Lozano said. Lozano said the patients are expected
to recover fully.

[The diagnosis does not identify a specific virus as the etiologic agent.
Various enteroviruses have been associated with meningitis in the past,
but other viruses are not excluded. The early timing of this outbreak
(enteroviruses tend to peak in their activity in the late summer and early
fall in the USA) and the concern raised by the neurologist starts one to
think of some other alternative diagnoses. For example: Why does
West Nile virus spring into my mind (a left-field diagnosis)? (In the
WNV outbreaks in Romania in recent years have presented as virla
meningitis -- see refs below. - Mod.JW) While WNV has not been
reported in Texas as yet, it doesn't mean it hasn't managed to "sneak in
the back door". And there are other encephalitis viruses that have been
active in neighboring states (Eastern equine encephalitis and WNV
have been active in Louisiana). It's curious that there have been "sets
of family members" involved as well, because the "usual suspects" do
not tend to cluster in families. More information on this outbreak
would be very much appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
