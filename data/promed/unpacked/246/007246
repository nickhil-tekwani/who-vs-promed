[This outbreak seems to be restricted to backyard-type poultry. The
1995 outbreak started that way and then spread to Sweden's
largest broiler parent stock farm. This is the worst-case scenario,
most likely worse than establishment in backyard flocks, as
happened in California. Spread to large commercial or breeding
farms is unlikely to happen here, but the possibility is certainly a
concern for animal health officials. - Mod.PC]
