Voronezh Oblast: trichinellosis (8 cases)
-----------------------------------------
A man was admitted into Ternovskiy hospital with fever, rash over the body
and muscle pain. Physicians suspected rubella and started to treat
accordingly. However, the treatment had no effect and soon after, 7 more
patients arrived, all from the same family.

Doctors were surprised when trichinellosis was confirmed, because it is a
rare disease that had not been reported before [in this area]. Now all
patients are being treated in Voronezh.

Antonina Sayapina, the epidemiologist of the local hospital, informed that
the source of infection are game animals. The head of the family, an avid
badger hunter, salted and smoked the meat and treated his family.

The head of the local hunters' association reported that badgers are being
hunted mainly because of their fat. One animal yields about 4-5 kg [9-11
lb] of highly valued fat, which is considered to have healing powers. He
added that badger's fat is certified, that nobody controls the quality and
safety, or tests which diseases it cures. However, hunters earn much on it.
It is unknown how many infected badgers live in the area. Apart from
badgers boars and many other wild and domestic animals carry this infection
and it is necessary to take precautions, particularly because the hunting
season is in its peak.

[Trichinella is not located in fat of the animal, and as stated above, the
meat is used for human consumption. Smoking is often not an efficient
method for sterilizing meat for trichinella. - Mod.EP
