Dozens of prisoners of the Boniato prison in Santiago have been transferred because of cholera to the Ambrosio Grillo Hospital, where the 8 wards are occupied by patients with the disease, according to dissidents and employees of the health center. "All the wards at the Ambrosio Grillo Hospital are full," said a nurse.

Activists from the island's Oriente region have reported in recent days that the Government is hiding a strong resurgence of cholera, which occurred after the passage of hurricane Sandy [25 Oct 2012]. "Do we have (cholera)? All the wards are filled," said a nurse of the Ambrosio Grillo Hospital in statements to Radio Marti.

Members of the opposition Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) have denounced in recent days that cholera has spread to several locations in Santiago de Cuba Province. Also, "cases have been recorded in the municipalities of Imias, Baracoa, Yateras, Maisi, and San Antonio del Sur," of Guantanamo Province, said the leader of the organization, a former political prisoner, citing reports from one of the activists, who said that last week [week of 12 Nov 2012] there were about 68 cases in the Guantanamo Agostinho Neto provincial hospital.

In statements published by Radio Marti, another UNPACU member said that the Ambrosio Grillo Hospital, in the Santiago province locality of El Cobre, is guarded by "prison guards, who use gloves and have their mouths covered."

"Yesterday night [18 Nov 2012] 4 guaguas [minibuses] and 8 ambulances from the Boniato prison moved to the Ambrosio Grillo (...) 240 prisoners with cholera. These prisoners are in very poor condition and are reported as 'serious', the activist said. However, a nurse, wife of a political prisoner detained in Boniato, gave a more moderate figure. She said that the prison is "back on quarantine", so she could not visit her husband, who suffers from diarrheal episodes. "There are 115 prisoners with cholera in the medical post at the Boniato prison, and there are 79 in Grillo [Hospital]," she said. Another nurse, who was admitted with cholera in the Ambrosio Grillo Hospital from 12-15 Nov 2012, described the hygienic conditions in the hospital as "deplorable". "There is no water for bathing, the bathroom is full of excrement, there are even bedpans filled with excrement in the hallways," she said. "In ward B, the women couldn't even wash our mouths because there was no water, even for drinking, and they would not let us bring water from home for precautionary measures. I do not know how they are going to combat cholera with such bad hygiene," she added according to the Miami radio station. The nurse said that some 40 people are admitted daily to the hospital, to which confirmed cases are sent.

Regarding the presence of the disease in Guantanamo, the internet site Cubanet reported on a meeting of business and state agencies about the difficult health situation of the province, where some 60 cases of cholera have been reported.

[It is not clear if the Cuban government has acknowledged the reports of recurrent cholera in several eastern provinces. Santiago de Cuba Province was the area where most of the cases of _Vibrio cholerae_ infections had occurred in July and August 2012.

An event causing substantial flooding such as a hurricane often will cause an outbreak of cholera and other enteric diseases if the sewage/sanitation systems are not adequate. In parallel, increased standing water in warm climates will cause an increase in the mosquito population and cause an upswing of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue. - Mod.LL
