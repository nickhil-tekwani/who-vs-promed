[According to the report submitted to the OIE, Portugal indicates there were a total of 63 susceptible birds (18 chickens (not broilers), 36 broilers, 6 guinea fowl, and 3 ducks), but the total number of cases is unknown. See report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_imm_0000014480_20131203_172835.pdf

Although information obtained from EMPRES (FAO Emergency Prevention System) does not provide the total number of susceptible animals (birds), it reports the number of cases as 54 chickens, 18 guinea fowl, and 3 ducks. (EMPRES's source was from the European Commission); http://empres-i.fao.org/eipws3g/#h=0

Both sources of information report that all animals were destroyed. It would, however, be useful if the number of susceptible animals and cases could be reconciled between the 2 reports.

The OIE's Terrestrial Code defines "case" as follows: "case, means an individual animal infected by a pathogenic agent, with or without clinical signs"; http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=glossaire.htm

The LPAI serotypes identified previously by Portugal (2007) were H5N2 and H5N3 (see reports
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=6218, http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=6655, and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=6720).
