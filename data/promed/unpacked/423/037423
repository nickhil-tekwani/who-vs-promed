Health officials in Scotland are urging the public to be aware of the
symptoms of botulism after 2 members of the same family were
hospitalised with an illness which is now thought likely to be the
intoxication. Health Protection Scotland (HPS) said the pair remained
in a stable condition. HPS has notified clinicians and has so far
received no reports of any further suspected cases.

Investigations are continuing into the possible cause, but botulism is
often food-borne. Botulism is caused by toxins produced by the
bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, which attacks the nervous system
and can affect people of any age. The infection is not contagious and
cannot be spread from person to person. Symptoms of food-borne
botulism typically begin between 12 and 36 hours after ingestion of
contaminated food, but may become apparent in as little as 6 hours.

Dr John Cowden, consultant epidemiologist at HPS, said: "Botulism is
rare in the UK. Symptoms are a combination of blurred vision,
difficulty swallowing and difficulty speaking -- which rapidly get
worse, followed by general muscle weakness. Any person, child or
adult, with these symptoms should seek urgent medical advice.
Antitoxins have proved very effective in treating the condition."

[ProMED awaits more information regarding the source of the botulinum
toxin in these 2 linked cases. It is likely that the source was a
home-prepared food but more information is required. - Mod.LL]
