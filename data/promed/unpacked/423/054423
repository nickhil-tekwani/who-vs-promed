Livestock farmers at the Maasai Mara ranches have claimed that they have
lost more than 400 head of cattle in the last 2 months, to an incurable
disease. The cattle, the farmers claimed, is estimated at more than Sh 600
000 (US$8100).
The deadly disease is normally spread by wildebeests when calving. The
farmers said they lose a similar number of cattle every year. They appealed
to the Government to drive away thousands of wildebeests that are currently
occupying the Mara ranches. They told reporters in Naikara area of the Mara
region, that with the impending migration of the beasts from Serengeti
National Park in Tanzania to the Maasai Mara National Reserve mid next
month, they might lose more cattle.
The migration kicks off the tourist peak season in the reserve. The
farmers, led by Paul Olelepore and Kamatia ole Masharia, of Siana Lodge and
Olderkesi ranches respectively, said as the current drought persists, the
wildebeests are forced to compete with cattle for pasture, hence the spread
of the disease.
"We do not blame the Government for the loss since there is no cure for the
disease, but we urge it to help us drive the wildebeests from the grazing
fields," they said. The farmers also urged the Government to prevail upon
the Tanzanian authorities to curb the spread of the disease, by allowing
them to graze their cattle across the common border, when the wildebeests
cross into the country.
However, the Narok District Livestock Officer, Mr David Wekesa, disputed
the figures of the cattle that might have died of the disease. He urged the
farmers to avoid the areas where the wild animals normally calve.

[Martyn Edelsten <Martyn.Edelsten@ED.AC.UK> reminded me that this is
presumably malignant catarrhal fever. It is an inapparent infection of
black (and blue?) wildebeest. MCF is caused by Alcelaphine herpes virus
group I, and the virus is excreted at parturition. Cattle infected by
contact with wildebeest or infected placentae. Indigenous and exotic cattle
susceptible. Normally sporadic cases in cattle. Case mortality approaches
100%. Vertical and horizontal transmission occurs in wildebeest herds with
all calves infected within first few months of life. There is no vaccine.
Nothing to do except keep cattle away from wildebeest or vice versa!
