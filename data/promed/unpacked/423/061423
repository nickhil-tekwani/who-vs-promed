Vigilance is being urged by Airedale Beekeepers Association after an outbreak of a highly-infectious honeybee disease.

This spring [2016], 3 instances of American foulbrood (AFB) have been reported in the Micklethwaite area [West Yorkshire, England].

The bacterial disease is spread by bees coming into contact with honey products, usually imported ones. It is not dangerous to humans and doesn't affect honey quality, but it kills bee larvae and requires the immediate destruction of affected hives to prevent further spread.

Association chairman, Sue Chatfield, said: "AFB is a devastating disease for honey bees and one that is so serious the Government bee inspector will impose quarantine and require all affected colonies to be destroyed.

"The public can help by being aware of the potential for AFB to spread through bees coming into contact with commercial honey products.

"Bees are highly attracted to the smell of honey -- even indoors -- and people can assist by ensuring they don't leave any honey uncovered, particularly during warm weather."

[American foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming Gram-positive bacterium. AFB is a severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honey bees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.
