CDC has been notified by multiple states of patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza (primarily influenza B virus infection) who also have morbilliform (i.e., maculopapular) rash; testing for measles infections in these patients has been negative.

While the number of these cases has been small so far, influenza B virus cirulation is increasing in many regions of the country, and there is some concern that cases of influenza B-associated rash may also increase over the next several weeks. The clinical significance of this syndrome is not yet clear. Rash is an uncommon complication of influenza and a very rare complication of influenza B virus infection.

We are requesting your assistance to identify cases and gather information on this clinical syndrome. Currently, we are defining cases as children and adults in the United States who meet the following 4 criteria:

- Presence of morbilliform rash
AND
- Negative measles testing (by IgG, IgM antibody serology or RT-PCR test) AND
- Laboratory-confirmed influenza (by rapid diagnostic test, fluorescent antibody, enzyme immunoassay, RT-PCR test, or viral culture)
AND
- Onset of both rash and influenza-like illness on or after 1 Oct 2014.

If you identify a patient who may meet this case definition, please notify CDC's Influenza Division so that additional information can be collected. We suspect that cases are most likely to be identified from specimens at the state public health laboratory that have been tested for measles and were found to be negative. Please consider testing all measles-negative specimens at your state public health laboratory for influenza virus by RT-PCR testing. We would consider any of these specimens that test positive for influenza virus to be potential cases in this investigation and would then request your assistance with obtaining information from these patients on their clinical syndrome and risk factors for illness.

Please share this letter with your state's vaccine preventable disease (VPD) coordinator so he or she is aware of this investigation. Your VPD coordinator may also have additional thoughts on case-finding for this unusual presentation of influenza.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Grace Appiah in CDC's Influenza Division at ydg3@cdc.gov or 404-483-9543.
