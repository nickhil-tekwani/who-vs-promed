Moderator AS included the comment:

"The information on mortality in cattle and sheep, though relatively small, is indicative of the clinical effect of this epizootic, on top of the serologically detected cases, which are probably, the majority of the reported cases."

I assume this is based on the OIE report figures.

Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 24 258 / 211 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 2356 / 10 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep and goats / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

However, from my reading of this, there is no mortality (the 4th number), rather an indication of a single animal destroyed.

The referenced OIE report with 140 outbreaks dated from 21 Aug 15 to 22 Dec 15 seems to show no deaths and 1 animal, a sheep, destroyed on the 1st detected/reported outbreak.

The clinical effect would depend on overall morbidity as much as mortality. Of the susceptible population on the affected locations, it seems that less than 1 percent have been infected. Presumably many tested/surveilled locations have not been infected. The OIE reports by their nature exclude the important information on negative results, making an assessment of impact hard to determine. That doesn't mean that I think bluetongue is unimportant, just that I would be wary of drawing such a conclusion from the data in the OIE reports.

The "sheep and goats" figure is interesting. It comes from 2 reports, one location of 161 susceptible animals with no cases (there was 1 case in cattle at the same location) and a 2nd at another location (different commune, albeit not very far away) with no susceptible animals but 1 case.

Also, surely it is time that sheep and goats are always reported separately, not sometimes together? They share some but by no means all diseases.

[The current summary of the event since its start (21 Aug 2015), as presented in WAHID's archive updated 5 Jan 2016, is the following:

Total outbreaks = 143 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Cattle/ 24 512/ 214/ 0/ 0/ 0
Sheep/ 2356/ 10/ 0/ 1/ 0
Sheep & goats/ 161/ 1/ 0/ 0/ 0

The said summary, including a map showing the locations of the 143 accumulated outbreaks, is available at
http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019453_20160105_191002.pdf.

Dr Honhold's correction is right, and I apologize for the oversight; indeed no mortalities have been reported since the start of the event to present. ProMED-mail's commentary of 5 Nov 2015 (archived 20151105.3769159), indicating that "the clinical impact of this BTV-8 event, which affected mainly cattle, few sheep and no goats, is rather minimal: apparent morbidity rate of 0.54 per cent; no mortality at all," remains valid. The current apparent morbidity figures, for cattle and sheep are 0.87 and 0.42 percent respectively, and indeed there is no mortality.

The application of the term "sheep & goats" in the OIE epidemiological reporting system was dictated by the fact that in some countries sheep and goat are held in common flocks without numerical differentiation. Indeed this causes some confusion, but reflects reality.

On 5 Jan 2016, the OIE published France's follow-up report No 17, notifying 3 new outbreaks in cattle holdings in 3 departments: Yonne (140 susceptible animals/ 1 case), Puy-de-Dome (35/1) and Isre (79/1). As in all previous reports pertaining to the continuing BTV-8 event in France, the "Manifestation of disease" is indicated as "Clinical disease". The report is available, with a map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=19453.

The 2nd assessment of DEFRA on the French BTV-8 event, published 7 Nov 2015, said, "...where a positive [tested] farm has been identified, in the majority of cases only 1 [cow] tested positive out of the 60 sampled. In addition, report cases are made as part of the passive surveillance programme in France, where animals showing clinical signs suggestive of notifiable disease are followed up. The number of monthly reports has significantly increased, showing the increased awareness of farmers and vets." (see 20151107.3773821 or the original at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/471263/poa-update2-btv8-france.pdf).

The identification of just 1 single positive animal among the 60 lab-tested (per holding), raises the question of whether clinical BTV-8 disease is currently seen in France. Did the 3 cases in cattle -- reported in the above follow-up report from 3 holdings -- demonstrate clinical BT signs? - Mod.AS
