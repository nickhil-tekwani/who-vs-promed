Rare disease hits oilseed rape crops
-------------------------------------
A rarely seen disease of oilseed rape has been identified in a number
of crops this spring [2008]. Patches of plants with severe
_Phytophthora_ root rot (_Phytophthora megasperma_) have been
confirmed in several crops on sites with heavy, wet soils, says
oilseed rape disease expert Dr Peter Gladders.

The main symptoms are purple discolouration of plants and stunted
growth. In some cases the entire root system has completely rotted
away and plants can be easily pulled from the soil. _Phytophthora_
root rot (PRR) is also occurring at some sites in combination with
clubroot, which also favours wet, poorly drained soil conditions, and
symptoms can be confused.

"You tend to see PRR in small patches. Some plants will be dying now.
There is also a phase where plants will continue growing and form
pods but will ripen prematurely and set no seed," said Dr Gladders.
At the disease levels being seen, yield losses are unlikely to be
high. He said disease development may have been exacerbated by
weather patterns over winter.

There was nothing growers with affected crops could do at this stage
to control the disease. His advice was to check patches of poor
growth or purpling and identify the cause. Where clubroot is present,
patches should be mapped and soil tested both within and outside of
the patches so that differential lime applications can be made where
appropriate.

Farmers battle canola fungus
----------------------------
Edmonton-area canola farmers are anxiously checking the spring
weather forecasts as they battle a fungus that's already infested 10
municipalities. Spring weather is critical to the speed of clubroot's
spread. A cool, wet spring will help activate the spores, while dry
weather will give producers some breathing room to work at keeping it
at bay. "It could be one the biggest threats we've ever had to our
oilseed industry," said Rod Scarlett (Wild Rose Agricultural
Producers). Many farmers have switched from grains to canola in
recent years to take advantage of high prices, Scarlett said.

Even a dry spring won't help the close to 200 fields known to be
infested. They won't be able to grow canola at a time of record
prices. There are no current fungicides for canola clubroot, which is
most often carried from field to field on tillage equipment. A
government-producer committee formed last year [2007] recommends
canola not be grown for 3 years in slightly infested and 5 years in
severely infested fields. It would also like unaffected farms to grow
canola once every 4 years, constantly clean their equipment, and
restrict access to fields. The committee said clubroot has the
potential to hit all Western Canada's traditional canola growing areas.

Oilseed specialist Murray Hartman said it's likely more widespread
than current numbers show, because areas adjacent to infested
municipalities have not yet been surveyed. Canola grower Greg Porozni
said responsible producers will be diligent, but some might be
tempted to cheat. "Not being able to grow canola affects their
livelihood." He believes the full economic effect of clubroot won't
be known until next year [2009] or 2010.

The fungus affects the quality of the canola, and the resting spores
can survive in soil for up to 20 years. It took 17 years to get rid
of clubroot in rapeseed in Sweden some years ago. Researchers at the
University of Alberta and at agri-business companies are developing
clubroot-resistant canola lines.

[The fungus _Phytophthora megasperma_ is a diverse species
encompassing a wide range of morphological and physiological types.
It is found worldwide causing diseases on a broad range of fruit and
nut crops, vegetables, legumes, forest trees, woody and herbaceous
ornamental, and may also cause root girdling rots on oilseed rape.
Species in the genus _Phytophthora_ often have a narrow host range
and many cause serious crop diseases. However, host-specific
pathogenicity appears to be less common among isolates of _P.
megasperma_ some of which can affect a range of different hosts.
Report [1] above does not specify if the infection in oilseed rape is
thought to have originated from, for example, contaminated soils or
other plant hosts.

Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus _Plasmodiophora
brassicae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease which affects
nearly all cultivated, as well as many wild and weed members of this
family. The pathogen is found worldwide and is most damaging in
temperate regions and tropical highlands. The fungus enters root
hairs and wounded roots, and multiplies rapidly, causing abnormal
enlargement of the underground stem, taproot, or secondary roots.
These roots often decay before the crop has matured, releasing many
resting spores, which can survive for a decade in the absence of a
susceptible host plant. Affected plants are stunted and may have
discoloured purple leaves. Due to the distortion of the root, plants
may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores
and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides.
Raising soil pH by addition of lime has been shown to be effective
but is hardly practicable on large fields. Use of clean planting
material is essential. The pathogen is composed of numerous
pathotypes which have hampered efforts to breed cultivars with
durable resistance. At least 2 prevalent clubroot pathotypes have
been reported in Alberta, and a new more virulent strain of the
pathogen appears to have emerged recently.

Canola is a trademarked quality description of a group of cultivars
of oilseed rape variants from which low erucic acid rapeseed oil and
low glucosinolate meal are obtained. Canola was initially bred in
Canada in 1978 and the word was derived from "CANadian Oil, Low Acid."
