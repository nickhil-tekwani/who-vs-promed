[Chikungunya cases were first reported from Karachi in December 2016, spreading to various town areas of the city in the ensuing weeks and months. As Karachi has warm and humid weather nearly throughout the year, only rigorous implementation of sanitation control and vector elimination measures can have an impact on bringing down the case numbers for chikungunya and dengue as the vector continues to find a conducive environment. - Mod.UBA
