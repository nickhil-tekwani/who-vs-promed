DRC - Local sources warn that the Ebola epidemic is not over
------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola [virus disease] epidemic that has killed more than 30 people in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is not yet over and is still killing according to local religious sources to the missionary news agency (MISNA).

"I would like to tell you that the Ebola epidemic is over, but we still do not see an end," said a missionary in Orientale province in a report received by MISNA. Last week [week of 8 Oct 2012], only one case was detected but "since then a young woman with all the symptoms of Ebola hemorrhagic fever died near Isiro," the correspondent added.

The latest report of the World Health Organization (WHO), in mid-September [2012], recorded 31 deaths. Since then there have been 3 others, according MISNA. "The group most affected are nurses and health workers, at least until appropriate protective measures were implemented" by the Ministry of Health, WHO, and the humanitarian organisation Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), said the missionary.

The correspondent notes that one of the main problems to confront the epidemic is that "many people avoid hospitals and health facilities for fear of contracting the infection or be isolated." Under these conditions warns the correspondent; "there is a risk that possible new cases of the disease are not being identified." WHO believes that the epidemic has peaked, but has warned that "it is necessary to be vigilant because the descent phase has not yet begun and the virus has not yet been completely controlled."

Furthermore there is a sense of insecurity prevailing in the neighbouring province of North Kivu, and in the east of the country. Thousands of IDPs [internally displaced people] are complicating the containment measures and provision of humanitarian assistance.

WHO and the UN have called for international aid of USD 2 million (1.5 million euros) to combat the epidemic, "a burden that countries, such as the DRC, are unable to carry out alone," said the local WHO representative, Dr Leodegal Bazira, according to the MISNA report.

[As commented in the previous report from the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is still a lack of clarity about the extent of the Ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the precise number of confirmed and suspected cases. Further information is still awaited.
