Ontario has its 1st case of clubroot disease in canola, and further testing has confirmed it in canola across the province. Meghan Moran, Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) [said]: "Treat it with respect, and really focus on reducing spread to other fields."

Clubroot has been found in Ontario in cole crops, but this is the 1st time it has been diagnosed in canola. The oilseed is grown in northern Ontario; vegetable crops are not grown on a large scale in the same area. Clubroot has been found in canola in Western Canada since the early 2000s.

OMAFRA undertook a survey [of] 95 samples from northern and southern Ontario. It found 8 positive fields in the northern and 3 in the southern group. The next step, currently underway, is to determine pathotypes. This will determine whether the Ontario disease is the same as western Canadian strains, whether clubroot-resistant varieties will have an effect, and even whether the same strains are present in different areas in Ontario.

Moran doesn't believe much will be gained trying to figure out how the disease got to Ontario. It's better to dedicate energy to preventing its spread, she said.

[Clubroot of _Brassicaceae_ is caused by the fungus-like organism _Plasmodiophora brassicae_. It is a destructive soil-borne disease affecting nearly all cultivated members of the family, including oilseed rape (_Brassica napus_; "canola" refers to a group of specific varieties), cabbages and turnips, as well as many wild species, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It is found worldwide and is most damaging in temperate regions and tropical highlands.

The pathogen enters root hairs and wounded roots. It multiplies rapidly causing abnormal enlargement of the underground stem, taproot or secondary roots ("clubs"). Affected roots often decay before the crop has matured. Depending on the timing of infection in the crop cycle, symptoms may include wilting, stunting and yellowing of plants, or premature ripening resulting in shrivelled seeds. Due to the distortion of the roots, plants may wilt in dry weather and then recover at night.

Decaying roots release many resting spores, which can survive in the soil for a decade or more in the absence of a susceptible host plant. The disease can be spread with soil (for example on agricultural machinery), farming activities and infected plant debris. Use of clean planting material and phytosanitary measures to prevent spread between fields is essential. Disease management is difficult due to the longevity of the spores and the inaccessibility of underground plant parts to fungicides. Raising soil pH by addition of lime and experimental fumigation treatments have been shown to be effective (see ProMED-mail post 20120521.1139354).

The species is composed of numerous pathotypes which makes breeding crop cultivars with durable resistance difficult. In Canada, several of the pathotypes are known to occur. A new resistance-breaking strain is currently emerging in Alberta (ProMED-mail post 20150618.3447106).
