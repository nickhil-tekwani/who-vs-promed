In his evidence at the BSE Inquiry on 3 June, James Ironside was asked to
give what amounted to an account for non-scientists of the Delphia assay.
The evidence transcript is as follows.

MR WALKER: Dr Ironside, just before we broke we had been talking about
different forms of analysis. One other form of expression that I have come
across is the Delphia assay. Can you explain what the Delphia assay
involves?
DR IRONSIDE: Yes, this is a form of assay that has really been developed
by Dr Hope in the Institute of Animal Health in Compton. It involves
using, again, antibodies to prion protein in a very sensitive
fluorescence-based assay which can detect very very small quantities of PrP
in tissues. It is again in tissues which have been homogenised. It is
still under development, and it is one particular system of analysis that
we wish to set up in the CJD unit once the development is complete. We are
already under negotiation with Dr Hope and the manufacturers to do this in
the very near future.
MR WALKER: What particular advantages will the Delphia assay give?
DR IRONSIDE: The main advantage of it is its sensitivity to detect very
small quantities of prion protein that probably cannot be detected by other
the western blotting technique or immunocytochemistry, because both of
these have thresholds of detection. The Delphia system, because it is much
more sensitive, can detect much smaller quantities of tissue, and some of
the work Dr Hope has done will enable its use on human tissues. We wish to
use this technique on tissues that we have investigated to look at the
question of distribution of potential infectivity in other tissues where we
cannot detect anything by immunocytochemistry, so this will give us more
information, and will give us more sensitive information on where the
abnormal protein is.
PROFESSOR FERGUSON-SMITH: Is there any hope that it might be used, for
example, in peripheral lymphocytes, for example from a blood sample? We do
not know that, I gather, yet?
DR IRONSIDE: We do not know that. I know that we are collaborating with
people in the Blood Transfusion Service in Scotland, Dr Tanner and his
colleagues, and they have used the system to detect the normal form of the
protein in peripheral blood cells, when it is present in both lymphocytes,
I think, and also platelets. Whether the same will apply to the abnormal
form of the protein is not certain. One of the difficulties here, again,
is the limitations of the current antibodies that we generally have
available because, as I said, they will detect both the normal and the
abnormal form of the protein, and the only way of differentiating that is
to use proteinase K to digest. Now if that is done on blood cells, it may
well disrupt the cells.
PROFESSOR FERGUSON-SMITH: So you would want to have specific monochrome
antibodies that will recognise particular epitopes on the [antigen]?
DR IRONSIDE: That is absolutely correct. There is one antibody which has
been produced in Switzerland which seems to be able to do this, and we have
a European-Union-funded collaboration with that group, and also with the
group in Germany. That project is just in the final stages of contract
negotiation with the European Union, and we hope to move ahead on that one
fairly soon.
