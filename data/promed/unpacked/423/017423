[From the previous posting:
>... rabies, which needs to be treated within 48 hours of an animal bite for
the victim to stand any chance of survival...
>The message we put out is if you are as much as licked by a possibly rabid
animal it is the end of your holiday.]
In a situation like this, it would be better for journalists to provide more
factual and practical information for the public, such as telling them where
to go or who to call if exposed, instead of instilling fear. I would hate
for anyone to forego vaccination because they didn't make the false "48 hour
deadline," or stop their holiday because of being licked by a dog. People
should have a number to call to obtain reliable information, wound
treatment, and medications-vaccination (if needed).
According to Mandell, Douglas, & Bennet, 1990 : Principals and Practice of
Infectious Diseases. New York, Churchill Winston, 3rd edition, page 1294:
"The reported incubation period of rabies in the literature has varied from
as short as 4 days to as long as 19 years. Ninety-five percent of the cases
have incubation periods less than 1 year, although several well-documented
cases have occurred 1-5 years or more after exposure..... The incubation
period is usually between 20 and 90 days. It has been reported to be shorter
when the site of the bite is on the head (25-48 days) than when it is on an
extremity (48-78 days). This difference may be related to the severity of
the bite or to the quantity of virus inoculated."

rabies virus travels, very slowly, along nerve fibers. - Mod.JW]
