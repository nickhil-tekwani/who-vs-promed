["AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity -- the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic chickens.

"Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock. Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness." https://goo.gl/nzis8z

"Most AI virus strains are low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and typically cause little or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds' feces and secretions. It spreads primarily through direct contact between healthy and infected birds. It can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.

"To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. AI viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough cleaning and disinfection, the area must be clear of organic material." https://goo.gl/cZSuAZ

In 2016, Germany reported findings of LPAI associated with H5N2, H5N3 and H5N1 subtypes. These events are all resolved. The situation for each of these LPAI events is as follows:

1. LPAI H5N2: event started 18 Nov 2016; 3 outbreaks reported, and the event was resolved on 19 Feb 2017. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21648.

2. LPAI H5N1: the event started on 30 Nov 2016; one outbreak reported, and the event was resolved on 14 Feb 2017. http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=21824.

3. LPAI H5N3: event started 22 Dec 2017; 3 outbreaks reported, and the event was resolved on 30 May 2017. See event summary and updated map: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22550. - Mod.CRD
