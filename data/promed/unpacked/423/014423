Puerto Rico: 3 Equine Cases of West Nile Virus-infection Detected in Fajardo
---------------------------------------------------
Health Secretary Johnny Rullan announced on Fri 18 Jun 2004 the
detection of 3 new cases of West Nile virus infection on the island,
this time involving horses, and he urged the public to practice
safety measures to avoid becoming infected. [Previously on 9 Jun
2004, serological evidence of West Nile virus infection of 2
presumptive resident birds was announced by Health Secretary Rullan;
see "West Nile virus, birds - Puerto Rico (Ceiba) 200406141599", and
"West Nile virus update 2004 - Western Hemisphere (03)
20040617.1624". Evidence of West Nile virus infection of horses
represents a significant extension of host range, confirming that
West Nile virus is now circulating in Puerto Rico. - Mod.CP]

The 3 horses, which were otherwise healthy, were found in the Fajardo
area. The 1st appearance of the virus was detected a week ago in 2
birds captured in Ceiba. Rullan said there has yet to be a case of
infection in humans on the island. "We are at a very early stage of
virus detection, which is good, but we are going to have to learn to
live with it, just like we learned how to live with dengue," Rullan
said.

According to the health chief, mosquito bites are the only way to
spread the infection to other animals, including people. However, a
mosquito cannot get infected by biting a person or a horse already
carrying the virus. Rullan also said a person cannot be infected with
the virus from just eating a chicken that has been infected by
mosquito bite.

The Health chief said only 20 percent of people infected with the
virus actually show symptoms, which usually appear from 3 to 14 days
after infection. Infected people become immune to future exposures to
the virus. Even though the virus will disappear from a person's body
on its own, exposure to the virus automatically disqualifies the
individual as a potential blood donor, just for safety purposes.

[Horses are very susceptible to the virus. Although a horse infected
with West Nile virus can survive, there have been a number of equine
deaths following West Nile virus infection. The horses do become very
ill in most cases. 2 equine vaccines preventative for the viral
disease have been approved in the US. These vaccines may well be
available in Puerto Rico. - Mod.TG]
