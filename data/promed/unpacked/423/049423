[ProMED-mail had commmented: "Interesting that it was reported that the
first warning was given 13 August and that the patient was hospitalized on
21 August. Perhaps they are conducting mosquito and sentinel surveillance
and had advance notice? - Mod.CHC"
I spent last year working in Korea; the Health Canada travel advisory
website advises vaccination for Japanese encephalitis for travellers who
will be spending extended periods in rural areas of South Korea. South
Korea does have a good public health surveillance network, and South Cholla
and South Kyungsang Province, both at the extreme south of the country, are
regions of extensive rice production. I suspect that they did have good
advance notice.
