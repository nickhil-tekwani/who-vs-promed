Rift Valley Fever Death Toll Rises to 116 in Saudi Arabia
---------------------------------------------------------
RIYADH: The death toll in Saudi Arabia from Rift Valley fever virus
outbreak, which surfaced in the Arabian peninsula last September, has risen
to 116, the Health Ministry reported on Thursday. In a statement carried
by the SPA news agency, the Ministry announced that: "116 people had died
of Rift Valley fever up to Thu 11 Jan 2001, and 853 people in all have
contracted the disease, of whom 727 have left hospital after treatment."
Health Ministers from the 6-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meeting
in Kuwait on Wed 10 Jan 2001 praised Saudi efforts to control the fever and
urged the 5 other member states to take all precautions.
In neighboring Yemen Rift Valley fever has claimed the lives of 109 people,
