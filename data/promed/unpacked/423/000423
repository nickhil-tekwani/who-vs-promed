In 2017, over 140 000 reindeer will be vaccinated against anthrax, the Nenets Autonomous Area website quoted Alexander Antonov, the local chief veterinary inspector, as saying at an emergency anti-epizootic commission session. "Like last year, the vaccination campaign will cover the maximum number of reindeer owned privately by individual herders and by the Yamb-To family herding community whose reindeer graze in the northeast of the Nenets area," the report says.

In 2016, the anthrax outbreak in the neighboring Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Area prompted the Nenets authorities to urgently expand reindeer vaccinations to cover an extra 35 000 animals. These were mostly reindeer belonging to individual herders who were not registered in the Nenets area but who regularly bring their herds from neighboring Yamal, including animals from the Yamb-To family community.

Experts said the epidemic risk in the Nenets area is low, as the reindeer [now] receive an anti-anthrax dose every year.

I would not be surprised if we see more reports this 2017 summer anthrax-season elsewhere in Siberia. From the interest and caution catalyzed by the 2016 monster reindeer epizootic, casual singular sporadic deaths will no longer be ignored. It will be interesting to see how far the vaccination response goes to successfully prevent future outbreaks. Persuading owners and bureaucrats to vaccinate when there have been apparently no cases is always an uphill battle. And in the meantime when outbreaks occur they are in livestock that had not been vaccinated -- natures blunt way of reminding us to keep our fingers out. And there comes a time after some 7 - 10 years of vaccination and good induced herd immunity when enough spores have died to not be able to induce new outbreaks. - Mod.MHJ]
