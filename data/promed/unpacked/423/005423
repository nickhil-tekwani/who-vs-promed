Wisonsin: West Nile Virus Infection Among Turkey Farm Workers in 2002
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In 2002, Wisconsin public health officials were notified of 2 cases
of febrile illness in workers at a commercial turkey breeder farm
(farm A) in county A. The Wisconsin Division of Public Health (WDPH)
initiated an investigation that found a high prevalence of West Nile
virus (WNV) antibody among farm A workers and turkeys. An associated
high incidence of febrile illness among farm A workers also was
observed.
This report summarizes the results of this investigation, which
indicate possible non-mosquito transmission among birds and
subsequent infection of humans at farm A. Because the mode of
transmission in this outbreak is unknown, turkey handlers should take
appropriate precautions, including use of DEET-containing mosquito
repellents, protective clothing and gloves, respiratory protection,
and proper hand hygiene. Suspected occupationally acquired WNV
infections should be reported immediately to local and state health
departments.
During November 2002, WDPH and the Wisconsin State Laboratory of
Hygiene (WSLH) confirmed that 2 ill residents of county A had been
infected with WNV. Before these reports, only one human WNV infection
had been reported in this county. Both persons worked at farm A and
had febrile illness with rash during late September to early October
2002. These human illnesses occurred after a suspected fowl pox
outbreak among farm A turkeys in September. Workers were concerned
the pox outbreak might be associated with their illnesses.
Farm A is one of 6 turkey breeder farms in county A owned by a
company that also operates non-breeder farms and a turkey meat
processing plant in county A. The 5 other turkey breeder farms are
located within 10 miles of farm A, and multiple private residences
are within 1/4 mile. In February 2003, county and state public health
staff, in collaboration with the company, identified workers at the 6
turkey breeder farms, the non-breeder farms, and the plant, and
requested their consent to participate in a serosurvey. Serum samples
were collected from participating workers (N = 93) to identify
persons infected recently. A questionnaire was administered to
identify persons who had a febrile illness during August to October
2002. Serum samples also were collected from residents (N = 14) who
lived within 1/4 mile of farm A. All serum samples were tested for
WNV-specific IgM antibody at WSLH (ref. 1). IgM-positive specimens
were confirmed by plaque-reduction neutralization tests at CDC (ref.
2). Of 107 total participants, 10 (9 percent) were seropositive. Of
approximately 90 workers at the 6 breeder farms, 57 (63 percent)
participated; of these, 10 (18 percent) were infected recently with
WNV. None of the meat processing workers or other area residents was
infected. Of 11 persons who worked exclusively at farm A, 6 (55
percent) were WNV IgM-positive, compared with 2 (25 percent) of 8 who
worked at both farm A and other breeder farms and 2 (5 percent) of 38
who worked only at other breeder farms. Of the 10 IgM-positive
workers, 6 (60 percent) reported febrile headaches during August to
October 2002 (all occurring during the last week of September),
compared with 7 (7 percent) of 97 IgM-negative persons sampled (p =
0.0002 by Fisher exact test). All 6 IgM-positive persons who reported
febrile headache had worked at farm A. All 6 noted a skin rash, and
one had meningoencephalitis and was hospitalized; no deaths occurred.
Reported mosquito exposures and bites were similar for IgM-positive
(9 [90 percent] and 8 [80 percent] of 10, respectively) and
IgM-negative workers (67 [85 percent] and 54 [68 percent] of 79,
respectively). Only one (2 percent) of 57 breeder farm workers
reported using insect repellent while working.
Farm A includes 2 breeder bird barns and a juvenile flock barn. The
breeder barns separate uncaged females from male turkeys with a solid
plywood wall. The sides of the barns housing the female turkeys are
covered with 1 in. x 1 in. mesh wire fencing and plastic curtains
that can be adjusted to lower the temperature during warm months.
Sera from farm A turkeys and turkeys from the nearest breeder farm
were collected in late January 2003. The farm A flock sampled was the
group of birds housed in the juvenile flock barn from mid-June to
early December 2002, at which time this flock was moved to a breeder
barn on farm A to replace a flock slaughtered in November 2002. The
flock sampled on the nearby farm was a breeder flock also in place in
September. Both flocks had suspected fowl pox outbreaks during
September. Serum samples were submitted to the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories for
WNV-neutralizing antibody testing. Of 135 farm A female turkeys, 130
(96 percent) had WNV-neutralizing antibody (measured at 2 dilutions,
1:10 and 1:100, and considered to be positive if a given dilution
neutralized >90 percent of virus growth). No WNV-neutralizing
antibody was found in 135 female turkeys tested from the nearby farm
or 30 male turkeys tested from either farm.

MMWR Editorial Note
-------------------
The investigation described in this report found that workers at farm
A had a higher incidence of febrile illness and prevalence of WNV
antibodies than workers at other breeder and non-breeder farms,
workers at a turkey meat processing facility, or persons who lived on
or near the affected farm and who did not work in the turkey barns.
The mode of transmission to these workers is unknown. Although the
majority of human WNV infections are mosquito-borne, transmission by
less typical routes might have occurred, including percutaneous
(e.g., exposure of broken skin or mucosa to infected turkey feces or
serous exudates from dually-infected pox lesions), fecal-oral, or
respiratory (e.g., exposure to aerosolized infected turkey feces).
The WNV seroprevalence (96 percent) among female turkeys on farm A
was high. However, experimental evidence suggests that turkeys
develop insufficient levels of WNV viremia to contribute to a
bird-mosquito-bird amplification cycle (ref. 3). Although WNV was
detected in the feces of these turkeys, no oropharyngeal shedding or
transmission to cage mates was observed (ref. 3). Nonvector-borne WNV
transmission has been demonstrated experimentally among rodents and
among certain bird species other than turkeys (refs. 4,5). Once WNV
was introduced to female turkeys at farm A (presumably by
mosquitoes), widespread transmission within that flock might have
taken place by fecal-oral, respiratory, or another atypical (e.g.,
percutaneous exposure associated with pecking behavior or
vaccination) route. In addition, other unique conditions at farm A,
including possible co-infection with an avian pox virus, might have
resulted in higher WNV viremias or infectious materials with higher
WNV titers than laboratory studies have suggested.
Despite uncertainty over the mode(s) of transmission, epidemiologic
evidence suggests that this outbreak was related to occupational
exposure. Occupationally acquired WNV infections have been reported
previously among laboratory or field workers who experienced a known
percutaneous injury or aerosol exposure while working with high
concentrations of WNV in cell culture or infected animal tissues
(refs. 6, 7, 8, 9). In this investigation, no such exposure was
documented. Because the mode of transmission in this outbreak is
unknown, turkey handlers should 1) take personal protective measures,
including wearing protective clothing and using mosquito repellents
(e.g., those containing DEET on skin and clothing and those
containing permethrin on clothing), as recommended for outdoor
workers; 2) wear gloves; and 3) wash hands frequently. In addition,
respiratory protection has been recommended for reducing other
exposures to workers in turkey barns (ref. 10). Respiratory
protection should be selected and used in accordance with the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) respiratory
protection standard (Title 29 CFR 1910.134).
Workers should receive training that reinforces awareness of
potential occupational hazards and risks and stresses the importance
of timely reporting of all injuries and illnesses of suspected
occupational origin.
Health-care workers should inquire about a patient's outdoor exposure
and occupation when a human WNV infection is suspected or identified
and consider WNV as a possible etiology among turkey farm workers
with febrile headache or rash, meningitis, encephalitis, or other
severe neurologic illness, especially when WNV illnesses exist among
co-workers or birds. Suspected occupationally acquired WNV infections
should be reported immediately to local and state health departments.
The investigation of turkey breeder farm workers in county A is
ongoing. In addition, further studies are needed to determine the
factors involved in this outbreak, to better define the occupational
risk for WNV infections, and to assess appropriate personal
protective measures. On the basis of recommendations from public
health staff, the company has made mosquito repellent containing 30
percent DEET available at farm A and other turkey breeder farms.
Recommendations that were outlined previously in place at the company
farms include protective clothing, frequent hand washing, and an
OSHA-required respiratory protection program. Gloves and safety
glasses also are available to workers.
