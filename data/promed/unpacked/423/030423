As of 1 PM (ET), Sat 23 Sep 2006, 171 persons infected with the
outbreak strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7 have been reported to CDC from
25 states. Among the ill persons, 92 (54 percent) were hospitalized,
27 (16 percent) developed a type of kidney failure called
hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and an adult in Wisconsin died. 123
(72 percent) were female and 14 (8 percent) were children under 5
years old. The proportion of persons who developed HUS was 31 percent
in children (<18 years old), 7 percent in persons 18 to 59 years old,
and 16 percent in persons 60 years old or older. Among ill persons
who provided the date when their illnesses began, 88 percent became
ill between 19 Aug and 5 Sep 2006. The peak time when illnesses began
was 30 Aug to 1 Sep 2006; 35 percent of persons with the outbreak
strain became ill on one of those 3 days.
Two deaths among suspect cases have been reported. Suspect cases are
not known to have been infected with the outbreak strain so are not
included in the confirmed case count. Idaho is investigating a
suspect case in a 2-year-old child with HUS who died on 20 Sep 2006
and reportedly had recently consumed fresh spinach. _E. coli_ O157
has not been detected in the child. Maryland is investigating a
suspect case in an elderly woman who died on 13 Sep 2006 and had
recently consumed fresh spinach. _E. coli_ O157 was cultured from her
stool, but "DNA fingerprinting" to determine whether it is the
outbreak strain has not been possible.
CDC Advice for Consumers
The following is advice for consumers about this outbreak:
- Currently, we are advising consumers to not eat any fresh spinach
or salad blends containing spinach grown in the 3 counties in
California implicated in the current _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak:
Monterey County, San Benito County, and Santa Clara County. Fresh
spinach grown outside these counties can be safely eaten. Frozen and
canned spinach can be safely eaten.
- _E. coli_ O157:H7 in spinach can be killed by cooking at 160 F for
15 seconds. (Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.) If spinach is
cooked in a frying pan, and all parts do not reach 160 F, all
bacteria may not be killed. If consumers choose to cook the spinach,
they should not allow the raw spinach to contaminate other foods and
food contact surfaces, and they should wash hands, utensils, and
surfaces with hot, soapy water before and after handling the spinach.
- Persons who develop diarrhea after consuming fresh spinach or salad
blends containing fresh spinach are urged to visit their health care
provider and ask that their stool specimen be tested for _E. coli_
O157.
- Persons who ate fresh spinach or salad blends and feel well do not
need to see a health care provider.
