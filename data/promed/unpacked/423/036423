Two hantavirus infections, neither fatal, in Hong Kong since the beginning
of the year have led health officials and municipal services to step up an
anti-pest awareness campaign. The cases were a 44-year-old man in March
whose residence showed signs of rodent infestation, and a 46-year-old woman
in April whose residence and place of work appeared free from rats.
[Number of cases] in recent years have been:
1994 1
1995 1
1996 4
1997 5

[Assuming these cases have been laboratory-confirmed by serologic means,
there still remains the question as to the specific etiologic agent. My
suspicion would be Seoul virus, a close relative of Hantaan virus, which is
the etiologic agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, a.k.a. Korean
hemorrhagic fever or epidemic hemorrhagic fever, usually detected in field
mice, particularly _Apodemus_ sp. Seoul virus, originally isolated from a
rat (_Rattus rattus_), has been isolated from rats in sea ports essentially
world-wide. - Mod.CHC]
