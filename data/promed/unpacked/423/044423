I am the assistant veterinarian at Edinburgh Zoo and dealt with our
outbreak. We had 15 birds ill, the disease was quickly diagnosed and all
birds were successfully treated -- we did NOT have any deaths due to avian
malaria. Anna Meredith was misquoted.
It is sadly true that Marwell lost all their penguins, however, not all of
them have been confirmed as deaths due to avian malaria (_Plasmodium_).
Also, the disease in penguins tends to present as dyspnea (difficulty
breathing) and regurgitation, as in our penguins at Edinburgh. The
_Plasmodium_ cause lung and liver damage primarily in penguins. Again, the
press here seem to have their facts confused. Of course when Edinburgh Zoo
issued a press statement to correct this story, the press regarded our
'saved' penguins as a non-story...

I saw the information on penguin malaria in the UK. In the US, malaria
continues to be a major problem for captive penguin populations. There is a
long history of research on malaria in penguins at the Baltimore Zoo ---
diagnosis, treatment, transmission, animal models. I did my doctoral thesis
on this subject and would be happy to share further information.
