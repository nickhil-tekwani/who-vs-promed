Additional laboratory tests confirmed that the salmonella strain
found in an unregulated Mexican-style cheese sold at a local Hispanic
grocery store exhibits the same patterns as the bacteria found in a
recent outbreak of the disease in Kane County.
"This would likely indicate the same source," Claire Dobbins, the
Kane County Health Department's director of communicable disease
control, told the county board's public health committee Tue 27 Mar 2007.
Two additional cases of the food-borne illness have been reported
since 22 Mar 2007, when the health department held a news conference
to warn people not to eat the cheese, usually labeled as "queso
fresco" and "queso cotija". The Illinois Department of Public Health
also issued a warning.
The new cases bring to 34 the number of people infected with the
Newport serotype of salmonella in Kane County since January 2006.
Typically, there are only about 8 such cases reported here in a
14-month period, officials said.
Last week, preliminary lab results indicated salmonella was present
in a sample of cheese purchased at El Paso Carniceria, 508 Grove St.,
Aurora, Illinois. Officials believe the cheese is sold at stores
across the county. Health department officials still do not know
where the cheese originated.
