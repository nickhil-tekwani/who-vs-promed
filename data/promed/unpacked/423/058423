Sheep/ 5.74 percent/ 0.92 percent/ 16.07 percent/ 0.92 percent

* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Vectors

Epidemiological comments: Due to national vaccination campaigns in 2008-2010, intensive surveillance in 2008-2011 revealed the last infections of BTV-8 in spring 2008. 2 years have passed without virus circulation.

According to the aforementioned information and to the Article 8.3.3. of the Chapter 8.3. of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2011), the Delegate of The Netherlands declares that the bluetongue event is resolved and that, therefore, her country regains its notifiable bluetongue free status as from 1 March 2012.

Future Reporting: The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The report includes an interactive map showing the locations of all 6471 outbreaks in cattle and sheep. Bluetongue monitoring data in the Netherlands during 2009, 2010 and 2011 were summarised by the Dutch delegation at the Scofcah meeting, January 2012; see at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1112012012_bt_netherlands_en.pdf, with the following conclusions:

1. No BTV-circulation in the Netherlands in 2009, 2010 and 2011.
2. Can be extrapolated to any BTV-serotype, since fully susceptible cattle were tested and applied diagnostic tests detect all serotypes.

At the same meeting, Germany and Luxembourg delivered their respective final reports with similar conclusions.

BTV-8 was identified for the 1st time in the Netherlands (and Belgium, Germany) in August 2006; a total of 454 outbreaks were reported by the Dutch to the OIE until the end of the year; see, with interactive map,
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=2323.

Though the disease was reported as resolved on 31 Dec 2006, it was identified again in 2007, continuing throughout 2008. In fact, the BTV-8 epizootic took place for 3 consecutive years 2006-2008. The current follow-up report is final, addressing the 2007-2008 epizootic.

The origin of the BTV-8 virus and its route of introduction still await their elucidation; this is critical to prevent its reintroduction and -- moreover -- new introductions of vector-borne diseases of animal and man. The 2011 similarly enigmatic introduction of Schmallenberg virus to the very same region illustrates the acute need for the epidemiological clarification. - Mod.AS
