Ebola situation report - 29 Apr 2015
--------------------------------
Summary
----
A total of 33 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) was reported in the week to 26 Apr 2015. Two areas, Forecariah in Guinea and Kambia in Sierra Leone, accounted for 25 (76 percent) of all confirmed cases reported. Improved community engagement in these areas is required to ensure that all remaining chains of transmission can be tracked and ultimately brought to an end.

Guinea reported 22 confirmed cases in the week to 26 Apr 2015, compared with 19 cases the previous week. Sierra Leone reported 11 confirmed cases, compared with 12 cases the previous week. Liberia reported no confirmed cases for the 5th consecutive week. Of 55 districts in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone that have reported at least one confirmed case of EVD since the start of the outbreak, 39 have not reported a case for over 6 weeks.

A total of 5 Guinean prefectures reported at least one confirmed case in the week to 26 Apr 2015. No cases were reported from the capital, Conakry. The vast majority of cases (17 of 22: 77 percent) were reported from the western prefecture of Forecariah, which borders the Sierra Leonean district of Kambia.

Three districts in Sierra Leone reported new confirmed cases in the week to 26 Apr 2015, compared with 4 districts the previous week. In addition to 8 confirmed cases reported from Kambia, one case was reported from Western Area Urban, which includes the capital Freetown, and 2 new cases were reported from Western Area Rural.

In Sierra Leone, a total of 4 confirmed cases were identified in the community after post-mortem testing (all from Kambia) in the week to 26 Apr 2015, compared with 3 the previous week. Additionally, half (50 percent) of new cases reported in the week to 19 Apr 2015 (the most recent period for which data are available) arose among known contacts of previous cases. Laboratory indicators reflect a heightened degree of vigilance, with 1406 new samples tested in the week to 26 Apr 2015. Less than one percent of samples tested positive for EVD.

Response indicators for Guinea present a similarly mixed picture. A total of 8 confirmed EVD cases in the week to 26 Apr 2015 were identified after post-mortem testing of deaths identified in the community, compared with 6 the previous week. A total of 66 unsafe burials were reported in the week to 26 Apr 2015. The percentage of confirmed cases that arose among registered contacts decreased to 27 percent (6 of 22) in the week to 26 Apr 2015, from 53 percent the previous week. However, laboratory indicators continue to improve with a 7th consecutive weekly rise in the number of laboratory samples tested to 585.

In both Guinea and Sierra Leone, the fact that cases continue to be identified after post-mortem testing together with the fact that around half of all cases arise in people not identified as contacts of previous cases suggest that surveillance and community engagement still require improvement in some areas. A case-finding and community-awareness campaign took place in the Guinean prefecture of Coyah from 24 to 27 Apr 2015, with over 57 000 households visited over 4 days. 44 alerts were reported over the 4-day operation: an increase of 91 percent compared with the previous week. None of the alerts resulted in confirmed cases, although 10 laboratory samples are still pending. Similar initiatives are planned for the prefectures of Boffa, Conakry, Dubreka, and Kindia.

The last confirmed case in Liberia died on 27 Mar 2015 and was buried on 28 Mar 2015. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country. In the 4 days to 23 Apr 2015, 194 new laboratory samples were tested for EVD with no confirmed cases. On 9 May 2015, 42 days will have elapsed since the burial of the last confirmed case.

For the 2nd consecutive week, no new health worker infections were reported in the week to 26 Apr 2015.

Countries with widespread and intense transmission
------------------------------------------------------------
There have been a total of 26 277 reported confirmed, probable, and suspected cases of EVD in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone (figure 1, table 1), with 10 884 reported deaths (outcomes for many cases are unknown). A total of 22 new confirmed cases were reported in Guinea, 0 in Liberia, and 11 in Sierra Leone in the 7 days to 26 Apr 2015.

The total number of confirmed and probable cases is similar in males and females (table 2). Compared with children (people aged 14 years and under), people aged 15 to 44 are approximately 3 times more likely to be affected. People aged 45 and over are 3-5 times more likely to be affected than children.

A total of 865 confirmed health worker infections have been reported in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone; there have been 504 reported deaths (Table 5).

According to WHO, the decline in Ebola's spread has " plateaued," partly due to "persistently high transmission" in Guinea and Sierra Leone. The concern is that the rainy season will make it more difficult for responders to reach remote areas. It is good news that transmission has stabilized, albeit not yet at 0. But it is disturbing that disease is occurring where virus is circulating in unrecognized chains of transmission. This makes getting to 0 cases even more challenging. - Mod.LK]

Executive summary
----------------------
Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic - West Africa - 2014 - 2015

Opening date: 22 Mar 2014 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015
---------------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has been ongoing in West Africa since December 2013, mainly affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. On 8 Aug 2014, WHO declared the Ebola epidemic in West Africa a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Update of the week. As of 21 Apr 2015, WHO reported 26 074 cases of Ebola virus disease related to the outbreak in West Africa, including 10 820 deaths. 33 new confirmed cases of EVD were reported in the week from 13 to 19 Apr 2015 from Guinea (21 cases) and Sierra Leone (12 cases). Liberia reported no new confirmed cases. According to WHO, community engagement appears to be steadily improving in Guinea and Sierra Leone. A case-finding and community awareness-raising campaign took place in the Guinean prefecture of Forecariah from 12 to 15 Apr 2015, identifying 12 new confirmed cases, 7 of which were from post-mortem testing. A similar campaign is planned for the prefectures of Coyah, Dubreka, Conakry, Kindia and Boffa.

Detailed reports
Ebola Virus Disease Epidemic - West Africa - 2014 - 2015
Opening date: 22 Mar 2014 Latest update: 23 Apr 2015
Epidemiological summary
Distribution of cases as of 21 Apr 2015:

Countries with intense transmission
-----------------------------------------
Guinea: 3568 cases, of which 3144 are confirmed, and 2362 deaths (as of 21 Apr 2015). - Liberia: 10 212 cases, of which 3151 are confirmed, and 4573 deaths (as of 19 Apr 2015). - Sierra Leone: 12 294 cases, of which 8581 are confirmed, and 3885 deaths (as of 21 Apr 2015).

Countries with an initial case or cases, or with localised transmission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United States and United Kingdom have been declared free of EVD after having cases related to the current epidemic in West Africa.

Situation in specific West African countries
----------------------------------
In Guinea, according to WHO, 4 prefectures reported at least one confirmed case in the week to 19 Apr 2015, compared with 5 in the previous week. Transmission remains confined to the west of the country and is primarily focused on the prefecture of Forecariah, bordering Sierra Leone, which reported 86 percent of all confirmed cases. Response indicators for Guinea continue to present a mixed picture. In the week up to 19 Apr 2015, 6 confirmed deaths from EVD were identified post-mortem in the community. In addition, 46 percent of confirmed cases arose among registered contacts, a figure below 50 percent for the 3rd consecutive week.

In Sierra Leone, WHO reported cases from 4 districts: Kambia, Port Loko, Koinadugu and Western Area Urban, which includes the capital, Freetown.

Response indicators from Sierra Leone also present a mixed picture. The number of EVD-positive deaths that were identified in the community after post-mortem testing was 3 in the week up to 19 Apr 2015, but the percentage of new cases arising from known contacts dropped to 44 percent from 67 percent in the previous week.

In Liberia, the last confirmed case died on 27 Mar 2015. Investigations are ongoing to establish the origin of infection. Heightened vigilance is being maintained throughout the country. In the 6 days up to 19 Apr 2015, 212 laboratory samples were tested for EVD, with no confirmed cases. If no new cases occur, the country will be declared Ebola free on 9 May 2015.

Situation among healthcare workers
-------------------------------
In the week to 19 Apr 2015, WHO reported no new infection among healthcare workers (HCWs). The cumulative total of HCWs infected with EVD remains 864: 187 in Guinea, 374 in Liberia and 303 in Sierra Leone. 504 HCWs have died of the disease.

Outside of the 3 most affected countries, 2 Ebola-infected HCWs were reported in Mali, 11 in Nigeria, one in Spain (infected while caring for an evacuated EVD patient), 2 in the UK (both infected in Sierra Leone), and 6 in the USA (2 infected in Sierra Leone, 2 in Liberia and 2 infected while caring for a confirmed case in Texas).

Medical evacuations and repatriations from EVD-affected countries
-------------------------------
Since the beginning of the epidemic and as of 9 Apr 2015, 65 individuals have been evacuated or repatriated worldwide from the EVD-affected countries. Of these, 38 individuals have been evacuated or repatriated to Europe. 13 were medical evacuations of confirmed EVD-infected patients to: Germany (3), Spain (2), France (2), UK (2), Norway (1), Italy (1), Netherlands (1) and Switzerland (1). 25 asymptomatic persons have been repatriated to Europe as a result of exposure to Ebola in West Africa: UK (13), Denmark (4), Sweden (3), Netherlands (2), Germany (1), Spain (1) and Switzerland (1).

27 persons have been evacuated to the United States. No new medical evacuations have taken place since 18 Mar 2015.

ECDC assessment
---------------------
This is the largest ever documented epidemic of EVD, both in terms of numbers and geographical spread. The epidemic of EVD increases the likelihood that EU residents and travellers to the EVD-affected countries will be exposed to infected or ill persons. The risk of infection for residents and visitors in the affected countries through exposure in the community is considered low if they adhere to the recommended precautions. Residents and visitors to the affected areas run a risk of exposure to EVD in healthcare facilities.

The risk of importing EVD into the EU and the risk of transmission within the EU following an importation remain low or very low as a result of the range of risk reduction measures that have been put in place by the Member States and by the affected countries in West Africa. However, continued vigilance is essential. If a symptomatic case of EVD presents in an EU Member State, secondary transmission to caregivers in the family and in healthcare facilities cannot be excluded.

According to WHO, the decline in confirmed cases of EVD has slowed down as the number of cases has stayed stable during the past 3 weeks in Guinea and Sierra Leone. In both countries, less than half of all new confirmed cases are identified among known Ebola contacts, and people continue to be diagnosed with Ebola post mortem. These patterns indicate that the disease is circulating in unrecognised chains of transmission. In order to achieve 0 cases, there is a need for stronger community engagement, improved contact tracing, and earlier case identification.

Actions
--------
As of 24 Apr 2015, ECDC has deployed 62 experts coming from within and outside the EU in response to the Ebola outbreak. This includes an ECDC mobilised contingent of experts to Guinea. Furthermore, additional experts are already confirmed for deployment to Guinea over the next months.

ECDC is looking for additional French-speaking experts with field epidemiology experience from EU Member States to join the ECDC-coordinated contingent in response to the Ebola outbreak in Guinea. For further information, please contact Alice Friaux at: <alice.friaux@ecdc.europa.eu> with copy to <support@ecdc.europa.eu>.

An epidemiological update is published weekly on the EVD ECDC page. The latest (10th) update of the rapid risk assessment was published on 15 Apr 2015.

On 22 Jan 2014, ECDC published Infection prevention and control measures for Ebola virus disease. Management of healthcare workers returning from Ebola-affected areas.
On 4 Dec 2014, EFSA-ECDC published a Scientific Report assessing Risk related to household pets in contact with Ebola cases in humans.
