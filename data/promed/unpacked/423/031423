2 of China's provinces today [25 Apr 2013] reported 3 more H7N9 influenza infections, while another province awaits test results for what may be its 1st case, according to official and media reports today.

The new case-patients include a 56-year-old man from Henan province who is hospitalized in critical condition and 2 women, ages 50 and 60, from Zhejiang province who are hospitalized in serious condition, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said in an update today [25 Apr 2013]. The new cases raised the number of lab-confirmed H7N9 infections to 112, which includes 22 [elsewhere given as 23] deaths.

Both of the provinces are in eastern China, where the outbreak is centered. Yesterday [24 Apr 2013], China's agriculture ministry reported new H7N9 findings from markets in Henan and Zhejiang provinces. The virus was found in 2 environmental samples from 2 different markets in Henan province, as well as in bird samples from a market in Zhejiang province, according to a report from the World Organisation for Animal health (OIE).

Meanwhile, health officials in Jiangxi province are investigating a suspected H7N9 infection in a 69-year-old man, according to the CHP report. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) is conducting confirmation tests on the man's samples. If confirmed, the case would the 1st for Jiangxi province, which is located about 450 miles southwest of Shanghai. Jiangxi would be the southernmost province in which H7N9 was detected. In the middle of April 2013, Chinese officials reported a mild H7N9 infection in a Shanghai child who got sick while traveling in Hunan province, but it wasn't clear whether the youngster was exposed to the virus in Hunan or Shanghai. The World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region Office (WPRO) said in an update today [25 Apr 2013] that no new illness clusters have been reported, and there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission. There have been no reports of H7N9 in animals outside of China, the WHO WPRO said.

Prevention
----------
In other developments, China's finance ministry announced yesterday [24 Apr 2013] that it will put USD 48.6 million toward H7N9 prevention efforts, Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported. Projects include monitoring H7N9 cases, conducting respiratory illness surveillance, and expanding health insurance programs to cover more medication and services for H7N9 patients.

New case report of 2 men
------------------------
Also, a medical team from China has published a new case report of 2 men who were hospitalized with H7N9 infections in Shanghai in late March and early April 2013. The report appears in the latest issue of BioScience Trends, a peer-reviewed journal published by a medical research organization in Japan. The 74-year-old man described in the report had been exposed to poultry, but the 65-year-old had not. Both had underlying medical conditions. The older man had coronary and liver disease, and the younger of the 2 had hypertension.

Both patients had a similar clinical course, with respiratory symptoms, fever, rapid progression of lower respiratory disease, and significant hypoxemia. They were treated with oseltamivir (Tamiflu), antibiotics, and immunoglobulin. The authors said they saw no reason to administer hormone (corticosteroid) treatment. The conditions of both men have improved, and their illnesses appear to have stabilized.

Health authorities in east China's Jiangxi province late on Thursday [25 Apr 2013] confirmed the province's 1st human case of H7N9 avian influenza. A 69-year-old man, a local retiree in the provincial capital of Nanchang, showed symptoms of high fever, tight chest and diarrhea, and was admitted to the No. 3 Hospital in Nanchang, according to a statement issued by the provincial health department. He is in critical condition, said the statement. He had not left the city recently, nor had he any contact with dead birds, but lives near a live poultry market, the statement said. The city's disease control authority has quarantined 14 people who have had close contact with the patient. None of them have exhibited any abnormal symptoms.

Three more new cases of H7N9 bird flu were reported on Thursday [25 Apr 2013], 2 in Zhejiang province and one in Henan province.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its Wednesday [24 Apr 2013] update that the total number of H7N9 cases reported in the mainland stood at 108, including 23 cases that have ended in death. Most of the cases were reported in east China's Shanghai municipality and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui.

Health authorities in east China's Fujian province on Friday [26 Apr 2013] confirmed the province's 1st human case of H7N9 avian influenza. A 65-year-old man, a local resident from Gaopo township, Yongding County, Longyan City, showed symptoms of repeated coughing, low fever and a tight chest on 18 Apr 2013. He was admitted to the No. 2 Hospital in Longyan on Tuesday [23 Apr 2013], according to a statement issued by the provincial health department.

The 65-year-old man was tested positive for the H7N9 virus at 11 a.m. on Friday [26 Apr 2013] by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. An examination of the patient at a clinical laboratory in Fujian province also confirmed the patient's infection with the H7N9 bird flu virus, the statement said. 37 people who have been in close contact with the man have not shown any abnormal symptoms so far.

Other provinces
---------------
4 new cases of H7N9 bird flu were reported on Thursday [25 Apr 2013], 2 in Zhejiang province, one in Henan province and one in Jiangxi province. The National Health and Family Planning Commission said in its Wednesday [24 Apr 2013] update that the total number of H7N9 cases reported in the mainland stood at 108 [now 112], including 23 cases that have ended in death.

Letter: Virus-host interactions and the unusual age and sex distribution of human cases of influenza A(H7N9) in China, April 2013.
From: Skowronski DM, Janjua NZ, Kwindt TL, De Serres G
------------------------------------------------------
Over the past 2 weeks, Eurosurveillance has published several timely papers related to the emergence of a new influenza A(H7N9) virus affecting humans in China [1-3]. Genetic studies by Kageyama et al. [1] and Jongens et al. [2] assessed evidence in the genome for virus origin, adaptation and virulence, and a paper by Corman et al. [3] described real-time reverse-transcription PCR assays for specific virus diagnosis. While these are important aspects of novel virus characterisation and detection, the accrual of over 100 human cases now also affords opportunity to consider evolving epidemiologic patterns as part of population risk assessment.

Perhaps the most intriguing impression to date from available surveillance findings has been the unexpected age/sex distribution of reported influenza A(H7N9) cases. The age range spans from 2 to 91 years, but 2/3rds of influenza A(H7N9) cases have been 50 years of age or older and 2/3rds have been male [4,5]. Illness severity, with a substantial case fatality rate of 20 percent, shows a similar age/sex profile [4,5]. Unlike the pattern observed for influenza A(H5N1), children, both boys and girls and notably the school-aged, are under-represented among influenza A(H7N9) detections. Among the 1st 100 adult influenza A(H7N9) cases, men and women were equally represented in the youngest age category, 20-34 years, but men were 2-3-fold more frequent than women in older age groups. Furthermore, compared with women 20-34 years of age, women 50-64 and 65-79 years were each twice as frequent among influenza A(H7N9) detections. Conversely, men 50-64 and 65-79 years are each 4-5-fold more frequent among influenza A(H7N9) detections than men 20-34 years of age. While being careful not to over-interpret early surveillance data, what hypotheses might be invoked to explain that pattern?

Disease occurrence is the result of the classic interaction triad of agent-host-environment. Environmental factors such as differences in poultry exposure due to socio-cultural behaviours and host factors such as healthcare-seeking behaviour or underlying comorbid conditions have been postulated to explain these early influenza A(H7N9) surveillance signals [6,7]. However, hypotheses should also include the additional perspective of agent (i.e. virus)-host interactions. Immunological profiles by age likely reflect accumulated lifetime opportunities for influenza virus exposure, leaving intricate imprints that may positively or negatively modulate subsequent risk. We have illustrated this immunological complexity at the population level for influenza, showing variation in age-specific cross-reactive antibody levels to previously emerging influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus [8] and more recently to the emerging (swine-origin) influenza A(H3N2)v, probably reflecting complex cohort effects based on differential prime/boost exposures to influenza variants by age [9].

That pre-existing immunity can differentially modulate the infection process for novel pathogens may be relevant in understanding the differing age distributions of the emerging influenza A(H5N1) versus A(H7N9) viruses [6,7]. Anti-neuraminidase (N1) antibodies induced by cumulative influenza A(H1N1) lifetime exposures may have a role in mitigating risk and severity of influenza A(H5N1) infection [10-13] in older individuals, accounting for its more youthful profile to date [4-7]. In contrast, for influenza A(H7N9), we may anticipate that anti-N9 antibodies would be less prevalent overall in the population. Other population immunological effects of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, which affected predominantly young people, such as cross-reactive T-cell responses to generally conserved internal virus proteins [14] or memory B cell responses to shared epitopes within group 1 (i.e. H1, H5) versus group 2 (i.e. H3, H7) subtypes [15] may also need to be considered as factors that influence influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) age profiles.

At this stage, we should also stay open to the possibility that pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies may actually facilitate the viral infection process, a phenomenon best recognised for dengue through the mechanism of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) [16,17]. ADE is thought to occur when low-levels of weakly heterotypic, cross-reactive but not cross-protective, antibodies generated by past exposure to virus antigen, e.g. through prior infection or immunisation, form bridging complexes to facilitate uptake and replication of related but non-identical variants [16-18]. The possibility of ADE in influenza has long been and remains the subject of intense interest among experts [19,20], for which there may recently be indirect evidence.

Early during the 2009 influenza pandemic, we described a potentially important interaction between seasonal and novel emerging influenza virus, notably an approximate doubling of the likelihood of medically-attended pandemic influenza A(H1N1) illness among people previously administered seasonal influenza vaccine that contained virus antigenically related but distant from the emerging influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain [18]. In a follow-up experiment, vaccinated ferrets showed higher lung virus titres and greater illness severity after influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 challenge than influenza-naive animals [21]. In swine, disease exacerbation has also been observed following heterologous challenge [22-24]. ADE was one of the proposed (but unproven) hypotheses to explain the unexpected findings from Canada during the 2009 pandemic [18]. The possible relevance of weakly cross-reactive antibodies in facilitating infection due to other emerging influenza viruses with pandemic potential may, therefore, warrant further consideration.

In that regard, older Chinese men may not only have a greater likelihood of current poultry/bird exposure, to explain their disproportionate representation among influenza A(H7N9) cases, but also a greater total sum of lifetime avian influenza exposures, potentially contributing to cross-reactive H7 antibody. Few serosurveys to assess H7 antibodies in the population of China are available in the English language, and none has yet been sufficiently powered to compare this by age or sex [25-28].

In a serosurvey conducted 20 years ago in central China (Nanchang), 25 percent of 100 samples collected from women who raised pigs were found by ELISA to have antibodies to purified H7 antigen [25]. In a more recent serosurvey conducted in 2006-08 in northern China, 5-10 percent of ca. 1000 farmer families and poultry workers aged 5-87 years had detectable but low-level antibodies (titre of at least 1:20 but not exceeding 1:40) to influenza (H7N1) in a modified haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using horse erythrocytes [26]. In 2011, none of over 1500 duck-related workers in Beijing aged 14-71 years had influenza (H7N2) or (H5N1) titres exceeding 1:40 by modified HI, although seropositivity to influenza (H9N2) was more prevalent, particularly among adults older than 50 years of age in whom the rate of seropositivity was 4-fold higher than among younger participants [28].

Although the detection of antibodies to H7 subtype viruses has proved challenging even among culture-confirmed cases [29-35], serosurveys to compare cross-reactive antibodies and neutralising effects by multiple assays and by age group could be important, not only to inform possible protection, but also to explore patterns of enhanced risk in influenza A(H7N9) affected areas and more broadly elsewhere to inform risk assessment. Certain immunological effects, including ADE as it pertains to influenza, may yet be speculative. At this early stage of trying to understand the unexpected epidemiological patterns of an emerging pathogen, however, it is prudent for the global scientific and public health community to consider all possibilities within the full virus-host-environment paradigm.
