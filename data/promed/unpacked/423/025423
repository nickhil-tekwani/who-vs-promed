[This bovine brucellosis event in Belgian farms started almost a year ago (February 2012), leading, so far, to 6 outbreaks and the slaughter of more than 800 cattle. For the locations of the 6 foci recorded so far (2 of them in Temploux), see map at the bottom of OIE's archived report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012933_20130128_173053.pdf.

There also has been one cattle outbreak caused by _B. suis_ serovar 2 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20120520.1139015). While _B. suis_ seems to be endemic, circulating within the local wild boar population, the _B. abortus_ outbreaks may have been introduced by imported animals. Results of the investigations are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
