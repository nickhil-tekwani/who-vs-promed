Possible airport malaria in Paris
---------------------------------
Two Parisians are suffering from malaria, although they did not leave
France. The 2 young people have been hospitalized at CHU [University
Hospital Center] Nice since 23 Aug [2008]. "Their health is improving,"
said the Directorate General of Health (DGS). The 1st clinical signs
(fever, headache, vomiting, and decreased blood platelets) appeared on 18
Aug 2008, 5 days after their arrival in the south of France. The DGS said
that the couple visited friends 7 kilometres (4.4 mi) from the airport of
Roissy Charles de Gaulle from 5 to 7 Aug [2008]. If a search was launched
around their holiday location in Saint-Raphael in the Var region [in south
east France] in order to exclude the hypothesis of the presence of a
mosquito vector of malaria, it would appear that the diagnosis of
"indigenous malaria" called "of airport" is the most likely.

Points about these very rare cases:
How can a mosquito be a vector for infection in a healthy country?
Malaria is transmitted to humans by the bite of a female mosquito of the
genus _Anopheles_, herself infected after having bitten a person suffering
from malaria: females, while taking the blood meal necessary for their
egg-laying, inject the parasite in the host. The males do not bite.
Sometimes an infected _Anopheles_ mosquito is transported in the hold
baggage of an aircraft from a country where malaria is endemic to one where
it is not, having survived the trip. A case of infection declared after the
bite of this mosquito is called "airport malaria".
Airport staff exposed during a flight, a stopover, or while opening
containers and baggage, as well as residents of areas in the vicinity of
airports are most likely to be infected.

Is this common?
According to health authorities, airport malaria is rare, since the last
reported cases date back to 1999. Between 1977 and 1999, 28 cases were
observed in metropolitan France, that is, a maximum of one case per year.

How to fight against these cases?
The procedures for disinsectization were proposed by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and, in general, they are well respected by the
airlines: disinsect the aircraft by spraying an aerosol just before
boarding passengers or, in particular, before take off. Many countries
stressed the need for a new disinsection upon arrival, especially in
flights arriving from countries at risk and if there are doubts about how
the procedures were carried out in the originating country.
The DGS said that notification of all cases of malaria, indigenous or
imported, in the French Overseas Departments and Territories is mandatory.

[ProMED-mail thanks Susan Baekeland for sending a similar report.

As stated in the report, the term "airport malaria" is used when people are
infected from malaria-infected mosquitoes transported from endemic areas to
non-endemic areas. Airport malaria does not mean that there is a
transmission in the country where the case appears. Airport malaria and
other vector borne infections can, to a certain extent, be prevented by
spraying the aircraft (including the passenger cabin) with insecticides
just before departure. Whether this is done or not is determined by public
health authorities in the country where the plane lands. - Mod.EP]
