The 3 American tourists who were found dead earlier this month [May 2022] at an all-inclusive Sandals resort in the Bahamas passed away from carbon monoxide poisoning, a new report says.

A pathologist is expected to release autopsy and toxicology findings Monday [23 May 2022] following the [6 May 2022] deaths of [the 3 tourists -- a 68 and 65-year-old couple from Tennessee, and a 64-year-old man from Florida --] according to the Nassau Guardian.

The newspaper reported Monday [23 May 2022] that carbon monoxide poisoning was determined to be the cause of death.

The report could not be independently verified. Sandals did not immediately respond to a request Monday [23 May 2022] from Fox News Digital for comment. Each of the victims was staying at a villa at Sandals Emerald Bay on Great Exuma island.

Their families last week [week of 16 May 2022] reportedly asked investigators to allow a pathologist from abroad to perform a 2nd autopsy.

"The toxicology reports are still outstanding. There were requests by family members of the deceased to bring in a pathologist from abroad to do another autopsy," Bahamas Minister of Health and Wellness Michael Darville told reporters, according to Eyewitness News Bahamas.

The website reported the government will facilitate the request, as Darville wants to "get to the bottom" of the investigation.

[The 65-year-old wife of the victim from Florida], the lone survivor of the Sandals Bahamas incident, has been discharged from HCA Florida Kendall Hospital in Miami, a spokesperson there tells Fox News Digital.

Carbon monoxide poisoning was found to be the cause of death of 3 American tourists who were found at Sandals Emerald Bay Resort in Exuma earlier this month [May 2022], The Tribune was told.

Reports detailing the cause of deaths of [a couple] along with another individual are expected to be released in the coming days.

This comes after Royal Bahamas Police Force Commissioner Paul Rolle told The Tribune yesterday [22 May 2022] that authorities received results from samples sent to a lab in Philadelphia. The commissioner directed those results be sent to the local pathologist

The Royal Bahamas Police Force has received the results of samples sent abroad from 3 American tourists who were found dead at Sandals in Exuma, confirmed Commissioner of Police Paul Rolle yesterday [22 May 2022].

The samples, extracted from each of the 3 victims, were sent to a lab in Philadelphia for analysis earlier this month [May 2022].

Police Commissioner Rolle said he directed those results to be forwarded to the local pathologist. He said when a cause of death is released to the police, he will first release the results to family members and then to the media.

The commissioner was unable to say whether relatives of the victims were granted permission to bring in a US pathologist to conduct another autopsy, saying this was outside of his remit.

Earlier this month [May 2022] during a press conference Mr Rolle said samples were extracted from all of the persons "and our forensic scientists have collected those samples for examination. "We are actively engaging a lab in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to assist us with expediting the toxicological examinations of all of these samples," he said at the time.

"Once those examinations are done, our pathologist would be able to provide us with an official report as to the exact cause of death and help us to determine exactly what has happened.

"Our forensic scientists have also collected samples from both of the rooms and the properties of the Sandals hotel in Exuma to determine whether or not any contaminants are present."

The Tennessee couple and the man from Florida [whose wife was the lone survivor] were found dead in 2 separate villas at Sandals on [6 May 2022] after they were stricken by an unknown illness.

Officials say the 2 men and 1 woman died sometime between 11 pm on [5 May 2022] when they, along with the lone survivor, visited the clinic seeking medical attention for nausea and vomiting, and around 8.30 am to 9 am the next morning [6 May 2022], when they were found dead in 2 separate villas.

Deputy Prime Minister Chester Cooper previously told reporters autopsies of the American victims had already been completed. However, he noted the findings have not been released.

Following this, Health and Wellness Minister Dr Michael Darville said there were still some ongoing investigations at the resort, but relatives wanted to bring in a pathologist.

"We also have the pathologists in (the) country who have done their job and samples were sent to a very reliable lab in the United States and a toxicology report was still outstanding."

"There were requests by family members of the deceased to bring in pathologists from abroad to do another autopsy because you know to move bodies across water, they have to be embalmed and so the request was made. I do not know exactly how far it has gone but we are willing to assist anyone who wants to get to the bottom [of the deaths] of their loved ones and so those requests are being entertained but I'm not sure where they are at this point."

[We often think about arterial blood as being bright red because of the oxygen level, while venous blood is often considered to appear darker. But carbon monoxide can cause venous blood to appear redder. Unfortunately, this is not always obvious in some human beings. Skin color, smoking, lifestyle (sedentary vs athletic), and other co-morbidities all affect the appearance of the arterial and venous blood in human beings.

"The colour of the altered blood depends on the way the red cells are massed together, their depth below the surface, and the brightness of the background against which they are viewed. These phenomena were compared with the dichroism of oxyhemoglobin. Damage to eccrine sweat acini [major sweat glands, found in virtually all skin] was noted early in CO-poisoning. It was probably intensified, in those surviving longer, at skin sites of intermittent pressure anoxia." (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3408663/)

"Signs and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include:
- Dull headache
- Weakness
- Dizziness
- Nausea or vomiting
- Shortness of breath
- Confusion
- Blurred vision
- Loss of consciousness

Carbon monoxide poisoning can be particularly dangerous for people who are sleeping or intoxicated. People may have irreversible brain damage or even die before anyone realizes there's a problem." (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carbon-monoxide/symptoms-causes/syc-20370642)

According to the report above, the guests sought medical attention for nausea and vomiting.

We express our sympathies to their families.

The Bahamas, a sovereign country in the West Indies in the Atlantic, consists of more than 3000 islands. It is located north of Cuba and southeast of the US state of Florida (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas). The capital, Nassau, is on the island of New Providence. Exuma is a district of The Bahamas, consisting of several hundred islands, the largest of which is Great Exuma (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exuma). A map showing the location of Grand Exuma can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/v7g75cXsBBePQxNQ7. - Mod.TG]

[A recent news report said that the 2 couples were staying in "separate villas", near each other, and that "Bahamian authorities concluded the cause was an isolated incident in one standalone structure that housed 2 guest rooms" (https://www.wvlt.tv/2022/05/25/sandals-resorts-installs-carbon-monoxide-detectors-following-death-3/). Another recent news article said, "Investigators are still working to determine how the victims got carbon monoxide poisoning. Hotel guests allegedly reported smelling a strong odor, and investigators looked into a possible air conditioning or water heater leak. Still, at this point, they have no comment and are only confirming the cause of death" (https://www.wvnstv.com/news/carbon-monoxide-killed-sandals-tourists-in-bahamas-reports/).

We will await further findings from the investigation. - Mod.ML
