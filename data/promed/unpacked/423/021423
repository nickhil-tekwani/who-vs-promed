Background on Hantavirus Infections in Taiwan from the Gideon Database
----------------------------------------------------------------------
No cases were officially reported in 1994. Of 41 cases reported in 1995 (7
from Taipei), only one (imported) was confirmed. Fifty-six cases (1
confirmed - an imported case) were reported in 1996, 98 cases (2 confirmed
- imported cases) were reported in 1997.
Seropositivity rates against Hantaan virus are 11.5% among Orchid Islands
aboriginals, 11.6% among Penghu Islets Fukien Taiwanese), and 2.5% among
Hakka Taiwanese. [Among occupational groups 1.55% of garbage collectors are
seropositive (against either Hantaan-like or Seoul-like hantaviruses),
3.45% of animal handlers, 5.56% of field rats. Rates are highest in the
west and among Fukien Chinese and lowest in the South and among Mainland
Chinese. Rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) nfected with Seoul virus were found in
Wu-Chi Harbor in 1998.
