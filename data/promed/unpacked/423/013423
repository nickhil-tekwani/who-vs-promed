Rabies in a puppy in Nyon, Switzerland
--------------------------------------
In May 2003, an abandoned puppy of unknown origin, a few weeks of age, was
found on a road and brought to an animal shelter in the canton of Geneva,
Switzerland. On 25 Jun 2003, the dog was adopted by a family living in the
canton of Vaud, and began to show neurological symptoms on 15 July. Because
of the progressive course combined with aggressive behaviour, the dog was
euthanised on 19 Jul 2003 and submitted for laboratory analysis on 21 July.
Rabies was confirmed in the dog by direct immunofluorescence on 24 July.
The last indigenous case of rabies in a dog in Switzerland was linked to
fox rabies and was diagnosed in December 1996. There was no history of
international travel or importation from abroad in this case. In 1997,
rabies was found in a dog imported from Morocco [see refs]. Before that,
rabies cases in dogs were rarely observed, and were single spillover cases
from sylvatic rabies.
Rabies was epizootic in Switzerland from 1967 to 1996, but due to the
mandatory vaccination of all dogs aged over 5 months, dogs represented only
a minority (4.2 per cent) of all cases observed in domestic animals during
that time. According to post-vaccination surveillance of wildlife rabies in
Europe as defined by the World Health Organization and the World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), Switzerland has officially been free
of terrestrial rabies since early 1999. Since then, no rabies cases have
been observed apart from a case in a bat (European Bat Lyssavirus) detected
in September 2002. This was only the third rabies case diagnosed in a bat
in Switzerland since the emergence of bat rabies in Europe in the 1980s.
Bat rabies is an important though minor residual rabies risk, which
persists in the absence of terrestrial rabies. The most likely origin of
the current case in the puppy is illegal importation from a region of the
world with urban rabies. Characterisation of the viral strain is under way.
This case underlines the importance of risk minimisation by new regulations
for the cross-border transport of dogs (vaccinate, serologically test, and
observe). These have already been implemented in several European countries
and more countries will implement them in the near future. This is of
particular importance in view of the recent and future expansion of the
European Union into areas where rabies control was of lower priority than
in Western Europe. At the same time, strong support for effective rabies
control in terrestrial mammals throughout the European region will be
crucial, as it is impossible to prevent foxes from crossing national
borders. Table [truncated to include only cases since 1991.- Mod. AS].

[Switzerland is the first country where the efficacy of oral vaccination in
foxes was successfully demonstrated in field experiments, as early as 1978.
The last rabies case in a wild animal was recorded there in fall 1996;
consequently, the oral vaccination programme was discontinued after the
spring 1998 campaign. The eradication of rabies from wildlife will not
preclude sporadic cases in imported domestic carnivores, as already
demonstrated in Switzerland in 1997 and in France in 1999 (see refs). As
indicated by the authors, the current case is, most probably, also an
(illegally) imported one; the genetic characteristics of the virus will
indicate the likely geographical origin of this rabid puppy.
