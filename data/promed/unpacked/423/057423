France reported 2 new cases of mad cow disease (BSE) on
Monday, bringing the number of cattle found with the illness in
France to 24 this year, 23 of those being French-born.
The farm ministry said 1 case occurred in a herd of 32 in Finistere,
at the western tip of Brittany, and the other in a 148-strong herd in
the Oise region, north of Paris.
Both animals and their respective herds were destroyed, the
ministry said in a statement.
The ministry said the 2 animals in question, born in June 1994 and
October 1992, may have been infected by consuming feed not
destined for cattle.
France in 1990 banned nervous tissue, ground bone and certain
organs from being used in French cattle feed, the ministry said.
The French government has said the number of fresh BSE cases
should die down after 2001, as the disease's incubation period is 5
years and even tougher controls were placed on animal feed in late
1996. France has a total cattle herd of about 21 million.
