Although the outbreaks seem to be contained to one region of the Czech Republic, African Swine Fever [ASF] continues to make victims among the country's wild boar population.

The total amount of dead wild boars discovered in the woods around Zlín, in the far east of the Czech Republic, stood at 94 at the end of August [2017]. In this month, 23 new infected carcasses were found, which is a downward trend from July [2017], when 68 reports were sent to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The 1st report of ASF in Czech wild boars was on [Wed 21 Jun 2017].

Many neighbouring countries have alerted their local pig producers to be very careful what to feed their pigs - and their inhabitants what to purchase and how to dispose of it. So did Slovakia, according to the Slovak Spectator. Zlín is only a few km away from the western Slovak border, to its north is Poland where ASF has been around since 2014 and on its eastern border is Ukraine, where ASF has been confirmed since 2011.

In a presentation, given in mid-July [2017] to the European Commission's Standing Committee On Animals, Plants, Food and Feed (SCoPAFF), Dr Petr Šatrán of the Czech State Veterinary Administration indicated that human activities are most likely the cause of the spread of the virus, seeing that the nearest reported cases of ASF were roughly 500 km [310.68 mi] away and that the positive dead wild boars were found in inhabited areas.

In the other country where ASF was found for the 1st time in 2017, Romania, things appear relatively quiet. News broke early this month [August 2017] that ASF was also found on 2 backyard farms in the north of the country. Ever since, the Romanian authorities did not report any further outbreaks of ASF to the OIE.

Of all other countries in the European Union, especially Poland has continued to report outbreaks of African Swine Fever in smaller and middle-sized operations. In August alone, on 23 farm sites of various sizes, ASF was found to have infected at least one animal, after which the entire herd would have to be culled.

The biggest operation in this respect was a farm near Monki, Podlaskie province, where all remaining 431 pigs had to be culled after 11 had died as a result of ASF, on [Sat 19 Aug 2017]. Noteworthy as well was the ASF-related closure of 2 farms in Lack, Lubelskie province, in early August. These farms had 136 and 141 pigs respectively [see also item 2].

[2] Poland, fence considered

Poland wants to build along the border with Belarus and Ukraine a fence preventing migration of wild boars -- carriers of the African Swine fever [ASF]. This was said by Poland's Minister of Agriculture, Krzysztof Yurgel, Niezalezna reports.

As reported, the length of the fence will be 729 km [452.98 mi], costing Poland 130 million zloties (more than 36.2 million USD). The final decision on a fence will be made within the next 3 weeks.

According to experts, ASF has developed in the territory of Poland "thanks to" the wild boars who entered from Belarus.

[The accumulated ASF OIE data from Poland as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, are as follows (start of event 22 May 2014):
Number of follow-up reports: 189
Total outbreaks: 550 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Killed and disposed of/ Slaughtered
Wild boar/ - / 620 / 620 / 0 / 0
Domestic Swine/ 6303/ 402/ 188/ 6097/ 0

A map showing ASF cases reported globally to the OIE since 1 Jan 2017, as of Thu 31 Aug 2017, is available at http://tinyurl.com/ybexasqm.
Click on the European cluster, zoom in to each of the countries of interest.

EU disease control measures require designation of risk areas as Part I (wild boar at risk, but no cases found), Part II (wild boar testing positive but no spill over into domestic pigs), Part III (cases in wild boar and occasional spill over into domestic pigs) and Part IV which concerns the island of Sardinia only. Consignments of live pigs, live wild boars, meat of either source and animal by-products of either source are only allowed under certain derogations. For a full explanation, see European Commission Implementing Decision 2014/708/EU.

ASF, a viral disease against which no vaccine has become available so far, is currently threatening central and western Europe, where dense populations of wild boar are present.

According to a recent update of DEFRA (UK) ASF situation assessment, the continuing cases in the Czech Republic, the spread in Poland which appears to be due to several breakdowns in biosecurity and the new outbreaks in Romania are "concerning". This signifies a spread in geographic distribution, a possible drop in biosecurity awareness and therefore an increase in the weight of infection in East Europe.

Despite the relatively low level of trade in live pigs, there could be a substantial movement of people, vehicles and personal imports of pork products, therefore the risk of ASF introduction to the UK has been raised from "very low" (that is, "rare but could occur") to "low".

The Russian veterinary watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor believes ASF will keep moving west via 2 main pathways. The southerly route, has already seen the virus spread from Ukraine to Moldova. Russian vets believe it could penetrate central Romania, then move to the Balkans, including Bulgaria and Serbia.

On the northern route, now that ASF has been found in the Czech Republic, Rosselkhoznadzor believes, if it gains a foothold, it is likely to head further west, with Germany next in the firing line. The said is included in a recent update by the Russian journalist Vladislav Vorotnikov, available at http://www.pig-world.co.uk/comment/where-next-for-african-swine-fever.html. - Mod.AS]
