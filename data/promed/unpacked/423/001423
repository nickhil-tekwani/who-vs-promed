South-central Pennsylvania deer tests positive for chronic wasting disease
------------------------------------------------------------------
The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture announced today [Fri 13 Jan 2016] that a captive deer has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Pennsylvania. This is the 1st new case in a captive deer farm since 2014.

The 4 year old white-tailed deer was harvested from a hunting preserve in Franklin County in November 2016. Samples from this deer tested positive for the disease at the Pennsylvania Veterinary Laboratory in Harrisburg. The test results were confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa on [Thu 5 Jan 2017].

This deer was raised on a deer farm in Fulton County until it was sold to the Franklin County facility in August 2016. Both farms are under quarantine. The investigation continues and additional herds may be quarantined.

"We are working to minimize the risk to Pennsylvania's deer herd by quarantining both farms and tracing any contacts with other deer in our efforts to find the source of CWD, if possible," said agriculture secretary Russell C Redding. "We want to stress that CWD is no danger to public health and has never been associated as a human health concern."

[Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been detected in 3 locations in Pennsylvania: a captive deer farm in Adams County (fall 2012, see URL below for PDF); free-ranging deer in Blair and Bedford counties (2012 firearms season, see URL below for PDF); and a captive deer farm in Jefferson county (spring 2014, see URL below for PDF). Following the detection of CWD in both captive and free-ranging deer in Pennsylvania, an executive order (see URL below for PDF) was issued by the Game Commission to establish disease management areas (DMAs). Within DMAs, rehabilitation of cervids (deer, elk and moose); the use or possession of cervid urine-based attractants in an outdoor setting; the removal of high-risk cervid parts; and the feeding of wild, free-ranging cervids are prohibited. Increased testing continues in these areas to determine the distribution of the disease. Newly confirmed cases will alter the boundaries of DMAs as the Game Commission continues to manage the disease and minimize its affect on free ranging cervids.

This county appears to be new to the DMAs, but with a captive deer the question may really be, if the disease originated in another part of the state. Since the source herd and the herd where it was diagnosed are both under quarantine, then hopefully the subsequent investigation will answer that question.
