[In yesterday's (24 Jan 2020) update, there were 259 new confirmed cases and 8 new deaths from the 29 provinces; today's figures are 444 new confirmed cases and 16 new deaths. Likewise there were 830 confirmed cases of pneumonia in 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including 177 severe cases and 25 deaths (24 in Hubei Province and 1 in Hebei Province). There were a total of 1072 suspected cases. In contrast, today (25 Jan 2020) there were a total of 1287 confirmed cases of pneumonia in 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), including 237 severe cases and 41 deaths (39 in Hubei Province, 1 Hebei Province, and 1 in Heilongjiang Province). There were a total of 1965 suspected cases were reported in 20 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities). Media and social media reports have markedly elevated estimates, one speculating that there have been 100 000 cases in Wuhan. There appears to be significant person-to-person transmission ongoing within this outbreak, and cases are occurring almost throughout China (in 29 of the 33 provinces).

[2] Wuhan City addresses Q & A re: available care
Date: Fri 24 Jan 2020

Reply of Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Committee on Several Issues Concerned by Citizens
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. There are many people who come to the fever clinic, and the observation beds are very tight. How [can you] allocate medical resources and strengthen the treatment to solve the outstanding problem of the fever clinic?

Answer: At present, the number of fever patients in the city is increasing. There is indeed a long queue of fever clinics and tight beds. For this reason, the city headquarters made an urgent study and decided to recruit related hospitals as designated hospitals for fever patients. Seven hospitals, including the Hankou Hospital, the Red Cross Hospital, the Western Hospital of the Pu'ai Hospital, the Seventh Hospital, the Ninth Hospital, the Wuchang Hospital, and the Fifth Hospital, have been recruited as a whole. More than 3000 beds were arranged to treat suspected and confirmed cases. At the same time, the city's 2nd-level and above general hospitals still need to set up fever clinics, carry out pre-checks and triages, and diagnose and treat general fever patients, and actively guide patients with fever with respiratory symptoms to the city's designated fever hospitals. It is expected that the tension in the consultation of fever patients will ease.

2. At present, Wuhan has adopted a "7 to 7" insurance system. Why do you want to do this? How does it work?

Answer: In order to strengthen the medical service capabilities of the 7 designated hospitals for fever patients, select the ministry, provincial and municipal hospitals (Tongji Hospital, Xiehe Hospital, Provincial People's Hospital, Wuhan University South-South Hospital, City First Hospital, City The Central Hospital and the No. 3 Hospital of the Municipality of the People's Republic of China) have supported 7 designated hospitals for fever patients. The director of the supporting hospital will temporarily serve as the director of the corresponding designated diagnosis and treatment hospital. S/He will be responsible for the personnel, finance, and material management of the designated diagnosis and treatment hospital, coordinate the deployment of hospital resources on both sides, and make every effort to treat the patient. The existing staff affiliation and administrative level remain unchanged. The medical staff of the designated diagnosis and treatment hospitals are all transferred to the diagnosis and treatment of fever patients. When the strength is insufficient, the supporting hospitals will deploy and enrich them.

3. Many hospitals report that there are no results within a few days after the specimens are submitted for inspection, which affects the rapid diagnosis. What is the reason? How [can you] improve the detection speed next?

Answer: As the country has incorporated pneumonitis of the new type of coronavirus into a Class B infectious disease and adopted Class A management, the detection of samples of this type of pathogen is managed in accordance with highly pathogenic microorganisms (Class 2), and the relevant samples are tested and transported. It must meet the relevant requirements of biosafety management, and pathogen-related experimental activities should be carried out in a biosafety laboratory with the corresponding protection level.

In the early stage, the sample detection process for suspected cases was as follows: The 1st-patient hospital passed a standardized pre-test and triage, combined with clinical examination, laboratory inspection and chest imaging examination, confirmed the suspected case after sampling by the expert group, and sampled the disease. The control center will transfer the samples to the city's disease control center, and the city's disease control center will transfer to the provincial disease control center for nucleic acid detection. More than 200 samples can be detected every day. (Before [16 Jan 2020], there was no kit in our province, and it had to be sent to the national designated testing institution for virus isolation and nucleic acid detection.) It is estimated that it will take about 2 days from the start of sampling to the return of results (Before [16 Jan 2020], the samples had to be sent to the testing institution designated by the state of Beijing, and the results would take about 3-5 days to return).

In order to meet the needs of the current prevention and control situation and increase the speed of testing, upon requesting the consent of the relevant higher authorities, since [22 Jan 2020], the city has designated various designated treatment hospitals, counterpart assistance hospitals for fever fixed diagnosis and treatment hospitals, and the city's disease control center. Waiting for biosafety laboratories with corresponding protection levels to carry out the detection of pathogenic nucleic acids of related samples (the 1st batch of a total of 10 institutions), it is estimated that nearly 2000 samples can be detected every day when all are run. To this end, the city plans to urgently transport 30 000 kits to the designated testing institutions and has so far issued 6000 copies.

4. Managing close contacts of pneumonia infected by new coronavirus is an effective means to control the spread of the disease. How does Wuhan manage the close contacts of pneumonitis infected by new coronavirus? How many of the close contacts were diagnosed with pneumonitis infected by a new coronavirus?

Answer: At the beginning of the outbreak, our city strictly regulated and organized the judgment, assignment, follow-up, and disposal of close contacts. The specific methods are summarized as follows:

(1) Full inclusion and full coverage. All persons who work with, observe, suspect, or diagnose with cases who work, study, live together with others, and who are in close contact with each other, and those who perform medical and nursing care of the cases, are tracked and investigated as close contacts. One person is missing.

(2) Territorialization and gridding. Mainly based on the current place of residence, timely and accurately hand over close contacts to the residential jurisdiction for management. The districts assign personnel lists to the grid management team to ensure that they receive standardized medical observations.

(3) 5-3-1: 5 items given to each close contact, 3 people in the medical observation team, and visit 1 time per day. Each close contact is provided with a prevention and control knowledge manual, a pair of masks, a thermometer, a temperature detection table, and a recording pen. The medical observation team is composed of community leaders, community doctors, and community grid members who enter the household daily (at least once a day), monitor daily, and report information in a timely manner. The observation period (14 days) is over, and the medical observation will be lifted after passing the assessment.

(4) Report in time and rule in time. When the close contacts have abnormal conditions such as fever (37.3 deg C and above), cough, etc., immediately report them, and report them step by step. Immediately deploy an ambulance to transfer them to the designated hospital for treatment. As of 24:00 on [22 Jan 2020], the number of close contacts increased by 260 on that day, a total of 1441 close contacts were tracked, 779 medical observations have been lifted, and 662 people are still receiving medical observations. There were 46 people with close fever symptoms, 10 were excluded, 35 were waiting to be queued, and 1 was suspected.

[The media has chosen a sensationalist approach to the observation that the medical facilities are currently overwhelmed with the influx of febrile patients fearing the worst. Much has been written about hospital closings, lack of supplies for treatment and protective items (masks, gloves) for hospital staff. The above document attempts to address these through delineating the care structure in Wuhan. As part of pandemic preparedness, surge control is a critical management step. The above document seems to address much of the concerns, but on paper and in practice may be a challenge. - Mod.MPP]

Summary
-------
Background: A recent cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, was caused by a novel betacoronavirus, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes of these patients.

Methods: All patients with suspected 2019-nCoV were admitted to a designated hospital in Wuhan. We prospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection by real-time RT-PCR and next-generation sequencing. Data were obtained with standardised data collection forms shared by the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium from electronic medical records. Researchers also directly communicated with patients or their families to ascertain epidemiological and symptom data. Outcomes were also compared between patients who had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and those who had not.

Findings: By [2 Jan 2020], 41 admitted hospital patients had been identified as having laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (8 [20%]), hypertension (6 [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (6 [15%]). Median age was 49.0 years (IQR 41.0-58.0); 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market. One family cluster was found. Common symptoms at onset of illness were fever (40 [98%] of 41 patients), cough (31 [76%]), and myalgia or fatigue (18 [44%]); less common symptoms were sputum production (11 [28%] of 39), headache (3 [8%] of 38), haemoptysis (2 [5%] of 39), and diarrhoea (1 [3%] of 38). Dyspnoea developed in 22 (55%) of 40 patients (median time from illness onset to dyspnoea 8.0 days [IQR 5.0-13.0]); 26 (63%) of 41 patients had lymphopenia. All 41 patients had pneumonia with abnormal findings on chest CT. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia* (6 [15%]), acute cardiac injury (5 [12%]) and secondary infection (4 [10%]); 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and 6 (15%) died. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had higher plasma levels of IL2 [interleukin-2], IL7 [interleukin-7], IL10 [interleukin-10], GSCF [granulocyte colony-stimulating factor], IP10 [inducible protein], MCP1 [monocyte chemotactic protein-1], MIP1A [macrophage inflammatory protein], and TNFalpha [tumor necrosis factor].

Interpretation: The 2019-nCoV infection caused clusters of severe respiratory illness similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Major gaps in our knowledge of the origin, epidemiology, duration of human transmission, and clinical spectrum of disease need fulfilment by future studies.

*Since we did not perform tests for detecting infectious virus in blood, we avoided the term viraemia and used RNAaemia instead. RNAaemia was defined as a positive result for real-time RT-PCR in the plasma sample.

[As the authors conclude, the 2019-nCoV clinical picture includes clusters of severe respiratory illness that is very similar to the severe disease seen with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). This article is one of the 1st full discussions of the clinical presentation and is definitely worth reading. - Mod.MPP]

Summary
-------
In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China. A previously unknown betacoronavirus was discovered through the use of unbiased sequencing in samples from patients with pneumonia. Human airway epithelial cells were used to isolate a novel coronavirus, named 2019-nCoV, which formed another clade within the subgenus sarbecovirus, Orthocoronavirinae subfamily. Different from both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV is the 7th member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Enhanced surveillance and further investigation are ongoing. (Funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China and the National Major Project for Control and Prevention of Infectious Disease in China.)

Discussion
----------
We report a novel CoV (2019-nCoV) that was identified in hospitalized patients in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. Evidence for the presence of this virus includes identification in bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid in 3 patients by whole-genome sequencing, direct PCR, and culture. The illness likely to have been caused by this CoV was named "novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia" (NCIP). Complete genomes were submitted to GASAID. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV falls into the genus betacoronavirus, which includes coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, bat SARS-like CoV, and others) discovered in humans, bats, and other wild animals (15 [see source URL for complete reference list]). We report isolation of the virus and the initial description of its specific cytopathic effects and morphology.

Molecular techniques have been used successfully to identify infectious agents for many years. Unbiased, high-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool for the discovery of pathogens (14,16). Next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics are changing the way we can respond to infectious disease outbreaks, improving our understanding of disease occurrence and transmission, accelerating the identification of pathogens, and promoting data sharing. We describe in this report the use of molecular techniques and unbiased DNA sequencing to discover a novel betacoronavirus that is likely to have been the cause of severe pneumonia in 3 patients in Wuhan, China.

Further development of accurate and rapid methods to identify unknown respiratory pathogens is still needed. On the basis of analysis of 3 complete genomes obtained in this study, we designed several specific and sensitive assays targeting ORF1ab, N, and E regions of the 2019-nCoV genome to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens. The primer sets and standard operating procedures have been shared with the World Health Organization and are intended for surveillance and detection of 2019-nCoV infection globally and in China. More recent data show 2019-nCoV detection in 830 persons in China (17).

Although our study does not fulfill Koch's postulates, our analyses provide evidence implicating 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan outbreak. Additional evidence to confirm the etiologic significance of 2019-nCoV in the Wuhan outbreak include[s] identification of a 2019-nCoV antigen in the lung tissue of patients by immunohistochemical analysis, detection of IgM and IgG antiviral antibodies in the serum samples from a patient at 2 time points to demonstrate seroconversion, and animal (monkey) experiments to provide evidence of pathogenicity. Of critical importance are epidemiologic investigations to characterize transmission modes, reproduction interval, and clinical spectrum resulting from infection to inform and refine strategies that can prevent, control, and stop the spread of 2019-nCoV.

A young, healthy man from Wuhan and a person living 1500 miles from the epicenter of the coronavirus are among the latest victims of the outbreak, which has incited fear and anger across China as the important Spring Festival gets underway. Reports of 8 new deaths from the pneumonia-like virus, taking the total to 26, came as authorities enforced a lockdown across large parts of the province of Hubei, population 59 million. But they also came as the medical system clearly struggled to cope with the outbreak, with reports of crowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies.

Amid increasing talk that the real number of deaths and infections could be much higher than the official figures, the State Council, the Chinese equivalent of the cabinet, vowed to "seriously handle" underreporting of cases.

Some details about the latest deaths in China have raised concerns about the virus's spread. Until now, the vast majority of the victims had been older than 60, and almost all of them had existing health conditions. All had been in Hubei province and especially in its capital, Wuhan.

But the latest announcement said that a 36-year-old man from Wuhan died on Thursday [23 Jan 2020]. He had no chronic diseases or other existing health conditions and had been treated with anti-virus medication and antibiotics since being admitted to a hospital on [9 Jan 2020].

Another death occurred in Suihua in Heilongjiang province, near the border with Russia and some 1500 miles from Wuhan.

Three cases of the coronavirus have been "confirmed" in France, the 1st in Europe, officials said Friday [24 Jan 2020]. The 1st case involved a patient in hospital in the southwestern city of Bordeaux while the other was in Paris, French Health Minister Agnes Buzyn told reporters. A 3rd person, who is a close relative of one of the other 2, has also been confirmed to have the virus, the health ministry said later.

All 3 had recently traveled to China and had now been placed in isolation. "We are in the process of tracing the history of these patients who have tested positive in order to get in touch with the people they have been in contact with," Buzyn said earlier.

"We have today the 1st European cases probably because we developed the test very quickly and we are capable of identifying them."

The 1st patient, 48, who returned to France on [22 Jan 2020] after having "passed through Wuhan," the Chinese city at the center of the deadly outbreak, was described as "well." "We know that since the patient has been on French soil they have had contact with a dozen people, we are going to contact them."

She said she had only just received information on the 2nd case and was not yet in a position to make it public. "You have to treat an epidemic as you treat a fire, quickly to locate the source" and "contain it as quickly as possible," Buzyn added.

Three people have been confirmed to have the Wuhan coronavirus in Malaysia, Malaysian Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said on Saturday ([25 Jan 2020]), marking the 1st cases there of the potentially deadly disease. The 3 Chinese citizens, who entered Malaysia via Johor Baru, are the wife and grandchildren of a 66-year-old man from Wuhan who is currently being treated in Singapore for the same virus. The 3 patients have since been transferred to Sungai Buloh Hospital in Selangor, said Datuk Seri Dzulkefly.

The patients were said to have boarded a plane from Guangzhou to Singapore on [20 Jan 2020]. The 66-year-old man and his son tested positive for the virus and were admitted to hospital in Singapore on [22 Jan 2020].

There were a total of 9 people in the group who were travelling together with the 1st male patient: his wife, son, daughter-in-law, 2 grandchildren and another family of 4 comprising husband and wife and 2 children.

They were quarantined upon arrival in Johor while awaiting test results for the virus. Initial tests had found that they were not experiencing fever or any other symptoms.

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200124-sitrep-4-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=9272d086_2


Summary
-------
Situation update:
- A total of 846 confirmed cases have been reported for novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) globally;
- Of the 846 cases reported, 830 cases were reported from China;
- 11 confirmed cases have been reported outside of China in 6 countries (see Table 1 at source URL);
- Of these 11 confirmed cases, 10 had travel history to Wuhan;
- 1 confirmed case in Viet Nam had no travel history to any part of China but was a family member of a confirmed case who visited Wuhan. This suggests an instance of human-to-human transmission that occurred in Viet Nam.
- Of the 830 confirmed cases in China, 375 cases were confirmed from Hubei Province
- Of the 830 cases, 177 cases have been reported as severely ill (severe illness according to any of the following criteria: [1] dyspnea; [2] respiratory rate more than 30 bpm; [3] hypoxemia; [4] chest X-ray with multi-lobar infiltrates or pulmonary infiltration progressed more than 50% within 24-48 hours);
- 25 deaths have been reported to date;
- On [24 Jan 2020], the number of reported confirmed cases of 2019-nCoV has increased by 265 cases since the last situation report published on 23 Jan 2020, including China which reported additional 259 confirmed cases.

New epidemiological information reinforces the evidence that the 2019-nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another. During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus [Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)], human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be similar. The strategic objectives of the response are to interrupt the transmission of the virus from one person to another in China, to prevent exportation of cases from China to other countries and territories, and to prevent further transmission from exported case if they were to happen. This can be achieved through a combination of public health measures, such as rapid identification, diagnosis and management of the cases, identification and follow up of the contacts, infection prevention and control in healthcare settings, implementation of health measures for travellers, awareness raising in the population, risk communication.
