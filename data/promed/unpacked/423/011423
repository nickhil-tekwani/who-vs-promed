Situation report on atypical pneumonia 27 Apr 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority: As of 1 PM 27 Apr 2003, there are an additional 16
patients confirmed to have atypical pneumonia following admission to public
hospitals earlier. They include 2 health care workers (one from Caritas
Medical Centre and one from Tuen Mun Hospital). The remaining 14 are other
patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 668 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 36 were discharged today.
There are also 115 recovering patients who are in convalescence and
preparing for discharge. 100 patients are being treated in intensive care
units.
12 patients died in Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, Prince of Wales
Hospital, Kwong Wah Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, Tuen Mun
Hospital, Tai Po Hospital, and United Christian Hospital. This brought to
133 the total number of deaths related to atypical pneumonia. The deceased
are aged from 45 to 91 and include 8 women and 4 men. 8 of them have a
history of chronic disease. [None of these deaths was in an otherwise
healthy individual less than 50 years of age.]
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases / total no. discharged patients / total no. deaths
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students: 347 / 147 / ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1196 / 521 / ?

Situation Update on SARS 27 Apr 2003
------------------------------------
Today, only one new SARS case has been reported. The patient was a
physician who died on 22 Apr 2003. Postmortem results confirmed his case as
SARS. Besides this, there are no other new cases. 3 more patients have been
discharged, bringing the total number of patients who have recovered from
SARS to 131; 47 SARS patients remain hospitalised, of whom 17 are in
intensive care.
"No visitor" rule
Starting from 29 Apr 2003, all public hospitals will implement a no visitor
rule for their patients. Of the 199 SARS cases reported so far, about 38
per cent of them were visitors to hospitals. The no visitor rule is an
added precautionary measure to cut down the chances of visitors being
infected while in the hospital. It will also help prevent infection from
being brought out of the hospitals into the community at large The no
visitor rule will not apply for departments or hospitals treating children
or providing obstetric care, where the 1-visitor-per-patient-per-day policy
will continue.
Postmortem results of the physician fatality
[A] consultant vascular surgeon with the Department of General Surgery,
Singapore General Hospital (SGH), passed away on 22 Apr 2003. [He] may have
been infected by a critically ill patient from the Ward 57 & 58 cohort,
whom he cared for during the week of 7 to 13 Apr 2003. A postmortem was
carried out on 23 Apr 2003 [? date]. Postmortem testing of tissues
subsequently confirmed SARS.
Pasir Panjang Wholesale Market (PPWM): update
On 19 Apr 2003, PPWM was closed down when 2 workers with probable SARS were
identified. These 2 had come in contact with the brother of the SGH index
case who worked in PPWM. Active contact tracing was initiated immediately
to trace all people who might have come into close contact with the 3 SARS
cases. A total of 1825 people who had frequented the market between 5 and
19 Apr 2003 were identified as possible contacts, and they comprised 935
tenants and stall holders, 553 employees and workers, and 337 regular
customers. As a precautionary measure, these people were placed under home
quarantine and monitored for fever for 10 days from 20 to 29 Apr 2003. The
quarantine will be lifted on 30 Apr 2003. There have been no new probable
cases related to PPWM since 26 Apr 2003. Today 4 more suspect cases (3
visitors and 1 worker) related to the PPWM have been discharged. There are
currently 10 suspect cases admitted in relation to PPWM. They consist of 8
visitors and 2 family & friend contacts.
Summary of SARS Cases
Discharged: 131
Hospitalised: 47 (including 17 in intensive care)
Deaths: 21+1 (pending further investigations)
Probable cases: 199
Suspect cases: 111 (including 9 children under the age of 18)
Under home quarantine: 2836

[B] SARS epidemiological summaries: SARS among Ontario health care workers
26 Apr 2003 [edited]
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/pef-dep/sars-es20030426_e.html>
Transmission of SARS in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is believed to have
begun with a travel-related index case in February 2003. Her family
contacts, after developing symptoms compatible with SARS, were treated at a
hospital within the GTA and subsequently transmitted the illness to
hospital workers and other patients at that hospital. Over 100 hospital
workers at 3 GTA hospitals have since become ill. Initial descriptive
epidemiology suggests that transmission occurred in association with the
care of patients who were not diagnosed with SARS and were not in isolation
precautions, as well as ill family members visiting in hospital.
Disease control strategies included implementation of strict infection
control precautions in institutional settings, isolation of cases and
symptomatic contacts, and quarantining asymptomatic close contacts.
Initially, SARS cases were isolated in hospital in negative pressure rooms.
By early April 2003, however, there was a critical shortage of standard
airborne isolation beds within the GTA. In response, SARS negative pressure
units were created within some GTA hospitals to increase capacity to care
for SARS patients in controlled circumstances.
Since these control strategies were implemented, transmission of SARS to
hospital workers has decreased substantially. Nevertheless, transmission
has continued to occur in both high and low risk hospital settings within
the GTA despite these measures. High risk procedures have been identified
and include intubation, suction, nebulized aerosol therapy, and positive
pressure non-invasive ventilation. Transmission of SARS to hospital staff
during difficult intubations of SARS patients has occurred in 3 different
hospitals. In 2, undiagnosed patients were identified as the source of
transmission for 7 hospital staff. Although infection control precautions
were in place, compliance may not have been complete. In the third, a SARS
patient was identified as the source of infection for 7 hospital staff; an
additional 6 remain under investigation. Although staff were reportedly
compliant with infection control precautions, one break in technique in one
caregiver was identified (a face shield was accidentally dislodged).
Transmission of SARS to 10 to 11 hospital staff has also been identified in
lower risk settings. Affected staff include physicians, nurses, and service
assistants (such as porter/housekeeper) working in 4 different low risk
SARS units and one community hospital. Initial investigation suggests that
transmission occurred while staff were wearing required personal protective
equipment and following all recommended infection control precautions.
In response to the continued transmission of SARS to hospital workers,
Health Canada is leading an urgent investigation in collaboration with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Province of Ontario,
and Toronto Public Health. The investigation will include descriptive
epidemiology, case control studies, air ventilation studies, and surface
contamination studies. In addition, an infection control directive
specifically for SARS Units is being developed.
[C] Epidemiology update: interim report on the SARS outbreak in the Greater
Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada 24 Apr 2003
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/sars-sras/pef-dep/gta-20030424_e.html>
1. Background
SARS, a new atypical pneumonia, originated in Guangdong Province, China in
November 2002. This syndrome appears to have some association with
infection with a novel coronavirus. While isolated travel-related cases
have been reported in Greater Toronto Area (GTA) and other parts of Canada,
progression to a large outbreak occurred in Toronto in March 2003
originating from a single traveler who returned from Hong Kong in late
February.
The outbreak now involves more than 250 people in the province of Ontario.
Health Canada is currently working with international partners in
investigating reports of SARS cases exposed in Canada and diagnosed
elsewhere. Countries include Australia, Philippines, United States,
Germany, and Bulgaria. A summary of the international investigations
associated with travel to Canada will be reported separately. This interim
report describes the current results of the epidemiological investigation
of the SARS outbreak in the GTA.
The outbreak in the GTA has proceeded through 5 major stages, listed below:
- spread of SARS infection within the family of the index case;
- amplification of the SARS outbreak through hospital-based spread;
- transmission within immediate household members of the health care
workers, patients, and visitors to these hospitals;
- isolated sporadic cases due to limited transmission in the workplace;
- transmission in an extended family and associated religious group.
The following provides an overview of the epidemiology of the outbreak in
the GTA as of 19 Apr 2003.
2. Spread of SARS infection within the family of the index case
The index case of SARS in Canada (case A) was a 78 year old woman who was
infected during a stay at a hotel in Kowloon district of Hong Kong between
17 and 21 Feb 2003. She returned to Toronto on 23 Feb 2003; there was no
transmission of SARS to other passengers on her return flight. The
infection spread to her family members, 3 of whom visited their family
physician, who also became ill. 6 of the 11 members of this family
developed develop SARS and 2 died. Poutanen SM and colleagues have
described these cases in the New England Journal of Medicine
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/NEJM.oa030634v3.pdf>. These events
occurred before 12 Mar 2003, at which time the World Health Organization
(WHO) issued an alert about SARS and initiated global surveillance.
3. Transmission in hospitals
3.1. Hospital A
The son (case B) of the index case presented with respiratory symptoms at
the emergency room (ER) of hospital A on 7 Mar 2003. He was managed in a
general observation area of the ER and received a bronchodilator via a
nebulizer. During this time, SARS was transmitted to 2 other patients who
were also in the ER general observation area (cases C and D).
Case C began to exhibit symptoms of SARS 3 days later. He was brought to
hospital A on 16 Mar 2003. Case C was admitted to the intensive care unit
(ICU and placed in isolation. On the same day, his wife also became ill.
SARS was transmitted to 2 paramedics and a firefighter by case C and to 4
ER staff, one housekeeper and 7 visitors who were in the ER at the same
time. The infection was also spread to 3 other members of the family. The 7
ER visitors transmitted the infection to 5 household members and other
family contacts. In the ICU, case C was intubated by a physician who wore a
face shield, mask, gown, and gloves when performing the procedure. He did
not use precautions when he was in contact with case C's wife. He
subsequently developed SARS and transmitted the infection to one member of
his family. In total, case C infected 15 other people.
Case D became ill on 13 Mar 2003 and was admitted to hospital A. He
presented with a myocardial infarction, SARS was not recognized, so
infection control precautions were not used. After 3 days in the Cardiac
Care Unit (CCU), he was transferred to hospital B. Case D transmitted the
infection to 11 people in hospital A, including a paramedic, ER staff, CCU
staff, and a CCU patient.
Due to the ongoing spread of infection in the hospital setting and concerns
that this potential for spread would result in more cases in hospital A,
hospital A was closed to new patients and active surveillance for SARS was
established. The crude attack rates in the ER were 13 per cent, the ICU 14
per cent, and the CCU 50 per cent.
3.2. Hospital B
Case D was transferred to the ICU of hospital B and was not placed in
isolation. Case D's wife was subsequently admitted to the surgical unit on
21 Mar 2003. The couple was assumed to be the source of the hospital
outbreak. Following the identification of 5 staff members ill with SARS,
strict infection control policies were applied. One staff member was a
dialysis nurse who worked one shift while symptomatic. Follow-up with
dialysis patients has failed to reveal any further transmission among this
group. A total of 9 staff and one patient were infected by case D and his wife.
4. Transmission in households
Transmission of SARS in the household settings has resulted in 33 cases.
From the analysis of the hospital A cluster of 129 cases, about 85
households were involved. Transmission to family members occurred in 21 of
those households (25 per cent).
5. Sporadic cases in workplaces
There have been 3 episodes in which occupational transmission of SARS has
been suspected in settings other than health care facilities. In one
worksite, a worker broke quarantine, became symptomatic, and worked with
one other person in a small room while symptomatic. This close contact
became a probable case of SARS. Possible exposures have occurred in 2 other
worksites, but at the time of writing this report, neither has evidence of
transmission of SARS.
6. Transmission in an extended family and religious group
The elderly grandfather of a large family was taken to the ER of hospital A
on the evening of 16 Mar 2003, at the same time that case C and his wife
were there. 3 members of this family developed SARS. The infection
subsequently spread to their extended family. The grandfather died on 1 Apr
2003. Visitation for this deceased person occurred on 3 Apr 2003 and ill
family members were in attendance.
Members of this family are also part of a religious group that engaged in
frequent worship and social activities. This group held 2 large church
events on 28 and 29 Mar 2003 attended by 500 and 250 people, respectively.
The attendees at the second event were a subset of those who attended the
first event. This family is also part of an extensive social network that
includes many extended families.
To date, a total of 31 probable and suspect cases of SARS have been
identified in this cluster. This number includes 14 members of the index
family, 3 health care workers, and 14 other members of the religious group.
Active surveillance and quarantine measures are being used to control the
spread of SARS outside of this group.
7. Epidemiological description of the outbreak as a whole
This section provides the descriptive epidemiology of the overall outbreak.
These data are presented as of 19 Apr 2003. At this time, there were 249
reported cases of SARS, of which 129 (52 per cent) were listed as probable.
7.1. Geographic location of residence
Cases of SARS have been reported by 4 of the 5 health units in GTA. The
city of Toronto and York region account for 84 per cent of all suspect and
probable cases.
7.2. Distribution by age and sex
Of the 249 reported cases, 155 (62 per cent) were female. This percentage
is the same for both suspect and probable cases and probably reflects the
demographics of workers in the health care system. The distribution by age
indicates a peak among people aged 36 to 64 years. This peak again reflects
the population who work in health care settings, which is one of the
largest risk groups for this outbreak. The mean and median ages are 44.6
and 42.0 years, respectively. There have been 12 reported cases of SARS
among children aged 16 and under.
7.3. Distribution over time
Figure 2 [see website link above] shows the distribution over time by
source of infection. There was early transmission in the family, followed
by a large increase in cases due to transmission at hospitals A and B. With
the introduction of infection control procedures and public health
measures, however, the number of new cases has decreased.
7.4. Incubation period
Based on the cases associated with hospital A, the incubation period ranges
from 2 to 10 days, with a mean of 5 days and median of 4. This incubation
period was calculated using 42 cases that had a single known contact with a
SARS case.
7.5. Period of communicability
There has been no observed transmission before the onset of symptoms.
7.6. Mortality
As of 19 Apr 2003, there have been 14 deaths associated with SARS. The age
of those who died ranged from 43 to 99 years of age (mean 74 years). Of
those with known medical histories, all deaths have been in those with an
associated medical condition. Further investigation is under way to
determine the factors that are associated with an increased risk of death.
7.7. Disposition of patients
As of 19 Apr 2003, 120 people with SARS (48 per cent) have been discharged
home following their illness. A further 4 have never been admitted to
hospital and 14 have died. The remaining people are in hospital being
treated or monitored. Data on the average length of stay and the percentage
of patients requiring ventilation are being collected for analysis.

From: Professor Paul Hunter <paul.hunter@uea.ac.uk>

In "SARS - worldwide (69): diagnostic testing" [20030425.1015], when
commenting on the Canadian results of positive samples in people with only
mild or no symptoms who had returned from high risk areas, you stated "This
discrepancy urgently needs to be resolved, as it casts doubt on the
sensitivity, specificity, and relevance of the current diagnostic
procedures." I do not think this judgement is correct.
Many -- and probably most -- infectious diseases cause a wide range of
disease severity, from asymptomatic through mild symptoms to severe and at
times lethal illness (just a few examples include Japanese B encephalitis,
West Nile fever, hepatitis A, etc.). Few would argue that someone with a
positive IgM test to hepatitis A associated with mild non-icteric illness
does not have hepatitis A infection simply because they are not jaundiced.
Syndromic diagnosis has low sensitivity and specificity compared to
laboratory diagnosis. Syndromes usually only represent the more severe tip
of the iceberg in any infectious disease.
Because the current definition of SARS is syndromic, many cases of
infection with the SARS agent are likely to be missed, because the severity
of the illness is not great enough to be classified as SARS. Also there are
other pathogens (some of which are difficult to identify in the laboratory
or may be currently unknown) that will cause a similar clinical picture in
severe cases and still be correctly classified as SARS -- even though not
due to the SARS agent. The Canadian results, far from casting doubt on the
sensitivity and specificity of current SARS-related coronavirus tests, are
consistent with what we should expect, especially away from the main focus
of the epidemic.
A lot of the confusion in the reporting of the SARS epidemic is caused by
people forgetting the difference between a clinical syndrome and an
infectious disease caused by a particular pathogen. I further suggest this
confusion may also be delaying a proper epidemiological investigation, as
no such investigation can be complete unless the underwater part of the
iceberg (non-SARS infections with the SARS agent) is fully investigated.

[Professor Hunter's comments have merit. The point we were trying to
emphasize is that there is no substitute for experimental data and that an
obvious control has not been included in the recommended diagnostic
protocol to date. We agree that syndromic surveillance alone does have a
low sensitivity and specificity when compared with laboratory diagnosis of
an infection. In the case of the ongoing SARS epidemic, and in the quest to
identify an etiologic agent and appropriate laboratory diagnostic tools to
confirm the infection, there remains cause for concern if, in the middle of
an outbreak of an unusual pneumonia, only 40 per cent of the "probable
cases" are positive using the currently available laboratory diagnostic
tools. It would be highly unusual to have so many epidemiologically linked
cases with an "atypical pneumonia" that would not be caused by the same
etiology. Yes, we do expect to see mild cases and asymptomatics that are
also positive, so that the absence of a healthy control group not
epidemiologically linked to this outbreak is lamentably lacking in this
scientific process. Nevertheless, a 60 per cent false (?) negative rate is
a bit disconcerting and warrants further study. - Mods.CP/MPP]

The North was put on alert as a patient suspected to have been infected
with the epidemic was reported in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
North Korea's Central TV Station reported 24 Apr 2003 that a suspected SARS

A 34 year old Indian man has been diagnosed with the SARS virus, a health
official said on Sunday, making him the country's seventh case of the
disease that has killed about 290 people worldwide.
The man, who visited Hong Kong this month, had arrived in India's financial
hub, Bombay, and was admitted to hospital last week after he developed a
fever, the official said. "He was discharged in Bombay as the fever went
away and he had no other symptoms," the official told Reuters. "But later,
his lab samples tested positive and he was traced in New Delhi and was
admitted to hospital on Saturday night," he said.

[In the past 24 hours 16 new cases and 12 deaths were reported from Hong
Kong. In Singapore only one new case was reported, a physician who recently
died, with exposure felt to be in the health care setting.
The epidemiological analyses presented on the Health Canada website are
welcome, of interest, and present a fairly clear picture of the lines of
transmission in the Greater Toronto area. The investigations to date still
do not suggest transmission in the general community. The continued
transmission in the health care setting is of concern, and we look forward
to the results of the studies now under way. The discussion also mentions
collaboration with the Australia, Philippines, United States, Germany, and
Bulgaria, suggesting that cases of SARS identified in those countries have
given a history of travel to Toronto.
The continued reports from India of individuals testing positive for the
SARS virus and being classified as cases is disturbing. As mentioned in
prior postings, the current diagnosis of SARS is one of exclusion -- based
on clinical and epidemiologic criteria and NOT on laboratory findings. Many
unanswered questions about the currently available diagnostic tests remain:
their continued use will determine their relative value. If the SARS virus
has entered India, one of the world's most populous countries, there is
significant reason for concern. Information from official sources on these
newswire reports would be very much appreciated to clarify the situation in
India. - Mod.MPP]
