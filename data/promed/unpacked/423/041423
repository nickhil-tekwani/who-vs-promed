The Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, has shown no signs of abatement in Tirthahalli taluk with 2 persons testing positive for the infection here in the past one week. With this, the total number of persons tested positive Tirthahalli taluk in the past 2 months has raised to 7. A 47-year-old woman, who tested positive for KFD, also died during this period.

KFD is a tick-borne viral infection that spreads from monkeys to humans through tick bite. Its symptoms include high fever, pain in joints, bleeding in nose and gums. Kiran S.K., taluk health officer of Tirthahalli, told The Hindu that more have been reported from Bandya-Kukke Gram Panchayat limits this year [2018]. On [Tue Jan 9 2018], the blood sample of a person from Ghantejanagallu village tested positive for KFD while another positive case was reported from the same village on [Mon 15 Jan 2018]. The health of the patients tested positive for KFD is being closely monitored.

So far, 8 monkeys have died of KFD in the forests in Tirthahalli taluk this year [2018]. The vaccine for KFD has been administered to the residents of villages in the radius of 5 km [approx 3 mi] from where the death of monkeys has been reported. Vaccine against KFD has been administered to around 40 000 persons in Tirthahalli taluk in the year 2017-18. Meanwhile, the death of a monkey due to KFD in Sorab taluk has triggered the panic among the residents. Gayathri, Taluk Health Officer of Sorab has said that the death was reported in the forest on the outskirts of Kattinakere village in Heggodu Grama Panchayat limits on [Fri 22 Dec 2017].

The tests conducted on the blood samples and viscera of the monkey in the laboratory confirmed that it was infected with KFD. Following this, vaccine against KFD has been administered to 1200 persons. The death of 3 more monkeys was reported in Heggodu Gram Panchayat limits on [Tue 9 Jan 2018], but the report of the examination conducted on their blood samples in laboratory is yet to be received. So far, no positive case of KFD among humans is reported in Sorab taluk this year [2018], she said.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is endemic in several districts of southern Indian state of Karnataka. As per the media report above, at least 7 cases have been confirmed to be infected with KFD virus during last 2 months from this state. In addition, there are reports of KFD associated deaths in monkeys in the adjoining forest areas.

Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection among herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters. Localized outbreak of are KFD are commonly reported during the dry season from November through May and is directly related to the increased activity of nymphs of the ticks and preparedness plan using One Health approach should be developed and implemented prior to the high transmission season.

Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are affective interventions to prevent KFD. There is need for sustained efforts to create awareness to prevent KFD in the local population to avoid tick bites and ensuring availability of KFD vaccination facilities in the affected districts. - Mod.UBA
