RABIES,FOX - USA (NORTH CAROLINA)
==================================
Date: Sun, 2 Mar 1997
From: Dorothy Preslar <dpreslar@fas.org>

A rabid fox attacked and bit four persons near Morrisville, NC last week.
The victims were 2 adult males working in a car rental agency's parking lot
at Raleigh-Durham Airport, 1 adult male working in his yard and 1 female
child playing outside a home. All victims are receiving vaccine.
[I can provide some additional information since the site of the attack is
about 10 minutes from my house. There are several "satellite" parking lots
for
car agencies which border upon the airport and Ulmstead state park. The
attack took place at one of these "satellite" car parks. The rather large
state
park is congruent with parts of the Research Triangle Park, Morrisville,
Raleigh and Durham which tend to be building and people sparse, while tree
and "unimproved" land dense for an "urban" area (at least before hurricane
Fran hit last September 5- my birthday,no less).
While this semi-rural character is part of the charm of the area, it has
also provided for an occasional rabid raccoon to wander on people's back
porches. The fox first bit a worker at the car rental, then came back and
bit another worker at the same location. A couple of hours later and
within a mile or so, a fox bit scratched a man working in his yard. A hour
later and few houses away the fox attacked a 7 year girl, biting her leg
(why don't people stay inside when a rabid animal is on the loose in the
vicinity? We have a great deal of public health education to do for this
epidemic). A fox was found dead the next day and tested positive at the
public health laboratory. There is no way to be sure that the dead fox was
the one that attacked the four people but the unprovoked attacks were
sufficient grounds for Lee Hunter, North Carolina's public health
veterinarian to recommend that the people undergo the $1500.00 post
exposure prophylaxis.
North Carolina, like many other places on the East Coast of the U.S. has
had increasing problems as of late. In 1990, there were 9 laboratory
confirmed cases of rabies. In 1994 - 1996, there were 175, 467 and 741 lab
confirmed cases respectively. No one would be surprised if we topped 1500
cases in 1997. In 1996, 581 cases were raccoon, 50 foxes, 47 skunk and 29
cats (although cat vaccination programs have had increased emphasis lately
and hope that the number will be reduced in future years. This is
important because an increasing number of cat rabies could have a greater
human impact than increased wildlife rabies per se). In 1996, bats (12)
and dog (10) were lab confirmed. There were three cases in horses, 1 case
in cows and 1 in a rabbit, diagnosed by a practicing veterinarian in
Charlotte, N.C.
One final comment. This is a classic case of a disconnect between the
discounting of epidemiologic facts as the epidemic occurs, funding of
public health activities and poor results in the control of an epidemic.
As would probably happen elsewhere, North Carolina has been slow to respond
to the epidemic. They are only talking now going to add an additional
public health veterinarian. The state lab is so overloaded that they
actually discourage the submission of samples and the public health
educational campaign has not really taken focus as of yet. It is hard to
understand the reasoning of those funding the public health activities. Do
they look at the statistic in various wildlife species and think that the
epidemic is going to go away by itself? - Mod. pc.]
