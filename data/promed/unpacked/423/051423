On 7 Jun 2005 the Mongolian Emergency Bureau announced that in 2 counties in
the Mongolian province of Gobi more than 400 sheep have died since the
beginning of the month [June 2005] from an as-yet-undiagnosed disease. These
areas have already started to take protective measures.
New China.net reported that the Mongolian Emergency Bureau spokesperson said
that since the beginning of the month in the 2 counties, sheep in a number of
household flocks had developed fever, lost their appetites, and progressively
declined until after some 23 days [sic] one after another died. At present
more than 20 flocks of sheep have been detected with this condition, but the
cause is still unknown.
The bureau spokesperson said that the bureau has sent out a work team to carry
out an investigation. To date they have confirmed that it is not anthrax. It
is estimated that it will take several more days to determine the cause or
causes of this problem. The proper authorities have declared martial law and
strict quarantine in the affected areas, stopping all movement of livestock,
people, and vehicles, with the objective of limiting disease spread. The work
team is examining the dead animals and inspecting other domestic livestock,
taking whatever protective measures they can.
Mongolia is a large country that depends on livestock for its prosperity and
retains a traditional and seasonal migratory pattern of grazing. Mongolia at
present has some 28 million head of domestic livestock, with the majority
being sheep and goats.

[The text of this newswire provides very little information on the disease
situation regarding the affected sheep. It seems that the disease has been
recorded in about 20 flocks; that it is manifested by fever and loss of
appetite, leading to death, which night take place up to 3 weeks after the
onset of symptoms; and that it seems not to affect humans. Anthrax (which a
priori does not have to be a candidate -- according to the described symptoms)
has been ruled out. There are several infectious sheep diseases which might be
taken into consideration, but in the absence of further details it would be
premature and pretentious to mention them now.
Mongolia's last available annual report on OIE's web-site, for 2003, can be
seen at
<http://www.oie.int/hs2/zi_pays.asp?c_pays=126>. A more descriptive text
report is not available.
The Mongolian veterinary services are known for their effectiveness (e.g., the
eradication of rinderpest, 1992) and transparency; let us wish them early
success in reaching a diagnosis. Details will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]

[Until Ulan Bator releases a more detailed report, this is all we have.
Because of the recognised competence of the Mongolian veterinary service, one
must be cautious in jumping in with a suggestion of parasitism. This report is
being copied to our contacts in Mongolia in hope of further information. -

[The diseases that killed the most sheep (shown as "ovi" for ovines in the
tables) in Mongolia in 2003 -- see URL above -- were: Hemorrhagic septicemia,
Salmonellosis (_S. abortusovis_) & Enterotoxemia. - Mod.JW]
