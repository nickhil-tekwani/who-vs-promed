Legionellosis in Spain - Update 1
---------------------------------
As of 18 Jul 2001, the National Centre for Epidemiology, Spain, has reported a
total of 751 cases of suspected legionellosis in Murcia (see previous
report). Three-hundred-ten of these cases have been laboratory confirmed.
The first case was hospitalized on 1 Jul 2001. Two deaths (one confirmed case
and one suspected case) have been reported. No cases have been reported
among tourists.
Since 7 Jul 2001, incidence has declined rapidly and there have been no new
cases reported since 14 Jul 2001. The epidemiological investigation and
surveillance are continuing. The most likely source of the outbreak is a
cooling tower in the city centre. The cooling tower has now been
disinfected.
