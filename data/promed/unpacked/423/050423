Marsabit County residents have been warned against use of animal products following a ban on slaughter of animals in Wajir County due to a Rift Valley fever outbreak.

Speaking during a crisis meeting on Thursday [14 Jun 2018], county director for public health Adano Kochi said that one out of 2 samples that had been sent to Kemri [Kenya Medical Research Institute] came back positive for RVF.

Mr Kochi said a 15-year-old boy who lost his life was not suffering from RVF as per the laboratory results from Kemri.

"We have one patient at Marsabit Referral Hospital who has been undergoing treatment for kala-azar, and according to the results, she is also suffering from RVF," said Mr Kochi.

According to a report from the team that has been conducting surveillance, small stock from neighbouring Wajir and Mandera counties are all heading to Moyale market to cash [in] on the festive season.

The county director for veterinary services, Boku Bodha, said animals, especially small stock, are being ferried from both Wajir and Mandera to Moyale market. He said that the situation is putting Marsabit County residents at risk.

"Mass slaughter of livestock during the Idd celebration is likely to pose a greater risk to the people. Luckily, RVF does not affect poultry, so our people can use chicken as a substitute," said Mr Bodha.

Livestock are mainly from areas bordering Badanrero, Bute, Buna, Basir, Lakole, Rahmu, Daandu, Qofole and wider Wajir and Mandera counties.

Mr Bodha said that in the past 3 weeks, the county has experienced increased cases of abortion in both camels and small stock as well as increased vector populations.

He added that 5 camels were found dead in Funanyatta while a farmer in Bori lost 5 of his 12 camels that aborted.

"Abortion in livestock, haemorrhage and fever characterise RVF in animals. We have received reports of increased cases in other areas like Badanrero, Amballo, Ittir, Kargi, Olturot, Loglogo, Korr and Laisamis," said Mr Bodhi. North Horr, Balesa, Demo, Shuur and Maikona are also affected.

Following the crisis, the veterinary department plans to enhance surveillance, institute ring vaccination to control disease spread, increase public awareness, institute quarantine of livestock, restrict home slaughter, and close livestock markets.

"Due to stagnant waters around homesteads and night enclosures, there is marked increase in population of mosquitoes and other biting flies, which have been a menace to livestock in the county," said Mr Bodha.

The Wajir Health department has arrested 5 people for violating a ban on sale of livestock products to control the spread of Rift Valley fever.

Health executive Abdihakim Billow said 6 people have died from the disease. The latest victim succumbed yesterday [14 Jun 2018] at Wajir County Referral Hospital. The woman from Basir in Eldas subcounty was among the 1st patients admitted to the hospital. The number of those infected is now 19.

Billow said the 5 will be charged with violating the ban.

The ban is being enforced by a joint team of public health officials, veterinary staff, and police.

Speaking to the press in Wajir town, Billow said new cases have been reported in Dasheg, Rabaqerany and in Diif, Wajir South. Most victims are admitted to Wajir County Referral Hospital and Eldas Subcounty Hospital.

Wajir county hospital CEO Ahmed Abdinur said nurses and doctors have been working round the clock to treat patients diagnosed with the disease.

He said his worry is the outbreak might get out of control. "We are doing everything humanly possible to save the lives of the victims. As you know, it is highly contagious, and it requires a high level of handling. It is our hope and prayer that the number of victims will not increase," Abdinur said.

On Wednesday [13 Jun 2018], the government asked Kenyans to avoid eating uninspected meat. Director of Medical Services Jackson Kioko and Veterinary Services director Obadiah Njagi called for immediate reporting of sudden deaths and abortions in livestock.

[3] Human death toll

The death toll from Rift Valley Fever in Wajir has risen to 6 after one more person died while receiving treatment. At least 10 cases have been confirmed within the area.

The 1st case was reported on 4 Jun [2018] after 2 relatives were referred to a local hospital with high fever and bleeding from the mouth.

One of the patients died the same day of their admission, a situation that has seen the government create a task force in order to reduce new incidences and prevent more deaths. The team comprises members from both the national and county government.

Obadiah Njagi, director of veterinary services, warned locals against handling meat that has not been inspected.

"To aid in early detection and response in the event of an outbreak, all reports of sudden deaths and abortions of livestock should be reported to the nearest veterinary office or any other office," Njagi said in a statement on Wednesday [13 Jun 2018].

He added: "It is highly advised that all persons who experience fever of unknown origin should also report to the nearest health facility immediately."

Rift Valley fever is a viral disease that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans.

The disease results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock, especially among camels and goats.

Some of the symptoms [in humans] associated with the fever are high fever, bleeding gums, body weakness, among others.

On 13 Jun [2018], the government banned the consumption of meat that had not been inspected. Locals objected to the ban on grounds that they depend on their livestock to feed their family.

According to WHO, the current outbreak has ecological and sub-regional geographical connotations. Livestock population movements are high in the sub-region, including cattle raiding activity between Uganda-Kenya-South Sudan.

"The ongoing heavy rains and flooding in Kenya and other countries in East Africa have also resulted in increased vector density. These factors could contribute to further spread of the disease in the sub-region."

One more person has died of suspected Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Wajir, bringing death toll to 6 as panic grips the county.

The victim, who was receiving treatment at the Wajir Referral Hospital, succumbed to the disease on Tuesday night [12 Jun 2018].

Dr Adam Hassan, deputy head in charge of preventive and promotive health care services, said 19 cases have been reported since the outbreak. Basir area in Eldas is worst hit with 17 cases reported from the area.

Mr Hassan said that a majority of the cases have reported contact with meat, and most of them involved individuals who slaughtered and distributed meat.

He added that they have set up 4 isolation centres in Wajir Referral Hospital, Basir, Arbajahan, and Eldas health centres in an effort to control the spread of the disease.

According to Harry Kimtai, Principal Secretary Livestock, the 200 000 doses [of vaccine for animals] will help curb the spread of the disease that has so far claimed the lives of 5 people in Wajir county.

Although no case of RVF has been reported in Tana River, Mandera, and Garissa counties, a team of livestock experts from the ministry have also been sent to the ground to help in the vaccination exercise.

Mr Kimtai said the ministry has already sent an alert to 20 counties; Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Nakuru, Laikipia, Kajiado, Baringo, Wajir, Garissa, Marsabit, Meru, Machakos, Taita Taveta, Tana River, Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Nyeri, Tharaka Nithi, Murang'a, and Kiambu to immediately commence animal vaccination and vector control.

"We are asking all the county governments to start animal vaccination and cooperate with our team so that we can contain the spread of this disease," he said.

However, an enhanced surveillance system has identified 4 counties as potential hotspots. These are, Marsabit, Wajir, Kajiado and Kitui.

The PS noted that already the director of veterinary services has informed the county directors and offered technical advice on disease detection and response.

At the same time, the directorate has set up an RVF alert centre using a toll-free line 0800 721 433 for immediate disease notification and response.

Mr Kimtai said a joint multiagency RVF outbreak technical committee comprising public health and animal health experts has been set up to assess the risk situation and advise the government on mitigation measures.

To contain the spread of the disease in Wajir, he said that, already, medical supplies including laboratory equipment and personal protective equipment have been supplied to departments of human and animal health technical support.

Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis, which periodically causes disease outbreaks in humans and livestock and is known to have been endemic in sub-Saharan Africa since 1912.

People with RVF have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. Patients usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, and dizziness at the onset of the illness, and weight loss.

In animals, sheep and cattle may have nasal discharge, excess salivation, and loss of appetite, weakness, or diarrhoea.

[This Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak has both human and animal health consequences and reducing risk to both requires a One Health approach. The loss of camels and small ruminants has social and economic consequences for their owners. Where access to banks is limited, these animals become a store of value as well as a critical source of family income.

The Kenya ministries of health and agriculture issued an alert for the risk of Rift Valley fever due to heavy rains and flooding and named 15 counties as high-risk areas (see Rift valley fever - Kenya: alert, prevention 20180531.5830703). The director of veterinary services, Obadiah Njagi, said that there was increased risk of RVF due to increased cases of flooding. He noted that flooding not only caused displacement of people and animals but also increased the risk of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as RVF, a viral disease of livestock, which also affects human beings if they get into contact with blood or tissues from infected animals. As Mods. AS and CRD noted in the previous ProMED-mail post, outbreaks of RVF are closely associated with periods of heavy rains and prolonged flooding, as with those driven by the warm phase of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon, increasing habitat suitability for vector populations. In East Africa, RVF epidemics take place periodically every 10-15 years; the last major outbreak occurred in 2006-2007. RVF is more likely to affect small ruminants and cattle. Rainfall facilitates mosquito eggs to hatch. _Aedes_ mosquitoes acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals and may potentially vertically transmit the virus to their eggs so that new generations of infected mosquitoes may hatch from their eggs. This provides a potential mechanism for maintaining the virus in nature, as the eggs of these mosquitoes may survive for periods of up to several years in dry conditions. Once livestock is infected, a wide variety of mosquito species may act as the vector for transmission of RVFV and can spread the disease.

These moderator comments also provide some key references. Parts of their information and much more on RVF, its epidemiology, diagnosis, and prevention are available in Chapter 2.1.18 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Manual, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.18_RVF.pdf.
