Confirmed: 3 cows in Livno died from anthrax
--------------------------------------------
The number of cows infected with anthrax in the
area of Livno has increased to 3 out of 10 dead
animals, for which the analysis at the Veterinary
Faculty in Sarajevo, confirmed the official sources.

Head of the Bacteriological Laboratory of
Veterinary Medicine Dr. Maid Rifatbegovic
confirmed that blood analysis demonstrated an
anthrax infection. This does not exclude the
possibility that other dead animals had anthrax
because they were on the same pasture.

Dr. Rifatbegovic, however, said he has no reason
to panic, stressing that it is appropriate curable disease in humans.

By order of the county government veterinary
inspectors stepped up surveillance in
Hercegbosanskoj County [also known as West
Bosnia]. Citizens are obliged to inform the
competent veterinary services of the death of
each animal so that a veterinarian can take blood
samples. In addition, authorities have ordered
the burning of dead animals and disposal of prescribed sanitary landfills.

[The Google translation was not absolutely clear
but is seems that 10 animals were found dead in
the same field, and the blood samples from 3 were
found to contain _B. anthracis_ organisms. We
have one prior ProMED report of anthrax in
Bosnia: Anthrax, cattle - Bosnia & Herzegovina (Bileca) 20010731.1496

According to the EU PH Statistics up to 2006 it
is sporadic in humans in that country but with
the opportunity for meaningful numbers:
<http://ec.europa.eu/health/ph_information/dissemination/echi/docs/anthrax_en.pdf>
Human cases over the years: 1997 (2), 1998 (1),
1999 (2), 2000 (0), 2001 (3), 2002 (3), 2003-2006
(0). So we can assume that this Livno outbreak is
not out of the ordinary expectations. - Mod.MHJ]
