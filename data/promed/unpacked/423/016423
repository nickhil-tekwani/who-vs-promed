Basler C, Forshey TM, Machesky K, Erdman CM, Gomez TM, Nguyen TA, Behravesh CB: Notes from the field: Multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella_ infections linked to live poultry from a mail-order hatchery in Ohio -- March-September 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In early 2013, 4 clusters of human salmonellosis infections were identified through PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne bacteria. Many of the ill persons in these clusters reported contact with live poultry, primarily chicks and ducklings, from a single mail-order hatchery; therefore, these investigations were merged. During 4 Mar 2013-9 Oct 2013, a total of 158 persons infected with outbreak strains of _Salmonella [enterica_] serotypes Infantis, Lille, Newport, and Mbandaka were reported from 30 states.

42 percent (65 of 155) of ill persons were aged 10 years or less, and 28 percent (29 of 103) were hospitalized; no deaths were reported. 86 percent (80 of 93) of ill persons who were interviewed reported live poultry contact in the week before illness onset. 69 percent (44 of 64) of ill persons who completed a supplemental live poultry questionnaire reported chick exposure, and 40 percent (26 of 64) reported duckling exposure. 75 percent (33 of 44) of respondents reported live poultry exposure at their home; 59 percent (26 of 44) specifically reported keeping poultry inside their home.

Of the 40 ill persons who had recently purchased young poultry, the average time from purchase of poultry to illness onset was 21 days (range=2-52 days); 48 percent (19 of 40) ill persons reported illness onset within 2 weeks of poultry purchase. Among persons with purchase information, 94 percent (62 of 66) reported buying young poultry sourced from a single mail-order hatchery in Ohio.

This outbreak investigation identified an Ohio hatchery as the likely source of the outbreak. This hatchery previously has been linked with multiple, large human salmonellosis outbreaks (1,2). These recurring outbreaks highlight the need for comprehensive salmonellosis prevention and control programs to be implemented and maintained at this mail-order hatchery and its associated breeder farms. Mail-order hatcheries and their source flocks should comply with management and sanitation practices outlined by the US Department of Agriculture's National Poultry Improvement Plan.* Additional owner education is necessary because healthy birds can still transmit the bacterium to humans. Educational material warning customers and advising them on how to reduce the risk for salmonellosis from live poultry should be distributed by farm/feed stores and mail-order hatcheries with all live poultry purchases (3). Reducing the spread of salmonellae in mail-order hatcheries, in their source flocks, and in the feed store environment is critical to reduce the risk for human illness. This outbreak highlights the need for a comprehensive approach involving human and animal health officials and practitioners, industry, and backyard poultry flock owners.

[_Salmonella_ carried in the intestines of chicks and ducklings contaminates their environment and the entire surface of the animal. Children can be exposed to the bacteria by simply holding, cuddling, or kissing the birds. _Salmonella_ can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Some people are more susceptible to infection and will have more severe disease. These people include young children, pregnant women, the elderly, people on chemotherapy, diabetics, and others with weakened immune systems. - Mod.LL
