Background Information on Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome in Canada
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The first documented case of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Canada
occurred in Alberta in 1989.
7 species of hantavirus have been identified in Canada: _Prospect Hill
virus_, *Bloodland lake virus, _Topografov virus_, _Sin Nombre virus_, _New
York virus_, _El Moro canyon virus_ and **Blue river virus [see Mod.
comment below]. Of these, only _Sin Nombre virus_ and _New York virus_ are
known to be pathogenic to man.
As of December 1999, 32 cases (12 fatal = 38 percent) had been reported --
all from western Canada: 20 from Alberta, 6 from British Columbia, 5 from
Saskatchewan, and one from Manitoba. The average age of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome cases has been 39 years (range: 15 to 62 years). The
majority of cases (19/32, 60 percent) have been male.
Cases have occurred in every month but March, with an apparent bimodal
seasonal distribution (spring and late fall). 50 percent of the cases
(16/32) occurred during the months of April, May, and June. Most cases
appear to follow exposure to _Sin Nombre virus_ in rodent excreta in rural
areas.
One case was reported in 1989; 1 in 1990; 8 in 1994; 3 in 1995; 3 in 1996;
7 in 1997; 6 in 1998; 2 in 1999; 1 (Manitoba) in 2000. (The disease became
officially-reportable as of 1 Jan 2000). 3 cases were reported in 2001 (2
Alberta and 1 Saskatchewan). 8 cases were reported from Alberta during
1994 to 1996 -- all having been exposed to rodents, including deer mice
(_Peromyscus maniculatus_).
The principal reservoir of Sin Nombre virus is the deer mouse (_Peromyscus
maniculatus_); and that of New York virus is the white-footed mouse
(_Peromyscus leucopus_). [Hanatavirus infected] deer mice are found in
every province except Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia. Deer mice
infected with viral strains closely related to **Monongahela virus and _New
York virus_ have been found in eastern Canada (Newfoundland, New Brunswick,
Quebec and Ontario). Mice infected with strains related to _Sin Nombre
virus_ and **Convict Creek virus have been found west of Ontario.
Sero-positive deer mice are found in 30.8 percent of the area of Manitoba.

[In the 7th Report of the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy
(published as Virus Taxonomy, Edited by M.V.H.van Regenmortel et al.,
Academic Press, 2000) _Prospect Hill virus_, _Topografov virus_, _Sin
Nombre virus_, _New York virus_, and _El Moro canyon virus_ are listed as
recognized species of the genus _Hantavirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_,
and therefore the names are rendered in italics. *Bloodland lake virus is
listed as a tentative species and hence is not accorded an italicised name.
**The remaining 3 viruses, Blue river virus, Monongahela virus, and Convict
Creek virus, are similar to Sin Nombre virus and not regarded as separate
species, and likewise are not given italicised names. - Mod.CP]
