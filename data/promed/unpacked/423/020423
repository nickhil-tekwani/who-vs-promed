The National Institute for Farming Research (INIA, according to its Spanish
initials) reports the results of avian samples from Miranda State,
specifically from Las Salias municipality. Newcastle virus was found in 5
heavy hens, and pathogenicity studies are pending.
INIA also reports one case (a hen) from Altagracia community in Guaicaipuro
municipality, from which Newcastle virus was isolated. Also, some samples
from Miranda, Cojedes, and Falcon states have been received, and their
results are pending.
Samples were received from 34 breeding chickens Libertador municipality in
Carabobo state. These samples were reported as negative for Group D
_Salmonella_ micro test.

The National Institute for Farming Research (INIA, according to its Spanish
initials) reported avian samples from the following states: Bolivar, la
Gran Sabana municipality (one chicken and one hen): Newcastle disease,
Velogenic path type I for intracerebral pathogenicity (IPIC) 1.66; Guarico,
Miranda municipality (adult bird) and Miranda, Guaicaipuro municipality (3
heavy hens), high-pathogenicity Newcastle virus was isolated, and brain
pathogenicity index is pending for both cases.
In Falcon state, Carirubana municipality (Flamingo), neither Newcastle
virus nor avian influenza virus was isolated. In Aragua state, Marino
municipality (10 baby chickens tested), no salmonella was isolated.
Results are pending for all these cases in the following states: Falcon,
Miranda municipality (heavy hens 2-3 years old), Aragua, Zamora
municipality (4 heavy hens); Carabobo, Naguanagua municipality (internal
organs from a single hen), Valencia municipality (internal organs from some
heavy hens and 3 serum specimens), Libertador municipality (4 breeding
chickens), and Los Guayos municipality (adults birds: tracheal and cloacal
swabs, as well as blood serum); Monagas, Maturin municipality (internal

[It appears that Venezuela has confirmed the arrival of Newcastle disease
virus and is trying to determine the extent of the spread and its
pathogenicity.
Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is a paramyxovirus that is contagious and
fatal. So much so, that many birds die without showing any clinical signs
and in some outbreaks mortality has reached almost 100 per cent in
unvaccinated flocks. NDV may even cause mortality in vaccinated flocks.
The disease is transmitted through infected birds' droppings and secretions
from the nose, mouth, and eyes. NDV spreads rapidly among birds kept in
confinement, such as commercially raised chickens and spread primarily
through the bodily discharges of infected birds.
Clinical signs include sneezing; gasping for air; nasal discharge;
coughing; greenish, watery diarrhea; nervousness; depression; muscular
tremors; drooping wings; twisting of head and neck; circling; complete
paralysis; decrease or cessation of egg production and thin-shelled eggs;
swelling of the tissues around the eyes and in the neck; and sudden death.
There is no known treatment for the highly pathogenic form of Newcastle
disease virus, sometimes called exotic Newcastle disease or END.
Diagnosis is often by swabs from the cloaca or trachea using ELISA or PCR.
