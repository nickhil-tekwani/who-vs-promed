The above presentation (18 slides) of the Bulgarian delegate during
the SCFCAH meeting of 2 May 2011 in Brussels included a map (slide 12)
showing 3 locations in Turkish Thrace where wild boar are claimed to
have been found seropositive for FMD in 2010. They are marked in 3 out
of the 8 districts in the Turkish province Kirklareli, namely the
districts Demirkoy, Kirklareli and Pinarhisar.
