TB travelled from a farm to a night club
----------------------------------------
Six people who spent a night clubbing near Birmingham, in the English
Midlands, in late 2004 have contracted bovine tuberculosis (TB). One man
has been identified as the source of the outbreak, and one woman who was
infected has died. This is the 1st time in decades that human-to-human
transmission of bovine TB has been documented in the United Kingdom and
coincides with a steady increase in the rate of infection in cattle. Nearly
one per cent of the British herd is now thought to carry the disease.
In the 1930s, around 40 per cent of cattle in the UK were infected with TB,
and around 2000 people a year died from the disease, mostly as a result of
drinking unpasteurized milk or coming into close contact with the animals.
Pasteurization and the introduction of routine TB testing in cattle brought
this under control but, in recent years, bovine TB has been on the rise, a
trend that some farmers blame on badgers spreading the infection.
Peter Hawkey of the University of Birmingham, who presented findings on the
human outbreak last week at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial
Agents and Chemotherapy in San Francisco, says that all the evidence
suggests it was an isolated incident. "The increase of infections in cattle
may increase the opportunity for human infection, but nothing has changed
about virulence or transmission from cattle," he says.
Hawkey says the outbreak was caused by a confluence of rare circumstances
and should therefore not cause undue alarm. Some of the people affected had
underlying medical conditions such as being HIV positive, or were using
anabolic steroids, both of which would make them more susceptible to
infection. The average age of the people affected by the outbreak was 32,
whereas those who catch the disease from cattle are usually much older.
"This is the 1st recognized human-to-human transmission of bovine
tuberculosis since the recent resurgence in cattle," says David Hunt, an
epidemiologist for the UK's Health Protection Agency. He says new
technology has made it easier to compare samples from different people and
that may be why human-to-human transmission has been identified now. "After
an extensive investigation, we have found nothing for the public at large
to be worried about," he says.
But Francis Jamieson of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care
in Canada says that, while outbreaks such as this are unusual, they still
constitute an important public health issue, and diligent monitoring of all
types of tuberculosis is necessary to minimize any threat.
To that end, Hawkey is building a database of all known strains of
tuberculosis so that, whenever an outbreak strikes, he can pinpoint the
strain immediately.

[Exchange of mycobacteria infections between humans and cattle is not that
unusual, though not common now. Dairy cows are reported [to have been]
infected with _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from infected dairymen,
especially those [who are ] HIV positive. In rural Brazil some one per cent
of human TB cases are of _M. bovis_. I am a skin-test positive for TB,
probably as a result of the raw milk that was delivered to our house each
morning from one of the dairy farms in the village in the late 1930s; at
that time, 36 per cent of UK dairy herds contained reactors. My Godfather,
Ted Robinson, had a spinal bovis infection, as a result of which he lost
his toes but, using his connections, he wangled his way into the Royal Air
Force during the [second world] war and was in airphoto intelligence, which
made up for not being able to fight in Spain. But these recent cases in
Birmingham point up the need for the UK to actively eradicate this bovine
disease. - Mod.MHJ
Human infection from bovine tuberculosis caused by _M. bovis_ has been
mostly, but not completely, eradicated in the developed world by the use of
pasteurization of milk and culling of herds shown positive on skin testing,
starting in about 1917. In the USA, it continues to be reported, primarily
in immigrants, although it generally accounts for less than one per cent of
all mycobacterial isolates.
The organism is part of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex, along with the
tubercle bacillus, the BCG bacillus, and _M. africanum_. _M. bovis_ can be
distinguished from _M. tuberculosis_ by specific gene probes (the standard
probe just identifies the _M. tuberculosis_ complex), specific biochemical
reactions, and routine resistance to pyrazinamide. Although called bovine
tuberculosis, the bacillus has a broad host range, including cattle, pigs,
goats, cats, dogs, badgers, foxes, marsupials, rabbits, sheep, horses, and
deer. - Mod.LL]
