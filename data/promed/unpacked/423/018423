China: Suspected Case of Japanese Encephalitis in Hong Kong S.A.R.
---------------------------------------------------
The Hong Kong Center for Health Protection is monitoring a suspected case
of Japanese encephalitis involving a 45-year-old man living in Yuen Long,
Hong Kong. The center is performing lab tests to confirm the diagnosis. As
a precautionary measure, Hong Kong's Food Environmental Hygiene Department
has carried out vector surveys and mosquito control measures near the
patient's residence.
The man, a local resident, developed fever, headache, and drowsiness on Tue
8 Jun 2004. He was admitted to North District Hospital and later
transferred to Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, where he is in
critical condition. The patient did not travel outside Hong Kong in the
past 3 months. The Center's medical staff visited the patient's 4 household
contacts and put them under medical surveillance. They did not have any
symptoms of the illness. Results of the laboratory tests are expected
within a day. Relevant departments are taking action in the event this case
is confirmed.
7 cases have been reported in Hong Kong since 1992, and one Indonesian
woman died of the disease earlier in June 2004 [see ProMED-mail post
archived as "Japanese encephalitis, fatal - China (Hong Kong)
20040611.1573"]. Japanese encephalitis is transmitted by culicine
mosquitoes living mainly in rural areas, and Hong Kong has been launching a
citywide anti-mosquito campaign in an effort to prevent the
mosquito-related diseases.

[As of 14 Jun 2004, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the
Department of Health was still investigating the Japanese encephalitis (JE)
case involving a 29-year-old Indonesian woman who died on 7 Jun 2004
(<http://www.info.gov.hk/dh/new/index.htm>). The staff of CHP has contacted
269 households in the area of Kau Wa Keng San Tsuen, and over 500 persons
were interviewed with a questionnaire survey. None of them reported having
neurological symptoms of JE. A CHP spokesman said so far 115 blood samples
from local residents were collected for serological tests to ascertain JE
exposure. Serology tests on blood samples of the 7 house contacts of the
Indonesian woman yielded negative results for JE. Laboratory work on blood
samples of the remaining 115 residents is ongoing. The Food and
Environmental Hygiene Department is continuing with a vector survey
covering 2 kilometers around the woman's residence. District pest control
officers are enhancing mosquito control efforts with weekly fogging and
larviciding for elimination of mosquito breeding sites. As of 14 Jun 2004
no new case has been discovered, and the departments concerned have taken
comprehensive measures to reduce the risk of JE in the area.
From 1992 to 2003, there have been 6 sporadic cases of JE reported in Hong
Kong, including one local case in 1996, one imported case in 1997, one
imported case in 2001, 2 imported cases in 2002, and one local case in
2003. The case described in the above report has never traveled beyond the
boundaries of Hong Kong and appears to be a local (sporadic) case. The 2
cases reported so far in 2004 originate from different geographic areas
within Hong Kong -- the 1st case (now also considered to be a local case)
was in the Kwai Chung area in the New Territories section closer to
Kowloon, and this 2nd case is in Yuen Long, in the New Territories
section. Both areas are on the mainland, but the 2nd case closer to the
mainland border with China.
