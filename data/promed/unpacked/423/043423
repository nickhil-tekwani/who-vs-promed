2nd Person May Have Contracted Variant CJD via Blood Transfusion
---------------------------------------------------
A 2nd possible case of a patient contracting variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease [abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail] through a
blood transfusion has been confirmed, the Department of Health (DOH) said
today. The patient received a blood transfusion in 1999 from a donor who
later went on to develop vCJD -- the human form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) or "mad cow disease".
The DoH said the patient died of causes unrelated to vCJD, but a
post-mortem revealed the presence of the vCJD agent in the spleen,
according to the National CJD Surveillance Unit. The development followed
the 1st reported case of a patient contracting vCJD from a blood
transfusion which was announced by Health Secretary John Reid in December
2003. The patient, who received donor blood during an operation in 1997,
developed vCJD and died 6 years later.
In response to that case -- thought to be the 1st person-to-person
transmission of vCJD in the world -- the Government banned anyone who had
received a blood transfusion since January 1980 from donating blood in the
future. The DoH said today that it was now extending measures to cover a
larger group of transfusion recipients who will no longer be allowed to
give blood from 2 Aug 2004.
Dr Reid said today, "We are continuing to follow a highly precautionary
approach. Although people may have concerns about the implications of this
announcement, I would emphasise again that the exclusion criteria are being
tightened because of a small but unquantifiable risk. People should
continue to have a blood transfusion when it is really necessary. Any
slight risk associated with receiving blood must be balanced against the
significant risk of not receiving that blood when it is most needed."
