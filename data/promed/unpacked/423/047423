The antigenic characterization of the AIV found in a dead mallard in
Eskilstuna on 21 Oct 2005 has been completed at the National Veterinary
Institute.

The virus was grown in embryonated eggs and identified as H5 with a panel
of antisera confirming the preliminary results obtained by PCR. The
neuraminidase subtype was found to be N3 as determined by the neuraminidase
inhibition (NI) test.

[Drs Klingeborn and Czifra are gratefully acknowledged for their 1st-hand
notification, describing the expediently completed isolation of
the influenza A H5N3 virus from the intestine of one (out of 4) dead
mallards forwarded for investigation on 22 Oct 2005, and providing its
final identity. It will be interesting to note whether pathological changes
and/or other laboratory tests incriminated or excluded the virus as the
cause of the mallard's death. Results of pathogenicity test in chickens, if
contemplated, will be helpful.
According to the revised International Terrestrial Animal Health Code, all
H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses are regarded as "notifiable avian
influenza" (NAI). If found highly pathogenic in poultry, they become HPNAI.
The results of tests being conducted on dead wild birds (reportedly wild
geese) found in Germany on 25 Oct 2005 and from poultry (reportedly turkey)
said to be suspected of avian influenza in Greece on 17 Oct 2005 are
pending. - Mod.AS]
