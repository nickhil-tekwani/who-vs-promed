SARS - WORLDWIDE (177): SEROSURVEY CHINA ANIMAL TRADERS

3 months into the SARS epidemic, I proposed 4 questions to the ProMED list:
"Why Asia? Why now? Why young adults? Why the panic?"  and suggested an
hypothesis. (Archive Number 20030405.0833).
The origin and nature of the outbreak bore many similarities to those of
influenza, suggesting the possibility of an Asian animal reservoir and the
existence of significant background immunity in the affected population.
This week's study in MMWR indicates that animal contact may indeed promote
infection; however, the most striking finding seems to have eluded the
authors: 1.2 percent to 2.9 percent of individuals in a healthy control
group of adults were also found to be seropositive!
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5241a2.htm>)
The population of Guangdong Province is 86.42 million (2001), of whom 61.14
million are adults over age 14. If we assume that the seropositivity rates
among controls is representative of the province as a whole, 734 000 to 1
773 000 adults in Guangdong have at some time been infected by the SARS
virus. These figures are 87- to 211-fold the total number (8422) of SARS
patients reported worldwide to date!
Unfortunately, the control groups examined in the present study consisted
of persons who might have been directly exposed to SARS patients: 1)
health-care workers involved with SARS control in 2 city hospitals, 2)
public health workers in the Guangdong CDC facility, and 3) healthy adults
visiting a clinic for routine physical examinations. Furthermore, the ELISA
assay utilized detects IgG antibody, and cannot determine the timing of
exposure to the virus. Hopefully, additional studies will examine humans
and animals from other regions. If documented, the existence of a
significant level of background seropositivity will have far-reaching
consequences. Although further attempts at case-finding and isolation will
prove futile, the fact that only a small percentage of persons acquiring
the virus develop significant disease will relegate SARS to the status of
"just another flu."

[Dr. Berger raises important issues that still await resolution. While the
results of this study are very interesting and seem to point to wild
animals as the possible origin species for the SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV), questions remain. The identification of 1.2 to 2.9 percent of
otherwise healthy controls with positive antibodies to the SARS-CoV is a
curious finding. Is it due to reduced specificity of the ELISA test used
for this study? Were these controls really healthy controls or did they
have a history of a serious or significant febrile respiratory illness in
recent years that may have been sporadic cases of illness associated with
the SARS-CoV? Or were they truly asymptomatic infections that occurred
during the outbreak in China earlier this year?
A review of the literature to date does not reveal a plethora of articles
addressing the sensitivity and specificity of the current serologic tests
used to identify antibodies against the SARS-CoV. In an article in the
Chinese medical literature (English abstract available on PubMed) (National
Research Project For SARS Beijing Group [Serum antibodies detection for
serological diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome] Zhonghua Jie He
He Hu Xi Za Zhi. 2003 Jun;26(6):339-42), they evaluated the significance of
serum specific antibodies against the SARS-CoV in the diagnosis of SARS.
Specific IgG antibodies for SARS virus in 267 serum specimens from patients
with SARS and 132 from non-SARS patients or healthy persons were assayed
with IFA or ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of measuring IgG on or
after the 11th day of illness was 91.1 percent and 97.0 percent,
respectively. Similar results could be seen when IgG was detected by
ELISA. Hence, the IgG positivity seen in "normal healthy controls" could
be false positive results.
During a review of the laboratory presentation at the first Global SARS
conference held in Malaysia in Jun 2003, the lack of standardization of
laboratory tests was identified as a significant issue. (available for
review at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/conference/june_2003/materials/presentations/en/laboratorydiagnosis.pdf>)
Dr. Berger asks whether there evidence of asymptomatic infection with the
SARS-CoV as seen with many other viral infections, or is this one of the
unusual viruses with a very low asymptomatic infection rate. If the former
is the case, a follow-on question is whether asymptomatically infected
individuals are significant for continued transmission of this virus. The
verdict is not in as yet. - Mod.MPP]
