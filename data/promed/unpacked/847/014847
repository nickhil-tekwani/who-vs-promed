SYPHILIS (4)
============
[With reference to false negatives possibly caused by drug
interference:]
A practice among the old timers in the army, in the days when the Kahn or
VDRL test and the Wasserman were the only serologies for syphilis, was to
get high on alcohol the day (or night) before they expected to be bled.
They assured me that this would result in a negative test; I never had the
opportunity to determine whether this was myth or fact.
