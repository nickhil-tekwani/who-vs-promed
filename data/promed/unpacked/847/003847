Epidemiological update: end of West Nile virus transmission season in
Europe
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Since the 21 Jun [2011], ECDC has published on its website weekly
updates on spatial distribution of West Nile fever cases in the
European Union and neighbouring countries. Cases reported in the EU
were confirmed cases according to the EU case definition and all
reported cases outside the EU. The web page with the weekly maps was
among the most visited pages during the period.

The 1st cases of West Nile fever were reported on 26 Jul [2011] from
Romania (Galati county, 1 case) and the Russian Federation (Volgograd
oblast, 3 cases).

As of 24 Nov 2011, 93 confirmed human cases of West Nile fever have
been reported in the EU; 69 cases in Greece, 14 in Italy, and 10 in
Romania. In the neighbouring countries, 189 cases have been declared:
2 in Albania, 4 in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 33 in
Israel, 136 in the Russian Federation, 3 in Tunisia, 3 in Turkey and 8
cases in Ukraine.

In the EU, Greece has been the most affected country with 69 cases. A
total of 11 areas reporting confirmed cases have been displayed on the
map.

Italy has reported 14 confirmed cases from 7 provinces, including 2
provinces in Sardegna, and in Romania 10 confirmed cases have been
notified from 5 counties.

In the neighbouring countries, most of the cases have been reported
from the Russian Federation. A total of 136 cases have been detected
in 7 oblasts. Cases have also been reported from Ukraine where 3
oblasts have been affected.

In Albania, 2 cases have been reported from one prefecture. In the
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, 4 cases have been reported from
one region. And in Turkey, 3 provinces have reported cases.

In other countries of the Mediterranean basin, Israel has reported 33
cases from 4 of the 6 districts in the country. Finally, Tunisia has
reported 3 cases in one province.

Since 27 Oct 2011, no new cases have been reported in the EU. The
number of cases reported outside the EU also decreased dramatically
and often referred to late reported cases. With the decrease of
mosquito populations, the season of West Nile virus transmission to
humans has now come to an end in Europe and neighbouring countries.
ECDC published its last weekly update of the WN fever maps on Fri 25
Nov 2011 and closed its seasonal monitoring of West Nile virus
transmission for 2011.

[This is a complete and interesting overview of clinical human West
Nile virus infections in the European Union. It would also be
interesting to have information about the number of equine cases in
the affected areas and the time and specific places of their
occurrence (some are listed below in 2011 ProMED-mail archived
reports).
