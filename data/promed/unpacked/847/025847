This are interesting diagnostic considerations which, indeed, should be
carried out. But in the actual case you may discard this alternative
anthology for one rather simple reason. The total picture of an infectious
epidemic is substantially different from a toxic endemic - in that it would
easily explain 60 - 70 dead gold miners among 20,000 who are - roughly -
healthy. If a toxic process and exposition were to assume, however, we
would see another epidemiological "embedding" of the severe cases:
possibly 1% dead people, 5% nearly dead, 10% really ill, 25% rather ill an
some 35% somehow symptomatic, the rest may be representing more or less
abortive stages of intoxication. That would be a typical picture of a
group's shared toxic exposition. But what we see around Durba/Watsa is a
rather typical picture of an infectious disease, let be with a low
contiguousness and many subclinical cases. Then there are, in fact,
positive filovirus cultures, which makes it likely that we are confronted
with new variants of the contagious agent rather than with a new form of
intoxication. It would seem unlikely that two "oreilleurs" could work under
the same conditions, one dying and the other one not even touched by a
shared toxic exposition - whilst this is quite normal for infections.
Remember also the Kitum cave, which was suspected earlier to be the source
of infection for several severe filovirus cases among tourists and the old
bat-rich factory, which has been found as starting point for two Ebola
epidemics in Central Africa. This makes caves and old mines very
interesting. Furthermore, the filovirus group seems to be highly variable,
showing us today already the different lines Ebola, Marburg, Reston (simian
and asymptomatic human). Kikwit, Gabon (human and simian) and Philippines
(simian). Why not a new, maybe less virulent "Durba variant"? Just wait for
the genetic decoding!
