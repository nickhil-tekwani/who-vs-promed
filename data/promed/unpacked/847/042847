CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE, INCREASED VIRULENCE - AUSTRALIA: (VICTORIA)

A total of 3 elderly patients at a Melbourne private hospital have
been diagnosed with a potentially fatal and highly infectious stomach
[intestinal] bug, sparking fears the strain is spreading in
Australia. The strain of _Clostridium difficile_ has killed thousands
of people in Europe and North America, but has never been detected in
Australia before.

Those 3 elderly patients at the Epworth Hospital in Richmond have
been infected with the bug, which causes severe diarrhoea, but they
have all recovered well. The executive medical director at the
Epworth, Dr Megan Robertson, says the strain could be more widespread
and hospitals need to be vigilant.

"This particular bug is not destroyed by alcohol so we have to clean
with bleach and detergent, but that's well identified with the common
strain," Dr Robertson said. "So those precautions and those spread
measures are no different with the hypervirulent strain, it's just
that we need to be more vigilant."

She says the strain may be going undetected in other hospitals.
"_Clostridium difficile_ infection is widespread in Australia; it's
the hypervirulent strain that has not been detected previously, but
it is not so widely tested for," she said.

[Presumably the news release above that concerns a new hypervirulent
strain of _Clostridium difficile_ is referring to the North American
pulsed-field type 1 (NAP1) or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]
ribotype 02 strain that has caused outbreaks of colitis with
increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality in
North America, Japan, and Europe. For a detailed discussion of _C.
difficile_ infection, please see a prior ProMED post Clostridium
difficile, ribotype 027 - UK: (N. Ireland) 20080207.0498.

A recent study has documented airborne dispersal of _C. difficile_
around patients with symptomatic _C. difficile_ infection during
periods of activity around the patient's bedside, which may explain
the widespread contamination of environmental surfaces with epidemic
strains (EL Best, et al. The Potential for Airborne Dispersal of
Clostridium difficile from Symptomatic Patients. Clin Infect Dis
2010; 50: 1450-1457). Health care workers who touch these
contaminated surfaces can spread the disease to susceptible patients
by direct contact.

These observations emphasizes the need for hand washing, appropriate
patient isolation procedures as soon as possible after onset of
diarrhea, and environmental decontamination after discharge of
symptomatic patients with _C. difficile_ infection. See also CJ.
Donskey. Editorial Commentary: Preventing Transmission of Clostridium
difficile: Is the Answer Blowing in the Wind? Clinical Infect Dis
2010; 50:11, 1458-1461.

Victoria is the 2nd most populous and most densely populated state in
Australia, with over 70 percent of its people living in Melbourne,
the state capital and largest city
