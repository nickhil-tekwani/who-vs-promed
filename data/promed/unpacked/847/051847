The Tippecanoe County Health Department is tracking an increase in the number of syphilis cases in the area. This year [2015], there have been 12 reports of syphilis in Tippecanoe County compared with fewer than 5 reports in each the of the previous 4 years, the health department said on Friday [30 Oct 2015].

Local and state health departments are partnering to "closely monitor this trend, educate the public and health care providers about syphilis, and help facilitate proper testing and treatment of affected individuals," according to a press release from the department.

Jeremy Adler, the county department's health officer, said anecdotal reports suggest those contracting the infection are engaged in risky sexual behavior with multiple partners. Adler said that smartphone apps such as Tinder that facilitate random sexual encounters, could be contributing to the issue. He noted the disease is spread through sexual contact and not through drug use, such as sharing needles. "Syphilis is often viewed as a disease that happened a long time ago that was a problem in the old days," Adler said. "But clearly, this shows that it still can be a big problem, and it's something that we have to really be aware of and educate the public about."

Statewide, Indiana is following the same trend. More than 350 cases of syphilis were reported between 10 Jan-3 Oct of this year [2015], representing a 53 per cent increase from last year, according to a press release from the Indiana State Department of Health. "This is an alarming increase in the number of people being diagnosed with a preventable and curable disease," state health commissioner Jerome Adams said in the release.

Most cases have occurred in men who have had sexual contact with other men, although some heterosexual cases have been reported, according to the state's information.

Syphilis is a sexually contracted infection and in certain stages can cause symptoms including sores, fever, muscle aches and weight loss.

State health officials are urging healthcare providers to educate patients about their risks of syphilis and to be aggressive about testing and treatment following a sharp increase in the number of infectious syphilis cases being reported across the state this year [2015].

Preliminary data show that 357 early syphilis cases, or those less than a year in duration, were reported between 10 Jan and 3 Oct of this year [2015], an increase of nearly 53 per cent over the 234 diagnosed during the same period in 2014. Most cases have occurred among men who have sex with men [MSM], but heterosexual cases are also being identified. The number of cases of congenital syphilis among pregnant women also has increased.

"This is an alarming increase in the number of people being diagnosed with a preventable and curable disease," said state health commissioner Jerome Adams: "We are working closely with local health officials, disease intervention specialists, and health care providers to ensure that people are educated about their risks and receive early testing and treatment so we can stop this disease in its tracks."

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that is spread by direct, skin to skin contact during unprotected sex. Pregnant women who are infected can transmit it to their unborn babies. In its primary stage, syphilis causes painless sores on the genitals. As the disease progresses to the secondary stage, it can cause rashes on the body, hands and feet, alopecia [hair loss], fever, muscle aches and weight loss. If left untreated, it could cause blindness, deafness or neurological complications. Untreated cases in pregnant women can result in miscarriage or stillbirth, preterm or low birth weight babies, bone deformities, deafness, seizures and other symptoms. Many people infected with syphilis do not notice the symptoms, which will resolve without treatment. Syphilis is most infectious in its primary and secondary stages, but anyone with untreated syphilis of less than one year's duration is considered able to transmit the infection.

Syphilis is diagnosed with a blood test and can be cured with appropriate antibiotics. Treating a pregnant woman also effectively treats her unborn baby. It is important that women receive treatment for syphilis at least 30 days prior to delivery to effectively treat the baby.

Healthcare providers should talk with their patients about any possible exposures to early syphilis, as well as known risk factors. Providers should recommend testing for syphilis, HIV and other STDs and offer preventive treatment to anyone exposed to a case of early syphilis to reduce the chance of infection and the spread of disease. All those diagnosed with infectious syphilis need immediate treatment.

Indiana law requires physicians to test all women for syphilis when they become pregnant and to retest those at high risk for infection in the last trimester. All cases of syphilis must be reported to the local STD district office within 72 hours of diagnosis under Indiana's Communicable Disease Reporting Rule.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that all patients who test positive for syphilis also be tested for HIV.

[Tippecanoe County, with a population of 172 780 in 2010, is a located in the north west quadrant of the US state of Indiana (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippecanoe_County,_Indiana). The county is best known for Purdue University in the town of West Lafayette; Purdue is a large public university, which is a member of the Big Ten Conference, the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University#Big_Ten_Committee_on_Institutional_Cooperation). The university has almost 30 000 undergraduate and over 9000 postgraduate students. A map of Indiana that shows the location of Tippecanoe County can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tippecanoe+County,+IN/@40.3883123,-89.1361521,7z/data.

Increases in the incidence of primary and secondary syphilis in the US and elsewhere have occurred primarily among men, and particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM). In the US in 2013, 75 per cent of primary and secondary syphilis cases occur in MSM. This has been attributed to a variety of reasons that promote unprotected sex, such as engaging in sex only with partners perceived to have the same HIV status as one's own in an attempt to avoid using condoms (serosorting), taking pre-exposure (PrEP) or post-exposure HIV prophylaxis, use of psychoactive "party drugs", multiple anonymous sex partners, use of smartphone apps, such as Grindr and Tinder, that facilitate anonymous "hookups", etc.

We are not told the details of the epidemiology of the current outbreak of infectious syphilis in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, but it would be important to know whether it is occurring among the Purdue population, whether it involves MSM, the frequency of HIV co-infection, or the use of smartphone apps that facilitate multiple anonymous sex partners. More information on the specific situation in Tippecanoe County from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

The 2nd news report above says that most cases in the state of Indiana have occurred among MSM, but heterosexual cases are also being identified, and congenital syphilis has also increased. This may be a spillover of the ongoing syphilis outbreak in MSM that could be attributable to MSM who also have unprotected sex with women.
