Abdul Moeloek General Hospital in Bandarlampung, Lampung has again
quarantined a patient suspected of being infected [with avian
influenza] after showing symptoms of high fever, coughing and
difficulties of breathing. The patient was reported to have had
direct contact with her chickens that had suddenly died. She burned
the dead chickens and buried them near her house a few days ago. Her
husband said thousands of chickens near his home had abruptly died in
the past 2 weeks. "The dead chickens included 15 of mine. All the
chickens in our neighborhood have died," Udin said Tuesday [9 Feb
2010]. Laboratory tests on the dead chickens in Way Laga subdistrict
showed that the birds were infected with the avian flu virus.

A doctor treating the patient said the medical team had to wait for
lab tests to determine whether she had bird flu. "Even if the results
turn out to be negative, residents in Way Laga must be careful
because the area is known to be a bird flu area," he said.

Two years ago, a bird flu outbreak took place in Way Laga and
infected thousands of birds owned by residents "We burned the
chickens which died abruptly in Way Laga, but many residents refused
to hand over their chickens to be culled despite showing signs of
infection," Lampung Health Office head Reihana said. Data at the
Lampung Animal Health and Livestock Office shows that in January this
year [2010], 2714 of the poultry population of 102 340 had died, and
17 739 had been culled.

Lampung Animal Health and Livestock Office animal husbandry division
chief Sunaryo Kasman said his office had urged farmers to monitor the
health of their chickens. "We have sent 750 volunteers to prevent the
bird flu virus from spreading," he said. The farmers were also
advised to monitor poultry traffic. Lampung Animal Health and
Livestock Office will provide 750 volunteers with training as part of
its efforts to reduce poultry deaths.

[Although avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection has been confirmed
in the sick chickens of their hospitalised owner, the diagnosis of
her infection has still to be confirmed by laboratory analysis. Until
that has been completed, she remains a suspected case. Information on
the outcome would be welcomed.
