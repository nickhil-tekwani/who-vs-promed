Indonesia confirms deadly bird flu outbreak
-------------------------------------------
The deadly H5N1 bird flu virus strain has been confirmed in Indonesia, but
there have been no cases found among humans.
The agriculture ministry's director for animal health says tests carried out
on the country's poultry show the subtype of the type-A avian influenza in
Indonesia is H5N1.
He says the results will be used by the government to determine the strain
of vaccines which will be used to eradicate the flu. [see commentary].

Poultry business in Pakistan suffers huge losses due to bird flu outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since [the initial] outbreak of the bird flu disease in Pakistan last
month, poultry business in the country has suffered huge losses.
Despite government claims that the virus identified in the affected
chickens does not harm humans, yet chicken consumption has nose-dived.
According to government estimates, chicken sale has plunged by more than 50
per cent and the prices have registered a decline of over 40 per cent
Over 4 million chickens have been killed in Karachi since November when
the first few cases of the disease were detected there.
But there are no indications that this disease has caused any damaged to
human life.
In fact, the government is leaving no stone unturned in explaining that the
disease was different from the one reported in many East Asian countries
where several human casualties have also been reported.
Head of the Poultry Vaccination Department, Dr Islamuddin, said: "In our
country, the laboratories which have isolated the virus [claim they
are] H7 and H9. It affects only birds, not human beings." [In
Pakistan's notification to the OIE, they said: "H7 strain of avian
influenza virus was detected". Mod. AS].
The government is doing its bit to control the damage. The federal
cabinet has banned cross border and inter-provincial movement of
chickens to minimize the effects of the virus and has sought
technical assistance from Food and Agriculture Organization to fight
the disease in the affected parts of the country.
Vaccination programmes are also being introduced throughout the country to
halt the spread of the disease.
Whatever the explanation from the government or the poultry industry, the
general public has chosen the simplest way of staying away from this chaos
and confusion.
"People are saying that the chicken is affected with some disease so most of
the people are not buying chicken now. That's why now people are turning
toward fish because we don't want to get sick," said a Pakistani.
The weekly poultry Bazaar in the heart of Islamabad attracts hundred of
buyers every week. But after a week of media reports about this
deadly chicken disease, it looks deserted.
However, there are many who have faith in what the official media,
especially the state run Pakistan Television is trying to tell them with the
help of scientists and researchers.
While this debate on the causes, impact and magnitude of the disease goes on
at the national level, what has suffered the most is the poultry business.
Most of the several hundred thousand workers related with this industry are
faced with harsh business conditions in the days and weeks to come.

Another bird flu outbreak confirmed in China
--------------------------------------------
The Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on Tuesday confirmed a previously
suspected outbreak of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in Chao'an
County in south China's Guangdong Province. The confirmation was
based on tests from the National Bird Flu Reference Laboratory. The
Chao'an County government has been taking measures including fowl
slaughter and compulsory immunization to prevent the spread of the
outbreak, which is now under control. In addition, the ministry on
Tuesday also declared seven more areas where outbreaks of suspected
bird flu cases have been found. They are Lanzhou City and Jingyuan
County in northwest China's Gansu Province, Fuyang and Jieshou cities
in east China's Anhui Province, Pingjiang County in central China's
Hunan Province, Xiangfan City in central China's Hubei Province and
Xi'an City in northwest China's Shaanxi Province. As soon as the
suspected cases were spotted, local governments began slaughtering
chickens and implementing compulsory quarantine measures. Samples
have been sent to the National Bird Flu Reference Laboratory. No
person has been reported to have contracted the disease. Special task
forces have been sent from the Ministry of Agriculture to help local
governments implement quarantine measures and contain the spread of
the epidemic. Latest situations have been reported to the Food and
Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the World Health
Organization. Meanwhile, some black swans died unusually in a wild
zoo in Shenzhen, Guangdong's boomtown neighboring Hong Kong and some
specialists have arrived there to make investigations. Before the
latest outbreak, bird flu had been confirmed in Long'an County of
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Wugang City of Hunan Province and
Wuxue City of Hubei Province.
