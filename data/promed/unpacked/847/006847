Two subscribers questioned my suggestion that maybe some 10-25 percent of the Nigerian butchers of stray dogs with inapparent rabies might have antibodies.

The study quoted stated: "A study conducted in southeastern Nigeria, whose native population consumes dog meat as part of the traditional diet, detected the rabies virus in the saliva and brain tissue of 5 percent of slaughtered dogs. Researchers also confirmed that butchers take few precautions around symptom-free dogs prior to slaughter, using their bare hands to muzzle animals without using adequate protection against bites, potentially placing butchers at high risk for contracting rabies."

The paper quoted no rabies cases among the dog butchers, thus my speculative hypothesis that some may have developed immunity without the benefit of vaccination.

Though it is believed that rabies has a 100 percent mortality rate, to quote the song, "it ain't necessarily so." See the following:

[1] Rabies in Caribbean mongoose, taken from "The biology of the mongoose in the Caribbean," by David Nellis & C Everard, Foundation for Scientific Research in Surinam and the Netherlands Antilles, Utrecht, 1983, pp 134-135: briefly, they reported a fluxuating level of the disease in trapped mongoose, from 3.7 percent in 1968, to 0.5 percent in 1970, to 3.5 percent in 1971, with a gradual decline to 0.14 percent in 1977. Rabies SN antibodies at a titre over 1:5 were found in 498 of 1675 (29.7 percent) mongoose tested between 1971 and 1974. The lowest percent antibody protected, 9 percent or 3/33, were in northern Grenada and 54.5 percent (30/55) on the central west coast. Of 127 mongooses 7.1 percent had titres over 1:1000, and the highest titre was 1:5900.
