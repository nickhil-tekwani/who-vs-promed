Re: Avian influenza (64): Nepal (Katmandu)
--------------------------------------------
I want to comment on the news item published on ProMED with the link: http://www.nzweek.com/healthlifestyle/bird-flu-case-found-in-nepali-capital-34696/.

This report of a bird flu case found in the Nepali capital, published by David K. Barger, updated on 6 Dec 2012 in NZweek [Health & Lifestyle], is news from last year [2011]. This event happened during November 2011, and the episode was also reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) [see comment].

I want to inform you that there is no outbreak at present in that area and that if you have any queries, please contact the Directorate of Animal Health of Nepal at <ahd@healthnet.org.np>. We will clarify the statement.

Public panic and confusion have been created by this erroneous report, resulting in problems with different national and international agencies.

[The moderator and ProMED-mail regret this unfortunate error and thank Barun Sharma for drawing attention to the matter.

The official OIE report on the November 2011 outbreak, to which the correction refers, reportedly involved backyard chicken and duck holdings in Manahara Phat, Bhaktapur, in the province Bagmati. The Nepali report was submitted to the OIE on 2 Dec 2011; see, with map, at http://tinyurl.com/caepunb.

During 2012, 2 H5N1 outbreaks, both affecting commercial poultry flocks in the same province, Bagmati, have been reported to the OIE from Nepal. The reports, with maps, can be seen, respectively, at http://tinyurl.com/c9z93jn and http://tinyurl.com/boepvkw. - Mod.AS]
