Pasteur Institute Finds Ebola In Non-Primates
---------------------------------------
France's Pasteur Institute said Thursday it had for the first time
found traces of the lethal and mysterious Ebola virus in small,
non-primate mammals -- an important step in discovering its
source.
The virus causes hemorrhagic fever in humans with mortality rates
of up to 90 percent.
Ebola had been found in primates in the past, but no traces had
been detected in tests on thousands of bats, birds and rodents
captured in areas of Zaire or Sudan, where the first known cases
broke out more than 20 years ago.
Now, using sophisticated molecular biology tools, scientists have
detected significant viral sequences in 7 apparently healthy animals
caught at ground level in the Central African Republic.
It added that the traces of the virus were identical to Ebola strains
isolated in Zaire and Gabon. "The study should help research
toward finding the natural reservoir of the Ebola virus. It helps to
better pinpoint areas where infected animals may be found and
suggests new strategies for the detection of the virus,'' the
statement said.
The French researchers -- based in Paris and the Central African
Republic capital Bangui -- found traces of the virus identical to Ebola
strains isolated in the former Zaire and Gabon in the animals. They did
not find any live virus, but using molecular biology techniques were
able to find viral sequences in the apparently healthy animals. The
animals were caught at ground level -- casting doubt on current theory
that the virus is spread by flying mammals.
"This work provides evidence that different rodent species and one
shrew species have been in contact with the Ebola virus - terrestrial
species are concerned, contrary to the current hypothesis," the
spokesman said. "In addition, these results fit well with the history of
fauna in tropical Africa. They show that there is a common Ebola virus
subtype for Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo
and Gabon.
"This subtype differs from that of Ivory Coast. Recent studies have
concluded that fauna from the Congo basin clearly differs from the one
of West African regions. The evolution of virus seems to follow that of
the mammalian fauna, suggesting a common history."
