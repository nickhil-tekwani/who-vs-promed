[This is the 9th consecutive day with no newly confirmed cases with local transmission reported from Wuhan or Hubei province in its entirety in the past 24 hours. There are no newly suspected cases in Wuhan or Hubei. 35 new cases were confirmed, all of them imported.

According to the report above, a total of 81 589 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 35 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (31 Mar 2020) report was prepared. There were an additional 20 suspected cases reported, all imported. In addition, 6 deaths were reported, all from Wuhan. 51 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which continues to increase the number of newly confirmed cases on a daily basis. And Macau reported no additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

A total of 35 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China. Locations of importation were not available but the total number of imported cases is now 841. There are an additional 152 suspected imported cases. Clearly the challenge for China now is the identification of infections in imported cases, tracing their contacts, and preventing the recurrence of community wide transmission.

As best as I can decipher from the report above, there were 55 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 17 in imported cases. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 1075 of whom 226 were importations from abroad. 9 originally asymptomatic cases developed symptoms in the past 24 hours.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and will end it in Wuhan on 6 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world will be watching carefully to see if this is safe timing...

- Since [22 Mar 2020], there have been under 10 000 inbound travelers per day. The number is expected to decrease with the implementation of mandatory 14-day quarantine for all travelers (including short-term visitors) effective from today [1 Apr 2020].

- Persons arriving from overseas should return home straight after arriving at the airport. They should travel in their own vehicle or designated airport limousine bus or designated KTX train (reserved specifically for this purpose). They are required to sanitize their hands and wear a facemask during movement.

- The Korean government is promoting an Enhanced Social Distancing campaign from [22 Mar 2020 to 5 Apr 2020]. The KCDC is advising limited operation of high-risk facilities, businesses, and sectors and advising people to stay home and refrain from going outside, and minimize contact with coworkers at work. The KCDC again urged people to continue to refrain from attending religious gathering, going to indoor fitness or sports facilities, or otherwise engaging in activities that make it easy to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space, and maintain good personal hygiene including washing hands and covering coughs/sneezes.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 89 cases and 4 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (31 Mar 2020-1 Apr 2020) when there were 101 newly confirmed cases. A total of 9976 cases including 169 deaths were reported today, up from 9887 cases and 165 deaths yesterday [31 Mar 2020]. The daily newly confirmed case count had been at or below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 11 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 67.4% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeongbuk with 13.1% of the total cases reported. In the past 24 hours, Daegu reported 23.6% of the total newly confirmed cases while Gyeonggi represented 19.1% of the newly confirmed cases, and Seoul represented 15.7%. Quarantined imported cases represented 20.2% of the newly confirmed cases.

As seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases returning to South Korea. There are now 242 imported cases in quarantine with the 1st report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020, when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222). As in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

According to the information provided above they have now identified 560 imported cases, with 60% confirmed in the community and not through airport screening. More stringent control measures and monitoring have gone into effect today (2 Apr 2020) which they note may well deter incoming international travel to Korea. In addition, they are currently undergoing an enhanced social distancing which may help interrupt the ongoing transmission chains.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 110 574 cases, including 13 155 deaths, up from 105 792 cases and 12 428 deaths reported on 31 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 31 Mar 2020 and 1 Apr 2020 was 4782 newly confirmed cases, compared with 4053 newly confirmed cases between 30 and 31 Mar 2020 stable from yesterday's observations. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (44 773), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (14 787), and Veneto (9625), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 57.5% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Another active province is Piedmont with a total of 9795 cases and represents 10.3% of newly reported cases. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. It is now 23 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 21 days since the countrywide lockdown. The positive trend of decreasing daily newly reported cases seems to have broken with today's reports.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 215 081, including 5110 deaths, an increase from 188 530 cases and 3889 deaths. New York state, with 83 901 (39.0%) cumulative case reports and 7918 (29.8%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing. Daily reported case counts are accelerating in New Jersey (3559 newly confirmed cases 10.3%), Michigan (1719 newly confirmed cases 6.5%), California (1303 newly confirmed cases 4.9%), Louisiana (1187 newly confirmed cases 4.5), and Massachusetts (1118 newly confirmed cases 4.2%) to a lesser but increasing amount, Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness. The curve of interest, by date of onset of disease, is based on 25.8% of the number of cases plotted on the epidemic curve using date of confirmation of disease.

[Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 in Spain has been rapidly accelerating. As of today (1 Apr 2020), totals of 102 136 cases and 9053 deaths have been reported, up from 94 417 cases and 8189 deaths confirmed in the preceding 24 hours. The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is 188.0. It is now 2nd in Europe, behind Italy, and 3rd globally behind the USA and Italy, in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease and one clearly sees the trend for increasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 102 136 cases, 51 418 (50.3%) were hospitalized and 5872 (5.7%) were admitted to the ICU. The crude reported case fatality rate was 8.9% with more deaths occurring than reported ICU admissions.
