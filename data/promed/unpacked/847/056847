After at least 3 DHF deaths have been registered among the
inhabitants of the Ometepec [city] center, the citizens are facing an
outbreak that could evolve into an epidemic, if the local health
authorities do not intervene.

Taking as an example the case of San Luis Acatlan, where last year
[2009] the deaths of a young high school girl and a boy of the
tropical DHF were recorded, the Ometepec residents call for
intervention of the local government to demand that the health
protocols be implemented in case of outbreaks and epidemics.

[2] Honduras (Francisco Morazan)
Date: Mon 8 Feb 2010

<http://www.latribuna.hn/web2.0/?p=95327>


Governmental sources reported on [Mon 8 Feb 2010] that health
authorities had announced the possibility of declaring a new red
alert because of the increase in the number of cases of dengue in
Distrito Central [municipality of Francisco Morazan department]. The
new health authorities [there is a new President and administration
in Honduras. - Mod.TY] are losing control over the invasion of DHF
and classical dengue in the Capital [Tegucigalpa], where in the 1st
38 days of 2010, a record number [of cases] have been registered in
comparison with the last 5 years.

According to the data compiled by the Ministry of Health in
epidemiological week 4 [during the 1st 4 weeks of January 2010], the
country recorded 1406 cases of dengue fever, which represents an
increase of 57 percent, compared to the same epidemiological week of
2009. With respect to suspected dengue cases, 361 patients are under study.

[Despite the health authorities' calls on the population of the
capital to implement prevention measures, it remains the worst
affected with 667 cases of classical [dengue], a sign that the
incidence of cases in neighborhoods and settlements is not declining.
Also, during January and February 2010, one death and 361 DHF
suspected cases have been reported in the country.

Also, there is a delay in the certification of cases for reasons the
authorities yet have not specified; in relation to DHF, 8 cases have
been reported, 6 of whom are people residing in the Central District.

However, with the last death from last year [2009], which was
awaiting confirmation [the number] of deaths reached 15. Also [in
2009], there were 14 528 cases of classical dengue and 728 were DHF.

It has been detected that not only the rural sectors of the capital
had a high incidence of infestation of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_,
but residential sectors such as Miraflores, Cerro Grande, el Hato de
Enmedio, Loarque, Kennedy, and Las Colinas, among others, [were
infested] as well. Initially, the endemic zones for this disease
[vector?] were neighborhoods and settlements such as Villanueva,
Suyapa, El Carrizal, El Manchen, San Francisco, Flor del Campo, Los
Pinos, Tres de Mayo, Reynel Funez, and San Miguel, but now this
vector continues to gain ground in other sectors of the capital.

Moreover, in other medical areas, the different centers of public
hospitals, such as the Honduran Social Security Institute and
peripheral clinics, argue that the high demand for patient care from
this disease is due to [the fact that for the] past 3 weeks there is
no head of the National Dengue Program, and the other [factor] is
that the population is neglecting prevention measures. For his part,
the minister of health, Arturo Bendana, announced last week [week of
1 Feb 2010] that "dawn action" would be taken to verify if homes are
permitting [the presence of] mosquito breeding sites, and [actions]
up to fines may come.

The new rule, jointly with municipal authorities, would be designed
to require the residents to cooperate with measures against dengue
and those who do not comply with this ordinance, shall be subject to
punishment, which so far has not been detailed.

The deaths of 4 children and an adult from DHF so far this year
[2010] has led authorities of the southwestern Colombian city of Cali
to declare a health emergency, an official said. Municipal health
secretary, Alejandro Varela, made the state-of-emergency announcement
after saying that, between January and February [2010], 718 suspected
and symptomatic cases of dengue were attended at the city's public
and private medical centres. Of those, 111 cases have been confirmed
by means of diagnostic tests, Varela said. Those who died were a
24-year-old patient and 4 children.

The official made an "urgent" call in the local daily El Pais
[newspaper] asking parents "to take their children to emergency
services whenever they get a high fever. The problem of dengue in the
city is of supreme concern to the Public Health Secretariat. The
epidemiologists' report shows that those who died became sick inside
their homes, so it is essential that the community comply with and
immediately put into practice the recommended preventive measures,"
Varela said.

Authorities carried out fumigations in the different neighbourhoods
of Cali, capital of the province [department] of Valle del Cauca, to
keep the dengue from spreading. "We're taking the necessary measures
to help mitigate the proliferation of the dengue-carrier mosquito.
Educational and operational actions are being stepped up," Cali's
mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina said.

Dengue, a serious viral disease [with the virus] transmitted by the
_Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is characterised by high fever, intense
headaches, muscle pain, gastro-intestinal problems and rashes. DHF,
in addition to having symptoms associated with dengue, like fever,
headaches and joint pain, can also produce internal bleeding.

condition. Colombia has reported 2502 cases of dengue fever this year
(2010), with 594 of them becoming severe cases, according to the
latest report by the Department of Health. The 4 Feb 2010 Pan
American Health Organization Epidemiological Alerts (in Spanish

[5] Malaysia (Selangor)
Date: Tue 2 Feb 2010

<http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/index.php/malaysia/51619-who-warns-cyclical-spike-in-dengue-cases-11-now-dead-in-malaysia>


Selangor health officials are bracing to contain an anticipated sharp
increase in dengue cases following 11 deaths, 8 of which happened in
the state last month [January 2010]. "According to the World Health
Organization (WHO) the number of dengue cases spike in 2 year cycles
and the situation this year [2010] may get out of control if not
contained," state health executive councillor, Dr Xavier Jayakumar,
told The Malaysian Insider.

Dr Xavier, who disclosed that 1895 cases of dengue were reported in
Selangor for January [2010], chaired an emergency meeting with state
and local government health officials where he described the
situation as alarming. It is understood that changing weather
patterns were among factors which cause the cyclical spike in dengue
cases, but Dr Xavier said authorities had a window of about a month
to contain it before it peaks in March and April. "The spike started
in the last week of December [2009] and is steadily increasing."

To counter the increase, local government health officials are roping
in Alam Flora [solid waste management privatised contractor]
personnel as well as officers from the engineering and enforcement
departments, while more funds are also being allocated. "We intend to
come down hard on any premises whether residential, commercial, or
education where the mosquitoes are found breeding." As a new measure,
Dr Xavier said authorities will no longer carry out surprise checks
but will announce their arrival in advance so the public will have no
excuse if mosquitoes are still found breeding in their compounds.

To date, construction sites amounted to 50 percent of cases where
mosquitoes have been found breeding; of these, schools accounted for
17 percent and factories for 28 percent. Dr Xavier lamented they were
not getting enough support from the public to counter the threat
especially during this period which is the run-up to Chinese New Year
[14 Feb 2010]. Those leaving empty houses to return to their
hometowns are urged to ensure there's no stagnant water including in
toilet bowls, where mosquitoes can breed.

Meanwhile those who have fallen victim to the disease last month are
between 14 and 40 years old, from urban areas in the Klang Valley.
Shah Alam had 4 deaths followed by one death each in Petaling Jaya,
Subang Jaya, Kajang, and Ampang Jaya. There were 88 deaths attributed
to dengue last year [2009] and Selangor accounted for 48 of the fatalities.

A building company was fined SD 2,000 [USD 1400] after authorities
found 18 confirmed cases of dengue fever at its site in Balestier.
This forms the largest dengue cluster this year [2010]. Authorities
found 2 mosquito breeding grounds at the site along Akyab Road.

Last week [week of 23 Jan 2010], dengue fever cases in Singapore rose
to 131 -- a sharp 70 percent increase from the previous week. The 18
cases were construction workers from China and Bangladesh, aged
between 21 and 45 years old. The builder said it will increase pest
control checks from once to twice a week.

"I was bitten by mosquitoes. It's red all over my fingers, my legs
also. About one week ago, my daughter was also bitten," said a woman,
a resident at a neighbouring condominium.

<http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/02/06/city-braces-dengue-fever.html>


The [Jakarta] city health agency is gearing up to face a spike in
dengue fever attacks as 914 cases have been recorded in 2 months.
Agency head Dien Emawati said on Friday [5 Feb 2010] her agency would
provide 20 beds and medical staff in 5 community health centers,
including in Ciracas in East Jakarta, Cempaka Putih in Central
Jakarta, and Cilincing in North Jakarta. "We will give priority to
health centers that are far from hospitals. The patients won't need
to go to the hospital so we can reduce the burden on hospitals," she said.

The agency reported that the number of dengue fever cases reached 914
as of 3 Feb [2010], a 25 percent decline from the same period last
year [2009]. The 1st 2 months of 2009 saw 1202 cases, with total
incidents reaching 18 000.

Dien said most of the cases occurred in East Jakarta, which recorded
309 cases, followed by South Jakarta with 267 cases, North Jakarta
with 131 cases, West Jakarta with 123 cases, and Central Jakarta with 84 cases.

She said the agency would follow up reports on the treatment of
patients suspected to be suffering from dengue fever by positively
identifying the disease. "We will fumigate in areas where dengue
patients reside," she said. She said the fumigation would cover a
radius of 200 meters from patients' houses as the virus-carrying
mosquito could fly that distance. Dien said her agency faced
difficulties when fumigating in upscale neighborhoods. "Usually the
residents are reluctant to open their house, citing privacy
concerns," she said, adding that persuasion would be key to getting
the job done in these areas. She said sub-district unit heads played
an important role in getting the message across. "The head of the
subdistrict unit has to notify the residents a few days before
fumigating." Dien added that residents who refused to have their
house fumigated should realize that virus-carrying mosquitoes do not
discriminate. "Everyone, including the more affluent, should take
precautions against dengue fever. Treatment that comes 5 days late
won't prevent death," she said.
