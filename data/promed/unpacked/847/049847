Some [coffee growers] societies in Central Kenya have appealed to the
government to assist them due to destruction of part of this season's
[2010] crop by coffee berry disease.

The government has in the past waived debt owed by co-operatives. Coffee
production plummeted from 130 000 metric tonnes in 1988 to an average of 50
000 in recent years, due to various reasons.

[Coffee berry disease (CBD; also called green berry anthracnose) is caused
by the fungus _Colletotrichum kahawae_. _Colletotrichum_ species have been
reported from _Coffea_ species wherever they are grown causing spotting and
blackening of fruit. A virulent strain of _C. coffeanum_, a species
reported from Brazil at the end of the 19th century, was considered the
cause of CBD, but the CBD pathogen has now been classified as a separate
species.

CBD occurs only in Africa and affects arabica coffee only with losses of up
to 80 per cent. The pathogen affects flowers, immature coffee berries, and
sometimes the beans. Infected berries display dark sunken spots coalescing
into lesions. Berry development may be arrested resulting in mummified
berries on branches. Infected berries are considered the major source of
inoculum, and spores are spread mainly by wind-blown rain or drops from
tree tops. Disease management includes cultural practices, quarantine, and
periodic fungicide treatments. Some resistant host cultivars exist, and
more are being developed.

Two coffee species are grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or
highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee).
Arabica is usually preferred for its taste.
