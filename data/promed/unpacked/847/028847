The European Commission today [21 Nov 2016] urged EU member states to "remain vigilant and enforce bio-security measures," following outbreaks of bird flu in poultry and wild birds across Europe.

The announcement comes after several international markets placed import restrictions on German poultry following an outbreak of bird flu in the country reported last week.

However, a commission spokesman for health, food safety, environment, maritime affairs and fisheries told Just-Food that there is, as yet, "no official confirmation" of any internal restrictions being placed on the trade in poultry between EU member states.

The spokesperson said that following the 1st reported bird flu outbreak in Hungary, which was notified to the commission on 4 Nov 2016: "There have been 6 further outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) of the subtype H5N8 in the same area."

In total, the spokesperson said that there have been 16 confirmed outbreaks of H5N8 in poultry in 5 EU countries: Hungary (7 cases), Germany (7), Austria (1), Denmark (1) and one case in a zoo in the Netherlands.

The virus has also been found, in wild birds only, in 7 EU states (Hungary, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands) plus Switzerland, and investigations are ongoing. "All affected countries took the necessary measures," the spokesperson said.

"With the exception of Hungary, most outbreaks have occurred in backyard (domestic) flocks, where bio-security levels are generally lower," the spokesperson added. "Member states have been urged to be vigilant and to enforce bio-security measures to possibly prevent contact between wild birds and poultry by putting poultry indoors."

The spokesperson said tests conducted by the EU reference laboratory for avian influenza "concluded that the virus is still predominantly a bird virus without any specific increased affinity for humans."

[An updated outbreak assessment of HPAI H5N8 in Europe by DEFRA's Veterinary & Science Policy Advice Team (International Disease Monitoring) is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/570883/hpai-europe-uoa-update3.pdf. The team stresses that these viruses to date are still essentially bird viruses without any specific increased affinity for humans. Their main conclusions:

"The risk to the UK is MEDIUM for any incursion of H5N8 HPAI in wild birds. The migration season will generally peak at around December [2016] to January [2017], when our migratory birds will be present at wintering sites in the UK, but these birds are already arriving and have been for several weeks. The risk to poultry depends upon the level of biosecurity implemented on farm to prevent the direct or indirect contact with wild birds. It should be noted that the virus could potentially survive on pasture in wild bird faeces for several weeks at current ambient temperatures, emphasising the importance of these measures."
