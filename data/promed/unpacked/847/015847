Physicians in the Ryazanskaya Oblast are concerned about an outbreak
of meningitis in children. At the moment, 7 cases of serous [aseptic]
meningitis have been reported, which is equivalent to the number
cases reported during the whole of last year [2007].

Children, including newborns, are the group at greatest risk of
serous [aseptic] meningitis. So far in 2008, a total of 60 cases of
serous [aseptic] meningitis has been recorded in the Ryazanskaya
Oblast.

The causes of the 7 meningitis cases remain undetermined, and there
has been no laboratory confirmation. All 7 children have recovered.

Treatment duration depends on meningitis severity: mild cases recover
within 2 weeks, whereas severe disease may be prolonged for a month
or more. Self-medication or treatment should be avoided.
Complications of serous [aseptic] meningitis can be very severe and
even fatal.

[Meningitis is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection.
Knowing whether meningitis is caused by a virus or bacterium is
important because the severity of illness and the treatment differ.
Viral ("aseptic") meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in persons
with normal immune systems. Usually, the symptoms last from 7 to 10
days, and the patient recovers completely.

Many different viruses can cause meningitis. About 90 percent of
cases of viral meningitis are caused by enteroviruses. These viruses
are more common during summer and autumn months. Herpesvirus and
mumps virus infection can also cause meningitis. Viral meningitis is
usually diagnosed by laboratory tests of spinal fluid obtained with a
spinal tap. The specific cause of viral meningitis can be determined
by tests that identify the virus in specimens collected from the
patient, but these tests are rarely done. No specific treatment for
viral meningitis exists at this time. Most patients completely
recover on their own. Enteroviruses, the most common cause of viral
meningitis, are most often spread through direct contact with the
respiratory secretions (e.g., saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus) of an
infected person or via fecal contamination of the person and the
environment.

Information on the identity of the agent responsible for this
outbreak would be welcomed.
