Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak in Hokkaido is not epidemiologically
related to three outbreaks in Miyazaki Prefecture
On 11 May 2000 the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan
announced a suspected Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak occurred in
Hokkaido, northern island in Japan. The farm had been controlled under
Prefectural Veterinary Inspectors according to the Inspection Programs
previously reported.
About 700 cattle were raised for fattening in the farm. They are Holstein
steers and F1 (Holstein-female x Japanese Black beefcattle-male). The
RT-PCR products of FMD virus were detected from the probang samples
collected from 2 Holstein steers, which have ELISA (Enzyme Linked
Immunosorbent Assay) antibody titers of more than 256 to FMD O type.
The Department of Exotic Disease Research of our Institute, Kodaira, Tokyo
is sequencing the VP1 gene of the products. The near future results of
sequencing will show you the relation of the gene to O/JPN/2000 isolated in
third outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture

All animals in the farm will be destroyed. The movement control area in a
radius of 10 km has been implemented. But [the original source of
infection [is still uncertain.
