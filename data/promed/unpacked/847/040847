According to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], a soldier, whose identity has yet to be determined, dropped off a wounded black puppy on 28 Aug 2013 at a veterinary clinic in the Golan Heights town of Katzrin then returned to an army base in the area. The puppy was later found to have contracted rabies.

Following the diagnosis, the Health Ministry immediately notified the IDF, requesting that the army track down the soldier, who authorities believe may be in need of critical treatment.

Once the rabies virus penetrates a subject's body, he or she must be vaccinated as soon as possible before the virus can make its way to the nervous system. If the subject is not vaccinated in time, symptoms will begin to develop, ultimately leading to the subject's death, as there is currently no effective treatment for the disease once it has spread.

As of Monday [9 Sep 2013], authorities said the soldier had yet to be located. In 1996, an IDF soldier died of rabies after he was bitten in his sleep by an infected wild [small, unidentified] animal.

The Health Ministry urged anyone who may have been in contact with the puppy to seek medical assistance as soon as possible. The ministry further advised individuals who had been in contact with another rabid canine, a large German shepherd belonging to a family in the northern town of Sha'al, to seek immediate assistance as well.

[The Israeli Ministry of Health is engaged in a rigorous effort to locate the person (soldier) who may have been exposed to the puppy at the beginning of its clinical rabies phase; reportedly, the animal died on 7 Sep 2013, about 10 days after its last contact with the person. The whole event took place on the Golan heights in north-east Israel bordering Lebanon, Syria, and north-west Jordan, a region witnessing an exacerbation of canine rabies during the recent 4 years.

The epidemiology of rabies in Israel has undergone a striking change since 2009, namely a significant increase in dog-mediated rabies in the north-east. The implementation of a fox-targeted oral vaccination programme (ORV), starting during the late 1990's, has almost eliminated fox-mediated rabies, which had been predominant for decades. The recent deterioration, affecting NE Israel where stray dogs and jackals have become the predominant rabies vectors, can be explained by the results of investigations carried out by the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) during 2004-2007.

Rabies virus isolates from foxes and dogs were found to differ in their molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct, separate lineages (see reference below). The transition from fox-mediated to dog-mediated rabies, combined with the high prevalence of canine rabies (also called "urban rabies") in Syria and Jordan and with lamentably interrupted control upon the stray dog population in Israel, is of great concern to public health because of the close contact between dogs and the human population. Jackals, unlike foxes, seem to be susceptible to the same virus lineage as dogs.

Syria, Jordan, and other countries in the Middle East are long known to be infected by dog-mediated rabies and do not apply oral vaccination.

Implementing ORV in a single country within a rabies-stricken region lacking efficient control systems is liable to difficulties. This was predicted by experts during the 1990's, indicating the vital need for coordinated regional effort.

Since the beginning of 2013, there have been a total of 23 lab-confirmed rabies cases in animals (16 dogs, 4 cows, one horse, one wolf, one jackal). Their static map is available at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/27AF2AE4-F690-4D78-8C0D-163E51D1CE17/0/mapa_mikre_kalevet_26813.pdf. A dynamic map providing details of each case is available at http://tinyurl.com/qcr8bnd.

The deteriorating conditions in war-stricken Syria are obviously contributing to the animal health situation on the Golan Heights. According to a recent FAO report, "Animal vaccination has also stopped in Syria, yet desperate farmers are selling their livestock outside the country. Cases of rabies, bovine TB, and severe afflictions such as lumpy skin disease have already spread from Syria to neighbouring countries in what the FAO calls "a serious regional animal-health problem waiting to explode;" see at http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24157#.UimDejbIbjE (thanks to Correspondent Susan Baekeland).

Israel's State Veterinary Services (Ministry of Agriculture) have intensified their efforts to vaccinate all domestic dogs on the Golan heights. Free-of charge revaccinations have been added to the regular owners' paid annual vaccinations. Domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, horses) have been vaccinated as well.

The last human case of rabies in Israel occurred in 2003. A Bedouin woman, 58, died of rabies in Be'er Sheva's Soroka Hospital on 9 May 2003 after being bitten by a cat 6-8 weeks earlier (see 20030511.1170).
