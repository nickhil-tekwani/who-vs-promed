Of 70 children who were admitted to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur, 9 died due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), the hospital said on Saturday [29 Aug 2020]. As per the hospital's report on 29 Aug [2020], a total of 56 children were discharged so far after recovering post-treatment from the hospital.

There are 2 children admitted to the PICU [pediatric intensive care unit] in the hospital. Last year [2019] over 140 children died due to AES in the district.

AES is a viral disease that causes flu-like symptoms such as high fever, vomiting, and in extreme cases, brain dysfunction, seizure, and inflammation of the heart and kidney.

[Although there was a lull in Japanese encephalitis and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) cases in Bihar state earlier in the season, new cases are appearing. As of 16 May 2020, there were 48 cases of AES and 5 deaths due to the disease reported this year (2020) in the state. A 16 May 2020 report indicated that an 8-year-old girl died of AES, bringing the total deaths in Bihar state to 6 at that time. (https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/may/16/bihars-aes-death-toll-reaches-six-after-death-of-minor-girl-in-muzaffarpur-district-2144107.html). A report on 17 Jun 2020 indicated there had been a total of 11 deaths in Bihar as of that date this year (2020) (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/two-more-kids-die-of-aes-in-muzaffarpur-toll-reaches-11-in-bihar/articleshow/76423591.cms). The report above indicates that there are 9 deaths among the 70 children admitted to hospital.

The report above does not indicate how many of the 70 AES cases are due to Japanese encephalitis. As mentioned in many previous ProMED-mail posts, the issue of the etiology of AES has been under discussion for a long time. AES has continued to be attributed to various etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible Japanese encephalitis (JE), enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, intoxication from lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue.

The report above does not indicate whether any of the etiologies above have been ruled out or confirmed. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. The season in which AES and JE cases is underway and additional cases can be expected over the coming 2-3 months. - Mod.TY
