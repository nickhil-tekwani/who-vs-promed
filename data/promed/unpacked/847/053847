[Egypt's awaited official notification on this major, exotic SAT2 epizootic is welcomed; it has been preceded by Libya's notification of its FMDV SAT2 outbreak, submitted 12 Mar 2012, available (with map) at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11741.

According to the Egyptian notification, samples have already been sent to the WRLFMD (Pirbright); their "pending" results are anticipated with great interest. The genotyping of 3 Libyan FMDV SAT2 isolates (designated LIB/39/2012; LIB/40/2012; LIB/41/2012), received at Pirbright on 27 Feb 2012, has already been completed; its publication on the WRLFMD website is awaiting approval from the Libyan authorities (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/lib.htm).

The most recent (December 2011) available recommendations from WRLFMD on FMD SAT2 virus strains to be included in FMDV antigen banks, are:
- High priority: SAT2 Saudi Arabia (or equivalent) [The Saudi Arabia (2000) SAT2 strain belongs to topotype VII, sharing it with Eritrea 1989 SAT2 strain].
- Medium priority: SAT2 Zimbabwe
- Low priority: SAT 2 Kenya.

The genotyping report of the Libyan strain and the results of the pending tests of the Egyptian samples, are essential for the vaccine strain(s) eventually selected to be included in the vaccines applied for mass vaccinations in Egypt, Libya, and other parties in the region. They will also assist the investigation into the origin of the outbreak(s) in both counties. - Mod.AS
