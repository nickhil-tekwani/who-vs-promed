A bacterial disease is threatening banana cultivation in the
Sainthamaruthu area in Ampara district.

The situation has become worse. Affected banana plants show features
such as yellowish leaves and fallen trunks, a report said.

Families partly depending on banana cultivations urgently need
assistance from agriculture experts, the report added.

[Bacterial pathogens of banana known to occur in Asia include species
and strains of _Ralstonia_ (wilts, gumming) and _Erwinia_ (rhizome
rots). Blood disease caused by members of the _R. solanacearum_
species complex is suspected to be spreading from Indonesia to other
countries in the region (see ProMED-mail post 20090727.2643). However,
the symptoms of leaf yellowing and collapse of plants described above
are not sufficient for diagnosis and molecular or microbiological
tests are needed.
