How true the old adage: 'he who fails to read history is doomed to repeat
it'.
Minamata Disease first raised its dreadful head in early 1956 when a 5-year
old girl was admitted to the Chisso Company Hospital in Minamata with a
strange, unfathomable illness afflicting the central nervous system.
Several other cases of this "Strange Disease", so labeled by the populace
followed. Numerous other cases appeared in all age groups, and the bizarre
symptoms so stigmatized sufferers that they were avoided by neighbors and
the public in general and treated like lepers of biblical times. The cause
was eventually traced to the Chisso Company, originally a producer of
carbides and fertilizers (whence the name: Chisso means 'nitrogen' in
Japanese). Cats, too, were afflicted, showing strange behavior, whirling in
circles; those falling off a sea wall and drowning were labeled "suicides"!
Dogs and pigs were also affected.
When Chisso became a manufacturer of petrochemicals, one of its products
was acetaldehyde, used to make a variety of plastics and drugs. To produce
acetaldehyde, a catalyst is needed and mercury, as organic mercury (methyl
mercury), met the need; the effluent was dumped into Minamata Bay. By some
accounts, around 200,000 tons of methyl mercury were dumped into the Bay,
producing a sludge on the bottom. Victims chronically exposed to the
environmental mercury showed high levels of mercury in their hair (up 200
ppm). Fish, the dietary staple, were similarly poisoned.
Steven Rose, writing in the New Scientist states in "Notes from Minamata"
(1978, 80: 628-629 Nov. 23) that there were more than 8,100 persons on the
register of victims, with 10 or more being added each month. A
comprehensive account of this episode, with numerous photographs, is given
in the book by W. Eugene Smith and his wife, Aileen M.Smith MINAMATA. The
story of the poisoning of a city and of the people who chose to carry the
burden of courage. 1975. Holt, Rinehart and Winston. New York. The book
also carries Minamata Disease: A Medical Report by Masazumi Harada, an
authority on the disease. This would appear to be the same Dr. Harada who
conducted the current study in Brazil and played such an important role in
the Minamata disaster.
