[This is an excerpt from a longer report on violence in Borno state, Nigeria. - Mod.TY]

In Baga, a fishing village near Lake Chad, a suspected cerebral fever has killed scores of people since December last year [2013] but residents have been unable to seek treatment.

"People are dying like fowls," said [a local resident].

["Cerebral fever" is a term too vague to suggest a diagnosis or even if the etiological agent is infectious or a toxicant. Other key information is also missing including the time over which the cases occurred, the number of cases by age and sex, any other symptoms, presence or absence of cases in other nearby places, etc. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving any of this information.

The current population of Baga is not available. Almost 200 people were killed in Baga in May of last year (2013) and over 2000 houses and businesses were destroyed in a conflict in the area between the Nigerian army and Boko Haram insurgents.

A HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of Nigeria can be seen at http://healthmap.org/r/77fQ. Baga is a village located on a peninsula that projects into Lake Chad on the Borno, Nigeria side of the lake.
