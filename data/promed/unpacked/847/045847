[Regarding the comment of moderator AS to the previous posting, referenced
below]

I'm sure I won't be the only person responding to this. It is not certain
that PCV-2 causes PMWS. Indeed, it is accepted that the disease cannot be
reproduced by infections with PCV-2 alone. The experimental reproduction of
disease requires other organisms such as PRRS or PPV.

PCV-2 is ubiquitous in pig herds in much of the world and can be found in
most herds affected by and in most herds not affected by PMWS. The role of
PCV-2 is not yet clear; that's what makes PMWS such a difficult disease to
combat.

[A similar response has been received from Dr Malcolm Banks, Virology
Department, VLA, Weybridge, Surrey, UK, who wrote: "PCV-2 is clearly a
co-factor and a common denominator, but whilst it has been shown to be
necessary, it has not yet been proven to be sufficient on its own for the
expression of PMWS".

Both are gratefully acknowledged for their corrective comments, which
indeed fall in line with recent research.

Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV-2) has been implicated as the causative agent of
Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and has been closely
associated with Porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS).

PMWS (but not PDNS) has been reproduced in piglets by inoculations with
PCV-2 alone (Krakowka et al., Viral Immunol. 2002;15(4):567-82,
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12513928&dopt=Abstract>);

however, as apparent from a number of experimental studies, when inoculated
alone, PCV-2 does not consistently reproduce the disease. This observation
has driven speculation regarding the likely contribution of additional
factors that may have impacted upon the increased expression of these
syndromes in many countries, to which New Zealand may now have been added.

The controversial aspects of the issue have been recently demonstrated by a
suggestion to replace the terminology PMWS with porcine circovirus disease
(PCVD), raised in conjunction with a workshop held in Brussels on 15 May 2003.

A recent (Aug 2003) update on PMWS, by Michael Meredith, is available on
<http://www.aasv.org/news/story.php?id=671>.
Several papers on PMWS have been published in The Pig Journal Vol 51 - June
2003; abstracts available on
<http://www.pigjournal.co.uk/content/vol51abstracts.htm>.
