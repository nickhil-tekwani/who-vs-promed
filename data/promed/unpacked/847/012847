As I have been reading the recent ProMED-mail postings on the newly
described Australian bat viruses, I was thinking of a trip I took to
Indonesia where I ate some of the _Pteropus_ bats in question. I'm not
worried about the eating itself, however the skinning, evisceration, and
cutting up of the animals seems like a great way to be exposed to a virus
that could effect humans.
Both _Megachiroptera_ and some of the larger _Microchiroptera_ are eaten in
Indonesia, the Philippines, Micronesia, and elsewhere throughout the
Asia-Pacific region. In Menado, a city on the island of Sulawesi in
Indonesia, a trip to the local market can easily produce 10 species of bats
on a given day, both alive and already butchered. In Micronesia some
populations of flying foxes have been decimated because of demand for local
cuisine. Flying Foxes have been a traditional food for some Australian
Aborigine groups, though I'm not sure if this is true today or how
frequently they were eaten.
It might be interesting to do some serological testing for these newly
described viruses in areas where people have regular, close contact with
bats.
