On 9 Jun 2008 a jugular blood sample from a bull near Portland, North
Dakota, was submitted to the veterinary diagnostic laboratory at NDSU
(North Dakota State University.) The bull had been vaccinated in
April [2008] and turned out to pasture but did not receive a booster
vaccine. According to the owner, a cow had died of anthrax on the
same pasture the year prior [2007]. _Bacillus anthracis_ was
identified on a direct blood smear followed by culture.

A 2nd case occurred on 18 Jun 2008 in a 2-year-old Hereford cow near
Lisbon, ND. Gross post mortem revealed unclotted blood in the heart
and a large, dark, and friable spleen. PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) analysis of liver and kidney swabs was positive for _B.
anthracis_.

The 1st half of June [2008] was wet -- lots of heavy rain and I
suspect that has something to do with these cases. However, we have
not had the usual rush of samples that follows a positive diagnosis
and those that have come have been negative. So, it does not appear
to being blowing up like 2005 and 2000. [Yet - Mod.MHJ]

On another note -- we have had a bit of tularemia pop up in the
western and central part of the state lately. We had 4 cases in 2006,
none last year [2007], and now one already this year [2008].

[Our thanks to Neil Dyer and Andy Peterson for this information.

Both Portland and Lisbon are in eastern North Dakota, in the enzootic
area for anthrax in that state. Portland is NNW of Fargo, and Lisbon
is SW of Fargo, [which can be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail
interactive map at <http://healthmap.org/promed?v=40,-97.6,4>. -

Why the Portland bull was not protected by the April 2008 shot is
unclear as usually a single annual shot is adequate for cattle; it is
wise to give 2 to horses. The usual cause for ineffective vaccination
with Sterne, a live vaccine, is simultaneous antibiotic treatment, or
within 4 days or so of the vaccination.

I was warned of the Lisbon case by the referring veterinarian, Andy
Peterson, who took samples from it on 17 Jun 2008. The farm is in the
Sheyenne River Valley in an area of repeated anthrax outbreaks in the
past. When one can one should avoid necropsying possible anthrax
cases until one has ruled out anthrax. In the old days in the UK we
did this by taking blood smears from unexpected deaths, fixing, and
staining them, and checking for capsulated organisms at the farm. But
these days few veterinarians carry microscopes with them in the
field. Because of the increased soil contamination associated with a
field necropsy it is very important to ensure that the carcass is
burnt as soon as possible and the bloody soil placed in the fire.
Area decontamination is also a good idea. Also one should warn the
farmer to keep his dogs away from the carcass as their curiosity can
lethally expose them to this pathogen, in spite of their relative
resistance. - Mod.MHJ]
