A previously healthy 10-year-old boy is supposed to be the 1st-ever
fatality in the world directly caused by chikungunya fever. On 13 Jan
2006, this young boy awoke and felt a lot of body pain with an acute
fever. His grandmother gave him some paracetamol, but the situation
rapidly got worse, and he became comatose. He was admitted to Saint
Denis Hospital in a critical care unit, where he died within a few
hours despite aggressive management. Lumbar puncture [also known as
"spinal tap"] and cerebral CT scan did not favor a neurologic
chikungunya complication. An extensive search for all possible
infectious causes was undertaken by the Institute Pasteur in Lyon,
France. CHIK [Chikungunya] virus was the only pathogen found in this
case and the only explanation for the death. The family members
refused permission for a necropsy, so this is a diagnosis by default.

[ProMED is most grateful for the above information provided by Dr.
Lionel Suzon from Reunion island. The current epidemic of chikungunya
has spread at 2143 new cases per day for the past week. The island is
presently in the middle of the warm season, when mosquitoes are most
abundant. A map with the geographic location of the island can be
viewed at: <http://www.vacationstogo.com/images/ports/maps/1187.gif>. - Mod.RY]
[In the absence of a post-mortem examination, the exact
pathophysiology leading to the death reported above will continue as
pure speculation. One wonders if given the current outbreak activity
and attention to the outbreak in the islands off the east coast of
Africa if there might be other deaths occurring attributable to
chikungunya virus infection that in past would have fallen "below the
radar-scope". - Mod.MPP
