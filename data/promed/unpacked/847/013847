Human death toll may exceed 130
-------------------------------
The human death toll from the Bali rabies outbreak has almost certainly now
exceeded 100, and may now be higher than 130, but tracking the deaths has
become much more difficult, since the Bali newspapers appear to have
suspended reporting deaths throughout the month of September 2010.

The outbreak started on the southern tip of the Ungasan peninsula in
mid-2008, apparently originating with a single infected dog, which arrived
with his master from Flores. The master was apparently the first person
bitten and the fourth to die.

Through 6 Aug 2010, the Bali and Indonesian governments recognized 76 human
rabies deaths. I had a list of 64 victims identified by name and date of
death. Bali sources indicated that there had been at least 20 unreported
deaths in poor and remote villages.

The next officially stated toll was 98, after the 8 Oct 2010 death of a 32
year old male resident of Jalan Kartini, Wangaya, Denpasar.

According to Sanglah Hospital, the official rabies treatment center, 112
patients had been treated for rabies. This leaves 14 unaccounted for.

The unknown question is whether the count of 98 incorporates the previously
unreported deaths, or whether there were in fact 22 new reported deaths
from rabies between 6 Aug and 8 Oct 2010.

I know of 2 victims who were identified by name and date of death during
this time, and have been told of 2 others, not identified by name and date
of death. Thus, I suspect the count increased from 76 to 98 because of new
reported deaths. Add to those the 14 cases whose status is unknown and the
unreported cases, and 130-plus may be the actual toll.

On 21 Sep 2010, the Bali government signed a memorandum of understanding
with the Bali Animal Welfare Association (BAWA) and a separate memorandum
of understanding with the World Society for the Protection of Animals
(WSPA), which will facilitate and fund vaccinating the entire remaining
unvaccinated dog population of Bali within the next 6 months, if all goes
without further delay.

However, while the vaccination campaign should finally bring this outbreak
to an end, 2 years after it could and should have been isolated and
eradicated before ever leaving the Ungasan peninsula, human rabies deaths
resulting from bites suffered earlier are likely to continue to occur at
least through the end of 2010, and probably into 2011.

The public and political response to each bite will continue to present a
challenge to BAWA, WSPA, and local health officials, who must reassure the
public and politicians that the continuing deaths do not mean the failure
of the vaccination program -- only that it was begun 2 years too late,
after a failed attempt to quell the outbreak through selective vaccination
and culling.

[It is to be hoped that, as the dog vaccination initiative sponsored by the
WSPA and the BAWA is extended throughout all 9 regencies of Bali, the
number of new human cases of rabies will begin to decline and the final
human death toll will not greatly exceed the current estimate of 130.
