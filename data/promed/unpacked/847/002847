Four people have died from a diarrheal disease suspected to be cholera that has broken out in Chipili District of Luapula Province. Chipili Member of Parliament (MP) Davies Mwila confirmed this in an interview yesterday, 29 Jan 2013, after he visited the affected areas. "4 people have died at Kabongo Village in Chipili but the district health office is yet to establish whether or not it is from a cholera outbreak," he said. Mr Mwila said the outbreak was reported last week [week of 21 Jan 2013] and that a team from the Mwense District Health Office was yet to conclude investigations.

Mwense District Commissioner, Victor Kasuba, said in a separate interview that only one person had died from severe diarrhea after taking suspected contaminated water. "The outbreak in Chipili is not cholera, it is a mere diarrhoeal outbreak and only one person died from it because she drank contaminated water," he said. Mr Kasuba, however, confirmed one cholera case at Mukabi Village.

Luapula Provincial medical officer, Elicoh Bwalya confirmed that one person had died while 4 others were admitted to Mukonshi Health Centre near Chipili after a suspected cholera outbreak in the area.

Dr Bwalya said he was yet to receive reports from other health centres where medical personnel were investigating suspected cholera outbreaks.

One new case of cholera has been recorded in Lukanga Swamps in Kapiri Mposhi, bringing the total number of cases since September 2012 to 55 in Kapiri Mposhi and Kabwe.

Central Province medical officer Dickson Suya said in Kabwe yesterday, 29 Jan 2013, that the latest patient is admitted to Waya Health Centre.

Dr Suya said the Lukanga Swamps are still a problematic area in containing the waterborne disease. He said medical authorities in Kapiri Mposhi have continued conducting education campaigns in Lukanga Swamps to reach fishermen and fisher mongers. He appealed to Central Province residents to observe hygiene, avoid unnecessary handshakes and crowded places to help curb the disease.

Meanwhile, medical officials in Kapiri Mposhi and Kabwe have called for closure of all fishing camps in Lukanga Swamps if cholera is to be contained in the 2 districts.

[3] Cholera - Uganda (Nebbi District)
Date: Wed 30 Jan 2013

A cholera epidemic has hit 6 villages in Dei parish, Panyimur sub-county in Nebbi district. According to the Uganda Red Cross (URC) the epidemic attacked the area this month [January 2013].

The URC head of communications, Catherine Ntabadde, said the disease followed a case at Dei Heath Centre II in Nebbi on 17 Jan [2013], where a business woman from Ogwedo village from Buliisa district was admitted at the health centre and was found with signs of excessive watery diarrhoea.

"She was later moved to her home by her relatives, from where 2 other children in the neighbourhood of Dei and Munduryema villages developed similar symptoms and died shortly after," Ntabadde noted.

She said medical reports indicate that it was cholera, which killed them and has eventually spread throughout the 6 villages of the parish and other neighbouring areas of Buliisa. The affected villages include Dei, Dei A, Dei B, Dei C, Dei centre, and Namutangna village.

She noted that 28 cases of cholera had been registered since January [2013] when the outbreak was reported. "Many of the cases have been discharged and only 3 are still admitted at Dei Health Centre II for surveillance," she added.

To date 9 people have died from cholera while 300 others are receiving treatment after an outbreak that hit several fishing camps and a village along the Lake Rukwa Basin in Sumbawanga District.

The epidemic is believed to have erupted after villagers served themselves with contaminated food and water. Camps for attending to victims have been set up at Nkwiro, Kalumbaleza, Nankanga, and Ilemba Uze.

Sumbawanga District Medical Officer (DMO), Dr Thomas Rutayazibwa said the authority has imposed a quarantine, banning any gatherings including open market activities and local brew pubs. Food vendors famous known as 'Mama Ntilie' have also been ordered to wind up their business.

[5] Cholera - Malaysia (Sabah State)

The public have been advised to observe strict personal hygiene and ensure the food and drinks they consume are free from contamination after 20 cholera cases were detected in the Papar district [Sabah State, Borneo] in January 2013.

Deputy Health Minister Datuk Rosnah Abdul Rashid Shirlin, in issuing the advice, said 4 of the patients had been discharged while 14 were still being treated at Papar Hospital. She said 18 of the cases were detected at the Temporary Detention Centre and the remaining 2 at Taman Limau-Limaun.

"I would like to remind everyone in the affected areas to always emphasise on cleanliness especially when preparing food. Cholera is known to thrive in unhygienic environment, so it is vital that everything is cooked and prepared properly," she said.

She said no new cases or suspected infections had been detected since early last week [week of 14 Jan 2013].
