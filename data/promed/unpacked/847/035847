Birds (domestic) / 3816 / - / - / 3816 / - / -

Affected population: On 12 Nov 2022, a commercial turkey fattening farm reported an increase in mortality of the birds. Samples were collected and submitted to the Irish Central Veterinary Research Laboratory for avian influenza testing. On 13 Nov [2022], these samples returned a result confirming the presence of avian influenza subtype H5N1. On 14 Nov [2022] the subtype was confirmed to be highly pathogenic.

Outbreak 2: Clones, Monaghan
Started: 17 Nov 2022
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds (domestic) / 4100 / - / - / 4100 / - / -

Affected population: On 18 Nov 2022, a commercial turkey fattening farm reported an increase in mortality of the birds.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: On 18 Nov 2022, a commercial turkey fattening farm reported an increase in mortality of the birds. Samples were collected and submitted to the Irish Central Veterinary Research Laboratory for avian influenza testing. On 19 Nov [2022], these samples returned a result confirming the presence of avian influenza subtype H5N1. On 22 Nov [2022] the subtype was confirmed to be highly pathogenic.

Control measures applied in domestic animals: zoning; traceability; surveillance within the restricted zone; stamping out; official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; movement control

Control measures to be applied in domestic animals: disinfection

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Last result date / Result
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory - DAFM / birds / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 18 Nov 2022 / positive
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory - DAFM / birds / gene sequencing / 21 Nov 2022 / positive

[Highly pathogenic avian influenza situation in Ireland:

The first outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1 (HPAI H5N1) in poultry in Ireland was confirmed on 14 Nov 2022. As a result, restriction zones consisting of a 3 km [1.9 mi] minimum radius protection zone and a 10 km [6.2 km] minimum radius surveillance zone were put in place. A 2nd outbreak was confirmed on 22 Nov 2022, which resulted in a slight extension to the existing restriction zones.

"On [18 Nov 2022], HPAI H5N1 was confirmed in a peregrine falcon in Co. Offaly. This follows the confirmation of HPAI H5N1 in a mute swan in Co. Cavan on [26 Oct 2022] and in pheasants in Co. Meath on [11 Nov 2022]. These cases of HPAI H5N1 demonstrates that the virus is present in wild birds in inland areas of Ireland, following cases found in wild birds in coastal areas since July [2022]."

"Avian influenza is highly contagious for birds. Due to the avian influenza surveillance carried out by DAFM [Department of Agriculture Food and the Marine], the disease is known to be circulating widely in wild bird populations, thereby presenting a risk of infection to Irish poultry and captive birds.

"The environment can become contaminated with virus through the faeces of infected birds. This presents a potential source of infection for poultry and captive birds.

"Biosecurity is the best defense against the spread of disease, including avian influenza, to a poultry flock.

"Members of the public are reminded not to touch sick or dead wild birds. Dogs should be kept on a lead when walking in areas where sick or dead wild birds are present.

"Poultry owners and those working with poultry should beware of visiting areas, both at home and abroad, where deaths of wild birds have occurred for example, coastal areas, bird colonies, etc.). Direct contact with sick or dead wild birds must be avoided."

Highly pathogenic avian influenza situation in Portugal:

In Portugal, between 30 Nov 2021 and 29 Sep 2022, 31 outbreaks of HPAI subtype H5N1 were confirmed: 19 of these outbreaks were in poultry, including turkey, chicken, and duck commercial farms; a private bird collection; and birds kept in urban parks as well as 12 detections in wild birds. The latest outbreak in poultry was confirmed on 29 Sep [2022] in a commercial farm of fattening turkeys located in the parish of Abrigada and Cabanas de Torres, municipality of Alenquer, district of Lisbon; on 21 Sep [2022], 2 positive wild birds were also identified on the beaches of Francemar, Vila Nova of Gaia and Fonte da Telha, Almada, respectively.

Following the outbreaks in poultry, health restriction zones were established: a protection zone and a surveillance zone covering, respectively, a 3 km [1.9 mi] and 10 km [6.2 mi] radius around each affected site. - Mod.CRD
