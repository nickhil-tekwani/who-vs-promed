[The French compilation of BTV-8 incidence in Europe is very helpful;
particularly since the reporting of some affected countries to the
OIE on the current epizootic is deficient, even erratic. While the UK
submits a weekly follow-up report (10 of them so far), other
countries are less meticulous. OIE's WAHID animal health interface
includes one single 2007 report from the Netherlands, dated 3 Aug
2007. - Mod. AS]

[2] Germany, losses in sheep; resistance in fallow deer.
Date: Sat 8 Dec 2007
From: Sabine Zentis
<CVLonghorns@aol.com>


The following is a description of the losses in a valuable flock of
250 sheep kept at Schaaeferhof, Marienheide. The family produces
cheese and yoghurt on the farm where 200 Lacaune dairy sheep are
milked twice a day. The 1st case of bluetongue was seen in August
2007. Up to now, 70 sheep have shown clinical disease, 12 died. 5 out
of 6 rams tested positive of which only 2 showed clinical signs. Milk
yield in the dairy sheep during August [2007] was 50 percent down on
last years' August [2006] and overall milk production for 2007 was 10
percent down compared to 2006. Additional costs (vet charges,
pharmaceuticals) were ca. 1000 Euro [about 1472 USD].

The lambing season will be prolonged and the farmer is already
fearing the worst in terms of problems with stillborn or weak lambs.

Fertility testing of 30 breeding rams on the surrounding farms showed
that 9 rams were infertile, 11 showed a very low fertility and only
10 were 100 percent fertile. Scanning of ewes showed that 15 percent
were barren.

[As to BTV-8 in fallow deer] we have now got first results of the
screening of farmed fallow deer at slaughter. 13 animals were
sampled, of which 7 [were] positive for antibodies but rtPCR negative.
This means that the animals had been infected last year [2006] or
that deer can eliminate the virus rather quickly. The owners claim
they have never seen any disease related problems.

Lethal bluetongue virus infection in an alpaca
----------------------------------------------
We would like to report a case of lethal bluetongue virus infection
in an alpaca in Germany. The affected animal was a 5-year-old female
alpaca, born and raised in a flock in a low mountain range area in
central Germany. This area was affected by the bluetongue virus
outbreak in Germany in 2007. Within a radius of 5 km [3.1 miles],
clinically evident bluetongue virus infection in sheep and cattle was
reported, with high mortality in affected sheep.

The alpaca herd was housed in an open stable with unrestricted access
to pasture during daytime, but was kept inside the stable at night
(including dusk and dawn); however, the stable was not completely
protected against flying insects.

Just 3 months before its death the alpaca gave birth to a healthy
offspring, which was weaned at the time of death of the mother. But 4
weeks before the animal died, it showed signs of colic with
recumbency and tympanic abdomen. The animal was degassed via
nasogastric intubation and recovered quickly, but the cause of the
clinical signs remained undetected.

Immediately before the fatal bluetongue virus infection, mother and
offspring were in excellent body condition, and neither showed any
signs of an
underlying disease.

Acute clinical signs started with 'hiccup-like' breathing and a
stertorous sound discernible via auscultation. One hour later the
animal was inappetent, recumbent and lethargic. Then, 7 hours later
the animal was observed coughing and mildly disorientated. A total of
14 hours after the first observation of signs the animal died.

On postmortem examination, the animal showed severe, acute, diffuse,
interstitial and alveolar oedema of the lungs. In the oral cavity,
single small erosions and ulcerations on the tongue, palate and
buccal mucosa could be observed.

As well as postmortem changes and acute congestion of the liver,
spleen and kidneys, histopathology revealed severe congestion,
interstitial and alveolar oedema of the lung, and mild hypertrophy of
type II pneumocytes.

Focal haemorrhages in the tunica media at the base of the pulmonary
artery, a common finding in bluetongue virus infections in sheep,
were not observed.

PCR revealed sequences of bluetongue virus in tissue samples (blood,
lymph nodes and spleen), whereas no sequences of ovine herpesvirus
type 2 were detectable.

The rest of the herd, including the offspring, remain healthy and show no
signs of bluetongue virus infection.

[The authors rightly indicate the absence of the changes in the base
of the pulmonary artery, which are very typical in sheep bluetongue.
Another change which seems to be lacking (or not observed?) is found
in sheep in the coronary bands of the hooves, which are often
hyperemic, with petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages.

Though the demonstration, by PCR, of BTV sequences in tissues of the
affected alpaca are suggestive of BTV being the possible causative
agent of the described per-acute clinical picture and PM findings,
such conclusion deserves caution. Experience in BT-endemic countries
has shown that during the peak of the disease season, a significant
percentage of (non-ovine) ruminants may undergo subclinical
inflection, thus the virus may be demonstrated in animals affected by
various other pathogens.

The above report will, hopefully, be followed by additional
observations which may confirm its significance. - Mod.AS]

Moredun chief sounds bluetongue warning
---------------------------------------
Moredun Research Institute in Edinburgh is a world-leader at a time
when animal health problems are increasingly becoming a global issue.

Professor Julie Fitzpatrick, the director of Moredun, said in her
annual report published yesterday [11 Dec 2007]:

"There can be no doubt about the threat of infectious diseases to
Scotland and the UK, and their impact on the livestock industry,
parliamentarians, policymakers and the general public.

"The list of diseases considered as exotic to the UK which reached
our shores in recent months include foot-and-mouth, Newcastle
Disease, avian influenza and bluetongue. We have to be ... prepared
for any eventuality."

However, for practical livestock farmers the big fear is that there
could be a serious outbreak of bluetongue in Scotland next year
following the arrival of this disease in East Anglia in September
[2007]. Losses in sheep and cattle have been minimal, but all the
evidence from Europe suggests that the 2008 scenario might be
radically more severe.

Prof. Fitzpatrick said: "Vaccines are under development and are
urgently required. However, the impact of living with such a policy
against bluetongue has not yet been fully thought through. Moredun is
establishing a working group to prepare our input into the
understanding of this disease, which we consider should be seen as a
new endemic disease in the UK."

Bluetongue is viewed by the farming community as the next potential
disease disaster. Compensation has been paid for the losses incurred
through FMD and bird flu, but no such provision exists for bluetongue.

Bluetongue conference on vaccination, Brussels - 16 January 2008
----------------------------------------------------------------
The European Commission is convening a "Conference on vaccination
strategy against bluetongue" that will take place in Brussels in the
Charlemagne building on 16 Jan 2008.

The bluetongue situation in the Community has considerably changed in
the last years. Vaccination is one of the veterinary measures that
can be implemented in an infected territory. Several Member States
have experience on the use of vaccination as a means to limit the
effects of bluetongue. This experience and the opinion of the
Scientific Panel on Animal Health and Welfare of EFSA on vectors and
vaccines were taken into account when drafting Commission Regulation
(EC) No 1266/2007, available at
<http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2007/l_283/l_28320071027en00370052.pdf>.

On the basis of the experience gained, and considering the new EU
legislation as regards bluetongue, it is appropriate to discuss the
use of vaccination against bluetongue as a means of controlling the
disease. For this reason the Commission is organising the above
mentioned Conference.

An invitation letter to the bluetongue conference is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/invitation_bt_conference.pdf>;
for the tentative agenda, see

[BTV-8 seems to be continuing its activity in December 2007,
particularly in France where it spreads south-westwards; a map showing
the location of the restriction zones as updated on 7 Dec 2007 can be
seen at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/BlueTongue_RestrictedZones.jpg>.

The EC has now realised the potential of this virus to seriously
affect the European farming industry; consequently increasing the
2008 budget dedicated to the fight against animal diseases: the total
EU contribution to these programmes is 70 075 000 Euro (103 178 142
USD), compared to 52 970 000 Euro (77 990 528 USD) in 2007. The
change is mainly due to an increased allocation to counter Bluetongue
disease in many Member states.
