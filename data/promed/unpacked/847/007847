Outbreak of killer bug hits tourists
--------------------------------------
By MARK DUNN and NICK PAPPS
Melbourne'S killer bug has spread overseas, striking down two victims in
New Zealand and another in England. Forty-seven people have been hit by
Legionnaire's disease and 39 more face an anxious wait for test results.
Two of the overseas victims visited the Melbourne Aquarium and the other is
believed to have caught Legionnaire's while standing 20m from the building.
In other developments yesterday:
A government test revealed a 400 per cent rise in bacteria in the
aquarium's air-conditioning cooling towers on 27 Apr 2000 Â­ the day the
contamination became known. The towers have been given the all-clear by
health authorities. AT least two victims caught the disease near the
aquarium without entering the building. Nine Victorians are now critically ill.
Six hundred people have given samples after becoming concerned they have
Legionnaire's [disease. Private labs are running out of urine testing
solution [there is a commercially available urinary antigen test for
_Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 which is the most common etiologic
agent of legionellosis -DS.
Health authorities confirmed last night a woman, 74, is in a British
hospital with suspected Legionnaire's disease. Another Briton, a
69-year-old male tourist, is among confirmed victims in hospital in
Victoria. A man, 40, is in a New Zealand hospital with the disease and
another New Zealander, 16, is believed to be infected.
The New Zealander confirmed with the bug [to be infected, is on an
intravenous drip [for antibiotic administration in New Zealand's
Palmerston North Public Hospital. His sister, said her brother did not
enter the aquarium but stood 20m away under a viaduct. She said he became
ill a few days after returning to New Zealand on 18 Apr 2000. The
16-year-old New Zealander suspected of having the disease visited the
aquarium and returned home last week, vomiting and suffering from chronic
tiredness.
It has also been revealed a St Kilda East man, 26, who is in a critical
condition, caught the bug [infection while walking past the aquarium.
The Herald Sun has learned the 27 Apr 2000 Human Services Department test
found a 400 per cent rise in the level of bacteria in a month. The level
rose from under 1000 forming [colony-forming units per millilitre to
30,000-40,000. The April 27 sample results were sent to the aquarium
management last night. The aquarium's biological consultant, Dr Vyt Garnys,
said the rise may be due to outside causes.
"It might be an external event which caused it," he said. "It may be some
mild event that may have occurred." Dr Garnys said the CFU figure was far
below the allowable risk level of 500,000 CFU.
Speculation on an external cause of the outbreak follows reports that dust
at a viaduct worksite near the aquarium may have entered the
air-conditioning. A Federation Square worker with Legionnaire's who has
never visited the aquarium has come out of intensive care at Monash Medical
Centre.
