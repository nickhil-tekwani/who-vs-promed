Orange rust, caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_, was observed on 27 Mar 2018 at Reduit [town] on 6 months old plants of a non-commercial sugarcane variety M 2705/06. Its identity was thereafter conﬁrmed. This variety also planted in trials at [the towns of] Valetta, Rose Belle, and Medine presented the same symptoms.

Orange rust symptoms should not be confused with those of brown rust, caused by _Puccinia melanocephala_, that tends to aﬀect young canes

[Orange rust of sugarcane caused by the fungus _Puccinia kuehnii_ has the potential to cause significant economic losses to the crop. Symptoms include minute, elongated yellow lesions, which develop an orange to orange-brown colour as they expand. Most rust pustules occur on the lower leaf surface with more lesions toward the leaf base. Disease development is favoured by warm, humid summers and cool autumns, as well as by rain. The rust spores are rapidly spread by wind, mechanical means and with contaminated materials. Disease management includes fungicides and development of resistant cane varieties suitable to local requirements.

In Australia, _P. kuehnii_ had been present for 100 years, but in 2000, a much more virulent strain emerged devastating the then most widely grown sugarcane cultivar. Orange rust has been reported since then from the US (ProMED-mail post 20070731.2457) and additional countries in the Americas (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below), Asia, and West Africa. The report above may be the 1st identification of the pathogen in Mauritius.

It is not clear if scenarios similar to the Australian one with emergence of a new strain of a previously unrecognised endemic pathogen, have occurred in subsequent cases, or whether the pathogen has actually been introduced to new areas at various times. Characterisation and comparison of fungal isolates from the different areas would be needed to clarify this.

For brown rust caused by the related _P. melanocephala_, colour and distribution of leaf lesions vary from orange rust, and development of this pathogen is inhibited by rain.
