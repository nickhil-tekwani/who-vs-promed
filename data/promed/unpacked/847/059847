Anthrax update
-----------------
Here's a bit of a summary of where we are at with the anthrax
situation here at Wood Buffalo National Park (WBNP):
A bison carcass found 17 Jul 2007, near a back-country road, tested
positive for anthrax. Since then, 60 additional carcasses have been
found. Most carcasses have been found in an area of approximately 500
square kilometers [193 square miles].
A total of 14 carcasses have been treated. Of these, 12 have been
burned (using coal and wood) and 2 have only been treated with
formaldehyde to discourage scavenging. The balance of the carcasses
have not been treated as decomposition was very advanced and/or the
carcasses had been scavenged, and there is little chance of public
contact with the carcasses.
The last fresh carcass was found on 4 Aug 2007 and has been burned.
We are continuing with detection efforts in the area of the current
and historic outbreaks, but have only turned up a few older carcasses.
