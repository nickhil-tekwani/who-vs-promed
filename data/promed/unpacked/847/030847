The World Health Organization said today [25 Jan 2013], 2 Cambodians have died from bird flu contracted while preparing infected chicken. Tests on the victims, a 15-year-old girl and a 35-year-old man who died earlier this week, confirmed they had contracted the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, the WHO said in a joint statement with the Cambodian health ministry, AFP reports.

An 8-month-old boy admitted to hospital in Phnom Penh on 9 Jan 2013 was also infected with H5N1 [avian influenza virus] but later recovered, the statement said.

There was evidence of infections among poultry in the villages of the 2 who died and the "pair had prepared sick chicken for food," the statement said.

Cambodia has recorded 24 cases of H5N1 since 2003 with all but 3 of the victims dying. The virus has killed 362 people worldwide since a major outbreak in 2003, according to WHO statistics. It typically spreads from birds to humans through direct contact, but experts fear it could mutate into a form easily transmissible between humans, with the potential to trigger a pandemic.
