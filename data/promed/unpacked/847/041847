Mass bird mortality in a popular Siberian lake due to lethal toxin
------------------------------------------------------------------
About 600 ducks have died during the last 2 weeks in the popular
resort Lake Tagar in [Minusinsk district], Krasnoyarsk krai
[territory]. The regional veterinarians have been working hard to
identify the cause of the die off. They excluded one cause after
another. A similar die-off happened in the same place a year ago,
similarly in September [2010], affecting about 2000 ducks. At that
time the cause remained obscure -- in contrast to the current event.
The specialists have found that organic decay of vegetation in the
lake was the background to the production of the bacterium
_Clostridium botulinum_.

The bacteria produced toxins which accumulated in the weed growing in
the water. Then the ducks ate the botulinum toxin contaminated weed.
The specialists have recommended frightening off the birds since the
lake is a landing place for migratory birds. Additionally, all the
organic matter has to be removed from the lake and the water
oxygenated. The reed growth should be burned during winter. Nearby
water bodies are being treated the same way.

[Minusinsk District is an administrative and municipal district
(raion), one of the 43 in Krasnoyarsk territory, central Siberia,
Russia; see map at http://healthmap.org/r/1dQW.

Botulism is an intoxication caused by ingesting _Clostridium
botulinum_ exotoxin or by absorbing toxin produced in the alimentary
tract (toxico-infection). The causative toxin in birds is mainly of
type C.

The zoonotic potential of type C botulism is minimal, even negligible.
Only 4 poorly documented type C botulism intoxications have been
reported in people, but cases have occurred in nonhuman primates.

For more information on avian botulism, see moderator TG's detailed
comment in ProMED-mail posting 20100709.2294.

Botulism is not an OIE-listed disease, but may be included in annual
reports voluntarily. - Mod.AS]
