_Plasmodium knowlesi_ infection in German travelers returning from Thailand/Myanmar
----------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2013 a 73-year-old male German presented to a local hospital with a 5-day history of fever and chills beginning one day after return from a 3-week travel in Thailand and Myanmar. On admission, the patient was hypotonic and in respiratory distress. He rapidly developed shock and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and catecholamines. Since malaria was suspected the patient was transferred to our center by helicopter. On admission, blood smears revealed a 3 percent parasitaemia with trophozoites resembling _Plasmodium falciparum_ together with band-forms and gametocytes similar to _P. malariae_. Therapy with intravenous quinine plus doxycycline was initiated and parasites cleared from the blood within 48 hours. The patient developed acute kidney failure requiring hemodialysis. A ventilator-associated pneumonia was treated with meropenem. Subsequently, the patient rapidly recovered. However, hemodialysis was necessary for 5 weeks but kidney function finally recovered and the patient could be discharged without sequelae.

In November 2014 a 52-year old German woman presented at our OPD [outpatient department] with a 7-day history of fever and chills which started 16 days after return from a 3-week holiday in Thailand. Blood smears showed few ring forms of plasmodia (parasitemia 0.01 percent) resembling both _P. falciparum_ and _P. malariae_ (no band forms or gametocytes). The patient was admitted to the ID [infectious disease] ward and treated with a standard oral regimen of artemether/lumefantrine. The further course was uneventful, parasites and fever cleared within 2 days, and the patient could be discharged.

In both patients, a definite diagnosis of _P. knowlesi_ infection was made by an 18S rRNA PCR [1] and DNA sequencing of amplicons confirming more than 99 percent nucleotide concordance with _P. knowlesi_ strains from Thailand and Malaysia. Monoinfection was assured in both patients by negative multiplex PCR for the other 4 human _Plasmodium_ species.

_P. knowlesi_ is a parasite of macaques in Southeast Asia and rare infections in humans have been described decades ago. However, only recently _P. knowlesi_ has been recognized as an important cause of human malaria which may account for more than 50 percent of endemic cases in some areas such as the Malaysian part of Borneo (Kalimantan). In international travelers, 12 cases imported to their home countries have been published so far [2]. This includes 2 additional cases imported to Germany (in 2012 and 2013) which also occurred after return from travel to Thailand. All German patients had visited forested areas in Southern Thailand (Ranong province, Khao Sok, and Kra Buri National Parks) inhabited by the natural monkey host.

The majority of cases diagnosed in endemic areas present as mild disease. However in some patients _P. knowlesi_ may cause severe and life-threatening disease as in one of our patients. Diagnosis usually relies on microscopy whereas rapid tests are not reliable [3]. However, microscopic differentiation of _P. knowlesi_ from other plasmodium species is difficult especially when parasitemia is low and PCR methods are usually required for a definite diagnosis. Treatment guidelines recommend oral artemisinin combination therapy (such as, artemether/lumefantrine) for uncomplicated disease and parenteral treatment with artesunate or quinine in severe and complicated cases [4].

Travel Medicine and ID professionals should be aware of _P. knowlesi_ malaria imported from Southeast Asia. Changing tourism patterns such as the trend towards eco-tourism might increase the risk of infection even in low prevalence areas.

[ProMED-mail thanks Prof Thomas Loescher and colleagues for reporting these 2 cases of _Plasmodium knowlesi_ and alerting us to this emerging infection in the Southeast Asia.

_Plasmodium knowlesi_ is found in all countries in Southeast Asia where there are Macaque monkeys, which are the natural reservoirs.

_P. knowlesi_ was previously classified as _P. malariae_, but with the development of molecular typing of the plasmodia, it became apparent that many malaria infections previously classified as _P. malariae_ were indeed _P. knowlesi_.

Infection with _P. knowlesi_ is dangerous because the life-cycle of the parasite is only 24 hours and the parasitemia therefore increases more rapidly compared to the other malaria species.

So far transmission is from the macaques to humans, and human-to-human transmission has, to our knowledge, not been found. - Mod.EP
