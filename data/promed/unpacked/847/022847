[1] Spain: autochthonous case
Date: 6 Oct 2014

A Spanish nurse has become the 1st person to be infected with Ebola outside of West Africa after contracting the virus while treating a missionary who died in a Madrid hospital, Spain's health ministry said Mon [6 Oct 2014]. The assistant nurse was part of the medical team at Madrid's Carlos III hospital that treated MGV, the missionary, who was repatriated from Sierra Leone but then died in the Madrid hospital on 25 Sep 2014.

Ana Mato, Spain's health minister, told a televised news conference that the nurse tested positive for Ebola twice and that the rest of the 30-person team that looked after the missionary were undergoing medical tests to determine whether they had contracted Ebola.

The nurse, whose name was not disclosed, worked in the Carlos III hospital that had been specially selected and prepared to treat AMP, another Spanish priest who had been working in Africa and was the 1st European to be repatriated after being infected with Ebola. Father P. died on 12 Aug 2014, 5 days after entering the special unit of the Carlos III hospital.

Ms. Mato, the health minister, would not discuss how a staff member could have contracted Ebola while working in a hospital specially equipped to handle such a dangerous virus. "We are trying to determine whether all the health safety protocols have been followed," she said. Ms. Mato urged people to remain calm, adding that "all the possible measures" were being taken to guarantee public health safety.

Antonio Alemany, a health official from the regional government of Madrid, told the news conference that the nurse went on vacation a day after Father GV died. She got in touch with a medical center on 30 Sep 2014, after feeling feverish, but had been leading "a normal life" while on vacation, he added, without giving details on her whereabouts during that period.

Mr. Alemany said the nurse initially showed only "low symptoms" of illness, with a fever of roughly 100 F. He described her current condition as stable, after the Ebola infection was confirmed in 2 separate tests. He would not estimate how many people had contact with the nurse in the past 2 weeks, saying that a complete list was being drawn up. On the list is the nurse's husband, Mr. Alemany said, but she has no children. She is 44, according to the website of El Pais, the Spanish newspaper, which cited unidentified medical sources.

The nurse had direct access to Father GV on 2 occasions, Mr. Alemany said, one of which occurred after his death on 25 Sep 2014. Father GV, 69, had been repatriated 3 days earlier from Sierra Leone. The nurse was kept in isolation in a hospital in Alcorcon, on the outskirts of Madrid, but not in a unit specialized to treat infections like Ebola. She was expected to be transferred to the Carlos III hospital late Monday [6 Oct 2014].

The Liberian man [now] in critical condition in a Dallas hospital with the Ebola virus is being treated with an experimental antiviral drug, Texas officials said Mon [6 Oct 2014]. Candace White, a spokeswoman for Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, said Monday that the patient, D., was receiving the drug, brincidofovir, after the Food and Drug Administration approved its use on an emergency basis.

Brincidofovir, made by Chimerix of Durham, N.C., is taken orally and is being tested against several common viruses...

Ebola patient D.'s passenger health screening form
------------------------------
2 Oct 2014: (Gazettenet) This 2 Oct 2014 photo shows a copy of a passenger health screening form filled out by Ebola patient D., which was obtained by the Associated Press from the Liberia Airport Authority. Liberia plans to prosecute D, who brought Ebola into the U.S., alleging that he lied on a health questionnaire about not having any contact with an infected person, authorities said Thursday, 2 Oct 2014...

[The last few lines read:
In the last 21 days, have you experienced any of the following? Yes No
Have you been stuck with a needle used on an Ebola patient? [He checked No.]
Have you had body fluids of an Ebola patient in your eyes, nose or mouth? [He checked No.]
Have you taken part in a burial or funeral rites, or touched the body of someone who has died in an area where there is Ebola?
[He checked No.]
Did you stay in a house with or have other casual contact with an Ebola patient? [He checked No.]
Have you taken care of an Ebola patient or come into contact with body fluids of an Ebola patient? [He checked No.]
If your answer was yes, did you _always_ use a mask and gloves, and other protection? [He checked N/A (not applicable).]
Have you worked in a laboratory that processes body fluids of confirmed Ebola cases? [He checked No.]
If your answer was yes, did you _always_ use personal protective equipment? [He checked N/A (not applicable).]

[A defense lawyer might argue that he thought the sick woman he helped carry from the house he lived in had a serious case of malaria, and they took her 1st to the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hospital's maternity ward, so that he was truthful when he said he did not contact an Ebola patient, and anyway, he didn't touch her or go to her funeral after she died. - Mod.JW]

Nephew strongly rejected allegations that D. lied
----------------------------------------------------------------
3 Oct 2014: (CNN) Before flying out, D. allegedly answered "no" to questions on a health screening questionnaire about whether he'd cared for anyone with Ebola, or touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease. But Tugbeh Chief Tugbeh, a community leader in Liberia, has said that D was "a caretaker" for a woman who died from Ebola at a residence outside the capital of Monrovia. Because of these and other claims, Liberia Airport Authority officials say they may prosecute D if he lied before leaving that West African nation...

D's nephew on Fri [3 Oct 2014] strongly rejected such allegations, much like other relatives have in recent days. Sitting alongside NG, D.'s mother, in Charlotte, North Carolina, D.'s nephew JW told CNN's Jim Sciutto that D. told him "he had moved a long time ago" from an area hit hard by Ebola. "He said, 'Well, I wasn't even in that area,'" said Weeks in direct response to Tugbeh's claim. "... He wasn't a part of that whole scenario that has been populating the news all these many days. So that's inaccurate."

[3] USA: sick cameraman arrives at Nebraska hospital

An American freelance TV cameraman working for NBC News in West Africa walked off a plane today [6 Oct 2014], waving as he arrived in the USA for treatment after contracting Ebola in Liberia.

AM arrived Monday morning [6 Oct 2014] at the Nebraska Medical Center's special biocontainment unit in Omaha, one of 4 such units in the USA, which are all equipped to handle the most dangerous infectious diseases. Staff at these centers have undergone special training to handle Ebola and other biohazards for the past decade.

The video journalist, 33, reported symptoms on Wed [1 Oct 2014] and was running a slight fever. On Thu [2 Oct 2014], he was tested for the virus at a treatment center, with the result coming back positive, NBC News said in a story posted on its website... [His] parents said they haven't yet decided on the best treatment for their son. "We are assessing all treatment options," [said] Brad Britigan, dean of the college of medicine at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Other Ebola patients treated in the USA have received experimental treatments, one of which is in short supply...

AM had been hired last Tue [1 Oct 2014] as a 2nd cameraman for NBC's medical correspondent, Nancy Snyderman, who is in Liberia reporting on the Ebola epidemic with 3 other NBC News employees... Snyderman and others in her crew will be flown back to the United States on a private charter flight and will be quarantined in the United States for 21 days "in an abundance of caution." http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/06/camerman-ebola-patient/16805529

US journalist believes he got Ebola while cleaning infected car
----------------------------------
6 Oct 2014: (ABC News) The American journalist with Ebola who arrived at a Nebraska hospital today believes that he may have gotten infected when he got splashed while spray-washing a vehicle where someone had died from the disease. AM arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center this morning [6 Oct 2014] after being flown directly from Liberia. "He's strong and his symptoms are not more advanced than when he talked to us before he left, which is a relief," said his father ... at a news conference today. He said his [son] has a fever and slight nausea... Levy said that his son is "not certain" when he got the disease but believes that he could have gotten infected by some of the spray back that came when he was using chlorine [bleach] to disinfect a car. "It was a vehicle that somebody had died in," Levy said... http://abcnews.go.com/Health/us-journalist-ebola-nebraska-treatment/story?id=25987193

[4] Prevention & false alarms

USA: Self-quarantine by missionary family, Arizona
--------------------------------------------------------
Date: 2 Oct 2014 An Arizona man who spent about 2 weeks in Liberia on a religious mission has quarantined himself and his family inside their Payson home, even though he is showing no signs of the Ebola virus. AM returned to the U.S. on Sun [28 Sep 2014]. He was checked for a fever -- as are all passengers -- before leaving Liberia, the African country being hit the hardest by the Ebola outbreak, and he said he is now checking his temperature twice daily. Fever is one of the 1st signs of Ebola. The self-imposed quarantine and twice-daily checks are just 2 of the precautions AM has taken before and after his trip with CrossWay International to distribute sanitation supplies and preach the gospel...
