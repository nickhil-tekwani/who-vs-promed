A flying fox found at Bairnsdale tested positive for a rare but fatal
disease that can be passed to humans.

Health officials have warned Victorians not to handle flying foxes
after one of the animals was discovered carrying a deadly disease that
can be transmitted to humans.

Victoria's chief health officer Dr John Carnie said a dead flying fox
found in Bairnsdale this month [May 2011] tested positive for
Australian bat lyssavirus, a rare but fatal disease that can be passed
to humans.

Domestic pets are also at risk of contracting the disease from the
animals, which often roost in backyard fruit trees.

Dr Carnie said 9 Victorian flying foxes had tested positive for the
virus since 1996. The virus is transmitted by being scratched or
bitten by a flying fox.

He said in the most recent case, the flying fox was not believed to
have infected any humans or pets.

"Although it is known that many flying foxes across Australia carry
the virus, instances of transmission to humans are very rare, with
only 2 cases ever having been recorded, both of which were seen in
Queensland," Dr Carnie said.

"Australian bat lyssavirus is detected from time to time in flying
foxes in Victoria, but no human cases have ever occurred here. The
disease has never occurred in domestic pets in Victoria."

He said only trained volunteers or wildlife workers should handle
flying foxes, and vaccination was recommended for those who regularly
handle the animals.

Dr Carnie said anyone who encountered a sick or injured flying fox
should not attempt to catch it but call the Department of
Sustainability and Environment on 136 186.

A person who was bitten or scratched by a flying fox should wash the
area with soap and water and see a doctor immediately.

There are over 160 species of flying foxes, all belonging to the
genus ) _Pteropus_. These are fruit bats and are so named because they
are thought to have the head and fur resembling a fox. Fascinating and
lovely creatures. There are also some great photos on the original
link to the story.

Lyssavirus is an RNA virus related to rabies virus.

Australian bat lyssavirus (ABL) was first identified in 1996, and has
been found in several species of flying foxes and bats in Australia. 2
human deaths have been reported due to this virus. Both of these
individuals had a history of contact with flying foxes or microbats,
and it is now known that strains of virus from both types of bats
cause disease in humans. This new lyssavirus is closely related to,
but is distinct from, the classic rabies virus. In laboratory animals,
rabies vaccine and rabies immunoglobulin protect against ABL.

Although there has been significant work done on understanding ABL
and its effects, we have much more to learn about this recently
discovered organism. Nevertheless, research on ABL and on rabies and
other related viruses has enabled communicable disease specialists to
develop guidelines on managing actual and possible exposures to this
disease.

The 3 documents available on the website and developed by CDNA in
consultation with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Forestry - Australia with input from a range of people with expertise
in this area provide information relevant to the needs of medical
practitioners, veterinarians, and the general public. "CDNA has
attempted to obtain material that is accurate and up to date, but the
limited amount of experience with ABL means that these documents may
need to be revised as more information becomes available. - Mod.TG]
