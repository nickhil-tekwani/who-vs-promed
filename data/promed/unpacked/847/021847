Polio alert after 2 refugees found with virus
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and WHO are rolling out a massive emergency polio immunisation campaign in Ifo, Hagadera, and Dadaab and within their host communities after 2 confirmed cases of wild poliovirus were reported in the area.

Garissa county coordinator for health Dr Mohamed Abdikadir said 2 young refugee boys from the same family at the Hagadera refugee camp last week [week of 20 May 2013] tested positive for the poliovirus which paralyses its victim's limbs.

"Right now we have 2 confirmed cases, that means in that area you have around 200 people with that virus in their body and those people can also spread it to others. Once that virus is circulating, it can spread like bushfire," he said.

Abdikadir said the immunisation campaign will target children of 15 years and younger and will be done from house to house in the refugee camps while it will be facility based in the host community areas of Dadaab, Fafi, and Habaswein districts.

Dadaab assistant county commissioner Bernard ole Kipury called for thorough screening of refugees streaming into the refugee camps from neighbouring war torn Somalia to prevent the spread of communicable diseases to the Kenyan populace.

In 2006, following a sustained campaign dubbed "Kick Polio out of Kenya" and just as the country was about to receive a certificate from the WHO declaring Kenya a polio free zone, a fresh case was reported at the Dadaab refugee camp.

This latest incident comes days after another polio case was reported in Mogadishu, Somalia, revealing that despite most parts of the world having successfully eradicated the disease from among their population, the virus continues to thrive in some countries at the horn of Africa.

[When this moderator read the newswire above, it sounded like it was referring to the 3 infected cases reported in prior ProMED-mail posts (see Poliomyelitis update (06): Kenya, Somalia, WHO, Pakistan 20130522.1730683, Poliomyelitis update (06): Kenya, Somalia, WHO, Pakistan 20130522.1730683, and Poliomyelitis update (05): Kenya, global 20130518.1721794) where there were reports of WPV1 identified in 2 individuals in the Hagadera refugee camps (one paralytic and one contact), and an earlier case of WPV1 disease in Mogadishu. At that time (29 May 2013), this moderator checked the Polio Eradication Initiative website where information was available as of 22 May 2013. On rechecking this website, it appears that this refers to cases newly identified since 22 May 2013 (see below). - Mod.MPP]

[It looks as though there is ongoing circulation of WPV1 in Somalia with introduction of the virus into the refugee camps in Kenya, which house substantial numbers of Somalian refugees.

If one looks at the history of poliomyelitis in the Horn of Africa in the not too distant past, in 2005 and 2006 there was transmission of the wild poliovirus in the region with initial cases identified in the Sudan, but later on involvement of Yemen, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia. Hence, the prudence of the planned vaccination efforts in the region. One hopes that history will not repeat itself with spread of the WPV to other countries in the region.
