News of the response
Social mobilization
- This Thursday [25 Oct 2018] more than 1000 students from universities and colleges in Beni invaded the city with a peaceful march to show their support for the Ebola response. For nearly 2 hours, students crisscrossed the areas of the city in which pockets of resistance had been recorded to convince the residents of these areas to collaborate with the teams of the response. With this march, the Beni students officially launched the "Ebola Pas Chez Moi" campaign, which invites all citizens of Beni to respect the preventive measures and all the recommendations of the health authorities to stop the spread of the virus.
- The Response Coordinator Dr. Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe found the students at the end point at Kalinda Stadium to congratulate and encourage them in this initiative. He hopes that this involvement of students will help overcome the resistance, sometimes maintained by neighborhood youth in some active homes of the city.

[The dramatic expansion of the Beni ETC capacity is a direct consequence of the actual and anticipated increased number of Ebola cases in the wake of local violence leading to disruptions in contact tracing, ring vaccination, and other control activities in the Beni area. The Beni students are to be congratulated for their "No Ebola here" social mobilization campaign to overcome resistance to Ebola control workers.

[2] Outbreak summary
- 25 Oct 2018. Ebola virus disease - Democratic Republic of the Congo
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs); edited]
http://www.who.int/csr/don/25-october-2018-ebola-drc/en/

Security incidents over the past week, ranging from clashes between rebel and government forces resulting in civilian deaths to response vehicles being pelted with stones, continued to cause community distress and severely impede response activities for the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). These incidents are occurring amid intense EVD transmission in communities in the city of Beni. Despite these challenges, the Ministry of Health (MoH), WHO and partners are reinforcing efforts to contain the outbreak; WHO does not currently plan to reduce the response team, which comprises more than 250 WHO staff.

Since the last Disease Outbreak News (16-23 Oct 2018), 27 new confirmed cases were reported: 24 from Beni (including one resident of Mandima who was hospitalized in Beni) and 3 from Butembo. Of the newly reported cases, 8 were known contacts of previously confirmed cases at the time of reporting, 2 were linked retrospectively to transmission chains, and 17 remain under investigation. A health worker from a community health post in Beni was among the newly infected; 21 health workers have been infected to date, of whom 3 have died.

As of 23 Oct 2018, 247 EVD cases (212 confirmed and 35 probable), including 159 deaths (124 confirmed and 35 probable; note the number of cases is subject to change due to ongoing reclassification, retrospective investigation, and the availability of laboratory results), have been reported in 7 health zones in North Kivu Province and 3 health zones in Ituri Province (see Fig. 1 in the source file). A total of 65 cases have recovered, been discharged from Ebola treatment centres (ETCs) and reintegrated into their communities. Trends in weekly case incidence and the secondary peak observed earlier this month [October 2018] reflect the intensity of transmission in and around Beni (see Fig. 2 in the source file). These trends must be interpreted cautiously given the persistently long delays between illness onset and reporting of cases, as well as the ongoing challenges in investigating this outbreak.

Risk of the outbreak spreading to other provinces in the DRC, as well as to neighbouring countries, remains high with ongoing transmission in communities in North Kivu. Enhanced efforts are needed to ensure areas beyond the main affected health zones are prepared and operationally ready to rapidly detect, investigate and respond to any such exportations of the virus. Over the course of the past week, alerts have been reported from Mauritania, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania. To date, EVD has been ruled out in all these alerts from neighbouring provinces and countries.

Public health response
----------------------
- The MoH continues to strengthen response measures, with support from WHO and partners. Priorities include coordinating the response, surveillance, contact tracing, laboratory capacity, infection prevention and control (IPC) measures, clinical management of patients, vaccination, risk communication and community engagement, psychosocial support, safe and dignified burials (SDBs), cross-border surveillance and preparedness activities in neighbouring provinces and countries.

- Surveillance: As of 23 Oct 2018, more than 11 000 contacts have been registered, of which 5723 remain under surveillance (note the total number of contacts under surveillance is highly dynamic with new cases being registered daily, and those who complete 21 days of post-exposure follow up, without developing symptoms, are released from surveillance). Follow-up rates over the past week ranged from 85% to 97% across all health areas. At present, Beni Health Zone presents the greatest challenges in contact tracing due to a combination of factors, including the unstable security situation. As surveillance activities have been enhanced, responders have seen a significant rise in the number of reported alerts and suspected cases tested each day. During 16-23 Oct 2018, an average of 116 alerts (range, 75 to 159) were reported, of which 35 alerts (range, 7 to 48) were validated as suspected cases for testing each day. Investigations are ongoing for all recently reported cases to elucidate the chains of transmission to interrupt the spread of the virus.

- Vaccination: As of 24 Oct 2018, 122 vaccination rings have been defined, in addition to 37 rings of health and frontline workers. To date, 22 288 eligible and consented people have been vaccinated, including 8471 health and frontline workers and 5488 children. Overall, vaccination teams have reached an additional 3345 eligible and consenting people in the past week.

- Clinical management and IPC: Activities are ongoing in the DRC and are supported by several partners in the field. The ETC managed by the Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA) in Beni has increased its capacity from 41 to 60 beds in the past week.

- Risk communication, community engagement, and social mobilization activities continue to focus on community ownership of the response through engagement with local leaders and influencers, such as community chiefs, religious leaders, and civil society groups, to build community confidence in the response. Community feedback through door-to-door house visits, community dialogue sessions, focus group interviews, and knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surveys is being systematically collected and analyzed to adjust response strategies.

- SDB capacity is provided both by Red Cross (RC) and Civil Protection (CP) teams. RC teams are operational in Mangina, Beni, Butembo (stand-by), Tchomia and Bunia. CP teams are operational in Beni and Oicha. In addition, RC has trained teams in Goma and Mambasa that can be activated as needed. Security remains a challenge in Beni and Butembo, which is negatively SDB interventions. Discussions are ongoing in Beni focused on finding workable solutions to respond in areas where neither RC nor CP teams have access. An additional 6 teams have been trained in Beni and are now operational. As of 23 Oct 2018, 346 SDB alerts were received; of these, 293 (85%) were responded to successfully either by the RRC or CP teams. Response to 40 alerts were unsuccessful due to community refusals or burials conducted prior to the arrival of SDB teams. Among all SDB alerts, 42% were from communities, 30% from ETCs, and 28% from other health facilities (non-ETCs). From 1-24 Oct 2018, 86 alerts were received from Beni and 11 alerts from Butembo.

- Point of Entry (PoE): As of 23 Oct 2018, health screening has been established at 64 PoEs and more than 10.4 million travellers have been screened, with 17 430 means of transport having been decontaminated. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and WHO continue to support the Border Health programme of the MoH in the DRC. As of 23 Oct 2018, 44 of the 64 PoEs were functional due to security incidents, especially in Beni, and a strike by health personnel at PoEs in Ituri Province. With support from IOM, 16 National Program of Hygiene at Borders (PNHF) supervisors will be deployed as of 23 Oct 2018 to North Kivu and Ituri, with the aim of supporting coordination and capacity building at PoEs. IOM-supported population mobility mapping was finalized in Tchomia and Kasenyi, and 5 additional PoEs will be established. IOM also supports 4 PoEs in bordering areas of South Sudan; as of 21 Oct 2018, 9955 individuals have passed through these PoEs. US CDC also supports PoE activities in the DRC and South Sudan.

- Laboratory capacity: Diagnostic testing capability has continued to expand as cases spread to new geographic areas. A total of 5 field Ebola laboratories providing near-patient testing have been established in Beni, Mutembo, Goma, Mangina and Tschomia; these are in addition to the national laboratory in Kinshasa. Testing volumes have increased in the past week; 337 samples were tested in the week ending 21 Oct 2018, which is 30% more than the previous week. Notably, testing of oral swabs from community deaths has increased by 44% and was responsible for detection of one-third of all new confirmed cases in the past week. Testing of deceased persons will be scaled up. Rapid diagnostic testing that can be performed at gravesites is slated for implementation in the testing of corpses to simplify the procedure and decrease tension with families and the community.

- Operational readiness and preparedness: Starting in mid-September 2018, the MoH, with support from WHO and partners, implemented a 30-day plan in 6 high-risk provinces neighbouring North Kivu. Implementation of that plan made substantial progress in establishing and strengthening multisectoral coordination, rapid response teams, surveillance and IPC, contact tracing, PoEs, risk communications and stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE). Building on this success and with a focus on sustained capacity development, the readiness plan has been extended for the next 3 months through the end of January 2019 within the Strategic Response Plan. Tshopo Province and Goma, North Kivu were added to this extension plan. All 3 levels of WHO are working closely with the governments of the 9 neighbouring countries and partners to address major challenges of outbreak management, particularly at the PoE, and with focus on priority 1 countries (Uganda, South Sudan, Burundi and Rwanda). A substantial funding gap remains for the Regional Strategic Plan for EVD preparedness, posing challenges for full-scale implementing.

- Partners: To support the MoH, WHO is working intensively with a wide range of multisectoral and multidisciplinary regional and global partners and stakeholders for EVD response, research and urgent preparedness, including in neighbouring countries. Among the partners are a number of UN agencies and international organizations, including European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operation (ECHO); IOM; UK Public Health Rapid Support Team; United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF); UN High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR); World Bank and regional development banks; World Food Programme (WFP) and UN Humanitarian Air Service (UNHAS); UN mission and UN Department of Safety and Security (UNDSS); Inter-Agency Standing Commission; United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA); and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA); Africa Centres for Disease Control; US CDC; UK Department for International Development (DFID); United States Agency for International Development (USAID); Adeco Federacion (ADECO); Association des femmes pour la nutrition a assisse communautaire (AFNAC); Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA); CARITAS DRC; CARE International; Centre de promotion socio-sanitaire (CEPROSSAN); Cooperazione Internationale (COOPE); Catholic Organization for Relief and Development Aid (CORDAID/PAP-DRC); International Medical Corps; International Rescue Committee (IRC); Intersos - Organizzatione Umanitaria par l'Emergenza (INTERSOS); MEDAIR; Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF); Oxfam International; Red Cross of the Democratic Republic of Congo, with the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); Samaritan's Purse; Save the Children (SCI); Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), Emerging and Dangerous Pathogens Laboratory Network (EDPLN), Emerging Disease Clinical Assessment and Response Network (EDCARN), technical networks and operational partners, and the Emergency Medical Team Initiative (EMT). GOARN partners continue to support the response through deployment for response and readiness activities in non-affected provinces and in neighbouring countries and to different levels of WHO.

WHO risk assessment
----------------------
This outbreak of EVD is affecting northeastern provinces of the country, which borders Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan. Potential risk factors for transmission of EVD at the national and regional levels include transportation links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries; the internal displacement of populations; and the displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries. The country is concurrently experiencing other epidemics (e.g., cholera, vaccine-derived poliomyelitis) and a long-term humanitarian crisis. Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu and Ituri at times limits the implementation of response activities. WHO's risk assessment for the outbreak is currently very high at the national and regional levels; the global risk level remains low. WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel to, and trade with, the DRC based on currently available information.

As the risk of national and regional spread is very high, it is important for neighbouring provinces and countries to enhance surveillance and preparedness activities. The IHR Emergency Committee has advised that failing to intensify these preparedness and surveillance activities would lead to worsening conditions and further spread. WHO will continue to work with neighbouring countries and partners to ensure that health authorities are alerted and are operationally prepared to respond.

WHO advice
-----------
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to the DRC based on the currently available information. WHO continues to closely monitor and, if necessary, verify travel and trade measures in relation to this event. Currently, no country has implemented travel measures that significantly interfere with international travel to and from the DRC. Travellers should seek medical advice before travel and should practice good hygiene.

[3] Vaccination in pregnancy
- Fri 26 Oct 2018. Amid Ebola surge, experts don't give nod to vaccine in pregnancy
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) News, abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/10/amid-ebola-surge-experts-dont-give-nod-vaccine-pregnancy

Ebola vaccine was among the topics that the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunizations discussed this week at its meeting in Geneva. At a media telebriefing today [26 Oct 2018], the group's chair Alejandro Cravioto, MD, with the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the group examined data on using Ebola vaccine in pregnant women. The VSV-EBOV vaccine contains live virus, which typically is not recommended for use in pregnant women. He said health officials are following a small number of women who did not know they were pregnant when they received the VSV-EBOV vaccine and some who were inadvertently vaccinated.

Joachim Hombach, PhD, MPH, executive secretary of SAGE and senior advisor at the European Vaccine Initiative, said the risk-benefit analysis suggests that risk of contracting Ebola is very low for nonvaccinated people -- including pregnant women -- in settings where ring vaccination is underway.

In the months ahead, health officials hope to have more information from detailed follow-up on pregnant women who were vaccinated, officials said, adding that there is not enough evidence for SAGE to make a final conclusion. They added that local ethics committees may also be taking up the issue, based on the situation on the ground.

During their meeting this week, SAGE members also heard status reports on several other Ebola vaccines that are in the development pipeline. Cravioto said the only other vaccine that the group sees being used in the near future is the prime-boost regimen that combines a priming dose of the adenovirus-vectored Ad26.ZEBOV vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson and a booster dose of MVA-BN-Filo from Bavarian Nordic. He said SAGE advisors heard a presentation on phase 2 findings for the vaccine.

Over the past few years, experts have said they see roles for different Ebola vaccine formulations. For example, VSV-EBOV has been useful in outbreak settings because it induces rapid protection, but researchers are exploring vaccines that could provide long-lasting protection for preventive vaccination campaigns, including protecting health workers in outbreak zones.

The vaccines in the Johnson & Johnson regimen are genetically modified so they cannot replicate, which might provide an option that health officials would be more comfortable recommending for pregnant women. Cravioto said it is up to the company to decide the next steps for the clinical trial, but the group suggested including pregnant women.

[Sanctioning the use of the current VSV-EBOV vaccine in pregnant women is being withheld by SAGE pending clinical follow-up of pregnant women who inadvertently received the vaccine. According to SAGE, the risk of contracting Ebola is low in nonvaccinated individuals within a ring vaccination cohort, presumably because of local herd immunity. However, the mortality rate of Ebola in pregnant women and their fetuses is extremely high, and other experts have advocated for including pregnant and lactating women in vaccination campaigns (see Ebola update (79) 20180828.5991478, part [3]). - Mod.LXL
