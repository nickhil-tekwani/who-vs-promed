Ebola disease caused by Sudan ebolavirus -- Uganda
--------------------------------------------------
Description of the outbreak
---------------------------
From when the outbreak was declared on 20 Sep 2022 until 7 Nov 2022, a total of 136 confirmed cases and 53 confirmed deaths (CFR 38.9%) from Ebola disease caused by the Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) have been reported, representing an increase of 18% and 66% respectively since the last DON published on 28 Oct 2022. In addition, 21 probable deaths have been also reported since the beginning of the outbreak, with the last probable death notified on 29 Sep 2022. 3 additional cases and 3 additional deaths have been reported among healthcare workers since 28 Oct 2022, resulting in a total of 18 cases and 7 deaths among these workers.

Since the last DON, one newly affected district has been reported (Masaka), leading to a total of 8 districts reporting cases. The most affected district remains Mubende with 63 (46%) confirmed cases and 29 (55%) confirmed deaths, followed by Kassanda with 46 (34%) confirmed cases and 19 (36%) confirmed deaths. 2 districts, Bunyangabu and Kagadi, have not reported cases for more than 40 days.

As of 7 Nov 2022, a total of 1386 contacts in 7 districts are currently under surveillance, with a follow-up rate of 92%. In the week commencing 31 Oct 2022, an average of 1586 contacts were followed up daily, a decrease of 16% from the previous week (week commencing 24 Oct 2022) when a daily average of 1896 contacts were followed up. A total of 34 contacts developed symptoms during the past week. Since the beginning of the outbreak, 3867 contacts have been registered, of which 2237 (68%) have completed the 21-day follow-up period.

As of 7 Nov 2022, at least 2835 alerts have been received at a daily average of 71 alerts. Approximately 94% (n=2671) of all alerts received were investigated within 24 hours, of which 1120 were validated as suspected cases. The proportion of alerts investigated within 24 hours has been steadily increasing, and in the week commencing 31 Oct 2022, nearly all alerts (657/659) were investigated within 24 hours, of which 31% (n=203) were validated as suspected cases.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 2139 samples were collected (suspects, repeat samples, swabs), of which 419 in the week commencing on 31 Oct 2022 (+11% increase as compared to the previous week when 377 samples were collected and tested).

Public health response
----------------------
For further information on the public health response in Uganda by the Ministry of Health, WHO and partners, see the latest situation reports jointly published by the Ministry of Health and the WHO Regional Office for Africa: https://www.afro.who.int/countries/publications?country=879.

Partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) have deployed staff to support the response activities in Uganda, primarily for case management, infection prevention, and control and WASH, epidemiology and surveillance, laboratory, Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) and Safe and. Dignified Burials (SDBs).

Preparedness and operational readiness in neighboring countries
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in the 6 neighboring countries (Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the United Republic of Tanzania), in-country and international partners, and WHO are supporting SUDV readiness actions. These include the activation of multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms for SUDV; refresher training of rapid response teams; refresher laboratory training; infection prevention and control at health care facilities; activation/strengthening of surveillance systems for SUDV; community engagement and risk communication; screenings at points of entry (PoE) and assessment and reinforcement of case management capacities, among other activities.

Countries are requested to cascade the operational readiness activities to sub-national levels in high-risk districts/states to stop the introduction of SUDV into their communities. A new online preparedness assessment tool has been developed to measure key performance indicators to quantify and document the functionality of preparedness capacities in multiple high-risk districts in Uganda and 6 countries neighboring Uganda to facilitate real-time monitoring of the actual readiness status.

In addition, external stakeholders in these 6 countries will jointly assess preparedness. The Joint Assessment Missions (JAM) will evaluate preparedness at the national level as well as in high-risk subnational-level districts/states. The JAM reports will provide a detailed picture of preparedness capacities in all pillars and in all subnational areas that are at risk.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
On 1 Nov 2022, WHO revised the risk assessment for this event from high to very high at the national level, and from low to high at the regional level, while the risk remained low at the global level.

The estimated very high risk at the national level is based on a combination of several factors including the lack of licensed medical countermeasures; the late detection of the SUDV outbreak and its spread to multiple districts (including to larger cities like Kampala, with a population of more than four million people and travel connections to many neighbouring countries); a highly mobile population with reports of some high-risk contacts and symptomatic cases traveling between districts using public transportation; despite significant case-finding efforts, there is a possibility that some contacts may have been missed; reported challenges with community engagement in affected districts; many cases have presented at various health facilities with suboptimal infection prevention and control (IPC) practices.

Ebola spread to southern district adds to Uganda's challenges
-------------------------------------------------------------
At a World Health Organization (WHO) briefing today [9 Nov 2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said Uganda's government is making progress in its battle against Ebola, but he raised concerns about case detections outside the main hot spots.

Over the past 2 weeks, most cases have been reported from the capital city Kampala, as well as Kassanda district. Tedros said one case has also been reported from Masaka district in the south of the country, which appears to raise the number of affected districts to 8. "The detection of cases in several different districts is clearly concerning," he said.

Tedros said the main focus is strengthening contact tracing, community engagement, and infection prevention.

Uganda's health ministry has reported 136 confirmed cases, along with 53 deaths among patients with confirmed infections. Earlier in the outbreak, which began in September, the country reported 21 suspected cases, all of them fatal.

In other developments, an internal report from Uganda's health ministry, dated 31 Oct 2022, projects that outbreak numbers could rise as high as 1200 cases and 500 deaths by April [2023], sources told the United Kingdom-based Telegraph.

- 8 Nov 2022 Telegraph article: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/ugandas-ebola-outbreak-projected-kill-500-response-repeats-mistakes/. Extracted from the article: "Supply shortages are also significant. Health workers have complained of inadequate PPE, while limited food for those in quarantine means some patients and their contacts have escaped isolation -- spreading the virus.

"Initially the impression was that this was small and under control and would burn out," one source close to the response told the Telegraph. Now the impression is that this is rapidly getting out of control, or is out of control. And a lot of the steps that could be taken to mitigate and respond are not being taken."

"The government's models, shared in a 15 page document dated 31 Oct 2022, were pulled together to inform assumptions about budgets, PPE, and staffing requirements -- including the size of burial teams and amount of medical equipment needed.

"If the epidemic follows the predicted trajectory it would become Uganda's worst, surpassing an outbreak in 2000 when 435 infections and 224 fatalities were recorded. The working assumptions suggest that 53 per cent of cases will be adults."

The report by the Telegraph continues with a very disturbing analysis of all that has gone wrong with the response to this Ebola outbreak. See URL above to read the full article and see the figures. - Mod.LK
