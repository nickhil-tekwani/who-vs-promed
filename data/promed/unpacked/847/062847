A case of cutaneous anthrax was reported in Motupe, a rural district
in Lambayeque province [a coastal area 483 km (300 mi) north of Lima],
informed Dr Carlos Uriarte, head of the Health Region. He pointed out
that the case occurred in Palacios community, 1 km [0.6 mi] away from
Motupe.

The infected patient is a veterinary technician who works for the
National Agricultural Sanitation Service (SENASA, according to its
Spanish initials). He acquired the disease after sacrificing an
infected sheep. The patient received therapy with ciprofloxacin in the
local health center; and he is recovering uneventfully.

DIRESA [Regional Health Directorate by its Spanish initials] decreed
that all cattle in the area must be vaccinated and established
measures for strengthening sanitary surveillance, considering that
there were 6 cases of cutaneous anthrax in 2010.

[While the veterinary technician may have got infected slaughtering
and butchering one of his own animals, it is just as likely that he
was careless while necropsying this sick sheep.

While the Peruvian government may regard this as a sporadic disease
the frequency and consistency of human cases, sometimes in significant
numbers -- 58 in 2005, 31 in 2006 with one death, 25 in 2008 and one
death -- reveals that it is not getting the attention it deserves. It
occurs in 5/10 coastal departments, but over the past decade there
have been livestock cases reported in Ancash, Cajamarca, Pasco,
Huanuco, Ica, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Moquegua, Piura, Tacna,
and Tumbes. The frequent association with human cases indicates that
the disease is being under-reported in livestock, and especially sheep
and goats.
