Cholera - Iraq
--------------
WHO has received notification from the National IHR Focal Point of Iraq of additional laboratory-confirmed cases of cholera. As of 8 Oct 2015, a total of 1263 laboratory-confirmed cases of _Vibrio cholera_ O1 Inaba were reported. These cases were reported from at least 15 governorates of the country. These are Babylon (469 cases), Baghdad (304 cases), Qadisiyyah (146 cases), Muthanna (155 cases), Basra (61 cases), Wassit (41 cases), Karbala (33 case), Najaf (32 cases), Thi-qar (6 cases), Maysan (6 cases), Diyala (2 cases), Duhok (2 cases), Erbil (2 cases), Kirkuk (2 cases), Salah al-din (1 case), and Suleimaniyah (1 case).

Public health response
----------------------
The cholera task force led by the Ministry of Health (MoH) has established a Cholera Command and Control Centre to enhance multisectoral coordination for effective response to the outbreak. In the affected governorates, active surveillance has been stepped up for case findings in the community, and case management has been standardized across all health facilities currently admitting the cholera cases.

In cholera affected areas, and particularly in the camps hosting the internally displaced people and refugees, preparedness activities have been geared up as well. These include distribution of bottled water, water kits, hygiene kits, bleaching powder and chlorine tablets; establishment of water distribution points; sanitation activities, such as disinfecting septic tanks at health facilities, conducting targeted sanitation improvements including for the water treatment plant, as well as regular cleaning of latrines and bathing facilities and proper solid waste collection, disposal and management; and dissemination of key messages on cholera prevention through several networks including social media, national radio channels, SMS messages and door to door campaigns.

Furthermore, discussions are ongoing with the International Coordinating Group to release oral cholera vaccine from the global stock. A risk assessment to identify priority groups for vaccination and a vaccination plan is being developed.

WHO has deployed a team of international experts under the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN) to support MoH respond to this outbreak. Additional requests have also been sent out to the technical partners in GOARN in case of request for additional international support for cholera response.

WHO advice
----------
WHO does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions on any country affected by cholera outbreak.

Medical authorities in Iraq say the number of recorded cases of cholera in the Arab country has climbed to more than 1300, though there have been no new deaths as a result of the waterborne disease.

Director General of Planning and Development at Iraq's Health Ministry Hassan Hadi Baqer told the Arabic-language al-Sumaria satellite television network on [Fri 9 Oct 2015] that 41 new cases have been diagnosed over the past 24 hours, bringing the number of people affected in the current cholera outbreak to 1302.

Baqer added as many as 12 new people have contracted the disease in Baghdad's al-Rusafa district, which lies on the eastern side of the river Tigris, and 7 in Karkh on the western sector of the river. At least 11 new victims are from the southern Iraqi province of Muthanna 8 from the central province city of Diwaniyah, located 130 kilometers (80 miles) south of the capital, and the other 3 come from the city of Najaf.

Iraq's water and sewerage systems are old, while infrastructure development has been stalled by years of violence.

Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has ordered a set of measures aimed at improving hygiene, among them daily water quality tests, distribution of bottled water to families internally displaced due to the conflict, and the installation of additional water purification stations.

Iraq's Education Ministry has also delayed the opening of primary schools to 18 Oct 2015 "to give the Health Ministry the chance to complete precautionary measures in all schools."

The previous registered cholera outbreak in Iraq killed 4 people and infected some 300 others in the northern city of Kirkuk, situated 236 km (147 miles) north of Baghdad, and the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region in 2012. 5 years before that, about 24 people died of the disease and over 4000 cases were confirmed.

Iraq faces regular threats from other water-borne and food-borne diseases such as measles, typhoid fever, hepatitis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever due to poor public services and hygiene, according to the WHO.

[As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _Vibrio cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical Pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
