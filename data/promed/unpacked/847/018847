An outbreak of hemorrhagic fever in Turkey has sickened 133 people
and killed 7 of them so far this year [2007], the Health Ministry
said yesterday [9 Jun 2007].
The number of cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) from
January to May [2007] was 13 percent higher than for the same period
in 2006, the ministry said.
Last year [2006], 27 of the 438 people who contracted the disease
died, Mehmet Ali Torunoglu, acting chief of the ministry's Department
of Communicable Diseases, said yesterday [9 Jun 2007].
"Definitely, there's an outbreak," said Dr Onder Ergonul, an
associate professor at Marmara University and a CCHF expert. A warmer
climate, which Turkey has experienced in recent years, could mean a
larger tick population that could in turn infect more people with the
disease, Ergonul said.
Authorities at the World Health Organization said they did not
believe there was anything unusual about the outbreak at the moment,
since CCHF occurs regularly in Turkey.
Turkey's 1st known outbreak of the disease was in 2002, and the
country has since adopted stronger surveillance systems, which may
account for the increased number of reported cases.
The Health Ministry has used acaracide, a chemical used against
parasites, to reduce the tick population in the Black Sea and Central
Anatolia regions, where more than 90 percent of the cases have been
reported.
The ministry has also worked to minimize agricultural workers' direct
contact with livestock, thus decreasing their chances of exposure to
the disease.

[ProMED thanks Rapporteur Joseph Dudley for submission of a similar report.
It is not clear from this report whether CCHF virus exposure was from
infected farm animals or from viremic blood of infected people. It
would be interesting to know how effective the acaracide treatment
has been in reducing tick populations.
