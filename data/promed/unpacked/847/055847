Chilean authorities confirmed that 43 people in the south of the country are infected with Q fever, caused by bacteria found in cattle, so the government has asked for advice from international experts. Undersecretary of Health, Jaime Burrows, explained that the 43 patients are inhabitants of the regions of Los Lagos and Los Ríos, in southern Chile, and 20 of them were hospitalized. It should be noted that most of the cases are workers in the dairy industry.

Q fever, which is transmitted to humans through contact with animals, has symptoms such as fever, as well as gastrointestinal and respiratory complaints. Because it is the 1st time that an outbreak of this magnitude has occurred in Chile, the Ministry of Health requested assistance from Australian experts to investigate the cases.

Burrows said that "it is working to control the outbreak" and detailed that patients are receiving antimicrobial treatment. "Unfortunately, about 10 percent of patients will develop chronic infection and we are evaluating the protocols to follow them in the long term," he added.

The head of the Livestock Protection Division of the Agricultural and Livestock Service, José Ignacio Gómez, clarified that the bacterium causing the Q fever does not survive the milk pasteurization process. "It is impossible for the milk that is bought and consumed by the population to cause the Q fever," he said.

Q fever, a zoonosis caused by the bacteria _Coxiella burnetii_, is an organism that does not produce symptoms in animals. The disease was initially described in 1937 in Australia as a fever of unknown etiology.

[Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.
