Cambodia: 3rd avian influenza death confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
Cambodia has confirmed its 3rd fatality from avian influenza, with an
8-year-old girl becoming the latest victim to die in the kingdom.
"According to our initial investigations, the girl died from avian
influenza. We have received confirmation from the Pasteur Institute in
Phnom Penh," the Head of the Health Ministry's infectious disease
department, Ly Sovann, told Agence France Presse (AFP).
Ly Sovann said the girl was from the southern province of Kampot bordering
Viet Nam, where 36 deaths have been reported since the end of 2003. 12
people have also died in Thailand from H5N1 virus infection.
The girl died on Thursday [7 Apr 2005] night at Phnom Penh's
privately-funded Kantha Bopha hospital, he said, adding that samples had
been sent abroad for further confirmation that she died of H5N1 virus
infection. He was not immediately able to provide further details.
Cambodia's other 2 victims were also from Kampot province. The 3rd reported
fatality was a 25-year-old woman who died in Viet Nam in January [2005]
after seeking treatment there. The 2nd victim was a 28-year-old man from
the same province who died in March [2005].

Cambodia: 8-year-old girl is 51st victim of avian influenza
-----------------------------------------------
An 8-year-old Cambodian girl has died of avian influenza, the 51st known
victim of the virus since it swept across Asia at the end of 2003. Health
officials said on Sun 10 Apr 2005 that the girl was from the same province
as the 2 other Cambodian victims, Kampot, on the border with Viet Nam,
which has been hit worst by the H5N1 virus, with 36 victims. 12 Thais have
also died of the virus, which the World Health Organization says has the
potential to mutate into a form that could pass easily between humans and
cause a pandemic in which millions of people could die.
The girl died in a Phnom Penh hospital on Thursday [7 Apr 2005] night, and
laboratory tests confirmed she had bird flu the following day, the health
officials said. She probably caught the disease directly from infected
poultry like most of the other victims, they said.
Tens of millions of fowl have died of bird flu or been slaughtered in a so
far vain attempt to kill off the virus, which the WHO says is now endemic
in parts of southeast Asia.

[All 3 human cases of avian influenza virus infection in Cambodia have been
fatal, whereas in Thailand and Viet Nam, approximately half of all
confirmed cases of avian influenza virus infection have survived. This
would suggest that some less severe cases of avian influenza virus
infection in the Cambodian/Viet Nam border region may have gone
unrecognized. - Mod.CP]
