USDA makes nation's largest beef recall
---------------------------------------
The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Sunday [17 Feb 2008]
ordered the recall of 143 million pounds of frozen beef from a
California slaughterhouse -- the subject of an animal-abuse
investigation -- that provided meat to school lunch programs.
Officials said it was the largest beef recall in the United States,
surpassing a 1999 ban of 35 million pounds of ready-to-eat meats. No
illnesses have been linked to the newly recalled meat, and officials
said the health threat was likely small. The recall will affect beef
products dating to 1 Feb 2006 that came from Chino-based
Westland/Hallmark Meat Co., the federal agency said.

Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer said his department has evidence
that Westland did not routinely contact its veterinarian when cattle
became non-ambulatory after passing inspection, violating health
regulations. "Because the cattle did not receive complete and proper
inspection, Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has determined
them to be unfit for human food and the company is conducting a
recall," Schafer said in a statement.

A phone message left for Westland president Steve Mendell was not
immediately returned.

Federal officials suspended operations at Westland/Hallmark after an
undercover Humane Society video surfaced showing crippled and sick
animals being shoved with forklifts.

Two former employees were charged Friday [15 Feb 2008]. Five felony
counts of animal cruelty and 3 misdemeanors were filed against a pen
manager. Three misdemeanor counts -- illegal movement of a
non-ambulatory animal -- were filed against an employee who worked
under that manager. Both were fired. Authorities said the video
showed workers kicking, shocking, and otherwise abusing "downer"
animals that were apparently too sick or injured to walk into the
slaughterhouse. Some animals had water forced down their throats, San
Bernardino County prosecutor Michael Ramos said. No charges have been
filed against Westland, but an investigation by federal authorities continues.

Officials estimate that about 37 million pounds of the recalled beef
went to school programs, but they believe most of the meat probably
has already been eaten. "We don't know how much product is out there
right now. We don't think there is a health hazard, but we do have to
take this action," said Dr. Dick Raymond, USDA Undersecretary for Food Safety.

Most of the beef was sent to distribution centers in bulk packages.
The USDA said it will work with distributors to determine how much
meat remains. Federal regulations call for keeping downed cattle out
of the food supply because they may pose a higher risk of
contamination from _E. coli_, _Salmonella_, or mad cow disease
because they typically wallow in feces and their immune systems are often weak.

About 150 school districts around the nation have stopped using
ground beef from Hallmark Meat Packing Co., which is associated with
Westland. Two fast-food chains, Jack-In-the-Box and In-N-Out, said
they would not use beef from Westland/Hallmark. Jack in the Box, a
San Diego-based company with restaurants in 18 states, told its meat
suppliers not to use Hallmark until further notice, but it was
unclear whether it had used any Hallmark meat. In-N-Out, an
Irvine-based chain, also halted use of the Westland/Hallmark beef.
Other chains such as McDonald's and Burger King said they do not buy
beef from Westland.

Raymond countered a claim leveled by Humane Society President and CEO
Wayne Pacelle, who said a USDA inspector was at the Westland plant
for about 2 hours each day. USDA inspectors are there at
slaughterhouses "continuously," Raymond said. Federal lawmakers on
Thursday [14 Feb 2008] had called for the Government Accountability
Office to investigate the safety of meat in the National School Lunch Program.

Upon learning about the recall, some legislators criticized the USDA,
saying the federal agency should conduct more thorough inspections to
ensure tainted beef doesn't get to the public. "Today marks the
largest beef recall in US history, and it involves the national
school lunch program and other federal food and nutrition programs,"
said US senator Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. "This begs the question: how
much longer will we continue to test our luck with weak enforcement
of federal food safety regulations?"

Advocacy groups also weighed in, noting the problems at Westland
wouldn't have been revealed had it not been for animal right
activists. "On the one hand, I'm glad that the recall is taking
place. On the other, it's somewhat disturbing, given that obviously
much of this food has already been eaten," said Jean Halloran,
director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union. "It's really
closing the barn door after the cows left."

Statement by secretary of agriculture Ed Schafer regarding
Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company 2 year product recall
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Today [17 Feb 2008], USDA is announcing additional actions as a
result of the ongoing investigation at Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing
Company. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has
evidence that Hallmark/Westland did not consistently contact the FSIS
public health veterinarian in situations in which cattle became
non-ambulatory after passing ante-mortem inspection, which is not
compliant with FSIS regulations. Because the cattle did not receive
complete and proper inspection FSIS has determined them to be unfit
for human food and the company is conducting a recall.

The United States enjoys one of the safest food supplies in the
world. To help ensure the safety of the food supply, we implement a
series of safeguards to protect against foodborne disease. These
safeguards include in-plant procedures to reduce dangerous foodborne
pathogens such as _E. coli_ O157:H7 and _Salmonella_. It also
includes the removal of specified risk materials-those tissues
demonstrated to contain the bovine spongiform encephalopathy [BSE]
agent in infected cattle-from the human food chain, along with the US
Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 1997 ruminant to ruminant feed
ban. The prohibition of non-ambulatory cattle from the food supply is
an additional safeguard against bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

Upon notification of possible violations of USDA regulations, we
immediately began an investigation and placed products from this
plant destined for the National School Lunch Program, the Emergency
Food Assistance Program, and the Food Distribution Program on Indian
Reservations on hold. Since then, we also suspended all Federal food
and nutrition program contracts with Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing
Company. To date, Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company remains
suspended by the Food Safety and Inspection Service. The products
destined for the Federal food assistance programs, including the
National School Lunch Program, will now be removed from schools and
other holding facilities and destroyed.

I am dismayed at the in-humane handling of cattle that has resulted
in the violation of food safety regulations at the Hallmark/Westland
Meat Packing Company. It is extremely unlikely that these animals
were at risk for BSE because of the multiple safeguards; however,
this action is necessary because plant procedures violated USDA regulations.

In addition, our Office of the Inspector General and the Food Safety
and Inspection Service continue the investigation. We will respond
immediately if further findings warrant. Details about this recall
and USDA actions are available at <http://www.usda.gov/actions>."

[It all started with an expose of inhumane handling of down cows at a
Chino slaughterhouse:
LA Times 7 Feb 2008

The accounts are horrific.

Logic would suggest that this did not evolve overnight. Having been a
meat inspector for the Canadian government in the mid-60s in Calgary,
Alberta, I know that downers are not rare. I saw my share of them.
They would be down for a variety of reasons, including exhaustion.
The risk they pose is primarily to do with food safety, especially as
they could present problems of incomplete bleeding out and carcass
handling. Today there is the added possibility of one being a BSE
case, though the probability is very low in the US. So I would not be
at all surprised that as the USDA investigates this establishment
they will find accounts of similar events going back months. So far
police have identified in the video 11 instances of alleged illegal
activity between 11 Oct and 9 Nov 2007. It would not be unexpected
that as they dig deeper, more will be found, and the implications
will cause significant additional concerns. When one increases the
size of a denominator, the potential makeup of the numerator can be worrying.

Checking the ProMED-mail archives there are 93 postings on "beef,"
usually ground beef, with a large majority involving _E. coli_
contamination, minority _Salmonella_ contamination, and then concerns
to do with BSE. - Mod MHJ]
