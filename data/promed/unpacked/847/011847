The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) for Rabies stated Thursday [12 Sep 2013] that 4 more Formosan ferret-badgers have tested positive for rabies, bringing the number of confirmed infections to 130 since mid-July [2013], when the 1st case in Taiwan for over 5 decades was reported. 2 of the new confirmed cases were reported in Nantou County's Lugu Township and one each from Nantou's Shueili Township and Taitung County's Guanshan Township, according to the center.

As of a day earlier [11 Sep 2013], a total of 541 wild carnivorous animals had been tested for the infectious disease. Of those, 128 wild Formosan ferret-badgers were found to be infected, CECC data show. The other 2 cases involved an Asian house shrew and a pet dog. There have been no reports of human infection.

The cases were reported in 47 townships and districts in 9 counties and municipalities in central, southern and eastern Taiwan, the CECC said.

The center said it will provide 8500 extra doses of rabies vaccine for use on dogs and cats in ferret-badger-infested areas and another 720 doses to animal shelters. Vaccinations of dogs and cats are continuing across the island, the center said, urging dog and cat owners to get their pets aged over 3 months old vaccinated and not to allow those younger than that to be in contact with wild animals. If pets display erratic behavior such as appetite loss, restlessness or aggression, owners should immediately inform local animal disease control centers, the Center said.

[The number of rabid ferret-badgers continues to rise, but only 2 other animals (a house shrew and a domestic dog) have contracted the disease. So far the CECC has provided no estimate of the ferret-badger population size in Taiwan, making it difficult to put these data in perspective. A more detailed analysis would be welcomed.
