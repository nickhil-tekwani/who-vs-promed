The dwindling population of monk seals in waters around the Hawaiian
islands is being affected by an as yet undiagnosed disease that leaves the
seals blind. Scientists say they've recovered about a dozen female Hawaiian
monk seals from the French Frigate Shoal over the last few years so
afflicted. If a remedy is not found the disease might threaten the entire
monk seal population estimated to be around 1,400.
Scientists working with the National Marine Fisheries Service to repopulate
the endangered seal, are being forced to rethink their present program that
has been relocating the seals to the French Frigate Shoals, where all of
the sick seals have been found. The ailing seals are being housed at Kewalo
Basin where scientists are trying to uncover the source of the disease.
"We know this disease has never been diagnosed or even seen before in monk
seals or in any other species," said Bud Antonelis, chief of protected
species investigation for the fisheries service in Honolulu.
A consortium of scientists is so concerned about the seals they are urging
they [seals or scientists or both? MHJ] be transferred to a world class
aquarium where more in-depth research can be conducted. Sea World of Texas
is requesting the pups be sent to them. They are preparing an application
for a permit to keep the seals.
