Operation Waiheke Media Advisory 2
----------------------------------
Actions related to the claimed release of foot and mouth disease on Waiheke
Island continue. At 5pm yesterday a Controlled Area notice for Waiheke
Island became effective. There are currently 6 veterinarians, 2 specialist
exotic disease investigators, and 3 media liaison staff working on the
island. Checkpoints have been established at the 2 main ferry terminals on
the island and 9 police officers are present to support MAF staff. Efforts
are focusing on the 12 largest properties, as these hold the greatest
numbers of stock and pose the greatest risk of spread.
Last night MAF officials were able to contact 18 of the 39 farmers on
Waiheke Island. Farmers who have not yet been contacted are asked to
contact MAF on 0800 80 99 66. MAF vets will today be making appointments
with Waiheke farmers to observe livestock for possible signs of FMD. All
stock will be checked every 48 hours for 14 days -- the longest possible
incubation period for FMD before clinical symptoms appear.
A public meeting to discuss the situation is planned on the island tonight.
Details of a time and venue will be advised by media notice today.
Overnight, over 50 trading partners, including major member countries of
the EU, have been informed of the situation. Most have expressed
appreciation at the early advice, confidence in New Zealand's management of
the situation, and a desire to be kept informed. Our major trading partners
(US, Canada and the EU) have offered assistance. The World Animal Health
Organisation (OIE) has also been informed and MAF is working with the
farming industry to address their concerns.
Although the claim is believed to be a hoax, it is being taken seriously
and precautionary measures are now in place. Farmers and vets are asked to
be vigilant and keep a close eye on their cattle for signs of disease. MAF
still regards New Zealand as free of FMD.
Pigs are by far the greatest risk of spread, but there are few pigs on
Waiheke Island. Cattle and sheep are a much lower risk -- there are some
2500 cattle and 18 000 sheep on the island.
FMD is an unwanted organism under the Biosecurity Act of 1993. Anyone
convicted of spreading it faces a penalty of up to 5 years' imprisonment or
a fine up to $100 000 [USD 73 000]. Under the Crimes Act anyone convicted
of threatening to commit a crime that would cause major damage to the
economy can be sentenced to 7 years in jail. Section 298A stipulates that
anyone causing disease or sickness to animals can be sentenced to up to 10
years in jail.
MAF wishes to reiterate that this situation is believed to be a hoax, but
must be taken seriously. Anyone with information on the claimed release
should contact their local police station. Given the resources that must be
deployed, both MAF and Police are appealing for anyone with information to
come forward immediately.

[Indeed, NZ officials are taking the letter seriously and taking
appropriate precautionary measures. The updating of the website, the press
releases and their situational reports, clearly indicate that are doing
everything right. We appreciate receiving the official reports and the
situation reports. - Mod.TG]

The New Zealand Government has received a letter claiming that foot and
mouth disease (FMD) virus had been released on an off-shore island on 9 May
and threatening a further release unless the government responded to
demands for taxation changes, and paid a large sum of money. The New
Zealand police are investigating the attempted extortion and are treating
the letter as a hoax.
The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has no reason to
suspect that any release has actually occurred and there is absolutely no
evidence of FMD being present in New Zealand. The island has however been
placed on movement control purely as a prudent precaution, with all animals
being subjected to veterinary monitoring, and tracing is in progress to
confirm no animal movements have occurred.
The New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and Police
investigations have uncovered no evidence or other developments to date
which would indicate this is anything other than a hoax. A full
investigation is under way to find the person responsible, and a measured
disease response is continuing as a precaution.
Waiheke Island has been placed under movement control, and tracing to
determine whether any susceptible animals or risk goods were moved off the
island prior to the implementation of movement control and since 9 May 2005
is almost complete. The New Zealand Food Safety Authority has ascertained
that no slaughtering establishments on mainland New Zealand have received
any animals from Waiheke Island since the start of the claimed risk period.
There are no meat slaughtering establishments on the island. Similarly, the
island has no dairy farms or dairy processing facilities.
Veterinary inspection of all farms on the Island is progressing and will
continue to be undertaken at 48 hour intervals for an anticipated 14 day
period. There is no evidence of the disease being present, or of a release
of FMD virus having occurred.
New Zealand is confident of its continued freedom from FMD and remains
firmly of the opinion that this current investigation is as a result of a
hoax. New Zealand has a well-developed exotic disease response system and
the trained capability to investigate and respond effectively, as will be
evident by our response even in this most unusual situation.

[The incubation time for FMD is short (12-48 hours). The presence or
absence of clinical signs in animals will soon show whether the threat was
a hoax or a real attack. We would see clinical signs in 3 to 5 days (some
estimates are 4-7 days) after yesterday's postulated release and exposure.
I have even seen clinical signs of FMD occur after exposure in less than
the period of time that has now elapsed in this incident. The New Zealand
animal health authorities are to be congratulated for communicating the
nature of the events and forestalling any speculation. - Mod.PC]
