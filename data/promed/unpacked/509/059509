Kenya braces for imminent outbreak of Rift Valley fever
-------------------------------------------------------
Kenyan animal health authorities have issued an alert over an
imminent outbreak of Rift Valley fever [RVF] in the country's North
Eastern region bordering Ethiopia and Somalia. In the alert issued
Thursday [13 Nov 2008] from Garissa, the North Eastern Provincial
capital, 374 kilometres (232.4 mi) from Nairobi, a senior veterinary
officer, Dr Wycliffe Wangwe, said the on-going heavy rains and
warm/humid weather provide the optimal breeding conditions for
mosquitoes, which spread the deadly disease.

Wangwe therefore warned pastoralists in the region to move to high
grounds with their animals and avoid areas with stagnant floodwater
that may host mosquitoes, which are carriers of the viral disease.

He also advised livestock keepers in the region to liaise with the
public health department to acquire [animal] vaccines that may prove
vital in the fight against the disease, which is fatal to both
animals and humans.

Wangwe at the same time asked pastoralists to immediately report
cases of animals displaying symptoms such as hemorrhagic diarrhea,
shivering, abortions, or sudden deaths in both small and large animals.

The official emphasizes that carcasses of animals that have displayed
such symptoms should be buried in a 6-feet-deep (1.8 m) pit,
preferably under the supervision of a veterinary officer where possible.

Movement of animals from areas where the disease has been reported
should also be avoided as it will spread the disease to other areas.

He said the RVF vaccine was available free and welcomed all those who
did not present their animals for vaccination to do so as soon as
their local veterinary office announces the immunization programme.

The viral disease last hit the region in 2006, claiming the lives of
more than 40 people and thousands of animals.

Meanwhile the Ministry of Livestock Development has announced plans
to carry out a mop-up campaign in central rift valley district of
Naivasha for animals that were not vaccinated against the [peste des
petits ruminants] (PPR) disease during a vaccination campaign
exercise, which ended last week [week of 3 Nov 2008].

Naivasha District veterinary officer, Dr Evans Muthuma, said in a
statement Thursday [13 Nov 2008] that the exercise will begin Friday
[14 Nov 2008] and end on 24 Nov [2008].

The vaccination campaign for all shoats (sheep and goats) in Naivasha
District against PPR that ended on 8 Nov [2008] managed to net 122
814 animals in the district.

During the exercise, the animals were also vaccinated against the
Rift Valley fever.

[The application of the (live attenuated) RVF vaccine ahead of the
disease season is commendable. During the previous epizootic, which
started in Garissa in December 2006, vaccination was belated.

Views from experienced animal health workers on the safety and
efficacy of combined application of (live) vaccines against RVF and
PPR will be helpful. - Mod.AS
