Following my posting yesterday, I have had a number of queries about
where to obtain the publication UPDATED GUIDANCE FOR LABORATORY AND
HEALTHCARE WORKERS ON SAFE WORKING WITH TRANSMISSIBLE SPONGIFORM
ENCEPHALOPATHIES, and even some requests for me to supply it.
I have no involvement with DoH or the Stationery Office, and so cannot
supply copies. I merely spotted the news release on the DoH Web page,
and posted it for the information of other list subscribers.
As the DoH press notice said --
"Copies of the new guidance, Transmissible spongiform
encephalopathy agents: safe working and the prevention of infection,
ISBN 0-11-322166-5, are available, price #10, from The Stationery
Office. "
However, for those outside the UK (and some within it) that is not
sufficient information.
I understand that the address for orders by post is -- The Stationery
Office, Publications Centre, P O Box 276, London SW8 2DR. Payment with
order. Cheques should be made out to "The Stationery Office".
PLEASE, no requests to me! [or to ProMED-mail
