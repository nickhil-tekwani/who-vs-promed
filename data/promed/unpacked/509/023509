Kan sees spread of livestock disease as "national crisis," vows efforts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Prime Minister Naoto Kan said Saturday [12 Jun 2010] he considers the
spread of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in Miyazaki Prefecture a
"national crisis" and pledged to do the utmost to contain it from
spreading further as he met with local livestock farmers and top
prefectural government officials in the southwestern Japan prefecture.

Kan told the farmers that the government will do all it can to help
rehabilitate the local livestock industry, saying the government will
take steps to reconstruct their farms in a responsible manner. A
farmer urged Kan to find out what caused the disease to spread and
called on the government to strive to end the epidemic at an early date.

While explaining that it takes several years to rehabilitate livestock
businesses, another farmer called on Kan for government support for
the reconstruction.

In talks with Miyazaki Gov. Hideo Higashikokubaru later in the day,
Kan said he is placing utmost importance on stopping the spread of the
disease and the government will do everything necessary for the
reconstruction of the local livestock industry. Higashikokubaru told
Kan that he wants the state government to shoulder all the expenses to
deal with the disease and to extend full support for the
reconstruction of the livestock and other relevant industries.
The governor said about one-fourth of the livestock in the prefecture
will be slaughtered as a result of the disease.

Also Saturday, the prefectural government said the remaining 5 stud
bulls tested negative for FMD for the 2nd time. The 5 bulls tested
negative last Sunday [6 Jun 2010] in an examination for the presence
of antibodies, conducted by the prefectural government as a
precautionary measure, after they were found uninfected in 2 weeks of
daily DNA tests conducted earlier. The 5, together with another
top-class stud bull, had been separated from other livestock and
placed under supervision following the outbreak of the contagious
disease among livestock in the southwestern prefecture in April
[2010]. The 6th bull tested positive on 21 May 2010 and was slaughtered.

Kan's trip to the prefecture followed new confirmation of livestock
infected with the disease in the cities of Miyakonojo, Hyuga and
Miyazaki since Wednesday [9 Jun 2010].

The days-old government of Kan convened a meeting of its task force
and decided to dispatch additional Self-Defense Forces personnel and
police officers to the prefecture to strengthen disinfection work at
farms and national highways there.

The government has sent Takashi Shinohara, parliamentary secretary for
agriculture, forestry and fisheries, to the prefecture as chief of the
local task force to counter the disease, replacing Masahiko Yamada,
who became farm minister in Tuesday's Cabinet formation. Former Prime
Minister Yukio Hatoyama also visited the prefecture on 1 Jun 2010 in
relation to the disease.

Disease Threatens Japan's Beef Trade
-------------------------------------
It is a calamity for this quiet cattle community. A prized black calf
born last fall will soon be killed, part of the mass destruction of
livestock in Japan's battle against its worst foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) outbreak in at least a century. The epidemic threatens to ravage
the country's trade in prime marbled beef, considered a delicacy in
this country. Miyazaki, on Japan's southernmost main island of Kyushu,
is one of Japan's top beef producers and sends calves to other
cattle-producing regions across the country, including the area that
produces the famed Kobe brand.

"For me, this is the end," said Tsuyoshi Kawasaki, 86, who has raised
cattle in a small hamlet for 60 years. His calf, sired by a legendary
local stud bull named Tadafuji, is not carrying the virus but must be
destroyed because Mr. Kawasaki's barn falls within a 6-mile [10 km]
radius of the outbreak zone.

Two other cows, one pregnant with another Tadafuji calf, have also
been marked for destruction. "They were my livelihood," he said. "If
they weren't, I wouldn't have broken my back to raise them."

Nobody knows how FMD came to Miyazaki Prefecture, home to thousands of
small farms that supply the Japanese gourmet beef market. But the
epidemic of the disease, which causes sometimes fatal fevers and
blisters in livestock but very rarely affects humans [see comment],
has reached critical levels in the region since it surfaced on 20 Apr
2010. The outbreak has come as a blow to a beef industry that has long
prided itself not on volume, but on quality. Brands like Miyazaki or
Kobe beef are sold at a premium, valued for their tenderness, flavor
and a high-fat, marbled texture that results from years of selective
breeding.

Though Japan is a net importer of beef, its exports have jumped more
than tenfold in the last decade, to 4.5 billion yen [USD 49.1445
million] in 2009 from 338 million yen in 2001, fanned by the
popularity of Japanese fare like sukiyaki. High-grade beef can sell
for about 3500 yen, or USD 38, for 3.5 ounces [100 grams] in markets
like the United States and Hong Kong. Japanese beef could soon become
dearer for overseas consumers. The average price in Japan for calves
sold in May jumped 13 percent from a year earlier to 399 000 yen [USD
4357.48], fanned by fears of a shortage.

Throughout Miyazaki this week, roads were dotted with stations staffed
by men in protective suits, spraying cars with disinfectant. Visitors
to public buildings were asked to dip their shoes in pools of
antiseptic.

On Thursday, local officials conducted a new round of culling after 4
new outbreaks of the disease, including one in Miyakonojo, Japan's
largest producer of pork and beef in south Miyazaki. About 20 000
cattle have been culled in the wider Miyazaki Prefecture, and 14 250
more will be destroyed within days, the Health [rather Agriculture?]
Ministry said.

In Tokyo on Thursday, Prime Minister Naoto Kan called an emergency
meeting of agriculture officials to discuss responses at the state
level. "We have reached a critical point, a perilous point," he said.
The government is preparing emergency funding of 100 billion yen,
about USD 1.1 billion, to stem the outbreak and support affected
farmers and Mr. Kan is scheduled to visit Miyazaki on Saturday [see
item 1 above].

The industry is a lucrative one for Japan's small and mid-size
farmers. Mr. Kawasaki says he buys semen from top bulls for about 9600
yen, or about USD 105, and later sells the calves for almost 500 000
yen (USD 5450). "The FMD outbreak struck just as we started to
promote the Miyazaki brand overseas," said Shusuke Iwasaki, an
agricultural supervisor at Miyazaki Prefecture. The region's efforts
have been especially focused on protecting its "superstuds" -- bulls
that have been carefully selected to produce calves with the optimal
fattiness. The studs, picked by local agricultural officials in a
multi-year selection process, are monitored for the quality of meat
from their offspring. Only one or 2 bulls out of the nearly 39 000
bulls born in the prefecture each year eventually attain superstud
status. Tadafuji, the best superstud in recent memory, sired 220 000
calves, local officials say.

Miyazaki authorities decided last month to evacuate the prefecture's 6
superstuds to a farm deep in the mountains. But it was too late: the
7-year-old Tadafuji already showed signs of the disease and was
killed, to the horror of the region's farmers. Tadafuji's death cast a
shadow over the fate of the 5 remaining superstuds, which had shared a
cow shed. One of the prefecture's 49 junior studs soon also showed
signs of the disease. Local farmers begged the government to keep the
studs alive, gathering 6000 signatures and declaring that killing the
junior studs would cripple cattle breeding in Miyazaki.

The 5 superstuds were declared free of disease and spared destruction.
But the 49 junior studs were killed on 31 May 2010, wiping out an
entire generation of top Miyazaki bulls. "My mind went blank; I
thought that was the end of road for Miyazaki's cattle," said Masanori
Aratake, an adviser at the Miyazaki Prefecture Livestock Association,
which helps run the region's breeding program.

It is the 2nd time Miyazaki has been hit by FMD, which Japanese
farmers once boasted would never afflict the country. Before a much
smaller outbreak in 2000, Japan had not seen the disease for 92 years.
Some experts say that Japanese cattle farming methods -- which include
keeping animals in small indoor pens -- may have contributed to the
disease's spread. Local authorities have struggled to find enough land
in cramped Japan to bury the carcasses of culled cattle, slowing down
the process and putting healthy herds at risk.

Experts also say the practice of allowing entire populations to be
sired by a handful of studs could be risky. "There's a debate over
whether we should be more open to mixing our herd with cattle from
other parts of Japan" to produce sturdier livestock, said Reiji Sato,
a local veterinarian.

Meanwhile, Kobe is scrambling to makes sure the outbreak does not
reach its celebrated herd, 280 miles away on Japan's main island of
Honshu. Kobe has dispersed its top bulls to reduce the chances of all
the studs getting sick, said Kenichiro Tominaga, head of livestock
research at the region's center for livestock technology. Kobe has
also stocked up on 2 month's worth of frozen stud semen, Mr. Tominaga
said.

Miyazaki is now intent on saving its youngest generation of studs. In
mid-May, a group of 18 young bulls was evacuated to Takachiho, in
Miyazaki Prefecture's northernmost corner. The remote area holds a
special place in Miyazaki's beef industry: Yasuhira, the bull that
sired the champion stud Tadafuji, was raised there. A life-size
replica of Yasuhira graces Takachiho's newest beef restaurant, while
bumper stickers declare Takachiho "No. 1 in Japan" for beef. "We're
determined to protect these bulls. We're doing everything to shut out
the disease," said Shingo Uchikura, Takachiho's mayor. "It's a battle
against an invisible enemy."

[Even the statement about FMD "very rarely affecting humans" is an
overstatement. Recorded infections in humans are refractory and
extremely rare, in fact limited to laboratory workers. For example,
during the major FMD epizootic in the UK in 2001, when more than 2000
premises were declared infected, not a single human case was confirmed.

The publication of an article on the Japanese FMD outbreak in the New
York Times is indicative of the growing interest in this major
epizootic, its economic impact and the control measures applied,
beyond Japan. - Mod.AS]

Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) Japan 2010
----------------------------------------
The European Livestock Association (ELA) is aiming toward enduring
systems of animal husbandry. It has some well-known scientists
specialised in Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) among their members.

In relation to the FMD measures taken in Japan, the ELA members feel
it is urgent to state the following:
- The statement of the Japanese Authorities that FMD cannot be
eradicated by vaccination is incorrect.
- It would be most unfortunate if Japan repeated the mistakes made in
the management of control of FMD in the United Kingdom and in the
Netherlands in 2001 and if Japan would suffer similar economic and
social consequences for the livestock industry and the wider rural
community.

The main objective of the Japanese authorities is to stop the spread
of disease, bring the epidemic under control and return to an FMD-free
status as quickly as possible.

ELA strongly advises giving careful consideration to the following
questions and answers:

Can the above objective be achieved?
Answer: By stamping out/vaccinate-to-kill. Yes, however -- like in the
UK -- that only becomes successful when susceptible hosts are (almost)
no more available.

The disadvantages of this policy include:
- the considerable numbers of animals slaughtered in order to 'kill'
the virus and stop its spread;
- the socio-economic and practical implications;
- the welfare problems in humans and animals caused by widespread slaughter;
- the impossibility of ensuring accurate diagnosis when the emphasis
is on slaughter;
- the impossibility of maintaining bio-security (shortage of
veterinary surgeons, slaughter teams -- and occasional
non-co-operative/rogue livestock owners and dealers);
- the loss of valuable genetic lines etc.;
- the ethical problem in accepting the destruction of livestock that
are perfectly safe to eat.

Are there more effective alternatives?

Yes. Vaccination to live should replace stamping out/vaccination to
slaughter, in combination with:

- tracing the disease as fast as possible by using newer diagnostic
tests with which one can quickly confirm infection, even in the
prodromal/preclinical phase, giving almost immediate assurance;
- immediate slaughter of animals on infected premises;
- utilising ring vaccination (from uninfected areas centrally toward
the areas where there is the confirmed infection);
- even if animals incubating FMDV or animals with FMD are
inadvertently vaccinated, they will subsequently shed less virus; an
obvious advantage of vaccination.
- maintaining bio-security on farms and a ban on animal transport.

In consideration of the above we would like to advise the following:

- the size of the vaccination zones should not be based on a generic
contingency plan, but must be estimated according to the type of
outbreak: e.g., a multiple loci situation because FMD was initially
unrecognised, (like the UK FMD epidemic of 2001), versus a single FMD
locus that was quickly identified, (like the UK FMD outbreak of 2007).
In the 1st case the zones must be large, in the last case the zones
can be kept relatively small;
- to apply modern purified high potency emergency vaccines that are
very effective and provide protective immunity in a matter of days;
- after vaccination, to differentiate infected animals from vaccinated
animals (DIVA strategy), by serological screening of vaccinated farms
using the appropriate tests.

We hope to contribute to a better way of animal health control,
appropriate to the scientifically advanced tools of the 21st Century,
both for the well-being of the rural societies and their livestock
that serve humanity so well.

We wish [the Japanese authorities] every success in bringing the
outbreaks rapidly under control.
