The official notification, dated 4 Sep 2014, says that Q-fever has been confirmed in sheep flocks (no numbers given) on 26 and 28 Aug 2014.

To prevent human infection:
1. Owners of ruminants in the region described and shown on the map have to notify the authorities about numbers and movement of animals.
2. Movements of susceptible animals are prohibited unless the authorities have issued permits.
3. Owners have to present their animals for compulsory vaccination ('Coxevac'), schedule of vaccination as instructed by manufacturer; antibiotic treatment of clinically normal animals is strongly discouraged.
4. Female animals have to be kept separate from males until at least 14 days after booster vaccination.
5. No visitors unless by prior arrangement and they have to be informed about the potential risk.
6. Protective clothing.
7. Lambing pens can only be accessed wearing protective clothing and disinfectants have to be provided.
8. Shoes/boots have to be cleaned and disinfected (with approved disinfectant).
9. Lambing/calving only in dedicated pens, separated from other animals, indoors and at a minimum distance of 500 m from human dwellings.
10. Ewes/cows with their offspring or ewes/calves after having aborted have to be kept confined and can be moved the earliest 14 days after parturition. Pens have to be disinfected immediately after removal of animals.
11. Afterbirths or aborted lambs/calves have to be collected and should be stored in leak-proof containers until collection.
12. Close contact between humans and ruminants should be avoided; in particular, animal caretakers should be extremely careful when attending animals during parturition and when activities are related to dust production.
13. Treatment of dung/muck: disinfection, storage under plastic wrap for a minimum of 3 months, and then to be spread/ploughed only on wet and quiet (not windy) days.
14. Excessive ("above normal") abortions should be immediately reported to the competent authorities.
15. Sheep have to be treated against ticks every 6 months on veterinary advice.
16. Shearing of sheep should be done only in closed buildings, distant from residential areas.
17. The wool has to be packed and either treated (fumigated?) or destroyed.

Owners have to comply with regulations and are required to cooperate.

[In a recent posting (20141006.2828583) we reported that, according to OIE data, no Q fever vaccination is applied in Germany. It appears that the information from Germany in WAHID (World Animal Health Information Database Interface) is incomplete (reports for the period January 2005-June 2013 visited; later reports, for terrestrial animals, not yet available). Is there no federal database, collecting information about the status of Q fever vaccination in animals throughout Germany?

As indicated at the official notification above, vaccination with the approved vaccine "Coxevac" has become compulsory for all ruminants in the zone established in Bad-Duerkheim; a map is included at the source URL above.

The situation in the various "laender" (states) of the German federation, in relation to Q fever vaccination, deserves to be clarified. Is there a uniform prevention (including vaccination) and control policy?

Details on the vaccine mentioned are available at http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/EPAR_-_Product_Information/veterinary/000155/WC500097773.pdf (thanks to Sabine Zentis for this source). The manufacturer provides instructions for its application in cattle and goats; the vaccine has not been licensed for sheep. To overcome this, the authorities in Bad-Duerkheim included, in their official notification, the following comment: "for the vaccination of sheep, the manufacturer's instructions for the vaccination of goats should be followed". - Mod.AS
