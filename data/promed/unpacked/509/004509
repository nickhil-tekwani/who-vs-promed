On 11 Jun 2019, the Ministry of Health of Uganda declared the 6th outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the country affecting Kasese district in South Western Uganda. The 1st case was a 5-year-old child with a recent history of travel to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This child was one of 6 people that escaped from the DRC while still being monitored as suspect cases following a burial of the grandfather who succumbed to EVD. The child was ill by the time he crossed into Uganda and the mother took him for medical care at Kagando hospital in Kasese district with symptoms of vomiting blood, bloody diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain. The child tested positive for Ebola Zaire by PCR and he later died on [11 Jun 2019]. 2 other members of the family, a grandmother and 3-year-old brother also tested positive for Ebola on 12 Jun 2019 and died later the same day [12 Jun 2019]. Today, the 3-year-old confirmed case and his mother (asymptomatic) were returned to the DRC for further management together with 3 other family members including the father, house help, and an 8-month-old brother. As of today, there is no confirmed case in Uganda, however 4 suspected cases have been admitted at Bwera Ebola treatment unit. 98 contacts have been line listed for follow up so far.

On 11 Jun 2019, the Minister of Health, Hon Dr Jane Aceng, made an official statement of an Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Kasese district, South West Uganda.

The index case was a 5-year-old male who travelled from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with his mother on 9 Jun 2019 after attending a burial of the grandfather who had succumbed to EVD. The grandfather was a pastor who lived in Mabalako health zone in Aloya health area about 30 km from Beni [North Kivu].

The mother was of Congolese origin but married to a Ugandan and residing in Kasese district. However, she had travelled back to DRC to nurse her father who succumbed to Ebola. The health authorities in Beni identified 12 suspect cases from the same family and put them in isolation for monitoring. However, 6 of the 12 suspect cases escaped and crossed over to Uganda. Of the 6 who crossed to Uganda 4 were children and 2 adults with 81 contacts in Kasindi and 40 contacts in Mutwanga, [North Kivu] areas bordering Uganda in the DRC.

One of the people who crossed over was the wife of the deceased pastor -- grandmother to the index case. 3 of people who crossed were of Congolese origin.

The child and his family entered the country through the market at Mpondwe bypassing the official border post. On [10 Jun 2019], the mother sought medical care for the child at Kagando hospital as the child was not feeling well by the time they came into Uganda. The child presented with the following symptoms; vomiting blood, bloody diarrhea, muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and abdominal pain. On suspicion of EVD, the clinicians transferred him to Bwera ETU [Ebola treatment unit] where a sample was collected and shipped to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) on [10 Jun 2019] for confirmatory testing. The grandmother and 3-year-old brother who had also started showing signs of EVD were isolated at the same ETU and their samples collected on the 11 Jun 2019. The 5-year old's results were confirmed positive for Ebola Zaire by PCR on the evening of 11 Jun 2019 and he later succumbed to EVD at about 9.45 pm.

Today [12 Jun 2019], the samples of the 50-year-old grandmother and 3-year-old brother to the index case tested positive for Ebola Zaire by PCR. The grandmother has also succumbed to EVD. 27 contacts have been line listed for follow up so far.

- Thu 13 Jun 2019. Congo pastor likely sparked Ebola outbreak spread to Uganda
[Associated Press (AP), abridged, edited]
https://www.cp24.com/world/congo-pastor-likely-sparked-ebola-outbreak-spread-to-uganda-1.4464362
[Byline: Rodney Muhumuza, Jamey Keaten]


The Congolese pastor who is thought to have caused the Ebola outbreak's spread into Uganda was unknown to health officials before he died of the disease, the World Health Organization's emergencies chief said [Thu 13 Jun 2019]. That underlines the problems in tracking the virus as a WHO expert panel on [Fri 14 Jun 2019] discusses whether to declare a global health emergency.

As a 3rd relative of the pastor found infected in Uganda died, Dr Mike Ryan told The Associated Press he did not believe the man had been on any list of high-risk Ebola contacts that health workers use to track infections and contain the outbreak.

The 3 family members became infected with Ebola when they travelled from Uganda to Congo to visit him. His 5-year-old grandson became the 1st Ebola case in Uganda and the 1st death after several family members quietly returned home on footpaths that bypassed border screening for the disease. The boy's grandmother and 3-year-old brother have since died, health officials said [Thu 13 Jun 2019].

"It's an unfortunate occurrence that a pastor who's taking care of people and providing care to people is himself infected in the line of his own work and then ultimately goes on to infect others," Ryan said.

The pastor's positive test for Ebola came back only after he was buried, Dr Dominique Kabongo, coordinator of Ebola response teams in Kasindi, told the AP. Family members traditionally wash and dress the corpse.

More than 80 people attended the burial, Kabongo said.

The 1st cross-border cases in this Ebola outbreak -- the 2nd-deadliest in history -- have prompted the WHO expert committee to again consider declaring a global health emergency after twice deciding against it. Such declarations almost always boost attention and donor funding.

Ryan said there is no evidence Ebola is spreading within Uganda and that authorities have contained the virus to the family. He said 27 people who may have been exposed are being followed. Ugandan authorities said 3 suspected Ebola cases not related to the family were awaiting test results.

For months, officials have feared the virus would cross the heavily travelled border where health workers have been screening millions of people for fever and other symptoms. Uganda, Rwanda, and South Sudan have been preparing for possible cases.

Uganda's health ministry on [Thu 13 Jun 2019] said it no longer had any confirmed Ebola cases after all members of the Congolese-Ugandan family, including the parents and a 6-month-old baby, were sent to Congo for monitoring and experimental treatments as part of clinical trials.

The family's case shows the challenges in tracking those infected in an outbreak where an alarmingly high percentage of cases aren't discovered until it is too late. Doctors Without Borders last month [May 2019] said as few as 1/3 of new confirmed Ebola cases were linked back to known contacts of infected people.

Ryan, the WHO's emergencies chief, told the AP that about 55% of new Ebola cases in Congo last week [week of 3 Jun 2019] were previously identified as potential contacts, suggesting significant problems remain. Many people are still dying at home instead of seeking treatment, and their burials put loved ones at risk of infection.

Authorities in Congo and Uganda have vowed to step up border security after several members of the family, already showing symptoms of Ebola, were stopped at a Congolese border post but later slipped away and into Uganda. 5 family members who stayed in Congo have tested positive for Ebola, Congo's health ministry said.

Health teams in Uganda "are not panicking," Henry Mwebesa, the national director of health services, told the AP on Wed 12 Jun 2019. He cited the East African nation's experience battling previous outbreaks of Ebola and other hemorrhagic fevers.

For the 1st time an experimental but effective Ebola vaccine is being widely used, with more than 132 000 in Congo receiving it. Uganda is more stable than eastern Congo, and it has vaccinated nearly 4700 health workers. WHO is shipping another 3500 doses this week for health workers and contacts of those infected.

- Thu 13 Jun 2019. Three suspected Ebola victims escape from Kanungu (Uganda) isolation
[Daily Monitor, abridged, edited]
https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Three-suspected-Ebola-victims-escape-Kanungu-isolation-centre/688334-5155380-6atmb0/index.html


Three suspected Ebola victims have escaped from the isolation centre at Kihihi Health Centre IV in Kihihi town council in Kanungu district in western Uganda. The 3 were admitted in isolation when they presented with Ebola like symptoms shortly after arriving at Munyaga border crossing in Western ward in Butogota town council in Kanungu district from DRC on Wednesday morning [12 Jun 2019].

The trio presented with high temperatures, one of the signs of the haemorrhagic fever forcing Ebola surveillance officials to rush them to Kihihi health centre IV for monitoring.

However, the Kanungu Health Inspector, Kato Besisira, says the trio escaped as the health workers were preparing to draw blood samples from them and rush them to Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) Entebbe for examination.

They are suspected to have crossed back to DRC using the porous borders. Besisira says the escape of the trio has triggered panic in the district.

[The rapidly unfolding story of how one family brought Ebola over the border from the DRC to Uganda unfortunately exemplifies many of the contact tracing and containment issues that have confounded attempts to control the outbreak in the DRC:
- As described by WHO official Dr Mike Ryan, the index case of the family's grandfather, a Congolese pastor, became ill and died in the community, and the diagnosis of Ebola was only confirmed post-mortem. He had thus not previously encountered Ebola healthcare workers and was among the 50% or more of emerging cases that were not on known contact lists.
- More than 80 people attended this man's burial, at high risk of exposure, resulting in 27 people (presumably including the index family members) being followed by health workers.
- As described in recent ProMED posts, 12 out of 14 family members were ill and recognized as suspect Ebola cases when they reached the DRC-Uganda border at Kasindi, and were pending transfer to a DRC Ebola treatment centre, when 6 family members escaped and crossed in Uganda, reaching Kasese town before they were discovered and brought to the Byeri, Uganda Ebola unit. 2 family members died there, while the rest of the family were eventually transferred to a Congolese ETC.
- Meanwhile, as reported by the Daily Monitor, 3 non-family members entered Uganda at a different border crossing far south of Kasindi, and presumably these are the 3 suspect cases from the index case's burial mentioned in the AP report above. They were brought to the Kihihi health centre, but then they escaped. Whereabouts unknown, but presumably back to the DRC.
Evading monitoring and treatment clearly leads to additional cases in the broader community, and the question must be raised as to whether and how stronger containment methods are needed to isolate highly suspect and indeed confirmed cases of Ebola.

[2] Outbreak summaries
- Thu 13 Jun 2019. Ebola outbreak in DRC, Uganda tops 2100 cases
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/ebola-outbreak-drc-uganda-tops-2100-cases
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]


The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) confirmed 21 more Ebola cases today [13 Jun 2019], which will raise the outbreak total to 2108 cases in a 10-month-long crisis that now includes 3 cases in neighboring Uganda.

Included in today's tally are 5 repatriated Congolese patients who were identified in Uganda earlier this week, when a 5-year-old boy became the 1st person in Uganda to be diagnosed as having Ebola during this outbreak. The boy died [11 Jun 2019] from the disease, as has his grandmother.

An infection in his 3-year-old brother brings the cluster to 8 cases, all of which are now classified as cases in Mabalako health zone [North Kivu] by DRC health officials.

The boy -- whose grandfather died of Ebola in Mabalako -- and several members of his family were identified at border crossings between the 2 countries and initially seen and treated in Kasese, Uganda, about 140 kilometers (85 miles) from Beni, DRC.

The DRC today [13 Jun 2019] also confirmed 6 new Ebola deaths, bringing the outbreak fatality total to 1411. Officials are tracking 335 suspected cases.

UNICEF response
---------------
Today [13 Jun 2019] UNICEF announced the launch of an emergency response plan in Uganda, which will cost USD 3.9 million and focus on communication, education, and sanitation.

"As our thoughts are with this young boy's family, this is a tragic reminder that even one case of Ebola is one too many," said UNICEF Representative in Uganda, Doreen Mulenga, MD in a press release.

"We must do everything possible to stop this outbreak in its tracks and prevent other needless deaths. UNICEF is intensifying its efforts to do so and minimize this outbreak's potentially devastating impact on children and communities at-large in Uganda."

Uganda confirms 3 cases, with 1 suspected
-----------------------------------------
According to the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Uganda office, there are 3 confirmed cases of Ebola in that country and one suspected case --involving a 23-year-old man. The confirmed cases are the index patient, his grandmother, and the boy's brother, who is being treated.

Officials are following 27 case contacts and will administer 400 donated doses of rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in a ring vaccination effort around the case contacts. The DRC donated the vaccine to Ugandan health officials, and the ring vaccination campaign is expected to start tomorrow [14 Jun 2019].

For months, Ugandan officials have prepared for an Ebola patient crossing into the country. Throughout the week, leaders have taken to Twitter to reaffirm their country's ability to handle the outbreak.

"We appeal to the public and malicious individuals to desist from spreading false rumors about the Ebola outbreak generally and on social media," said Jane Ruth Aceng, MD, Uganda's minister of health in a statement posted to Twitter. "The outbreak is REAL and we urge all residents of Uganda to remain vigilant."

Three more health workers infected in DRC
-----------------------------------------
Today [13 Jun 2019] the DRC's health ministry confirmed that one of the new cases involves a vaccinated health worker in Mabalako.

Yesterday the ministry confirmed that 2 of 13 newly recorded cases were in unvaccinated health workers in Mabalako. One of those health workers died in in the health center where he was working, which officials consider a community death.

There are now 116 health workers infected during this outbreak, including 38 deaths.

DRC officials today said ring vaccination in their country continues, with 133 328 people so far vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed vaccine.

WHO experts to meet tomorrow
----------------------------
Tomorrow [14 Jun 2019] the WHO's Ebola emergency committee will meet to discuss the new cases in Uganda and assess if the situation now warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under International Health Regulations. The group declined to designate the outbreak a PHEIC in 2 previous meetings.

Also today, the European Union (EU) announced an additional funding package of Euro 3.5 million (USD 3.95 million), of which Euro 2.5 million (USD 2.82 million) is for Uganda and Euro 1 million (USD 1.13 million) for South Sudan. This is in addition to the Euro 17 million (USD19.16 million) the EU has already given to the DRC since 2018.

"Our funding is helping with surveillance, work with local communities, and boosting local capacities for these countries to take timely and effective action. We are committed to continue our assistance to bring this outbreak to an end, for as long as it takes," said Christos Stylianides, the commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis management and EU Ebola, in a press release.

- Thu 13 Jun 2019 WHO: Disease Outbreak News - Uganda
[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/13-june-2019-ebola-uganda/en/


On 11 Jun 2019, the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MoH) has confirmed a case of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in Kasese district, Uganda. The patient is a 5-year-old child from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who travelled with his family from Mabalako Health Zone in DRC after attending, on 1 Jun 2019, the funeral of his grandfather (confirmed EVD case on 2 Jun 2019). On 10 Jun 2019, the child and the family entered the country through Bwera border post and sought medical care at Kagando hospital where health workers identified Ebola as a possible cause of illness. The child was transferred to Bwera Ebola treatment unit (ETU) for management. The confirmation of Ebola virus was made on 11 Jun 2019 at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), and the child has deceased in the early hours of 12 Jun 2019. 2 other suspected cases, a 50-year-old female (grandmother of the 1st case) and 3-year-old male (younger brother of the 1st case) part of the family members who travelled together with the 1syt confirmed child were also admitted in the same ETU and were confirmed for EVD by UVRI on 12 Jun 2019. The 50 year-old-female died during the night between 12 and 13 Jun 2019. 27 other contacts have been identified and are being monitored. Healthcare workers from both health care facilities where the child was treated have been previously vaccinated.

Public health response
----------------------
- Since 7 Nov 2018, as part of the preparedness activities, Uganda has vaccinated health and frontline workers in areas at risk of expansion of the outbreak. To date, 4699 health care and frontline workers from 165 health facilities have been vaccinated.
- The MoH and WHO have dispatched a Rapid Response Team to Kasese to identify other people who may be at risk, and ensure they are monitored and provided with care if they become ill.
- 9 Ebola treatment units (ETU) are in place in the districts bordering North Kivu and Ituri. The MoH is setting up more units in the affected district and at referral hospitals to handle cases if they occur.
- The MoH is intensifying community education, psychosocial support and will undertake vaccination for those who have come in contact with the patient and at-risk health workers who were not previously vaccinated.
- Disease monitoring has been intensified at border posts, health centres and communities, and health workers are being trained on recognizing symptoms of the disease. The district administration and local councils in the affected area have been directed to ensure that any person with Ebola signs and symptoms in the community is reported to the health workers immediately and provided with advice and testing.
- WHO is also supporting the Ministry of Health in terms of: finalization of the response plan; operational and logistics support including immediate shipment of vaccines and therapeutics; resource mobilization; deployment of experts on infection prevention and control (IPE), therapeutics, risk communication and community engagement (RCCE), and vaccination; compliance to SAGE [Strategic Advisory Group of Experts] Ebola vaccination protocol and monitored emergency use of unregistered and investigational interventions (MEURI) for Ebola virus disease framework for therapeutics

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
All 3 confirmed cases are imported from DRC and belong to the same family who travelled together from Mabalako health zone, an area currently affected by Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, DRC. To date, they remain as a single episode of EVD in Uganda, and the geographical spread in Uganda appears to be limited to one district near DRC border. Further investigations are ongoing both in Uganda and DRC to assess the full extent of the outbreak.

Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak in DRC in August 2018, WHO has advised neighbouring countries (Priority 1 countries: Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Burundi / Priority 2 countries: Angola, Zambia, Tanzania, Central African Republic, and Republic of Congo) to reinforce their preparedness measures.

Considering that to date i) the EVD cases confirmed in Uganda were epidemiologically linked to the DRC; ii) all 3 cases belong to single family cluster with a common high-risk exposure to a confirmed case; iii) the level of preparedness and the proven experience of Ugandan authorities to manage previous EVD outbreaks; and iv) the rapidity of the detection and a limited geographical area affected (Kasese district), the overall level of risk at national level is assessed as moderate. Moreover, given that there is no evidence of local transmission of EVD in Uganda and the location of the outbreak being close to the DRC border, the overall risk posed at regional level by the Ugandan outbreak is considered low. However, the overall regional risk posed by the outbreak in DRC remains very high. The overall risk at international level remains low.

The Director-General will convene a 3rd meeting of the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) following the most recent risk assessment which noted a cross-border spread of Ebola from DRC to Uganda. WHO has convened the emergency committee under International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) twice (October 2018 and April 2019) since the outbreak in DRC was announced in August [2018]. The committee will discuss whether the event constitute a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises against any restriction of travel and trade to Uganda based on the currently available information. WHO continues to monitor travel and trade measures in relation to this event, and currently there are no restrictions of the international traffic in place.

[Although the case reports are redundant, this summary lays out the current WHO position in Uganda, including its judgment that the level of risk at the national level is currently moderate. Since there is no evidence of local transmission within Uganda, the Emergency Committee may not yet declare a PHEIC at its imminent meeting. - Mod LXL
