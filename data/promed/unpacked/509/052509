EEE claims another south county farm animal
-------------------------------------------
An emu has died after contracting eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), at
least the third animal to perish from the disease in 2003 in Rhode Island,
according to the state Department of Environmental Management (DEM). The
emu was infected in Washington County last week, the DEM said Friday. A
week before, an emu from the same farm died after contracting similar
symptoms, which authorities believe was EEE.
EEE has been felt directly in the Westerly area, where one recovering horse
has been confirmed with the disease, another is suspected of dying from it,
and a South Kingstown horse is a confirmed casualty. State veterinarian Dr
Christopher Hannafin confirmed the one horse perished from EEE, and the
other has been infected but is expected to recover. State authorities say
no humans have been affected by the disease, but they urge residents to use
insect repellent and wear long sleeves and long pants.
EEE is carried by mosquitoes, which transmit the disease through bites. The
neurological disease causes the brain to swell and can be fatal. The
disease is not related to the deadlier West Nile virus, however, which is
also mosquitoborne.
