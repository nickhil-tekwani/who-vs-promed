One person died last month from new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(nvCJD or v-CJD) - the
degenerative brain disorder linked to BSE (Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy, mad cow disease) - the department of health said yesterday.
The death brings the total [death toll to 43 since nvCJD was first
recorded in 1995.
The number of nvCJD deaths so far this year is 4, compared with 16 last
year, 10 in 1997 and 10 in 1996. But epidemiologists say it is still too
soon to discount the possibility of a nvCJD epidemic, because the disease
has a long and unknown incubation period.
