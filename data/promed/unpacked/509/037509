Bulgaria's national veterinary service confirmed on Wed 12 Sep 2007,
a 2nd outbreak of the rare animal disease brucellosis in the south of
the country. The service said in a statement that 36 goats out of a
herd of 70 had tested positive for the infection in the southern town
of Harmanli.
The infection in Harmanli spread from a 1st outbreak in August 2007
in the nearby village of Valche pole, where dozens of goats and sheep
were found to be infected after a woman fell ill with
brucellosis-like symptoms. Later, 3 other people also tested positive
for the disease, which is often difficult to diagnose as its initial
symptoms, which include weakness, fever, sweating, headaches, and
joint pains, resemble influenza.
Humans can contract brucellosis from contact with sick sheep and
goats or by consuming infected meat, milk, or cheese. The disease,
which is very rare in Bulgaria, can be fatal for humans but cannot be
transferred from one person to another.

[It is not clearly stated whether the goatherd "testing positive" was
by bacteriologic or serologic means.
Brucellosis is considered a Category B bioterrorism agent, which is,
in nature, acquired as a zoonotic infection by humans. Its
manifestations are protean, including undulant fever, with positive
blood and/or bone marrow cultures, and it is a cause of localized
disease in many organ systems including skeletal, urinary tract,
central nervous system, liver, heart, and lung. The reader is
referred to Young EJ: Human brucellosis. Rev Infect Dis 1983; 5:
821-39 for a review of these manifestations.
Harmanli is a town in Haskovo province bordering on Greece. The
location of Haskovo can be found at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskovo>. - Mod.LL]
[_Brucella melitensis_ was reportedly absent from Bulgaria for at
least 64 years, namely since 1941 (or earlier?), until 2005. In June
2006, an outbreak was reported in goats kept in a traditional type
farm in Zlatograd in southern Bulgaria, bordering (endemically
infected) Greece. During 2007, 2 additional outbreaks in animals have
been recorded in southern Bulgaria, one in August in the village of
Valche pole, and the 2nd one now, in Harmanli.
Bulgaria's brucellosis control policy includes monitoring, screening,
and general surveillance; targetted surveillance has, so far, not
been applied. Vaccination is prohibited.
It will be interesting to note if systemic serological surveillance
for _B. melitensis_ will now be contemplated, particularly in dairy
sheep and goats, which may challenge public health through the
distribution of unpasteurised dairy products. - Mod.AS]
