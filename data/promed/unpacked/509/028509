Cholera claims 100 in Liberia
-----------------------------
A cholera outbreak has claimed more than 100 lives at an illegal gold
and diamond mine in southeast Liberia, it emerged on Thu, 11 Aug 2005.
The Catholic-run Radio Veritas reported that the outbreak in the town
of Butaw in Sinoe County, which started last week, was the result of
poor sanitation. A resident of the area, recently arrived in
Monrovia, said a creek used for drinking water was contaminated by
raw sewage.
Information Minister William Allen confirmed the outbreak, and the
health ministry had dispatched a team to the area.
According to the information ministry, thousands of illegal miners,
including many Ghanaians, Nigerians and Mauritanians, were said to be
operating illegally in Sinoe County in an area of protected forest.
