A comment on Dr. Michael Sauri's personal observations regarding immunity
to smallpox (see: Part [3 of Smallpox, re-vaccination & immunity
20011029.2672
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of huge importance in Dr. Sauri's response is what does he mean by "...only
a handful of immune responses were noted..."?
The main question we are faced with is how do we define "immune response"
and more importantly "protective immune responses" short of in vivo challenges?

Duration of Protection Against Smallpox Following a Childhood Immunization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
I know of at least 2 studies that speak to the duration of protection
against smallpox following a childhood immunization. The first study by
Hanna (1) followed the effect of vaccination in infancy on the severity and
case-fatality rates in variola major, according to age groups. The second
study by Mack (2) related age and vaccination status of cases of variola
major occurring after importations into western countries during the period
1950-1971. Both studies are presented in the definitive work on Smallpox by
Fenner and colleagues (3), and are discussed by the authors in the
following quotes.
"Data published by Hanna (1913) from an outbreak of variola major in
Liverpool, England, in 1902-1903, illustrate clearly the ameliorating
effect of childhood vaccination on the severity of smallpox (Table 1.11).
There was a striking difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated
patients in all age groups, both in the spectrum of severity and
case-fatality rates. Protection waned with age -- i.e., with increasing
intervals since vaccination -- but was substantial even in those aged more
than 50 years."
"Hanna's conclusions on the duration of protection against death provided
by vaccination, in those that got smallpox, are confirmed by the data
collected by Mack (1972), who analysed 680 cases of variola major occurring
after importation of the disease into Europe and Canada during the period
1950-1971 (Table 1.12). The case-fatality rate was 52% in unvaccinated
persons, 1.4% in those vaccinated 0-10 years before exposure, and only 11%
in those vaccinated over 20 years before exposure. The contrast is even
more striking if only the age group 10-49 years is considered: a
case-fatality rate of 49% in the unvaccinated and one of 4.3% in those
vaccinated over 20 years earlier."
Currently the status of vaccine immunity is determined by "challenging" the
individual with a vaccine strain of vaccinia virus. If no lesion develops,
the immunity is considered "solid", if a lesion or take appears the
individual's immunity is considered "less solid". The problem we have is
that we do not know what memory responses are important for protection
against severe smallpox. Therefore, we have no way to evaluate the existing
immunity in Americans who were vaccinated as children, even though it
probably exists to varying degrees.
