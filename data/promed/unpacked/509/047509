For the 1st time this season, eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has
been detected in Flagler County.

Although no human cases have been reported, health workers worry that
could change if people aren't careful.

Richard Toombs, a homeowner, has felt mosquito stings that come after
summer downpours.

"Yes, a few; every now and then you get bit," Toombs said.

County health department officials are telling residents like Toombs
to beware of mosquitoes because they could be carrying EEE, which has
already been detected in sentinel chickens in the county.

EEE is a mosquito-borne disease almost always fatal in horses. One
horse has tested positive for the disease.

Although rare, humans are susceptible as well.

"Actually, Flagler County has been fairly lucky. It hasn't shown up
in chicken flocks until recently. So we've put out an alert," said
Carl Laundrie, a county spokesman.

"(Were you aware that there was EEE in the area?) No, not until you
mentioned it," Toombs said.

Standing water is an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. Flagler
County residents told News 13 standing water is an issue in the county.

Mosquito control is stepping up spraying. They're also asking
homeowners to get rid of standing water.

"After heavy rains, you get standing water all along Belle Terre and
stuff like that," Toombs said. "(So it's an issue?) Yeah, I'd say so.
It doesn't really drain good."

"(Does the county have any issues with standing water throughout the
county?) Well, unfortunately, yes we do. There's a lot of standing
water in areas in the county, and that's why we have the mosquitoes,
the population we have," Laundrie said.

Sentinel chickens are chickens strategically placed throughout the
county for the sole purpose of being stung to detect diseases.

Laundrie said homeowners who want to see a mosquito spraying schedule
can log on to the East Flagler Mosquito Control District's website.

Northern Virginia's 1st ever confirmed case of a rare mosquito-borne
disease that is fatal to most horses is spreading concern among
health officials who worry that the virus is somehow moving beyond
its normal stamping grounds.

Eastern equine encephalitis, a non-contagious virus spread by
mosquitoes, not unlike West Nile Virus, was diagnosed last month
[August 2009] in a 28-year-old mare from Middleburg in eastern
Loudoun County's vaunted horse country. The mare -- which had been
riddled with health problems, including kidney disease -- was
euthanized on 6 Aug 2009. Brain tissue samples sent to the National
Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa were examined, and 3
weeks later, the lab confirmed the encephalitis diagnosis.

"Frankly, no one expected for the test to come back positive. This is
a very unusual case, and a lot of us have been saying to ourselves,
'Gee, what does this mean?'" said Elaine Lidholm, a spokeswoman for
the Virginia Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. "We
don't know if it's an isolated case or there's more out there in the
environment."

What makes the case so unusual is that the horse had not traveled
outside Loudoun County, its owners told state officials. The disease
-- which more commonly goes by the name "triple E" -- largely has
been concentrated in southwestern Virginia, especially the Tidewater
region, where mosquitoes are plentiful.

"Up here, we certainly have mosquitoes, but not the same as the
marshy areas," said Martin O. Furr, a professor of equine medicine at
Virginia Tech's Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in
Leesburg. "I suspect it's a random outlier case. But I suppose it
could be the tip of the iceberg ready to hit us."

Sandy Vine, a Middleburg horse trainer and show-jumping judge who
owns 3 horses, said her animals receive annual encephalitis shots.
Vine said the Loudoun case is worrisome, especially because most
horse owners in the area have little knowledge of the disease and its
symptoms. "You don't know if the horse was by itself or with others
or if the owners traveled a lot," she said.

Virginia's agriculture department began tracking equine encephalitis
cases in 2000. Since then, it has found 50 cases in horses, goats,
emus and alpacas, none north of Madison, a small community between
Culpeper and Shenandoah National Park, about 75 miles from Loudoun.

Although there are effective vaccines for the disease, there is no
cure. And although many horse owners vaccinate their animals every 6
to 12 months, with recommended booster shots in the interim, others
have forgone the USD 10 shots. In horses, the eastern strain of the
disease is 75 percent fatal, health officials say.

About 240 cases have been reported in humans in the United States
since 1964, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, with fewer since 1984 because of the decreasing number of
people living near marshland. Since 2003, there have been 5 human
cases in Virginia. The fatality rate for humans is lower than that
for horses, but those who survive the disease can be left with mild
to severe brain damage. Transmission of the virus is most common in
and around freshwater hardwood swamps in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states.

The report of triple E so far from its home base caught many Loudoun
veterinarians by surprise.

James Joyce, a veterinarian at Blue Ridge Veterinary Associates in
Purcellville, said the case is "concerning because it's a reminder
that it's now here." But Joyce cautioned that the disease is not
contagious and is "very uncommon to this region."

William H. McCormick, a Middleburg veterinarian who has been
practicing in Loudoun since 1974, said that he had never seen a case
of triple E in Loudoun but that an older horse with a weakened immune
system could be more prone to the virus. He added that the diagnosis,
taken by itself, was no cause for concern.

"I've seen West Nile over the years, but never triple E. You
certainly don't want to vaccinate horses for something they aren't
going to get, but I would do it if they're traveling to Florida or
the Eastern Shore," McCormick said.

Furr agreed, saying the horse, due to its age, could have become more
susceptible to viruses because of cortisol-secreting tumors. "Still,
in the years I've been here, this is the 1st case I've heard about," he said.

[The east coast of the US has received a large amount of rain this
year (2009) and has had a relatively cool summer. These are ideal
conditions for the mosquito to propagate. The disease has been found
as far north as Canada and Maine. It is sad, then, that owners would
be caught unaware and forego a lifesaving vaccine!

While humans can catch the disease, it can be caught from the
mosquito not from infected horses. - Mod.TG]
