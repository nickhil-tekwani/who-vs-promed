Are you sure that the botulism cases were associated with muktuk? I don't
know if the terminology in the Canadian arctic is different from that in
Alaska. In Alaska, at any rate, "muktuk" refers to whale skin and fat which
is eaten fresh (raw) or is frozen and then, when thawed, either eaten raw
or boiled. It is quite tasty.
"Mikiuk" or "mikiuq" or "mikigaq" refers to the fermented whale meat and
fat. In Alaska, this material has been associated with botulism cases.
