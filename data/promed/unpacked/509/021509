There are quite a number of publications on duration-of-immunity of rabies
vaccines in dogs, which explain very well how to prepare a challenge virus
for this species. The method several investigators, including myself, have
used, follows:
1. Harvest salivary glands from rabid dogs,
2. Prepare a 20 percent suspension with them,
3. Challenge un-vaccinated dogs by inoculation in the masseter muscle.
A proper dilution (previous titration in dogs) will kill 70% of the
animals. Our colleague from India is quite right; it's impossible to
believe that, having so many dog cases, local unvaccinated ones would be
resistant to rabies.
Good luck and contact me if you consider it necessary.

Consider that my informant in India tells us dogs regularly expire from
rabies in India. It must be assumed that most of them have been bitten by
other dogs and that the rabies street strain of India is responsible. The
same is true here in Thailand where we examine dogs almost daily in our
laboratory by FAT [Fluorescent antibody test and find they died from
rabies (usually by themselves as our veterinary scientists are hesitant to
euthanize them and simply wait till they are dead naturally. I would assume
your veterinary friend needs to increase the challenge dose and inject the
masseter muscle if he is unable to do intracerebral injection in dogs. You
should have plenty rabies virus available from the street in India just as
we do here in Thailand. Look at the WHO laboratory manual for rabies for
details on how to do a proper challenge test etc.
