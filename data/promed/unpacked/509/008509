South Korea on Sunday [27 Nov 2022] confirmed an additional avian influenza case at a duck farm in the southern region of the country, officials said.

The case of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI) strain of H5N1 was found at the duck farm located in Goheung, a southern coastal town, some 470 km [approx. 300 mi] south of Seoul, according to the officials.

It brought to 22 the total number of AI cases that have been reported at local poultry farms since this autumn [2022].

Quarantine measures have been taken on the farm where some 26 000 ducks are being raised. They include access restrictions at the farm and other at-risk facilities, culling of poultry, and an epidemiological investigation, they added.

[2] Japan, poultry, wild birds, spread

Cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza, or bird flu, are spreading at an unusual pace in Japan, with 18 outbreaks confirmed this season through [Sat 26 Nov 2022] at poultry farms in 12 of the country's 47 prefectures.

But that number is expected to rise further, in line with global trends. The agriculture ministry is asking farms to take thorough infection prevention measures and to swiftly find and report suspicious cases.

On [Fri 28 Oct 2022], the season's first cases were confirmed at farms in Okayama and Hokkaido prefectures. The cases marked the earliest outbreaks in a season recorded in Japan.

This month [November 2022], infections were reported intermittently in Kagawa, Hyogo, and Ibaraki prefectures.

The number of chickens culled this season has totaled 2.89 million so far, already exceeding the previous season's total of 1.89 million.

The largest number of bird flu outbreaks in a season in Japan stands at 52 outbreaks in 18 prefectures in 2020.

Bird flu is raging in many other parts of the world, too. This year [2022], a record 50.54 million birds were found infected in the United States. In Europe, infections were even confirmed in summer, when no migratory birds carrying the virus were spotted.

The developments have also sparked concerns about the price of chicken eggs. During the 2020 outbreak in Japan, most of the 9.87 million culled chickens were layers, accounting for some 5% of all such birds in the country at the time. As a result, egg prices increased to the highest levels since fiscal 2017.

According to the Japan Poultry Association, the standard egg price stood at Japanese yen 259 per kilogram as of Friday, higher than the previous fiscal year's high of Japanese yen 256. Soaring feed costs amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine are also pushing up prices of eggs, which normally see little price fluctuation.

According to the ministry, 2.2 million layers culled this season accounted for slightly over 1% of the total of such birds. When asked if this will impact the price of eggs this season, agriculture minister Tetsuro Nomura said, "There is no major impact."

However, if bird flu infections spread further, it is likely to affect the supply-demand balance of eggs.

"There is no choice but to implement thorough hygiene control," a ministry official said.

[On top of the HPAI H5N1 outbreaks on poultry farms, Japan has reported to the WOAH, on 28 Nov 2022, 11 new cases in wild birds, added to the 5 cases recorded earlier, since 30 Sep 2022. As indicated in the media report, the first outbreaks on poultry farms took place in Japan on 28 Oct 2022, starting earlier than usual. It was the first time a bird flu outbreak occurred at any farm in the country before November. The previous first-in-season record took place during the 2020-2021 season, confirmed on 5 Nov 2020.

In South Korea, the first seasonal HPAI H5N1 outbreak started at a duck farm on 16 Oct 2022, after the absence of virus circulation for about 6 months. The outbreak, in the southeastern county of Yecheon, was followed by additional outbreaks on poultry farms in the same county (20221026.8706376).

During 2022, 3 human infections were attributed, globally, to HPAI H5N1: 2 in Spain, and one in the USA. The last mortality attributed to this serotype took place in Nepal in 2019. - Mod.AS
