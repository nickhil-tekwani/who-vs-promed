A recent outbreak of distemper has been detected in raccoons across the South Bay and Harbor Area, spurring a call for dog owners to make sure their pets are vaccinated against the virus. Since August [2017], the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has received 39 reports of raccoons in the region showing signs of distemper. The disease does not affect humans, but can be fatal to unvaccinated dogs.

Most of the cases were detected in Redondo Beach and Wilmington, but animal control agencies also reported infections in Harbor City, Harbor Gateway, San Pedro and Rolling Hills Estates.

Of 3 deceased raccoons tested for the virus, 2 from Redondo Beach and Harbor City were infected. A 3rd from Wilmington also is expected to test positive, according to Emily Beeler, a veterinarian with the L.A. County Department of Public Health. No further testing is planned, since distemper has been confirmed as the cause of the sudden high numbers of sick raccoons.

Beeler said 87 percent of the cases were reported in September and October. "Distemper increases occur every few years in wildlife, especially in raccoons in L.A. County," she said in an email.

In addition to making sure vaccinations are up to date, dog owners are encouraged to keep their animals' food and water indoors. The virus is spread from wildlife through direct contact, via nasal or oral secretions.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Animals showing the same signs might be rabid. Unlike in the east coast, in California terrestrial rabies is more frequent in skunks than in raccoons. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
