[Since 17 Jan 2011, a total of 4 RVF outbreaks in livestock have been
reported by South Africa to the OIE. The 1st outbreak had, reportedly,
started on a sheep farm in the south (Western Cape Province) on 24
Dec 2010, and diagnosed in the laboratory on 7 Jan 2011. During
January 2011, 3 additional outbreaks have been reported, affecting
cattle (2 outbreaks) and alpacas (one outbreak, starting 2 Jan 2011,
in Drakenstein, Western Cape Province, involving 13 dead animals out
of a group of 71). It would be interesting to obtain more information
on the disease in alpacas: age, clinical observations. Are alpacas
included in the applied vaccination regime?

The 4 outbreaks stretched throughout the country; see map at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10161>.
The increased incidence of RVF and its wide distribution reflect, most
probably, prevailing weather conditions which enhance the emergence of
RVF-infected vectors, namely excessive rains.

In the above OIE report, there is an apparent discrepancy between the
statement "no vaccination" (under "control measures") and the
epidemiological comment "Vaccination widely applied by farmers and
provincial veterinary services. Large numbers of animals were
vaccinated during the 2010 event and vaccination is continuing." As
explained by South Africa's Animal Health Directorate in June 2010
(see ProMED archive 20100606.1886), vaccination is strongly
recommended to animal breeders by the authorities ahead of the disease
season, but is not compulsory; is such policy interpreted as "no
vaccination"?! clarification would help. - Mod.AS]
