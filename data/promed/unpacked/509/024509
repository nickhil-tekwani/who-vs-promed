Salmonella outbreak examined
---------------------------------
County and state health officials continue to investigate a salmonella
outbreak at a South San Francisco restaurant in July 2005 that may be
linked to raw almonds. One worker and 21 diners were left sick after eating
at La Tapatia Restaurant, but a county report from the health department on
communicable diseases notes the monthly increase is not considered out of
the ordinary.

A communicable disease team, including an environmental health specialist
and a public health nurse, visited the Grand Avenue facility and made
recommendations to prevent further disease transmission, according to the
report. Later visits included state health officials who collected samples
from those affected. The specimens from restaurant patrons matched a strain
of salmonella specific to raw almonds.

State investigators discovered La Tapatia bought raw almonds in bulk from a
large food retailer and repackaged them for resale. However, all of the
almonds confiscated from the restaurant all tested negative for that
strain, said Health Services spokeswoman Beverly Thames.

Currently, officials are comparing the outbreak to a similar incident in
Berkeley during the same period.

No illnesses have been reported since the initial batch.

[In 2004, a worldwide recall of raw almonds occurred due to contamination
of the nuts with _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis. It would be
interesting to know the relationship between the California strain and last
year's contaminant. - Mod.LL]
