State health officials say [there are] now a total of 3 cases of La
Crosse encephalitis in Mississippi. This week 2 cases are reported,
one each in Hinds and Adams counties. The 1st [case] of La Crosse
Encephalitis was reported in Yazoo County.

There are few, if any, symptoms and it is rarely fatal. [Although
most La Crosse virus infections are mild to inapparent, clinical
encephalitis is a serious disease. Patients, almost always children,
may suffer long periods of hospitalization and neurological sequelae.

The Central Shenandoah Health District Thu [24 Jul 2008] reported the
1st confirmed human case of La Crosse encephalitis in the district
this season [2008].

The health district is based in Staunton and also includes Waynesboro
and Augusta County along with several other jurisdictions. Central
Shenandoah did not give the exact location of the case, but said it
involved a young child who was hospitalized but has since recovered
from the infection. Children under 16 years of age tend to be at risk
for developing serious illness. In encephalitis, the brain swells and
that can be life threatening.

Only about 70 cases are reported in the United States annually. La
Crosse encephalitis is caused by a virus that is spread through the
bite of a particular species of mosquito. Both the eastern treehole
mosquito, _Aedes triseriatus_ and the Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes
albopictus_, are capable of spreading the virus.

Dr Doug Larsen, Central Shenandoah health director, said the risk
for mosquito-borne disease is now higher in Virginia. "People can
reduce their risk by eliminating mosquito breeding areas and
protecting themselves from mosquito bites while outside," Larsen
said. He said the risk of mosquito-borne infections can vary with a
person's age.

The Virginia Department of Health recommends the following tips to
reduce exposure to mosquitoes:
- wear long, loose and light-colored clothing;
- use insect repellent products with no more than 50 percent DEET for
adults and 10-30 percent for children. Follow instructions when using
insect repellents;
- overturn or remove containers in your yard where water collects, such
as old tires, potted plant trays, buckets, and toys;
- eliminate standing water on tarpaulins or flat roofs;
- clean out birdbaths and wading pools [& pet water dishes] once a week;
- clean roof gutters and downspout screens regularly.

[The following comment was given in ProMED-mail archive no. 20080717.2164:

La Crosse virus (LACV) is in the California serogroup of viruses in
the _Bunyaviridae_ family. Although most LACV infections [result in]
subclinical or mild febrile illnesses, frank encephalitis progressing
to seizures and coma can occur [but] the case fatality rate is less
than one per cent. In the USA, particularly in the upper midwestern
states, an average of 70 clinical cases are reported annually, the
vast majority in pre-adolescent children. Hospitalizations and
subsequent care can be lengthy with costs approaching USD 450 000.

The virus is transmitted by _Aedes triseriatus_ mosquitoes and
maintained by transovarial transmission with amplification in forest
rodents (chipmunks _Tamias striatus_ and squirrels _Sciurus
carolinensis_). More recently, the virus has been isolated from the
Asian tiger mosquito, _Aedes albopictus_, which has become
established in the Western Hemisphere. No vaccine against LACV is
available. A brief fact sheet for LACV and its pathogenesis and
epidemiology provided by the US CDC can be accessed at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/arbor/lacfact.htm>.
