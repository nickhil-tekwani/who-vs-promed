[The report above as well as the previous ones this year (2013) provide no indication of the etiological agent responsible for these encephalitis cases in Bihar state. In reports from previous years, acute encephalitis syndrome [AES] in north eastern India has been attributed in part or entirely to Japanese encephalitis [JE] virus infections. However, in some instances, JE virus infections are reported to be responsible for a minority of the cases. There is no indication in these or previous reports this year [2013] whether the children have been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis virus infection.

Without knowing the specific etiology of the encephalitis cases above, targeted control measures will not be possible. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving reports of the conclusions of the team of experts from the National Centre for Disease Control that went to the affected areas on 5 Jun 2013.
