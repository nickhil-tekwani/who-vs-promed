More Asian longhorned ticks are being found in Staten Island parks after a new study showed the number of ticks increased nearly 12 times from 2017 to 2018.

Researchers from Columbia University, who have been surveying the borough the last 2 summers, found a significant rise in the number of Asian longhorned ticks spotted in borough parks, from 190 ticks in 2017 to 2238 ticks in 2018. These numbers include ticks in the larvae, nymph, and adult life stages, according to the study.

The researchers have studied the new invasive tick species on Staten Island to learn more about the rise in ticks and Lyme disease. The study was published in the April 2019 issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.

The graphic below shows the number of Asian longhorned ticks found in Staten Island parks in 2017 and 2018 [see URL].

And those numbers could grow, as a single female Asian longhorned tick can produce up to 2000 eggs at a time without mating, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). As a result, hundreds to thousands of ticks can be found on a single animal, person or in the environment.

The study detailed concerns of the tick's rapid emergence because it can reproduce asexually, feeds on a wide range of domestic and wildlife hosts, and can handle a wide range of environmental temperatures.

The graphic below shows the Staten Island parks that had the highest number of Asian longhorned ticks in 2017 [see URL]. Blue Heron Park, Willowbrook Park and Silver Lake Park each had one Asian longhorned tick spotted.

The 1st of the species spotted in New York City was found in the southernmost section of Staten Island, according to the city Department of Health. The tick is normally found in areas of east Asia, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

Researchers from Tick Encounter Resource Center at the University of Rhode Island also found the invasive species in Tottenville's Conference House Park last August 2019.

The CDC reported that no harmful germs have been found yet in the ticks collected in the United States. But the agency is still urging caution about the tick's potential to spread disease. In other countries, bites from these ticks can make people and animals seriously ill.

Staten Islanders should continue to follow procedures to prevent tick bites and tick-borne diseases, and use effective tick-repellent products, especially in the summer months.

The photo below, created by the Columbia University researchers, shows seasonal activity of the Asian longhorned ticks in Staten Island during a survey in 2018. The graphic shows larvae were more active in August [2018], while adult tick activity peaked in July [2018, see URL].

[The Asian longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, is now well established in New York and apparently increasing on Staten Island. As the report above indicates, this tick can reproduce asexually, producing hundreds to thousands of offspring in a relatively short period of time. Detection of this tick in 2010 and again in 2013 provides evidence that it had been in the USA for several years before it was identified in New Jersey in 2017. By whatever means -- birds or livestock movement or both -- the tick has been spread around and as of 2018 has been found in 9 states. It doubtless is now established in the eastern USA to stay. As noted earlier, either the tick is spreading rapidly, or surveillance has been intensified, or both.

As the report above indicates, this tick is a vector of important pathogens that infect people and domestic animals. Fortunately, so far, there is no evidence for this tick transmitting the tickborne pathogens that already occur in the eastern USA, such as Powassan virus and Lyme borreliosis. All tests for the presence of these pathogens in the ticks have been negative so far. One hopes that there will be intensified surveillance in broad areas in the eastern USA to find out whether there are additional longhorned ticks in new areas. Ticks can be extremely difficult to control once established in an area.
