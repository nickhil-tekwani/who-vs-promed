All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and National Institute of Chemical Technology (NICT) in a report to the Andhra Pradesh government stated that pesticide remains could be the cause of the disease which affected the people of Eluru. How it entered their bodies should be further investigated.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy held a video conference on the cause of illness in Eluru with experts. The CM said all types of tests should be conducted so incidents like Eluru would not be repeated.

The Chief Minister instructed officials to focus on maintenance of dumping yards and to conduct all possible tests across West Godavari district. Also, drinking water samples from all sources in all the districts should be tested. All these tests should be analysed, and necessary action should be taken. The CM added that AIIMS and IICT should conduct a deep study long-term on the causes of the outbreak in Eluru and asked the Chief Secretary to prepare an action plan. A plan should be made to set up 3 state-level labs.

The National Institution of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad has reported that residues of pesticides were found in the samples of tomato and brinjal and that these pesticides could have been the reason for the illness.

A report from AIIMS, New Delhi states that lead was detected in blood from the patients, and nickel was found in all the milk samples. Organochlorine was the reason for illness in the patients, and pesticides could be the reason for the presence of organochlorine and would have entered the human body in the process of the food cycle. They said lead was found in blood samples of relatives of patients and that long-term study is needed on it.

Experts from IICT said 21 samples of water were collected along with blood samples of people and animals. No traces of heavy metals like lead, nickel and arsenic were found in water samples, and also pesticide residues were not found in water samples. Endosulfan and DDD were traced [at trace levels] in blood samples. Lead was found in some blood samples, and no traces of organophosphates were found.

National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) Hyderabad had also conducted tests on air pollution in Eluru and said that pollution in the air was at permissible limits. They have tested underground water and surface water and found all metals are in permissible limits except mercury.

Experts at AIIMS and the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT) have found the reason behind the mysterious disease having gripped Andhra Pradesh's Eluru city. Of a total 612 people who were hospitalised, 605 have been discharged. One person succumbed to the illness.

Experts from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS-Delhi), ICT, the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), and other research organisations confirmed the presence of pesticide residues, organochlorine, lead, and nickel in milk and vegetables as the reasons behind the illness.

As per reports submitted to the government by these institutions, pesticides and herbicides were found in more than permissible limits in vegetables. Additionally, scientists at the NIN found traces of mercury in rice and residues of organo-phosphorous in blood.

A study of water, conducted by the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board, revealed no presence of heavy metal in water. The Institute of Preventive Medicine found no heavy metal in milk.

Reports related to the analysis of meat and fish were yet to come, according to state Health Commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar.

After going through the reports, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy asked the experts to trace how lead, nickel, organochlorine and organo-phosphorous entered humans.

The CM asked the AIIMS, New Delhi, and IICT, Hyderabad, to constantly monitor the situation in Eluru, conduct an in-depth analysis, and suggest remedial measures.

The Chief Minister said indiscriminate use of pesticides and unauthorised insecticides should be stopped. "Take this programme up for a month. Educate farmers on organic farming and use of permitted pesticides. This way we can prevent contamination of food items," he said.

Meanwhile, the state government constituted a 21-member multi-disciplinary committee, headed by Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney, to probe the source of the infection thoroughly, examine the causes, and suggest remedial measures to prevent the occurrence of such events in future.

The government directed the committee to submit a comprehensive report with a detailed action plan to avert such incidences in future.

An unknown illness having put hundreds of people in the hospital in India's southern Andhra Pradesh state has left doctors and experts baffled.

One person has died, and over 600 fell ill as the disease swept through the town of Eluru, home to 200 000, on 5 Dec 2020. Most reported similar symptoms such as seizures, headaches and vomiting. A week after the incident, no new cases were reported, and most of those taken ill have been discharged from hospital.

A multi-disciplinary panel of the state government has been tasked with investigating the cause of the illness. A central government team was also sent to investigate.

Conflicting findings to date have made it difficult to untangle exactly what caused the illness. Experts from a range of institutions have confirmed the presence of lead and nickel in blood samples, as well as in milk and vegetables. Scientists at a number of other institutions believe the outbreak was caused by organochlorine pesticide residues in food. Elevated levels of mercury have also been found in groundwater, compared with surface water, and in food too.

While the official investigation has stated it had found no evidence of contamination of drinking water, others disagree. A private lab found elevated levels of pesticide residues in drinking water supplied to certain localities, DDD at thousands of times the permitted level, as well as methoxychlor and the herbicide alachlor. DDT levels were also recorded at 14.16mg/l against permissible limits of 0.001mg/l. The banned pesticide endosulfan was also found in some blood samples, as well as DDD, a metabolite of DDT.

"DDT is banned in agriculture, but the health department still allows its use," said Shashi Vemuri, a former entomologist from the Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, Hyderabad.

"The presence of mercury in rice at elevated levels is alarming," Vemuri added. "Also, the official reports do not disclose the name and quantity of pesticides. High levels of pesticides target the nervous system."

The initial reports by doctors and researchers found lead and organochlorine compounds in blood samples and organochlorine and organophosphorus in serum samples. Farmers in the region are known to use higher levels of pesticides on crops and vegetables than the rest of the country.

Tharaknath Vemuri, former head of the neurology department at the Guntur Medical College, Andhra Pradesh, said the symptoms of lead or mercury poisoning are not as abrupt as those seen in these patients. "In the absence of any specific treatment, such a rapid recovery is also very unlikely. As the water and blood samples tested by reputed institutes have shown pesticide residues, it is possible the symptoms could be because of pesticides."

The official report from the 14 institutions is yet to be made public. Experts, however, said a long-term study of food and water will be required over the next few months to ascertain the exact cause of the illness.

[What is most unusual about this outbreak is the number of people affected almost simultaneously or in a very short window of time. This indicates that while levels of mercury, lead, nickel, and other chemicals are a concern, they did not cause this situation, or all the levels would be quite high, not small or trace amounts.

Some of these low levels may be ingested perhaps from grass the cattle eat, and then are passed through the milk, especially some fat-soluble chemicals.

Unfortunately, it may have been an airborne substance which caused the rapid affects and may not be able to be tested for at this point.

We continue to wait on the report of the findings. - Mod.TG
