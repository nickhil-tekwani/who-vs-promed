The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday [1 Jul 2014] confirmed 2 new cases of Japanese encephalitis, urging the public to take precautions as the mosquito-borne disease has already entered its peak season.

The 2 new cases are a 56-year-old man from Changhua County and a 70-year-old woman from Greater Tainan, both of whom live near potentially high-risk breeding sites of mosquitoes, such as rice fields, hog and pigeon farms, the centers said in a statement.

There have been 6 reported cases of Japanese encephalitis this year [2014]: 2 in Greater Tainan, 2 in Changhua, 1 in Greater Taichung and 1 in Chiayi City. All of the cases are aged over 45.

The centers urged the public to take preventive measures against the disease, such as getting vaccinated, avoiding high-risk areas during dawn and dusk, wearing light-colored long-sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent on any bare skin.

[Cases of Japanese encephalitis occur sporadically in Taiwan. There is no indication in this report if the 2 individuals in the above report had been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infection. As moderator CP noted in a 17 Jul 2012 ProMED-mail post reporting 2 cases of JEV infections in Taiwan in 2012 (archive no. 20120717.1204835): "Taiwan is within the broad geographical endemic Japanese encephalitis belt that extends from South Asia through Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the northern tip of Australia. Japanese encephalitis is the principal cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000 to 50 000 cases reported annually. Although most Japanese encephalitis virus infections are inapparent, they can progress to encephalitis and death, with neurological sequelae in some of those who survive. The virus is maintained in birds and transmitted by _Culex_ mosquitoes. Swine may serve as amplifying hosts.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease. The Japanese encephalitis season in Taiwan is from May-October, and although Japanese encephalitis infection has been infrequent in Taiwan, those that work in high-risk areas, such as rice paddies, livestock quarters, ponds, and irrigation ditches at dusk, when the mosquitoes are at their most active, should be vaccinated. To lower the chances of infection, long sleeves and pants should be worn, and mosquito repellant should be applied to exposed areas if activity in these places cannot be avoided.
