Few clues in Hong Kong H5N1 analysis
------------------------------------
In response to the recent identification of H5N1 avian influenza in a
59-year-old woman, Hong Kong officials are stepping up their
inspections of poultry farms, tests on live birds, and cleaning of
poultry farms and markets, Dr York Chow, Hong Kong's secretary for
food and health, said today [18 Nov 2010] in a press release [see [2]
below]. He said public hospitals are taking precautions such as
shortening visiting hours and asking visitors to wear masks. The
woman is still in serious condition and has been transferred to
Princess Margaret Hospital.

Chow said initial tests on the H5N1 virus that sickened her reveal
that it belongs to clade 2.3.2, common in Asia. He said the finding
doesn't pinpoint where the woman, who had recently traveled to the
Chinese mainland, was infected, though the flu incubation period
suggests she probably contracted the virus during her trip.

In other developments, Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection (CHP)
today [18 Nov 2010] released a detailed clinical report about the
woman's infection in the latest issue of its Communicable Diseases
Watch [see <http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/cdw_v7_24.pdf>]. After
she started having symptoms she visited the doctor and the emergency
department before her hospital admission on Sun 14 Nov 2010. When her
condition deteriorated she was transferred to an intensive care unit
and treated with oseltamivir (Tamiflu). She has not received
mechanical ventilation. Her close contacts are under quarantine, and
some have been given prophylaxis.

So far all respiratory specimens from close contacts have tested
negative for the H5N1 virus.

Bird flu precautions enhanced
-----------------------------
Secretary for Food and Health Dr York Chow says the Government will
bolster measures to guard against avian flu, although there is no
significant increase in the risk of a pandemic in Hong Kong.
Government officers will inspect local poultry farms and conduct more
checks on live birds. Cleaning work at poultry farms and markets will
be strengthened.

Speaking after an inter-departmental meeting on avian influenza today
[18 Nov 2010], Dr Chow said the infected 59-year-old woman, whose
case was reported yesterday, has been transferred to Princess
Margaret Hospital and is still in serious condition. He said
preliminary tests show she has a clade 2.3.2 avian virus which is
common in Asia. As the virus can be found in Hong Kong and on the
Mainland, it is hard to confirm whether the case is a local or
imported one. Experts said the incubation period indicates she likely
contracted the virus on the Mainland. The Government has informed the
World Health Organisation and the Mainland authorities of the case.
It has also asked Guangdong to strengthen surveillance and checks on
poultry farms supplying birds to Hong Kong. So far no problems have
been found on these farms.

The Hospital Authority has tightened precautionary measures in public
hospitals, like shortening visiting hours, and requiring staff and
visitors to wear masks. Tests will be conducted on patients with
fever and other flu symptoms, those who have just returned to Hong
Kong from Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, and patients who have
visited markets and had close contact to poultry.

The Centre for Health Protection has traced the 8 people who had
close contact with the 59-year-old patient, including 3 of her family
members and 5 patients who shared her cubicle in Tuen Mun Hospital.
They have not developed abnormal symptoms so far. The centre has
informed local doctors of the latest situation and will remind
institutions and schools to take preventive measures.

[So far there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the
avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus responsible for the illness of the
59-year-old patient hospitalised in Hong Kong, and the source or her
infection remains unexplained although circumstantial evidence
suggests that she was infected during the course of an extended visit
to Mainland China. The concern of the authorities in Hong Kong has
been focused on containing any potential spread of infection, rather
than investigation of the circumstances of the victim's original
exposure.
