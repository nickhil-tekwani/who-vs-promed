[The number of fatal cases in Uttar Pradesh and nearby states has continued to climb steadily since June of this year (2012). As of 4 Oct 2012 there were 433 reported fatal cases and now that total has increased to 588 as reported above. The etiology of these encephalitis cases is not mentioned in the report above, but an article in the Times of India on 22 Oct 2012 indicated that with waterborne acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) now making up close to 95 per cent of the encephalitis cases across eastern Uttar Pradesh, there is a renewed focus on the water the area's children are drinking (see ProMED-mail archive no 20121023.1360246). Earlier reports attributed some or all of the encephalitis cases to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections. Still other reports associated the cases with polluted water, suggesting enterovirus infections. The JEV vaccination status of these cases has never been given in this or prior reports.
