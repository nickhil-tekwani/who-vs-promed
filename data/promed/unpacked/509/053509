[1] Florida outbreak

The Alachua County Health Department is warning residents that there are 12 confirmed cases of mumps, primarily from college students at the University of Florida.

"This is a little more than usual," says Steve Orlando, University of Florida spokesman.

Alachua County normally receives around 2 reported cases a year, and UF believes more students could be infected.

"So, it's curious because these are individuals who are vaccinated, and that's what we are seeing nationwide," says Paul Myers, Alachua County Health Department administrator.

Officials say it is still unclear why there has been an uptick with the virus. So far, the CDC shows 736 people have contracted mumps nationwide in 2019.

"The sharing of the utensils, sharing of the cups, sharing of the water bottles, you know it is a very common thing for students to share those things, and that's exactly the kind of thing that could lead to transmission," says Orlando.

[2] Immigrant detention centers

Immigrants have been quarantined in over 30 ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] detention centers across the U.S. for mumps and a few cases of chickenpox in recent months, according to a Quartz investigation into information shared by attorneys.

Why it matters: Mumps is from a fast-spreading but relatively mild virus that sometimes causes serious complications. But the people who are quarantined also are not allowed access to their attorneys and cannot attend bond or asylum proceedings, Quartz points out.

By the numbers: Quartz found nearly 300 confirmed cases of mumps in ICE facilities and other immigration detention centers across the country, with the most cases concentrated in Texas, Mississippi, Arizona and Georgia.

Not all state or county health departments monitor disease outbreaks in ICE facilities. Louisiana and California "said they had no data on disease in ICE facilities," Quartz reports, so the case numbers could be higher.

"Local health authorities tasked with keeping civilian populations in their areas safe said they have no idea how widespread the mumps epidemic is in immigration facilities around the US," Quartz reports.

There are also few consequences for ICE personnel who don't follow immunization or follow-up standards for detainees, per a recent internal investigation.

The recommended 2 doses of MMR vaccine are roughly 88 percent effective at preventing mumps, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

[Mumps is a viral illness caused by a paramyxovirus, a member of the Rubulavirus family. The average incubation period for mumps is 16 to 18 days, with a range of 12 to 25 days. The mumps virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract and is transmitted person to person through direct contact with saliva or respiratory droplets of a person infected with mumps. The risk of spreading the virus increases the longer and the closer the contact a person has with someone who has mumps. The infectious period is considered from 2 days before to 5 days after parotitis onset, although virus has been isolated from saliva as early as 7 days prior to and up to 9 days after parotitis onset. Mumps virus has also been isolated up to 14 days in urine and semen.

When a person is ill with mumps, they should avoid contact with others from the time of diagnosis until 5 days after the onset of parotitis by staying home from work or school and staying in a separate room if possible [https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/hcp.html].

If not strict quarantine, prior to testing, the suspected mumps cases should be isolated/confined to separate living areas with hand hygiene and social distancing during the infectious period, since the high concentration of people in the camps can potentially result in outbreaks. - Mod.UBA]
