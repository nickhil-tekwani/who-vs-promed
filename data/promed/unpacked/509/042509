[Professor Brown's 1st hand, speedy information is much appreciated.

The source of infection remains to be sorted out. The most recent HPAI H7N7 outbreak in Europe took place in north eastern Italy (Emilia Romagna) in August 2013. About 1 million birds were destroyed.

According to the information provided by the Italian animal health authorities, all workers taking part in depopulation measures on infected premises applied strict prevention procedures and wore protective clothing (overalls, rubber gloves, boots, turbo ventilated masks with FP3 filter, etc.). They were regularly checked for symptoms of avian influenza infection. Infection was detected in 3 of the workers, mainly expressed by conjunctivitis.

Further details, presented by Italy to the EU's SCFCAH (Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health) on 9 Sep 2013, can be found at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/1011092013_avian_italy_en.pdf.

The most serious HPAI H7N7 epizootic, so far, was recorded in the Netherlands in 2003.

Hopefully, spread in the UK will be prevented by the strict control measures already in operation. - Mod.AS
