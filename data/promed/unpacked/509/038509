Cuba: Doctor facing 13-year sentence for "enemy propaganda" should be
immediately released
Amnesty International is today calling for the immediate and unconditional
release of Cuban doctor and prisoner of conscience, Desi Mendoza Rivero,
who is facing a possible 13-year sentence next Monday for using the mass
media to spread "enemy propaganda."
Desi Mendoza Rivero was detained simply for accusing the Cuban authorities
of covering up the true extent of a dengue fever epidemic and of not
taking sufficient measures to control it," Amnesty International said
today. "Expressing views which are at odds with official positions is no
reason to be taken to court."
Forty-three-year-old Dr. Mendoza, who has been in detention since his
arrest on 25 June 1997 and is currently held in Boniato Prison, just
outside Santiago de Cuba, was tried in that city on 18 November.
Sentencing is expected on 24 November. The basis of the charge against
him was that he had issued statements, which were later disseminated by
foreign newspapers and broadcast media, regarding an epidemic of dengue
fever in Santiago de Cuba which, according to him, had caused several
deaths.
According to reports of the six-hour trial, the prosecutor requested a
13-year sentence for Dr. Mendoza, who was able to speak on his own behalf
for some 40 minutes. His lawyer refuted each of the allegations against
him and refrained from requesting a lower sentence on the grounds that in
his view Dr. Mendoza had committed no crime. When several members of the
public applauded the lawyer's statement, they were removed from the
courtroom.
All media in Cuba are state-controlled and dissidents are frequently
arrested and imprisoned for speaking out against the government and
criticizing its policies. In 1994, Dr. Mendoza founded the Colegio Medico
Independiente de Santiago de Cuba, Santiago de Cuba Independent Medical
Association, an unofficial organization not recognized by the Cuban
authorities of which he is president, and it is believed that the action
against him may be at least partly in reprisal for his peaceful activities
with that organization.

[I know I speak for Charlie Calisher, and I believe also for the other
ProMED-mail moderators, when I say that we deplore any interference in the
free distribution of information about matters of public health importance,
and specifically about outbreaks of infectious disease. There frequently
are public disagreements about the numbers of cases and the extent of
epidemics, but that is no reason to imprison those who report on them -
