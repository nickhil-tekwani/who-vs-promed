Health practitioners at a Bloemfontein hospital who have come into contact
with a Free State woman who died of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
will be monitored for symptoms for up to a month, a hospital official said
on Thur 19 Jan 2006.
A specialist physician and some personnel were placed under observation
after test results on Tue 17 Jan 2006 confirmed that CCHF was responsible
for the death of [a 51 year old woman] on Sun 15 Jan 2006. The patient was
apparently bitten by a tick in December 2005 on her farm near Petrusburg.
She was admitted to hospital on Monday last week with severe vomiting. Her
husband was also under observation but had not shown any symptoms yet. A
hospital spokesperson reportedly said there was no danger to the public at
the hospital, as the CCHF virus could only spread through contact with the
fresh blood of an infected person.
The Free State Department of Health had been informed on Tuesday about the
situation. CCHF is a viral infection that causes bleeding, according to
information on the disease from the Department of Virology at the
Universitas Hospital. _Hyalomma_ ticks, the main arachnid that spreads the
disease from animals to humans, are dark brown to black in colour with red
to orange brown and white-banded legs. In some cases humans can also pick
up the virus if an infected tick is crushed between the fingers.

[There is always an appreciable risk of nosocomial infection when a patient
suffers severe hemorrhage or requires surgical intervention. The incubation
period under such circumstances may be 3 to 6 days, compared with 3 to 12
days following tick bite. - Mod.CP]
