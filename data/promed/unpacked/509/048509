Anthrax spreads in Upper Hunter
---------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) says while the number of
confirmed deaths of cattle in the Upper Hunter from an anthrax
outbreak is 12, up to 20 animals are believed to have died. The
disease has now spread to 5 properties after the initial outbreak on
a farm at Rouchel, near Scone [That is 2 new outbreaks since the
previous report. - Mod.MHJ]. All nearby stock are being vaccinated
and the dead animals are being burned to stop the disease moving further.

DPI's deputy chief vet Ian Roth says investigations into how the
outbreak occurred are continuing. "We've confirmed it in about 12
animals, that's in the lab but there are more animals that have died
on these properties," he said. "It's a little bit hard to get the
precise numbers because animals do die from other conditions in the
paddock. Certainly on some of the properties there have been more
than we have confirmed it in.

The DPI's Brett Fifield says vaccinations are working and it is
unlikely the disease will spread further. "The situation in Scone is
stable; there have been minor mortalities of cattle, the mortalities
have stopped and a vaccination campaign is underway and we'll stem
the spread of the disease," he said.

[When tabanid flies are involved in spreading this disease it is wise
to vaccinate neighbouring stock out 5-10 kms (3.1-6.2 miles) from the
index outbreak. Female horseflies can amble out to 8 kms (5 miles)
without straining themselves while snacking on the occasional cow.
While this normally results in one or 2 cases per newly affected
farm, if the owner is not aware of the risk and ignores these deaths,
subsequent multiple deaths can act as a staging post for more
contaminated flies to leapfrog the disease further out. Vaccination
essentially kicks in on Day 8 post vaccination.

While Ian Roth is correct about cattle dying from many more common
causes other than anthrax, it is wise in an outbreak situation to use
the Scottish foot-test and presume that any unexpected death is, in
this case, anthrax until evidence is available to indicate another
cause. Usually these other deaths are from clostridial infections,
which the farmer should have been preventing by routine annual
vaccination anyway. - Mod.MHJ]
