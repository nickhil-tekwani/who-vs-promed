According to La Repubblica (Nov. 30th) at least three women in Genoa were
inseminated with [semen from a donor infected with hepatitis C virus
(HCV). The [semen was distributed from a sperm bank in Florence. This
same bank apparently supplies other artificial insemination centers in
Italy. Apparently the women gave birth to normal children. This
particular donor may have supplied [semen for 3 years. [Note: this may
give some insight into the risk of HVC transmission by sexual contact - AO

[This incident is causing quite the public scandal in Italy at this time,
with calls being made for tighter controls on sperm banks. - Mod.CHC
