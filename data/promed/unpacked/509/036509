The number of people who have become infected with a super bug at
Maasstad hospital in Rotterdam has risen to 98, according to press
reports on Wednesday [17 Aug 2011].

Last week the number of infections since the outbreak began in July
[2011] was 88. All the cases concern patients at the hospital who
shared a room with a carrier of the super bug before 18 Jul 2011. So
far, 27 patients have died after becoming infected with the
multi-resistant _Klebsiella [pneumoniae_] bacteria.

The hospital is still looking into the exact role of the bacteria in
the deaths and around 1750 patients and ex-patients have been tested
so far.

The outbreak is now under control because there have been no
infections in new patients admitted since 18 Jul 2011, says the
hospital.

[The news release above is a follow-up report on a nosocomial OXA-48
carbapenemase-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ outbreak that was
covered in a prior ProMED-mail post (Gram-negative bacilli, multidrug
resistance - Panama, Netherlands 20110731.2303). The number of deaths
remains the same at 27, but the report above gives the number of cases
infected with this organism as 98. All infected patients apparently
shared a hospital room at some time with the index case before 18 Jul
2011.

Carbapenemases are beta-lactamases that degrade carbapenem beta-lactam
antibiotics, and fall into molecular classes A, C, B, and D. Classes
A, C, and D have serine at the active site and class B, zinc at the
active site. IMP, NDM-1, and VIM are class B carbapenemases; KPC are
class A carbapenemases, and OXA-types are class D carbapenemases.

The OXA-48 carbapenemase was first isolated from _Enterobacteriaceae_
in Turkey in 2008 (Carrer A, et al: Spread of
OXA-48-positive-carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ isolates
in Istanbul, Turkey. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2008; 52(8): 2950-4;
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2493117/). Outbreaks due
to OXA-48 producing organisms were subsequently described in Europe
(France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom), Argentina,
Lebanon, Israel, Morocco, and Tunisia
(http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=19921).
Carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ producing an OXA-48 type
beta-lactamase was first described in the Netherlands in January 2011
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21252273). The isolate was
recovered from a patient who was transferred from a hospital in India
to an intensive care unit in the Netherlands.

Rotterdam, with a population of 603 425 in March 2010, is the
2nd-largest city in the Netherlands and the largest port in Europe
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam). Rotterdam is located in
the Province of South Holland in the southwest of the Netherlands.
