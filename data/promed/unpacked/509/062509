Two Romanians admitted to hospital with anthrax
-----------------------------------------------
BUCHAREST, Oct 2 (Reuters): Two people in south eastern Romania are being
treated in hospital for anthrax, an animal disease which can be transmitted
to humans, health officials said on Monday. "Samples taken from a 38 year
old woman and a 67 year old pensioner from the county of Tulcea tested
positive for a mild form of anthrax," Adriana Argetoianu, head of the
health watchdog in the Danube delta county of Tulcea, told Reuters. "The
two peasants are now out of danger, recovering after being treated
intensively with antibiotics."
Preliminary investigations indicated the two had slaughtered a calf after
it got sick in mid-September in the village of Topolog, some 220 km (140
miles) east of Bucharest. Another 18 villagers who ate the veal have been
investigated, but tests showed no problems, she said.
According to local vets, cattle from the region had been given anthrax
vaccine shots. Anthrax cases in cattle and humans are sporadic in Romania,
which is to join the European Union in 2007.
The disease, whose symptoms include high fever, an enlarged spleen and
swellings of the throat in some animals, can be fatal to humans who come
into contact with the animals' skin, meat, or blood, epidemiologists say.

[Calves are usually not vaccinated so this animal might well have been
susceptible. Romania regularly reports a few cases in cattle and sheep each
year, and occasionally in horses and swine. Human cases reflect this: 2000
(51 with 2 deaths); 2001 (7); 2002 (1); 2004 (2); and 2005 (1). Thanks to
Brent.
