Disease ravages banana plantations
-----------------------------------
The income of some 200 farmers in Penang [Pulau Pinang] is in jeopardy after a disease ravaged their banana plantations, turning parts of the plant black.

[A local] assemblyman said the Moko disease had so far affected 153 ha [378 acres] out of 336 ha [830 acres] of the banana plantations. After the disease was discovered last November [2013], the Agricultural Department cleared 30 ha [74 acres] of the plantations, he said. "We need to destroy the plants which have the bacteria to prevent it from spreading. Farmers are hoping for some funds to clear the affected plantation because the longer they wait, the more difficult it will be for them to replant," he said.

The department, he said, had also suggested for human activities to be restricted at affected plantations. Farmers were also advised to grow other crops such as mango for at least another three years to earn an income.

[Moko, as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana and plantain known as blood disease and bugtok, are caused by members of the _R. solanacearum_ (Rs) species complex (see link below). Within the complex, strains causing moko and bugtok are closely related causing similar symptoms (including wilting, fruit rot, blackening of suckers, bacterial ooze), but the blood disease bacterium is more distantly related with characteristic red internal discolouration ("blood") of fruits and pseudostems. Moko is one of the most serious banana diseases, with reported yield losses of over 70 percent, but all 3 diseases cause severe yield losses and eventually death of the plants.

The bacteria are spread by water, wind, infected plant material or soil, and mechanical means (including human activities, animals, insects). Suckers for propagation pose a high risk of spreading the diseases. Ornamentals and weed species may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Infection can occur via roots or flowers depending on the host cultivar and pathogen strain. The primary means of control is exclusion from areas that are disease-free and eradication of infected plants where the pathogens are present. Disease management may also include cultural, chemical (for example soil treatments) and biocontrol (antagonistic microorganisms) measures or combinations of these. Certified clean planting material is essential. No resistant banana or plantain cultivars are known.

Moko was reported from Malaysia for the 1st time in 2014 (ProMED-mail post 20140310.2323075) from 5 other peninsular states (Kedah, Selangor, Pahang, Negeri Sembilan, Johor), with an incidence exceeding 90 percent in some plantations. Now it appears to have spread to Penang as well.

Before its appearance in Malaysia, moko was known to occur in the New World and the Philippines, bugtok only in the Philippines, and blood disease only in the Indonesian archipelago. Since 2008 (ProMED-mail post 20081215.3937), an undiagnosed lethal disease of bananas has been spreading in Malaysia. Around 40 percent of banana plants in the country were reported to be affected by 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120106.1001287) and spread of blood disease from Indonesia was suspected (ProMED-mail post 20090727.2643). With the molecular identification of moko in the country this seems less likely, but the simultaneous occurrence of both pathogens cannot be excluded.
