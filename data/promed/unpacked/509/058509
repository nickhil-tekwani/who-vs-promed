Department of Health has called an urgent press conference on Tuesday
[13 Jan 2009] to issue a dengue update. The department has done this
following the hundreds of calls that have come into Health, after
media reports of a 53-year-old woman who died of dengue [virus infection].

According to Trevor Gellecum, Director of Health, it is still not
clear that this woman indeed died of dengue. "First, certain tests
can be carried out, and it will be 3 weeks before the results could
be known," says Van Gellecum. "These tests should be carried out in a
laboratory abroad."

According to Wilmer Salazar, microbiologist at Health, the woman had
a fever at the weekend, but on Monday [12 Jan 2009] she felt better
and she went to work. "Later that day, she was admitted to the
hospital in shock. At night she died, "said Salazar. "Until now,
there is no confirmed diagnosis of the cause of death, but dengue is
suspected. Today [14 Jan 2009], an autopsy was performed so that the
tests to be done abroad can take place."

Maribel Tromp, manager at the department of epidemiology and research
of the Infectious Disease Service, has indicated that so far 612
suspected cases of dengue have been registered. "Of these, 218 cases
[have been] confirmed as positive by the laboratory, and 394 are
still under investigation, reports Tromp. "This does not mean that
they are negative" [The dates over which these cases occurred are not
specified. - Mod.TY].

From the moment the news of a potentially fatal dengue victim arose
lately, Charline Koolma, director of the Yellow Fever Fight Unit
(GKMB), indicated that they have been overwhelmed with calls from
people reporting family members possibly with dengue-like symptoms or
who want information about the disease. "It is good that we now
receive phone calls, although it also had previously been possible.
These kinds of extreme cases can be avoided," according Koolman.

"From November last year [2008], the GKMB made several visits to
monitor presence of [the dengue virus vector mosquito _Aedes_]
breeding sites and adult mosquitoes. Often, the residents are not
home, and then a letter was left with an invitation to make contact
with the GKMB for the transmission of important information. But
there is never a return call until something bad happens, and then it
is often too late."

The more information and reports the GKMB gets, the better the
service and their work, said Tromp. Finally, all speakers [at the
press conference] called on the population and general practitioners
to join forces against breeding of the _Aedes_ dengue vector
mosquito. Health officials indicated that is the only way to avoid
[virus] infection and prevent dengue.

[2] Mexico (Tamaulipas), suspected
Date: Thu 15 Jan 2009

Health authorities called a meeting to deal with fear that a dengue
outbreak was occurring. Just 2 weeks into the new year [2009], the
health sector has detected 35 suspected [dengue] cases. There are 19
neighborhoods in the southern zone at high risk [of dengue].

Thursday morning [15 Jan 2009], the Health authorities held a meeting
with personnel from the southern zone to reinforce actions to combat
dengue in 8 neighborhoods in Tampico, 8 in Madero and 2 in Altamira,
where the suspected dengue cases have occurred. According to Ernesto
Lavin, in charge of the unit, the presence of the [dengue virus]
mosquito vector has increased in the 1st months [weeks?] of January
2009, due to prevalence of hot weather, which favors its reproduction.

He said that tests on the 35 people who had symptoms of the disease
are being done, and the results are awaited.

The southern zone of Tamaulipas is the main [focus] with the greatest
incidence of officially recognized dengue cases. Again, as in 2007,
the municipalities of Tampico, Madero and Altamira had 50 percent of
the ill individuals. That situation is attributed to migratory
movement, high humidity, which has occurred this year [2009], and
natural wetlands in which there are places bordering lake systems,
where there is risk and conditions appropriate for [dengue vector
mosquito] proliferation. [This last statement is not correct. _Aedes_
mosquitoes that transmit dengue virus do not breed in natural
wetlands, rather in water catchments in and immediately around
buildings, as indicated below. - Mod.TY]

Alfredo Rodriguez Trujillo, epidemiologist with the state Secretariat
of Health, said that they have been working closely in the 43
Tamaulipas municipalities, where they have exhorted the populace to
undertake action to combat dengue by means of cleaning up homes,
avoiding accumulation of rain water in containers, which is where the
dengue mosquito vector reproduces.

He explained that during 2008, Tamaulipas recorded a reduction in the
numbers of dengue cases of almost 50 percent, having detected just
1100 who suffered [dengue], in comparison with the previous year
[2007], when more than 2000 cases of this [potentially] fatal disease occurred.

The Lambayeque Regional Health Directorate (DIRESA) in coordination
with the Illimo municipal district, is evaluating the initiation of
fumigation of dwellings in this locality in which 2 confirmed
non-fatal dengue cases occurred.

Victor Echeandia Arellano, the official in charge of this DIRESA,
stated that the _Aedes_ index (number of vector mosquitoes per house)
is high, necessitating that they proceed with fumigation, such as was
done a year ago in Olmos district.

They have begun a community educational effort in order to prevent
spread of this disease that is worrying local authorities, he added.

It is worth noting that in the Illimo locality, they are carrying out
an aggressive campaign using abate, which is an [_Aedes_] larvacide
which eliminates the eggs [sic] of _Aedes aegypti_, which causes
[transmits] dengue [virus].

An outbreak of dengue fever reached the city of Jequie, located in
the south of Bahia state, 365 km [226 mi] from Salvador. According
Stela Santos Souza, Secretary of Health of the city, just in the 1st
16 days of 2009, there were 787 reported cases of the disease. Of
these, 266 have been [laboratory] confirmed. The cases that have not
yet been confirmed are being analyzed by the municipal Secretariat of
Health and depend on results of serological tests.

This [current number of dengue cases] is 18 percent more cases
compared with 2007.

"The figures are alarming, especially because the vast majority of
the cases have reached the vicinity of the Juaquirumao neighborhood
in the periphery of the city. It is curious that last year [2008],
there were scarcely any cases in this neighborhood," underscored the Secretary.

A medical team from the Ministry of Health coordinated by Dr. Agnaldo
Rico indicated that a boy of 7 years is a suspected dengue victim who
died of DHF. Another 2 cases that were being investigated were
negative by serological tests.

According to the Ministry of Health, the outbreak of dengue in Jequie
has 2 sources: the heavy rains that hit the city in November [2008]
after a period of drought (which increased the rate of illegal
storage of water) combined with the neglect of the population in
preventing it [creation of _Aedes_ breeding sites].

"The secretary of health carried out educational actions in
districts, but the population needs to collaborate [more]," the
secretary stressed.

Besides Jequie, other municipalities of the south center are affected
by dengue (Jaguaquara, Mucuge, Manoel Vitorino and Ipiau). However,
there is still no confirmation that they are having an outbreak of the disease.

Salvador has a high risk of dengue. Around 3600 cases were registered
in the capital in 2008, an increase of 65 percent in relation to
2007. The places most affected were the districts of the Peninsula de
Itapagipe and Suburbio Ferroviario.

In 2008, the household index of [_Aedes_] infestation (IIP) was 3.4
in the city, with the Uruguay neighborhood reaching the alarming
number of 7.0, which means that for each 100 properties visited, 7
had [_Aedes_] mosquito larvae. The situation is considered high risk
[for dengue virus transmission], with an IIP of 3.9 [or above]. In
2007, the index in the whole city was 4.6.

The city of Salvador announced this Tuesday [13 Jan 2009] the
creation of a contingency plan to prevent a dengue epidemic of the
disease during the summer.

In 2008, according to the State Secretariat of Health of Bahia, 35
972 cases of dengue were registered in the Bahia municipalities. Of
these, 14 people died.

The government has declared a dengue health emergency in the
departments [state or province equivalent - Mod.TY] of Santa Cruz,
Beni, Pando and Cochabamba due to the appearance of at least 250
dengue cases so far this year [2009].

The Director of Epidemiology, Juan Carlos Arraya, said that the
regions affected by the disease [virus], transmitted by a mosquito,
are Villa Tunari in Cochabamba; Riberalta in Beni; Cobija in Pando
and the city of Santa Cruz. He pointed out that 80 percent of the
cases, which are not necessarily all of them because people who have
symptoms do not go to health centers, are found in Santa Cruz.

The official indicated that during the past season [2008], 2000
laboratory confirmed dengue cases were attended to, with 11 of DHF, 9
of which were detected in Santa Cruz and 2 in Pando.

The [health] authority explained that the declaration of a health
emergency assumes a coordinated effort everywhere in order to avoid
this disease, which can cause deaths.

Among the expected activities are fumigation of [mosquito] infested
places, elimination of [_Aedes_ mosquito] breeding sites, and
provision of clean water to families that live in these areas, among others.

A fundamental part of this effort will be the armed forces, 14 800 of
whom will be working during this emergency and will provide vehicles,
and, in some cases, their own fumigation and dengue control equipment.

The emergency will last for 3 months, the time that corresponds to
the rainy season in the country, which is exactly the time of
increase of the disease.

Among the other designated measures to stop this disease, which
particularly attacks the poorest regions because they lack basic
services and hygiene, is a long-term strategy (2008-2013) the object
of which is to maintain the DHF mortality level at 0 and the levels
of household infestation at less than 5 percent. [Note: this may not
be adequate to prevent dengue virus transmission. See the Brazil
item, above. - Mod.TY]

The Minister of Health, Ramiro Tapia, pointed out the declaration of
emergency requires that all the hospitals and medical and health
centers attend [to patients] to the maximum of their capability.

Paraguay health officials have assigned a team to investigate a
dengue outbreak in the Yvy Ya'u area of Concepcion department. In
this area, there are various people who have a clinical picture that
is compatible with dengue. As well, various _Aedes aegypti_
reservoirs [vectors] that transmit dengue [virus] have been found.

To date, 6 [laboratory] confirmed cases of the disease have been
found, with 104 suspected [cases] and 78 [possible cases] discarded.
In the fight against dengue, the populace has an obligation to combat
the mosquito vector by eliminating breeding sites.

According to the [news] bulletin issued following the meeting in the
situation room, the team assigned to investigate the dengue outbreak
in Yvy Ya'u presented the following situation: In that locality,
various people were found who were convalescent with clinical signs
compatible with dengue [virus infection] who had consulted with
[health workers] in the private sector, and people with acutely
febrile illnesses with a diagnosis compatible [with dengue] who were
self-medicated. The earliest case was found during the visit of 23 Dec [2008].

The dengue fever outbreak in the Bone Regency, South Sulawesi, on
Friday [9 Jan 2009] was designated by the Kesehatan local [health]
service as an extraordinary incident [emergency]. The data of the
Health Service showed hundreds of residents, including children, had
become casualties of the [dengue virus transmitted by] _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito bite. Moreover, 3 children under 5 years old died.

In the meantime, the number of dengue fever patients in the
Tenriawaru Hospital continued to increase, not only in the rooms of
the wards, but the hospital corridor was then filled by dengue fever patients.

At least 17 subdistricts in the Bone Regency are affected by dengue
fever illness. The most serious subdistricts were Lappariaja,
Cenrana, Dua Boccoe, Tellu Siattinge, and Barebbo.

During the period 1 Jan 2008 through 6 Jan 2009 there were a total of
1419 cases reported of which 488 tested positive for [dengue
infection. In the period since the "summer" (week 24), there were
1140 cases reported of which 464 tested positive [for dengue infection].

Given considerable locally transmitted dengue virus in 2008, it is
likely that there is a risk of imported dengue virus initiating
ongoing, local transmission in 2009.

Health authorities in New Caledonia are concerned about the
development of the dengue epidemic, with nearly 100 new patients
since the beginning of January [2009], as reported Tuesday [13 Jan 2009].

"We have 91 cases since the beginning of the year [2009]. The
situation is worrying, and we think it will get worse given the
weather," said AFP Aurelie Guigon, head of virology at the Institut Pasteur.

The weather has been warm and very wet currently in New Caledonia,
promoting the development of the mosquitoes that are the main vehicle
of transmission of the disease [virus].

In addition to the weather, the recent appearance in the archipelago
of dengue type 4 [virus] is another cause for concern.

"There are now 2 dengue virus serotypes: Type 1, which is usual here,
and type 4 against which the Caledonians are not immune. There is no
cross-immunity with dengue; the risk is doubled," Guigon also indicated.

In 2008, 1135 cases of dengue were reported, with a surge in the
epidemic around February-March 2008 and a fatal case in October 2008.
Last year [2008], over the 1st 15 days of January, there were only 5 cases.

"We need a little more background, but the issue of endemism
[endemnicity?] of dengue in New Caledonia arises," said Aureie Guigon.

The authorities have recommended that the population destroy all
mosquito breeding places, such as under plant pots or in children's
toys in the garden, and to use regular insect repellant lotions.

With each report of a case, the area surrounding the houses of the
sick are sprayed with insecticides, but spraying massively and
constantly has led to resistance of mosquitoes beginning in 2003.

Poorly equipped, small inland municipalities do not always follow
this procedure.
