A possible outbreak of Bovine tuberculosis [bTB], is suspected in the Muresa parish of A Balsa. If this outbreak is laboratory-confirmed, 24 cows will have to be slaughtered next week and this will become the 2nd event at this location. The previous outbreak of bTB was recorded in 2019, affecting cattle that shared pasture in the area, and led to the monitoring of more than 700 cattle from some 20 farms, of which 30 had to be culled.

"Tests have been recently carried out, with 24 cows showing suspected tuberculin skin test results so they will be slaughtered in the slaughterhouse next week", the mayor of Murés, Manuel Requeijo, who has proposed an urgent motion to declare the area as severely affected, confirmed Thursday [24 Feb 2022].

"This new resurgence has the livestock sector in the area very concerned about the damage caused by a new immobilization [animal movement restrictions] of farms, the main problem being economic losses and market distrust. They can not believe that this is happening in the same area, when less than a week ago, José Balseiros, General Director of Livestock, Agriculture and Agri-Food Industries of Galicia, announced the declaration of Galicia as free of bovine tuberculosis," adds the mayor.

The Murés Council asks the Junta to declare the area an emergency zone.

A Balsa is situated in Galicia, an autonomous community in Spain's northwest; a map can be seen at https://www.google.co.il/maps/search/A+Balsa,+Galicia/@42.9873231,-11.8087621,6z?hl=en.

In Spain, despite years of efforts to eradicate bovine tuberculosis, the disease is still endemic; in some of its 17 autonomous communities, high bTB prevalence has been continuously reported. Galicia is one of the areas presenting a low bTB prevalence.

Details on the following steps undertaken in the described outbreak are expected. In case the slaughter is carried out, post-slaughter findings and laboratory results would be appreciated. - Mod.AS
