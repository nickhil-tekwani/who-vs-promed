Carlos Galvez, National Director of Health of MINSA (Ministry of Health), explained to Telemetro that so far this year [2014], 5 cases and one death [from hantavirus infections] have been registered.

He explained that the cases have been reported in Las Tablas and Tonosi of Los Santos province and in other areas of the Azuero [Peninsula].

MINSA has emphasized that one of the main prevention measures for this disease is cleaning up of grain storage areas, since these are the areas sought by rats, the transmitters of [Choclo] hantavirus. MINSA has developed a program in which they have given plastic tanks to producers for storage of their grain, since sacks are chewed into by rodents that contaminate the grain [with virus contaminated excreta] that is later ingested by humans.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infections in the Azuero Peninsula (Herrera, Los Santos, and Veraguas provinces) of Panama, has increased from 2 reported on 19 Jan 2014 in Herrera and Los Santos provinces (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140121.2220063), to 5 currently reported above. The Azuero Peninsula is where the majority of the HPS cases have been found.

Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
