Mass poultry slaughter in Siberian villages
-----------------------------------------------
Health authorities in neighboring provinces of Russia and Kazakhstan
set about slaughtering poultry yesterday [1 Aug 2005] amid signs that
the deadly bird flu virus was steadily spreading westwards from
China, officials said. The chief sanitary doctor of the Siberian
province of Novosibirsk said that slaughtering of poultry would begin
today in 13 villages where avian flu had been detected, the H5N1
sub-type that can be transmitted to humans.
"The destruction will begin on 2 Aug 2005. Measures are being worked
out to compensate the birds' owners," Valery Mikheyev was quoted by
Itar-Tass news agency as saying. He played down the danger to people
living in the villages where the virus had been found.
"The state of health of the inhabitants of these areas gives no cause
for alarm," Mikheyev said. "Up to 6000 people are being checked per
day," he said.
In the neighboring Kazakh province of Pavlodar, meanwhile, officials
said they had slaughtered 2350 geese and 250 ducks, after some 600
poultry at a farm died from bird flu starting on 20 Jul 2005, the
Kazakh Sanitary and Epidemiological Agency said [see commentary].
Tests were under way to determine whether the cases in Kazakhstan
were of the H5N1 type.
So far, cases of H5N1 around the world have mainly been transmitted
between animals. But it has killed more than 60 people in Southeast
Asia since 2003, including in Viet Nam, Thailand, Cambodia and
Indonesia. The arrival of the virus in Russia was greeted with alarm
in some communities, amid expectations that bird flu could spread to
more densely populated western Russia.
The Kommersant newspaper reported that one poultry company in the
western Siberian province of Orenburg was preparing to shoot down
migratory birds flying over its territory. "The most dangerous thing
is that from Kazakhstan the route of migratory birds goes through the
European part of Russia where the poultry industry is concentrated,"
Kommersant quoted the company's director, Nikolai Khaustov, as
saying. "We have already distributed cartridges to volunteers who
will fire at all birds flying towards our factory. The situation is
alarming," Khaustov said.

65 000 domestic birds to be destroyed in Novosibirsk region over flu
-----------------------------------------------
About 65 000 domestic birds will be destroyed in 13 settlements of
Russia's Novosibirsk region, where quarantine was introduced over
bird flu, the deputy governor of the region told a press conference
on Tuesday [2 Aug 2005].
Although the number of fowl killed by bird flu has declined over the
past few days, a decision was reached to destroy all household
poultry and pay compensation to the population, Viktor Gergert said.
Almost 9 million rubles [USD 315 000] have been earmarked for that
from the regional budget.
So far, no cases of humans being infected with bird flu have been
registered in the Novosibirsk region, sources from the regional
headquarters set up to tackle the problem have said.

Bird flu rages on the border of Kazakhstan and Russia
-----------------------------------------------
The Berdyuzhskii district in Tyumen oblast, bordering on Kazakhstan,
is under quarantine due to a "flu bird" outbreak, our correspondent
reports.
Official authorities are not commenting. According to unofficial
data, the veterinary administration of the Tyumen oblast government
has begun large scale inspection of all poultry plants.

Illegal bird trade may be contributing to spread of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
The rapid spread of the deadly Asian bird flu virus is sparking
concerns about the effectiveness of the international containment
protocol.
The highly contagious strain of avian flu has now turned up in
poultry stocks in Siberia and Kazakhstan, and some health authorities
say it's only a matter of time before the disease hits European Union
countries.
Russian doctors have been quick to blame migratory birds flying in
from infected regions of China. But bird experts say an illegal trade
in poultry cannot be ruled out as the source of the latest outbreak.
In a bid to halt the spread of bird flu, all domestic birds in a
western Siberian region will be slaughtered today [2 Aug 2005].
That's thousands of geese, chickens and ducks from more than a dozen
villages.
Just over the border in Kazakhstan, the cull has been underway for
days, and a bird transport ban has been imposed on the affected areas.
The virus was 1st detected 2 weeks ago in the area, and the World
Health Organization has still yet to confirm that it is the highly
contagious strain of the virus, H5N1.

[In their notification on HPAI to the OIE, 24 Jul 2005, the Russian
authorities indicated as follows: "The hemagglutinin subtype has been
preliminarily identified (from pathological material) as H5. After
confirmation by virus isolation, a separate notification will be
sent. Tests are being performed to determine the neuraminidase type."
Rather puzzling: so far there is still no official information about
the N (neuraminidase) serotyping of the H5 virus strain involved in
outbreaks in Russia, H5N1 remaining "suspected." And, in spite of
repeated newswires about a human case and about outbreaks in poultry,
there has been no official response at all from neighboring
Kazakhstan.
There are rumors about the northwestward spread of the disease in
Siberia from Novosibirsk to the oblasts (regions, administrative and
territorial divisions) Omsk and Tyumen (Tioumen); further information
and an official update are urgently needed.
