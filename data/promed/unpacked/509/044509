Japan fears imported dumplings were poisoned
-------------------------------------------------
Fears have increased in Japan that a batch of dumplings imported from
China had been deliberately poisoned, after the tainted food was
found to contain a 2nd toxic pesticide.

Feelings have been running high in Japan since Japanese health
minister Yoichi Masuzoe claimed on Tuesday [5 Feb 2008] that "gyoza"
dumplings contaminated with the pesticide methamidophos had been
deliberately tampered with and that police are treating it as an
attempted murder case.

Tests yesterday showed that the pesticide dichlorvos was found in
dough and fillings used to make the dumplings. To date, several
hundred Japanese have visited hospitals complaining of nausea and
diarrhoea, with one 10-year-old girl in a serious condition after
eating the dumplings.

Wei Chuanzhong, the Chinese vice minister of the General
Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine,
admitted that "a small group that does not wish for the development
of Sino-Japanese friendship may have taken extreme measures."

The likelihood of the pesticides being added at the factory in Hebei
Province that has been the focus of the joint investigation was
"extremely small," both sides have agreed, and it is not clear
whether the pesticides were added in China or after they were
imported to Japan.

The crisis has led to Nissin Food Products withdrawing from a planned
merger with the Chinese unit of Japan Tobacco Inc, while chat rooms
and editorials in both China and Japan have been inundated with
claims and counter-claim of conspiracy between 2 countries that have
a long history of regional rivalry.

Both Tokyo and Beijing have called for the rhetoric to be toned down
and for the public to await the results of the ongoing inquiry before
blame is apportioned.

People said they fell ill and vomited after eating dumplings
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese dumplings which were laced with pesticide and made at least
10 Japanese people ill were probably poisoned on purpose, Japan's
health minister says. The frozen dumplings were contaminated with a
highly toxic organophoshate pesticide methamidophos.

"Judging from the circumstantial evidence, we'd have to think that
it's highly likely to be a crime," Yoichi Masuzoe told reporters.

The issue has triggered intensive media coverage and public alarm in
Japan. Japanese police say they want to work with their Chinese
counterparts to investigate how the dumplings, known as gyoza in
Japan, were poisoned.

Safety scares
-----------
The problem emerged last Wednesday [6 Feb 2008], when 10 people were
reported to have fallen ill from the dumplings -- thin dough packets
containing ground meat and vegetables which are then fried. The
dosage of pesticide was sufficiently concentrated to leave one
5-year-old girl seriously ill. By late Thursday [7 Feb 2008] there
were unconfirmed reports of dozens of other cases.

The Japanese distributor, JT Foods, quickly recalled the dumplings
and other products made by the same Chinese company, Tianyang Food.
But China says preliminary tests on 2 batches of the dumplings found
them to be safe.

The 2 countries have not yet ratified an agreement to allow
investigators to travel between them though so any contacts will be
made through diplomatic channels. In the meantime the Japanese will
try to rule out the possibility that the dumplings were poisoned in
Japan after they had been brought in from China.

In recent months, Chinese-made products have been involved in several
safety scares. But Japan has also had its problems. Last year,
confectioners admitted to mislabelling expiry dates on biscuits and rice cakes.

[There are 2 different chemicals mentioned in these 2 articles. Both
articles mention methamidophos but the 1st article mentions
dichlorvos. At the least it appears there are 2 chemicals involved.

Dichlorvos (2,2-dichclorovinyl dimethyl phosphate) is a dense
colorless liquid used as an insecticide. It has a sweetish smell and
readily mixes with water. Dichlorvos used in pest control is diluted
with other chemicals and used as a spray. It can also be incorporated
into plastic that slowly releases the chemical.

Dichlorvos is used for insect control in food storage areas, green
houses, and barns, and control of insects on livestock. It is not
generally used on outdoor crops. Dichlorvos is sometimes used for
insect control in workplaces and in the home. Veterinarians use it to
control parasites on pets.

The general population is not likely to be exposed to dichlorvos. It
has been found on some fruits, vegetables, and grain, but washing and
processing destroys the dichlorvos. People who live near a hazardous
waste site containing dichlorvos could be exposed by breathing
contaminated air or touching contaminated soil. Workers who
manufacture the chemical or use it are likely to be exposed. People
whose homes have been sprayed with dichlorvos could be exposed by
breathing contaminated air or touching surfaces where dichlorvos was applied.

The major effect of dichlorvos is on the nervous system. Studies on
people who were exposed to dichlorvos by breathing air in the
workplace containing low levels of dichlorvos have not shown any
harmful effects. Animal studies have shown that breathing high levels
can cause nervous system effects.

Ingesting large doses may cause nausea and vomiting, restlessness,
sweating, and muscle tremors, while very large doses may cause coma,
inability to breathe, and death. Animal studies have also shown
effects on the nervous system when animals drank water or ate food
containing dichlorvos.

It is not known whether dichlorvos can affect reproduction or cause
birth defects in people. Animal studies have not reported effects on
reproduction or birth defects when animals were exposed to dichlorvos.

It is not known whether dichlorvos causes cancer in people. A study
in rats and mice reported that rats had an increase in cancer of the
pancreas and in leukemia, and female mice had an increase in stomach
cancer after they were fed dichlorvos for 2 years.

Dichlorvos is probably a human carcinogen. There is a general test
that can be used to determine if you have been exposed to a group of
insecticides, including dichlorvos. This test measures the activity
of an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase in the blood. However, it
does not specifically show exposure to dichlorvos.

Specific tests are available to identify dichlorvos or its breakdown
products in urine. These tests aren't available at most doctors'
offices, but can be done at special laboratories that have the right equipment.

Methamidophos has a number of other names including Monitor, Nitofol,
Tamaron, Swipe, Nuratron, Vetaron, Filitox, Patrole, Tamanox, SRA
5172, and Tam (1, 2). Methamidophos is also a breakdown product of
the organophosphate insecticide acephate (Orthene) (3, 4).

Tolerances for residues of methamidophos on raw agricultural products
range from 0.5 ppm in or on melons to 1.0 ppm in or on broccoli and tomatoes.

Methamidophos is a highly active, systemic, residual organophosphate
insecticide/acaricide/avicide with contact and stomach action. Its
mode of action in insects and mammals is by decreasing the activity
of an enzyme important for nervous system function called
acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is essential in the normal
transmission of nerve impulses. Methamidophos is a potent
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (5).

It is effective against chewing and sucking insects and is used to
control aphids, flea beetles, worms, whiteflies, thrips, cabbage
loopers, Colorado potato beetles, potato tubeworms, armyworms, mites,
leafhoppers, and many others. Crop uses include broccoli, Brussel
sprouts, cauliflower, grapes, celery, sugar beets, cotton, tobacco,
and potatoes. It is used abroad for many vegetables, hops, corn,
peaches, and other crops (6). Commercially available formulations
include soluble concentrate, emulsifiable concentrate, wettable
powder, granules, ultra-low volume spray and water miscible spray
concentrate (4).

Generally, methamidophos is not considered phytotoxic if used as
directed, but defoliation has occurred when applied as foliar spray
to deciduous fruit. It is compatible with many other pesticides, but
do not use with alkaline materials (4). Methamidophos is slightly
corrosive to mild steel and copper alloys. This compound is highly
toxic to mammals, birds, and bees. Do not graze treated areas, and be
sure to wear protective clothing including respirator, chemical
goggles, rubber gloves, and impervious protective clothing (1, 2).

Early symptoms of acute organo-phosphate poisoning are dependent on
route of exposure, and usually develop during or shortly after
exposure (within 12 hours) (9). If inhaled, tightness in the chest,
wheezing, headache, blurred vision, pinpoint pupils, tearing and
runny nose are common early symptoms. If ingested, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and cramps are the most common early signs of poisoning.
Sweating and twitching in the area of absorption are seen with skin
exposure. Weakness, shakiness, blurred vision, tightness in the
chest, sweating, confusion, changes in heart rate, convulsions, coma,
and cessation of breathing may occur with significant inhalation,
ingestion or dermal exposure (9). An intermediate syndrome has been
described in cases of poisonings in Sri Lanka, where patients
experienced paralysis of limb, neck, and respiratory muscles 24-96
hours after exposure. Delayed neurological problems (delayed
peripheral neuropathy) have been described 2-4 weeks after large
exposures to organophosphates, and include a loss of feeling and pins
and needles type of pains in the feet, legs, and hands (10, 11).
Atropine is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning (9).

People with high blood pressure, gastrointestinal disorders, heart,
liver, lung, or nervous system problems may be more sensitive to methamidophos.

A 2-generation feeding study in rats showed a decrease in the
percentage of females delivering offspring at all dose levels (0.15,
0.5, and 1.65 mg/kg/day). A systemic NOEL was 0.5 mg/kg/day based on
reduced body weights during premating period (13). In humans, reduced
sperm count and sperm viability were seen in men who were exposed to
the product Tamaron in China.

Some fetal liver pathologic changes were observed when pregnant
rabbits were exposed to methamidophos (14). In 2 teratology studies,
no birth defects were observed at the highest levels tested (3
mg/kg/day in rats, and 2.5 mg/kg/day in rabbits). Decreased body
weights were observed in offspring and mothers in the rat study at 3
mg/kg/day. In rabbits, a maternal low effect level (LEL) of 0.1
mg/kg/day (lowest dose tested) was observed based on low body weights (12).

Methamidophos has tested positive for genotoxicity, or ability to
induce changes in chromosomes, in some tests and negative in others.
It may be weakly mutagenic (12).

There is no evidence of carcinogenicity in tests with rats and mice.

The primary target of organophosphate compounds is the nervous
system. Some liver damage has been observed in rabbits. Reduced sperm
count and reduced sperm viability have been observed in humans.

Methamidophos is rapidly absorbed through the stomach, lungs and
skin. It is eliminated primarily in the urine.
