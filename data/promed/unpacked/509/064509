Zimbabwe foot-and-mouth outbreak spreads south
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Zimbabwe has spread south
from Bulawayo to the Beitbridge district bordering South Africa, an
industry official said. "We have investigated and confirmed there has been
FMD infection in the Jepempe resettlement area of Beitbridge," Stuart
Hargreaves, director of the government's Department of Veterinary Services
said.
The report said quarantine officers had moved to the vast Gonarezhou
national wildlife park in southeastern Zimbabwe, suspected to have to been
the source of the outbreak of the disease last week.
The Zimbabwe Cattle Producers' Association (ZCPA) says the country would
combat the outbreak -- first detected at a feedlot near Bulawayo in the
mainly ranching province of Matabeleland -- with vaccines and tight
controls on livestock movement, avoiding a mass cull of cattle.
The disease forced the country to suspend beef exports. The state-owned
Cold Storage Company, Zimbabwe's sole beef exporting body, has an annual
export quota of 9 100 tons worth 2 billion Zimbabwe dollars ($36 million)
to the European Union and 5,000 tons to South Africa.
The veterinary department says it has the capacity and resources to contain
the outbreak. Hargreaves said the United Nations Food and Agricultural
Organization had also pledged emergency assistance.
Industry officials say Zimbabwe's communal farmers' cattle herd numbers
about 4.5 million animals while the commercial herd is estimated at 1.2
million.
