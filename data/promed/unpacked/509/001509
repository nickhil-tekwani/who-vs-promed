Sugarcane crops in Australia are being affected by the outbreak of orange
rust disease, which has significantly reduced yields from the main
Queensland sugar variety Q124. [Moreover, crops are also affected by rat
infestation.] In response, the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES)
has established a special taskforce to fight the disease, as well as
joining with the Cane Protection and Productivity Boards and mill and grower
representatives to work together to formulate local strategies to combat
orange rust.
Australian sugar production is forecast to fall by 24 per cent to [about]
4.2 million tonnes in 2000/01 [and exports will likely be reduced] by 25
per cent to 3.1 million tonnes.
Heavy rains that fell in Australia recently will not affect the current
crops, but are set to affect production over the next few years. Prolonged
waterlogging and washouts will force farmers to replant cane, particularly
in the Mackay region, which will have a devastating effect in light of
increased planting in the spring.
Approximately 85 per cent of the raw sugar produced in Australia is
exported, which is a large proportion when compared to most sugar-producing
companies. The remaining 15 per cent of raw sugar produced is refined for
domestic use and export. Major export markets are Canada, Japan, Malaysia,
Republic of Korea, China, New Zealand, USA and Taiwan, with Asia accounting
for about 65 per cent of total exports.
Sugarcane is grown from Mossman and the Atherton Tableland in North
Queensland down the east coast to Grafton, North New South Wales, and in
the Ord River region in Western Australia. Approximately 94 per cent of
Australia's total sugar supply is grown in Queensland, 5 per cent in New
South Wales and 0.7 per cent in Western Australia
There are over 545 000 hectares in Australia devoted to cane[-] growing. In
Queensland alone, 508 000 hectares are dedicated to sugarcane, which is a
40 per cent increase since 1988.

[Orange rust disease of sugarcane is caused by _Puccinia kuehnii_ and is
distinct from common rust disease of sugar cane which is caused by _P.
melanocephala_ (=_P.erianthi_). According to information published in
"Rust rap", an Australian publication co-sponsored by the Bureau of Sugar
Experiment Stations, Nufarm, and Bayer, the outbreak of orange rust is due
to the appearance of a new race of _P. kuehnii_ in Queensland. The disease
has been present in the state for over a 100 years but it rarely causes
significant economic crop loss. Because it is a relatively minor crop,
little research has been done on the disease. Pustules of orange rust are
orange while those of common rust are brown. Leaf lesions tend to be
grouped in clusters while those of common rust are distributed evenly on
the leaf. Orange rust occurs in summer and autumn and is favored by humid
conditions while common rust occurs in spring and early summer. Rain tends
to favor orange rust development but development of common rust is
inhibited by rain. Fungicides may provide possible control of the disease
in remaining Q124 crops until new resistant cultivars can be phased into
the cane production system. - Mod.DH]
