Norway eyes imported food, travel in rare Salmonella outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Norway, where _Salmonella_ bacteria is rare in domestic livestock and locally-produced food, is experiencing its first outbreak of salmonellosis since 2013. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) has not been able to identify the source of the _Salmonella_ that has recently infected at least 7 people. All 7 report eating at the Joe & The Juice restaurant at the Oslo Airport recently while traveling.

Joe & The Juice, a Danish-born juice bar and coffee shop once found mostly in European airports, is opening locations in 2017 from San Francisco to Chicago.

NIPH is monitoring the outbreak to determine if it will be limited to the existing cases or if it will grow larger. The same DNA "fingerprint" for _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium bacterium has been confirmed in all 7 victims, suggesting a common source. While the same airport restaurant connects the sickened individuals, their residences are disconnected, scattered throughout the country. The NIPH investigation began in August when the victims began experiencing diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain.

Norway sees only about 1200 to 2000 salmonellosis illnesses annually. About 70 percent of those are from infections contracted outside of the country. Most of the other infections are from imported foods. Food produced in Norway and Norwegian livestock are rarely sources of _Salmonella_ contamination. Some strains of the bacterium have become established among wild Norwegian fauna, particularly among small birds and hedgehogs. Every year, these _Salmonella_ strains do cause instances of disease in humans. However, a nationwide salmonellosis outbreak in Norway in 2013 involved the serotype Coeln, sickening 26 people from age 2 to 81. A pre-cut salad mix was determined to be the likely cause of that outbreak.

More international travel and more imported foods are combining to keep salmonellosis as the second most common diarrheal disease in Norway.

[As reported by one of the EpiCore Global Surveillance participants recently, a common restaurant appears to be linking the recent cases of salmonellosis in Norway although the specific vehicle for transmission is not clear at this point.

Pre-harvest control of _Salmonella_ in food producing animals as well as control of imported food is the major reason for the low prevalence (in primary production) and incidence (in humans) in Sweden, Norway, and Finland. - Mod.LL
