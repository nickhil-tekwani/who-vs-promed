Dropsy has spread in Gujarat, in western part of India. There are 14 cases
in Sabarkantha district. One Ankur Oil company is sealed. Suspect oil
mixing. All the 14 cases admitted to Ahmedabad, Civil Hospital, created
special ward for dropsy patients. The civil supply department has collected
250 samples of oil from various places to check mixing.
I am trying to send some more information to the Government of Gujarat. If
you have [information regarding the precautions and treatment please send
it to me.
