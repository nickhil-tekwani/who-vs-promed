[This immediate notification from Senegal complements the information already published in ProMED-mail posting 20210201.8155983.

HPAI viruses emerged in western Africa in 2006 and reemerged in 2015. No outbreaks of HPAI had been reported in Senegal until very recently (end of 2020; ProMED posting 20210108.8085504), when an outbreak in a poultry farm due to H5N1 was documented 200 km [124 mi] south of Djoudj bird sanctuary. This is the 1st report in the neighboring Mauritania. The temporal and spatial correlation between these 2 outbreaks strongly suggests they might be linked. - Mod.PMB]
