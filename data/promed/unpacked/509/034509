Costa Rica declared a state of phytosanitary emergency in a clear escalation of its struggle to protect its banana industry from Fusarium wilt TR4. The decree enables the State Phytosanitary Service to combat new or existing pests that may cause damage to national agriculture.

The 1st Latin American cases of Fusarium wilt TR4 were detected last year [2019] in Colombia [ProMED-mail post 20190820.6630576]. The pathogen is not yet present in Costa Rica. The funds will be allocated to intensify continuous surveillance activities in the plantations of musaceae (banana and plantain).

"A country-wide effort is required, "said the National Banana Corporation. With 4 of the world's top 5 banana exporters [located] in Latin America, the potential impact of TR4 on the region's banana business is considerable. The only preventive measure currently available is quarantine, preventing the transfer of affected soil or plant material from infected areas to Fusarium TR4-free areas.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ (previously f. sp. _cubense_). Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently, crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED-mail post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist, varying in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4 (TR4), as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510), have emerged since from Asia and Oceania.

In recent years, TR4 has been reported in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (most recently from India, see link below). The recent detection in Colombia (ProMED-mail posts 20190820.6630576 and 20190712.6564489) was the 1st confirmed report of TR4 in the Americas. TR4 is of great concern worldwide and development of TR4 resistant cultivars has become a top priority for many national banana industries (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
