Barn cat in Prineville infected by the plague
---------------------------------------------
A barn cat in Prineville, Oregon, is being treated for an infectious
disease associated with the Middle Ages: bubonic plague. Emilio
DeBess, Oregon's public health veterinarian, said the 6-year-old cat,
named Meow, was brought into a veterinarian in Prineville at the end
of May with an abscessed lymph node on its neck and an elevated fever.
The vet, worried about the symptoms, alerted DeBess and sent a sample
of the cat's lymph node to the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at
Oregon State University. Sure enough, Meow had the plague, a disease
that has infected wild animals such as squirrels and rats in New
Mexico, Arizona, California and Colorado but is rarely seen in Oregon
or Washington. The only recent case of a wild animal in Oregon
involved mule deer in Grant County in 2005.

The plague is carried by fleas, which often infect mice and rats but
can bite people and pets as well. DeBess said that since 1995, only 3
people in Oregon have been infected. 2 of those cases -- a mother and
daughter in Lakeview -- got sick last year [2010]. Their dog was
infected as well but the husband was not sick.

Still, those 2 cases grabbed DeBess' attention. "That's a change from
what we've seen in the past," he said. "We're keeping an eye on what's
going on."

The other case involved a woman in Bend in 1995 and her 2 cats. All 3
people recovered. So did the cats and the dog and Meow is also on his
way to a full recovery. Meow's owners did not get sick, DeBess said.

Early detection of the infection and treatment with antibiotics is
critical. Untreated, the plague can be fatal. Cats are especially
susceptible, DeBess said. Although dogs can become infected, they're
what's known as sentinel animals in that they don't show any symptoms.
Plague symptoms usually appear one to 4 days after exposure and
include fever, chills, headache, swollen lymph nodes, abdominal pain
and pneumonia.

DeBess said this latest case should not cause panic but push people
towards prevention. "This is a reminder to use flea treatment and to
watch for illnesses that we might not normally think of," he said.
Check with your vet on the best flea treatments for your pets. People
can guard against flea bites with insect repellent. Additional
measures may be necessary in areas rife with rodents, including
tucking pant cuffs into socks. Obviously, avoid contact with mice and
rats. And if you -- or your pets -- get sick, seek medical help.

[It's that time of year. _Y. pestis_ infections are not uncommon in
domestic cats and dogs up and down the foothills of the Rockies. The
incidence depends on the ability of the animal owners to recognize
that something worth a visit to the veterinarian is worthwhile. And
flea preventative treatments are easy and omni-available. No one wants
a pet to wander into the home and deposit a flea or 2 on the carpet
and bite the kids.
