[For] Ethiopians, the false banana plant widely known as enset is a staple food and, on many occasions, a supplementary source of income. Although varieties of the plant are found in many sub-Saharan countries, only in Ethiopia has it been domesticated. The tree is relatively resistant to climate change and exists in hundreds of varieties.

But it's no longer easy to grow the crop in the southern part of the country, where the plant is threatened by blight. The threat to enset is its high vulnerability to mealy bugs and diseases like bacteria wilt, which dry up its leaves and eventually kill the whole plant.

Ethiopian researchers, in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), have used genetic engineering to produce a modified enset that's resistant to bacteria wilt [see link below]. [But so far], there are no independent studies that show improved yield [or] disease-resistance.

[Enset (_Ensete ventricosum_; also called false or Abyssinian banana, African wild banana) is one of about 25 species in the genus. Mainly young inflorescences and the pulp of pseudostem or roots are eaten, fruits have been described as lacking in flavour, seeds are edible. The plants are also a source of fibre and other materials. Most _Ensete_ species occur in the Old World tropics (Africa, Asia). The genus is one of the total 2 or 3 (currently under debate) in the Musaceae family and its name is derived from the Ethiopian name for banana.

_Xanthomonas vasicola_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to _Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). BXW was originally identified in enset in Ethiopia in 1968 and has been spreading since then. It affects all banana types (_Musa_ species and hybrids), causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence of 70-80 percent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90 percent have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread via infected planting material, insects (possibly including the sap sucking mealy bugs mentioned above), mechanical means, and contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management. Removal of male buds immediately after fruit set has been found to prevent transmission of bacterial ooze by flying insects. Other control measures may include crop rotation, disinfection of orchard tools, use of certified clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and prevent re-introduction or plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen. However, these measures may be difficult to implement with smallholders. No resistant banana cultivars have been identified so far. Research is being carried out on transgenic lines of banana containing capsicum genes for field resistance to BXW.

A number of pathovars of _X. campestris_ with varying host specificity and affecting a range of crops (such as vegetables, fruit trees, cereals) were designated. However, some of these pathovars have now been classified as separate species (see previous ProMED-mail posts on _Xanthomonas_ diseases in the archive).
