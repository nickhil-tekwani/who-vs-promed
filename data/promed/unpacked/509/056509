Beginning in Apr 2003, an unusual number of wound infections with
_Acinetobacter_ were noted in USA soldiers evacuated from Iraq to the USS
Comfort (a hospital ship) or Landstuhl Army Medical Center (in
Germany). The numbers were noteworthy, since the infection was not noted
in the 1991 Gulf War and exceeded historical experience of the
centers. Indeed, the USS Comfort exhausted its supply of imipenem, a
carbapenem antimicrobial used to treat infections with this Gram-negative
bacillus.

The numbers reported in this lecture were Walter Reed Army Medical Center
(Washington, DC)14, Landstuhl Army Medical Center 11, National Naval
Medical Center (Bethesda, MD) 6, and Brooke Army Medical Center (TX) 3, for
a total of 34. 55 percent of the isolates were from wounds, 20 percent
from sputum, 10 percent from tissue, 7 percent from blood, 4 percent from
urine and 2 percent each from catheter tips and drains. 97 percent of the
cases were from action in Iraq, primarily involving the forward troops.

The antimicrobial resistance pattern reported was 2 percent sensitive to no
antimicrobials, 41 percent sensitive to only carbapenems, 26 percent
sensitive to carbapenems and one other antimicrobial class, and 31% another
pattern of sensitivity.

Walter Reed Army Medical Center experience with Iraq warfare associated
_Acinetobacter baumanii_.

37 of 442 (8.4 percent) medical evacuees were culture-positive.

3 cases identified of nosocomial spread of the multiply resistant organism.

[With 37 patients, this report must be later than the first one. It is not
clearly stated how many of the cases were colonized as opposed to infected.

[As was noted in postings below related to the conflict in Iraq a year ago,
polyresistant _Acinetobacter spp._ has been acquired in the field as well
as in nosocomial settings. Infectious disease clinicians even outside the
military and VA settings should be aware of this risk from individuals
returning from active duty.

In my moderation of the previous thread below, I included the following
regarding _Acinetobacter_ infections of wartime injuries (references
renumbered):

Myron Tong reported that _Mimeae-Herellea_ (organisms of which some were
renamed _Acinetobacter_) were the most common Gram-negative bacilli
isolated from wounds on day 1 of hospitalization in the Viet Nam conflict
(1). Aarabi (2) found that _Acinetobacter_ was the 2nd most common cause of
infection of missile-related head wounds in an Iranian report from data
collected during the Iran-Iraq conflict.

primary and secondary exploration of missile head wounds. Neurosurgery
