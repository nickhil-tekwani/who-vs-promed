2. New actions undertaken during the week
-----------------------------------------
- Viet Nam: On 19 Dec 2019, MARD released 3 notices concerning restocking procedure (No. 13/BCĐDTLCP), transport procedure for breeding pigs and well processed pork products (No. 14/BCĐDTLCP), and promoting pig production and biosafety, as well as production [of] other animals, poultry and aquaculture (No. 9523/BNN-TY), and a letter to livestock producers (No. 9524/BNN-TY) recommending the following:
-- Minimize the risk of disease recurrence in accordance with current regulations and No. 13/BCĐDTLCP on restocking;
-- Strict application of biosecurity;
-- Avoid hoarding to ensure price stability;
-- Not be involved in illegal trading of pigs or slaughtered pigs across the Viet Nam border.

- Indonesia: On 19 Dec 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture (MoA) recommended the public to isolate sick animals and equipment, and de-stock pig pens for 2 months; put pigs that died from ASF in a bag which must be buried immediately by officials; and refrain from selling/consuming pigs/carcasses affected by ASF.

MoA concluded that the main strategic steps to prevent ASF from occurring are through the application of biosecurity and good management of pig farms, as well as strict and intensive monitoring of high-risk areas. It advised provinces with high pig populations, e.g., Nusa Tenggara Timur, North Sulawesi, West Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, Bali, Central Java, Central Sulawesi, Riau Islands, and Papua, to be alert to the possibility of ASF disease. MoA suggested enhancing awareness raising with farmers and advocacy to local leaders regarding the ASF threat [reference 1]. The Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health Services (DG PKH) has formed 102 Emergency Posts with Rapid Response Teams at all levels, in response to the Minister of Agriculture Decree (No. 820/Kpts/PK.32/M/12/2019, 12 Dec 2019). ASF control in North Sumatra has been carried out in an integrated manner by a Joint Team involving regional agencies (the Rapid Response Team, the Medan Veterinary Service, the Provincial Food Safety and Livestock Service, the Office of Public Works, the Health Service and the Police).

[No new actions reported from the other ASF-infected Asian countries during the past week.]

3. FAO recommendations
----------------------
ASF virus can be transmitted through pork and pork products (raw/frozen/dried/undercooked) in which the virus can survive for a long time. Intensive customs control of passengers' luggage is recommended during the high-risk period from the end of December 2019 to the beginning of February 2020, covering Christmas, New Year, and Lunar New Year holidays. Warning signs should be placed clearly at the border/customs entry, including airports and seaports, stating the consequences of bringing pork and pork products from ASF-infected countries/regions, and instructing passengers to discard pork products in designated disposal places or to hand over to the customs personnel.
