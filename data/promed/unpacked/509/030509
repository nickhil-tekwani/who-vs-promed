The veterinarians of the Udine section of the Venice-Region Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZSVe) described for the 1st time in Europe a case of leptospirosis in a wolf. The specimen, a male of about 7 months, had been hit in the province of Pordenone [Friuli-Venezia Giulia region] and subjected to health investigations according to the lesions found.

The 1st biomolecular diagnostic investigations highlighted the presence of a pathogenic _Leptospira_ in the kidney, while the serological examination for antibodies -- again against leptospira -- showed the presence of reactivity towards 3 serogroups: grippotyphosa, pomona, and icterohaemorrhagiae. Chronic interstitial nephritis emerged from the histopathological examination of the kidney.

Subsequently, the samples were sent to the National Reference Center for Leptospirosis of the IZS Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna for molecular typing, the phase in which the name and surname are assigned to the pathogen. The _Leptospira_ was identified as _L. kirschneri_, serogroup pomona, serovar mozdok (ST117).

It is a strain whose circulation in Italy is already known in pigs and dogs while in wild boar (_Sus scrofa_) the serogroup Pomona, serovar Pomona, has so far been detected. It is likely that the Mozdok serovar can also circulate in wild boar, given the homology of the species with respect to the domestic pig and that the wild boar can represent an infection reservoir for the wolf; from an epidemiological point of view, the prey-predator relationship between wild boar and wolf is compatible with the direct or indirect transmission of the infection.

The wolf in this case would represent more an accidental host than a reservoir, therefore an interesting epiphenomenon and sentinel of the diffusion of leptospira serogroups in the territory. The detection was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (IJERPH) [see citation below].

Leptospirosis is an endemic disease in Friuli-Venezia Giulia that causes clinical cases and deaths in dogs, despite the widespread use of vaccination, and also represents an important zoonosis. The disease is included among those listed as priorities in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia Wildlife Surveillance Plan.

The bacterium _Leptospira interrogans_ is known to cause infection in wild canids. The impact of leptospirosis in them is largely unknown. A serological survey conducted in wild canids from Norway found that 8.4% of the wolves sampled had antibodies against _L. interrogans_ serovar icterohaemorrhagiae (J Wildl Dis. 2010; 46(2): 474-480; https://doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-46.2.474). - Mod.PMB
