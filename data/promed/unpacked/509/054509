A cattle herd near the capital city Dakar has succumbed to Rift Valley fever [RVF], the Ministry of Livestock has announced. A total of 7 cases in a 190-cow herd at Rufisque [Dakar region] were notified by the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] on Friday [14 Mar 2014]. No animal deaths have been caused by the event to date.

Epidemiologists are unsure of the [source of infection], although are blaming the wet season on 'unknown or inconclusive vectors.'

Dr Mbargou Lo, Director of Veterinary Services, confirmed measures are in place to control the spread of the condition previously reported in Senegal last year [2013], killing 8 goats.

The 1st outbreak, in the northern extremities of the Saint-Louis district, was reported close to the border with Mauritania, among several goat herding operations. In all, 37 goats caught Rift Valley fever.

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a zoonotic, arthropod-borne viral disease important in domesticated ruminants. It is characterized by high mortality rates in young animals and abortions in pregnant ruminants. RVF is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Epidemics occur in this region when heavy rainfalls cause infected mosquito eggs to hatch, and large numbers of susceptible animals are present.

RVF epizootics are often accompanied by human disease. Many human cases are caused by occupational exposure to blood and tissues from infected animals, but mosquito-borne transmission can cause epidemics. The most common form of the disease is a self-limiting, flu-like illness; however, ocular disease and rare cases of fatal hemorrhagic fever also occur.

The media report above is based upon Senegal's follow-up report no. 2 addressing this epizootic, dated 14 Mar 2014, available, with an interactive map, at http://tinyurl.com/oqcf5uc. According to this OIE report, the outbreak in cattle had started 10 Oct 2013; thus, this is a belated reporting of an event which had taken place about 5 months ago. It involved 7 cases of RVF recorded within a herd of 190 susceptible cattle; no deaths reported. For the diagnosis, reportedly performed on 10 Oct 2013 by Senegal's National Livestock and Veterinary Research Laboratory, real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) was applied. The report included the following epidemiological comment: "The rainy winter season is the period at risk favourable to the proliferation of vectors transmitting Rift Valley fever."

The same epizootic included 3 earlier RVF outbreaks, as follows:

1. The 1st outbreak, which started 10 Sep 2013, involved Dorcas gazelles (_Gazella dorcas_) in north-west Senegal. The immediate notification, with a map, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14138. It included the following epidemiological comment: "Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne disease. The winter season, rainy, hot and humid is the period at risk, favourable to the proliferation of vectors. The date of last detection of the disease in wild species was 2004" (see 20130924.1964250).

2. Outbreaks no. 2 and 3, involving 2 goat flocks in north Senegal on the border with Mauritania, reported on 10 Oct 2013 in follow-up report no. 1, available with map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=14211. The outbreaks had started on 16 and 19 Sep 2013 respectively, affecting a total of 37 cases out of 208 susceptible goats, of which 8 died.

It will be of interest to note if human RVF cases have been recorded in Senegal during the (now, apparently terminated) disease season.
