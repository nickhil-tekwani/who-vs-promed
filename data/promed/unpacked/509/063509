Chilean Agricultural & Livestock Farming Service steps up
surveillance because of an equine flu outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
Cases have been confirmed in 8 equine facilities in Valparaiso,
Maule, Araucania, and Metropolitan regions, and no lethal cases have
been recorded in horses. The responsible strain is endemic for Chile.
Chilean Agricultural & Livestock Farming Service (SAG, according to
its Spanish initials) recommended updating vaccination programs in
horses and reporting any occurrence of signs suggesting equine flu,
and it also stated that this disease does not affect humans or other
domestic animal species.
Mr. Francisco Bahamonde-Medina, National Head of SAG, reported that
the equine flu virus was detected in a facility located in Quillota
Province, Valparaiso region. Laboratory tests indicated that the
strain is endemic for Chile, and it also does not affect other
domestic animals or humans, he emphasized.
Mr. Bahamonde commented that according to follow-up activities
performed, the horses may have become infected during their
participation in 2 competitions in Valparaiso and El Maule regions,
where there were also animals from other regions of the country.
Cases of 8 equine facilities from Valparaiso, Maule, Araucania, and
Metropilitan regions have been confirmed, and no lethal cases nor new
cases have been reported.
Equine influenza is a highly contagious viral animal disease, and it
is characterized by the presence of dry cough, nasal discharge, and
fever. The virus is rapidly spread in any non-immunized population.
In partially immunized animals, the aforementioned signs may not
always be present, and clinical manifestations of the disease may not
be readily evident, so an accurate diagnosis is indispensable in
order to differentiate this condition from a mild respiratory disease.
Three vaccines against equine flue are registered and authorized for
use, and SAG recommended performing or updating regular vaccination
programs in order to achieve high immunity levels necessary for
preventing this viral infection and to report horses with cough,
fever and nasal discharge so that epidemiological investigation is performed.

[Equine influenza is a viral disease caused by viruses closely
related to those that cause flu in people. Two subtypes of influenza
A virus are known to cause influenza in horses; these are the
subtypes: H7N7 (formerly known as A/equine 1) and H3N8 (formerly
known as A/equine 2). [Partially extracted from:
<http://195.224.162.216/equiflunet/equiflunet_faq.html>].
Although the virus designations are similar subtypes, this particular
virus does not affect humans. However, there is recent research that
it may be related to a strain of influenza found in canines.
The disease can spread rapidly through a herd or grouping of horses.
The primary signs are those of a cold, with coughing, hacking and a
mild nasal discharge. This easily aerosolizes the virus, potentially
infecting other animals.
Antibiotics may be used, but are only there to combat any
opportunistic bacteria that are secondary invaders, as antibiotics do
not have an effect on viruses. Sick horses may recover with adequate
nursing care and plenty of rest.
There are vaccines to prevent this disease. - Mod.TG]
