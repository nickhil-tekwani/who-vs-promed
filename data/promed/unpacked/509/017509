[1] CDC Report

The CDC, in collaboration with state departments of health and the
FDA, is investigating an outbreak of infections caused by a type of
salmonella called _Salmonella_ [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium. This
infection has no relationship to typhoid fever, which is caused by
another organism.
Serotype Typhimurium typically causes an illness with fever and
non-bloody diarrhea, which commonly resolves after about one week.
This illness is different from that caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7,
which produces bloody diarrhea, severe cramps, and in some persons,
severe kidney disease.
PulseNet, the network of public health laboratories that performs
molecular subtyping [DNA fingerprinting?] on bacteria that cause
foodborne illnesses, has identified a specific strain of _S._
Typhimurium that has caused this outbreak. Cases caused by the
specific strain have been detected regularly at low frequency
(average, 86 cases per year) for the past 5 years, indicating the
presence of this strain at low levels in the environment and the food chain.
The outbreak has involved 171 cases of infection by this strain in 19
states reported since 1 Sep 2006. The median age of patients is 36
years, and 59 percent are female. As with most infections by
salmonella, most patients had a febrile diarrheal illness. Of 73
patients for whom clinical data has been reported, 14 (19 percent)
were hospitalized; there have been no deaths reported. At this time,
few new cases are being detected, and there is little evidence of
continuing risk to the public.
CDC and its public health partners are vigorously working to identify
the specific contaminated food or foods that caused this outbreak.
Outbreaks from a widely distributed contaminated food cause cases to
be scattered across the country, and the identity of the contaminated
food is often not readily apparent. In outbreaks like this one,
identification of the contaminated food requires conducting detailed
standardized interviews with recovering case-patients and with
non-ill members of the public [controls?] to compare the foods they
had eaten. Using statistical methods, the contaminated food is
identified as one eaten more commonly by case-patients than the
controls. This statistically-based method of identifying contaminated
foods is routinely supplemented and confirmed by laboratory testing
of foods. The process is labor intensive and may require days to
weeks. As soon as the contaminated food is identified, if there is
evidence of ongoing risk, public health officials can advise the
public to avoid it and remove the food from the marketplace.
Precise information on avoiding infection with the outbreak strain of
salmonella will be provided by CDC as soon as the contaminated
food(s) is identified.

Connecticut health officials have identified 6 people who were
sickened by the same strain of salmonella that led to the temporary
closing of a popular Canton eatery early in October 2006, but who had
not eaten at the restaurant.
The cases are another piece of the puzzle in the outbreak, which
eventually sickened at least 172 people in 18 states, according to
CDC. Dr. Matthew Cartter, the state deputy epidemiologist, said 23
cases were traced to Margaritas restaurant.
11 people have been hospitalized in the outbreak, including 4 in
Connecticut. No deaths have been reported. State health officials are
working with the CDC to try to determine the source of the outbreak.
They believe the bacteria spread through produce, such as lettuce or tomatoes.
Health officials ordered Margaritas closed on 13 Oct 2006, and the
restaurant was thoroughly cleaned. Cartter said the 1st conference
call with other states and the CDC occurred on 19 Oct 2006, the day
Margaritas was cleared to reopen.
The 6 cases not associated with the restaurant are still being investigated.
Even though the cause has not been determined, Cartter said it
appears there is no current threat in the food distribution system
because the last case has been traced to food consumed on 6 Oct 2006.
"Whatever the source of the contamination was, it appears to be
something that happened and is over," he said.

A salmonella outbreak possibly linked to produce has sickened 15
Kentuckians, one person in Indiana and at least 155 people in 17
other states in recent weeks.
In Kentucky, the outbreak began in Laurel and Whitley counties in
southeastern Kentucky, followed by cases in the Lexington-area
counties of Fayette and Scott, said Dr. Robert Brawley, chief of the
Communicable Disease Branch of the Kentucky Department of Public Health.
The Kentucky cases occurred in September 2006, Brawley said. Four
people were hospitalized, all from Laurel County, he said.
Kentucky epidemiologists have not identified a common source of the
state's cases, Brawley said.
Health officials estimate that more than 1.4 million cases of
salmonella infection occur in the United States each year, about 1.3
million of them from food.
