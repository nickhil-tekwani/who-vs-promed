Epidemiological Alert, Zika virus infection
--------------------------

Caribbean epidemiologic alert following reports of Zika virus in Brazil
---------------------
Following reports of suspected Zika virus in Brazil, the health ministries of several Caribbean countries have issued advisories for the mosquito-borne viral disease. On Thu [21 May 2015] the Jamaica Health Ministry issued an epidemiological alert after the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) noted the potential spread of this arbovirus across territories where the vectors (Aedes) are present.

In addition, Trinidad and Tobago health officials also issued an advisory, asking that citizens prepare for the mosquito-borne diseases that come with the approaching rainy season, including the Zika virus. In early 2014, the 1st locally acquired transmission of Zika virus in the Americas was reported on Easter Island, according to the Chilean Ministry of Health.
