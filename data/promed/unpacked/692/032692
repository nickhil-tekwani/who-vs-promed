[Please note that much of the testing was done last spring [2009] and
it appears as if this infection was picked up by enhanced
surveillance in pigs. It would be very useful to know what exactly
the enhanced surveillance strategy consists of. Another point of note
is this report contains no indication of sick farm workers as many of
the other recent reports do. - Mod.PC]
