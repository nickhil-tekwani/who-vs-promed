Further to a request by the OIE Animal Health Information Department
for information that has been circulating on the occurrence of highly
pathogenic avian influenza in Bangladesh, on 31 Jan 2004 the Delegate
of Bangladesh to the OIE sent the following response:
I have received your letter inquiring about the possible presence of
highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in Bangladesh, along with a
copy of a report extracted on-line.
The incident that generated speculation that chicken deaths were
linked to avian influenza was responded to immediately, and the
affected poultry farms were promptly inspected by qualified and
experienced veterinarians. In accordance with the typical approach to
surveillance inspection of birds, follow-up on reports of sick birds,
examination of flock records, and postmortem examination of dead
birds were carried out, and experts were fully satisfied that deaths
were in no way linked to avian influenza virus.
In the wake of the bird flu outbreak in some Asian countries, the
Bangladesh Government has taken some steps to strengthen surveillance
at the field level, including sero-monitoring and measures to
restrict illegal entry of birds. Surveillance teams headed by
veterinarians are formed at the district and sub-district level. They
are advised to follow the standard surveillance method and are asked
to communicate immediately if they suspect any case. To date, there
is no evidence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in
Bangladesh.
We are keeping a vigilant eye on the industry, and the industry is
fully co-operating with us.
Bangladesh has been regularly providing the OIE with disease reports
and is pledged to notify the OIE about all the significant diseases.
Bangladesh is fully aware of its commitment and knows the
consequences of suppression of facts and would not hesitate to
provide you with any relevant information.
