A 2nd case of St Louis encephalitis has been confirmed in Clark County [Nevada], a week after it recorded its 1st case of the mosquitoborne disease in nearly a decade, according to health officials. The cases are the only 2 confirmed in the US by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this year [2016], a CDC spokesman said.

The Southern Nevada Health District reported Friday [2 Sep 2016] that a man 50 or older contracted the disease but did not suffer from the more serious neuroinvasive form of the illness. The Clark County resident's identity and details of how he contracted the illness will not be released. "This confirmed case is a reminder to southern Nevadans that mosquito season is not over and it is important to continue to protect themselves from mosquito bites and eliminate breeding sources around their homes," the district said in the release.

Another man in the same age range was briefly hospitalized last month after developing the more serious form of the illness, becoming the 1st person with a confirmed case of St Louis encephalitis in Nevada since 2007.

St. Louis encephalitis often causes no symptoms or mild health issues including fever and headache, but serious cases can result in paralysis, coma and death.

Areas of southern California, south western Arizona and Nevada have reported St Louis encephalitis-positive mosquitoes this year [2016].

[Although the above individual did not have the more serious neuroinvasive form of St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus infection, his infection must have been serious enough to seek medical attention and have blood samples taken for diagnosis. Most SLE virus infections are not neuroinvasive. As noted in the previous post reporting the 1st Nevada case (ProMED-mail archive no. 20160828.4446524), SLE virus is endemic in the south western USA and sporadic cases in humans occur there infrequently. Last year (2015), human cases occurred in the adjoining state of Arizona and positive mosquitoes were found in California. SLE virus was found in mosquitoes in Nevada in 2005. According to CDC, only 3 human cases of SLE have been reported in Nevada since 1964. Wild birds are the reservoir host and mosquitoes in the genus _Culex_ are vectors that transmit SLE virus. Avoidance of mosquito bites and elimination of mosquito breeding sites in this area is good advice that should be heeded by the local residents. - Mod.TY
