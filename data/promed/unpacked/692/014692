[With this new case, Laos now has 2 areas affected with ASF, Salavane province and Vientiane capital.

"The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry confirmed the occurrence of the first ASF outbreak in Toumlan district, Salavane province on 20 Jun 2019. ASF is still spreading in the area, with number reported reaching 2616." http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/ASF/situation_update.html

Vientiane is on a bend of the Mekong River, at which point it forms the border with Thailand (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vientiane).

You can zoom in to examine an area of outbreak in more detail. You can also see all available details about a given outbreak by clicking on the map).

"On [9 Apr 2019], the Thai Cabinet agreed to fund and implement a plan to prepare Thailand for a potential African swine fever (ASF) outbreak. To enact this plan, the Cabinet approved a total budget of 148.5 million baht (USD 4.7 million) for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021. While there has not yet been any identified cases of ASF in Thailand, the disease has been spreading rapidly in nearby Southeast Asian countries."

"The ASF preparedness plan establishes a National Committee on African Swine Fever Prevention, Control, and Eradication. This committee will be chaired by one of the Deputy Prime Ministers and will include representatives from relevant government agencies, swine farmers, and the private sector. The plan authorizes spending for ASF prevention, surveillance, damage mitigation, disease control, and swine recovery.

"The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives (MOAC) recently published research showing the economic damage that would accrue if an ASF outbreak occurs in Thailand. MOAC estimates that if the disease infects 30 percent of swine population, economic damage will total 21.17 billion baht (USD 672 million). In the scenario of a 50 percent swine infection rate, the economic damage climbs to 35.28 billion baht (USD 1.1 billion) while in the 80 percent infection rate scenario the economic damage reaches 56.45 billion baht (USD 1.8 billion)."
