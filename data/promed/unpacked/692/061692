_Plasmodium knowlesi_ infection in a Japanese returning from Malaysia
---------------------------------------------------------------------
We have recently confirmed _Plasmodium knowlesi_ infection in a traveler returning from Malaysia to Japan.

In September 2012, a previously healthy Japanese man in his 30's presented to the travel clinic of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) hospital in Tokyo with a 2-day history of fever, headache, and arthralgia.

He had visited Temenggor, Johor, and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia during 2 months for field investigations of entomology and zoology, without malaria chemoprophylaxis.

His symptoms started 10 days after returning from Malaysia to Japan. On admission, his body temperature was 37.0 deg C [98.6 deg F], other vital signs were normal. Physical examination showed left upper abdominal pain and mild splenomegaly.

Laboratory investigations showed thrombocytopenia and slightly elevated liver enzymes. The thin blood smear with Giemsa stein showed malaria parasites including band forms similar to _P. malariae_, and heavily pigmented schizonts inside non-enlarged erythrocytes.

He was diagnosed with non-falciparum malaria and was treated with mefloquine (1500 mg base). He recovered in 3 days after treatments. He was discharged from our hospital on the 7th day of admission without any complications. We finally diagnosed human _P. knowlesi_ infection based on nested multiplex PCR analysis.

This is the 1st reported case of imported human _P. knowlesi_ infection in Japan. _P. knowlesi_ infection might be more popular among travelers returning from Southeast Asia than previously thought.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr Ryutaro Tanizaki for submitting this 1st hand case report and raising the awareness of our subscribers to the emerging importance of _P. knowlesi_ in human disease.

_Plasmodium knowlesi_ is widespread in Southeast Asia and the distribution follows the distribution of the macaque monkey, its primary host (for pictures of macaque monkeys and their distributions, see http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwvir/VirusInfo/macaque.html). A recent review is by Cox-Singh (Zoonotic malaria: _Plasmodium knowlesi_, an emerging pathogen. Curr Opin Infect Dis. 2012 Oct; 25(5): 530-6; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22710318). Humans visiting the biotope of the macaques are at risk, and the patient reported here had spent 2 months doing field work in areas where macaques are also found.

The vectors are _Anopheles latens_ and _Anopheles cracens_ (Vythilingam I: _Plasmodium knowlesi_ in humans: a review on the role of its vectors in Malaysia. Trop Biomed. 2010; 27: 1-12; full text of article available at http://www.msptm.org/files/01_-_12_Indra_Vythilingam.pdf).

Temenggor and Johor are located on peninsular Malaysia. Temenggor lake is located in the northeast of Perak, whereas Johor is located in the south of the peninsula.
