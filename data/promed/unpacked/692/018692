PESTE DES PETITS RUMINANTS - IRAQ (NINEVAH, DOHUK)
******************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

The Iraq Ministry of Agriculture has requested FAO assistance for
control of
outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) in northern Iraq. The
outbreaks were reported to have started in July 1998 and to affect the
two
neighbouring Governorates of Ninevah and Dohuk.
PPR is a most serious emerging disease of sheep and goats which has
caused
heavy losses to small ruminant production in the Middle East in recent
years, as well as in sub-Saharan Africa and eastwards into South Asia as
far
as Bangladesh. This is the first record of its presence in Iraq although
it
has been realised for several years that the country was at risk of
introduction. There is a high risk of spread to other Governorates if
the
disease is not contained. This presents a serious threat to food
security in
Iraq especially as the importance of small ruminant production has
increased
significantly with increased availability of grains in the north.
PPR is difficult to recognise, especially on first introduction, because
it
is easily confused with other diseases which present with pneumonia such
as
pneumonic pasteurellosis and contagious caprine pleuropneumonia. Control
of
outbreaks is facilitated by the use of a newly-available homologous
vaccine.
