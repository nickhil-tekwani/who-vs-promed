EU lifts restrictions on exports of bovine meat from Cyprus
-----------------------------------------------------------
The European Union Standing Veterinary Committee decided to lift the
restriction measures on exports of bovine meat from Cyprus. The
restrictions were imposed after foot and mouth disease [FMD] was detected
in Cyprus. The Cyprus government had asked that exports of bovine meat
resume. The meat exported will come from areas outside the 10 km [6.2 mile]
surveillance zone and under strict sanitary conditions.
The same committee had lifted on 3 Dec 2007 the prohibition of dispatching
pig-meat from Cyprus from the zones beyond the 10 km zone, around the
infected holding where FMD was detected.
Cyprus Veterinary Services culled recently thousands of animals, which
tested positive for FMD, as part of efforts to eliminate the virus and its
destructive consequences for the island's farming sector and the economy.

[The above decision was taken during the meeting on 19 Dec 2007 of EC
Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) Section:
animal health & animal welfare. It is in line with the working document
SANCO/10585/2007 "Foot and mouth disease in Cyprus" (3 attachments),
available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/fmd_19122007_cy.pdf>.

Cyprus presented during the meeting a report on its current situation,
which is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/fmd_19122007-1_cy.pdf>.
Among others, the report includes the detailed table "data on samples
examined (by 17 Dec 2007)" on all sheep, goat, bovine and pig farms tested
within the 3 km [1.86 mile] protection zone, 10 km surveillance zone and
outside the said zones. A total of 569 farms were surveyed (996 samplings),
in which 30 129 samples collected and tested (see slide 4). The report
concludes:
1. Definitely NO virus circulation demonstrated.
2. Only seropositive sheep and goats have been detected.
3. Selective culling of all seropositive sheep and goats.
4. Samplings and examinations proceeded as programmed with negative results.
5. The 3 km Zone was lifted.
6. Lifting of the 10 km Zone (by the end of this week).
The European Commission decided to apply stepwise rather than immediate and
total alleviation of (all species) animal movement restrictions and export
bans, in spite of the accumulated and convincing evidence, based upon
wide-scale surveillance activities, that no virus circulation (thus no
"outbreak" _in sensu stricto_) was involved. The reason for the formal
decision to continue restrictions seems to be mainly related to Cyprus
declaration of 5 Nov 2007 (on 2 FMD outbreaks, based on serological and
debatable clinical findings), followed, on 6 Nov 2007, by a declaration of
other 2 outbreaks (based on serological findings). - Mod.AS]
