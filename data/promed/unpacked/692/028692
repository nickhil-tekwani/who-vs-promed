For the 44th Epidemiological Week, no yellow fever cases have been
notified. Epidemiological surveillance in high-risk States still
continues. Coverage monitoring in high- and medium- risk areas is
maintained to detect susceptible individuals.
Guarico State reports 2 epizootics; one (1) in Guayabal town and one
(1) in Camaguan town, this State has 107.67 percent [see comment
below] accumulated vaccination coverage, febrile case surveillance
curves are maintained within safety limits, and no fever and jaundice
cases have been reported.
As of the 44th epidemiological week, 10 yellow fever cases have been
reported, 576 individuals have been investigated, corresponding to
weeks 17 (1) and 20 (2) in Merida State; in week 35 one (1) case in
Apure State, in week 36, one (1) case in Bolivar State; and in weeks
34, 36, 37, 38, and 40 (total, 5 cases, one for each week) in
Portuguesa State.
In the registry for 2005, as of the 44th Epidemiological Week, 576
cases with fever and jaundice have been studied; there are 10 cases
of yellow fever, and in 484 of the assessed cases yellow fever was
ruled out. Amongst them, 305 still do not have a definite diagnosis,
34 were diagnosed with dengue fever; 99, hepatitis A; 08, hepatitis
B; 38, leptospirosis; and there are 82 pending results.

[Concerning 107.67 percent accumulated vaccination coverage as
mentioned in the 2nd paragraph, it is not uncommon to find
vaccination coverages reported as greater than 100 percent. That
occurs when the estimates for the denominator are off (they use
population estimates that are lower than actual) or when the
numerator includes more than planned for (for example, if they are
doing coverages of the 0-5 year-old age group and 5-10 year-olds are
vaccinated and counted in the vaccinations given numerator... or when
they plan to vaccinate a town, and there are people who live in
another town and come to this town for vaccinations). - Mod.MPP]
