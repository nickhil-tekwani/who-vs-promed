Suspected poisoning due to gastrointestinal infections
---------------------------------------------------------
50 cases of gastrointestinal illness (rather than 300-400 cases as
mentioned in the media) have been reported in Dohuk in northern Iraq.
27 percent of cases were reported from a housing complex in Khanak
inhabited by a religious sect, the Yazedia.
The clinical features shown were abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea,
vomiting, fever (especially in children), dehydration, headache, and
prostration. There has been one death from a heart attack in a doctor
recovering from diarrhoea.
Stool sampling has been carried out and has shown a high incidence of
_Entamoeba histolytica_, moreover water samples taken from housing
supplies in Khanak have shown the presence of _E. coli_ [_Escherichia
coli_ we presume]. The water supply network is in poor condition, and
there is contamination with sewage. Measures have been taken to
improve food hygiene and to treat domestic water supplies, and the
frequency of cases is now declining.

cause turned out to be a leaking sewage pipe. - Mod.EP]

The Yazidi are not Muslim. They are descended from Zoroastrianism,
the ancient traditional religion of Persians (Iranians) and Kurds. A
few hold-outs live by appearing to blend in with the majority Sunni
culture.
That was my info when in Iraq.
