With the recent outbreaks of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) respiratory infections and mysterious polio-like illnesses in US children fading, it seems increasingly likely that the 2 are related, says an expert with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC has reported 1121 EV-D68 cases in 47 states since August 2014, a number that has not increased since 20 Nov 2014, with nearly all cases in children. Meanwhile, the total for the unexplained polio-like cases, involving sudden onset of weakness in one or more limbs, reached 90 on 28 Nov 2014, which was 2 more than a week earlier. Two reported cases were still being verified. James J. Sejvar, MD, a neuroepidemiologist with the CDC, said the latest known onset of a case of the polio-like illness occurred about 3 weeks ago. "We're continuing our surveillance and trying to identify new cases, but the good news is that it does appear that new cases have kind of ceased at this point," he told CIDRAP News.

The CDC now refers to the condition as acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) in children. Earlier, the agency generally referred to it as unexplained neurologic illness with limb weakness in children. "It's an illness with acute onset that basically results in flaccid weakness of the limbs, sometimes with cranial nerve involvement, and it is a myelitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord," Sejvar explained. He said some earlier CDC statements referred to the condition as "anterior myelitis," which is often used to describe polio. "But in many of the cases we've seen, the inflammation or infection is not limited to the anterior portion of the spinal cord; it's in fact the whole central portion of the spinal cord, so we dropped the 'anterior' part."

However, a little less than half of the 90 children who met the AFM case definition had evidence of EV-D68 infection at nonsterile sites, such as in nasal or stool samples, he said. "There are reasons that a child may actually have been infected with EV-68 but not tested positive," he added. "That has to do with the timing of the collection of the specimen in relation to onset of illness and the way the specimen is handled. It's entirely possible that even more children with this illness have had EV-68 infection than we're currently ascertaining." Sejvar noted that the 1st cluster of AFM cases was seen in Colorado in August and September 2014 (officials said 4 of 10 case-patients there tested positive for EV-D68), and more cases were later found in other states. "It's notable that this clustering or outbreak of acute flaccid myelitis occurred against the backdrop of this large national outbreak of EV-68 respiratory infection among children," he said. In addition, the number of new EV-D68 cases started dropping sharply in early October 2014, and the incidence of new AFM cases started declining about the same time, Sejvar observed.

But experts aren't ready to declare that the AFM cases were caused by EV-D68, because the link is mainly a temporal association at this point, Sejvar added. "We haven't isolated the virus from the nervous system of these children that are suffering from acute flaccid myelitis, which would be far more convincing biologically that the virus is getting into the nervous system and causing this neurologic damage."

Sejvar also said he and his colleagues will be assessing how the patients fare over the long haul. He said the children in Colorado have been followed most closely, and some have had varying degrees of improvement in limb strength, but in most of them, the weakness has persisted.

The patients will be followed for 1 or 2 years, he said, adding, "If this behaves like other illnesses of this type, unfortunately the likelihood is that most of these children are going to be left with permanent neurologic and functional disability."

The CDC has said that EV-D68 infection was found in 12 patients who died, but it has not commented on the virus's role in the deaths, saying that determination is made by state and local officials. In October 2014, New Jersey officials said EV-D68 contributed to the death of a 4-year-old boy who died in his sleep.

[More detailed information can be accessed at the CDC website: Summary of Findings: Investigation of Acute Flaccid Myelitis in U.S. Children: 2014 http://www.cdc.gov/ncird/investigation/viral/sep2014/investigation.html.

Since September 2014, CDC and partners have been investigating reports of children across the United States who developed a sudden onset of weakness in one or more arms or legs with MRI scans that showed inflammation of the gray matter -- nerve cells -- in the spinal cord. This illness is now being referred to as acute flaccid myelitis. From 2 Aug to 26 Nov 2014, CDC has verified reports of 90 children in 32 states who developed acute flaccid myelitis that meets CDC's case definition. CDC is working with healthcare professionals and state and local health departments to investigate all the cases reported since August 2014. CDC is also in the process of verifying 2 additional reports. - Mod.CP]
