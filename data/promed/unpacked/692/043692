Monkeypox changes its pattern of human infection:
Following reports of ongoing cases of human monkeypox in Zaire representing
a new pattern of the disease, the Ministry of Health in Zaire and the World
Health Organization (WHO) organized an investigation in February 1997.
Monkeypox, a disease which closely resembles smallpox, is preventable by the
vaccination against smallpox. WHO is concerned that the ending of
vaccination programs for smallpox may have led to the seriousness of the
latest outbreak.
The study revealed that this outbreak represents the largest cluster of
monkeypox cases ever reported, and the proportion of patients that were 15
years of age or older (27%) was higher than previously reported (8%). Young
children have been most affected in previous outbreaks. These findings
contradict previously accepted findings on the nature of the disease.
The investigation Studies over a twenty year period have shown that the rate
of transmission of monkeypox within households was low, suggesting that the
disease had a low potential for transmission from person-to-person and that
an outbreak could not last long after the first patients recovered. However,
the recent study has shown that active cases in February 1997 were linked to
cases that occurred during the preceding 12 month period. The study also
revealed the following:
The rate of transmission from person-to-person (73%) was higher than
previously reported (30%). This was associated with the clustering of cases
in household compounds and prolonged chains of transmission from
person-to-person.
The proportion of deaths (3%) was lower than previously reported (10%).
The disease Monkeypox disease closely resembles ordinary forms of smallpox.
The viruses causing the two diseases are related and vaccination against
smallpox also protects against monkeypox. The emergence of monkeypox does
not mean that smallpox, which has been eradicated, is re-emerging.
All age groups are affected, but children who have not been vaccinated are
at the highest risk of death, about a 10% case fatality rate. Most cases
occur in remote villages of Central and West Africa close to tropical
rainforests where there is frequent contact with infected animals. Monkeypox
is usually transmitted to humans from squirrels and primates.
In the past, an outbreak of monkeypox would not go very far in the village
or last long because it did not spread extensively after the first patients
recovered. However, what concerns WHO is that the present study indicates
that monkeypox disease is changing its pattern of infection in humans. This
outbreak has a much higher rate of person-to-person transmission than seen
before, and spread through many generations of transmission, thus
maintaining the outbreak for more than a year.
Concern for WHO The ending of vaccination programmes against smallpox in the
late 1970's has probably led to an increase in susceptibility to monkeypox
and could explain the larger size of the outbreak, the higher proportion of
patients aged 15 and over, and the spread through many generations of
transmission. The changing nature of monkeypox disease is of concern to WHO.
In the past, before the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox
vaccination was widespread and protected against both smallpox and
monkeypox. Since the eradication of smallpox, vaccination programmes have
been discontinued as recommended by WHO. Though monekypox has been shown to
not be a threat to smallpox eradication by studies done throughout the
1980s, WHO is concerned that monkeypox could pose a localized public health
problem. WHO will therefore continue to maintain vigilance by strengthening
detection systems for monkeypox and completely investigating future
outbreaks so that the best strategy for prevention and control may be
developed.

NOTES CONCERNING THIS SERVICE:
The Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER) serves as an essential
instrument for the rapid and accurate dissemination of
epidemiological information on cases and outbreaks of diseases
under the International Health Regulations, other communicable
diseases of public health importance, including the newly
emerging or re-emerging infections, non-communicable diseases
and other health problems. The WER is distributed every Friday
in a bilingual English/French edition. The electronic edition
is free of charge and can be obtained through FTP: ftp.who.ch,
user name should be "anonymous", password should be your e.mail
address. The WER issues are in the subdirectory /pub/wer, or
WWW: http://www.who.ch/wer/wer_home.htm
Any queries on subscription to the printed edition should be
addressed to: World Health Organization, Distribution and
Sales, 20 Avenue Appia, CH-1211 Geneva 27, Fax: (+4122) 791 48
57
Issues of the WER are in AdobeTM AcrobatTM portable document
format (.pdf). To view the WER, the programme Acrobat Reader
is required
Separate .pdf files exist for each issue of the WER and are
named according to the volume and issue number, for example the
file wer7048 contains the WER volume 70, number 48.
Additionally, when disease news is published on the World Wide
Web, at http://www.who.ch/programmes/emc/news.htm, it is also
distributed to all subscribers to this majordomo group
To obtain help on using e.mail majordomo discussion group, send
a message to majordomo@who.ch with the word "help" as the body
of the message.
