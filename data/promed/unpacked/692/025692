Trade in Queensland citrus resumes
----------------------------------------
All Queensland citrus fruit should be back on the market this weekend after
officials today agreed to resume trade following the canker outbreak near
Emerald. Certified oranges, mandarins and other citrus grown outside the
infested property and Gayndah-Mundubbera region can be moved from midnight
tonight.
Primary Industries Minister Henry Palaszczuk said, "We're back in the game."
120 inspectors have been trained and should be online to certify produce
from late this afternoon. The crisis will cost the Government close to $10
million [USD 7.1 million].
The Department of Primary Industries Chris Adriaanson had good news for
nurseries, announcing that he had secured the commitment from other states
to accept Queensland nursery products again.
The Emerald property on which the disease was discovered is yet to respond
to another notice to destroy 30 000 lemon trees after the discovery of
further contamination late last week.
Meanwhile, more than 10 Queensland growers are investigating options for a
class action against the owners of the orchard where citrus canker was
found. They are yet to decide whether to sue for economic loss as a result
of interstate bans, applied when canker was found on Evergreen Farms owned
by Pacific Century Production.
In a similar case in South Australia, the High Court found that where a
producer had introduced a particular disease to the potato industry in
South Australia and the result for fellow producers in the surrounding
areas was that they could not sell into the interstate market the producer
was liable for those growers' losses.

[Citrus growers are relieved, to say the least, but the removal and burning
of infected trees is a massive undertaking. One wonders how long it will
take for Evergreen Farms, owned by Pacific Century Production, to resume
planting and production. - Mod.DH]
