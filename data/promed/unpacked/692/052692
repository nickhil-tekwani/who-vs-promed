When a shepherd tried to sell a sheep having anthrax symptoms at
Kothagudem [in the Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh] on Saturday [2
Feb 2008], local people prevented him and took it to the Animal
Husbandry Department.

Later, the officials confirmed that the animal developed symptoms of
anthrax. It was learnt that the shepherd, who left the scene
unnoticed, brought the sheep from Mahaboobnagar [Mahbubnagar
district, Andhra Pradesh.]

was in reality a lethal urinary infection; see ProMED-mail

Official sources said today [3 Feb 2008] 4 persons have died due to
suspected anthrax in Sunabeda and Semiliguda areas of the district
[Koraput, Orissa province] during the last 10 days.

While a resident of Pangifuda in Sunabbeda died after consuming
rotten meat, 3 others -- of Luhaba village -- in Semiliguda area lost
their lives after eating stale beef, chief district veterinary
officer S K Takri said. Stating that the deceased showed post-anthrax
complications, he said all the animals in and around these villages
were immunised as a precautionary measure.

The deceased and some others affected developed abnormal swellings
and boils all over their body, he said. Dr K H Reddy, in-charge of
Sunabeda primary health centre, said the situation was under control
with teams of doctors and health workers visiting affected areas with
medicines and vaccines for providing instant treatment to the
affected and the patients admitted in hospitals.

[Eating rotten meat is never to be advised but the response of the
public health and veterinary authorities would indicate that they
took the risk of this being anthrax very seriously.

Latterly we have had unconfirmed reports of anthrax in West Bengal:
- in Midnapore, west of Kolkata (Calcutta):
<http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Kolkata/17_cows_die_in_W_Midnapore/articleshow/2736260.cms>,
- and near Malda, northern West Bengal, on the Bangladeshi border:
<http://www.thestatesman.net/page.arcview.php?clid=10&id=214648&usrsess=1>

Traditionally, the eastern Indian states along the Bay of Bengal
coast have had the highest incidence of this disease in humans and
livestock. - Mod.MHJ
