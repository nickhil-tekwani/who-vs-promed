Here's the OIE report on F&M in Taiwan:
4 April 1997: Vol. 10 - No. 14
Contents: Foot and mouth disease in Taipei, China
See also: 28 March 1997, 21 March 1997
Follow-up report No. 2 Text of a fax received on 30 March 1997 from Dr Happy
K. Shieh, Director of the Animal Industry Department, Council of
Agriculture, Taipei:
End of previous report period: 21 March 1997 (see Disease Information, 10
[13], 55).
End of this report period: evening of 29 March 1997.

To date, no suspected cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been found
in species other than swine.
Total number of outbreaks identified since 1 January 1997: 1,106 pig farms.
Total number of animals in the affected farms:
species susceptible cases deaths destroyed slaughtered
swine 938,507 199,126 46,050 177,627 0
Diagnosis: most of the cases were tentatively diagnosed according to
clinical signs.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: still under investigation.
The first farm reported to be infected was run by the owner and his wife. No
animal had been introduced into the farm in the preceding month. No other
personnel entered the farrowing house during the week prior to the outbreak.
The farm is well managed. However, large flocks of sparrows fly in and out
freely.
A fishing harbour located 10 km west of the farm is notorious for its
smuggling activities. Animal products and the other agricultural products
are usually involved in these activities.
B. Other epidemiological details: due to the central mountain range running
lengthwise through main island, the disease has not spread to the eastern
part of Taiwan; neither have offshore islands been infected.
Control measures during reporting period:
- Stock vaccines, 40,000 doses (O1, A24, Asia 1), were released for
initialising nation-wide vaccination on 21 March 1997.
The first shipment of a bivalent (O1, Asia 1) FMD vaccine, comprising a
total of 526,000 doses, arrived on 26 and 27 March 1997 and was immediately
distributed throughout the island.
- Stamping-out policy is applied to infected farms.
[The bivalency was reported to Alex Donaldson when they at Pirbright
received samples for FMDV identification. Pirbright found only O1. The
continued absence of FMD in ruminants is puzzling. That the index farm had
no obvious sources of infection ("birds" are now disregarded as they are
known to not act as vectors.) is not surprising. Many years ago when I
worked with LP Smith on the aerobiology of this disease we found that in UK
outbreaks of FMD the index case/infected herd was usually the third to sixth
after the true primary case. MHJ]

Taiwanese admit wrong vaccine used to stem hog disease
A inappropriate vaccine has been used because inaccurate tests were used to
determine its effectiveness [?; there was no time for challenge tests;
probably a miswording for "virus misidentification". MHJ], admitted
embarrassed Taiwan officials.
The Taiwan Council of Agriculture said that three million tubes of vaccine,
a mixture of the 01 and Asia-1, were ordered. But it has since instructed
the supplier to change the remaining supply to the pure 01-type, according
to the Lianhe Zaobao newspaper.
The officials have also attempted to allay public fear by insisting that the
bivalent vaccine was just as effective in protecting healthy pigs from
foot-and-mouth disease. But these claims were repudiated immediately by the
head of the Veterinary Faculty of the National Taiwan University, who said
that it "might not be as effective". [Where are your friends when you need
them? MHJ]

Subject: Foot and mouth epidemic in Taiwan
The latest reports we [PDIC] have indicate that more than 1,000 pig farms
have been affected, involving about a million swine altogether. The number
of pigs clinically affected so far is over 200 thousand, of which 46,000
have died and over 170,000 have been destroyed.
So far no suspected cases of foot and mouth disease have been found in
species other than pigs. The central mountain range running lengthwise
through the main island seems to have blocked spread to the eastern part of
Taiwan. Offshore islands [have] not been infected either. The source of the
infection has not yet been conclusively ascertained. The first farm reported
infected was run by owner and wife and no animal had been introduced into
the farm in the preceding month. However, a fishing harbour located 10 km
west of the farm is notorious for smuggling activities, including animal
products!
The epidemic is being controlled by destruction of all susceptible animals
on affected farms and by a nationwide vaccination campaign. Further
information about the outbreak can be found on our website News page:
