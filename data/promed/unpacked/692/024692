Re: Suspected case of _T.evansi_ infection in human being in Sri Lanka, July
1999
Being advised of this case I contacted the epidemiology service
of that country, to which I posted relevant documentation. But since
October 1999, when I was advised that the patient had always
parasitemia with Trypanosoma-like organisms, I had no more information.
Did they succeed in identifying the strain, or any other hemoparasite?
