The incidence of enteric infections has increased in Murmansk. There
were 87 cases in January 2010 compared with 23 in December 2009. This
represents an increase of about 20-40 percent above the annual average
rate. This situation is a consequence of rotavirus infections.
Children are a risk group, and there have been 7 outbreaks in Murmansk
preschools. Disinfection measures in schools and kindergartens have
been intensified, and some simple infection control procedures have
been implemented, such as washing and peeling fruit, hand washing, and
avoidance of the use of tap water for drinking.

Five children from the same kindergarten were hospitalized in Ufa
[Bashkortostan Republic] last week because of rotavirus infection.
Food poisoning was suspected at first, however laboratory tests
confirmed rotavirus infection. Specialists from Rospotrebnadzor [The
Russian Human Welfare Protection Agency] are investigating this
outbreak. Probably, one of the children contracted infection outside
the kindergarten and infected the others.

[The incidence of rotavirus infection in Russia is on the increase.

There has been a trend of increasing rotavirus rates in children
during the last decade. Rotavirus constitutes a considerable portion
of acute enteric morbidity, especially in children under 3 years old,
who account for more than half of the cases. - Corr.BA]

[Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoeal disease in
infants and young children globally. Rotaviruses are estimated to be
responsible for approximately 527 000 deaths each year globally, with
more than 85 percent of these deaths occurring in low-income countries
in Africa and Asia. Over 2 million are hospitalized each year with
pronounced dehydration. Children under 5 years of age, especially
those between 6 months and 2 years, are most vulnerable to the
disease. Vaccines against rotavirus gastroenteritis are now available
and are the single prevention and control measure with the most
significant impact on reducing severe disease incidence.

Details of the rotavirus vaccines currently available are described on
the WHO website at:
<http://www.who.int/vaccine_research/diseases/diarrhoeal/en/index5.html>.
