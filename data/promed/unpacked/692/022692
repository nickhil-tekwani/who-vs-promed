Lessons for Africa and the world from Sierra Leone
-----------------------------------
Let me preface my comments by saying responding efficiently and effectively to an Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak would in all probability be a challenge for any country in the world. When the EVD outbreak occurred in Guinea, our neighboring country, early in 2014, we as a country seem to have missed the opportunity to ensure our preparedness should we have an outbreak in Sierra Leone.

When the outbreak did occur, we were not prepared for it; the necessary PPE (personal prevention equipment i.e. masks, goggles, gloves etc. were in short supply; testing centers and laboratories were not set up to handle testing for EVD).

Medical staff not trained at first
------------------------
Medical staff were not trained in proper use of the PPE; medical expertise with genuine knowledge and experience in dealing with EVD were in extremely short supply. Tracing units had to be organized and trained; burial teams had to be organized and trained. Ambulances had to be procured and or refitted to accommodate only EVD victims. The general population began to protest vigorously that regular patients and EVD patients had to go to the same facility for medical attention. This put the uninfected population at higher risk.

Only after the outbreak occurred was there mass training of medical staff in government and private hospitals, treatment centers and isolation units/wards established. The rural population in Kailahun District, the 1st "hot spot" had not been sensitized, and the government and other 1st responders did not take into account traditional customs and rites related to caring for the sick and burying the dead.

Little sensitivity in dealing with customs
--------------------------
Added to that was the fact that the behavior of the Ministry of Health, accompanied by military and police, showed little sensitivity in dealing with the population directly affected. Rumors were plentiful as to the cause and role of the government in addressing the issue. In some cases, the outbreak and response were attributed to political dynamics (the outbreak occurred in the opposition party's stronghold or heartland). There was a genuine lack of trust between those who desperately wanted to assist and those who desperately needed the assistance; this lack of trust developed into opposition and resistance dynamics that fed on and grew due to misinformation and rumors. All the above has led to this point; the ebolavirus and response has reached a crisis point.

Interfaith dialogue
----------------
Recently, we have invited other religious bodies (Catholic mission, Pentecostal fellowship and different Muslim bodies) to address the EVD crisis from a united perspective. This has now developed into the Religious Leaders Task Force on Ebola (RLTFE) which in turn has conducted more anti-EVD trainings in more communities; they have printed stickers for vehicles and T-shirts announcing that EVD can be prevented; heads of churches and mosques speak to their congregation not only from the pulpit but on radio and television. Buckets of chlorinated water are now found at the entrance of many churches and mosques.

One challenge is the weather. It is the rainy season now, and transport to rural communities is time consuming and hazardous due to the condition of the roads. Our vehicles (4 wheel drive and motorcycles) take a regular pounding. Other challenges are the expenses for accessing resources to cover more training and sensitization at the community level, training and sensitization of religious leaders, collaborating with Ministry or Health workers (assisting them with logistical issues).

Ebola affects everyday life in Sierra Leone: lack of income
---------------------------------
In those areas that are the epicenter, movement will now restricted; this will affect trade and livelihoods of the people; people live here on a day to day economy, that is they go to the market to sell and then get money to purchase what they need that day, or they go fishing, cut firewood or charcoal, sell and buy basic household necessities. When movement is restricted, incomes and livelihoods will be affected.

The wellbeing of persons and access to medical services and health are disrupted. The EVD unit is in the Government General Hospital in Kenema. I hear from staff that patients are apprehensive about going there for treatment when EVD patients are coming to the same facility when they are sick (vomiting and diarrhea).

Back to school in September?
------------------------
Currently, schools are on holiday, but there is fear that in September they will not be open. This will retard or set back the educational process for our children. The attendant danger of teenagers when they are left unsupervised with lots of time on their hands is the nightmare of mothers. Public exams have been postponed due to the EVD outbreak, and this will affect the performance of pupils taking the exams in as much as schools have been dismissed since mid-June [2014]. The percentage of those passing the exams will decrease, and this may affect students' opportunity for future education or employment. In all probability, gains made in decreasing the school "drop-out" rate among students, especially female students, may be lost, while teenage pregnancy may increase.

Grief for the children
-------------------
Personally, I am emotionally affected; though our war was considered the most brutal during its time, my fear now of the situation is worse than it was during the war, simply because you cannot see the enemy; you cannot adequately protect yourself from it; just a handshake from a friend or relative, and you may be contacting an infected person, and your likelihood of survival is quite low. Also as a mother, I think about the number of children who will have lost their parents and, because of that, possibly their link to a good education at home and at school.

It will take time to slow progression of disease
----------------------------
During the next couple of weeks, I expect a continued increase in the number of newly confirmed cases of EVD and an increase in the number of deaths. I do expect increased resources being applied to the crisis, but it will take time to slow the progression of the disease. As a nation, we need to increase the sensitization and awareness messages that result in empowering individuals and communities to rigorously implement the full range of EVD prevention strategies leading to a decrease in the number of newly infected persons. We need to rebuild the trust between the government medical professionals and staff and the populace in rural and urban communities. We also need to ensure that the quantity and quality of the PPE used by health professionals is readily available for those who need it.

God bless all of you, and thank you for your support. Continue to pray for the front line medical staff who are protecting us to the best of their ability and for all persons engaged in attempting to prevent the spread of this virus.

[The above is a warning accompanied by very practical advice from a country that is going through an EVD nightmare.

ALL COUNTRIES at risk of importing cases -- particularly neighboring African countries -- should take note and understand what can happen if they don't prepare in advance.
