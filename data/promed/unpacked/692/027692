A Chinese-made diet pill linked to a number of deaths in Asia may have
killed 2 more Japanese women, the authorities in Tokyo say.
The health ministry says 64 Japanese people (most of them women) have
suffered liver damage and other ailments believed to be caused by an
ingredient in the herbal slimming supplements. Of those, a total of 4 have
now died and 28 are in hospital.
Deaths linked to the diet pill have also been reported in Singapore and in
China itself, where the authorities outlawed the supplement last week.
The ban came after the pill, which sells in China under the name Yuzhitang,
was found to contain the banned appetite suppressant fenfluramine. Despite
the ban, bottles of Yuzhitang are reportedly still being sold in some
pharmacies and cosmetics shops. Fenfluramine has been linked in the US to
health problems affecting the heart, thyroid, and blood.
The pill has raised concerns throughout Asia. In Japan, a 60-year-old woman
died in a Tokyo hospital in May, a month after taking the supplements. On
Wednesday, officials said they had linked the death of a second Japanese
woman to the weight-loss medication. And on Friday, the Japanese health
authorities said the supplement may have been behind the deaths of a
36-year-old woman from hepatitis in November 2001 and a woman in her 60s in
February 2002.
The authorities in Singapore ordered the withdrawal of the pill when a
woman died and a number of others needed treatment for liver problems after
taking it. Japanese officials point to a lack of legislation covering
safety for products that claim to be nature-based.
"In Japan, if something is considered a 'health product' it doesn't need to
meet the same high standards that prescription drugs do and its claims
don't have to be proven," said Hiroyuki Tanaka of the Japanese Health Ministry.
In Singapore, a version of the pills sold under the name Slim 10 was banned
earlier this year after being found to contain fenfluramine. A Singaporean
woman who took Slim 10 died last month after suffering liver failure.
The pill also damaged the health of 20 more, including a well-recognized
Singaporean TV personality, who needed a liver transplant to survive.
On Thursday, South Korean officials said they were strengthening measures
to prevent imports of the pills. But Japanese officials warn crackdowns
could prove ineffective as long as demand is high and women are willing to
risk their health to lose weight.

[The chemical name of Fenfluramine HCl is
N-ethyl-alpha-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl) benzeneethanamine hydrochloride.
Fenfluramine as a single pharmaceutical agent appears to have some toxic
effects.
In the United States, fenfluramine and phentermine are anorectic agents
individually approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.
The drugs used in combination may yield equivalent efficacy in weight
reductions at lower doses of each agent and with fewer reported side
effects. In 1996, the total number of prescriptions in the United States
for fenfluramine and phentermine exceeded 18 million.
Valvular heart disease was identified in 24 women treated with
fenfluramine-phentermine (fen- phen) who had no previous history of cardiac
disease. Patients presented with symptoms or a murmur.
This article also highlights the issue that the use of "natural products"
implies safety. Likewise traditional Chinese medicine has been used in a
particular manner (for example, a tea or infusion), and changing the manner
(pills or capsules) of consumption does not necessarily imply safety. - Mod.TG]
