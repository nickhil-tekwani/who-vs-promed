- India (Chennai, Tamil Nadu state). 25 May 2012. Doctors in the city say they are starting to see patients infected with dengue [virus] and Corporation of Chennai, while continuing to deny that there have been cases in the city, has got into top disease prevention mode. Doctors in private hospitals and clinics say they are treating children for dengue, with the disease spreading much earlier this year [2012] than usual. The usual season for the fever, which has already claimed 29 lives in the southern districts in the past month, starts in August or during the monsoon. "We have been seeing at least one patient in 2 days over the past 2 weeks, but most of them recovered quickly," says Dr Geetha Hariharan of Surya Hospitals. "No patient has become critical so far or required to be hospitalised." With the rising death toll in the south and doctors detecting 1466 cases of the infection in Tamil Nadu, chief minister J Jayalalithaa on Wednesday [23 May 2012] instructed all districts including Chennai to immediately step up fogging and cleaning operations to stop the spread of the disease.
