I can provide the following background for plague in Mongolia, in
addition to that provided by Dr Berger (1 Aug 2000).
In 1910-11 the worst ever outbreak of pneumonic plague occurred in
Manchuria, and a strong circumstantial case was made for its origin in
bubonic cases resulting from processing sick marmots by fur hunters. The
disease was spread along Manchurian rail lines by Chinese migrant workers
returning to China after the hunting and agricultural seasons ended.
It claimed about 40 000 lives, without a single documented case of
survival. Much of what we know about pneumonic plague was the result of
study of this outbreak by an international team of scientists and
physicians.
The principal primary source for information is the difficult-to-find
"Report of the International Plague Conference" (Manila: Bureau of
Printing, 1912). There were also summary accounts that are more
accessible: R. Farrar, "Plague in Manchuria" Proceedings of the Royal
Society of Medicine, vol 5, part 2, 1-24 (1912); and G. D. Gray, "The
septicaemic and pneumonic outbreak in Manchuria and north China" The
Lancet, vol 180, 1152-1162 (1911). These make fascinating reading.
