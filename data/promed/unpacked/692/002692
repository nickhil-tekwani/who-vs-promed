The [annual] number of syphilis cases in Japan hit 6000 for the first time in 50 years this month [November 2018], and officials are rushing to nip the epidemic in the bud ahead of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. The problem is they have no idea what's causing it.

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, as of 19 Nov [2018], there have been 6096 cases of the sexually transmitted disease in the country [in 2018], the 1st time that number broke 6000 since 1970.

The highest number of syphilis patients were found in the capital metropolis of Tokyo, which had 1548; it was followed by 1043 in Osaka, 399 in Aichi, 314 in Kanagawa, and 272 in Fukuoka. The rest were scattered among the remainder of Japan's 47 prefectures, the Japan Times noted.

Authorities have tried a variety of methods to stem the tide of syphilis, which was believed to primarily affect the LGBTQ community until a recent set of studies proved the sharpest rise was among men who have sex with women and women who have sex with men. Methods have included mass distribution of contraceptives like condoms and a leaflet campaign in which anime character Sailor Moon pleads with people: "If you don't get tested, I will punish you!"

The South China Morning Post notes that authorities have been unable to identify the causes behind the spike in cases, although the publication noted that one Osaka doctor had floated the idea that male tourists utilizing the commercial sex industry had driven the increase. With Tokyo due to see millions of new visitors when it hosts the Summer Olympics in 2020, metropolitan officials aren't wasting time trying to get a handle on the outbreak.

Beginning next year [2019], Japan's Health Ministry will institute a mandatory reporting system for doctors, including the source of the infection. They will also be stepping up their contraception campaign, the Japan Times notes.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease spread by contact and caused by the _Treponema_ bacteria. It goes through distinct phases that begin with minor sores and ulcers around the genitals but, if left untreated, can progress to damage the patient's internal organs, including their heart and brain. The illness can be cured with a simple antibacterial medication if caught early but is difficult to treat in later stages.

Despite a high-profile education campaign that roped in the Sailor Moon anime character, syphilis infections are on the rise in Japan, where the number of cases this year [2018] has already hit a near 50-year high.

According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, 6096 cases had been reported as of 19 Nov [2018], the 1st time the annual total had surpassed 6000 since 1970. With a month still to go before the end of the year, the final total for 2018 will be significantly higher.

Most of the cases -- 1548 -- have been reported in Tokyo, followed by 1043 in Osaka and 399 in Aichi prefecture.

Given that Tokyo will host the Olympic Games in less than 2 years, there is concern that the disease will continue to spread, and the authorities have introduced initiatives to control a sexually transmitted disease that is not always readily identifiable.

The metropolitan government has set aside funds in its fiscal 2018 budget to pay for more free and anonymous testing programmes as well as to train more doctors in treating the condition.

This initiative follows a 2016 poster and leaflet campaign drawn up by the health ministry and featuring Sailor Moon. The Pretty Guardian, as she is known, appeared on more than 150 000 fliers and around 5000 posters declaring, "If you don't get tested, I will punish you!"

An additional 60 000 heart-shaped packages featuring an image of the anime star and containing a condom were distributed through local governments and at events to mark Coming of Age day in January [2017].

Syphilis was, in previous years, primarily a disease that affected the gay community, but ministry statistics suggest that the sharpest increases are being seen among women in their 20s and 30s and men aged between 20 and 60 years.

Japan's National Institute of Infectious Diseases released a report in late 2015 warning of a "substantial increase in female cases" of syphilis.

"The current situation warrants ongoing monitoring of trends in syphilis, and raising awareness among high-risk groups is imperative," the report states, adding that "early diagnosis and treatment are important".

The authorities have been reluctant -- or unable -- to identify the causes behind the increase in cases in recent years, although a doctor in Osaka was quoted in a recent edition of the weekly news magazine Friday [30 Nov 2018] as blaming the problem on the rising numbers of male tourists from other parts of Asia utilising the commercial sex industry.

Syphilis, caused by the _Treponema_ bacteria, is initially visible as minor sores or ulcers around the genitals or lips. The illness can be cured with anti-bacterial medication at this stage. If left untreated, however, the infection can cause inflammation of other parts of the body and lead to severe complications involving the heart and brain.

The illness is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, who can pass it on to their unborn child. Known as congenital syphilis, this can lead to a baby being stillborn or having a range of complications.

From January [2019], the health ministry will require doctors to report cases of syphilis in patients that have been passed on by sex workers. The ministry is also promoting the use of condoms in the sex industry and more regular health examinations.

[The United States has experienced a similar rising incidence of syphilis since 2000 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/sam/2017syphilis.htm). In 2000, primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis reached historic lows with less than 6000 reported cases and an incidence of only 2.1 cases per 100 000 people. However, in 2015, 23 872 P&S syphilis cases were reported with an incidence of 7.5 cases per 100 000 population, the highest rate reported since 1994. Syphilis rates increased in every region of the US, a majority of age groups, and across almost every race/ethnicity.

During 2000-2015, the rise in the rate of reported P&S syphilis in the US was primarily attributable to increased cases among men and, specifically, among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). In more recent years (2013-15), syphilis also increased among women. During 2014-2015, the rate increased 18.1% among men, but increased 27.3% among women (http://www.loopcayman.com/content/syphilis-cases-increase-1). Also, the increased rate of syphilis in women in the USA was associated with increasing rates of congenital syphilis. However, we are not told in the above news report if increasing rates of congenital syphilis are similarly rising in Japan. - Mod.ML
