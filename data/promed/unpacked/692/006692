Scrapie in Hungary in an imported animal
------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 14 Jan 2005 from Dr Tibor Balint, Chief Veterinary
Officer, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Budapest:
Report date: 13 Jan 2005.
Scrapie was confirmed in a sheep originating from Romania. This sheep aged
more than five years was imported into Hungary for immediate slaughter in
December 2004.
The animal was sampled within the framework of the National Monitoring
Programme for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy. The sample was
examined at the Central Veterinary Institute, Budapest, by rapid test on 16
Dec 2004 and the results were positive. Therefore, on 17 Dec the test was
repeated on samples from the obex and the cerebellum. The results were
positive in both cases. After the positive rapid test, all parts of the
animal in question (including the hide) were disposed of as specified risk
material. On 21 Dec, the State Veterinary Service of Romania was informed
of the positive rapid test.
On 12 Jan 2005, scrapie was confirmed on the basis of the positive results
of the confirmatory tests (histopathology and immunocytochemistry) carried
out at the Central Veterinary Institute. The State Veterinary Service of
Romania and the European Commission were also informed of the confirmation
of scrapie.
The Central Veterinary Institute will send a sample to the European Union
Reference Laboratory for further investigations.

[Scrapie was first announced in Romania and Slovakia in 2003 and in
Slovenia in 2004. Many of these new reports may be attributable to new
testing programs instituted by the EU -- see Mod.AS comments in Scrapie,
