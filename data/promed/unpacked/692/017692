Colorado has seen 15 human cases of tularemia reported in 2014, 5 times the annual average for the state. Tularemia-related small-mammal die-offs have been reported in at least 27 Colorado counties, including Summit.

Beavers found south of Breckenridge have tested positive for tularemia, a potentially life-threatening bacterial disease that can infect any warm-blooded animal, including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, hares, voles and beavers. Rodents, rabbits and hares are especially susceptible. An infection can be deadly in all species.

"We're encouraging Summit County residents and visitors to avoid handling sick or dead animals and to stay away from potentially contaminated areas, evidenced by the presence of dead animals," Summit County Public Health nurse Steph Stookey said in a written statement. "Given the rise in cases in 2014, it's important to take necessary precautions."

Of the 15 human cases reported so far this year [2014], 11 patients have been hospitalized.

Tularemia is a disease caused by the bacterium _Francisella tularensis_. Infected animals shed the bacterium in their feces and urine, and high numbers of bacteria are present in their carcasses. The bacterium can persist for long periods of time in water, soil and carcasses. Symptoms of the disease include, but are not limited to, high fever, open sores on the skin or mucous membranes, eye irritation and swelling, swollen lymph nodes, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing and chest pain. Blood tests and cultures can help confirm a diagnosis. Most infections can be treated successfully with antimicrobials.

[Finding _F. tularensis_ in beavers does not necessarily imply that any of the spate of human cases of tularemia were associated with direct or indirect beaver exposure.

The latest USA statistics on tularemia (CDC: Tularemia -- United States, 2001-2010. MMWR 2013; 62(47); 963-6 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6247a5.htm) indicate that a total of 1208 cases of tularemia were reported during 2001-2010. The median number of cases per year was 126.5, with a range of 90-154 cases per year. Of these 1208 reported cases, 64 percent were categorized as confirmed and 35 percent as probable. Median age of patients was 39 years (range: 1-92 years), and 68 percent were male. Average annual incidence was 0.041 cases per 100 000 persons. By age group and sex, annual incidence was highest among children aged 5-9 years (0.071) and among men aged 65-69 years (0.11). Cases were reported from 47 states. Six states accounted for 59 percent of reported cases: Missouri (19 percent), Arkansas (13 percent), Oklahoma (9 percent), Massachusetts (7 percent), South Dakota (5 percent), and Kansas (5 percent). Among the 10 states with the highest incidence of tularemia, all but Massachusetts were located in the central or western USA. Certain strains of _Francisella tularensis_ subspecies _tularensis_ (also known as type A) are associated with more severe disease and a greater risk for death. Mortality is less than 2 percent overall but ranges up to 24 percent depending on the strain.

As a category A bioterrorism agent, despite not being transmissible from person-to-person, in a fact sheet on tularemia (http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/idepc/diseases/tularemia/tularemia.html), WHO has estimated that 50 kg (110 lb) of tularemia bacteria released into the air over a city of 5 million people would cause very serious problems. WHO believes such an attack would cause about 250 000 cases of severe illness, and 19 000 deaths, a case fatality rate of about 7 percent.

Mortality is highest related to primary pneumonic disease or septicemia (typhoidal) with secondary pneumonia presentations, and a state such as Illinois with a low incidence of disease might contribute to mortality as it may not be considered early. - Mod.LL]

[In domestic animals, sheep are the primary host, but clinical infection has been reported in dogs, pigs, and horses. Cats are at increased risk due to predatory behavior and appear to have an increased susceptibility, while cattle appear to be resistant. Little is known of the true incidence and spectrum of clinical disease in domestic animals. Important wild animal hosts include cottontail and jackrabbits, beaver, muskrat, meadow voles, and sheep in North America, and other voles, field mice, and lemmings in Europe and Asia.

Natural foci of infection exist in North America and Eurasia, where the organism circulates between arthropod vectors and various mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Although found in every state except Hawaii, tularemia is most often reported in the southcentral and western USA (eg, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Montana).

Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with, or ingestion of, infected carcasses of wild animals (eg, cottontail rabbit) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional lymphadenitis), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (the wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (the lone star tick), _D variabilis_ (the dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (the deer fly).

The most common source of infection for people and herbivores is the bite of an infected tick, but persons who dress, prepare, or eat improperly cooked wild game are also at increased risk. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores may acquire infection from ingestion of an infected carcass. A few case reports have implicated cats as a source of infection in people.

Clinical Findings
The incubation period is 1-10 days. In sheep and most mammals, the disease is characterized by sudden onset of high fever, lethargy, anorexia, stiffness, reduced mobility, or other signs associated with septicemic disease. Pulse and respiratory rates are increased. Coughing, diarrhea, and pollakiuria may develop. Prostration and death may occur in a few hours or days. Sporadic cases are best recognized by signs of septicemia. Outbreaks in untreated lambs may have up to 15 percent mortality. Subclinical cases may be common.

Lesions
The most consistent lesions are miliary, white to off-white foci of necrosis in the liver and sometimes in the spleen, lung, and lymph nodes. Enlargement of the liver, spleen, lung, and lymph nodes is common. Organisms can be readily isolated from necropsy specimens by use of special media. Risk of infection during necropsy or to laboratory personnel is significant; special procedures and facilities are essential.

Diagnosis
Tularemia must be differentiated from other septicemic diseases (especially plague) or acute pneumonia. When large numbers of sheep show typical signs during periods of heavy tick infestation, tularemia or tick paralysis (see Tick Paralysis) should be suspected. Tularemia should be considered in cats with signs of acute lymphadenopathy, malaise, oral ulcers, and history of recent ingestion of wild prey.

Diagnosis of acute infection is confirmed by culture and identification of the bacterium, direct or indirect fluorescent antibody test, or a 4-fold increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent serum specimens. A single titer of greater than or equal to 1:80 by the tube agglutination test is presumptive evidence of prior infection. When tularemia is suspected, laboratory personnel should be alerted in order to reduce the risk of laboratory-acquired infection.

Treatment and Control
Streptomycin, gentamicin, chloramphenicol, and tetracyclines are effective at recommended dose levels. Gentamicin should be continued for 10 days. Because tetracycline and chloramphenicol are bacteriostatic, they should be continued for 14 days to minimize the risk of relapse. Early treatment should prevent death loss. Control is difficult and is limited to reducing tick infestation and to rapid diagnosis and treatment. Prolonged treatment may be necessary because many organisms are intracellular. Efforts are currently underway to develop a safe and effective vaccine. Recovery confers long-lasting immunity.
