One of today's [5 Nov 2018] cases is from Kalungata. It would be good to know more about this case. There were 2 cases there earlier -- in early September and early Oct. Ring vaccination was done. Did they miss a contact? Did a vaxxed person contract Ebola anyway? Are there missed cases there?]

[Weekly Bulletin on Outbreak and other Emergencies: Week 44: 27 Oct-2 Nov 2018, edited]
http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/275741/OEW44-271002112018.pdf

Event description
-----------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues. Since our last report on 26 Oct 2018 (weekly bulletin 43), 31 new confirmed EVD cases and 16 new deaths have occurred as of 3 Nov 2018. On 30 Oct 2018, Vuhovi, a health zone located between Butembo and Beni, reported one confirmed EVD case for the 1st time.

As of 3 Nov 2018, there have been a total of 296 EVD cases, including 263 confirmed and 35 probable cases. To date, confirmed cases have been reported from 10 health zones: Beni (139), Mabalako (73), Butembo (30), Masereka (4), Oicha (2), Kalunguta (2), Komanda (1) and Vuhovi (1) in North Kivu province; and Mandima (9), and Tchomia (2) in Ituri province. A total of 186 deaths were recorded, including 151 among confirmed cases, resulting in a case fatality ratio among confirmed cases of 57.4% (151/263). Since the last report, 3 new confirmed cases have been reported among health workers in Beni, increasing the number of health workers affected to 27, including 26 confirmed, and 3 deaths.

On 3 Nov 2018, 31 new patients were hospitalized, including 29 in Beni and 2 in Butembo, bringing the total number of patients admitted to 107 (70 suspected cases and 37 confirmed cases). As of 3 Nov 2018, the number of patients cured and discharged back into the community is 81 (including 11 new patients discharged since the last report).

Beni and Mabalako remain the most affected health zones, with 49.3% (147/298) and 31.5% (94/298) of cases, respectively. Beni is the current hotspot of the outbreak. There are also active chains of transmission in Butembo.

Contact tracing is still of concern due to insecurity and persistent community resistance. On 3 Nov 2018, the proportion of contacts followed was 92.3% (4599/5036).

Public health actions
---------------------
All surveillance activities continue, including investigations around the last confirmed cases not known as contacts, active case finding in health facilities and in the affected health zone communities and investigation and listing of contacts around the latest confirmed cases.

In Mabalako, multi-disciplinary teams of epidemiologists, communication and psychosocial care experts and clinicians visited the village of Kaukobo in connection with the confirmed case who escaped from the ETC in Beni and was found in Mabalako. Cases were transferred to Mangina ETC, contacts listed, the clinic at Kaukobo was decontaminated and the community around the village was sensitized.

There is continued monitoring at points of entry (POE) and sanitary control points (POS), with a total of 67 functional on 2 Nov 2018 (out of 66), with 187 809 travellers checked, bringing the total number of travellers checked since the start of the outbreak to 12.4 million.

A total of 15 transport vehicles were decontaminated the same day, bringing the total of decontaminated vehicles to 17 530. Vaccination continues in 9 rings in Beni, one in Kalunguta, one in Katwa, and one in Oicha (opened between 31 Oct 2018 and 2 Nov 2018) with a total of 275 people vaccinated on 2 Nov 2018, bringing the total number of people vaccinated since 8 Aug 2018 to 25 845.

Several activities were carried out to raise public awareness on EVD and to combat rumours about the disease and community resistance to the response measures to the epidemic. Door-to-door outreach sessions were conducted in Beni (n=410), Oicha (n=661), Mabalako (n=1 076), Butembo (n=756), and Masereka (n=76).

Psychoeducation sessions were carried out in Beni, Mabalako, Butembo, Mandima, and Masereka health zones reaching 920 people. 27 patients discharged from ETCs were re-integrated into their communities.

Infection prevention and control (IPC) and water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities continued: 11 IPC training sessions took place in health facilities, including 5 in Mabalako and 6 in Tchomia; a hygiene committee was established at Beni Reference General Hospital; 130 health workers were trained in Beni (12), Butembo (54), Mabalako (15), Komanda (33) and Tchomia (16); IPC kits were distributed in 2 health facilities, one in Beni and 1 in Butembo; 4 health facilities and 2 households in Beni were decontaminated.

Situation interpretation
------------------------
The EVD outbreak continues to be of grave concern, particularly with geographical spread of the disease to a new area, as well as the increasing number of confirmed cases and contacts to be followed in Beni. The current situation requires intensive and innovative measures to address the challenges on the ground. Intensified surveillance, including active case finding, case investigations, and identification and monitoring of all contacts is critical so that new suspected cases are isolated rapidly. Medical inputs and patient reception capacity at the ETCs also require expansion, in light of the increasing number of confirmed cases. Efforts to reinforce IPC capacities at all levels are paramount. All national and international actors need to continue to offer their strongest support to the continuing EVD response.

[2] Vaccine
- Mon 5 Nov 2018. Ebola vaccine technology could speed up development of other vaccines
https://www.devex.com/news/ebola-vaccine-technology-could-speed-up-development-of-other-vaccines-93774
[byline: Jenny Lei Ravelo]

Frontline health workers fighting the Ebola virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo could be protected from the virus for longer than 12 months, a new study has found.

Funded by the British government, the study was done among healthy volunteers who received a number of vaccines in the United Kingdom between 2014 and 2016. The vaccines included Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV, which was also used in the current outbreak in DRC; GlaxoSmithKline's ChAd3 EBOV; and Janssen's AdHu26.

After 2.5 years, the study found volunteers still have strong antibody response to the virus.

Katie Ewer, associate professor at the University of Oxford's Jenner Institute in the United Kingdom, and one of the study authors, said the findings lend insight into how the vaccines could be used in regions at risk of future Ebola outbreaks and to protect health care workers before the risk of infection becomes widespread.

"What we're trying to do with this study is understand how often we need to go and vaccinate these people. So by sharing that we have good persistence of immunity at 2 or 3 years, we know that the vaccine lasts at least that long, and we won't have to get back and reboost them," she told Devex.

"In a country like the DRC, where we know there are likely to be sporadic outbreaks, it would be great to go and vaccinate everybody who's a health care worker ... before an outbreak happens rather than using it reactively like we're doing now," she added.

And the researchers aren't stopping there. Their next plan is to give a booster dose to the very people who received the vaccines 3 years ago and find out how that adds to their immunity to the virus.

"Although we know that these immune responses are persisting, we'd like to know what happens if we give them another dose of vaccine. Would that mean that somebody who receives the vaccines gets protected say for 10 years? That's really important information because if we knew that we only needed to vaccinate, for example, every 10 years, then that massively reduces the cost of administering these types of vaccines to health care workers," Ewer said.

The Ebola crisis in West Africa has exposed how unprepared the world is to such outbreaks, leading to an urgency in finding a viable vaccine. But that urgency has opened up opportunities not just to address Ebola, but also other lethally infectious diseases for which no vaccines are currently available, Ewer said. ...[more]

- Mon 5 Nov 2018. Uganda: Government to deploy Ebola vaccine to health workers on DRC border
[All Africa, edited]
https://allafrica.com/stories/201811050183.html
[byline: Halima Athumani]

Uganda will begin administering the experimental Ebola vaccine to approximately 2000 health care and front-line workers along its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo on [Mon 5 Nov 2018], the Ministry of Health said.

Uganda has no confirmed cases of Ebola, but as the threat worsens in the DRC, the preventive measure is seen as necessary because of heavy border traffic. More than 20 000 people cross from the DRC into Uganda and back every week, the ministry says.

"The public high risk of cross-border transmission of Ebola to Uganda was assessed to be very high at national level," said Jane Ruth Aceng, Uganda's minister for health. "Hence, the need to protect our health workers with this vaccine. Currently in Uganda, we have 2100 doses of the vaccine available at the National Medical Stores and preparations are in high gear, including training of the health workers that are to be targeted."

Many of those crossing the border are from the DRC's North Kivu province, about 100 km (62 mi) from the Ugandan border, where armed conflict has made fighting the Ebola outbreak a challenge.

The vaccine, known as rVSV, has been used during recent outbreaks in Congo, Guinea and Sierra Leone, and is currently being dispensed in North Kivu.

Uganda's Health Ministry says the Ebola vaccine will be given with the consent of Uganda's health workers, since it is being used outside of clinical trials. Despite being experimental, the vaccine is absolutely safe, Aceng says. ...[more]

[Daily Monitor, edited]
https://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Government-starts-Ebola-vaccination-today/688334-4836902-13oydsx/index.html
[byline: Lilian Nanmagembe]

Uganda will today [Mon 5 Nov 2018], and for the very 1st time, start vaccination against the Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) as a preventive measure against the disease that has ravaged neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Dr. Jane Ruth Aceng, the Health minister, said only healthcare and frontline workers in the 5 high risk border districts who are prone to infection with the virus will receive the rVSV vaccine, starting today [Mon 5 Nov 2018].

"As a neighbour to the DRC, Uganda is on high alert due to the high risk of the Ebola threat," Dr. Aceng said on [Fri 2 Nov 2018]. Dr. Aceng also reiterated that there is no confirmed Ebola case in the country and an active case search continues in all communities, health facilities and at designated and informal border crossing in all districts.

The 5 districts identified by the government as most at risk include Kabarole, Bunyangabu, Kasese, Bundibugyo and Ntoroko.

Ebola broke out in DRC's north-eastern provinces in August [2018] and has killed close to 200 people and spread to areas close to Uganda. A thriving cross-border trade and social movements and events between relatives living on either side of the frontier has prompted the government to strengthen screening amid fears the deadly hemorrhagic fever could spill over into the country.

As of [1 Nov 2018], the DRC had registered a total of 285 Ebola cases, 250 confirmed and a total of 180 deaths. Another 41 suspect cases are under investigation. Dr. Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the WHO representative in Uganda, said the vaccine is safe with an efficacy level of 90% and starts working within 10 days from the time it's administered. It remains effective in the body for the next 12 months, he noted.

"There are no major risks recorded up to now. Once one is vaccinated, there could be just a normal reaction and that's why we follow up those who have been vaccinated," Dr. Tegegn said.

He also explained that the vaccine has been limited to a given portion of the population because it's very scarce. A total of 2100 doses of the vaccine donated by the US-based Merck Company through WHO are already in the country. Other African countries which have used the same vaccine include Guinea and the DRC.

[3] CDC warning
Date: Mon 05 Nov 2018.
Source: Washington Post [edited]
https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2018/11/05/cdc-director-warns-that-congos-ebola-outbreak-may-not-be-containable/?utm_term=.fc5b7127463a


Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said on [Mon 5 Nov 2018] that the Ebola outbreak in conflict-ridden Congo has become so serious that international public health experts need to consider the possibility that it cannot be brought under control and instead will become entrenched.

If that happened, it would be the first time since the deadly viral disease was first identified in 1976 that an Ebola outbreak led to the persistent presence of the disease. In all previous outbreaks, most of which took place in remote areas, the disease was contained before it spread widely. The current outbreak is entering its 4th month, with nearly 300 cases, including 186 deaths.

If Ebola becomes endemic in substantial areas of North Kivu province, in northeastern Congo, "this will mean that we've lost the ability to trace contacts, stop transmission chains and contain the outbreak," said Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, which hosted the briefing on Capitol Hill that featured the Ebola discussion with Redfield.

In that scenario, there would be a sustained and unpredictable spread of the deadly virus, with major implications for travel and trade, he said, noting that there are 6 million people in North Kivu. By comparison, the entire population of Liberia, one of the hardest-hit countries during the West Africa Ebola epidemic of 2014-2016, is about 4.8 million.

The outbreak is taking place in a part of northeastern Congo that is an active war zone. Dozens of armed militias operate in the area, attacking government outposts and civilians, complicating the work of Ebola response teams and putting their security at risk. Violence has escalated in recent weeks, severely hampering the response. The daily rate of new Ebola cases more than doubled in early October [2018]. In addition, there is community resistance and deep mistrust of the government. Some sick people have refused to go to treatment centers, health-care workers are still being infected, and some people are dying of Ebola or spreading the virus to new areas.

An estimated 60 to 80% of new confirmed cases have no known epidemiological link to prior cases, making it very difficult for responders to track cases and stop transmission. In late August [2018], the United States withdrew some of the CDC's most seasoned Ebola experts who had been stationed in Beni, the province's urban epicenter, because of security risks.

"I do think this is one of the challenges we'll have to see, whether we're able to contain, control and end the current outbreak with the current security situation, or do we move into the idea that this becomes more of an endemic Ebola outbreak in this region, which we've never really confronted," Redfield said.

If that happens, health-care responders may need to consider vaccinating broader populations instead of the current strategy of vaccinating those who have been in contact with infected people. When contact tracing begins to fall apart, "then you are entering another phase and losing the hope that you can arrest the outbreak through standard interventions," J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an interview. In a new report, Morrison wrote that there is an urgent need for "high-level political attention focused on generating an updated game plan" to improve security, train and deploy community health workers, and win community trust. "This is going to be a complicated and deeply problematic situation and we need to prepare ourselves for dealing with this long term," Morrison said.

Redfield, officials from the World Health Organization and other experts say one of the biggest worries is the spread within Congo to places like Butembo, a major trading port and urban area, where the risk of widespread transmission escalates dramatically.

In mid-October [2018], the World Health Organization said that it was "deeply concerned" by the outbreak but that the situation did not yet warrant being declared a global emergency. The U.N. health agency called for response activities to be "intensified." The WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and a top U.N. official for peacekeeping operations, are in Congo this week to take stock of the response.

[The dire prediction by the CDC Director Robert Redfield that the Ebola outbreak may no longer be containable, suggests that WHO should call a PHEIC immediately, which it stepped back from during its last meeting. But it may be too late since new chains of transmission are being missed. Endemic transmission of Ebola virus is not a manageable situation because of the highly infectious nature of the virus and its persistence in the body. A new approach to control will need to be undertaken to cover a much broader group of people than known contacts. - Mod.LK]

[4] Response
- Uganda: Ebola Preparedness Emergency Plan of Action
Mon 5 Nov 2018. International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies

Uganda: Ebola Preparedness Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) - DREF Operation n° MDRUG041 update n° 01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary of major revisions made to emergency plan of action
-----------------------------------------------------------
Following the confirmation of Ebola cases in Kashenyi at the shores of lake Albert in DRC, 40km [approx. 25 mi] from the landing site in Uganda about 3 weeks ago; and the continued conflict in Beni which has hampered the Ebola control efforts, the WHO risk level of the outbreak spreading to Uganda has been increased from high to very high nationally and regionally, but still seen low globally. This calls for strengthening and scaling up of current interventions.

At the national level in Uganda, it has been noted that it is a matter of when and not if the outbreak will occur, with WHO initiating preparations for safe and dignified burial (SDB) by training teams. However, it is not yet clear who will take a lead in managing SDB services in the country. Harnessing on the expertise and experiences of the Red Cross Movement in previous Ebola outbreaks in West Africa, URCS is positioning herself to lead SDB services in Uganda. There is therefore a need for additional surge capacity to support the development of a clear SDB strategy and plan that will guide interventions. An additional allocation of CHF 17 040 is being requested through this Operations Update to enable the deployment of an SDB expert and to support the ongoing mission of the CEA expert.

In addition, a strategy and planning expert will be deployed for 1 month, funded by the Norwegian Red Cross, to support the SDB strategy and plan.

A. Situation analysis

Description of the disaster
-------------------------
Following the declaration of the 9th Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak on [8 May 2018] by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ministry of Health, the WHO raised the alert for neighbouring countries, which share extensive borders, hosting DRC refugees and are used as corridors for DRC population movement. On [1 Aug 2018], just one week after the declaration of the end of the Ebola outbreak in Equator province, the 10th Ebola epidemic of the DRC was declared in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, which are among the most populated provinces in the DRC that also share borders with Uganda and Rwanda.

The provinces of North Kivu and Ituri have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis with over one million internally displaced people (IDPs) and a continuous efflux of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. Population mobility, including cross-border movements, were identified as a significant risk for disease transmission in this outbreak due to the high number of traders and miners, displaced populations and insecurity caused by rebels and militias in the area (Source IOM, 15 Aug 2018). Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu has hindered the implementation of response activities to control the EVD outbreak.

Based on this context, the public health risk is considered very high at the national and regional levels.

Since the EVD outbreak in DRC continues to spread, WHO has been sending Preparation Support Team (PST) missions to neighbouring countries of DRC to review EVD readiness and support preparedness strategies with government and other stakeholders including RC/RC National Societies. According to their risk profiles, the WHO has categorized 4 countries- Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan, and Burundi as Priority-1 for which EVD preparedness DREFs have all been approved for, and remaining 5 countries -- Angola, Congo, Central African Republic, Tanzania, and Zambia as Priority2. The prioritization was done based on their capacity to manage EVD and viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks, and their connections and proximity to the areas currently reporting EVD cases.

In the last week of September [2018], WHO increased the risk level for DRC EVD spread into Uganda from HIGH to VERY HIGH, due to the increased insecurity situation, which is hampering response activities. Cross-border activities have continued unabated with people from both sides of the borders participating in communal activities. There are some known Ugandans from Ntoroko district who were identified to have participated in the burial of a confirmed EVD case who died in Kasenyi in the DRC, one of whom was discovered at a construction site in Entebbe while 2 others remained untraced. This therefore requires extra vigilance in all activities, especially through heightened Points of Entry (PoE) screening and intensified community engagement.

The Uganda Red Cross has been supporting government preparedness efforts, coordinated through the national and district level Task Forces, in partnership with the Ministry of Health (MoH), UNICEF, IFRC and other partners, with the objective to prevent the importation of EVD into Uganda, building community resilience and building capacity to respond to a possible outbreak. URCS has been implementing preparedness activities with funding from UNICEF, WFP, IFRC (DREF and the epidemic preparedness program funded by USAID). The interventions are being implemented in the following 7 districts, which are identified as High-risk districts for a possible Ebola outbreak in the country: Kisoro, Kanungu, Kasese, Bundibugyo, Kabarole, Ntoroko and Bunyangabu.

Key URCS intervention activities include:
- Risk communication, community engagements and sensitization about potential risk of an EVD outbreak in Uganda.
- Support to EVD screening at 18 ground Points of Entry (PoEs).
- Psychosocial support implementation though training for volunteers.
- Infection, prevention and control (IPC) activities implementation, including Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB) if deaths from Ebola are reported.
- Transportation of suspected cases identified at community level and at PoE to the designated health facilities, and provision of discharge kits.

URCS, with support of partners have been supporting government efforts in updating EVD contingency plans and strategies in the early detection/surveillance of cross border population movement; training of volunteers to undertake EVD response activities such as IPC through training volunteers and health workers on preparing water, chlorine and jik solutions, disinfection and decontamination; risk communication; social mobilization and community engagement (CEA); Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB); Psychosocial support (PSS); and National Society capacity building and preparing for future outbreaks.

Potential risk factors for further EVD spread continue to exist not only at national level, but also at regional level including Uganda. The following factors are increasing the risk
- transport links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries
- internal displacement of populations
- low level of knowledge around Ebola modes of transmission, especially among women (according to a KAP survey done in North-Kivu)
- displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda.

The Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) has been participating in MoH led coordination meetings and engaging in preparedness activities such as reviewing EVD contingency plan, surveillance on cross border population movement and mobilization of people for potential response. The National Society has been coordinating with in-country Movement partners including IFRC, ICRC, Netherlands Red Cross, German Red Cross, Belgium Red Cross-Flanders, Austrian Red Cross and Canadian Red Cross for support in potential health, WATSAN, training of volunteers and CEA activities.

WHO, for its part, has been supporting URCS through the training of RC volunteers who have been deployed by the National Society to work in the most at risk districts. WHO and UNICEF are also supporting the National Society in developing risk communication tools and protocols for surveillance to be adopted both at community and PoE level and risks assessments for PoE.

The elevation of the EVD outbreak risk from high to very high calls for strengthening and scaling up of the current interventions. WHO initiated preparations for safe and dignified burial (SDB) by training of teams. Harnessing on the expertise and experiences of the Red Cross movement in previous Ebola outbreaks in West Africa and DRC, URCS is positioning itself to lead SDB services in Uganda. Two additional surge staff will be deployed to support URCS in the development of a clear strategy and plan, and to strengthen URCS SDB capacity. A revision of the DREF is expected after finalization of this SDB strategy and plan.

In response to the number of Ebola cases in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reaching 300, Oxfam's Country Director in the DRC, Chals Wontewe, said: "Three months on, mistrust and insecurity are making it extremely difficult to bring the Ebola outbreak under control - with the number of cases increasing by almost 80% in the last month alone.

"Years of protracted violence, forced displacement and severe hunger have led to mistrust among affected communities. Many people are still terrified to go to Ebola treatment centers. At the same time, violent attacks have meant that Oxfam and other agencies have had to suspend all activities. Every day that the response is suspended by violence could mean potential cases missed and people not vaccinated, undermining all the hard work to keep this outbreak under control.

"Much more must be done to put those affected by Ebola at the heart of the response to make sure all their concerns are heard and addressed."

Notes to editors:
Reports from the joint government and agencies surveillance commission show that the number of cases have increased by 78% between 1 Oct - 1 Nov 2018.

Since the beginning of the response to the Ebola Outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri, Oxfam is providing clean, safe drinking water and delivering Ebola prevention messages to the affected population. The response has been interrupted by several attacks by armed groups, roadblocks and gunfire.

A total of 7 civilians were reported killed in attacks in Beni this weekend [3 Nov 2018] while dozens of civilians were killed in attacks in the territory in October [2018].
