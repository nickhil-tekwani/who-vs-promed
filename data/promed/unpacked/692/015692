According to Tokyo Metropolitan Government, the vehicle of the foodborne illness, which affected more than 1000 teachers and students of 7 primary schools in Tachikawa city, [western part of Tokyo Metropolis], on 17 Feb 2017, was determined as shredded seaweed (kizami nori in Japanese) that was produced by a company in Osaka. The seaweed was served at lunch on 16 Feb 2017. Molecular biological tests revealed that the genotypes of the norovirus from one of the patients and that from the seaweed stored at a shop was matched. The Osaka city health department has already been informed of the findings.

According to Tokyo Metropolitan Government, there were 2 similar foodborne disease outbreaks occurred in Gobou city, Wakayama [prefecture] in late January [2017] and Kodaira city, [western part of Tokyo Metropolis], from [23-27 Feb 2017] the latter of which affected about 90 students and teachers who developed vomiting and diarrhea. In both settings, the identical seaweeds produced by the same company were served.

On 24 Feb 2017, the Tokyo metropolitan government concluded that the food poisoning outbreak of 7 elementary schools in Tachikawa City was caused by the meal prepared by a school lunch center and ordered the center not to supply meals for 3 days. Causative foods remain unclear. Tachikawa City suspended meals delivered by the center to 13 schools where the center had delivered meals, until the end of March [2017].

According to Tachikawa City, students, teachers and staff with vomiting and abdominal pain increased to 1098 persons at noon of 24 Feb 2017. 9 students were hospitalized and all have been discharged. Students of the 13 schools are asked to bring lunch boxes until the end of March 2017.

In the investigations by the Tokyo metropolitan government, norovirus was detected in feces samples from 40 persons. Students and so on contracted the disease after eating the same meal and presented syndromes like food poisoning since late-evening of 17 Feb 2017 although norovirus was not detected in samples from cooks nor from stored foods.

Food poisoning outbreaks with about 1000 cases in Tokyo had not occurred since 1978, when that occurred in Akigawa City (now part of Akiruno City [western part of Tokyo Metropolis]).
