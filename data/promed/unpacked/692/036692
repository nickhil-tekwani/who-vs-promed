The World Health Organization (WHO) announced today [7 Jul 2022] the the country of Ghana reported the preliminary finding of 2 cases of Marburg virus disease and if confirmed these would [be] the 1st such infections recorded in the country.

Preliminary analysis of samples taken from 2 patients by the country's Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research indicated the cases were positive for Marburg. However, per the standard procedure, the samples have been sent to the Institut Pasteur in Senegal, a WHO collaborating centre, for confirmation. The 2 patients from the southern Ashanti region -- both deceased and unrelated -- showed symptoms including diarrhea, fever, nausea and vomiting. They had been taken to a district hospital in Ashanti region.

Preparations for a possible outbreak response are being set up swiftly as further investigations are underway.

If confirmed, the cases in Ghana would mark the 2nd time Marburg has been detected in West Africa. Guinea confirmed a single case in an outbreak that was declared over on 16 Sep 2021, 5 weeks after the initial case was detected.

Previous outbreaks and sporadic cases of Marburg in Africa have been reported in Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.

[ProMED would greatly appreciate any additional information on the cases, as well as the results of the confirmatory testing. ProMED post 20210920.8687665 contains a WHO synopsis on advice for healthcare workers and suggested disease surveillance activities and precautions that should be taken in potentially affected areas. - Mod.JH

This is not the 1st time that Marburg virus has been found in West Africa. Last year (2021) there were 2 confirmed cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Gueckedou, the Republic of Guinea. Although these were the 1st confirmed human infections with this virus in West Africa, the virus was found previously in neighboring Sierra Leone in 5 Egyptian rousette, or fruit, bats (_Rousettus aegyptiacus_) (see Marburg virus disease - Sierra Leone: bat 20200125.6916732 and Amman BR, Bird H, Bakarr IA, et al. Nat Commun. 2020; 11: 510; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14327-8).

Tests for Marburg virus infections should be among those for hemorrhagic diseases that are endemic in West Africa for timely and accurate differential diagnosis. - Mod.TY
