Nigeria has recorded more than 88 704 cholera cases and 3208 deaths in 2021. Abubakar Kende, secretary-general of the Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), made the disclosure at an ongoing 3-day workshop on prevention of cholera in Abuja yesterday [26 Oct 2021].

He added that "the NRCS, in consultation with the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and support from International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) is commencing emergency relief action in 5 states. The intervention will take place in Sokoto, Katsina, Kebbi, Gombe and Bayelsa states to slow down the rising cholera cases."

According to him, recent NCDC Cholera Situation Report in 31 out of 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) indicates suspected cases in 2021. He said that "the NCDC Emergency Response Centre indicates that cholera in Nigeria in 2021 surpassed the total case count for 2020 and 2019."

Kenda explained that the society and stakeholders called on government and international partners to assist in intensifying the response to save lives and curb the spread of the epidemic. In addition to the 5 states, he said the Independent Committee of the Red Cross was also supporting the control and prevention in Adamawa, Borno and Yobe. According to him, many government agencies are being overwhelmed with COVID-19, which resulted in low attention to cholera. He advised that relevant stakeholders should create awareness on access to clean water and proper sanitation.

Mr. Bhupinder Tomar, head of delegation, Abuja Cluster, IFRC, noted that there was urgent need to address the issue of cholera. Tomar said the federation would provide short-term solutions for immediate reduction in mortality rate. He emphasized the need to educate communities on adherence to the practice of good hygiene, assuring that the federation would provide opportunities for stakeholders to immediately address the cholera issue. "We need to educate communities to get prepared before the next 6 months against future occurrence," he added.

Mr. Nura Ydda, project monitoring evaluation and reporting officer, Kebbi State, said he would ensure the messages were translated into the Hausa language. He said Kebbi communities would learn and understand better when the messages are in their dialects.

According to District Health Director Angel Mubanga, there has been an outbreak of diarrhea disease in the district with 2 deaths reported so far and 637 cases recorded, state-run news agency, the Zambia News and Information Service (ZANIS) reported.
