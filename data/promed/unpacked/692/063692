This distressing episode [reported in ProMED-mail post 20140825.2721553] has reached our attention only because the person involved was from the Netherlands. How many others in Chennai got bitten by the same dog and how many other dogs were rabid in Chennai will never be known, for want of a case-based surveillance system in India. I had been ardently advocating for such a disease surveillance system and had developed a simple, inexpensive and efficient model in Vellore district [Tamil Nadu state] (John TJ et al Disease surveillance at district level: a model for developing countries. Lancet 1998;352:58-61) and replicated it in Kottayam district [Kerala state] (John TJ et al. Communicable diseases monitored by district level surveillance in Kottayam district in Kerala, India. Indian J Med Res 2004; 120:86-93) in the 1990s. India cannot progress in public health without reviving such public health surveillance which is integral to any disease control.

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in this instance ought to have included, as rightly pointed out by the moderator, rabies immunoglobulin -- often withheld from Indian patients by the physician for saving money -- since most people pay out of pocket for healthcare, and rabies immunoglobulin is more expensive than rabies vaccine. That is false justification that has become routine practice, illustrated by this case.

With the availability of safe vaccines, I recommend pre-exposure rabies immunisation for wide usage. In my family all have been so immunised. For planned visit to India, rabies prophylaxis could be life-saving. Alternatively, advice by travel clinics should include a leaflet demanding complete post-exposure treatment, so that it is not left to the doctor who may not be well-versed with the problem.

[To which I replied: Many thanks for your informed comments. While pre-exposure vaccination has its place in protecting those at high risk, e.g., veterinarians, it may well be too expensive for the general population. I suspect that there could be a strong argument for it with eco-tourists. On the other hand I have long held that any human rabies cases are the responsibility of the veterinary services because canine control of rabies through vaccination is cheap, well-proven, and not complicated. Frankly, in my book, urban rabies control is so straightforward that it is the equivalent of bovine mastitis control in dairy herds; any large animal veterinarian can do the latter, so any public health veterinarian should be able to do the former. Rural rabies control can be more complicated and especially if wildlife, e.g., foxes, raccoons, skunks, are involved as this necessitates the deployment of oral vaccine bait. - Mod.MHJ]

I do not dispute. My "wide use" includes all family members who own pet dogs; people with outdoor type hobbies; and other motivated persons who can afford. This applies to high prevalence countries like India, without effective rabies control in dogs. Cell culture vaccines are only 3-4 dollars a dose. 20 000 deaths are unacceptable.

Let me quote from a paper I wrote for a talk: "There are an estimated 15 million dog bites annually, for 17/1000 persons/year. The majority are on the street: so are agencies that maintain roads accountable to sterilize and vaccinate dogs? In real life, no one accepts accountability. Perhaps a test case in the court might enable the judiciary to fix accountability.

"There is another obvious, realistic, intervention against human rabies: routine rabies immunisation. The annual 20 000 rabies deaths account mostly for untreated rabid dog bites and partly treatment failures. It is reasonable to assume that about 80 percent of human rabies is prevented by 'post-exposure rabies treatment' with rabies vaccine (in selected cases rabies antibodies also). In other words, among a total of about 100 000 persons who would have developed rabies if left untreated, 80 percent are rescued by treatment, but 20 percent die. India's renowned rabies expert, late Dr N Veeraraghavan, had shown that only a quarter of bites of rabid dogs actually result in human rabies even if left untreated. In other words, the total number of bites by truly rabid dogs would amount to about 400 000 every year. A survey in 2007 had estimated that 500 000 persons are given post-exposure treatment. India's annual birth cohort is 26 million. The life time risk, therefore, of rabid dog bite, is about 1 in 50. The risk is not evenly distributed but skewed more towards children and adults who spend long periods on the streets. Particularly for them, routine vaccination against rabies is a realistic option, provided the State pays for the same. If the State purchases vaccine the price will crash.

"Modern human rabies vaccines are completely safe and highly effective in preventing rabies. Vaccine can be given routinely for protection against future risk of rabies. This is called 'pre-exposure prophylaxis'. Vaccination after dog-bite is 'post-exposure treatment'. Veterinarians and pet owners usually take pre-exposure prophylaxis for personal safety. If we have a 1 in 50 life time risk of rabid dog bite, the best solution to prevent human rabies is routine rabies immunization."

In India, "you are on your own," and a family with a single child or 2 should give all reasonable vaccines and that may include rabies vaccine. This is my personal opinion.

[Human vaccination alone is reactive and therefore does little, other than saving human lives, to reduce the basic threat of canine rabies, the source of the infection. Slack off and the human deaths will surge back as rabid dogs are still biting. But canine vaccination programmes get ahead of the problem and show very significant benefits within 3 years. The PAHO experience in Latin America is that it eradicates urban rabies. But it takes organising skills and dependable funding. And in the meantime you can vaccinate those humans at risk. But I must admit I am biased; I am very much against even sporadic canine rabies. - Mod.MHJ
