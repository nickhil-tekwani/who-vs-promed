Threat of outbreak of cutaneous anthrax minimized
-------------------------------------------------
The Governor of Michoacan, Lazaro Cardenas Batel, has stated that there is
no risk that the outbreak of skin anthrax detected in a community of that
state will propagate to the rest of the population. It is not a large
outbreak and there is no cause for alarm as it has been confirmed that the
individuals affected acquired the infection through contact with a dead animal.
Cardenas Batel further explained that this is not pulmonary anthrax, which
can cause serious illness and death in some people, but a perfectly
controllable and limited type of [cutaneous] anthrax. The state health
department reported that the 4 victims registered are in stable condition
in hospitals of Morelia and Patzcuaro. Cardenas Batel confirmed that the
outbreak originated in the community of Santa Rita, in the municipality of
Salvador Escalante.
According to the official report, the host animal was a calf that was
skinned by 6 members of 2 local families. Until 17 June, 4 people,
including one woman, presented symptoms of skin anthrax [Onset of the first
case was Sat 14 Jun 2003, according to an earlier report. - Mod.JW]
The governor insisted that, of course, there is cause for concern and that
the situation must be addressed, but that it is not an alarming case. The
state authorities have already reported the outbreak to Mexico's health
secretary, Julio Frenk Mora. State health workers visited the area where
the outbreak originated and confirmed that there are no additional cases of
infection.
The most severe case is a 44 year old man who had to undergo surgery to
restore blood circulation in his right arm. The procedure was performed in
the Hospital Civil de Morelia. The other patients are between 22 and 27
years old and remain under observation in private hospitals.

[Mexican data on anthrax may be affected by the following phenomenon. I
have been told by a number of clinicians that, if they refer samples to
their local diagnostic laboratory, the government response is over-keen to
quarantine. Therefore their clients insist that the livestock disease be
diagnosed privately and thus by their veterinarian purely on the basis of a
stained fixed blood smear. Thus the diagnostic laboratories rarely receive
suitable samples. The numbers bear this out. In 2001, 4.5 million head of
cattle were vaccinated out of the 30.5 million head national herd; in
previous years the numbers, when reported to the Office International des
Epizooties varied between 2.5 and 3.5 million vaccinated annually. The
numbers of bovine herds reported affected with disease are usually in low
single digits, but 20 herds were affected in 1998, 12 in 1997, and 36 in 1989.
This is an over-enthusiastic vaccination response if the disease is as rare
as the official statistics indicate. The situation in sheep is essentially
ignored. In recent years the disease has begun to be reported in pigs,
which indicates either that pig feed has been contaminated or that pigs
have been eating fallen cattle. I suspect the former as the latter is not
unusual in rural areas anywhere in the world. Also if infected carcasses
are being recycled through renderers faulty sterilisation results in new
cases. This news report provides no information on a government veterinary
service response.
No prior human cases have been reported to the World Health Organization in
the past decade. Calves are seldom affected with this disease, not from an
innate resistance but from lack of exposure as they are suckling and are
not very vigorous grazers. I would not be surprised if this animal was one
of several animals affected in the same outbreak. Physicians, when treating
this disease, get impatient because of the normally slow healing process.
This can result in unnecessary surgery. It always amazes me how well the
sometimes horrific anthrax lesions heal with proper antibiotic treatment. -
