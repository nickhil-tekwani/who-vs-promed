Cambodia reported on Wednesday [13 Feb 2012] that another 4-year-old girl has contracted avian influenza H5N1 [virus infection], becoming the 7th person who infected the virus in 2013.

Dr Denis Laurent, deputy director of Kantha Bopha Children's Hospital, which is the kingdom's largest pediatric hospital, said the victim is from Angkor Phnom Touch commune, Angkor Chey district of Southwestern Kampot province. She has received medical treatment at the hospital in Phnom Penh since last Wednesday [6 Feb 2013]. "Now, her condition is stable," he told Xinhua over telephone on Wednesday [13 Feb 2013].

So far this year [2013], 5 of 7 confirmed human H5N1 cases have been fatal.

The country sees the worst outbreak of the virus this year since the disease was first identified in January 2004. To date, the country has recorded 28 human cases of the virus, killing 24 people.

[Of the 7 cases of avian A/(H5N1) virus infection confirmed in Cambodia in 2013, all have been children, and the majority female. A correspondent also reminded the moderator recently that 24 of the 27 (now 28) confirmed Cambodian cases of avian A/(H5N1) have had a fatal outcome. Perhaps more should be done to educate the Cambodian population (especially young children) to stay away from sick chickens.
