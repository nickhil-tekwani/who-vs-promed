Toronto man dies from virus picked up in New York
-----------------------------------
An elderly Toronto man has died days after he contracted a rare
virus in New York City -- a disease never before seen in the
Western Hemisphere that has already killed at least 4 other people
in the American city.
Dr. Chuck Le Ber, a senior veterinary consultant with the Ontario
Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, has identified the case as
the first case of its kind in Canada.
The viral disease, known as the West Nile strain, is transmitted to
humans from mosquitoes that have bitten infected birds. The
ailment is particularly lethal to infants and the elderly, whose
immune systems are not as strong. The American fatalities have all
occurred in elderly people.
The 75-year-old Canadian man was in a coma in an intensive care
unit of an Etobicoke hospital until he died last Saturday. Blood
samples of the victim are currently undergoing tests in Winnipeg.
Like the American victims, the virus contracted by the Canadian
was at first mistaken for St. Louis encephalitis.
"There is one case in Toronto of the West Nile outbreak," said Dr.
Harvey Artsob, chief of zoonotic diseases, which are ones
transferred from animals to humans, for Health Canada.
The Canadian man, who has not been identified, is believed to have
contracted the virus after being bitten by a mosquito. He returned to
Canada from a weekend visit to Queens in early September.
Dr. Artsob said it is unlikely that anyone in Canada could contract
the virus from a mosquito. "It is near the end of the mosquito
season and the weather is turning colder. So at this late date we
don't think there is going to be any outbreak here in Canada," he
said.
