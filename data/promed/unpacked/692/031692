re: ProMED-mail. Mycobacteriosis, rockfish - USA (MD)(02) 20060319.0853
-----------------------------------------------
_Mycobacterium marinum_ gets the blame in general, based on default. For
the most part, isolation of the infective agent from fish or other
organisms is not performed, and the causative agent is presumed to be _M.
marinum_.
We can't predict what species of mycobacteria will be found in other
species of fish, but based on our work in Chesapeake Bay, the 2 new species
that are most frequently isolated (and described in the references below)
are called _M. shottsii_ and _M. pseudoshottsii_. We named the 1st species
after Emmett Shotts, retired fish microbiologist.
_M. marinum_ occurs at a frequency of 5 per cent or less. Frequencies of
occurrence for the new species (including coinfections) are 57 and 12 per
cent, respectively. Based on surveys in the mainstem and tributaries of the
Bay, the prevalence of mycobacteriosis in striped bass runs about 70 per cent.
The consequences of this disease to the striped bass stocks are presently
unknown and limited, but focused studies are now being conducted by
colleagues at VIMS [Virginia Institute of Marine Science] and the Eastern
Fish Health Laboratory to address this question.
If you need additional information, please don't hesitate to contact either
of us.

[We thank Drs Kator and Rhodes for informing us about the new species of
mycobacterium that have been discovered in the striped bass. As their
research progresses and they learn the extent of the infection, and perhaps
ways to control it in the Chesapeake Bay, we look forward to continued
learning and their shared information. - Mod.TG]
