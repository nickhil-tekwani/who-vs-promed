On June 17, 1999, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control (LCDC), Health
Canada, was advised by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) that the State of Alaska had reported that several persons were
hospitalized for pneumonia and/or severe influenza-like illness (ILI).
Influenza A was subsequently isolated and specimens are being sent to the
CDC for strain characterization. At the same time several cruise ships
reported outbreaks of influenza-like illness; to date, all these have
occurred among passengers who were southbound from Alaska following land
tours in that State. Alaska has reported that ILI activity appeared to be
widespread among persons who work in the land tour business. In addition,
the Yukon Territory has just reported 4 culture-confirmed cases of
influenza A (3 of them in tourists).
This is the earliest that influenza activity has ever been detected in the
Northern Hemisphere during the summer months. At present, reports of
respiratory illness are primarily associated with groups of tourists
sharing transportation and accommodation on overland tours in the region.
After touring inland, some ill travellers are boarding cruise ships
contributing to limited spread among other cruise passengers and crew
members.
The risk of exposure to influenza during travel depends on the time of
year, destination and type of travel (e.g., large, organized tourist
groups). In the tropics, influenza can occur throughout the year. In
temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, most activity occurs from
April through September. In the Northern Hemisphere, influenza generally
occurs from November through March.
Several factors may account for the emergence and spread of influenza and
ILI early this summer. First, there has been an increasing volume of
travellers from all over the world who visit this region, particularly on
board cruise ships sailing the West Coast, often in conjunction with
land-based tours (by bus or train) in Alaska, British Columbia and the
Yukon Territory.
Immunity to the strains of influenza virus covered by the
vaccine-administered in the late fall or early winter-probably wanes after
4-6 months, which means that some vaccinated persons likely are susceptible
again the following summer. Vaccinated persons remain susceptible to the
influenza strains not covered by the vaccine, and to non-influenza
organisms that cause ILI.
Another important factor is that on cruise ships, and on bus or train
tours, large numbers of people co-exist in relatively confined spaces,
which may facilitate the transmission of influenza and other respiratory
organisms.
Finally, the demographic profile of the tourists may facilitate influenza
transmission. Compared to the general population, there is usually a higher
proportion of older adults travelling on cruise ships. While many may have
had the influenza vaccine, the risk of serious complications from influenza
infection is greater in a senior population.
The cruise ship industry-following advice by Canadian and US public health
authorities-has recognized in recent years the importance of reducing the
risk of spread of influenza, for example, by having the ships' crews and
hospitality staff vaccinated. The industry has also established ongoing
surveillance and is prepared to provide appropriate measures to reduce the
severity of illness among both passengers and crew.

From: David Morens <dm270q@nih.gov>

This Canadian report is supplemented by a report in a recent issue of CDC's
MMWR (Volume 48, number 25, 2 July 1999, pp. 545,546,555), discussing 428
suspected cases in Alaska/Yukon Territory occurring between 22 May and 28
June 1999.
In fact, summer occurrence of influenza A is not rare, and has been
documented in the Northern Hemisphere for centuries. The general
hemispheric seasonality of influenza and unrelated respiratory viral
diseases has long been a subject of speculation. Thus, there is little new
in this report other than the fact that it serves as a "re-reminder" about
influenza risks in travelers. It seems reasonable to suspect that as the
frequency and distance of air and ground travel increases globally,
exceptions to influenza seasonality will become increasingly common. For
this reason, physicians treating persons with febrile illnesses, or
counseling travelers about health measures, should be aware of the nature
of influenza risk, particularly in distant and international group travel
settings where exposures to multiple persons in close confined settings are
likely.
CDC recommendations in response to the current Alaska/Yukon outbreak
reflect general and accepted influenza prevention practices, and also
suggest that treating physicians maintain a high index of suspicion, and
that they consider administration of amantadine or rimantadine within 48
hours of illness onset. While vaccine prevention is always preferable to
drug treatment, the CDC guidelines recognize that US/Canada formulations of
influenza vaccine may not be readily available in the summer, that
vaccine-induced immunity from the previous winter may have waned, and that
prevention and treatment in travelers and travel groups requires public
health and medical emphasis because of increased exposure risks, as well as
the combination of low vaccine efficacy and age-related susceptibility to
influenza complications in older travelers.
