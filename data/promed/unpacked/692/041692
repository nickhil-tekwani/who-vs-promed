Venezuela malaria cases have doubled in Venezuela so far this year
[2010] as health officials confront an epidemic in a vast southern
region where wildcat gold miners are often infected in remote jungle
camps.

Health Ministry statistics published this week show there have been
21 601 malaria cases nationwide so far this year [2010], up from 10
758 during the same period last year.

A vast majority of the patients, 19 750, were diagnosed in southern
Bolivar state, where government officials say there is an epidemic.
The statistics, which are updated weekly and circulated among some
health officials, cover the period running from the start of the year
2010 through 22 May 2010.

Miners in search of gold and diamonds have long caught the disease by
venturing into forests where malaria-carrying mosquitoes live. Their
strip-mines destroy patches of forest, leaving behind muddy pools and
water contaminated with the mercury they use to separate gold from
rock.

Public health officials attribute the rise in malaria cases in part
to a government-led operation this year [2010] in which soldiers have
evicted thousands of miners from their illegal strip-mines. That has
led to a movement of displaced miners to other towns, and they have
carried the disease with them and helped it spread into areas that
didn't have much malaria before, said Dr. Ana Gineth Morales, who
heads the Bolivar state Public Health Institute.

"We expected it. It hasn't taken us by surprise," Morales said in a
telephone interview Friday [4 Jun 2010], saying her agency had been
fully prepared. "We've been efficient in diagnosing and detecting,"
she said, adding that officials have largely managed to avoid deaths
this year [2010], except for a single man in Bolivar, an elderly
miner who died in January 2010 from malaria and complications from
other health problems. Last year [2009], she said, one Brazilian
woman died of malaria in the state.

Morales said there has been an epidemic in parts of Bolivar since
February 2010. She expressed confidence that cases should eventually
decline sharply as the government continues to root out illegal
miners through its "Plan Caura" operation.

But some critics say the malaria situation appears to be out of
control. "We expect malaria cases will keep increasing," said Dr.
Angel Granados, of the Bolivar state Medical Association. He said
there are various factors contributing to the rise, including recent
rains and movement of miners, but also "failures in control and
prevention" measures by state health officials. Public health teams
haven't been reaching many remote areas, including indigenous
communities, to detect and treat cases, Granados said.

Bolivar state has long been the epicenter for malaria in Venezuela,
and the disease has been on the rise for the past few years. The
country is on track this year [2010] to surpass the 2009 nationwide
total of 35 725 cases, which also was an increase from 31 719 cases
in 2008, according to Health Ministry figures.

Granados said there have recently been problems trying to supply
medications to so many patients. "It worries all of us in the
hospitals," he said. Granados said one Yekuana Indian community
earlier this year [2010] reported 6 deaths -- including 3 children
and 3 adults -- that came after they suffered high fevers, and
appeared to be due to malaria. But he said state health officials
ruled out malaria, saying the deaths were due to other causes, and
did not include them in their tally.

[Malaria is well known in the Bolivar region of Venezuela. A recent
study (Gomez et al., Malaria and pregnancy. San Isidro parish,
municipality Sifontes, state of Bolivar, Venezuela, 2005-2006 Invest
Clin. 2009;50:455-64) of 449 women found an incidence in pregnant
women of 27.4 percent: 87 percent for _Plasmodium vivax_, 12.2
percent _Plasmodium falciparum_ and 0.8 percent mixed infections.
71.5 percent had symptoms, and 26.2 percent had anemia. A higher
proportion of abortions occurred among infected mothers with
_Plasmodium vivax_ (3/5); and there were 3.3 percent low-birth-weight
neonates. A recent review of malaria in the Amazon region of
Venezuela concluded that the malaria slide positive rate had been
stable at around 15 percent for more than 2 decades (Metzger et al.,
A rapid malaria appraisal in the Venezuelan Amazon. Malar J.
2009;8:291), but it could be missing the present outbreak using
official data not yet made publicly available. - Mod.EP]
