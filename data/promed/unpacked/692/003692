The moisture in the atmosphere has promoted the development of a fungus that sickens the soursop tree [in Puerto Rico]. According to the agronomist Jose L. Zamora Echevarria, the fruit and leaf may be affected by anthracnose.

The fungus affects the soursop in 2 ways: the fruit became mummified, turns black, falls, and stops developing; secondly, a black stain can appear on its shell during any part of its development, and the fruit will rot once it's mature. The leaves, he said, develop a dark brown or black stain.

[Soursop (_Annona muricata_) and other species and hybrids in the genus (such as cherimoya and custard apple) are important cash crops and dietary components of local populations. Soursop is native to the tropical regions of the Americas and is widely propagated.

Anthracnose of soursop is caused by fungi in the genus _Colletotrichum_ (including _C. gloeosporioides_, _C. fructicola_). Symptoms may include necrotic lesions on leaves, shoots and fruits; dieback of branches; necrosis of flowers; premature drop, mummification and cracking of fruits. Disease development is usually favoured by humid conditions. Economic losses are due to reduced yield and severe reduction of product quality before and after harvest.

Anthracnose fungi are spread mainly by infected plant material, mechanical means (including human and insect activity) and splashing rain. They have a long saprophytic survival ability on crop residues. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, cultural techniques, phytosanitation and resistant varieties, if available. Fungicides may help to delay the onset of epidemics in some crops, but usually cannot prevent their development.
