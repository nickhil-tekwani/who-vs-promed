Two cases of diphtheria have been confirmed in the Lothian area, the Herald [revealed]. Both individuals, who are believed to be receiving treatment for the disease in an Edinburgh hospital, had recently returned to Scotland after travelling abroad.

[Diphtheria] was once a major cause of death in the UK but is now extremely rare due to high uptake rates for the childhood vaccine. One of the last major outbreaks in Scotland was in 1968, when 6 members of the same household in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, fell ill. Two died.

A spokeswoman for Health Protection Scotland confirmed they were aware of 2 cases of diphtheria but said NHS Lothian were "dealing with this at a local board level."

NHS Lothian stressed that the likelihood of any additional cases was "very small" due to high immunisation rates.

Since 2015, there have only been 5 other cases reported in Scotland.

Alison McCallum, director of public health at NHS Lothian said: "Two related cases of diphtheria have been confirmed in the Lothian area, with both patients having recently returned from abroad. "All close contacts of these patients have been identified, contacted and followed up in line with nationally agreed guidelines. "The likelihood of any additional cases is very small, as most people are protected by immunisation given in childhood. "In Lothian, 98% of children are vaccinated against diphtheria by the age of 24 months.

"We encourage people travelling abroad to visit [NHS website] Fit for Travel where they can access information on how to stay safe and healthy abroad, as well as destination specific health advice."

Before mass immunisation was introduced in 1942, there were more than 60 000 cases of diphtheria a year in Britain and over 4000 deaths annually. Diphtheria can also attack the heart, causing fatal heart failure, or the nerves, leading to neurological damage.

In the UK, infants and children are routinely offered the 6-in-one vaccine to protect against diphtheria as well as hepatitis B, whooping cough, polio, tetanus and haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Uptake by age 5 averages 98.2% in Scotland, according to the latest figures.

However, the disease remains common in some parts of the world including Asia, the South Pacific, the Middle East, eastern Europe and the Caribbean. Anyone travelling to areas with high rates of diphtheria is advised to have a booster jab if they have not been vaccinated in more than 10 years.

[Diphtheria, a life-threatening, vaccine-preventable infection caused by toxin-producing _Corynebacteria_ species, which include _C. diphtheriae_, _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_. _C. ulcerans_ and _C. pseudotuberculosis_, are zoonotic pathogens that can carry the same bacteriophage that encodes diphtheria toxin as do toxigenic strains of _C. diphtheriae_ and produce diphtheria toxin. Diphtheria became rare in England following the introduction of mass immunization in 1942, when the average annual number of cases was about 60 000 with 4000 deaths (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/788746/hpr1019_dphthr.pdf). From January to December 2018, 11 toxigenic strains of _Corynebacteria_ were reported in England; 8 _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ and 3 _C. ulcerans_.

_Corynebacterium diphtheriae__ is an aerobic gram-positive bacillus with 3 biotypes: gravis, intermedius, and mitis. _C. diphtheriae_ causes respiratory tract or cutaneous diphtheria. Toxin production occurs only when the bacillus is infected (lysogenized) by a specific bacteriophage that carries the gene encoding the toxin. The toxin is responsible for the major complications, myocarditis (e.g., cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure) and neuritis (e.g., paralysis of the soft palate, eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm).

Humans are the only reservoir of _C. diphtheriae_. Transmission of _C. diphtheriae_ can occur through respiratory droplets, direct contact with cutaneous infections, and articles soiled with discharges from the respiratory tract or skin lesions. Organisms can be shed for up to 4 weeks without antibiotics, but chronic carriers may shed organisms for 6 months or more. Effective antibiotic therapy promptly terminates shedding. The organisms can survive in dust and clothing for up to 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/dip.pdf). Shedding from cutaneous lesions can cause respiratory and cutaneous infections in contacts.

Lothian is a region of the Scottish Lowlands, lying between the southern shore of the Firth of Forth and the Lammermuir Hills and includes Edinburgh City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothian). Edinburgh, with a population in 2013 of 487 500, is the capital of Scotland and is located on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh).
