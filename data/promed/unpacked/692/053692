2 Ho Chi Minh City pediatric hospitals reported [14 Jan 2010] they
have admitted several children with suspected Kawasaki disease that
could lead to heart-related complications. The exact cause of the
disease is not known despite much research, but the children have
symptoms like redness and swelling of the lips, tongue, and oral
mucous membrane, dark rings around the eyes, and high fever. It
typically affects kids below 5.

The cardiac ward at Children Hospital I has up to 3 children to a bed.
Most had been diagnosed with dengue fever by small clinics in their
districts. Doctors at the hospital said until 5 years ago there were
around 20 cases a year. But the disease is in an uptrend, with the
number going past 100 last year [2009].

Medical experts said Kawasaki is a dangerous disease that can lead to
serious complications of the heart. The fatality rate is around one
per cent and half of patients died during the 1st 2 months. The
disease is named after Dr Tomisaku Kawasaki, the Japanese doctor who
first identified it in 1967, Dr Vu Minh Phuc, head of the cardiac ward
at Children Hospital I, said.

[The symptoms of the disease are persistent fever, rash, swelling of
the hands and feet, irritation and redness of the whites of the eyes,
swollen lymph glands in the neck, and irritation and inflammation of
the mouth, lips, and throat. Serious complications include coronary
artery dilatations and aneurysms. It mostly affects boys and younger
children, with the highest incidence in Japan. It may have seasonality
trend during winter-spring.

The case definition of the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (US CDC) for epidemiologic surveillance is a patient with
fever of 5 or more days duration and the presence of at least 4 of the
5 clinical signs, rash, cervical lymphadenopathy (at least 1.5 cm [0.5
in] in diameter), bilateral conjunctival redness, oral mucosal
changes, and peripheral extremity changes (especially swelling of
hands and face. During the convalescence, desquamation of the skin
particularly in the diaper area, palms, and soles. The most dreaded
cardiac development are giant coronary artery aneurysms, which may
rupture or thrombose. More detailed information on Kawasaki disease
from the CDC is available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/kawasaki/>. - Mod.YMA]

[The etiology of Kawasaki disease remains unknown, although many have
suspected an infectious etiology. Indicators suggesting this etiology
include the occurrence of periodic epidemics with geographic spread;
the self-limited nature; the winter and summer presentations; and the
characteristic fever, adenopathy, and eye signs.

Some now believe that many factors (viruses, staphylococci "super
antigens") are capable of triggering a final common pathway that
results in immune activation. All effective therapies are directed at
this immune activity (1). These therapies include intravenous
gamma-globulin (IVIG) and if this does not produce a response, a
course of corticosteroids. Steroids were initially thought to be
detrimental but more recently appear to have a positive effect in IVIG
failures (2). The initial recognition and higher frequency of Kawasaki
disease in Asian populations has led several authors to suggest a
genetic predisposition to genetic polymorphisms (3,4).

state the impressive immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine
activation noted in the acute stage of Kawasaki disease could also be
consistent with superantigenic stimulation. This proposed mechanism
for Kawasaki disease is similar to the mechanism proposed for Toxic
Shock Syndrome. It has also been suggested that Kawasaki disease could
be autoimmune related. If the body is attacking itself, in an
autoimmune type of reaction, then a bacterial superantigen toxin
theory may carry some weight. However, the above referenced article
also indicates that this theory is not entirely water-tight, as not
all studies can confirm it. While the automimmue reaction and the
superantigen toxin theory both continue to be investigated, the
specific cause and the initiating factor for karwasaki disease remain
elusive. - Mod.TG]
