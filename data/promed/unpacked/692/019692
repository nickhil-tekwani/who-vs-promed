Poodle in pet therapy program found to have epidemic strain of
_Clostridium difficile_
-----------------------------------------------
A poodle involved in a hospital visitation program in south-central
Ontario was discovered to be carrying the _Clostridium difficile_
bacterial strain that has caused severe epidemics of the disease in
Quebec, parts of the United States and Britain, a team of Canadian
researchers reports.
While the researchers are unclear how the dog became infected and
whether it passed the bacteria to patients in the unnamed hospitals
and nursing homes it visited, they said the finding suggests
institutions should consider tighter rules for their pet therapy
programs.
"You have to be careful with therapy dogs because they may not be
these nice little bundles of love that are going around," said lead
author Dr. Sandra Lefebvre, a veterinarian and researcher at the
Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph, Ontario.
"They may be carrying something, and you just need to be more
cautious than people are being right now."
The team disclosed their finding in a letter that will be published
in the June 2006 issue of the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Lefebvre discovered the dog was carrying the epidemic strain of
_Clostridium difficile_ during a study in which she screened hospital
therapy dogs for a variety of human disease agents to see whether
they were picking up or spreading bugs in the facilities they
visited. The dogs were tested for pathogens like
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ and _C. difficile_.
The toy poodle, which visited hospitals and long-term care facilities
on a weekly basis, was not evidently ill. But it was shedding _C.
difficile_ bacteria.
Testing revealed the bacteria matched the so called epidemic strain
that has triggered large outbreaks of severe and recurrent _C.
difficile_-associated disease in parts of the U.S., Britain and
Canada. This strain, which produces high levels of toxins, is
associated with a high death rate.
Lefebvre, who specializes in companion animal-related zoonoses
(animal diseases that can pass to humans), would not identify the
facilities the dog visits.
There is no firm proof the dog infected any patients, said Lefebvre,
who said the facilities involved were reluctant to share information
with her.
"The most I could get out of them was that you know, they did have an
increase in cases around the time that the dog was tested, so we
could kind of make that link. But I have no idea whether the dog was
the Typhoid Mary or not."
Experts said it was too soon to say whether therapy animals were
spreading _C. difficile_ or were victims that were being put at risk
because of their exposure to sick humans.
"It is of interest, and I think it's something we've got to keep on
the radar screen," said Dr. Clifford McDonald, a physician scientist
at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control who is a leading researcher
on _C. difficile_.
"I don't think we have to stop all pet therapy."
However, therapy animal programs could use tighter controls to ensure
that both patients and health-care workers understand that dogs and
cats can pick up and potentially spread disease agents in their
travels, the authors said.
"There are some proven benefits to these programs," said Dr. Scott
Weese, senior author on the paper. "But it looks like there are risks
too. It's like anything in life, there's a cost-benefit to it. And
it's a matter of managing programs to decrease that cost and maximize
the benefit."
For a related study, Lefebvre has been following therapy animals on
their visits to hospitals. On several occasions she's seen animal
handlers being urged to bring the pets to visit patients who are in
isolation because they have some contagious bug, like MRSA or _C.
difficile_.
Rooms that are off-limits to human visitors probably ought to be
off-limits to 4-legged ones too, the CDC's McDonald suggested.
Lefebvre also thinks health-care workers and patients should be urged
to clean their hands before and after touching therapy animals.
"There's a little more intimacy between the dogs and the patients in
some circumstances. So if they are carrying something, then probably
the chance is a little higher that they would contact it," she said.

[An excellent review of this organism can be found in ProMED-mail
post 20051202.3472.
_Clostridium difficile_, a gram positive anaerobic bacteria, may be
part of a normal intestinal flora. _C. difficile_ is a major cause of
pseudomembranous colitis and antibiotic associated diarrhea. When the
normal intestinal flora is altered by antibiotics or other disease
processes, the _C. difficile_ flourishes and produces 2 toxins, toxin
A and toxin B, causing a foul-smelling, watery diarrhea.
Toxin A is an enterotoxin, while Toxin B is a cytotoxin.
Demonstration of the toxin in fecal sample is usually required for
definitive diagnosis. This spore forming bacteria can be spread
between patients and through environmental contamination. Frequent
hand washing decreases the spread of this bacteria.
Dogs normally carry this bacteria in their intestine, much the same
as human beings. Likewise, it may express itself when faced with
similar stresses to the normal gut flora. In one study, as many as 50
percent of the dogs carried the bacteria. However, not all the dogs
possessed the toxic strains, and dogs possessing the bacteria were
not all shedding the organism.
The animal in this article appears to have been shedding the
organism, which may serve as notice that hand washing and personal
hygiene are necessary for both the patient being visited and for the
handler. - Mod.TG]
[What is new about this posting is the recognition of the toxinotype
III, ribotype 027 strain of _C. difficile_ in a dog. Finding _C.
difficile_ in the stools of animals has been described by Lefebvre's
Guelph group and others before.
In 2005, Arroyo, et al (1) cite prevalence rates of _C. difficile_ in
the stools of dogs and cats at 6 to 40 percent, and in horses, the
carriage rate was 2 to 29 percent. Arroyo's study reported on 92
strains of the organism isolated from canine stool, 21 from equines
and 20 from humans. They found that 69 percent of canine isolates
were toxin producers, and some strains were indistinguishable between
the species.
In a more recent report screening visitation dogs for potential human
pathogens, Lefebvre (2) found _C. difficile_ in 58 of 102 dogs, and
41 of these (71 percent) were toxigenic.
Whether _C. difficile_, however, can be a zoonotic infection is not
clear. Humans may function as a reservoir for dogs; dogs may function
as a reservoir for humans, or both may be acquiring the potential
pathogen from other animate or inanimate sources.
