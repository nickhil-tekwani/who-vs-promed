No fewer than 54 children have been reported dead after a strange illness
hit the Kazaire Local Government Area of Jigawa State. Several others are
now critically ill in the General Hospital in the area.
The strange illness, which begins with severe fever, attacks children
between the ages of 2 and 5years. Investigation revealed that victims first
develop rashes and in no time die.
According to the father of one of the victims, a few hours after his son
was affected, he developed high fever and died before he could receive
medical attention. He said that 10 children were currently ill and had been
taken to local herbalists, as the illness has defied modern medicine.
Though local health authorities have began a probe into the outbreak,
parents now live in fear, as the illness has affected several communities.

[Jigawa State is one of 36 States that constitute the Federal Republic of
Nigeria. It is situated in the northwestern part of the country. To the
north, Jigawa shares an international border with the Republic of Niger,
which presents the opportunity for cross-border trade.
The current report offers limited symptomatic information, such as severe
fever and rashes followed by death in a short time. By all means, further
information is definitely needed at this stage. - Mod.RY]
