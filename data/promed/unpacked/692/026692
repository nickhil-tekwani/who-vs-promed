Re: Undiagnosed respiratory disease - Indonesia (Papua): RFI 20080326.1129
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of the profound remoteness of the Pegunungan Bintang ("Star
Mountains") regency, an area predominately located in the highlands
of Papua Province (formerly Irian Jaya), Indonesia and aside the
eastern territorial border with Western Province, Papua New Guinea
(PNG), fragmented and unclear reporting of alleged respiratory or
diarrheal outbreaks with associated deaths are not that uncommon.

What is unusual is that reports actually make press in the national
media. More often, such incidents are known only among Papua
residents and local missionaries. Unfortunately, due to the nature of
these affected small and isolated villages, getting medical teams
into these mountainous areas in a meaningful and timely way presents
a great challenge. There are no passable vehicular roads in the
entire regency and the only mode of transport is either by foot or
the occasional small plane or helicopter.

Both acute and chronic respiratory aliments remain major health
concerns in the highlands. As correctly mentioned, the typical
lifestyle of highland people involves living in small, smoke-filled
structures (called a "bokam" among the Star Mt. 'Ok' linguistic
group) during day and night that likely contributes to increased risk
of communicable respiratory-borne infections and chronic disease from
exposure to open fire-related smoke irritants. Moreover, the marginal
living conditions that often include universal lack of sanitation,
questionable water quality, chronic nutritional deficiencies, and
little to no access to primary health all add up to an increased risk
for disease and poor outcome among these susceptible populations.

Although an etiologic agent leading to a severe respiratory outbreak
is certainly conceivable (even H5N1), for many decades, the
experiences in Africa and New Guinea have also implicated severe
malaria as a cause of excess deaths in highland areas normally free
(or of very low prevalence) for the infection (1-4). Severe
_Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria can also present with
pulmonary-related complications (such as, pulmonary edema in adults),
and together with fever, can be suggestive of pneumonia or flu-like
illnesses. Often overlooked, is the movement of highland people from
malaria transmission-free zones to lower-lying malaria endemic areas
in search of food, materials, or to tend subsistence gardens near
more permanent water sources.

Although the potential for unstable (low) transmission generally
exists at elevations of 1200-1600 m (3950-5250 ft), there remains a
significant risk for sporadic epidemics. Even at elevations exceeding
1600 m altitude, 'imported' malaria should be considered as a
potential cause or cofounder regards reported disease outbreaks that
might appear otherwise.

As commented [Mod.CP] more specific demographic and epidemiological
information is sorely needed to try to piece together what has
occurred. It would be of interest to know if similar reports have
been recently recorded in neighboring PNG.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Michael J Bangs for his informed comment from
the region. Malaria is certainly a factor that should be considered.
In fact ProMED-mail reported in 2004 deaths in the Southern Highlands
of adjacent Papua New Guinea that proved to be a consequence of
malaria infection (see references below). On that occasion
ProMED-mail Mod.EP provided the following comment:

"ProMED-mail reported an outbreak of a fatal disease in the Southern
Highlands of Papua New Guinea around 1 Aug 2004, and the Papua New
Guinea authorities have now resolved the outbreak and determined it
was due to malaria. Malaria remains a serious health problem in
coastal and inland regions, affecting 15 provinces. It is endemic up
to an altitude of 1200-1500 metres, where it becomes epidemic.
Transmission is persistently high throughout the year, with
_Plasmodium falciparum_ causing an estimated 75 per cent of
infections. Malaria is the 3rd leading cause of hospital admissions
and deaths. Among the contributing factors are shortages in health
care personnel, breakdowns in drug supplies to rural areas, and lack
of vector control. Only the higher mountainous areas and Port Moresby
are malaria-free. Chloroquine resistance is regarded as widespread,
and chloroquine should not be used for either treatment or
prophylaxis. The overall risk of malaria in PNG was 1.7 per 1000
population in 2000 and 14.3 per 1000 in 2002 (WHO). The apparent
increase may be due to enhanced reporting and not a true rise in incidence."
