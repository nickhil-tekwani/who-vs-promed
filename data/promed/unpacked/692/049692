[Over the past 6 weeks, there has been a decline in incidence that one hopes will continue. Perhaps there has been a decrease in the populations of the Lassa fever virus reservoir host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys_ spp), with a decrease in numbers of virus carriers. This could result in less contamination of the environment with virus-containing excreta from these rodents.

Prevention and control of Lassa fever in nature depends on control of the rodent reservoir, which occurs across Nigeria and beyond. Reduction of populations of this rodent will require active participation at the village level. That will necessitate mounting a public education program with support of rodent control technicians. Preventing entry of rodents into the home and keeping food materials tightly covered are helpful measures to prevent infection.

Lassa virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and can cause acute hemorrhagic fever in humans.
