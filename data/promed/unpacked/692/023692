The Guangdong Provincial Health Commission reported on the evening of 19 Aug 2021, one case of H5N6 was in Huizhou City. The patient is a 52-year-old female who currently lives in Boluo County, Huizhou City. The patient is currently being actively treated in designated hospital in Huizhou.

Experts believe that this is an occasional case and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at this stage. Experts remind that citizens should continue to be vigilant and take the following measures to prevent H5N6 and other avian influenza:
- wash hands frequently: wash hands after touching poultry, before meals and after going to the toilet;
- cook poultry and eggs before eating;
- seek medical attention early: if you have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, and general malaise, you should go to the nearest medical and health institution as soon as possible. If you have been in contact with poultry before, you should take the initiative to tell your doctor;
- do not eat dead poultry meat, do not buy poultry or bird products of unknown origin, and avoid going to live poultry markets as much as possible.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Hong Kong Department of Health reported an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in China. This is the 2nd case reported from the mainland in 2 days.

The case is a 52-year-old woman living in Huizhou, Guangdong Province. From 2014 to date, 40 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by mainland health authorities and 16 of the cases have been reported since December 2020.

Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.

Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illnesses have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[According to the 8 Aug 2021 WHO summary and assessment, from 23 Jun 2021 to 8 Aug 2021, 6 cases of influenza A(H5N6) virus infection were reported to WHO from China. Since 2014, mainland health authorities have notified a total of 37 human cases of avian influenza A (H5N6). There have been recent reports of additional cases from Sichuan Province, China in March, June, and July 2021, as well as in Laos in April 2021.

"All 6 recent cases were sporadic infections due to exposure to live poultry or live poultry markets. No suspected cases were detected among close contacts of these cases at the time of reporting. The 61-year-old woman who had mild illness was detected through influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance." (https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/human-animal-interface-risk-assessments/influenza_summary_ira_ha_interface_08_08_2021.pdf)

Whenever avian influenza viruses are circulating in poultry, there is a risk for sporadic infection and small clusters of human cases due to exposure to infected poultry or contaminated environments. Therefore, sporadic human cases are not unexpected. Intensive surveillance should be continued to detect cases and early changes in transmissibility and infectivity of these viruses, as the frequency of cases is increasing.

According to reports received by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), various influenza A(H5) subtypes continue to be detected in birds in Africa, Europe, and Asia. - Mod.UBA
