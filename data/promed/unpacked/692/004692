Birds on [a free-range egg] farm near Lethbridge [Victoria] have tested positive for H7N7 avian influenza virus. Fowl found to have contracted the virus are being euthanized to stop the spread of the disease. [The farm had 43 000 birds and 21 750 cases of avian influenza, according to the immediate notification of the event to OIE; see https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=35259. - Mod.TG]

H7N7 is spread from one sick bird to another and mainly affects chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, guinea fowl, quail, pheasants, ostriches, and wild birds. It can also be passed from animal-to-person and person-to-person if there is direct contact.

Symptoms start off like the common flu such as cough, fever, sore throat, muscle aches, headache, and shortness of breath.

Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Dr Graeme Cooke said a 5km [3.1 mi] radius protection zone had been placed around the farm and it is in quarantine. Workers and bio-security officers are managing the situation, he added.

'These controls prohibit the movement of birds, related equipment, and products within and out of the designated control area of Golden Plains Shire unless a permit for movement has been granted by Agriculture Victoria until further notice,' he told Geelong Advertiser.

'Agriculture Victoria is conducting surveillance throughout the restricted area buffer zone to determine whether the virus is contained to the property or whether it may be active in other areas.'

There is currently no risk to any food supplied by the farm.

Farmers are being urged to report any suspicious and unexplained bird deaths to the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline, or to their local vet or to Agriculture Victoria animal health staff.

There is currently no risk to any food supplied by the farm.

[This has already been confirmed as a highly pathogenic (high path) avian influenza (see the reference to the OIE report above).

Biosecurity is not a catch-phrase, it is a serious term used to mean disinfect everything possibly having come into contact with infected material. This includes vehicles, vehicle tires, boots, coveralls, the outside of feed sacks, hands, etc.

An outbreak of avian influenza has been confirmed in Victoria. Poultry owners are reminded to have good biosecurity measures in place at all times to reduce the risk of diseases being introduced or spread.

If you suspect avian influenza in birds within Queensland, immediately contact 13 25 23 (business hours) or the Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888 (after hours).

Between 1976 and 1997, 7 outbreaks of HPAI occurred in Australia. HPAI viruses caused clinical disease in commercial poultry in Victoria in 1976 (H7N7), 1985 (H7N7) and 1992 (H7N3), in Queensland in 1994 (H7N3), and in New South Wales in 1997 (H7N4), 2012 (H7N7), and 2013 (H7N2). Each time, there was severe disease in affected chicken flocks. All had obvious or circumstantial evidence of contact with wild waterfowl or surface water contaminated by wild waterfowl, or with free-range farmed ducks. There is some evidence that, initially, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) may have been involved in the outbreaks in 1976, 1992 and 1997 (Selleck et al 2003)

The information below was extracted from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment page on avian influenza, available at https://www.agriculture.gov.au/pests-diseases-weeds/animal/avian-influenza#what-is-australia-doing-about-avian-influenza (last updated 4 Nov 2019).

"Australia is well prepared to deal with a case of avian influenza should it occur in poultry here. There have been 7 minor incidents of highly pathogenic avian influenza (all involving types of avian influenza that have not caused disease in humans) in Australia, the last being in 2013. Each was eradicated before the disease was able to significantly spread. Workers involved with diseased poultry did not become infected with avian influenza in any of these outbreaks. Australia has a surveillance program to detect incursions of avian influenza.

"Animal health authorities have had contingency plans in place for many years to minimize the impact of an outbreak of avian influenza in Australia. These procedures are outlined in the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN; https://www.animalhealthaustralia.com.au/our-publications/ausvetplan-manuals-and-documents/). AUSVETPLAN describes the response measures that will be used should an outbreak occur, including the culling of infected birds, disposal method used for carcasses, and sanitary measures that will be adopted at infection sites to contain the disease."
