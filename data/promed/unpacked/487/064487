The vanishing variants: lessons from gamma, iota and mu
-------------------------------------------------------
Studying the coronavirus variants that have faded away could help us prepare for what comes next, scientists say.

In early 2021, scientists in Colombia discovered a worrisome new coronavirus variant. This variant, eventually known as mu, had several troubling mutations that experts believed could help it evade the immune system's defenses.

Over the following months, mu spread swiftly in Colombia, fueling a new surge of COVID-19 cases. By the end of August [2021], it had been detected in dozens of countries, and the World Health Organization had designated it a "variant of interest."

"Mu was starting to make some noise globally," said Joseph Fauver, a genomic epidemiologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and an author of a recent study on the variant.

And then it fizzled. Today, the variant has all but vanished.

For every delta or omicron there is a gamma, iota or mu, variants that drove local surges but never swept to global dominance. And while understanding omicron remains a critical public health priority, there are lessons to be learned from these lesser lineages, experts say.

"This virus has no incentive to stop adapting and evolving," said Joel Wertheim, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of California San Diego. "And seeing how it did that in the past will help us prepare for what it might do in the future."

Studies of the also-rans have shed light on surveillance gaps and policy blunders -- providing more evidence that America's international travel bans were not effective -- and on what makes the virus successful, suggesting that in the early phase of the pandemic, transmissibility was more important than immune evasion.

The research also highlights how much context matters; variants that make an impact in some places never gain a foothold in others. As a result, predicting which variants will surge to dominance is difficult, and staying on top of future variants and pathogens will require comprehensive, nearly real-time surveillance.

"We can gain a lot by looking at the viral genomic sequence and saying, 'This one is probably worse than another one,'" Dr. Wertheim said. "But the only way to really know is to watch it spread, because there are a whole lot of potentially dangerous variants that never took hold."

Here's looking at mu
--------------------
The coronavirus is constantly changing, and most new variants never get noticed or named. But others raise alarms, either because they quickly become more common or because their genomes look ominous.

Both were true of mu as it spread in Colombia. "It contained a couple of mutations that people had been watching very closely," said Mary Petrone, a genomic epidemiologist at the University of Sydney and an author of the new mu paper. Several of the mutations in its spike protein had been documented in other immune-evasive variants, including beta and gamma.

In the new study, which has not yet been published in a scientific journal, scientists compared mu's biological characteristics to those of alpha, beta, delta, gamma and the original virus. Mu did not replicate faster than any other variant, they found, but it was the most immune-evasive of the bunch -- more resistant to antibodies than any known variant besides omicron, Dr. Fauver said.

By analyzing the genomic sequences of mu samples collected from all over the world, the researchers reconstructed the variant's spread. They concluded that mu had likely emerged in South America in mid-2020. It then circulated for months before it was detected.

Genomic surveillance in many parts of South America was "patchy and incomplete," said Jesse Bloom, an expert in viral evolution at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. "If there had been better surveillance in those regions, possibly it would have been easier to make a faster assessment of how worried to be about mu."

Mu presented another challenge, too. It happened to have a type of mutation, known as a frameshift mutation, that was rare in coronavirus samples. Such mutations were flagged as errors when scientists, including Dr. Fauver, tried to upload their mu sequences to GISAID, an international repository of viral genomes used to keep tabs on new variants.

That complication created delays in the public sharing of mu sequences. The time that elapsed between when a virus sample was collected from a patient and when it was made publicly available on GISAID was consistently longer for mu cases than for delta cases, the researchers found.

"The genome itself was basically creating artificial surveillance gaps," Dr. Fauver said. "It resulted, at least in our experience, in us not getting data out for weeks when normally we're trying to get it out in days." (GISAID's quality-control systems are important, the researchers stressed, and the repository has fixed the issue.)

Combine these surveillance gaps with mu's immune evasiveness and the variant seemed poised to take off. But that is not what happened. Instead, mu radiated from South and Central America to other continents but did not circulate widely once it got there, the scientists found. "That was an indication that this variant was not as fit necessarily in maybe the North American and European populations as we had expected," Dr. Petrone said.

That was likely because mu found itself competing with an even more formidable variant: delta. Delta was not as skilled at dodging antibodies as mu, but it was more transmissible. "So, in the end, delta spread more widely," Dr. Bloom said.

Studying successful variants tells only half the story. "Variants that do not become dominant are, in a way, negative controls," Dr. Petrone said. "They tell us what didn't work, and, in doing so, help to fill in knowledge gaps around variant fitness."

Delta overtook several immune-evasive variants besides mu, including beta, gamma and lambda. This pattern suggests that immune evasion alone was not enough to allow a variant to outdo a highly transmissible version of the virus -- or at least it wasn't during the early phase of the pandemic, when few people had immunity.

But vaccinations and multiple waves of infection have changed the immune landscape. A highly immune-evasive variant should now have more of an edge, scientists said, which is likely part of the reason omicron has been so successful.

Another recent study suggested that in New York City immune-evasive gamma tended to do better in neighborhoods with higher levels of pre-existing immunity, in some cases because they were hit hard in the 1st COVID wave. "We can't view a new variant in a vacuum, because it comes about in the shadow of all of the variants that came before it," said Dr. Wertheim, who was an author of the study.

Indeed, the clash of variants past reveals that success is highly dependent on context. For example, New York City may have been the birthplace of the iota variant, which was first detected in virus samples collected in November 2020. "And so it got a foothold early on," said Dr. Petrone. Even after the more transmissible alpha variant arrived, iota remained the city's dominant variant for months, before eventually fading away.

But in Connecticut, where iota and alpha both appeared in January 2021, things unfolded differently. "Alpha just kind of took off immediately, and iota didn't stand a chance," said Dr. Petrone, who led a study of the variants in the 2 regions.

A similar pattern is already beginning to play out with omicron's multiple lineages. In the United States, BA.2.12.1, a subvariant first identified in New York, has taken off, while in South Africa, BA.4 and BA.5 are driving a new surge.

That's another reason to study variants that waned, said Sarah Otto, an evolutionary biologist at the University of British Columbia. A variant that was poorly matched for a certain time and place could take off in another. Indeed, mu's misfortune might have simply been that it emerged too soon. "There might not have been enough people that had immunity to really give that variant a boost," Dr. Otto said.

But the next variant of concern could be a descendant of, or something similar to, an immune-evasive lineage that never quite took hold, she said.

Looking back at previous variants can also provide insight into what worked -- or didn't -- in containing them. The new gamma study, provides further evidence that international travel bans, at least as the United States implemented them, are unlikely to prevent a variant's global spread.

Gamma was first identified in Brazil in late 2020. In May of that year [2020], the United States barred most non-U.S. citizens from traveling into the country from Brazil, a restriction that remained in place until November 2021. Yet gamma was detected in the United States in January 2021 and soon spread to dozens of states.

Because gamma never came to dominate worldwide, studying its spread provided a "cleaner" picture of the effectiveness of travel bans, said Tetyana Vasylyeva, a molecular epidemiologist at the University of California San Diego and an author of the study. "When it comes to studying variants like, let's say, delta -- something that has caused a major outbreak in every place -- it is really difficult at times to find patterns, because it happens on a very large scale and very fast," she said.

In an ongoing global health emergency, with a virus that changes fast, there is an understandable impulse to focus on the future, Dr. Fauver said. And as the world's attention turned to delta and then omicron, he and his colleagues discussed whether to continue their study of old-news mu.

"We were like, 'Does anyone care about mu anymore?'" Dr. Fauver recalled. "But we think there's still room for high-quality studies that ask questions about previous variants of concern and try to look back on what happened."

[2] Health inequities

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and vaccines are rolled out, the "double burden" of disparities in exposure and vaccination intersect to determine patterns of infection, immunity, and mortality. Serology provides a unique opportunity to measure prior infection and vaccination simultaneously. Leveraging algorithmically-selected residual sera from 2 hospital networks in the city of San Francisco, cross-sectional samples from 1014 individuals from 4-17 Feb 2021 were each tested on 2 assays (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2), capturing the 1st year of the epidemic and early roll-out of vaccination. We estimated, using Bayesian estimation of infection and vaccination, that infection risk of Hispanic/Latinx residents was 5 times greater than of White residents aged 18-64 (95% Credible Interval (CrI): 3.2-10.3), and that White residents over 65 were twice as likely to be vaccinated as Black/African American residents (95% CrI: 1.1-4.6). We found that socioeconomically-deprived zipcodes had higher infection probabilities and lower vaccination coverage than wealthier zipcodes. While vaccination has created a 'light at the end of the tunnel' for this pandemic, ongoing challenges in achieving and maintaining equity must also be considered.

Discussion
----------
...Since the early days of the pandemic, many policy recommendations have been made for ways to reduce health disparities in infection (29) and vaccination (30). Policymakers must invest in addressing both the upstream, structural drivers of health disparities, such as providing workers with a living wage, affordable housing, and access to quality healthcare, and also downstream drivers such as improved community engagement, targeted testing and vaccination provision, and assistance with common barriers to accessing healthcare such as technology access/literacy, transport, and providing accessible health information in multiple languages. While the arrival of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has created a 'light at the end of the tunnel' for this pandemic, ongoing challenges that long predate COVID-19 in achieving and maintaining equity must also be considered.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Evidence is needed on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in various types of environmental samples and on the estimated transmission risks in non-healthcare settings on campus.

Objectives
The objective of this research was to collect data on SARS-CoV-2 viral load and to examine potential infection risks of people exposed to the virus in publicly accessible non-healthcare environments on a university campus.

Methods
Air and surface samples were collected using wetted wall cyclone bioaerosol samplers and swab kits, respectively, in a longitudinal environmental surveillance program from August 2020 until April 2021 on the University of Michigan Ann Arbor campus. Quantitative rRT-PCR with primers and probes targeting gene N1 were used for SARS-CoV-2 RNA quantification. The RNA concentrations were used to estimate the probability of infection by quantitative microbial risk assessment modeling and Monte-Carlo simulation.

Results
In total, 256 air samples and 517 surface samples were collected during the study period, among which positive rates were 1.6% and 1.4%, respectively. Point-biserial correlation showed that the total case number on campus was significantly higher in weeks with positive environmental samples than in non-positive weeks (p = 0.001). The estimated probability of infection was about 1 per 100 exposures to SARS-CoV-2-laden aerosols through inhalation and as high as 1 per 100 000 exposures from contacting contaminated surfaces in simulated scenarios.

Significance
Viral shedding was demonstrated by the detection of viral RNA in multiple air and surface samples on a university campus. The low overall positivity rate indicated that the risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at monitored locations was low. Risk modeling results suggest that inhalation is the predominant route of exposure compared to surface contact, which emphasizes the importance of protecting individuals from airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and potentially other respiratory infectious diseases.

Impact
Given the reoccurring epidemics caused by highly infectious respiratory viruses in recent years, our manuscript reinforces the importance of monitoring environmental transmission by the simultaneous sampling and integration of multiple environmental surveillance matrices for modeling and risk assessment.

Discussion
...The study results support the use of proactive disease mitigation on campuses during this pandemic. The modeling procedures used herein are also valuable in studies of the respiratory infectious diseases with similar transmission mechanisms in preparation for future outbreaks.

[4] Remdesivir
Date: Wed 4 May 2022

Remdesivir slightly lowers death, ventilation in COVID hospital patients
------------------------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 patients already on ventilators don't benefit from remdesivir, but the antiviral drug offers a slight reduction in death or progression to ventilation among other hospitalized patients, according to final results from the adaptive World Health Organization's (WHO's) Solidarity randomized trial and an updated meta-analysis.

The findings, published this week in The Lancet, were from an ongoing study of 4 repurposed antiviral drugs as treatments for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. [WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium. Remdesivir and 3 other drugs for hospitalised patients with COVID-19: final results of the WHO Solidarity randomised trial and updated meta-analyses. The Lancet. Published: 2 May 2022. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00519-0]

The researchers had previously stopped studying the drugs lopinavir, hydroxychloroquine, and interferon β1a because they showed no benefits. Enrollment in the remdesivir arm, however, continued until donated supplies ran low.

The trial enrolled 14 221 patients from 454 hospitals in 35 countries in 6 WHO regions, including 8275 randomly assigned to receive either up to 10 daily infusions of remdesivir or an open-label control drug from 22 Mar 2020-29 Jan 2021, before the emergence of the delta and omicron variants.

No benefit for patients already on ventilators
----------------------------------------------
A total of 602 of 4146 (14.5%) patients assigned to remdesivir died, compared with 643 of 4129 (15.6%) control patients (mortality rate ratio [RR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 1.02).

Among the 359 patients already on a ventilator, 151 (42.1%) assigned to remdesivir died, compared with 134 of 347 (38.6%) control patients (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.42).

Of patients not on a ventilator but receiving high- or low-flow oxygen, 14.6% of remdesivir recipients and 16.3% of controls died (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.99). Among the 1730 patients who didn't need oxygen at hospital admission, 2.9% of remdesivir participants and 3.8% of controls died (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.28).

When all patients not initially requiring ventilation were combined, 11.9% of remdesivir recipients and 13.5% of controls died (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.98), and 14.1% and 15.7%, respectively, progressed to need ventilation (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.00). The composite outcome of death or progression to ventilation occurred in 19.6% of remdesivir recipients, compared with 22.5% of controls (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75 to- 0.93].

The meta-analysis of all randomized trials of remdesivir versus no remdesivir that had death data available had comparable findings.

The trial and meta-analysis suggest that remdesivir didn't reduce the death rate in already-ventilated patients but conferred a slight benefit to patients receiving oxygen but not ventilation, the authors noted. "However, given that high-flow and low-flow oxygen were not recorded separately at enrollment into Solidarity, it is not known whether any protective effect in non-ventilated patients extends to those on high-flow oxygen," they wrote.

Better COVID treatments still needed
------------------------------------
The findings aren't materially different from those of interim results published in February 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers said. "This additional evidence has, however, reduced the statistical uncertainty in the mortality RRs," they wrote, adding that the final results also produced more solid evidence on progression to ventilation among remdesivir recipients. [WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium. Repurposed Antiviral Drugs for COVID-19 -- Interim WHO Solidarity Trial Results. 11 Feb 2021. N Engl J Med 2021; 384:497-511. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2023184]

But regardless of these findings, better drugs to treat COVID-19 will still be needed, the researchers said. "Oral antiviral agents, various immune modulators, and monoclonal antibodies against currently circulating variants of concern are now emerging that might prove more effective, more convenient, or less expensive than daily remdesivir infusions, but large-scale randomised evidence will be needed to evaluate and compare them," they wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal, Carolina Garcia-Vidal, MD, PhD, of the University of Barcelona in Spain, and Maurizio Sanguinetti, MD, of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A Gemelli IRCCS in Rome, said that the conclusions of the study were limited by not including data on days from illness onset to remdesivir administration, viral loads measured by cycle threshold values, viral antigen levels, and other factors. [Carolina Garcia-Vidal and Maurizio Sanguinetti. When and which patients should receive remdesivir? Lancet. Published: 2 May 2022. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)00789-9]

Also, more recent events in the course of the pandemic, including the emergence of delta and omicron and the wide availability of COVID-19 vaccination, may limit the findings' applicability to today's situation. "Debate about when and which patients should receive remdesivir or co-adjuvant treatments will, therefore, continue," they wrote.

"Still, the research conducted by the WHO Solidarity Trial Consortium adds meaningfully to the evidence base by demonstrating that we now know remdesivir can reduce the risk of death or progression of mechanical ventilation (or both) in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen therapy," Garcia-Vidal and Sanguinetti wrote.

- The Americas region reported 16.2% of cases and 25.8% of deaths during the past 24 hours. It has reported more than 153.34 million cases, 2nd to the European region as the most severely affected region. The USA reported 77 271 cases in the last 24 hours followed by Brazil, Canada, and Chile, all reporting more than 1000 cases. Additionally, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Peru, and Panama reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases in the last 24 hours. Argentina, Mexico, Columbia, Costa Rica and Uruguay, among others, did not report cases over the last 24 hours.

- The European region reported 53.4% of cases and 49.8% of deaths over the last 24 hours. It is the most affected region with cumulative cases exceeding 215.80 million. Some countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Poland, Belgium, Switzerland (5 cases), Sweden and Tajikistan. A total of 14 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours: no country reported more than 100 000 cases, 5 reported more than 10 000, 9 reported over 1000 cases, while 4 countries reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.
