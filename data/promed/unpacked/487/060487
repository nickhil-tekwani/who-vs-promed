A spokesman for the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) said today (5 Jun 2016) that under the routine surveillance programme for avian influenza (AI) at markets and fresh provision shops, which is commissioned by the department and conducted by the University of Hong Kong, a sample of faecal droppings of live poultry taken from a poultry stall in Yan Oi Market in Tuen Mun on 16 May 2016 was tested positive yesterday (4 Jun 2016) for the H7N9 avian influenza virus. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) will declare the live poultry stalls at Yan Oi Market in Tuen Mun as an infected place, which will be closed for thorough disinfection and cleansing.

The spokesman said: "There are 2 poultry stalls in Yan Oi Market, and there is no sample from the other stall tested positive for the H7N9 virus. The affected stall sells live poultry, including live chickens and pigeons. The FEHD, upon receiving the test result, has immediately conducted thorough cleansing and disinfection at the 2 stalls and is tracing the source of the poultry."

In accordance with the contingency plan for detection of AI virus in Hong Kong, trading of live poultry will be suspended pending follow-up investigations to trace the source of the virus.

Supply of chickens from local farms has been suspended. The AFCD will conduct inspection on all local chicken farms and collect samples for AI testing in order to ascertain that none of the local farms or chickens have been infected with AI. Import of live poultry will also be suspended.

The AFCD will continue with the surveillance and monitoring of local chicken farms. It has requested all poultry farmers to immediately report any abnormalities and adhere strictly to the biosecurity measures at the farms. The AFCD will notify the World Organisation for Animal Health of the incident.

For AI prevention, the FEHD has implemented a number of measures at public market stalls selling live poultry, including enhanced inspections and ensuring strict compliance with the requirement of "no overnight stocking," that is, live poultry stall operators must slaughter all live poultry in the stalls before 8pm every evening, and no live poultry can be kept on the premises between 8pm and 5am the following day. In addition, all public areas at the markets are cleansed 3 times a day by the market cleaning contractors.

Live poultry stall operators are also required to clean their stalls after the close of business every day, after which the market cleaning contractors will clean and disinfect the stalls once again.

The spokesman pointed out that the FEHD has commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct routine AI surveillance at markets and fresh provision shops. Each month, a total of 300 faecal and drinking samples are taken from 30 venues, including 25 live poultry stalls at FEHD markets and 5 licensed fresh provision shops with endorsement to sell live poultry, for AI testing, with the aim to reduce the possibilities of the spread of AI virus in Hong Kong.

The spokesman said the government will remain vigilant and implement diligently a series of risk management measures to safeguard public health and hygiene.

[The detection of the virus in droppings of apparently non-clinically-affected poultry may be indicative of the low pathogenicity of the virus strain, in line with previous reports on H7N9 in Eastern China.

On Fri 3 Jun 2016, just 2 days prior to the publication of the above information, Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (in the Department of Health) published the following relevant press release:

"CHP closely monitors additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Beijing: The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (3 Jun 2016) closely monitoring an additional human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Beijing and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel."

According to the Beijing Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning, the case is a male patient aged 49 from Tongzhou.

From 2013 to date, 760 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, while since October 2015 to date, 103 cases have been recorded.

"We will remain vigilant and work closely with the World Health Organization and relevant health authorities to monitor the latest developments," a spokesman for the DH said.

"The DH's Port Health Office conducts health surveillance measures at all boundary control points. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up.

The display of posters and broadcast of health messages in departure and arrival halls as health education for travellers is underway. The travel industry and other stakeholders are regularly updated on the latest information.

Travellers, especially those returning from avian influenza-affected areas with fever or respiratory symptoms, should immediately wear masks, seek medical attention, and reveal their travel history to doctors. Health-care professionals should pay special attention to patients who might have had contact with poultry, birds or their droppings in affected areas.

The public should remain vigilant and take heed of the advice against avian influenza below:

- Do not visit live poultry markets and farms. Avoid contact with poultry, birds and their droppings;
- If contact has been made, thoroughly wash hands with soap;
- Avoid entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered and contact with surfaces which might be contaminated by droppings of poultry or other animals;
- Poultry and eggs should be thoroughly cooked before eating;
- Wash hands frequently with soap, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, handling food or eating; after going to the toilet or touching public installations or equipment (including escalator handrails, elevator control panels and door knobs); and when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing;
- Cover the nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing, hold the spit with a tissue and put it into a covered dustbin;
- Avoid crowded places and contact with fever patients; and
- Wear masks when respiratory symptoms develop or when taking care of fever patients."

The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain responsible for human infections in China has been reported from Eastern China since March 2013, circulating mostly in live poultry markets. This virus strain is of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9), which means the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent, i.e., subclinical. The birds are, in fact, the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied to apparently healthy animals, or -- as seen multiple times -- following human infection, humans playing the unfortunate role of virus sentinels.

The occurrence of H7N9 in humans in China has a seasonal pattern, peaking in winter months. Reportedly, the case fatality rate in humans is above 25 percent.

China's final report (No 18) to the OIE on H7N9 was submitted on 31 Aug 2015, when the outbreak was declared "resolved," with no additional reports to be submitted.

OIE's Q&A on LPAI H7N9 is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-influenza-ah7n9/.

The absence of secondary A(H7N9) cases in humans implied that the human-to-human transmission potential of the circulating virus remains low. - Mod.AS
