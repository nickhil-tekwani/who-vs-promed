West Australians have been warned to thoroughly wash pawpaw following
several cases of foodborne illness, including one in which a person
required hospital treatment.

The WA Department of Health issued a statement on Tuesday [15 Sep
2009] saying 7 cases of salmonellosis linked to the tropical fruit had
been uncovered over the past 6 weeks.

WA environmental health director Jim Dodds said people should consult
their doctor if they had eaten pawpaw and were suffering symptoms like
diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, or fever and headaches.
Mr Dodds said the department had launched an investigation into the
poisoning.

"Wash all pawpaws with running tap water immediately before eating,
this includes pawpaw that has been cut prior to purchasing," Mr Dodds
said. "After cutting pawpaw at home thoroughly wash hands, cutting
boards, and knives."

[The serotype of the pathogen here is not stated. A similar outbreak
in Western Australia in 2006 was caused by _S._ Litchfield.

In the article above, pawpaw refers to the tropical fruit papaya
(_Carica papaya_). The contamination is likely to have resulted from
cutting a fruit contaminated with salmonella organisms on its external
skin, as has occurred with melons.

Of additional side interest, in the USA, Pawpaw (_Asimina_) also known
as a prairie banana, Kentucky banana, or Ozark banana, is a genus of 8
or 9 species of small trees with large leaves and fruit, and is native
to southeastern North America. The genus includes the largest edible
fruit native to North America. However, this fruit has no relation to
the pawpaw described in the article above, associated with the
salmonella outbreak.
