Health officials are concerned about the spread of measles, warning that the Ministry of Health cannot stop it. The center of the epidemic is in the Jerusalem area, where 341 cases of measles have been detected since the beginning of the year [2018] -- more than half of the cases diagnosed countrywide. Last month [September 2018] the number of newly diagnosed measles cases reached 213. The number of new cases of measles in Israel in 2018 is 20-fold higher than in 2017.

A senior epidemiologist says, "15 new cases of measles are recorded every day in hospitals in Jerusalem. The medical teams do Sisyphean work and try to locate anyone who comes into contact with the patient; this is not fully achievable." According to the senior physician, if the Ministry of Health does not launch a nationwide publicity campaign that calls on the public to be vaccinated, it will spread to other areas.

In August 2018, the Health Ministry expressed concern about the outbreak of measles in the Jerusalem district [see references below], and the district physician, Dr Chen Stein Zamir, pointed out the low rates of vaccination and the increase in the number of people infected with the disease. In the past few weeks, there has been a further increase in the number of cases in Jerusalem.

"The outbreak is severe and we see it both in community clinics and in hospitals," said Yechiel Schlesinger, director of the Wilf Children's Hospital at Shaare Zedek Medical Center, who specializes in infectious diseases. "The problem in Jerusalem is in areas and populations, such as some ultra-Orthodox [Jewish] neighborhoods, where there are pockets of non-immunization, and not everyone is careful to be vaccinated." He said the children who arrive at the hospital are either infants under the age of one year who have not yet received the 1st dose and are therefore not protected from the disease, or older children who have not been vaccinated at all or have not received the 2nd dose. "At this stage we do not have patients in intensive care but there are children with severe pneumonia, and a pregnant woman who got infected and we have to treat her newborn with antibodies immediately after birth," says Schlesinger.

According to him, a large share of the resources of the medical teams is invested in isolating the patients and in locating everyone who had been in contact with them. "We try to make sure that every suspect case gets to the hospital, avoiding entering the central, main spaces of the building. We have even created a bypass route directly to the isolation ward, but this is a goal that cannot be 100 percent achieved". The dynamics of such epidemics are that they start from "pockets" from where they spread/leak. He believes that the low vaccination rate in some neighborhoods in Jerusalem does not necessarily stem from choice, but from lack of awareness.

The attempt to isolate patients in order to prevent infecting others has also been difficult. "We are trying to track the exposure and to check who has measles," says Prof Alon Mozes, director of the Department of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital. "But in Jerusalem we are close to losing control because there is a large population that is not vaccinated. We need to issue a call from the Ministry of Health and the heads of the ultra-Orthodox community urging to vaccinate."

According to Mozes, the diagnosed cases account for only one tenth of those who have not yet been diagnosed. "It is one of the most contagious diseases, many times more than the flu, which has a spread range of several meters. Measles infective particles are light and airborne and remain in the room's air space even 2 hours after the disease-carrier left the room. I am convinced that the number of cases is 10 times higher than the number of cases diagnosed, and is steadily growing", he says.

According to Dr Eli Schwartz, director of the Sheba-Tel Hashomer Center for Travel Medicine and Tropical Diseases, there are also vaccinants in Israel who are not protected against the disease. "There is a large segment of the population, born during the period of 1957-1977, who were immunized at a time when it was believed that one vaccination is sufficient, so their immunity is now partial." Schwartz adds that "the Ministry of Health primarily warns travelers to Europe and endemic countries, and it should simultaneously focus on populations that are not immune and call on them to be vaccinated."

The Health Ministry is considering lowering the age of initial measles vaccination in toddlers from 1 year to 9 months of age. The report noted that since the beginning of the year [2018], 666 cases of measles [in all of Israel] have been reported to the Ministry of Health. This is a meteoric leap, and the fear is that the number will rise. The subject will be is on the agenda of a meeting this week. It should be noted that the vaccine is usually given at the age of 1 year.

Only 4 days ago, the Health Ministry in Jerusalem reported that a measles patient was on Israir flight 6H474, which left Eilat for the S'de Dov airport (Tel-Aviv] on 9 Oct 2018 at 13:55. The flight attendants said that if anyone on that flight were to develop fever and/or rash, they should inform their family doctor about having had contact with a measles patient.

In addition, passengers belonging to risk groups, including infants under the age of 12 months, pregnant women, people with immunodeficiency disorders (such as cancer patients during chemotherapy, patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids, or AIDS patients) are kindly requested to call by telephone as soon as possible to discuss the possible need for their vaccination.

A similar case was reported last month [September 2018] when the Ministry of Health announced that a passenger suspected of having measles had traveled on a number of flights from Israel to Kiev. Travelers with severe illnesses, pregnant women, and infants were then asked to be examined.

Georgia ranks 3rd among the top 7 European countries where the number of cases of measles has increased the most, show data from the World Health Organization. Since the beginning of this year [2018], 1400 cases have been reported, 2 of which have been fatal.

The 1st case of measles was reported in January 2018, when a hospital worker in Guria, Western Georgia, fell ill. The illness later appeared in Adjara and spread throughout most of Western Georgia.

Specialists predict that the number of people infected will increase. Those that have not had measles in the past and who are not vaccinated against the disease are most at risk. The National Centre for Disease Control reports that there are about half a million people at risk in Georgia.

"Research shows that these are people between 20 and 40 years old. As the number of people who are not vaccinated against measles remains high, the disease will spread," says Paata Imnadze, the centre's deputy director.

Breakouts of measles in Georgia took place back in 2004 and 2005 as well when 14 500 fell ill and 9 died. In 2014 and 2015, 4 people died from measles.

Vaccinations against measles were first introduced in Georgia in 1968. Before that, the disease was popularly known as batonebi [ed. the Georgian word for 'sirs, masters'] and was treated with folk medicine.

"Batonebi" and anti-vaxxers
---------------------------
A 58-year-old woman remembers well how she and her sister fell sick with measles: their grandmother hung red velvet curtains on the windows, put red roses in vases and strongly warned the residents of the home not to curse or argue. The children had to sing in order not to anger the batonebi, or masters. The illness took its toll on them -- [the woman's hearing suffered, while her sister had trouble with her hearing and vision.

"We gave both our children scheduled vaccinations. Considering my own experience, I didn't want to risk their health," says the woman. However, in Georgia there are many people that think differently and do not vaccinate their children. Official data has it that 10 per cent of children up to 6 years of age are not vaccinated in Georgia.

IA is a young mother who has ensured that her 3-year-old child receives all the necessary vaccinations. IA searches for the best doctors and reads up on information pertaining to vaccinations herself.

"I didn't find any reliable information anywhere that supported the idea that vaccinations can give rise to serious complications or illnesses," she said.

NT is 25 years old. She is the co-founder of the NGO Vaccinations and Risk Factors, which collects and distributes information about the dangers of vaccines. NT asserts that there are many side effects to vaccines which she herself has experienced: "I began having epileptic attacks when I was 5 years old, and they continued until I was 18. I was afraid to go outside because I did not know when I would have an attack. The doctors didn't understand what was the matter with me. Then we realised that it all began with a scheduled vaccination."

NT's daughter is 3 years old, and aside from vaccinations against tuberculosis (BCG) and hepatitis B, she has not received any scheduled vaccinations. NT says she gets her information about the dangers of vaccinations from the internet and that she herself studies the cases she has come across.

"There was one case where a child received a vaccination and later became autistic. Another child lost an arm after getting polio from a vaccination," she says.

NT says that, despite the fact that she hasn't been vaccinated, her daughter is not ill and has a good immune system. Because of this she does not intend to begin vaccinating her in the future either.

The Centre for Disease Control denies all claims that vaccinations can cause illness or complications, and attests to the quality of available vaccines.

"We only get high-quality European vaccines in Georgia. After the 1990s, there has not been a single case of complications or infections after vaccination," says Imnadze.

Imnadze says there are practically no complications associated with the measles vaccine. "The worst thing that can happen is an allergic reaction, but we have not had such a case to date." Imnadze says that such cases are very rare, one in a million, and even in these cases a doctor can always act quickly and provide urgent care.

Is disinformation to blame?
---------------------------
Specialists say there are 2 reasons behind the epidemic in Georgia: the failure of the 1990s immunisation programme and the subsequent refusal of parents to vaccinate their children afterwards.

In 2008 the government planned to have one million people between the ages of 6 and 27 vaccinated. However, only about half of their target was reached.

"A media campaign began which attested to the supposed harms of vaccination -- even I became afraid. The programme, of course, failed," says Imnadze.

There are several myths in Georgian society pertaining to the use of vaccinations. Many continue to think that vaccinations can cause autism.

The greatest harm to regular vaccinations in the world was caused by an article by English scientist Andrew Wakefield in the Lancet journal in 1998 in which he claimed that a measles vaccine was causing autism.

It was later proven that the article was paid for and falsified. The journal issued an apology and had the article retracted. However, the lie spread like a virus: the consequences of that article in Europe and the USA have more or less been overcome, but in Georgia it has been difficult. [The damage done by the retracted article still lingers in both Europe and the USA as evidenced by the multiple large outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease we continue to see in both areas. - Mod.JH]

"The Russian propaganda machine took an interest in the topic of vaccination against measles. It has been shown that Russian trolls have been involved in the dissemination of disinformation across European social media and internet sites," Imnadze says.

The Georgian parliament is looking at a bill which will make vaccinations mandatory. Should parents be unable to show a document attesting to their child's vaccination history, children will not be accepted into schools. The bill was accepted in its first reading.

However, the NGO Vaccinations and Risk Factors is gathering signatures to prevent this bill from coming into force. Activists of the movement say they will come out in protest.

"When a child falls ill before 1 year of age, this means that the mother did not have immunity against the virus. Before one year of age, the child shouldn't fall ill. If they do, the illness is hard to treat. That's why parents whose children are younger than one year old must ensure that they themselves are vaccinated," Imnadze says.

Health officials have identified 9 new cases of measles in the past 10 days, bringing the total number recorded since May 2017, when the latest outbreak of the illness was first reported, to 3258.

The 9 people infected, reportedly all members of the Roma community, are receiving treatment at Kilkis Hospital in northern Greece, the country's union of public hospital workers (POEDIN) said on [Mon 15 Oct 2018].

POEDIN said about 200 staff at hospitals have been diagnosed with the disease since the outbreak started.

The Department of Health (DOH) office in Region 1 (Ilocos region) encouraged parents to avail of immunization for their children during the launching of the phase 2 of "Ligtas Tigdas" Supplemental Immunization Activity Plus 2018 at SM City [Rosales, Pangasinan province, Ilocos region] on [Sun 14 Oct 2018].

Dr Maria Wilda Silva, National Immunization Program (NIP) National Program Manager from DOH central office, said they chose the mall as the launch venue to take the opportunity to explain not only to the captured audience, but also mall-goers from Pangasinan and nearby towns of Tarlac the importance of immunization to the children.

Silva said vaccinations against measles started in 1963, in 1969 for rubella, 1997 for mumps, and 1963 for the oral polio vaccine.

She said polio in the Philippines was eliminated since year 2000, but there is a threat of possible outbreak because of what happened in Papua New Guinea and Lao People's Democratic Republic.

"We've eliminated polio and don't want it back. For hepatitis B, we have a program in which we call on all birthing centers and midwives that the Hepa birth dose must be given to the newborn child within 24 hours. If this is administered correctly and given to the child within the right time, vertical transmission is prevented," she added.

Silva said there are a lot of vaccines preventing diseases hence, the DOH is building again the trust and good relationship between the community and the vaccinators.

"It's not looking good, the number of children who are brought to the health centers for vaccines decreased. The usual reasons are: because of Dengvaxia controversy, parents got scared of immunization for their children, both parents are working and the child is left to a babysitter who can't decide whether to immunize the child during mobile immunization programs, (and) there are still misconceptions such as allow the measles to break out before immunizing the child, what they do not know is the child might die due to complications," she said.

She added that anti-polio vaccine is being given to children aged 0-59 months, while the measles vaccine is being administered to children aged 6 months-59 months.

In Region 1, there were 3 confirmed measles cases in 2017, of which 2 were from La Union province and one from Pangasinan.

There were no reported casualties.

In 2018, a total of 29 cases have been recorded.

Silva told the parents that the immunization or vaccination is free. "We are working hard for our budget, so that the immunization program of the government will continue," she said.

Silva led the ceremonial polio and measles vaccination to a number of children present during the launch, while others would receive the vaccines at their respective Rural Health Units.

The number of measles cases worldwide is increasing. [In August 2018 it was reported] that more than 41 000 people have been infected with measles in the World Health Organization's (WHO's) European Region for the 1st 6-months of 2018, already exceeding 12-month totals for any year this decade, the WHO Regional Office for Europe reported.

The previous European Region 12-month record was 23 927 cases for all of 2017, the WHO said.

According to these health officials, measles outbreaks are directly related to suboptimal vaccination coverage.

As an example, on 16 Jul 2018, the WHO reported only 4 EU/EEA countries have met the 95 percent vaccination goal for both doses of measles-containing vaccine during 2017.

Separately, the measles outbreak news in South America is equally concerning.

On 24 Jul 2018, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) latest update reported a total of 2472 confirmed cases of measles from 11 countries in the Americas so far this year [2018].

The majority of the 2018 measles cases occurred in Venezuela (1613 cases) and Brazil (1053), followed by the United States.
