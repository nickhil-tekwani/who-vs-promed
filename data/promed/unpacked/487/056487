In Germany, _Citrus bark cracking viroid_ (CBCVd - EPPO A2 List) was first reported from hop fields (_Humulus lupulus_) in Bavaria in July 2019 (EPPO RS 2019/165) [ProMED post 20190910.6665785]. Surveys found CBCVd in 12 hop gardens of 3 producers.

Surveys in 2020 of 672 hop gardens in 10 administrative districts found the viroid in 2 districts in 27 hop gardens belonging to 7 producers (including 15 fields of the 3 producers from 2019), covering a total of 93.6 ha. The infection level varied strongly between fields, from one infected plant per field up to nearly 100% of plants. It was shown that the spread of the disease was linked to the movement of infected plants and the sharing of machinery.

A survey in 2021 found infections at 2 further hop producers. In total, CBCVd was found in 32 hop gardens covering an area of 92 ha (in 2019-2021, some hop plots were cleared resulting in a decrease of 5 ha of the infested area).

It is considered that CBCVd has been present in Bavaria for at least 7 years and that eradication is no longer possible. Containment measures are applied and include removal and destruction of infected plants (including the roots), prohibition to use hop residues from the whole production site to produce biogas, prohibition to share machinery or sell hop planting material from an infected place of production.

[_Citrus bark cracking viroid_ (genus _Cocadviroid_, CBCVd; previously _Citrus viroid IV_) is one of at least 7 viroids of family Pospiviroidae known to occur in citrus hosts. In 2015, hop was reported for the 1st time as a new host in Slovenia (ProMED post 20150708.3494568) when CBCVd was found to cause a new disease of the crop that spread extremely rapidly. Symptoms included yellowing and distortion of leaves, reduced cone production, severe stunting and death of affected plants. _Hop stunt viroid_ (HSVd; genus _Hostuviroid_) had also been detected in some of the plants, but was not identified as the cause of the new disease.

While no information seems to be available so far on the status of HSVd in the infected areas in Bavaria, multiple viral or viroid infections are common in field plants with the potential for synergism (symbiotic enhancement of disease). Synergistic coinfections of CBCVd with a number of other viroids have been shown to lead to high plant mortality in hops (see links below). Vegetative propagation, which is used, for example, for hops and citrus, increases the risk of a buildup of these pathogens in a crop.

Most viroids, including CBCVd, can be spread by mechanical means, such as contaminated cutting tools and with infected plants or cuttings. Disease management of viroids may include phytosanitation (removal of infected plants, disinfection of orchard tools) and use of certified clean planting material.
