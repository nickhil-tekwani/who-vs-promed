Mystery disease kills Northwest Trek rabbits
-----------------
Nine pygmy rabbits died at Northwest Trek near Eatonville during the
past month as an unexplained disease swept through the endangered population.
Trek officials said the deaths constituted about half of the stock,
which was being bred and reared in captivity for eventual release
into the wild.
The cause of the rabbits' deaths is unknown, but "the situation is
being handled as a highly contagious, acutely lethal disease,"
according to a news release.
They were of normal weight and eating well before their deaths, the
release said.
There "were no visible signs of distress or abnormal behavior within
hours" of their deaths.
Daily treatment
The remaining rabbits were moved indoors and isolated in a clinic,
where they're getting daily medical treatment.
The sudden deaths canceled Trek's plans to release some of the
animals into Washington's Columbia Basin later this month.
Trek is one of several partners in the Pygmy Rabbit Recovery Program
led by the State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the news release said.
The Oregon Zoo and Washington State University also participate. Trek
was scheduled to release at least 5 rabbits.
Animals from Oregon and WSU will be set free in Douglas County as
planned Tuesday [13 Mar 2007], the news release added.
Wildlife officials announced this week they planned to release 23 of
the captively bred animals. They are to be placed in artificial
burrows until they can dig their own.
The Columbia Basin Pygmy Rabbit is listed on the state and federal
endangered species lists. To ensure the survival of some pygmy
rabbits, animals from the Columbia Basin stock were crossbred with
Idaho pygmy rabbits, according to a news release from the wildlife service.
The Trek rabbits, part of the breeding and rearing program, were not
on public display.

["Pygmy Rabbit (_Brachylagus idahoensis_) is listed as an endangered
species in the state of Washington, and on the Federal Endangered
Species List. Idaho lists it as a State Species of Concern. This
rabbit very small, and typically brown to slate gray. Its ears have a
white margin and it has a small tail. It has a very small and
depressed population size and is threatened by habitat loss and
predation as well as some introduced diseases.
While a few rabbits remain in the wild, most of the remaining
population has been placed in 2 captive breeding programs. Probably
less than 50 rabbits of this subspecies remain.
"The smallest rabbit species in North America, the pygmy rabbit
measures 9.2-11.6 inches (23.5-29.5 cm) in length, weighs a slight
0.88-1.02 lbs (398-462 g), and is able to fit in the palm of a hand.
Unlike other rabbit species, the pygmy rabbit digs its own burrows in
deep, loose soil. They are dependent upon sagebrush for food,
comprising 98 percent of their winter diet and a good portion of
their spring and summer diet. Mortality, chiefly from predation, is
high for both juveniles (an estimated 50 percent don't survive the
1st 5 weeks) and also the species in general, which has a mortality
rate of up to 88 percent per year. Predators include weasels, coyote,
badgers, bobcats, raptors, and humans, as many hunters can't
distinguish them from other rabbit species. It is suggested that
areas of tall sagebrush, a specialized habitat requirement, can be
promoted by disturbances such as ungulate grazing and perhaps even by
the burrowing and feeding activities of the rabbits themselves.
Relatedly, more research needs to be conducted on how cattle grazing
affects key habitat for the pygmy rabbit. Though the historical
population and range of the pygmy rabbit is unclear, evidence
suggests it was significantly larger than at present. This decline is
primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation through development,
agricultural conversion, and sagebrush burning to promote grasses for
livestock forage. The current population total is similarly unclear,
as some states (such as Washington) have active surveying programs
while others have virtually none. In severe danger of extinction, the
Washington population has declined from an estimated 250 rabbits in
1995 to a current estimate of zero. Several small populations known
to exist 6 years ago are now extirpated due to wildfire and disease.
Recently the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) has
initiated a captive-breeding program with hopes of revitalizing the
population. There are 6 rabbits currently in captivity and they are
hoping to find a total of 20 for the program. Originally planning on
crossbreeding with Idaho pygmies, the idea was scrapped in favor of
preserving the Washington sub-species when it was found the 2 are
genetically different. Strategies to enhance pygmy rabbit habitat and
population numbers outlined in the Washington State 1995 recovery
plan are many and include: monitoring, determining population trends
through burrow surveys, developing techniques for estimating numbers,
researching the effects of grazing, protecting the population through
fire management, keeping track of relative abundance of predators,
enhancing existing habitat, and creating new suitable habitat and
habitat corridors."
Indeed with so few of this species, the deaths at the captive center
are quite alarming.
There is not enough information here to understand the clinical signs
of the illness or the deaths to completely understand what is
happening to the animals. We will hope for speedy recovery and for
more information from an authoritative source.
