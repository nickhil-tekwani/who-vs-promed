[The state-by-state case count above is the most recent one issued by the CDC. The number of reported cases has increased in every category. This is not surprising since August is a month of active virus transmission. The non-neuroinvasive case count is likely significantly less than the actual number because the CDC states that 8 of 10 West Nile virus (WNV) infections are unapparent or very mild, transient febrile infections of individuals who do not seek medical attention. The CDC states that about one in 150 people who are infected develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system, such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord). Additional information is available at https://www.cdc.gov/westnile/index.html. This site also has a map showing WNV human cases from 2003 to present [2018].

WNV is now well established in the lower 48 states; vector mosquitoes are relatively abundant, and human cases, as well as cases in unvaccinated equine animals, can be expected every year. There is no commercially available vaccine for human application, so avoidance of mosquito bites is the only practical preventive measure available. - Mod.TY
