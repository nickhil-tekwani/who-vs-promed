[The HPAI epizootic caused by avian influenza virus subtype H5N8 was confirmed in November 2016 and resulted in a number of outbreaks, the latest was reported to OIE in May 2017. Over this 6-month period, more than 500 000 vaccinations were effected as vaccination was adopted right from the epizootic inception.

The disease is seemingly still smoldering, in parallel with the enzootic HPAI H5N1 present in the country since 2006. - Mod.AB

Subscribers may find the following abstract, from a paper authored by Egyptian and US researchers, of interest (ref 1).

Abstract
--------
A newly emerged H5N8 influenza virus was isolated from green-winged teal in Egypt during December 2016. In this study,
we provide a detailed characterization of full genomes of Egyptian H5N8 viruses and some virological features. Genetic
analysis demonstrated that the Egyptian H5N8 viruses are highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. Phylogenetic analysis
revealed that the genome of the Egyptian H5N8 viruses was related to recently characterized reassortant H5N8 viruses of
clade 2.3.4.4 isolated from different Eurasian countries. Multiple peculiar mutations were characterized in the Egyptian H5N8
viruses, which probably permits transmission and virulence of these viruses in mammals. The Egyptian H5N8 viruses
preferentially bound to avian-like receptors rather than human-like receptors. Also, the Egyptian H5N8 viruses were fully
sensitive to amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors. Chicken sera raised against commercial inactivated avian influenza-
H5 vaccines showed no or very low reactivity with the currently characterized H5N8 viruses in agreement with the genetic
dissimilarity. Surveillance of avian influenza in waterfowl provides early warning of specific threats to poultry and human
health and hence should be continued.
