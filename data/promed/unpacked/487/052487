["Bluetongue situation in the EU has considerably changed in recent times with incursions of new serotypes, namely of serotype 8 (in an area of the EU where outbreaks have never been reported before and which was not considered at risk of bluetongue) and also of serotype 1 of that virus on southern Europe.

"Council Directive 2000/75/EC (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02000L0075-20130701) lays down control rules and measures to combat bluetongue in the EU, including the establishment of protection and surveillance zones and a ban on animals of the susceptible species leaving those zones. Exemptions from that ban may be decided by the Commission in accordance with the procedure provided for in that Directive. The demarcation of protection and surveillance zones must take account of geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors connected with bluetongue and of the control arrangements. In order to take account of those factors, it was deemed necessary to lay down rules as regards the minimum harmonised requirements for monitoring and surveillance of bluetongue in the Community.

"The list of restriction zones per bluetongue serotype that have been demarcated by the EU Member States can be found in the following table that shows the latest information regarding this issue. See table at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones.pdf (Updated 10 Oct 2018)."

A map showing the location of the restriction zones is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg (Updated 10 Oct 2018).
