On 13 February, an outbreak of an unidentified disease was reported to have
occurred in Darwaz, Badakhshan. Symptoms were described as fever, cough,
vomiting and diarrhoea, with infants and the elderly being most severely
affected.
On 19 February the local authorities, in collaboration with WHO staff in
the area, transported emergency medical supplies to 5 villages in a valley
east of Nusai along the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan. The
epidemic was found to be still ongoing, and blood and stool samples were
taken and sent for analysis to the National Institute of Health in
Islamabad, Pakistan. Preliminary figures for these 5 villages (of the 18
reported to be affected) are approximately 6,300 cases and 135 deaths. As
communications and transportation are extremely difficult, current reports
are incomplete with respect to villages affected and number of deaths, and
the etiology of the disease is still unknown.
A specialized WHO team has left for the area to carry out a full
investigation in collaboration with local health authorities and community
leaders, to propose an action plan for response to the outbreak, and to
coordinate further surveillance and disease control activities with other
international agencies.
