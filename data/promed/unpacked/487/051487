Bird flu returned to the Ukraine
-----------------------------------------------------
The highly pathogenic virus of bird flu has been found again in
Crimea. 2 hens and a rooster were found dead in a private yard in the
village Kirovskoe of the Chernmorskoe region. Specimens, taken from
dead birds and from additional 2 hens and 2 ducks, have reacted
positive for DNA of influenza A, serotype H5 on 6 Feb 2008.
Additional samples have been sent to the State Research Institute for
Laboratory Diagnostic and Veterinary and Sanitary Expertise, Kiev
(national laboratory), for reconfirmation.

The bird-flu virus was found on 18 Jan 2008 in a bird farm of the
village Rovnoe, Krasnogvargeyskoe region, Crimea. The virus was
eventually confirmed to be H5N1.

[Ukraine submitted to the OIE on 21 Jan 2008 its immediate
notification on the outbreak in Crimea, which had started on 15 Jan
2008. A follow-up report, sent on 31 Jan 2008, indicated that no new
cases were recorded. Unfortunately this situation seems to have
changed now; an update will help.

For the OIE reports and a map, see

A new follow-up is due. - Mod. AS]
