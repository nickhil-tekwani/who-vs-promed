Japan prepares as O157 strikes again; Ed Gutierrez:
Japanese health officials are preparing to prevent an outbreak of O157
Escherichia coli on a scale similar to last year's. 126 people have been
infected, of whom one has died.
The death late last month startled
public-health officials into disseminating food-preparation guidelines
for small and medium sized outlets. Similar guidelines for larger
institutions that serve food were distributed after last year's
epidemic, which infected 9451 people and left 12 dead. The main outbreak
then was in elementary schools in Sakai City, Osaka; the source was
believed to be radish sprouts. A national association of radish growers
and the owners of [the farm] which has been described as the
originator of the infection, have filed compensation suits against the
government.
