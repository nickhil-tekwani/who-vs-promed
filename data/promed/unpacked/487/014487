Between July 2021 and mid-April 2022, the Ministry of Health recorded 1093 suspected epizootics of yellow fever, of which 25 (2.3%) were confirmed by laboratory criteria. Epizootics are the deaths of non-human animals [primates] as a result of the disease and can indicate the presence of the virus in a certain region and, with that, the risk of infection in humans. Monkeys, of different species, are the main hosts of the yellow fever virus. In the same period, 485 suspected human cases of yellow fever were reported, of which 4 (0.8%) were confirmed.

Transmission of the virus between non-human primates (NHP) was recorded in Pará, Minas Gerais, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul, signaling the active circulation of the virus in these states and the increased risk of transmission to human populations during the seasonal period, which runs from December to May. The confirmed human cases had a probable site of infection in Pará (municipalities of Afuá and Oeiras do Pará) and in Tocantins (municipality of São Salvador do Tocantins).

[Yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic in Brazil but the risk of human yellow fever virus infections has expanded from its traditional localities to new corridors of transmission. Although these human YF cases are the result of spillover from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle the risk remains that infected individuals could carry the virus into more urban or periurban settings where the urban vector, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant and initiate outbreaks of this disease. The challenge is maintenance of 80% immunity of the population through ongoing vaccination in remote rural areas where individuals are likely to be in contact with forest ecosystems.

Yellow fever is not only a public health risk. As Mod.PMB noted earlier in ProMED post 20211005.8698865, it is also a concern for the conservation of non-human primates that are endangered or threatened with extinction, such as brown howler monkeys (_Alouatta guariba_) and golden lion tamarins (_Leontopithecus rosalia_), that experience high case fatality rates when infected by YF virus. As mentioned in earlier posts, the greatest risk for YF adverse population effects is the muriqui monkey (_Brachyteles_), Brazil's largest primate and one of the planet's 25 most endangered species of primates. There are 2 species of muriqui monkey in Brazil: the northern muriqui (_B. hypoxanthus_) that has been on the IUCN's (International Union for Conservation of Nature) critically endangered list for more than 25 years, and the southern muriqui (_B. arachnoides_), which has been placed on that list more recently.

The previous report indicates that brown howler monkeys (_A. guariba_) and masked titis (_Callicebus personatus_) are the non-human primates most affected in this YF outbreak. However, the buffy-headed marmoset (_Callithrix flaviceps_) is also mentioned. It is a rare species of marmoset endemic to the rainforests of southeastern Brazil and occurs in southern Espírito Santo and possibly northern Rio de Janeiro, and its distribution extends into Minas Gerais, the very areas where yellow fever has been occurring. Unfortunately, there is no feasible way to halt YF virus transmission among these non-human primates. Killing them is not a solution. One hopes that enough individuals will survive for the species to recover. - Mod.TY
