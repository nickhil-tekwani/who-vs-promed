The worst-ever season for yellow rust may be in prospect as high levels of an aggressive strain of the disease are being seen in winter wheat in eastern England.

The warning comes from Bill Clark, NIAB [National Institute of Agricultural Botany] who says that even varieties with a high yellow rust resistance score were showing disease. "The inoculum has established itself in the crop in the autumn," said Mr Clark.

The yellow rust population is now dominated by the aggressive Warrior strain, named after a previously resistant [wheat] variety on which it was discovered. "It probably came from China, and those that think they know yellow rust could be in for a surprise. We may be heading into the worst yellow rust year ever," warned Mr Clark.

Where the disease is present, he said a holding spray would be advisable to keep levels down ahead of fungicide programmes starting in earnest. Only a long and sustained period of frost and low temperatures would have any meaningful control on the disease.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Between seasons, the fungus survives on living host plants generating a "green bridge." Disease management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or new "virulences" (ability to break down disease resistance conferred by specific host genes). Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
