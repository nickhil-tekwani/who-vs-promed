Doctors at the District Hospital in Myagdi warn of a spike in dengue and scrub typhus cases with the onset of summer. The hospital recently diagnosed a teenager with both dengue and scrub typhus.

According to doctors, a 17-year-old boy from Arman in Mangala Rural Municipality was tested positive for dengue and scrub typhus. The patient was admitted to the District Hospital in Myagdi following complaints of headache, fever, and joint pain 4 days ago. On 16 Feb [2020], a 45-year-old woman from Beni was also diagnosed with dengue at the District Hospital in Myagdi.

"This is the season when we see the most dengue and scrub typhus infections," said Prakash Sharma, information officer at the hospital. Doctors said that since dengue and the novel coronavirus have some similar symptoms, patients and their families tend to panic. "It's important to not panic during these times," said Sharma.

Health workers in Myagdi have advised people to adopt preventive measures to control the spread of dengue and scrub typhus, citing them as easily transmissible diseases.

Scrub typhus, also known as bush typhus, is an infectious disease that is caused by the parasite _Orientia tsutsugamushi_, a mite-borne bacterium, and spreads in the human body after getting bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice. High fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, dull red rash, nausea, and vomiting are some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may start bleeding, which could lead to organ failure and turn fatal if left untreated. The country saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the 2015 earthquakes.

"Dengue cases begin to surface at the beginning of the summer season. But this year [2020], we had our 1st case in February [2020] in Myagdi," said Sanjog Timilsina, a lab technologist at the District Hospital in Myagdi.

According to the data at the District Hospital, 14 dengue cases were reported in Myagdi since mid-August 2019. All of those infected are from Beni. In January [2020], a scrub typhus case was also identified in a 66-year-old at the same hospital.

[Myagdi District, with a population of 113 641 residents in 2011, is one of the 77 districts of Nepal; its district headquarters is Beni Urban Municipality, with a population of 28 511 residents in 2011 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myagdi_District). Mangala is one of 5 rural municipalities in Myagdi District, and Arman is a village with a population of 3867 residents (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arman,_Nepal). A map showing its location in central Nepal can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myagdi_District#/media/File:Myagdi_district_location.png.

An earthquake occurred in Nepal on 25 Apr 2015 that killed nearly 9000 people and injured nearly 22 000 with hundreds of thousands of Nepalese made homeless across many districts of the country (https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2015-nepal-earthquake-facts). In 2016, 70% of people displaced by the earthquake were still living in substandard temporary shelters (https://www.worldvision.org/disaster-relief-news-stories/2015-nepal-earthquake-facts).

The diagnosis of scrub typhus in Nepal has increased since the 2015 earthquake with 101 cases of scrub typhus in 2015, 831 cases in 2016, and 1435 cases in 2017-2018. This had been attributed to people living in temporary shelters where they might have been exposed to the infected chiggers, but some of this increase may be due to enhanced surveillance for this disease.

However, the laboratory method by which the diagnosis of scrub typhus was made in these patients is not stated. Scrub typhus presents clinically with chills, fever, headache, muscle pain, and sometimes with a macular or maculopapular rash and eschar at the site of the chigger bite; confirmation requires laboratory testing, usually by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay, but this will require a 4-fold rise in antibody titer between acute and convalescent specimens. Results from a single acute serum sample are unreliable, as it takes 7-10 days for IgG antibody to be detectable, and antibody will be present in a high percentage of healthy people in an endemic region. The Weil-Felix test is unreliable (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16941792), and molecular methods like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may not be available in endemic regions. - Mod.ML]
