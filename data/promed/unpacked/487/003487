LEISHMANIASIS DIAGNOSIS BY PCR: RFI
===================================

Subject: Leishmaniasis DX by PCR

Our group is planning a study using a novel PCR for differential diagnosis
of genital ulcers in humans in African contexts. In this target population,
leishmania are not uncommonly identified in genital ulcer lesions. Does
anyone know if there is a PCR assay for this parasite? I'd appreciate
whatever specifics (probes, manufacturer, species variation, etc.) that are
available.
