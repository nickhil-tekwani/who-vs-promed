Malaria cases on Penang island continue to rise with the latest official
numbers at 54, compared to Saturday's 49.
Penang deputy health director Dr Azmi Sapie said that out of the total, 12
were locals while 42 were Indonesians, the Sun reported yesterday. Over the
weekend, the number of infected Indonesians was 38.
Dr Azmi said the outbreak was still concentrated at Thean Teik district in
Air Itam.
He said that an ongoing "mass blood survey", which began at construction
sites about 10 days ago, had revealed that "quite a number" of Indonesians
had been infected with malaria.
The Sun quoted him as saying that so far, the health authorities had taken
1300 blood samples from local and foreign residents in Thean Teik.
