A south Reno resident contracted [a] hantavirus [infection], a sometimes deadly disease typically spread by deer mice, the Washoe District Health Department reported Thursday [15 Aug 2019]. It's the 1st Washoe County case since 2 were reported in 2017.

The condition of the person was not reported.

The disease is spread by inhaling or touching particles with the virus. "This typically occurs when working or recreating in areas where mouse droppings, urine, or saliva may have collected or when cleaning up rodent droppings or nesting material," the health department said in a statement. "Hikers and campers may be at higher risk if they are in areas that are common for heavy rodent infestation such as old cabins and barns."

"Be mindful when cleaning your garage or shed," Health Officer Kevin Dick said in a statement. "Look for rodent infestation and follow specific guidelines when cleaning areas with rodent activity."

Symptoms develop anywhere from a few days up to 6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms can include fever, headache, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle aches, chills, and dizziness. The symptoms that develop later include shortness of breath and fluid buildup in the lungs [hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome].

[Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in the Intermountain West of the USA, including Nevada. The Sin Nombre hantavirus and its deer mouse host are thus implicated as the source of the virus in this case, even though no details of circumstances under which this patient acquired the infection are given. The disease can progress rapidly to serious pulmonary compromise, so early medical attention is essential. The advice routinely offered or prevention of exposure to Sin Nombre virus should be heeded not only in Nevada, but also throughout the deer mouse's extensive geographic range, and includes:

- Air out closed-up buildings, storage rooms, trailers, cabins and overwintered vehicles before entering.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Soak down rodent nests and droppings using a disinfectant [such as a 10% bleach solution] before cleaning up.
- Don't sweep rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles to reduce attracting rodents.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.
