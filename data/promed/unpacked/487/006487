Indonesia: Rabies spreads in Jambi
----------------------------------
Dozens of residents have [contracted] rabies in Marosebo District,
Muarojambi Regency, over the past month, resulting in one death. Most of
the victims have been elementary school students between the ages of 7 and
12, said Muarojambi regency administration spokeswoman Idaryani on Thu 23
Jun 2005.
She said of the 14 people infected with the virus, 7 lived in the
Tanjungkatung subdistrict and the rest lived in the neighboring Setiris
subdistrict. Some of the victims were treated at the hospital, while others
sought treatment at community health centers, said Idaryani.
Tanjungkatung subdistrict head Sarbaini announced earlier in June 2005 that
7 residents of the subdistrict were infected with rabies. The Regency
health office has said it will kill wild dogs in the area to stop the
spread of the virus.

[There are several inconsistencies in this report. Within the past month,
one death has occurred among "dozens" (at least 21 people, mostly children)
reported to have been "infected with rabies". It is unclear whether the
others survived because they had suffered dog bites but did not develop
disease, or because they had received post exposure prophylaxis. Further
information would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
