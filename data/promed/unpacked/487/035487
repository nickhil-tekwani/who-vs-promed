----------------------------------------------------------------------
In June 2012, in Mojiang Hani Autonomous County, Yunnan Province, China, severe pneumonia without a known cause was diagnosed in 3 persons who had been working in an abandoned mine; all 3 patients died. Half a year later, we investigated the presence of novel zoonotic pathogens in natural hosts in this cave. For the investigation, we collected anal swab samples from 20 bats (_Rhinolophus ferrumequinum_), 9 rats (_Rattus flavipectus_), and 5 musk shrews (_Crocidura dracula_) from the mine for virome analysis.

We report on a novel henipa-like virus, Mojiang paramyxovirus (MojV), in [3 out of 9] rats (_Rattus flavipectus_) in China. _Rattus flavipectus_ rats are the natural reservoir of MojV. This finding and its context indicate that _Henipavirus_ spp viruses might infect more mammalian hosts than previously thought and that bats may not be the only hosts of henipaviruses.

The genus _Henipavirus_ (family _Paramyxoviridae_) contains 3 established species (Hendra virus, Nipah virus, and Cedar virus) and about 20 newly identified species. To date, bats were recognized as the reservoir hosts of henipaviruses.

The findings reported suggest that this novel virus may be maintained in nature by rats, but the existing results are exiguous (9 rats, 20 bats, and 5 shrews). A more thorough investigation should be conducted to confirm that _R. flavipectus_ is the reservoir of this virus.

In addition, more research is needed to establish whether this new virus is zoonotic and was the cause of death of the 3 mine workers in 2012.
