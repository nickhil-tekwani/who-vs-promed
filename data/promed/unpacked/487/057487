Dog owners in Swadlincote are being warned to keep their pets safe after a case of Alabama Rot was confirmed by a vet.

Staff at Hartshorne Veterinary Surgery put out a plea warning after a poorly [unwell] dog was brought in with the serious disease which is often fatal.

The dog was being walked in Gorse Lane Fields towards Boothorpe shortly before its owner realised it had become poorly [unwell].

The pooch was brought in to the surgery in Repton Road, where a vet confirmed it was suffering with Alabama rot. The dog's condition is not known.

A spokesman from the vets said: "We would urge owners to avoid walking their dogs in muddy or woodland areas and to make sure that after walking them, they wash their paws, legs and underbelly.

"The dogs should also be checked regularly around those areas and if you see any lesions or any changes, to bring them straight to a vet."

The often fatal disease affects the animal's kidneys, making it very difficult to recover from. In May 2017, it was reported that 98 dogs have died due to the condition in the UK in 5 years.

The spokesman added: "It is fatal more times than not, but nobody knows exactly what causes it.

"We hope that we don't see another case of it because it is a very scary disease, but everyone needs to be aware of the risk and what they can do to try to avoid it."

Common symptoms of the disease include lesions or ulcerations on the dog's legs, paws or muzzle, a fever, vomiting and anorexia. Anyone who has a dog with any of the symptoms is encouraged to see a vet as soon as possible.

[The above report is the 7th one posted by us during the current year [2017], all addressing cases of Cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV, alias Alabama rot) in various districts in England.

A one-day-conference addressing CRGV was reportedly held on [Wed 10 May 2017] in Reading, Berkshire. The publication of its proceedings and conclusions is desirable.
