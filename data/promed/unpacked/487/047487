[Aujeszky's disease, also known as pseudorabies, is caused by _Suid herpesvirus 1_ (SHV-1), a member of the subfamily _Alphaherpesvirinae_ and the family _Herpesviridae_. The virus is generally handled in BSL-2 laboratories.

The virus infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, of a variety of mammals (such as dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, foxes, minks, etc) except humans and the tailless apes. It is associated primarily with pigs, the natural host, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks old, which die from encephalitis). In consequence, the pig is the only species able to survive a productive infection and therefore, serves as the reservoir host. In pigs, the severity of clinical signs depends on the age of the pig, the route of infection, the virulence of the infecting strain and the immunological status of the animal. Young piglets are highly susceptible with mortality rates reaching 100 percent during the 1st 2 weeks of age.

These animals show hyperthermia and severe neurological disorders: trembling, incoordination, ataxia, nystagmus (involuntary eye movement) to opisthotonos (abnormal posturing caused by strong muscle spasms) and severe epileptiform-like seizures. When pigs are older than 2 months (grower-finisher pigs), the respiratory forms become predominant with hyperthermia, anorexia, mild to severe respiratory signs: rhinitis with sneezing and nasal discharge may progress to pneumonia. The frequency of secondary bacterial infections is high, depending on the health status of the infected herd.

Sows and boars primarily develop respiratory signs, but in pregnant sows, the virus can cross the placenta, infect and kill the fetuses inducing abortion, return to oestrus (heat), stillborn fetuses. In the other susceptible species, the disease is fatal, the predominant sign being intense pruritus causing the animal to gnaw or scratch part of the body, usually head or hind quarters, until great tissue destruction is caused.

Focal necrotic and encephalomyelitis lesions occur in the cerebrum, cerebellum, adrenals, and other viscera such as lungs, liver or spleen. In fetuses or very young piglets, white spots on liver are pathognomonic of their infection by the virus. Intranuclear lesions are frequently found in several tissues.

Aujeszky's disease is endemic in many parts of the world, but several countries have successfully completed eradication programmes, such as the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and many Member States of the European Union.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refers to OIE Terrestrial Manual 2014, Chapter 2.1.2 "Aujeszky disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.02_AUJESZKYS_DIS.pdf (adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012)

The authorities indicate that advanced diagnostics tests were performed; however they did not specify which tests these were.
