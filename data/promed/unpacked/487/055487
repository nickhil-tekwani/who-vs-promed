Unimas to help curb outbreak of encephalitis
------------------------------------------------------
KUCHING - Universiti Malaysia Sarawak (Unimas), which has vast
experience in dealing with the viral outbreak which killed 30
children in Sarawak in 1996, is helping to curb the outbreak of
Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Peninsular Malaysia. "I have been
informed that the university has already sent an expert," Agriculture
Minister Datuk Amar Dr Sulaiman Daud said after attending a briefing
at the State Drainage and Irrigation Department headquarters here on
Jan 10.
He also said the department would enforce strict regulations on pig
farms, which were suspected to be the sources of JE in Peninsular
Malaysia. He said a circular was issued on Jan 6 [1999 to pig
breeders in Negri Sembilan, Perak and Malacca.
"I have informed the department to be very strict about the
enforcement of the regulations to prevent the spread of the disease."
Among the measures, he said, was to get rid of stagnant dirty water --
the breeding ground for culex mosquitoes -- around the pig farms.
The movements of pigs in Japanese encephalitis-infected areas in
Perak and Negri Sembilan had been further tightened, he said, adding
that they were only allowed to be transported from the pig farms to
the abattoirs. "The movement of sows and piglets in Peninsular
Malaysia has also been banned," he added.
Dr Sulaiman called on the pig breeders to co-operate with the
Veterinary Services Department and to report all occurrences of JE to
the department to enable further investigation to be the carried out.
"The department also wants all pig farms to be regularly cleaned to
prevent breeding of Culex mosquitoes. Breeders from non-infected
areas are also advised not to buy sows from infected areas without
referring the matter to the department until further notice."
Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said on Sunday that a fresh
supply of vaccine for Japanese encephalitis was expected to arrive
next week to replenish the dwindling stock of only 900 doses. "The
Cabinet has decided that those in the high risk group,particularly
pig farm workers and handlers, be given the priority to be
vaccinated," he added.
It has been reported that the group targeted for vaccination numbered
up to 160 000 people. The total cost of the exercise is expected to
be RM15 million. As at last Friday, 15 274 people from Perak and 576
from Negri Sembilan have already been vaccinated.
"The disease is at present confined to certain areas in Ipoh and
Negri Sembilan," he told reporters.
[Does this imply cases are still erupting in the area? - CM

The Japanese B Encephalitis (JE) outbreak in the country is under
control, Health Minister Datuk Chua Jui Meng said today. However,
preventive measures like fogging and anti-JE vaccinations were still
being conducted in the affected areas, he said.
"Those living near pig farms who contract fever will continue to be
admitted to the hospital for observation and treatment although they
may not be suffering from the JE disease," he told reporters after
visiting the Kuala Pilah Hospital, here.
The disease is spread from pigs to humans by the culex mosquito. Chua
said 34 people in Sikamat, Seremban, had been admitted to the
Seremban Hospital for checks and observation since the JE outbreak
in Kampung Wong Seng Chow, Sikamat and its surrounding areas.
Only two of them were confirmed to be suffering from the disease but
they had recovered and had been discharged. The three remaining
patients, who were not suffering from the disease, would be
discharged soon, he said.
Four people, including a 13-year-old girl, working in pig farms in
Kampung Wong Seng Chow, died between Jan 2 and 5, believed to be
victims of JE.
Chua said fogging [with insecticide would continue to be done in
Sikamat and Bukit Pelandok (Port Dickson) which had many pig farms.
He said that so far 1800 people in the two areas had been vaccinated
and he gave an assurance that there was ample supply of the vaccine.

The results of the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) tests on blood samples of
pigs in Negri Sembilan carrying the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus will be
known in a week.
The DNA tests, conducted at the Veterinary Research Institute here, were to
determine the origin of the JE virus found in pigs in Sikamat, Negri
Sembilan.
The institute's director, Dr Abdul Aziz Jamaluddin, said the tests used DNA
sequencing to determine the viral strain.
So far, 120 blood samples of pigs from four farms in Sikamat were found to
carry the JE virus but it has yet to be determined if the strain was the
same as those found in pigs in Ulu Piah, Tambun and Ampang in Perak.
Dr Abdul Aziz said yesterday that three strains of the JE virus had been
identified in Malaysia.
"The JE virus found in animals in Tambun, Ulu Piah and Ampang is unique."
An outbreak of the JE disease, which is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes,
in Perak in October claimed nine lives, and four deaths were reported
recently in Negri Sembilan.
