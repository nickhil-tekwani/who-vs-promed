Pigs, Bulls in Viet Nam Contract foot-and-mouth disease
-----------------------------------------------
Over 1000 pigs and bulls in Viet Nam's central highlands Lam Dong
province have been infected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in
recent days, local newspaper Labor reported Monday [17 Apr 2006].
[For Lam Dong, central south Viet Nam, see
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f0/Viet NameseProvincesMap.png>].
Most of the infected animals are in Duc Trong district [map at
<http://www.vnbd.com/maps/lam-dong.jpg>].

By 16 Apr 2005, some 1000 pigs in the district had contracted the
disease, and more than 400 of them had died, the paper quoted Pham
Ngoc Thiep, head of the Lam Dong Veterinary Bureau, as saying.
Relevant agencies are assessing the disease situation in Duc Trong
and tightening management over the transport of cattle and operation
of meat shops and slaughterhouses so that infected pigs are not
slaughtered or transported to the nearby resort city of Da Lat in Lam
Dong, he said, noting that the province may have to announce an
outbreak of FMD in its territory in the coming days.
Lam Dong currently has 669 poultry and cattle trading bases, nearly
500 of which operate without license, the newspaper said.

[FMD is known to be endemic in Viet Nam. According to the official
information duly provided by the Vietnamese authorities to the OIE
during 2004, cattle, buffaloes and pigs were reportedly affected by
serotypes O and A. In March 2005, the FAO World Reference Laboratory
for FMD at Pirbright, UK received 5 samples from Viet Nam, reportedly
collected from cattle during January 2005. All 5 were typed as FMD
serotype O. No official information on the situation in 2005 is
available on OIE's website, but according to a state-run newspaper,
testing on 19 samples from 268 pigs that died in June 2005 in Ca Mau
province (southern Viet Nam) indicated that they could have been
infected with FMD (see 20050706.1908).
An outbreak of a pig disease, suspected as FMD but later attributed
to classical swine fever, without lab confirmation, was reported from
another southern province, Long-An, in January 2006 (see references).
Laboratory confirmation of the currently suspected outbreaks, and --
in case confirmed -- data on the serotype involved and official
notification, are anticipated.
Since the beginning of 2005, FMD virus of Asia 1 serotype was
reported from several of China's provinces, as well as in several of
China's neighboring countries. See Laurence Gleeson's commentary in
20050520.1385 and FAO's overview in 20050624.1774. - Mod.AS]
