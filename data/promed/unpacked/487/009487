Two people in the city [Beijing] died of rabies in January this year [2013], the Beijing Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention has announced, the Beijing Youth Daily reported on Tuesday [5 Feb 2013].

One of them was bitten by a stray dog on the finger; the other was bitten on the finger by a pet dog. Neither person was vaccinated after the injuries.

Most rabies cases in Beijing involve adult males who are farmers or migrant workers. Half of the people who caught rabies were bitten by stray dogs, and most were not vaccinated.

[Travellers to Beijing should be aware that canine rabies, despite rigorous control measures implemented by the local authorities, remains prevalent in the Chinese capital. Anyone injured in an encounter with a stray dog should seek immediate post-exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.CP
