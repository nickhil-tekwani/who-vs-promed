The 1st cases of bluetongue virus have been found in 2 New Jersey deer.

The state Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Fish and Wildlife said Friday [10 Oct 2014] that the virus was found in a deer that died in Basking Ridge, Somerset County, on [4 Sep 2014], and [another that died] in Stirling, Morris County, on [19 Sep 2014].

Humans are not affected by the disease, but the state advises people against consuming meat from any animal that appears ill.

The disease is spread through the bite of a midge and is similar to epizootic hemorrhagic disease.

[Hemorrhagic disease (HD), caused by viruses in either the epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) or bluetongue virus (BTV) groups (_Reoviridae_: _Orbivirus_), is the most important viral disease affecting white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) in the United States. In North America there are 3 subtypes of EHD virus (EHDV 1, 2, and 6) and 5 subtypes of BT virus (BTV 2, 10, 11, 13, and 17). Isolated cases of BT viruses from infected deer were first reported in 1968, although white tail deer mortalities consistent with EHD/BT disease were noted as early as 1886. - Mod.PMB
