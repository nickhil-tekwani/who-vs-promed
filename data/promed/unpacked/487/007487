A hospital patient has been killed by a new strain of [_Staphylococcus
aureus_ that is [resistant to antibiotics. It is the first time the
[strain has been detected in Hong Kong, and was a direct consequence of
antibiotic abuse, a doctor warned.
The patient, a middle-aged female cancer patient, was admitted to Queen
Mary Hospital in mid-1998 with a fever, and died despite two weeks of
intensive drug treatment to combat the vancomycin-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ (VRSA). The [VRSA strain had previously been found only in Japan,
the United States and France.
University of Hong Kong microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung said that
when the bacteria spread, no antibiotic was effective and infections became
untreatable. "We are getting into the terminal stage. It is very
dangerous; the bacteria have broken the last defence," he said. "Ten years
ago, Hong Kong for the first time found Streptococcus pneumoniae had become
resistant to penicillin. Now, 70 per cent are penicillin-resistant,"
Professor Yuen said.
Staphylococcus aureus are virulent bacteria which live on human skin. They
enter the body through wounds and cause serious infections of the skin,
soft tissues, bones and joints. The organism spreads through direct
contact and can lead to pneumonia and the fatal bacteremia, which has a 40
per cent mortality rate.
Some strains of _Staphylococcus aureus_, known as methicillin-resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA), became resistant to the antibiotic
methicillin and cloxacillin in the late 1970s. Doctors have since then
relied on vancomycin as the final weapon in their defence arsenal.
Professor Yuen said doctors were left with only experimental drugs in the
fight against VRSA. Their effectiveness was still uncertain.
The new strain of _Staphylococcus aureus_ is more dangerous than
vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Enterococci, bacteria in the gut,
are less virulent.
The [VRSA strain was first found in Japan in 1997, when a boy's infected
surgical wound did not respond to 29 days of vancomycin treatment. Three
other cases have been reported in the US and one in France.
