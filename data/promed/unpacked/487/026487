Comment
-------
I've seen H1N1 patients with severe leukopenia and lymphocytopenia
during the acute infection. Such severe lymphocytopenia might
interfere with the ability to mount an adequate immune response. I've
also wondered what effect prompt antiviral therapy might have on the
immune response.

Comment
-------
The ProMED-mail report entitled "Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009
(114): USA (WV), repeat infection" regarding Dr Parsons reinfection
with A/H1N1/2009 is useful and I would encourage her to publish these
findings, if only to fill the data gap on this subject to which Dr
Gupta alludes.

Studies in humans (as opposed to mouse models) performed over 20
years ago with natural infection by different influenza A subtypes
suggest that influenza reinfection is not so uncommon, as the CDC has
indicated: rates of reinfection with influenza A/H3N2 have been as
high as 63 percent in consecutive seasons in one family study, which
included young children (1976/77 and 1977/78) (1); with influenza
A/H2N2 as high as 27 percent (17/62) within 6 months (2). This same
report also found a reinfection rate of 17 percent with A/H3N2
amongst students in 1970 and of 32 percent and 69 percent in 2 groups
of students in 1972, and of 32 percent in 1983 -- with the A/H3N2
viruses showing various degrees of antigenic drift. With A/H1N1,
reinfection rates of 9.3 percent and 20 percent were reported for 2
other student groups in 1980 (2).

Given the above, there may be no reason to expect this pandemic
human-adapted swine influenza virus A/H1N1/2009 to behave any
different?

The related question, of course, is how long one can expect the
A/H1N1/2009 vaccine-induced immunity to last -- though of course,
running parallel to this is ongoing A/H1N1/2009 viral mutation that
may require a change in vaccine antigen-specificity and
re-immunisation at a later date, anyway.

[Out correspondents suggest 2 explanations for this case of pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 virus reinfection in a mother and son. Dr Lenoir's
observations suggest that reinfection may on occasion be a
consequence of transient immune suppression, whereas Professor Tang
cites evidence that reinfection may occur more frequently than
currently supposed. These issues are relevant to the strategy of
vaccination and further comments would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
