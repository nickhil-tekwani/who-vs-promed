-------------------------------------------
On 6 Jun 2018 at 1:30 pm, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was notified of 3 related women who had arrived at a hospital 4 hours earlier for evaluation for acute nausea, dizziness, blurred vision, slurred speech, ptosis, thick-feeling tongue, and shortness of breath. Two patients developed respiratory failure, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the emergency department, and the 3rd patient was intubated at 7 pm that evening. The combination of cranial nerve palsies and respiratory failure in multiple patients suggested botulism, a paralytic illness caused by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), most commonly produced by _Clostridium botulinum_.

Approximately 14 hours before arriving at the hospital, the patients had shared a homemade potato salad containing home-canned peas. The family's freezer had malfunctioned, and, to preserve some commercially produced frozen peas, one of the patients had home-canned the peas 1-2 weeks before consumption. After consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC;https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/health-professional.html), botulinum antitoxin was released by CDC and administered to all patients within about 12 hours of arrival at the hospital. All 3 patients survived but required prolonged intensive care (range = 34-54 days) and rehabilitation.

Blood specimens were collected from 2 patients before administration of antitoxin, and stool specimens were collected from all 3 after antitoxin administration. Testing included mouse bioassay at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Public Health Laboratory and mass spectrometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and culture at the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center. All 3 stool specimens tested positive by RT-PCR for BoNT type A with a silent B gene (BoNT type A(B)). A wash from the empty jar that previously held the peas and residual food from the salad bowl also tested positive by RT-PCR for BoNT type A(B). Whole genome sequencing demonstrated that the isolates recovered from 2 stool specimens were indistinguishable from the salad bowl isolate. Other environmental samples, including different home-canned vegetables from the same batch, were negative for BoNT, confirming that the peas were the outbreak source.

The patient who prepared the home-canned peas was a novice home canner. She used a peach preserves recipe with a boiling water technique, replacing the peaches with frozen vegetables. The patient was unaware that low-acid foods (for example, vegetables) must be canned in a pressure canner rather than a boiling water canner to eliminate _C. botulinum_ spores (1). After the jars cooled, the patient correctly checked for jar seal. One of the jars of peas was not sealed, so the patient covered and refrigerated it, and the family consumed the peas in the potato salad. The US Department of Agriculture guidelines state that "foods in single unsealed jars could be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within several days" (1). However, this recommendation applies only to cans that have been correctly processed. In the absence of a pressure-canning step, _C. botulinum_ spores were not eliminated, and the closed jar created an anaerobic environment, allowing spore germination and BoNT production.

This outbreak illustrates the importance of educating home canners on safe home-canning practices to prevent botulism. Home-canned food, even when made with commercially processed ingredients, can lead to morbidity or mortality if canned incorrectly. Safe home-canning guidelines need to be followed (1), especially with low acidity foods, and when processing errors occur, foods should be discarded or reprocessed according to recommended guidelines within 24 hours.

[When the motor neuron action potential depolarizes the axon terminal, acetylcholine is released from the cytosol into the synaptic cleft. Botulism occurs when usually preformed toxin is absorbed through the intestinal tract, and when the botulinum toxin is exposed to the neuromuscular junction, the heavy chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds to glycoprotein structures specifically found on cholinergic nerve terminals. This specific docking is the reason for BT high selectivity for cholinergic synapses. After internalization, the light chain of the botulinum neurotoxin binds with high specificity to the SNARE protein complex. The target proteins vary among the BT serotypes. BT-A cleaves synaptosomal-associated proteins of 25kDa (SNAP-25). BT-B cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP), also known as synaptobrevin II.

An October 2013 article in PLoS Pathogens (1) found that several auxiliary proteins produced by the organism bound to botulinum toxin A and facilitated its absorption from the gastrointestinal tract via multivalent interactions with carbohydrate receptors on intestinal epithelial cells. Indeed, in mice it seemed possible to block the neuromuscular effects of botulinum toxin by blocking absorption using a non-metabolizable galactose analog called isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and prolonged median survival time. The same group more recently, in June 2014, published (2) that the same hemagglutinin complex of the progenitor toxin complex bound to E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, as well as carbohydrate binding and facilitated paracellular absorption of the toxin complex. Abolishing either the E-cadherin or carbohydrate binding of the toxin complex drastically reduced oral toxicity.
