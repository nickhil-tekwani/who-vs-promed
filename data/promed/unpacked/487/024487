22 horses from Kjalarnes in southwest Iceland have died from a
salmonella infection during the past week; 3 to 4 other horses
are mortally ill, although most of those infected are recovering. A
total of 41 horses were infected with salmonella.

"It is incredibly sad when they just die in your arms," MP Arni Pall
Arnason told Visir.is. He has lost one horse to the infection and has
spent most of his Christmas tending to sick horses in a stable in
Mosfellsbaer, and helped put those animals down who are beyond
recovery. Another of his horses is seriously ill.

The infection is believed to have come from a sedimentation pond in
the herd's pasturage.

Since Christmas Eve [2008], Arnason and his wife Sigrun have spent
the nights by the side of their horses. On 26 Dec 2008, Arnason lost
his horse Asi, who had been his companion for 7 years. It is unclear
whether his horse Aki, who is also infected, will survive.

Arnason said that Icelandic authorities have never had to deal with
such an extensive infection before.

[Salmonellosis is one of the most commonly diagnosed infectious
causes of diarrhea in adult horses. Clinical manifestations range
from no abnormal clinical signs (subclinical carrier) to acute,
severe diarrhea and even death. The high fatality rate in the
outbreak described is rather unusual; laboratory confirmation of
salmonellosis and -- if confirmed -- details of the identity of
the _Salmonella_ species involved, will be helpful. Other potential
etiological factors, infectious or otherwise, should be investigated.

The most virulent _Salmonella_ serovars in horses belong to serogroup
B, which includes _S. typhimurium_ and _S. agona_. Serogroups C and E
include also several species which will cause clinical disease in
horses.

The horse population of Iceland (2007 figures, OIE) was 55 000; other
sources quote somewhat higher figures. The Icelandic human population
is almost 300 000. This means a relatively high equine/human ratio.
Icelandic horses have been bred only with horses from Iceland since
the Middle Ages.

Owners should be made aware of the zoonotic risk of _Salmonella_ spp
infection. People working with infected animals should practice
strict hygiene. - Mod.AS]
