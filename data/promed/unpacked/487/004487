I am contacting you about an error in the ProMED-mail story [Rabies
vaccine: recall, from 1 Aug 2000 regarding the recall of our rabies
vaccine. It appears that you obtained this information from the MMWR, which
erroneously reported one of the recalled lot numbers. Lot number P0313-2 is
NOT recalled, the correct lot number is P0313-3.
