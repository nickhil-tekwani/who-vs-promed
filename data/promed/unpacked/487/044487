["Equine Infectious Anemia (EIA) is a viral disease affecting only members of the equidae family (horses, ponies, zebras, mules, and donkeys). There is no vaccine or treatment for the disease. Infection is often inapparent and results in a lifelong carrier state if the horse survives the acute phase of the infection. EIA is found widely throughout the world. There is no evidence that EIA is a threat to human health.

"The clinical signs are often nonspecific and of variable severity. Clinical signs in an acute case can range from fever and decreased appetite to severe anemia and sudden death. It is often difficult to differentiate EIA from other diseases. Incubation period is a week to 60 days or longer. Additional clinical signs in an acute case can include:
- Jaundice (yellow discoloration of mucous membranes)
- rapid breathing, rapid heart rate
- swelling of limbs
- bleeding from the nose, or red/purple spots on mucous membranes
- blood-stained feces

"Horses that survive the acute phase of the disease become chronic, inapparent carriers. Some carriers may develop recurrent flare-ups, often following another stress - illness or strenuous work. While donkeys and mules have the ability to contract this virus, most remain non-clinical.

"Natural transmission of EIA is by blood feeding flies (horse flies and deer flies) and is limited to relatively short distances. This virus is frequently transmitted via unclean or re-used needles and syringes, blood transfusions and contaminated instruments (IV sets, dental instruments, tattoo equipment). Mares can transmit the virus to foals in utero, and, less likely, transmission can occur via milk or semen".
