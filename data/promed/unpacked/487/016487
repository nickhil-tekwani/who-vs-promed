USDA PROPOSES COMPENSATION FOR THOSE AFFECTED BY KARNAL BUNT IN 1996-97
WASHINGTON, July 11, 1997--The U.S. Department of Agriculture today proposed
to amend the Karnal bunt regulations by adding compensation provisions for
certain growers, handlers, owners of grain storage facilities, and flour
millers who incur losses and expenses because of Karnal bunt in the 1996-97
crop season.
"The payment of compensation is necessary in order to reduce the economic
impact of the Karnal bunt regulations on affected wheat growers and other
individuals," said Michael V. Dunn, Assistant Secretary for marketing and
regulatory programs. "Compensation will also help obtain cooperation from
individuals affected by Karnal bunt eradication efforts."
Karnal bunt is caused by the smut fungus Tilletia indica and is spread by
spores. Karnal bunt was first detected in the United States in Arizona in
March of last year. The detection jeopardized billions of dollars' worth of
export markets for the U.S. wheat industry. While the fungus does not
threaten human health, flour made from heavily infected wheat has an
unpleasant odor and taste, jeopardizing its marketability; the disease also
reduces crop yields.
The proposed regulations would provide compensation to growers and handlers
of wheat grown in the regulated area for the loss in value of their 1996-1997
crop season wheat only if the wheat is tested by APHIS and is found positive
for Karnal bunt.
For growers and handlers in areas that became regulated for Karnal bunt
before the 1996-97 crop was planted, compensation for positive-testing wheat
will equal 60 cents per bushel. For growers and handlers in areas that
became regulated for Karnal bunt after the 1996-97 crop was planted,
compensation for positive wheat will be based on the difference between the
contract price (if sold under contract) or the estimated market price minus
the actual price received by the grower or handler, not to exceed $1.80 per
bushel.
The 1995-96 crop season compensation regulations provide compensation for
loss in value of wheat that had twice tested negative. The current proposal
does not compensate growers for negative-tested wheat harvested in 1997 in
the regulated area.
Owners of grain storage facilities would be eligible for compensation under
this proposal if they stored positive-testing grain. The compensation
proposal would pay the facility owners on a one-time basis for up to 50
percent of the cost of decontamination not to exceed $20,000 per premise.
This is the same as the compensation package for the 1995-96 crop year.
This proposal would compensate participants in the national Karnal bunt
survey whose wheat tests positive for Karnal bunt. USDA would quarantine the
facility and, if an extraordinary emergency has been declared in that state,
USDA would compensate the owner for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of
decontaminating the facility up to $20,000 per premise on a one-time basis.
USDA would also compensate the owner for the loss in value of the wheat at
the rate of $1.80 per bushel of positive-testing wheat.
APHIS is conducting the national survey to demonstrate to U.S. trading
partners the areas producing wheat for export are free of the disease. APHIS
anticipates completing the survey later this year.
Flour millers would also be eligible for compensation under this proposal if
they heat-treat millfeed from regulated areas in accordance with APHIS
protocols. The compensation rate would be $35 per short ton of millfeed.
Compensation payments for loss in value of wheat would be issued by the Farm
Service Agency in cooperation with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. Payments for decontamination and heat treating millfeed would be
issued by APHIS.
This compensation proposal follows a final rule that USDA published on April
25 that established criteria for levels of risk for areas with regard to
Karnal bunt for the 1996-97 crop year.
Included in that final rule were some changes to prior Karnal bunt
regulations established in a series of interim rules to guard against the
artificial spread of the disease from infested areas in Arizona, California,
New Mexico, and Texas.
There are now several distinct categories that apply within the regulated
areas in the four affected states. In all cases, the basis for determining
the Karnal bunt risk that may be present is the presence of bunted wheat
kernels. For wheat produced for seed, the entire regulated area is regarded
as a restricted area, and wheat seed produced in this area can not be moved
interstate except for research or testing purposes.
In the case of wheat grown for non-seed uses within the regulated areas,
fields may be determined to be restricted areas or surveillance areas.
Restricted areas are those areas where bunted kernels have been found
associated with wheat from these fields, or in seed used to plant these
fields.
Regulations prohibit the planting of wheat in fields designated as restricted
fields. Surveillance areas are areas surrounding restricted fields, or which
have otherwise been determined to be at risk for Karnal bunt. Wheat
harvested from surveillance areas must be tested before it can be moved out
of the regulated area.
Wheat testing negative for Karnal bunt will be certified and can move without
restriction. Wheat testing positive can only move under limited permit, and
with certain restrictions.
Fields in the regulated area that tested positive during the 1996 harvest or
were planted with contaminated seed in 1995 may not be planted in a host crop
in the 1996-97 crop season. Host crops include wheat, durum wheat, and
triticale, a hybrid of wheat and rye.
This proposed rule will be published in the July 11 Federal Register.
Consideration will be given to comments received on or before Sept. 9.
