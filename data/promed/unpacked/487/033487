This year's 1st African swine fever (ASF) infection for domestic pigs has been registered in Latvia. The illness was uncovered in an enclosure in Durbe Parish, Vecpils County. A total of 49 pigs have been killed to halt the spread of the disease, as reported by Food and Veterinary Service (FVS).

The affected farm has been put under quarantine - a protection zone in a 3 km [approx. 1.8 mi] radius and an observation zone in a 10 km [approx. 6.2 mi] radius around it. All other enclosures in this area will be put under intense supervision for compliance with bio-security measures. Transportation of pigs and pork to and from this area will be put under increased control as well.

FVS reminds farmers who have pigs in the monitoring zone that it is prohibited to carry pigs between farms, as well as carry pigs and pork from the protection zone. FVS has commenced an epidemiological investigation to determine how the virus got in the enclosure.

FVS urges farmers to be responsible and keep in mind - to protect domestic pigs from ASF, it is necessary to strictly follow bio-security measures:

- it is necessary to prevent contact of domestic pigs with wild and stray animals;
- avoid using bedding that may have had contact with wild animals;
- pigs should not be fed leftover food, grass cut from yard, potatoes that have not undergone thermal treatment, etc.;
- avoid taking water to be given to pigs from open water reservoirs;
- when taking care of animals, use only appropriate clothes and shoes that are not at work outside the enclosure;
- ensure shoes and other specialized footwear undergoes proper disinfection at the entrance to the enclosure and perform other disinfection measures. It is also necessary to disinfect vehicles that travel to and from the farm grounds;
- if pigs look unhealthy - call veterinarians immediately!
