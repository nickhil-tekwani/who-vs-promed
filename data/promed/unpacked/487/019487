Abstract
The past several months have witnessed the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with novel spike protein mutations that are influencing the epidemiological and clinical aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These variants can increase rates of virus transmission and/or increase the risk of reinfection and reduce the protection afforded by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies and vaccination. These variants can therefore enable SARS-CoV-2 to continue its spread in the face of rising population immunity while maintaining or increasing its replication fitness. The identification of 4 rapidly expanding virus lineages since December 2020, designated variants of concern, has ushered in a new stage of the pandemic. The 4 variants of concern, the alpha variant (originally identified in the UK), the beta variant (originally identified in South Africa), the gamma variant (originally identified in Brazil), and the delta variant (originally identified in India), share several mutations with one another as well as with an increasing number of other recently identified SARS-CoV-2 variants. Collectively, these SARS-CoV-2 variants complicate the COVID-19 research agenda and necessitate additional avenues of laboratory, epidemiological and clinical research.

Key points
- The past several months have witnessed the emergence of 4 SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (alpha, beta, gamma and delta) associated with increased transmissibility, increased risk of reinfection and/or reduced vaccine efficacy.
- Many additional SARS-CoV-2 variants sharing mutations and biological features with these variants are also increasingly being identified.
- The increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 variants share a repertoire of mutations that is enabling the virus to spread despite rising population immunity while maintaining or increasing its replication fitness.
- Whereas most emerging mutations reduce the protective effects of neutralizing antibodies generated by infection and vaccination, several recently identified mutations appear to antagonize the innate immune response to initial infection.
- The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants requires an expanded research agenda to improve our understanding of emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations and the correlates of protective immunity against variants with these mutations.

[This article is an outstanding structural and functional review of the critical mutations seen in 4 different SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and their wide-ranging effects, including the conformation of the spike protein and immune epitopes, and susceptibility to neutralization by candidate therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, antibodies found in convalescent plasma, and antibodies generated by different vaccines that have been deployed to help control the pandemic. As a result, the authors are able to conclude: "The alpha and delta variants are each associated with increased transmissibility and greater disease severity because of immune evasion, and potentially because of higher virus levels resulting from the antagonism of innate immunity. The beta and gamma variants are each associated with increased transmissibility because of their ability to evade humoral immunity and cause reinfections." Please refer to the original report at the URL above for full details and informative graphs and tables.

In addition, the data that went into this review continue to be updated and publicly available at the Stanford Coronavirus Antiviral & Resistance Database website (https://covdb.stanford.edu), providing a great service to the scientific community.

[2] Limited FDA approval of Pfizer booster shots
Date: Fri 17 Sept 2021

Federal vaccine advisors today [17 Sep 2021] approved a 3rd booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine on an emergency use basis, but only for the most vulnerable groups, which include those age 65 and older and people at high risk of severe disease.

The final vote passed unanimously on an 18 to 0 vote. An initial vote on broader 3rd doses in those age 16 and older failed 16 to 2, based on questions about safety and whether 3rd doses would do much to decrease transmission.

The nonbinding decision from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) will influence how the White House rolls out booster doses next week, part of stepped-up efforts to tamp down the nation's delta (B1617.2) variant surge.

The booster dose would be given 6 months after receiving the 2nd dose. In the middle of August [2021], federal health officials approved a 3rd dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people who are moderately or severely immunocompromised. Some developed countries such as Israel and the United Kingdom have already launched 3rd doses across broad parts of their populations.

VRBPAC made its decision in a high-pressure setting, not only due to White House policy issues, but also from international efforts to push high-income countries to delay booster doses as a way to free up more supply for developing countries.

At the start of today's meeting [17 Sep 2021], however, Peter Marks, MD, PhD, who directs the FDA's Center for Biologics and Research, encouraged the group to hold a vigorous scientific debate, but pressed them to focus on Pfizer's booster dose application and not US policy and global equity implications.

The group's discussion also came in the midst of a spate of new data this week on waning immunity and booster doses, especially a large study in Israel that found that a 3rd dose substantially reduced COVID-19 cases and severe illness in those ages 60 and older.

Yesterday [16 Sep 2021] in materials released in advance of the meeting, the FDA's own analysis said some observational studies found waning protection after 2 doses, while others did not, and that US licensed or authorized vaccines still show strong protection against severe disease and death. Ahead of the meeting, new data from Pfizer suggested protection waned 6% every 2 months, offering limited protection at 6 to 8 months.

At the start of the group's main debate today [17 Sep 2021], Marks said VRBPAC is asked to weigh "complex data that is evolving in front of our eyes." He urged the group to fully consider the Israeli data and noted that 3rd doses are recommended for some other infectious diseases to mount a mature immune response.

Some of the group's hesitation today circled around lack of full safety data for a 3rd dose, given questions about rare reports of myocarditis in males ages 16 to 29.

Several experts weren't comfortable extrapolating safety data from older people to younger age groups. They also wrestled with whether a booster could help reduce transmission, especially given the more transmissible delta variant and when considering groups that are vulnerable, such as children that can't yet be vaccinated and older people.

In narrowing the voting question after the 1st vote failed, some members said people at occupational risk, such as healthcare workers should be included. Arnold Monto, MD, VRBPAC's acting chair, said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisors could fine-tune recommendations when they meet next week. Marks also signaled that FDA officials could tweak VRBPAC's recommendation.

FDA officials will make a final decision, which is expected to come soon. The FDA often follows the recommendations of VRBPAC, which is made up of outside experts.

Following the FDA's final decision, CDC vaccine advisors meeting next week will consider recommending the booster.

If the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) green-lights the recommendation at its meeting next week and the CDC accepts the recommendation, booster vaccination campaigns using the Pfizer vaccine can begin.

[The FDA advisory panel's recommendation to limit approval of a 3rd, booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to persons older than 65 years is not unexpected and in accordance with the principle to fully consider, but not go beyond, currently available data. The group clearly complied with Dr. Marks's guidance to take into account the results of the recent Israeli booster dose study (covered in ProMED COVID-19 Update (319)), which showed that a 3rd dose significantly reduced COVID-19 cases and severe illness in people older than 60 years of age. - Mod.LXL]

The health directorate yesterday [16 Sep 2021] reported a 5.98% COVID positivity rate, which is the lowest in more than 6 months. On 11 Mar 2021, the positivity rate was 5.82%. Since then, it started rising and reached the all-time highest -- 33% -- on 24 Jul 2021.

Positivity rate is one of the important parameters to measure the level of virus transmission. The World Health Organization recommends easing virus curb restrictions when the positivity rate remains below 5% for 2 weeks at a stretch.

The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) yesterday [16 Sep 2021] reported 1862 confirmed cases of COVID-19 after testing 31 149 samples across the country. With this, the total number of cases rose to 1 538 203.

As the number of cases continued declining every day, most beds in the COVID-dedicated hospitals have been going vacant. Yesterday [16 Sep 2021], over 83% of all general beds, 61% of all beds in the high dependency units, and 70% of beds in intensive care units were vacant, according to the DGHS data.

In 24 hours until 8:00 am yesterday [16 Sep 2021], DGHS confirmed 51 deaths from COVID-19, taking the total number of patients to 27 109.

The death rate was 1.76%. Of yesterday's [16 Sep 2021] deceased, 25 were men and 26 women. The highest, 29, died in Khulna division, 8 in Chattogram, 6 in Khulna, 4 in Rajshahi, 3 in Barishal, and one in Rangpur divisions.

https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/covid-kerala-posts-20k-cases-again-india-tally-at-35k/articleshow/86280532.cms


Kerala has reported more than 20 000 fresh cases of COVID-19 for the 1st time in 4 days, taking India's daily tally to a 6-day high of just under 35 000 on Thursday [16 Sep 2021].

India reported 34 671 new cases of the coronavirus (with Tripura's data not received until midnight), the highest daily tally since 37 868 infections were detected last Friday [10 Sep 2021], as per TOI's COVID database. Kerala's cases rose to 22 182, up from 17 681 on the previous day. The state had last reported 20 000-plus daily cases on Sunday [12 Sep 2021].

Despite Thursday's spurt [16 Sep 2021], Kerala's 7-day average of daily cases continued to decline, falling below 20 000 to 19 505. This indicates that cases in the state are still dipping.

Meanwhile, Mizoram reported 1402 new cases, the 3rd-highest daily count recorded in the state that is in the midst of a surge in infections.

India recorded 318 deaths on Thursday [16 Sep 2021], down from 375 on the previous day. Kerala reported 178 deaths, Maharashtra 45, Tamil Nadu 25, Karnataka 18, and Andhra [Pradesh] 14.

https://www.dawn.com/news/1646222/country-reports-less-than-3000-cases-after-50-days


While the country reported less than 3000 COVID-19 cases after a gap of 50 days, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr. Faisal Sultan on Monday [13 Sep 2021] claimed that Pakistan was performing well in terms of vaccination. However, he said the pandemic was very much there so the citizens should continue wearing masks as it was one of the best preventions against the virus.

According to the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) data, 2988 cases were reported and 67 people lost their battle against the virus in a single day across the country. Earlier, 2819 cases had been reported on 24 Jul 2021 and since then the daily number of infections had remained over 3000. The highest number of cases was reported on 4 Aug 2021 when 5661 people were found infected.

Meanwhile, taking notice of fake news circulated on social media that educational institutions in Punjab had been closed until 30 Sep 2021, the NCOC said educational institutions in Punjab, Islamabad, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) will remain closed till 15 Sep 2021. Any decision regarding extension in the closure of the institutions will be communicated through official channels, it added.

An official of the Ministry of National Health Services said people should not give heed to such rumours. "The situation of COVID-19 has been improving and probably most educational institutions will open from 16 Sep 2021. In case of rumours, parents are advised to check through authentic sources and do not trust social media," he added.

According to the NCOC data, over 50% of ventilators were occupied in the cities of Multan, Sargodha, and Lahore and more than 60% of oxygenated beds were in use in Sargodha, Multan, Gujrat, and Swabi. The number of active cases was 90 545 on Monday [13 Sep 2021]. The national positivity was 5.62% and 5066 patients were in critical care.

At the inaugural ceremony of a "Wear a Mask -- Protect Pakistan" drive at the World Health Organisation (WHO) office in Islamabad, Dr. Sultan said people should maintain social distance to combat the 4th wave of the pandemic. "I am hopeful that soon the time will come when we will say that you don't need to wear masks. However, currently, you need to take all precautionary measures and wear masks. We also want our institutions to be strengthened so that people would benefit," he said.

Dr. Sultan said Pakistan had dealt with COVID-19 in a better way compared to other countries. "Daily around one million people are being vaccinated and 50 million people have been partially or completely vaccinated to date [14 Sep 2021]. But along with vaccination, I would suggest that people should wear masks," he said.

It may be mentioned that the virus was detected in China in December 2019 and then started spreading to other countries. Pakistan had closed its borders and took a number of steps to check the transmission of the virus.

The 1st case of COVID-19 was reported in the last week of February 2020. On 13 Mar 2020, the 1st meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC), composing top civil and military leadership, was held to discuss the crisis which was later declared a pandemic by WHO.

Prime Minister Imran Khan chaired the meeting of the NSC and directed the concerned authorities to devise a comprehensive strategy against it. The 1st lockdown was announced on 16 Mar 2020, and a number of industries, including the construction industry, educational institutions, restaurants, and marriage halls, were closed.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was involved to ensure medical equipment and health-related supplies at the earliest due to which the coordination with the provinces improved. To date [14 Sep 2021], 4 waves of COVID-19 have been declared.

Meanwhile, in the federal capital, 2 deaths and 246 new cases of the virus were reported on Monday [13 Sep 2021]. One of the deceased was a male in the age group of 70-79 and the other a female who was aged between 80 and 89 years. They were residents of G-7 and G-8.

In the last 24 hours, 4103 tests were conducted out of which 136 males and 110 females tested positive with a 5.99% positivity rate. Officials said 60 cases were reported in the age-group of 30-39, 49 in 0-9, 41 in 20-29, 28 in 40-49, 25 in 50-59, 19 in 10-19, 14 in 60-69, 7 in 70-79, and 3 in 80 and above.

They said 12 cases were reported from Loi Bher; 10 from Bhara Kahu; 8 each from F-10, Sohan, and Koral; 7 each from G-10, G-7, G-11, F-6, and F-7; 6 each from G-9, Rawat, G-6, I-8, E-11, G-8, I-9, F-8, and Alipur; 5 each from Tarlai and Chak Shahzad; 4 from F-11; 3 each from I-10, G-13, Model Town, and E-16; 2 each from Khanna, G-5, Chirrah, D-12, and I-12; and one each from Rawal Town, G-15, Kirpa, G-14, Sihala, I-11, H-12, I-14, F-17, and Gokina.

The number of present daily COVID-19 cases which ranges around 2300 is still unbearable to the health system, Deputy Director General of Health Services Dr. Hemantha Herath said today [16 Sep 2021]. He told the media that the number of patients reported daily requires to reduce further if the country is to feel comfortable.

"There was a time where zero COVID cases were reported within the country, but only the overseas returnees were added to the daily count," he said. "There was also a time where only 100 to 200 cases had been reported in the country. We need to reach either of these situations in order to embrace normalcy," Dr. Herath added.

He said it is the people who would have to decide whether to reach a satisfactory level by getting vaccinated and following health rules.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 17 Sep 2021 at 03:24 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 33 380 522 / 444 278 / 318
Bangladesh: 1 538 203 / 27 109 / 163
Pakistan: 1 215 821 / 27 004 / 119
Nepal: 781 989 / 11 002 / 370
Sri Lanka: 498 694 / 11 817 /549
Afghanistan: 154 487 / 7186 / 180
Maldives: 83 248 / 227 / 411
Bhutan: 2596 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 217 518, 13 313, 21 623, 7402, 21 058, and 525 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, respectively, compared with 259 715, 17 774, 22 620, 8673, 29 879, and 587 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a downward trend in India, the continuation of the sharp declining trend in Bangladesh, a slightly decreasing trend in Pakistan, a decreasing trend in Nepal, a sharp decreasing trend in Sri Lanka and a stable trend in Afghanistan with a very low number of reported cases.

Live Situational Analysis on COVID-19 cases in Sri Lanka can be seen at https://hpb.health.gov.lk/covid19-dashboard/. After a plateau over the last 2 weeks or so, the curve of the disease in Sri Lanka has seemingly started to fall sharply. This could be the effect of the country-wide lockdown, initially imposed from the night of 20 Aug 2021 to 30 Aug 2021, which has been extended in 3 phases until 21 Sep 2021 (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/sri-lanka-extends-covid-19-lockdown-till-september-21/articleshow/86095119.cms). Because the daily reported cases are still very high to be managed clinically despite a sharp decreasing trend, the Association of Medical Specialists (AMS) in the country urged the Government to further extend the lockdown until the beginning of October (2021) (https://www.dailymirror.lk/latest_news/Health-experts-urge-Govt-to-extend-lockdown-further/342-220519). The total number of deaths associated with the disease has crossed the milestone of 11 000 in the country, and the number of the reported deaths per million population attributed to COVID-19 remains the highest in Sri Lanka compared with any other South Asian countries. However, the country has reportedly completed vaccinating over 50% of the population with 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccines (http://www.news.cn/english/2021-09/15/c_1310189735.htm).

Because daily case positivity in Pakistan is still quite high, below 6% (5.6%), as indicated in item [D] above, a slight dip in weekly reported cases over the course of the last 2 weeks or so should still be cautiously interpreted because any substantial relaxation in the personal protective measures such as mask-wearing, maintaining physical distancing, and handwashing would escalate the situation in the near future due to the ongoing spread of the delta variant. According to the data as of 14 Sep 2021, a total of 70 494 348 vaccine doses have been administered in the country (https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk).

The daily-case positivity and number of deaths associated with COVID-19 are dropping steadily in Bangladesh. The current case positivity rate is now just below 6% (5.98%), around 3% lower compared to the rate observed in the preceding week which is also the lowest in more than the last 6 months, as indicated in item [A] above. As the new cases were falling sharply, the country decided to reopen schools and colleges from 12 Sep 2021 with maintaining guidelines and health protocols (https://m.theindependentbd.com/post/267954). Bangladesh has a plan of vaccinating 80% population above the age of 18 years. So far, of the target population, only 18% have received the 1st dose and 12% have received both 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

India reported a steady fall of new cases over the last 2 weeks after showing an alarming sign of an increasing trend over the preceding 2 weeks. As the number of new cases is falling in Kerala state, the total country-wide count is also showing a significant decreasing trend. Out of 36 States and Union Territories in the country, 19 including Kerala are now showing a decreasing trend of new cases, according to the counts as of 17 Sep 2021 at 08:00 IST compared to the counts in the previous 24 hours (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). As of 17 Sep 2021, at 8.00 AM IST, 772 425 744 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in India (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).
