More cases of mysterious kidney ailment reported
-------------------------------------------------
Doctors identified new victims of a potentially fatal kidney
condition Thu, 24 Mar 2005 while health investigators focused on a
strain of dangerous bacteria as the possible cause of their
illnesses. 2 more people in Central Florida were diagnosed with the
rare ailment called HUS, or hemolytic uremic syndrome, which attacks
and shuts down the kidneys.
The Florida Department of Health also was investigating another case
in Wisconsin involving a child who recently visited the Orlando area.
The Wisconsin child brought the total number of confirmed illnesses
to 9. In addition, 2 Central Florida patients were hospitalized with
suspected cases. 8 of the 9 confirmed cases are in children.
Health officials fanned out with a renewed sense of urgency, testing
farm animals that might have spread the bacteria that often cause the
kidney ailment. The animals were at 2 events from 3-13 Mar 2005: the
Central Florida Fair in Orlando and the Florida Strawberry Festival
in Plant City.
Investigators are most interested in the calves, goats and other
animals that were used in petting zoos, where many of the children
visited. "We're focusing on where there was close contact with
children and animals," said Thomas Holt, state veterinarian with the
Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.
6 children remained very ill at hospitals in Orlando -- 5 in critical
condition and one listed as serious. Doctors said 4 of the children
have deteriorated to the point of requiring dialysis to augment their
failed kidneys. 1 sick child at Florida Hospital Orlando was
improving and may be well enough to go home soon.
In other developments Thu, 24 Mar 2005:
The outbreak had its 1st confirmed case of HUS in an adult, who was
in serious condition. Health officials couldn't say if the person had
been to one of the fairs.
Test results for one of the ill children came back positive for
_Escherichia coli_ - labeled _E. coli_ O157:H7. This bacteria has
been linked to the HUS kidney ailment in previous outbreaks in other
states.
The CDC released guidelines advising states how to protect the public
at petting zoos and other events where farm animals are exhibited.
The recommendations are voluntary, and the CDC said the timing of the
advisory had nothing to do with the spate of illnesses in Florida.
The guidelines have been in the works for several years, as health
officials noticed an increasing number of disease-related outbreaks
linked to farm animals at public events.
The CDC counts about 25 such incidents stemming back to 1990 in
states from Washington to Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
In Florida, health officials said they are looking at a number of
possible causes, including sources beyond the animals. For example,
the state has begun interviewing food vendors from the 2 fairs to see
if contaminated food or beverages might be involved, said Joann
Schulte, a medical epidemiologist with the Florida Department of
Health in Tallahassee. She said tests are ongoing to determine if
other patients also have the dangerous strain of _E. coli_.
However, Schulte said, it is possible that other patients might test
negative for _E. coli_ even if they have been exposed to it. That is
because the bacteria might have passed through their systems
completely during the 1st few days of symptoms, which include severe
diarrhea. At the same time, the state also is testing the animals
for this strain. Results are expected in 2 or 3 days.
As part of their rounds Thu, 24 Mar 2005, state veterinarians visited
Ag-Venture Farm Shows in Plant City, which had animals at both the
Central Florida Fair and the Florida Strawberry Festival. "We're
cooperating in any way we can," said owner Tom Umiker, whose family
has been running its farm-education program for about 10 years. They
take cows, sheep and goats to the events. He said Ag-Venture works
about 15 fairs a year around the country, going as far as Detroit,
New York and Maine, as well as the Florida State Fair last month in
Tampa, he said.
Umiker said the owners of animal exhibits rely on the fairgrounds to
provide hand washing and sanitizing areas, though they also sell hand
wipes. Umiker has noticed improvement in recent years in the number
of signs urging safe practices and hand-washing stations available at
fairs around the country. "I think you're going to see more of that
at public events," he said.
Florida has no law regulating petting zoos. Some states such as
Pennsylvania passed laws after similar outbreaks, said Minnesota
veterinarian Jeff Bender, who helped write the CDC guidelines that
came out Thu, 24 Mar 2005. For example, Pennsylvania requires
petting zoos and other animal exhibitions to provide hand-washing
facilities. The law, passed in 2002, also requires them to inform the
public about the types of diseases that animals can pass on to
humans, according the Humane Society of the United States.
Bender said the risks are reduced greatly by such common-sense
practices as washing hands thoroughly and not eating food while in
close contact with the animals. "It's in the best interest of these
petting zoos to minimize these events, and it's entirely possible
with some basic measures and proper supervision," said Bender, a
professor in veterinary public health at the University of Minnesota.
The CDC's recommendations include: Posting signs that warn visitors
they are entering an animal area and advise them to wash their hands
before leaving; having enough hand-washing stations available and
making certain they are child-friendly in size and ease of operation;
and managing the flow of people through the exhibits.

In the discussion about the HUS cases in Florida associated with the
petting zoos, I didn't see any mention of Q fever as a possible
agent, depending on symptoms (which weren't mentioned in the news
articles).
[Following is a reference and abstract regarding Q fever:]
Maltezou HC, Kallergi C, Kavazarakis E, Stabouli S, Kafetzis
DA.Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with Coxiella burnetii
infection.Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2001; 20:811-13.
Abstract: Acute Q fever most commonly manifests as a self-limited
febrile illness, pneumonia or hepatitis. We report the case of a
12-year-old child with documented exposure to sources of _Coxiella
burnetii_ who was admitted to our hospital because of
hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Serologic tests established the diagnosis
of acute Q fever.

[One of the affected children has now been found to have _E. coli_
O157:H7, in the stool presumably, although it can be found in the
urine as well. Little has been said regarding whether diarrhea --
especially bloody diarrhea -- was present in these patients or others
with similar exposures. This is likely to be the case, since the
risk of HUS developing after _E. coli_ O157:H7 is not thought to be
more than 15 percent (in children less than 10 years old, the highest
risk group).
Typically HUS develops after 5 to 13 days of illness with the onset
of diarrhea being day 1. Although sometimes prolonged, the usual
incubation period of _E. coli_ O157:H7 diarrhea after exposure is 3-4
days (1). The gastrointestinal illness is usually quite prominent,
but HUS has been reported in patients with asymptomatic infection
with the organism (2, 3). Post-illness shedding of O157:H7 can be
prolonged, contributing to secondary cases, but it is probable that
transmissibility is greatest during the initial diarrheal phase (4).
The CDC publication mentioned in the 1st posting is CDC: Compendium
of measures to prevent disease associated with animals in public
settings, 2005. Morbid Mortal Week Rep 2005; 54 (RR-4):1-13.

ProMED thanks Dr. Gillis for her comment regarding Q fever. Although
a number of infections have been linked to HUS, it would be quite
uncommon to see an outbreak like this due to anything but _E. coli_
O157:H7 -- but now we find out that at least one case has been
confirmed with O157:H7.
