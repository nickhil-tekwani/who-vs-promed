Since January 2000, the Ministry of Health has stepped up the yellow fever
vaccination programme to include all cities and municipalities in the North
and Central-West of Brazil, in response to a rise in the number of cases of
yellow fever in these regions. Twenty-three cases of yellow fever have been
identified, with 9 deaths -- the majority occurring in the state of Goias.
The city of Campinas, where the vaccination programme was started on 5 Feb
2000, has reported only one case in a traveler from the state of Goias.
Almost 5 million doses of vaccine have been made available for use in
Campinas and the surrounding municipalities. Campinas is located
approximately 100 kilometers outside of Sao Paulo.
The vaccine, which is a live, weakened virus, is manufactured by the
Oswaldo Cruz Foundation based in Rio. The vaccie is distributed free of
charge by the Ministry of Health, and is recommended for all individuals,
particularly travelers to and from endemic regions. The vaccine is not
recommended for pregnant women and those with weakened immune systems [e.g.
HIV carriers; nor for infants under 9 months of age - Mod. JW.
