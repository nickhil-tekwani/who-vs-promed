Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) in children in Kerala
-----------------------------------------------
In the absence of systematic and comprehensive disease surveillance
in the various states of India, we learn about outbreaks only from
newspapers. Obviously only newsworthy outbreaks are reported.
According to this newspaper report, some 200 children with HFMD have
been seen in one hospital in Kozhikode (previously Calicut) by one
pediatrician during the past several months. No virological study was
reported, even though the hospital concerned is a part of the local
Calicut Medical Colllege.
Since there was no mention of death, I would surmise that there was
none. Therefore, it is unlikely that the cause is Human enterovirus
71, which may cause large outbreaks of HFMD, neurological diseases
and some mortality. Causes of benign HFMD are Coxsackievirus A16 or
any of the other enteroviruses that may cause HFMD, namely, Human
coxsackieviruses A4, A5, A9, A10, B2 & B5.

The report by R. Madhavan Nair in The Hindu newspaper which is the
subject of Professor T. Jacob John's comment, is reproduced below:
"India: Increasing incidence of hand-foot-and-mouth disease in [Kerala] state
-----------------------------------------------
The outbreak of chikungunya has brought into focus the serious threat
to public health from a number of other potential epidemics. Besides
dengue fever, typhoid and rat fever [leptospirosis? - Mod.JW] --
which have claimed many lives in recent years -- doctors are now
seriously worried about the rising incidence of another infection,
known as hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). The disease has been
diagnosed among children over the last 2 years in Kozhikode and a few
other places in the state. C.K. Sasidharan, former professor,
Kozhikode Medical College, and a senior pediatrician, alone has
registered over 200 cases since 2005. He says the tests on blood
samples he had sent to the National Institute of Communicable
Diseases in Delhi have confirmed the presence of HFMD, a disease
characterized by eruptions on the palms, soles of the feet, buttocks,
knees and elbows of children. The patients had responded quickly to
treatment when 1st reported in Toronto, Canada. But later, it became
a worrisome factor. It became a killer epidemic in Singapore. Dr.
Sasidharan says that in the past 2 years, the HFMD virus found in
Kozhikode and a few other places has become more virulent.
"As the disease has been detected mostly among well-water users,
doctors say immediate action should be taken to prevent the disease
from assuming the proportions of an epidemic, considering that the
number of well-water users is very high in the state... Senior
doctors point out that such a situation would not have arisen had
enough government doctors been sent for in-service training to tackle
epidemics. Doctors say a system whereby anganwadi* workers report to
their superiors the unusual health problems noticed in their
jurisdiction has not been functioning effectively in recent times.
When this system was active, any unusual health-related event was
reported at monthly meetings chaired by the District Medical
Officer." - Mod.CP]

nutrition and child development. - Google
