Mother to child transmission of hepatitis C virus during labour
---------------------------------------------------------------
The overall risk of vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the
United Kingdom (UK) and Ireland is 6.7%, according to a cohort study
reported in the Lancet last week. The risk is higher for children of
mothers co-infected with HIV (odds ratio 3.8) and for children delivered
vaginally or by emergency caesarean section than by elective caesarean
section, but breast feeding appears not to affect the transmission rate.
The study used data from 441 pairs of HCV infected mothers and their
children - 214 in the Republic of Ireland (collected from January 1994 to
April 1999) and 227 from the UK (collected from March 1997 to April 1999).
The timing of antibody tests and uncertainty about the sensitivity of HCV
RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) made definitive diagnosis or exclusion
of HCV infection impossible for most children. The probability of infection
for each child was estimated from the rate of loss of antibody to HCV and
the sensitivity and specificity of HCV RNA PCR. Seventy-eight per cent of
women (343) were reported to have acquired HCV through injecting drug use,
7% (33) through infected blood or blood products, and 15% (65) through
other or unknown routes. Their average age was 27 years; 28 were non-white;
and 22 were known to be co-infected with HIV (HIV status was unknown for
91). 135 of the 144 children who became anti-HCV negative had no
virological evidence of infection. 248 of the remaining 297 children had at
least one RNA PCR test: this was positive in 6 of the 156 children tested
once, a further 8 were consistently positive, 71 were consistently
negative, and 13 had discordant results. An estimated 50% of uninfected
children became seronegative by 8 months of age, with only 5% having
detectable anti-HCV at 13 months.
The authors conclude that testing neonates is of little value, since the
sensitivity of HCV RNA PCR was only 22% in the first month of life but rose
swiftly then to reach 97%. They suggest that a negative RNA PCR test after
1 month of age almost certainly rules out infection, but say that a
positive PCR test leads to a revised risk of 73% and should prompt further
testing. They recommend delaying confirmatory serological testing until 12
to 15 months to avoid detecting maternal antibody. They call for further
studies to assess the apparent protective effect of elective caesarean
section.
