Belgian Authorities to Close More Farms
-----------------------------------------------
Belgian authorities have decided to temporarily close more farms,
after they found traces of a carcinogenic chemical in animal feed,
authorities said Monday [30 Jan 2006]. The food safety agency closed
96 pig and chicken farms on Friday [27 Jan 2006], as it traced the
source of dioxins found by a Dutch firm last week back to a vat of
Belgian pork fat. The fat is mixed with other feed for the livestock industry.
Over the weekend [28-29 Jan 2006], it became clear that more feed
might be affected, and the authorities planned to close an
undisclosed number of additional farms that could have used it,
Pascal Hoebaert of the food safety agency told VRT network. 7 years
ago, a dioxin crisis led to the slaughter of millions of chickens and
thousands of pigs in Belgium.
The agency said levels of contamination were far below the levels
found in 1999, when dioxins entered the human food chain through
contaminated animal feed. Dioxin accumulates in the body and has been
linked to cancer, birth defects and organ failure.

Belgium quarantines 400 farms in dioxin probe
-----------------------------------------------
Belgian food safety officials have quarantined about 400 pig and
chicken farms as they search for animals contaminated by the
cancer-causing chemical dioxin found in their feed.
The country's food safety agency, known as AFSCA, said on Monday [30
Jan 2006] it might have to put more farms under surveillance and test
their animals for traces of the toxic chemical. It said the dioxin
got into one of the ingredients used to make animal feed in October 2005.
Although meat from contaminated animals might have gone to market,
the levels of dioxin were so low that the toxic chemical did not pose
a health risk, it said. "We do not believe that there is a threat to
consumption," said the agency's spokesman, Pascal Houbaert. "There is
no immediate danger."
South Korea banned the import of pork from Belgium and the
Netherlands last week when news of the dioxin 1st broke. The
Netherlands, one of the world's top meat exporters, has quarantined
more than 200 businesses that had received the feed.
The European Commission said it was satisfied with the quick reaction
of the Belgian and Dutch authorities.
The Belgian food safety agency said the dioxin came from the use of
an unfiltered ingredient to extract pig fat from the process of
making gelatin at PB Gelatins, a unit of Tessenderlo, a Belgian
chemical company. The extracted fat was later distributed to animal
feed producers such as Leroy and Algoet, it said. Tessenderlo said it
was taking measures to ensure the contamination did not happen again.
Houbaert said the dioxin was no longer present in subsequent batches
of extracted fat at PB Gelatins. "They have no more contaminated feed."
The level of toxicity equivalent, or TEQ, in the contaminated fat was
400 picograms per one gram of fat, he said. The maximum acceptable
level is 2 picograms. A picogram is one trillionth of a gram.
Dioxins are one of a number of toxic chemicals that originate in
pesticides or industrial processes. They get into rivers and lakes
and build up in the flesh of fish and animals.

[Indeed, for Belgium this must feel like deja-vu. Likewise, the
international community is responding in a predictable fashion, as
they did in 1999.
The health risk to animals and to people is extremely low, and
clearly the precautions are being taken out of an abundance of caution.
Although the dioxin level is extremely low, generally, where there
are dioxins, there are also polychlorinatedbiphenyls (PCBs). I wonder
whether there has been any testing for PCB.
Seveso, Italy has had one of the highest documented levels of dioxin
in human exposure, as such:
1. The tragic unintentional exposure in 1976 in Italy resulted "in
the highest levels of the toxicant ever recorded in humans" (ref 1).
Some "serum 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) levels in
residents of the contaminated zones in Seveso, Italy, in 1976, ...
are among the highest ever reported, and thus this population serves
as a benchmark for comparison of human exposure and potential adverse
health effects" (ref 2). 20 years after the exposure, the geometric
mean plasma TCDD level among those most exposed was 53.2 ppt (parts
per trillion), whereas the level in non-exposed persons was 4.9 ppt (ref 1).
2. A study of cancer mortality from 1976-1991 among residents of
Seveso "found no increase for all-cancer mortality or major specific
sites (for example, respiratory among males, breast among females)."
The investigators did find excesses in cancers of some specific sites
when subjects were stratified by sex, but there was no clear dose
effect, and they concluded only that "the specific excesses that we
observed were not explained by bias or confounding, and their
association with dioxin exposure is plausible" (ref 3). A review
published in 1998 concluded that "chloracne...was the only [early]
effect established with certainty" and that although long-term
studies uncovered excesses in cardiovascular mortality, respiratory
diseases, diabetes, cancer of gastrointestinal sites and of the
lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue, "results cannot be viewed as
conclusive" (ref 4).
3. Although there seems to be no doubt in the lay press about
dioxin's status as a carcinogen, there seems to be some controversy
in the toxicology literature (ref 5).
