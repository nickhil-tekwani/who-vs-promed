For the 1st time in Butte County, the mosquito commonly known as the yellow fever mosquito has been found. The invasive species was discovered 17 Sep [2020] in northeast Chico in the area of East Avenue and Mariposa Avenue.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito has been detected previously in other areas of California, but never in Butte County. _Ae. aegypti_ have the potential to transmit viruses such as chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, which are not known to be transmitted by Butte County's native mosquitoes and to date have not been detected in _Ae. aegypti_ in California.

"The district is working to evaluate the extent of the infestation, and we plan to do everything we can to eradicate this mosquito and to protect our residents from the potential disease risk of these invasive mosquitoes," said Matt Ball, District Manager. "Our goal is to control and eliminate this species of mosquito so that it does not become established in our community."

The same invasive species was detected in Shasta County in August [2020].

To prevent an increase in mosquitoes, make sure to drain any standing water from your property.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to increase their geographic range in California. Now Butte County is added to 2 recent new locations, Ventura and Yolo counties. Shasta and San Joaquin counties were added earlier this year (2020). _Ae. aegypti_ mosquitoes have been detected in an increasing number of California localities over the past 4 years. Although the above report points out that the probability of introduction of any of these mentioned viruses with ongoing transmission is unlikely, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito in the localities where they have recently been found as quickly as possible is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
