Outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections linked to pre-cut melons
------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the US Food and Drug Administration are investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella_ Carrau infections.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by the CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on _Salmonella_ bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. WGS showed that isolates from ill people were closely relatedly genetically. This means that people in this outbreak are more likely to share a common source of infection.

The multistate investigation began on 2 Apr 2019, when PulseNet identified the outbreak. As of 24 Apr 2019, 117 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Carrau have been reported from 10 states.

State / Ill people
Alabama / 1
Iowa / 1
Illinois / 7
Indiana / 23
Kentucky / 21
Michigan / 22
Minnesota / 3
Missouri / 7
Ohio / 31
Wisconsin / 1
---------------
Total / 117

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 4 Mar 2019 to 8 Apr 2019. Ill people range in age from less than 1 to 98 years, with a median age of 53 years; 58% are female. Of 88 people with information available, 32 (36%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Illnesses might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 4 weeks. Please see the Timeline for Reporting Cases of _Salmonella_ Infection for more details (https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/reporting-timeline.html).

Investigation of the outbreak
---------------------------
Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicate that pre-cut melon supplied by Caito Foods LLC of Indianapolis, Indiana, is the likely source of this multistate outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 63 people interviewed, 46 (73%) reported eating pre-cut melons purchased at grocery stores, including pre-cut cantaloupe, watermelon, honeydew, or a fruit salad mix or fruit tray with melon. Five additional people reported eating pre-cut melon outside the home.

Information collected from stores where ill people shopped indicates that Caito Foods LLC supplied pre-cut melon to these stores. On 12 Apr 2019, Caito Foods, Inc. recalled pre-cut watermelon, honeydew melon, cantaloupe, and pre-cut fruit medley products containing one of these melons produced at the Caito Foods LLC facility in Indianapolis, Indiana.

This investigation is ongoing, and the CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[This ongoing outbreak is associated with pre-cut fruit of various kinds, not just one. Pre-cutting the fruit allows the pathogen to be introduced into the edible portion of the food. That a number of melons are involved might suggest that the contamination occurred after harvesting or that field contamination was to a number of different crops. - Mod.LL
