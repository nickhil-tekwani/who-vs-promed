[The patient who died is from Afghanistan. It is not clear whether the other 2 patients are also from there or are from Pakistan. CCHF virus is endemic in both countries. Interestingly, there were 2 other cases of CCHF infection acquired in Afghanistan who sought medical attention in Pakistan in 2015 and another in 2014. Cases of CCHF occurred in Sindh province, Pakistan this year (2015) and in various parts of Pakistan last year (2014).

Circumstances under which these patients acquired their CCHF virus infections are not stated in the above report. They probably acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 percent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.

Hayatabad is a suburb of Peshawar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and is adjacent to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. A map showing the location of Peshawar in Pakistan can be found at the above URL.
