First Report of Sugarcane yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) in Costa Rica
----------------------------------------------------------------

Investigacion en Biologia Celular y Molecular (CIBCM), Universidad de Costa
Rica (UCR), E. Chavarria, LAICA-DIECA, Costa Rica, B. E. L. Lockhart,
Department of Plant Pathology, University of Minnesota, and C. Rivera,
CIBCM and Facultad de Microbiologia, UCR. Plant Dis. 85:919, 2001;
published on-line as D-2001-0529-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication 20 Mar
2001.
In Costa Rica, sugarcane plants with symptoms similar to those described
for yellow leaf syndrome (YLS) (1,2) were first observed in 1994 in
research plots of imported material in the midland areas of San Carlos and
Turrialba. Recently, the same symptoms [recurred] in commercial plantations
in Turrialba.
Symptomatic plants were characterized by yellowing of the leaves and
central veins,...yellowing being more intense near the leaf tips. In severe
cases, veins became reddish, and necrosis developed along the leaf edges,
beginning at the leaf tip and extending to the base of the leaf. Growth of
stems and roots was also reduced in infected plants.
Mini-purifications of 6 plants of 4 different varieties were examined
by...(ISEM) using polyclonal antibodies (1). They were: 1 symptomatic plant
each of...H782313 and H608521; 2 symptomatic plants of H657052, and 1
asymptomatic plant each of H608521 and H827318. Isometric particles [ca.]
28 nm were observed in the asymptomatic H827318 plant and in all
symptomatic plants, with the exception of 1 plant of H657052. The size and
morphology of the particles [were] similar to those reported for Sugarcane
yellow leaf virus (ScYLV) (2).
The presence of ScYLV was verified by indirect...(ELISA) using polyclonal
antibodies (1). 22...of 24 symptomatic plants and 5 of 13 asymptomatic
plants were positive for ScYLV...the association of ScYLV with the yellows
syndrome of sugarcane observed in Costa Rica [is confirmed]. However, as
was also reported by [others]...(1), ScYLV was not detected in several
symptomatic plants, and research is continuing to determine whether other
pathogens are associated with this syndrome in Costa Rica.

[ScYLV is a Polerovirus in the Luteoviridae family. The virus is
transmitted by only a few aphid species. It is not transmitted by seed.
Yellow leaf syndrome (YLS) occurs on sugarcane in a number of countries
(Brazil, French West Indies, Hawaii, Peru, Cuba, Morocco, USA, Mauritius,
Reunion, and South Africa) and perhaps elsewhere. Depending upon the
susceptibility of sugarcane cultivars, the disease can cause severe crop
losses. The South African disease is associated with a phytoplasma in
ScYLV-free plants, suggesting that YLS may be a general response to more
than one type of pathogen or stress factor. Indeed, as Scagliusi and
Lockhart point out, abiotic factors such as soil compaction, nutrient
imbalance, waterlogging and others induce symptoms similar to YLS. In
Brazil, YLS caused crop losses of 50 percent in the cultivar SP 71-6163.
Resistance to YLS has been identified in Hawaii cultivars. - Mod.DH]
