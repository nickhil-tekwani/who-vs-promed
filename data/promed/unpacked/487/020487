WHY I SUBSCRIBE TO ProMED-mail: DEBORA MacKENZIE
*************************************************
As a reporter for an international magazine of science and technology,
I am addicted to my daily fix of news on ProMED-mail. It has alerted
me to dozens of important stories our readers would not otherwise have
seen.
More important, ProMED-mail is helping to end secrecy and cover-up in
international epidemiological reporting -- to read why on the Web, go
to:
http://www.newscientist.com/ns/19990206/forum.html
and click on the Forum section of the 6 February edition.
