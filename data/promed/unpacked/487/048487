ANTHRAX, HORSE - TAIWAN

Taiwan temporarily shut down a riding club on Tuesday after a horse died of
the anthrax virus, (sic) sparking a scare that was fanned by alarmist
headlines.
Authorities ordered quarantine offices to test the blood of all horses and
workers at Taiwan's 38 stables, but also appealed for calm, saying the
disease, though potentially fatal to humans, was isolated and posed no
immediate threat.
"So far, only one horse at Taipei's Plum Flower Horse Riding Club was found
to have been attacked by the virus and died on November 23," said a
spokesman for the quarantine department, a unit of the cabinet's Council of
Agriculture. Officials said the horse that died was from southern Taiwan,
but apparently contracted the disease at the Taipei stable.
The official said blood tests of all 33 horses and some 40 people
associated with the stable, including workers, riders and quarantine
inspectors, showed no signs of infection.
Farm and health officials said anthrax, which attacks grazing horses,
cattle, sheep and other grazing animals, had not been detected in Taiwan
since 1942.

[It would interesting to know what this Reuters journalist was referring to
by writing that 33 horses and 40 people had been blood tested. There is no
readily available diagnostic blood test that I know of other than for
bacteraemias and they are not positive until the clinical signs are
obvious; there are some experimental ELISA tests for Protective Antigen in
the blood but are not in circulation. The Russians have a nice 'Anthracin'
skin test but that is more retrospective than predictive, as one has to
survive long enough to develop the capacity to respond.
There has been no reason at all to doubt the Taiwan decades long claim of
freedom from this disease. And until there is further information on this
outbreak we are very much in the dark and should be cautious of any and all
claims of terrorist activity. One would want to know whether it was
laboratory confirmed; how many other horses may have been ill; was this
horse in an inner stable or near the periphery -- the latter would have
made it a better target for horse flies with contaminated mouthparts; have
the surrounding farms been checked for recent acute deaths in livestock;
has the feed been examined?
While the disease is endemic in China, there was an outbreak in Northern
Luzon earlier this year. Outside of China, we have found that most SE Asian
strains of _B. anthracis_ are related to what we see in Turkey (and thus
Central Asia). If the diagnostic material from this dead horse was kept, we
will gladly PCR fingerprint this culture to determine which strain it is
and possible source(s). Maybe someone from Doctor Watson H.T. Sung's office
or the Taiwan state veterinary service can provide confirmatory information
on this outbreak. - MHJ]
