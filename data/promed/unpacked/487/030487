As Poslovni Dnevnik writes, there has been a significant outbreak of hepatitis in Zagreb and it has been going on for around 2 months now. The largest number of patients at this moment in time are high school students, reports the Jutarnji list [Croatian daily newspaper].

"Since the beginning of March 2022, we have recorded 57 cases of hepatitis A, mostly among high school students. The causative agent is the hepatitis A virus, which is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, that is, by ingesting contaminated water or food in the stool of an infected person or from hands contaminated with the stool of an infected person. The disease was reported among students from 3 schools in Zagreb and their household contacts.

About 45 patients have already recovered. It's possible that in the end, the number of infected people will be higher because the incubation period for hepatitis A is 1 month, in some cases even 2 months,'' said Branko Kolaric, the director of the "Dr Andrija Stampar." Teaching Institute in Zagreb. Although the schools received instructions regarding the spread of the virus that they passed on to both parents and children, Kolaric would like to appeal to everyone to maintain hand hygiene and to keep washing them regularly.

Hepatitis A or contagious jaundice is an acute contagious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus and is most commonly transmitted by unwashed hands, contaminated food or water, and after someone has been in close physical contact with an infected person, including through sexual activity. Incubation lasts 15-50 days, on average about a month. The affected person is contagious 14 days before the onset and 7 days after the onset of symptoms.

"The symptoms of acute hepatitis A include fever, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, light coloured stool, and dark urine. Elevated bilirubin and transaminase levels are then confirmed by performing liver function tests. The disease is often asymptomatic or mild, especially in children under 5 years of age,'' said Lorna Stemberger Maric, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist from the Dr Fran Mihaljevic Clinic for Infectious Diseases. "Currently, we do not have any patients with hepatitis in our department, but in the last month, we have had several serious cases in high school and elementary school. Fortunately, all of our young patients have recovered so far. We've had individual cases of acute hepatitis A in previous years, but I don't remember having such an epidemic that spread among children like this one has,'' added Lorna Stemberger Maric.

In the meantime, the principals of Zagreb's schools received instructions and handed out information leaflets to teachers, parents, and students. It was pointed out that a person can become infected if they eat food prepared by an infected person who did not wash their hands properly or washed them in contaminated water.

Humans can also become infected with Hepatitis A through close contact with a person who has the virus using a shared toilet and kitchen. Another way of contracting the disease is engaging in sexual intercourse with an infected person, and it is especially risky for a man to have sexual intercourse with another infected man.

[With the length of this cluster (at least 2 months) involving primarily high school students, it is possible that a food source at the schools may be present with or without secondary cases. This is a vaccine preventable disease but nothing is stated regarding any vaccine implementation. - Mod.LL
