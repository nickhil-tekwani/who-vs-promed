2nd dairy sheep plant with Q fever
----------------------------------
The Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (VWA) announced that a
dairy sheep farm in Stolwijk, South Holland, has been declared Q-fever
infected. It is the 2nd dairy sheep plant declared infected in the
Netherlands [since 1 Oct 2009]. In January [2010], a dairy sheep farm
in Kraggenburg was found infected.

In addition, another dairy goat farm in Haren, North Brabant, has now
been declared infected. The current total number of Q-fever infected
farms found in the Netherlands [since 1 Oct 2009], is 73 [of which 71
are dairy goat farms].

11 new Q fever patients so far in 2010
--------------------------------------
According to the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the
Environment (RIVM), 136 new human cases of Q fever have been reported
in the country during the current year [2010]. In 11 of the patients,
the onset of disease took place during 2010 and it is assumed that
they had been infected within the previous weeks. The dates of onset
of disease in the other patients are not known, but are considered to
have taken place during 2009 or even earlier. Many people report their
health complaints to their family doctors only now, following the
disease becoming a news item [eventually leading to serological
confirmation. The incubation period for acute Q fever in humans varies
from 2 to 48 days; the typical incubation period is approximately 2 to
3 weeks. Chronic Q fever can occur from months to years after
infection. - Mod.AS]

[An epidemic curve graph, showing the number of reported Dutch Q fever
patients by week of onset for the period 1 Jan 2007-10 Feb 2010, is
available at
<http://www.rivm.nl/cib/binaries/Epicurve%20Q-koorts_tcm92-59728.pdf>.
The cases are presented according to the relevant Community Health
Services (GGD): dark green - "Hart voor Brabant" (NE Brabant); medium
green - SE Brabant; light green - South Limburg; gray - others. The
annual total numbers - 2007: N=194, 2008: N=980, 2009: N=2267, 2010:
N=11.

According to a recent literature search, 53 lab-confirmed outbreaks of
Q fever in humans have been published during the years 1981-2007. The
following 6 countries experienced the largest number of confirmed
outbreaks: Germany (9), France (6), Australia (5), Canada (5), UK (5),
USA (5). The remaining 18 outbreaks were reported from various parts
of the globe. In 26 of the 53 outbreaks, sheep were regarded as source
of infection; goats in 6. Among the other animal sources, cats were
suspected in 3 smaller outbreaks. Larger outbreaks were reported from
East European countries, but lab confirmation was not available.

_C. burnetii_ can infect many species of domestic animals and
wildlife; in many species, the infection appears to be asymptomatic.
Its reservoirs may be only partially known. Sheep, goats, and cattle
seem to be the most common domesticat animal reservoirs. Wild rodents
may be important reservoirs in some areas, and cats -- particularly
following parturition -- are suspected in urban outbreaks. _C.
burnetii_ has also been isolated from dogs, rabbits, horses, pigs,
camels, buffalo, deer, pigeons, swallows, parrots, crows, geese, and
other mammals and birds. Antibodies have been found in coyotes,
raccoons, opossums, badgers, jackrabbits, black bears, musk oxen and
other species. There are also reports of _C. burnetii_ in fish and
snakes. - Mod.AS]
