Norovirus activity: United States, 2006-2007
--------------------------------------------
In late 2006, CDC [US Centers for Disease Control & Prevention] began
receiving requests from numerous state public health departments for
information about a perceived increase in the number of outbreaks of
acute gastroenteritis (AGE), especially those involving
person-to-person transmission in long-term--care facilities. No
national surveillance system exists for AGE outbreaks, including
those caused by norovirus, unless foodborne transmission is
suspected. In the absence of national surveillance data, CDC
attempted to better characterize the outbreaks of AGE by analyzing
information from the following sources: 1) detailed data on recent
AGE outbreaks in 3 of the states that had contacted CDC about a
possible increase (North Carolina, Wisconsin, and New York); 2)
emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance data from Boston,
Massachusetts; 3) basic epidemiologic data on AGE outbreaks from a
CDC survey of state health departments; and 4) laboratory data from
CDC. The analysis suggests that a national increase has occurred in
the frequency of AGE outbreaks caused by norovirus (including fatal
cases in long-term--care facilities). In 2006, 2 new co circulating
GII.4 norovirus strains emerged nationwide and likely accounted for
this increase in activity. Improved national surveillance of
outbreaks, including those with person-to-person transmission;
development of accessible, affordable, and timely clinical tests; and
increased access to a norovirus strain sequencing database at CDC
will lead to more accurate assessment of the morbidity and mortality
associated with norovirus and more rapid identification of newly
emerging norovirus strains.
North Carolina
--------------
During January-December 2006, the North Carolina Division of Public
Health received 17 reports of outbreaks clinically and
epidemiologically consistent with norovirus infection* (1) among
residents of long-term--care facilities, compared with 6 in 2005 and
3 in 2004. Norovirus was confirmed by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in all 12 outbreaks
for which stool specimens were available. A total of 573 residents
and 288 staff members were affected in the 17 outbreaks, and 36
patients required hospitalization. One patient aged 90 years died in
association with an AGE outbreak in a long-term--care facility after
experiencing loose stools, fever, and dehydration for 3 days;
gastrointestinal illness was recorded as the primary cause of death.
Outbreaks lasted from 2 to 35 days (median: 12 days). The largest
confirmed norovirus outbreak at a long-term--care facility affected
77 residents and 67 staff members.
Outbreaks were preceded by illness among food handlers in 4 of the 17
long-term--care facilities, suggesting that these outbreaks might
have been caused initially by foodborne transmission. At least 2
outbreaks were preceded by illness among staff members who also
worked at other long-term--care facilities with reported norovirus
outbreaks. Many long-term--care facilities used disinfectants that
had limited effectiveness against norovirus (such as, quaternary
ammonia compounds) during these outbreaks. Although all AGE and other
communicable disease outbreaks in North Carolina are reportable by
long-term--care facilities to health departments, in at least 4 of
the 17 outbreaks in 2006, health departments were notified of the
outbreaks by emergency medical personnel or residents' family members
rather than directly by the facilities, suggesting incomplete
reporting of these outbreaks by long-term--care facilities in this state.
Wisconsin
---------
During 2006, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health received reports
of 106 AGE outbreaks, compared with 23 AGE outbreaks in 2005. Of the
2006 outbreaks, 87 (82 percent) were PCR-confirmed norovirus
outbreaks; 45 (78 percent) of 58 norovirus-confirmed, non-foodborne
outbreaks were in long-term--care facilities, compared with 3 (20
percent) of the 15 norovirus-confirmed, non-foodborne outbreaks in 2005.
The 45 outbreaks in long-term--care facilities reported in Wisconsin
in 2006 included 2071 clinical cases; 44 patients were hospitalized,
and 2 died. The primary causes of death were not reported. The
duration of outbreaks in long-term--care facilities ranged from 2 to
30 days (median: 11 days). Challenges in investigating these
outbreaks included delayed reporting and incomplete collection of
clinical data by long-term--care facilities.
New York
--------
During 1 Oct 2006-31 Jan 2007, a total of 333 AGE outbreaks were
reported in New York, more than 4 times the number reported during
the same period in 2005-2006 (76 outbreaks). Of these 333 outbreaks,
272 (82 percent) occurred in long-term--care facilities and 26 (8
percent) in hospitals. Of 216 health-care facility outbreaks with
available data, a total of 7907 patients and 4317 staff members were
affected. Of these, 207 (2.6 percent) patients and 20 (0.5 percent)
staff members were hospitalized, and 16 deaths among patients with
AGE were reported; however the cause of death was not reported. In
October 2005, electronic reporting of outbreaks in health-care
facilities began in New York, which might have increased the
completeness of reporting from these facilities. However, the number
of outbreaks reported by traditional means (that is, fax machine or
telephone) increased 298 percent, from 42 during the 2005-2006 period
to 167 during the 2006-2007 period, suggesting a real increase in incidence.
The New York State Department of Health does not routinely perform
viral testing at the state laboratory for all AGE outbreaks.
Therefore, of the 298 outbreaks that occurred in long-term--care
facilities, only 11 (4 percent) outbreaks had a laboratory-confirmed
etiology; 4 of these had laboratory confirmation of norovirus by
RT-PCR, and 7 had laboratory confirmation of non-viral etiologies.
The majority of outbreaks that did not have a laboratory-confirmed
etiology were clinically and epidemiologically consistent with
norovirus infection (1).
Boston, Massachusetts
---------------------
During 1 Dec 2006-1 Apr 2007, 18 outbreaks characterized by acute
onset of vomiting and diarrhea were reported from colleges, day care
centers, and health-care facilities in Boston, Massachusetts,
affecting 1327 persons, compared with 2 such outbreaks during the
same period in 2005. Of the 2006-2007 outbreaks, 8 were attributed to
norovirus by RT-PCR testing of stool specimens.
The Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC), which coordinates
syndromic surveillance in all 10 Boston hospital EDs, examined data
from the city's EDs to determine whether an AGE increase had
occurred. These EDs submit demographic and chief complaint data to
BPHC every 24 hours. Chief complaints are grouped into syndromes and
analyzed for unusual activity. These data indicated citywide
increases in the number of ED visits for a gastrointestinal syndrome
defined as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea among all age groups during
5 Dec 2006-24 Mar 2007. During this 16-week period, ED visits
attributable to this gastrointestinal syndrome averaged 96 per day
(7.4 percent of all visits), compared with 74 visits per day (5.8
percent of all visits) during the same period in the previous year
(pl less than 0.001, by Pearson's chi-square test).
United States
-------------
CDC solicited information from the health departments of all 50
states and the District of Columbia on the number of 1) AGE outbreaks
reported during October-December 2005 and October-December 2006, 2)
AGE outbreaks in long-term--care facilities, and 3) norovirus
outbreaks confirmed by PCR. Of the 40 states that responded, CDC
reviewed data from 24 states that reported at least 5 outbreaks in
both 2005 and 2006. [Tabulated in the original text.] These 24 states
reported a total of 1316 AGE outbreaks with onset during
October-December 2006; a median of 50 percent occurred in
long-term--care facilities, and a median of 26 percent had laboratory
confirmation of norovirus by RT-PCR. Of these 24 states, 22 (92
percent) reported an increase in the number of outbreaks compared
with the same period in 2005 (range of increase: 18 percent-800
percent). State officials reported that the majority of the outbreaks
with no laboratory confirmation of norovirus had epidemiologic and
clinical evidence suggestive of norovirus infection (1).
CDC laboratory surveillance
---------------------------
During 2006, the National Calicivirus Laboratory at CDC tested 761
stool specimens from 126 AGE outbreaks in the United States for
norovirus by RT-PCR (2). Outbreak settings included cruise ships (n
equal to 37), long-term--care facilities and assisted-living
facilities (n equal to 37), restaurants and catered events (n equal
to 13), hospitals and health-care centers (n equal to 7), colleges
and schools (n equal to 3), parties (n equal to 3), and other
settings (n equal to 3). Norovirus was confirmed in 114 (90 percent)
of these outbreaks, and 87 (76 percent) of these were associated with
2 new GII.4 norovirus variants (Minerva and Laurens) by partial
capsid gene-region sequencing (3). The Minerva strain was detected in
15 (60 percent) of 25 outbreaks during October-December 2006 on
cruise ships and in 8 states; during January-June 2007, the same
strain caused 66 (54 percent) of 122 outbreaks on cruise ships and in
19 states. The Laurens strain was detected in 10 (40 percent) of the
25 outbreaks during October-December 2006 and 33 (27 percent) of the
122 outbreaks during January-June 2007. The partial capsid sequences
of the Minerva and Laurens strains are identical to the GII.4 strains
(GII.4-2006a and GII.4-2006b) reported in 2006 in Europe (4).

MMWR editorial note
-------------------
This report highlights widespread increased frequency of
norovirus-like illness outbreaks and ED visits during
October-December 2006 and January-June 2007. This increase was
associated with the emergence of 2 new co circulating strains of
norovirus GII.4. A previous increase in norovirus outbreaks in the
United States also was associated with the emergence of new strains
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5203a1.htm> 7).
Whether the increase in outbreaks is a result of increased
pathogenicity or transmissibility of new strains, lower immunity in
the population, or other factors is unclear. During late 2006 and
early 2007, increases in AGE outbreaks consistent with norovirus (1)
were reported by many state health departments. A high proportion of
specimens tested were positive for norovirus, which suggests that the
increase in AGE outbreaks was associated with norovirus infection.
The magnitude and consistency of increases in multiple states suggest
an actual increase rather than increased reporting resulting from
increased awareness of and testing for norovirus.
A large proportion of AGE outbreaks in 2006 occurred among residents
of long-term--care facilities, a population that has higher attack
rates from AGE than non-institutionalized populations (6). Illness
compatible with norovirus infection was the primary cause of death
recorded for a resident of a long-term--care facility in North
Carolina; in addition, 2 deaths in Wisconsin and 16 deaths in New
York were associated with AGE outbreaks in health-care facilities.
Norovirus infection as a confirmed cause of death has not been
reported previously in the United States. Additional investigation of
deaths associated with AGE outbreaks in health-care settings is
needed to better understand the role of norovirus.
Noroviruses are the most common cause of sporadic cases and outbreaks
of AGE (8). Transmission occurs via foodborne and person-to-person
routes as well as through contact with contaminated environmental
surfaces. The low infectious dose of norovirus (less than 10 viral
particles) required for transmission, in addition to the virus's
environmental persistence and prolonged shedding after recovery,
coupled with the shared toilet facilities, close living quarters, and
immobile or incontinent residents in long-term--care facilities
predispose these facilities to prolonged outbreaks with high attack
rates (<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5009a1.htm> 9).
Control of norovirus outbreaks depends on consistent enforcement of
measures such as strict hand hygiene and use of effective
environmental disinfectants [see Box in original text] (10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least 2 limitations.
First, no national surveillance system exists for AGE or norovirus
outbreaks that are transmitted from person to person; reporting
methods and completeness of reporting vary substantially by state.
Thus, this report likely underestimates the number of norovirus
outbreaks and cannot accurately quantify the increase in frequency
from 2005 to 2006. Second, laboratory testing for norovirus is
limited to the state public health laboratories, and norovirus
testing is not routinely performed on all specimens from all AGE
outbreaks; the low number of outbreaks with norovirus confirmation
likely reflects this. During October-December 2006, only 29 percent
of all reported AGE outbreaks in 24 states had laboratory
confirmation of norovirus. States such as Wisconsin that routinely
test specimens from outbreaks determined that a high proportion were
attributable to norovirus.
In June 2006, the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists
passed a resolution stating that all AGE outbreaks should be
reportable nationally, regardless of mode of transmission (that is,
foodborne or person to person). This will be implemented in 2008
through the National Outbreak Reporting System. In addition to better
surveillance, specific protocols are needed to investigate the role
of norovirus in diarrheal deaths, particularly among older adults.
Development and application of new, easy-to-use norovirus assays for
routine clinical practice could better define the prevalence of
norovirus among persons with AGE who seek health-care services.
CaliciNet, a centralized database at CDC, is used to collect and
compare norovirus sequences to identify emergent strains, track more
virulent strains in real time, and determine the role of contaminated
foods in their emergence; this database soon will be widely
accessible to state and local health departments.
