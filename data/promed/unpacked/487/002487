[According to OIE, outbreaks of Classical Swine Fever have occurred in
Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala in 2001. El Salvador had an outbreak in
2000. The present outbreak in Costa Rica was preceded by outbreaks in 1997
and 1995.
If Classical Swine Fever (CSF), often called Hog Cholera, is introduced
into a population of susceptible pigs, it can be devastating and
challenging to control. While CSF may be a step down in from Foot & mouth
disease (FMD) in terms of a threat, it certainly poses a major problem when
newly introduced. Let's hope the surveillance and apparent quick action to
stamp out the disease will prevent a widespread problem. - Mod.PC]
