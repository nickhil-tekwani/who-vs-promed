We have a big anthrax problem.
In Basilicata, southern Italy, in the past 2 weeks, we have had many
outbreaks of anthrax, affecting dairy cattle, horses and (3) wild deer. All
these animals were at pasture. Very few goats and sheep have died. Many
dead animals have been found with extravasated blood. Yesterday 2 dairy
cows died, having been vaccinated 4 days beforehand.
[From data provided, the 1st outbreak was noted in late July 2004 and in
retrospect was probably just the usual summer incident. But in late August
this epidemic started, and by 24 Sep 2004 totalled some 36 known outbreaks;
in this hilly area, there are certainly other cases not observed or not
reported. The total recorded cases are 54 cattle, 7 horses, 11 sheep, and 4
red deer. Presumably there have been subsequent outbreaks in the region.]
2 veterinarians have developed cutaneous anthrax.
This mountainous area normally has 2 to 3 outbreaks each summer. This
series of outbreaks has been ascribed to the heavy rains eroding
historically contaminated cattle graves and thus depositing spores in the
pastures.
The MLVA analysis has identified that all strains are genotype 1.
As of 29 Sep 2004 all the animals in the epidemic area have been
vaccinated, and the 2nd vaccination cycle has begun. They are using the
national Carbosap vaccine, for which 2 vaccinations are normal.

[Historically, erosion of cattle graves has been noted as a cause in a
number of outbreaks, for example in Oklahoma a few years ago.
Unfortunately, it is rare that the actual graves can be identified after
the event. This is a hilly broken region with plenty of woodland and small
pastures. While tabanid flies have not been mentioned in the reports, the
heavy rains described would favour their multiplication and involvement.
Such flies favour this type of countryside, and the spread pattern of this
epidemic does point to their involvement. We need to get an entomologist
out to take a look.
We thank Drs Antonio Fasanella, Vincenzo Quaranta, and Beniamino Goga for
the information they provided. - Mod.MHJ]
