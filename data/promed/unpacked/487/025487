Phytoplasma disease in pistachios in Kilis province was high this year [2021] due to low seasonal precipitation and temperature. Samples were taken from orchards and sent to Adana Agricultural Protection and Pistachio Research Institute for analysis. The disease is increasing in pistachio orchards in Kilis, an important area for pistachio production in Turkey, and is devastating producers.

The Provincial Director of Agriculture and Forestry said, "The disease was characterized as _Candidatus_ Phytoplasma solani in 2014. This phytoplasma disease is rife in the provinces and districts where pistachios are cultivated and causes the yield of trees to fall. There has not been any chemical control until now, cultural measures are being attempted."

[_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma solani is the type member of the stolbur (16SrXII) phytoplasma taxonomic group. Stolbur phytoplasmas, alone or in coinfections, have been reported to affect a range of dicotyledoneous crops (including tomato, potato, capsicum, aubergine (eggplant), grapevine, sugar beet), as well as a few monocot hosts such as maize and sugarcane (ProMED posts 20070607.1844, 20080303.0869).

A leaf scorch disease of pistachio (_Pistacia vera_) has been reported to be associated with a member of the group (sub-group 16SrXII-A) in the Middle East and was first reported in Turkey in 2018 (see link below). Other phytoplasmas associated with pistachio diseases include members of 16SrI, 16SrII (witches broom), and 16SrIX.

Phytoplasmas can be spread with infected plant material (tissue cultures, grafting) and by planthopper vectors. Disease management for phytoplasmas may include vector control, removal of pathogen and/or vector reservoirs, use of clean planting or grafting material, and resistant varieties.

Phytoplasma disease outbreaks seem to occur in cycles reflecting insect numbers in vector populations. They are generally favoured by hot, dry conditions which stimulate vector migration into crops. It is therefore unclear why low temperatures are being blamed above for a current high incidence of stolbur in pistachio orchards.

A leaf scorch disease of pistachio caused by the bacterium _Xylella fastidiosa_ has also been reported.
