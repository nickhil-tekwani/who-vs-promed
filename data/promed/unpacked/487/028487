SatelLife and VITA Plan New Developing Country Communications System
Boston, Massachusetts and Arlington, Virginia - Dr. Bernard Lown, Chairman
and Founder of SatelLife, and Henry Norman, President of Volunteers in
Technical Assistance (VITA) announced today an agreement to collaborate in
creating a global e-mail system dedicated to humanitarian and development
purposes. The proposed system will combine the use of HealthSat and
VITASat, as well as gateways to the Internet located at the extreme north
and south of the globe. Both satellites will be part of a system that will
eventually include between five and twelve satellites.
Both non profit organizations agreed to work together to form a coalition
of other organizations that own satellite capacity and are willing to
permit the use of their excess capacity for humanitarian and development
activities in the developing world. All organizations would remain
independent and the program would be carried out through cooperative
agreements rather than the creation of a new entity with its own
bureaucracy. Norman said, "Several American and European organizations
have already indicated their desire to participate."
SatelLife uses HealthSat II to help medical personnel in developing
countries exchange medical information and to consult with their
counterparts around the world. VITA, which has provided technical
information to requestors for forty years, pioneered the non-military use
of LEOs and was awarded a Pioneer's Preference by the Federal
Communications Commission in 1994. The latest VITASat was launched last
September [1997] from Russia.
VITA and SatelLife have agreed that the two organizations will petition the
FCC to permit VITA to share its operational license with SatelLife.
A parallel initiative is beng mounted by VITA and the European
non-governmental organization (NGO), TOOL, to create a coalition of NGOs
and other nonprofit organizations. The NGOs engaged in humanitarian and
development activities in the developing world will have priority use of
the system in exchange for their assistance to indigenous organizations in
developing information technology skills.
Dr. Lown and Mr. Norman agreed that realizing the goals of their
collaboration face many political, regulatory, financial and organizational
hurdles. Details of the joint effort remain to be worked out and approved
by the governing bodies of both groups, as well as those of the others
joining the coalition.
The design of a ground station that can communicate with many different
satellites and yet is inexpensive is critical to the success of this
venture. Licensing users in countries where telecommunications is still a
monopoly will be challenging also. Raising funds and obtaining equipment
will require energy and dedication. However, despite these challenges,
both Lown and Norman expressed confidence that the clear need for reliable,
low cost communications in remote area of the developing world would help
them convince others to join them in the essential effort to overcome the
obstacles to developing country communications.
Lown and Norman state that "poor communications is a major obstacle to
bringing people in remote areas of the developing world into the mainstream
of development. Several studies indicate that improvement in
communications has a demonstrable impact on the improvement of the lives of
people. We commit our two organizations to work together to achieve that
goal."
