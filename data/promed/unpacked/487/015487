Experts to assist in black-faced spoonbill care
------------------------------------------------
The Tainan County Government said yesterday that 2 Japanese pathologists
arrived in Taiwan yesterday to assist in the care and protection of
black-faced spoonbills at the Chiku lagoon in southern Taiwan.
The 2 experts -- Shunji Kozaki and Masato Takeda -- will inspect the Chiku
sanctuary near the estuary of the Tsengwen River in Tainan County Wednesday
and Thursday to see for themselves the endangered species' living
environment, a county official said.
A total of 66 black-faced spoonbills at the wild bird habitat have died of
botulism in the past few weeks, and 12 of the endangered species are still
ill. Initial studies showed that the dead and sick rare birds were infected
with C-type botulinum.
The Japanese specialists are scheduled to conduct pathological experiments
at the National Institute for Animal Health in Tamsui on the outskirts of
Taipei Fri 03 Jan 2003 to get a better understanding of the cause of the
mass die-off of the rare birds. "They will unveil the experimental results
at a news conference scheduled for Saturday," said the county official.
Meanwhile, a legislative group dedicated to promoting sustainable
development has contacted 6 American scholars and experts who are expected
to travel to Taiwan later to conduct a similar study.
Each year, a large number of black-faced spoonbills migrate from the Korean
peninsula and northeastern mainland China to the Chiku wetlands to spend the
winter. Some 700 have arrived so far this year, but this is the first time
that a number of them have died en masse at the wetlands. 10 of the 12
surviving sick birds are now under intensive care at the Tainan County's
Animal Disease Control Center, while the remaining 2 have been sent to the
Taiwan Endemic Species Research Institute in Nantou in central Taiwan for
special treatment.
Many volunteer firemen, conservationists, and local residents have been busy
picking up dead fish and animals at the Chiku wild bird sanctuary in the
past weeks, hoping to curb a further spread of botulism. Meanwhile, a group
of legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, including Chou
Ching-yu, came up with a draft bill yesterday demanding that the government
set up a special study and management center for the endangered spoonbill.

[This is a clear confirmation that, as suspected, the etiology of the
outbreak in Taiwan is indeed botulism, allegedly caused by _C.botulinum_
toxin type C.
Black-faced spoonbills are a "critically endangered" species ("facing a very
high risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future"), seen only in
East Asia; their world population is estimated at less than 1000 birds. The
main wintering sites are at the Tseng Wen Estuary, Taiwan and the Mai Po and
Inner Deep Bay Ramsar Site, Hong Kong. Small numbers winter at other coastal
locations. The main known breeding area are the rocky islands off the west
coast of the Korean Peninsula.
The birds reach Taiwan beginning in mid-October, peaking in December. After
resting during the day, they hunt for fish in fish-preserving ponds from
nightfall till morning; this lifestyle continues throughout winter. They
return to their breeding places in March and April. A good source of
information is the publication of the Wild Bird Society of Japan, Tokyo
"Conservation and Research of Black-faced Spoonbills and their Habitat"
(2nd Ed), Ueta, M., Kurosawa, R. & Allen, D. (eds), 2000.
