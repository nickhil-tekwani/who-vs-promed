FAO/OIE/WHO call for targeted strategy including poultry vaccination to
help curb avian flu. Experts issue recommendations to manage crisis
--------------------------------------------------
A targeted vaccination campaign for poultry at risk of being infected by
the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus may be required in heavily
affected countries to control the further spread of the epidemic, according
to global animal and human health experts gathered for emergency talks at
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
Issuing a series of recommendations after 2 days of discussions, the group
of experts, including representatives from the World Animal Health
Organisation (OIE) and the World Health Organization (WHO) said vaccinating
animals could be one method -- along with culling and other priority
measures -- to contain the spread of the virus.
The mass culling of flocks outside of infected sites in reaction to
outbreaks might therefore be largely avoided and major damage to the
livelihoods of rural households and national economies averted.
"We are confident that with broad international and regional collaboration
in support of national efforts and using all available intervention tools,
the crisis can be overcome and the risk to human health minimised," said
Joseph Domenech, Chief of FAO's Animal Health Service.
"Culling infected flocks remains the recommended response when the disease
is detected," he said, adding, "Vaccination, when used together with other
control measures, such as market and movement management, and good
agricultural practices, offers a suitable means to support the suppression
of the further spread of the virus."
Experts emphasised the importance of protecting people directly in contact
with infected or suspected birds. They agreed that such targeted
vaccination would help prevent animals falling ill and reduce the amount of
virus present in the environment, the so-called "viral load".
Minimising viral load will reduce the potential of avian influenza
spreading to humans, if accompanied by strict control measures such as
surveillance, elimination of infected birds, animal movement control, and
observation of basic hygiene in animal production.
Experts agreed that the vaccination plan, using a vaccine that meets OIE's
international quality standards, should be accompanied by clear monitoring
and surveillance of the rapidly changing situation.
"Things are changing daily, and we need a concerted and co-ordinated
response," FAO's Domenech said, adding that veterinary and medical
authorities should report cases of outbreaks of avian influenza in their
country to the OIE and WHO as soon as they are detected, and keep them
informed of the evolving situation.
The experts agreed that vaccine manufacturers have some stocks of relevant
vaccines available, but that they would need a few months to gear up to
produce sufficient amounts of the required vaccines.
The recommendations issued by the experts included the need for substantial
international financial support to fund the intensified control measures
required, including personal protective equipment, and the creation of
country-specific guidelines and regional coordination programmes.
"These measures will not only help deal with the immediate crisis but will
also lay the ground for capacity building programmes for national
veterinary administrations. Priorities will be on surveillance and
monitoring of animal diseases; these measures will also help to rebuild the
damaged export markets in the region," said Bernard Vallat,
Director-General of OIE.
"Controlling the outbreak at its source, through the safe elimination of
infected flocks supported by vaccination where required, would minimise the
risk to human health", said WHO's Francois Meslin.

[2] European response

Avian influenza: update on European response
---------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Viet Nam and the World Health Organization (WHO)
have confirmed 3 new cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)
A/H5N1 in humans. This brings the total number of confirmed cases to date
in Viet Nam to 13. 9 of these patients have died, 2 are still in hospital,
and 2 have recovered. The Thai government has also announced a new
laboratory case of human infection, bringing the total number of Thai cases
to 4 (2). All 4 of these patients have died.
As of 3 Feb 2004, the WHO has confirmed outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1)
among poultry in 9 countries in South East and East Asia (Cambodia, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Viet
Nam). China has announced that a further 8 Chinese provinces are
potentially affected, making a total of 12 out of 31 of China's provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities having confirmed or suspected cases
of HPAI in poultry. No human cases have so far been reported in countries
other than Thailand and Viet Nam.
The European Union (EU) responded initially to the outbreaks in these
countries by banning imports of poultry meat and eggs. The Standing
Committee for Food Chain and Animal Health
(<http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/rc/scfcah/index_en.html>) has now
agreed to extend the ban on imports into the EU from Thailand of poultry
meat and meat products, wild and farmed feathered game and eggs, for 6
months until 15 Aug 2004. This ban is subject to continuous review with a
view to amend it if the situation allows this. No specific ban has been
placed on imports of these products from other affected countries
(including China, Cambodia, Japan) as importation of these products is not
allowed for other reasons. The ban does not apply to Thai poultry meat
products from birds slaughtered before 1 Jan 2004 or to products which have
been heated to over 70 deg C, as these pose no risk for disease introduction.
The EU has also banned the import of live pet birds from Asian countries
affected by avian flu. These birds were already subject to a 30-day
quarantine period on entering EU member states, and compulsory testing for
avian influenza, but in the light of the recent developments, imports have
been suspended entirely as a precautionary measure. Imports of unprocessed
feathers are also banned. In 2003, almost 100 000 pet birds (most of them
psittacines: parrots, cockatoos, and budgerigars) were imported from Asia;
mainly from China, Pakistan, and Indonesia.
Travel advice issued by the health ministries of various EU member states
has included the following, based on original recommendations from the WHO (5):
- Travellers should avoid contact with live poultry, live poultry markets,
and farms. It is known that large amounts of the avian flu virus are
excreted in infected bird droppings and that the virus can persist in the
environment for a long time, therefore contact with surfaces with which
bird or animal droppings have also had contact should be avoided.
- Because of the good virus viability, hygiene measures such as frequent
washing of hands should be strictly observed, including after any contact
with animals.
- Poultry meat or products and eggs should only be consumed in the affected
areas if they have been thoroughly cooked, i.e. have reached a temperature
of 70 degrees C or above the whole way through.
2 EU public health experts have gone to Viet Nam to assist the Vietnamese
authorities and the WHO with their efforts to contain the human outbreak.
The experts are from research institutes in Germany and the Netherlands and
are fellows of the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology
Training. They join an EU animal health expert sent to Viet Nam last week
to assist in efforts to eradicate the disease from the country's poultry farms.
A joint United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World
Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), and WHO emergency meeting on avian
influenza convened in Rome on 3 and 4 Feb 2004. Its purpose was to set
policies and strategies for controlling the disease and develop action
plans to address the animal as well as public health concerns in each
affected country. Participants included top veterinary experts from some 14
countries. Several chief veterinary officers from Asian countries
participated via teleconference.
