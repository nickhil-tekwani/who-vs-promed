A 2nd human case of anthrax infection has emerged in Saskatchewan.
More than 663 animals have died in what health officials have called the
worst anthrax outbreak in decades. However, human infections are much more
rare.
A Yorkton-area veterinarian contracted the cutaneous type of the disease
last week and is being treated with antibiotic ointment. He said he
scratched some welts on his ankle after he had been testing dead cattle for
anthrax. He said he must have had anthrax spores on his fingers at the time
and that's how he got an infection.
"A week later, the thing becomes an inch and a half in diameter and gets
this black spot, which is typical for cutaneous anthrax," he said
Wednesday. "Just a mild irritation is all it is. I guess it is a bit itchy."
He said he was surprised he got the infection because he used safety
measures. "Even though I did take precautions, wearing gloves and so forth.
But I guess it can still happen," he said. Thanks to the antibiotics, the
infection has almost healed, he said.
The 1st case of human anthrax infection in 2006 occurred in July, when a
Melfort-area farmer was affected. He had the same kind of infection as Wood
and has since recovered.
Officials with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency say the outbreak is
slowing. There had been no new cases of animal deaths in Saskatchewan in
CFIA's last report on Tuesday.

[This is not an atypical story or series of events. Fortunately the
veterinarian's infection was mild and responded well to antibiotics, as it
should. What surprises folks is that with all the fuss about anthrax, the
lesion merely itches, which is pathognomonic. Normally skin lesions are on
the hands and forearms. If you scratch your face or rub your eye it can be
much more interesting, and oropharyngeal lesions are frequently fatal. If
you see someone with a US quarter-sized circular scar on their hand or
forearm it is usually safe to imitate Sherlock Holmes and say, "I see you
had anthrax." It impresses the uninformed no end.
Bob Allen tells me that the Saskatchewan and Manitoba reports will be
weekly from now on. His work is much appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
