Suggest staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome could account for the findings
in the above case.

In this case it might be helpful to know [the patient's] occupation, travel
history including when he was last in West Africa, and his social habits -
alcohol intake, etc. in arriving at a diffential diagnosis.
As far as the infectious diseases are concerned, with the exclusion of
[hepatitis viruses and hantaviruses, other diseases] which I have managed
with similar picture are:
Falciparum Malaria ( needs - 3 Negative films) [to rule out]
Leptospirosis
Legionella pneumophila
I will be interested to know your final diagnosis.

[Final diagnosis by C.H. Calisher: I don't know. I would hope that the
appropriate experts in Germany will let us know the cause of the patient's
death, if it is ever determined. Let's just end this string here. -- Mod CHC]
