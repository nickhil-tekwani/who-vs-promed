[Undiagnosed deaths in about 40 livestock (cattle and goats) in the subdistrict ("upazila") Kaliganj, Bangladesh, were informed in a media report cited in ProMED-mail's post 20170218.4849121, requesting information on the outcome of the undertaken investigation. Erroneously, we regarded Kaliganj to be situated in Dhaka Division; it appears that the event took place, in fact, in the Kaliganj sub-district of Lalmonirhat district, Rangpur division (upazilas named Kaliganj are to be found in several of the country's divisions, such as, Dhaka, Khulna, and Rangpur).

The following information, circulated by ProMED-mail regional network "ProMED-SoAs", puts the information straight and provides the requested information on the event. It was summarised by Mod.PKB from the responses received from 2 EpiCore members in Bangladesh who wished to remain anonymous. The ProMED-SoAs posting expressed gratefulness to them, for their excellent rapid responses and their help to validate the media report. We add our thanks and appreciation.

On [17 Feb 2017] local newspapers from Kaliganj [upazila], Lalmonirhat [district] reported 33 deaths of domestic animals (cattle and goats) over 5 days from pashuram community at South Dalgram [probably a village]. Tremor was noticed in hind limbs, later gas accumulated in the abdomen, and seizures developed over the whole body. The affected cows died in 1.5 hours and the goats usually died within 10 min after showing symptoms. Since [15 Feb 2017] 33 domestic animals from 12 farmers have died. [Similar mortality was seen in January-February of 2015 and 2016 in the same geographical location, when 12 and 15 livestock, respectively, died. The Veterinary Surgeon of Lalmonirhat assumed the cause was food poisoning.

The livestock officers of Rangpur and Lalmonirhat districts confirmed that the deaths of the livestock were not due to an infectious cause. The blood samples of the dead animals revealed the presence of increased level of nitrate, suggesting nitrate poisoning as the probable cause of their deaths. The history revealed that the farmers fed their animals newly grown grass on the previous days of deaths. It was found that newly grown grass there also contained high amounts of nitrate. Also, there might have been OPC [organophosphate] poisoning.

[Lalmonirhat is a district at the northern border of Bangladesh. It is a part of Rangpur Division. Lalmonirhat includes 5 upazilas: Patgram, Hatibandha, Aditmari, Kaliganj, and Lalmonirhat Sadar (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalmonirhat_District).

The following commentary, addressing an earlier event in Bangladesh, by Mod.TG, was published in 20140131.2245222:
"There are certain grasses that are capable of accumulating nitrate. Nitric acid would be something applied to the grass vs the grass accumulating nitrate. Grasses high in nitrates can kill cattle rapidly.

Alternatively some grasses may accumulate prussic acid, a type of cyanide. Prussic acid, hydrocyanic acid, and hydrogen cyanide are all terms relating to cyanide poisoning. Certain grasses may accumulate large quantities of cyanogenic glycosides, (a sugar compound with cyanide attached) which are located in the outer tissue or epidermal layer of the plant.

An enzyme resides in the inner or mesophyll leaf tissues. When an event stresses the plant, such as frost, drought, drought followed by rain and a sudden burst of growth, or trauma to the plant, the mesophyll portion of the plant or leaf releases the enzyme, which breaks down the cyanogenic glycosides releasing the cyanide compound and the sugar. The sugar makes the plant tasty and cyanide makes the plant deadly."
