[The submission below is in response to the posting entitled Brucellosis,
bovine - Cyprus, which was based upon an article in a Cypriote newspaper -
Sunday Mail, and to 2 subsequential responses, one from James Perdue and
the other one from Nick Honhold, both included in the posting Brucellosis,
bovine - Cyprus (02). (References below). Dr Loucaides, the Director of
the Veterinary Services of Cyprus, is gratefully acknowledged for his
authoritative clarifying comments].

The species of Brucella present in Cyprus is _B. melitensis_ of the Biotype
1. It is found in sheep, goats, and cattle. For its identification in
Cyprus, the laboratory methods used are the Rose Bengal, Serum
Agglutination, Complement Fixation and ELISA tests.

_B. melitensis_ was endemic in Cyprus before the 1970s. After a successful
15-year eradication campaign, the island was declared free from
Brucellosis. However, in 1997 the disease reappeared and a new Brucellosis
campaign was reintroduced with the purpose of eliminating the disease.

The statement in the first posting, indicating that "the Cyprus government
is forced to slaughter the animals, as at least 25 percent of the herd have
been found to carry brucella", might be interpreted as relating to the
national herd and, as such, is not correct. The real situation is that when
more that 25 percent of the animals in a given herd are found positive to
Brucella examinations, all animals in that particular herd are slaughtered.
If the rate of infection on the farm is found to be lower than 25 percent,
only the infected animals are slaughtered.

Presently, the infection rate of bovine herds is 3.9 percent (13 positive
herds out of a total of 330 herds) and the infection rate of sheep and goat
herds is 1 percent (41 positive herds out of 4121 herds).

This low infection rate permits continuation of a test and slaughter policy
instead of vaccinations. (re: response submission by Nick Honhold). A
number of other measures e.g., quarantine of infected herds, disinfections,
etc, are also applied.

In accordance with the EC Council Directive 78/52/EEC, the following
procedures regarding milk handling are applied in Cyprus:

Milk from infected farms of sheep/goats is initially heat-treated (75
degrees C for 5 minutes) on the farm level and only subsequently permitted
to be transported to the dairies. Regarding cows' milk, this is transferred
for pasteurization before any other use.

Furthermore, it is emphasized that any milk products produced in Cyprus are
either from pasteurized milk or the products themselves are heated during
their manufacture at a temperature higher than 85 degrees C.

Milk from infected cows may only be fed to animals on the same farm after
heat treatment. (re: response submission by James Perdue).

[Since the discovery of _B. melitensis_ by Sir David Bruce and its
publication ("Note on the discovery of a microorganism in Malta fever".
Practitioner, London, 1897, 39: 161-170) the disease caused by _B.
melitensis_ has acquired several names: Bruce's septicaemia, Cyprus fever,
Gibraltar fever, Malta fever, Mediterranean fever, Neapolitan fever, and
undulant fever -- all applicable to the disease in humans. The official OIE
name of the disease caused by _B. melitensis_ in small ruminants, is
"caprine and ovine brucellosis". As indicated by one of the applied names,
indeed Cyprus has long been one of the most heavily stricken countries. _B.
melitensis_ found to be endemic in sheep and goats and -- to a smaller
extent -- in dairy cows. The accomplishment of the remarkable eradication
programme enabled Cyprus to obtain the status of "a country officially free
from caprine and ovine brucellosis" in 1985. According to CHAPTER 2.4.2. of
the International Animal Health Code of the OIE, to qualify as officially
free from caprine and ovine brucellosis, a country must satisfy the
requirements below :
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/MCode/A_00070.htm>

a) the occurrence or suspected occurrence of caprine and ovine brucellosis
has been notifiable for at least 5 years; and

b) all flocks of sheep and goats in the country or zone are under official
veterinary control; and either

c) 99.8 percent of these flocks are qualified as officially free from
caprine and ovine brucellosis; or

d) no case of brucellosis in sheep or goats has been reported for at least
5 years, and no sheep or goat has been vaccinated against the disease for
at least 3 years.

Hopefully, a strict application of the "test and slaughter" policy without
vaccination, combined with restriction of animal movement, disinfection
measures, and compensation of farmers in case of positive results, will
allow the Cyprus Veterinary Services to regain the country's disease-free
status. Fortunately, the (herd) infection rate, in small ruminants, has not
(yet) exceeded 1.0 percent. The situation is much worse in other
Near-Eastern countries, where vaccination has become unavoidable. The EU
has launched, several years ago, a _B. melitensis_ eradication programme in
5 of its Mediterranean member-countries.

Cyprus is free from _Brucella abortus_. The last case reported was in 1921
and, according to reports, during serological surveillance programs no
positive animals have been detected since.

Generally, the penetration of _B. melitensis_ into cattle farms is regarded
as a spin-off from infected flocks of sheep and goats. Cattle infections
are, in most cases, not associated with abortion storms. As observed in
Israel, where several dairy cattle farms got infected during recent years,
the eradication of _B. melitensis_ from dairy cattle involve additional
concerns in comparison to the eradication of _B. abortus_. Humans easily
contract _B. melitensis_ due to the extremely low inoculum dose required.
Since the bacteria are excreted in the milk, which in the cow is produced
in large quantities, the requirement to remove the udder and internal
organs from slaughtered cows would necessarily lead to exposure of the
abattoir personnel to huge amounts of the organisms. To reduce the risks it
is therefore recommended that the cows be dried off prior to sending them
to slaughter. See
