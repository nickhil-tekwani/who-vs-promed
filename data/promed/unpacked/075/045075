CHIKUNGUNYA - INDIAN OCEAN UPDATE (21): INDIA (CALCUTTA)

Chikungunya, a fever that causes intense joint ache, has struck Calcutta
after 44 years. The usually non-fatal viral disease, caused by mosquito
bites, was detected in North 24-Parganas last October [2006]. Now the virus
has been found in 3 of 5 blood samples collected from central Calcutta and
Beliaghata [an area in Calcutta. - Mod.TY].
Health department sources said that 31 samples, collected from Calcutta and
Habra in North 24-Parganas, had been sent to the Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR), Calcutta, for the chikungunya test. "Altogether 26
samples, including 3 from Calcutta, tested positive," an official said
today [6 Aug 2007]. "We received the reports this evening [6 Aug 2007]."
Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya said the information hadn't reached him.
Chikungunya, spread by the bites of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, was
detected in 15-odd villages in North 24-Parganas' Baduria and Swarupnagar
last year [2006].
This year [2007], some 500 people in Habra's wards 13 and 16 and their
neighbourhoods have been showing the symptoms for over a month. But none
needed to be admitted to hospital.
Other than joint pain, headache, and fever, patients often develop rashes
on their limbs. Young adults usually take 5 to 15 days to recover while the
elderly can take months. Only rarely do people die.
But when chikungunya had struck Calcutta in 1963, some 200 people are said
to have died. Tens of thousands were taken ill and many of the cases were
haemorrhagic (accompanied with bleeding), the ICMR Journal's May 1980 issue
says. "Usually, chikungunya doesn't kill," an expert said. "Those deaths
may have been caused by an accompanying infection by, say, the dengue virus."
There is no vaccine or specific treatment, but the anti-malaria drug
chloroquine has been known to provide relief. The state has procured ELISA
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits that can confirm chikungunya
[infection] in 2 days.
The precautions are the same as those for malaria, aimed at avoiding
mosquito bites. In North 24-Parganas' affected areas, Red Cross teams have
begun a drive to destroy mosquito larvae, and people have been asked to
prevent accumulation of fresh water.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving follow-up reports on this outbreak,
and the progress being made in controlling the mosquito vector.
