Two Die in Typhoid Outbreak
---------------------------
At least 2 people have died in the past 2 weeks following an outbreak of
typhoid fever in Nakuru town. Sources at the town's Public Health
Department told the Nation the 2 victims were from Ojuka estate.
At the same time, President Moi yesterday directed Ministry of Health
officials to move fast and curb the typhoid fever outbreak. The Head of
State said government officers must ensure that the water supplied to the
residents was properly treated. He said the outbreak, which has been
reported in a number of estates in the town, must not be allowed to escalate.
Some 17 patients are admitted at 2 hospitals within the town. Scores of
other victims are recuperating in their homes.
Administration Police officers told reporters that 16 colleagues were
suffering from the disease within the Bondeni Administration Police Lines.
Most victims are complaining of diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, abdominal
pain and high fever among other symptoms.
The affected estates are Ojuka, Baharini, Paul Machanga, Bondeni, Abong
Loweya, Lumumba, Manyani, Flamingo, Shauri Yako, Lake View and Kivumbini.
Records at the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital indicated that the
hospital had been receiving an average of 9 typhoid cases daily over the
past 3 weeks. The hospital's medical superintendent, Dr John Kibosia,
confirmed that 13 patients, including children, were admitted in various
wards. Four children aged between 3 and 12 years were admitted in Ward 2.
All the children are from Bondeni estate.
A Nakuru Maternity Nursing Home official told the Nation that 4 people were
admitted there.
The District Medical Officer Health, Dr Kipsang Marachi, however said it
was still too early to say whether "what we are having are typhoid cases."
Dr Marachi, and a team of officers, spent the better part of the morning
scrutinising records at the provincial hospital to "establish the pattern
of diseases which have been treated over the past 3 months." The medic and
his team later toured various estates where he inspected the sanitary
conditions.
