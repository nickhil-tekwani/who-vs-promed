----------------------------------------------------------------------
The United States Department of Agriculture [USDA], Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service [APHIS], Veterinary Services would like to provide this response to the request for information in the post referenced above.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa is responsible for diagnosis of VSV [vesicular stomatitis virus] infections in equidae and is an OIE reference laboratory for VSV. The NVSL would like to respond to the request for information on the current VSV outbreak.

A diagnosis of VSV infection is made through serologic and virus detection methods. In the Utah case, virus was isolated and determined to be the New Jersey serogroup.

For additional information on the current VSV situation, ProMED-mail readers are referred to the APHIS website (http://1.usa.gov/1DvlsAA).

[We appreciate the USDA responding in such a timely manner. Thank you for sharing the strain of virus in the Utah case.

Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a member of the genus _Vesiculovirus_ in the family _Rhabdoviridae_. The 2 major serotypes are New Jersey and Indiana. Currently, 4 viruses are known to cause vesicular stomatitis: vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSV-IN; formerly known as the Indiana 1 subtype of VSV), vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSV-NJ), vesicular stomatitis Alagoas virus (VSV-AV; formerly Indiana 3), and Cocal virus (formerly Indiana 2). The genus _Vesiculovirus_ also contains related viruses (such as Piry virus) which have been isolated from animals, humans, and/or arthropods and may cause vesicles after experimental inoculation
