Wildlife officials probe deaths of dozens of deer
-------------------------------------------------
Montana wildlife officials say dozens of white-tailed deer have been
found dead or dying in northeastern Montana's Milk River Valley and
surrounding areas since the beginning of August 2011.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (FWP) officials say they don't know
what's caused the deaths, but they suspect it may be epizootic
hemorrhagic disease. The disease, which affects white-tailed deer, is
marked by hemorrhaging, fever, and an urge to be near fresh water to
cool down.

FWP spokesman Ron Selden says samples sent to a state lab to determine
the cause of the deaths won't be returned until next week. He says the
agency is asking residents' help in learning the extent of the
outbreak locations by calling the FWP office in Glasgow when they spot
an affected animal.

[It is culicoides season. Culicoides, no-seeums, or biting midges
carry the virus responsible for epizootic hemorrhagic disease. The
description of the dying animals fits the EHD pattern.

EHD-affected animals typically seek water, have a fever and die fairly
rapidly.

We look forward to the results from the laboratory. - Mod.TG]
