Emergency BSE controls designed to prevent people and animals eating
infected beef and offal were flouted for years by the meat industry,
according to a former senior Government vet who investigated working
practices in abattoirs. A statutory ban on Specified Bovine Offals [SBO
--
the term for the highest risk materials including brain, spleen and
spinal
cord -- from the human and animal food chain was treated "as a joke" by
some
in the meat industry, Andrew Fleetwood, a former Ministry of Agriculture
expert in animal diseases, claims in a statement to the BSE inquiry.
Yet these controls, which were introduced in 1989, together with a ban
on
using rendered ruminant animal protein in animal food, were regarded by
the
Government as its "first line of defence" against the spread of BSE,
which
has since been linked to the deaths of 27 people from a new variant of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
The former vet says that instead of removing and staining SBOs for
destruction to prevent them being eaten by mistake, some abattoirs
allowed
them to leave the premises either attached to carcasses or in unmarked
batches of waste destined to be processed into meat and bone meal. The
importance of these controls was reinforced in the light of experiments
in
1996-97 indicating that rendering processes for animal waste were not
potent
enough to kill the BSE agent.
Mr Fleetwood, who will be questioned at the inquiry in London today,
tells
how one meat industry consultant warned MAFF in June 1995, nine months
before the beef crisis broke, that "unscrupulous abattoirs had cheated
and
would continue to cheat the SBO legislation and that it was little
better
than a joke in certain quarters of the industry." On the basis of his
own
inquiries and knowledge, that "there was likely to be deliberate evasion
of
the SBO controls in the industry".
He also tells how, by late 1995, ministers and senior MAFF staff,
including
Keith Meldrum, the chief veterinary officer, were becoming "greatly
concerned" that the SBO restrictions were not working properly despite
efforts to tighten them. They were also worried about lack of
enforcement by
the Meat Hygiene Service.
He said he was "puzzled" why "widespread and serious breaches" of the
SBO
controls had not been picked up earlier in spot checks by Government
vets.
Mr Fleetwood said: "My suspicion was that staff from the State
Veterinary
Service inspecting slaughterhouses were often quite junior and easily
browbeaten by the slaughterhouse managers. I also had doubts about the
extent to which these visits were truly unannounced, as they were
supposed
to be."
He was concerned about incidents where offals were not stained properly
--
sometimes because the wrong kind of dye was used. An older type of black
dye
could perish and disappear after 48 hours, making it impossible to
identify
which offals had been marked. But when the ministry, at his instigation,
prescribed a more efficient blue dye -- known as Patent Blue V -- some
abattoirs did not use it.
Despite tighter surveillance further breaches of the regulations
continued
to come to light, which he set out in a report to the Government in
October
1995. The report said: "This showed a continuing high failure rate at
slaughterhouses which I found very disappointing. Although I was largely
satisfied with the way in which the SVS staff were carrying out
surveillance, I was concerned about the attitude of the industry and
also
the effectiveness of enforcement by the Meat Hygiene Service."
Mr Fleetwood left MAFF in 1996 to take up a post in research and
development
in the pharmaceutical industry.
