Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Swine / - / - / - / - / -

[Note: the disease has been reported in 33 prefectures: Aomori, Ehim, Fukuoka, Okinawa, Saitama, Toyoma, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Tochigi, Fukui, Kagawasaga, Iwate, Yamagata, Aichi, Tottori, Chiba, Niigata, Oita, Miyazaki, Hokkaido, Fukushima, Shizuoka, Kochi, Kagoshima, Ibaraki, Gunma, Ishikawa, Gifu, Miyagi, Akita, Mie, Okayama.

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a notifiable disease in Japan and there are PED vaccines approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. In October 2013, an outbreak of PED was confirmed after an absence of 7 years. Number of outbreaks started to increase from December 2013 in the Southern Kyushu area. The number of outbreaks in the Southern Kyushu area temporarily decreased in February 2014, however, it started to increase again in March 2014 and at the same time, outbreaks were confirmed in the Northern Kyushu area and other prefectures in the Northern part of Japan. Numbers of newly affected prefectures by month are as follows: October (1), November (1), December (2), January (1), February (2), March (10), April (16). In addition, diagnostic test result indicated in this report is only on the 1st case in October 2013. Outbreaks after the 1st case are diagnosed at local laboratories in each prefecture by the same method. According to genetic analysis by the National Institute of Animal Health, viruses isolated from the cases in October and November 2013 were close to the viruses isolated in the People's Republic of China and the United States of America in 2013.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; disinfection of infected premises/establishment (s); no vaccination; treatment of affected animals (supportive care)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Okinawa Livestock Hygiene Centre (local laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
swine / immunohistochemical test / 1 Oct 2013 / Positive
swine / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 1 Oct 2013/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, an "emerging disease" means "a new infection or infestation resulting from the evolution or change of an existing pathogenic agent, a known infection or infestation spreading to a new geographic area or population, or a previously unrecognized pathogenic agent or disease diagnosed for the 1st time and which has a significant impact on animal or public health." This definition led the USA recently to report porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED), which is not included among OIE's listed reportable animal diseases, as an 'emerging disease' being a "novel swine enteric coronavirus" (see ProMED-mail archive 20140423.2422215). The background to Japan's immediate notification of PED as an emerging disease is explained in the epidemiological comments included in the notification.

Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a viral disease of swine caused by a coronavirus and characterised by watery diarrhoea and emaciation affecting all ages of pigs. Clinical signs include anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. The disease is clinically similar to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE).

The disease was 1st reported in the UK in 1971 and was subsequently identified in many other European countries, China, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, and Viet Nam. PED was first identified in the United States in May 2013 and, since January 2014, also in Canada.

The 1st case in Japan was confirmed in the 1980s. After an absence of about 7 years, PED reappeared in October 2013 in the Okinawa prefecture, followed by the prefectures of Kagoshima, Miyazaki, and Ibaraki.

PED is restricted to porcines. It is not zoonotic.
