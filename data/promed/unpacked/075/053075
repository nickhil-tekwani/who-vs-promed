[2] Media report
Date: Fri 2 Dec 2016

The National Reference Laboratory of the National Food Safety Agency (ANSES) has confirmed the positive results of bluetongue (FCO) in 3 sheep in a herd in Bonifacio [according to the above OIE notification, there were 9 ovine cases, of which 8 were fatal].

To prevent spread of the disease, the livestock were placed under enhanced surveillance. The animals are to remain on the farm.

There are more than 25 serotypes of bluetongue, more or less pathogenic. Serotype 4 has already been the source of a significant outbreak in 2003 in Corsica, said the Prefecture.

A supported vaccination campaign by the state has been in place since the notification of an outbreak earlier this year [2016] in Sardinia, from farms in the Caligri area. This is where the infection comes from [see comment].

"It is very likely that southern winds [from Sardinia] have transmitted infected midges into southern Corsica," said Laurent Larivi√®re, Assistant District Director of the Departmental Directorate of Social Cohesion and Of the Protection of the Populations in Corse-du-Sud.

Breeders who have not vaccinated their animals are strongly encouraged to contact their veterinary surgeons as soon as possible.

[The list of restriction zones per bluetongue serotype that have been demarcated by the EU Member States can be found in the following table that shows the latest information regarding this issue; see table at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones_en.pdf.

A map showing the location of the restriction zones can also been seen at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map.jpg.

Sardinia island is an Italian territory adjacent to the southern tip of the French island of Corsica. According to the above map and table, most of Sardinia's territory is a BTV seroype 1, 16 zone, with serotype 4 present only on the island's southern tip, the most distant one from Corsica. Corsica is signed as a zone of 5 BTV serotypes, namely 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16. Vaccination against the recognised serotypes is permitted by EU within the respective zones.

According to Italy's semiannual report from January-June 2016, during the said period, 93 cases of BT (serotypes 1 and 4) were reported from several provinces. In Sardinia, 6 outbreaks of the said 2 serotypes were recorded, of which one was bovine, 5 caprine and 4 ovine. No differentiation between cases of serotype 1 and 4 was included. In Sicily, 23 outbreaks caused by the same 2 serotypes were reported during the same period. - Mods.CRD/AS
