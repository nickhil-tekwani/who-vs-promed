More than 4000 residents in the Arbajahan and Eldas camps, near the
Kenya-Ethiopia border are suffering an epidemic of dysentery (etiology not

So far there have been reports of 10 fatal cases.

[Benenson's definition of dysentery is "scant stools containing
blood &/or mucus, caused by _Shigella_ or certain other organisms,"
as opposed to hemorrhagic colitis, which is "watery diarrhea
containing gross blood but with no fever or fecal leukocytes."
Since Kenya is in East Africa & Liberia in West Africa, there is no
reason to believe these 2 current outbreaks are linked - Mod.JW
