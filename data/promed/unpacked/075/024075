The Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) epidemic is not just bad luck. It is also
a symptom of under-investment in a depressed industry.
Although FMD inevitably brings bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to
mind, it is a different order of problem. BSE infects people. FMD does not.
The FMD outbreak is not about an unquantifiable risk to human life, but
about money; and that, aside from the need to contain the disease, is the
main topic of conversation between farmers and politicians this week.
The 1967 outbreak of FMD, in which 440 000 animals were killed, is reckoned
to have cost 150 million GBP (US $400 million), or 1.6 billion GBP at
today's prices. Only a fifth of that was compensation paid to farmers whose
animals were destroyed. The rest was made up of, for instance, income
forgone from lost sales and depressed prices.
This time, the government is paying less in real terms per head -- about
460 GBP per cow, 70 per pig, and 45 per sheep. But the total costs may be
higher. In 1967 the disease was confined to Shropshire, bits of north
Wales, and most of north-west England. This time round, cases have been
reported all over Britain, implying the slaughter will be much more widespread.
Sion Roberts, the National Farmers' Union's chief economist, reckons the
cost of the epidemic will be about 253 million GBP a month. This includes
everything from the extra feed costs of keeping animals on farms instead of
sending them for slaughter, to the costs faced by food-processing firms
whose supplies of meat are being interrupted. But it does not include the
long-term damage caused by consumers losing confidence in British-produced
food.
So could this outbreak have been prevented? Some people think so, and blame
under investigation in Britain's state veterinary service. The agriculture
ministry had 43 regional animal health offices 10 years ago, staffed by 303
veterinarians. Last year, it ran half as many offices with a fifth fewer
vets. The number of government laboratories for disease testing has also
fallen. As Joe Brownlie of the Royal Veterinary College points out, this
understaffing makes it more difficult to provide surveillance for emerging
diseases such as FMD.
Farmers' poverty may be part of the problem, too. Impoverished farmers are
unlikely to call out a private vet on a whim, and might hesitate to do so
in the case of FMD, which can be confused with other diseases, especially
since the disease has not been seen in Britain for decades. There is some
suggestion the first case of FMD this time round may have passed undetected
for several weeks on its home farm before eventually being spotted by vets
at the abattoir.
Surely, given the potential risk, vaccination should be an option. EU
countries used to vaccinate animals, but gave up 10 years ago, when they
had gotten rid of the disease. These days, they rely on stamping out
occasional outbreaks, and try to protect themselves with strict controls on
food and livestock coming in from abroad, including checks on livestock to
ensure they carry no signs of the disease. This poses a problem for those
who vaccinate their animals: the vaccine stimulates an animal's immune
system to produce antibodies in much the same way as the real virus does,
and many tests for FMD cannot distinguish between the viral and vaccine
antibodies.
Better vaccines, which allow vets to distinguish immunized from infected
animals, would help protect against FMD. But the problem, again, is not so
much science as economics. As Johann Vanhemelrijck, head of the European
Federation of Animal Health, points out, there is not much incentive to
produce high-tech vaccines for livestock. The animal health market is worth
roughly 4 percent of the market in human medicines. Until farming becomes a
richer business, burning carcasses will be the main means of getting rid of
this disease.
