China -- 10 H7N9 cases including 10 deaths reported by Zhejiang province for March 2015; 8 new cases not previously known
----------------------------------------------------------------------
FluTrackers (Sharon Sanders, editor-in-chief) posted a report from the Zhejiang Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission that includes notification that Zhejiang Province detected 10 H7N9 cases during March 2015.

March 2015 (at 0:00 on 1 Mar 2015 to 31 Mar 2015), the province reported a total of 20 029 cases of notifiable infectious diseases, the death of 43 people. Among them, the Group reported no cases of infectious diseases. Class B infectious diseases, in addition to SARS, polio, highly pathogenic avian influenza, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, anthrax, diphtheria, leptospirosis, schistosomiasis incidence, and deaths foreign reports, the remaining 17 kinds of infectious disease cases were reported in 10 210 cases, 43 deaths; reported incidence of the top 5 diseases were: tuberculosis, syphilis, viral hepatitis, gonorrhea, measles, accounting for reported cases of class B infectious diseases 94.1 per cent of the total.

During the same period, the province's class C infectious diseases were reported with 9819 cases and no deaths.

[While there is no specific mention of H7N9 in the announcement above, Sanders tracked down the strain identity. There is no indication of new cases of H7N9 in Guangdong province where most of cases reported earlier in the season (2014-2015) occurred, or were reported.

Of the 10 cases, 2 were previously included in the count by FluTrackers. Therefore, the total number of cases is now 654 since 2013 (27 deaths in 2015) (https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/china-h7n9-outbreak-tracking/143874-flutrackers-2013-15-human-case-list-of-provincial-ministry-of-health-government-confirmed-influenza-a-h7n9-cases-with-links). We are now seeing a release of reports of H7N9 after a lull of about 1 month. It appears people continue to be sickened by handling infected chickens; there is no evidence that the virus spreads easily from person to person. - Mod.LK]

[2] China (Hong Kong): avian influenza human downgrading alert status

Serious influenza response stands down
--------------------------------------
The Government today (8 Apr 2015) lowered the response level of the Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic from "Serious" to "Alert".

The response level was raised to "Serious" upon the detection of the 1st confirmed human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in winter, imported from the Mainland on 27 Dec 2014. Since then Hong Kong has so far recorded 3 confirmed cases, which were all imported. The latest case was confirmed on 23 Feb 2015. The surveillance system of local public and private hospitals has not detected any new cases for more than a month.

A spokesman for the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health said that the "Alert" response level was activated in view of the ongoing activity of highly pathogenic avian influenza among poultry outside Hong Kong.

"We will continue to closely monitor the global situation of avian influenza. So far, there is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission," the spokesman added.

Members of the public are advised to stay vigilant and maintain good personal and environmental hygiene, including washing hands frequently, particularly after sneezing or coughing; maintaining good indoor ventilation; building up good body immunity by having a balanced diet, regular exercise and adequate rest; and avoiding smoking.

[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government wrote a preparedness and response plan in case of an influenza pandemic. It defines the response levels, the corresponding command structures to be set up, and measures to be taken having regard to the development of the pandemic situation at each response level. The plan was updated in 2014 and can be found on-line as "Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (2014)." (http://www.chp.gov.hk/files/pdf/erib_preparedness_plan_for_influenza_pandemic_2014_eng.pdf)

Since the last imported case of H7N9 from Mainland China was reported 23 Feb 2015, the government feels it is safe for the alert status to be lowered from 'Serious' to 'Alert'. The highest level of response is 'Emergency'. The difference in response between the levels can be seen in the plan at the URL above.
