During the 1st 9 months of 2011, 42 outbreaks of animal rabies have
been reported in 15 districts of the Tver Oblast [Region]:
Tver city (6 outbreaks), Konakovski rayon [district] (9), Kalyazinski
district (5), Kalininski and Kashinski districts (4 outbreaks each),
Zubtsovski district (3), Staritski district (2), and the Bejetsk,
Zapadnodvinski, Kimrski, Kuvshinovski, Nelidski, Ostashkovski,
Remeshkovski, Selijarski, and Toropetski districts with single
outbreaks.

The infected animals included foxes (14), raccoon dogs (6), a lynx, a
wild boar, a ferret, 11 dogs and 8 cats. In all, 4169 people have
sought medical treatment [post-exposure prophylaxis] due to the risk
of rabies virus infection.

In 2011, 3 out of the 10 [fatal human] cases in Russia have occurred
in the Tver region. One case was the result of a bite by a rabid dog,
and the other 2 followed bites by raccoon dogs. 2 of the rabies cases
did not seek medical help and the other sought medical help too late.

[Tver Region (Tverskaya Oblast) is a federal subject of the Russian
Federation, part of the Central Federal District. The city of Tver is
the administrative centre and capital city of the region. A map of the
Tver Region can be found at http://russiatrek.org/tver-oblast.

The raccoon dog (_Canis procyonoides_) is now widespread in northern
and eastern Europe as well as in its native East Asian countries.
Although this species looks much like the North American raccoon
(_Procyon lotor_), the raccoon dog is not closely related to the
raccoon, and only distantly related to domestic dogs. Unique among
canids, the raccoon dog will hibernate during cold winters. An image
