As of 6 Jun 2017, a 4th outbreak of bird flu was confirmed in a poultry farm in Rollingen/Mersch. All poultry present on the premises have been euthanized.

In order to avoid spread of the disease to other livestock farms, all transport of live poultry and any exposure of poultry remains prohibited. Exceptionally, the transport of poultry directly to the slaughterhouse or from abroad to a holding may be authorized. This transport is subject to prior individual authorization from the Veterinary Services Administration (contact: 247-82539 / <info@asv.etat.lu>).

As already announced in the press release of 2 Jun 2017:
- It is recommended that poultry be kept indoors. All feeding and watering must be done inside the buildings.
- Any suspicion of avian influenza (abnormal mortality, reduced consumption of food or water, sudden drop in egg laying) should be reported to a veterinarian.
- Poultry industry professionals are reminded to respect biosecurity measures such as:
Limiting the access of people to livestock;
Wearing work clothes;
Regular cleaning and disinfection of infrastructure and equipment as well as means of transport in contact with live poultry.

[According to FAO's EMPRES Global Animal Disease Information System (EMPRES-i), 3 earlier avian influenza outbreaks affecting poultry in Luxembourg have been confirmed by the National Authorities as HPAI H5N8 (see http://empres-i.fao.org/eipws3g/; go to "Latest Events," 2 Jun 2017). The initial press release from Luxembourg, dated 2 Jun 2017, as cited by the media, was presented in ProMED post 20170602.5080342. This is Luxembourg's 1st event of avian influenza reported since 1956. According to article 1.1.3 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, such events should be reported to the OIE by the "Veterinary Authorities" of the involved country "within 24 hours." This should be done "through the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), or by fax or email."

HPAI H5N8 continues its circulation globally, though it should already have seasonally peaked. According to a media report from Zimbabwe, dated Mon 5 Jun 2017, a major poultry producer there has been hit by the virus, leading to the prescribed destruction of 140 000 birds (see https://www.thezimbabwedaily.com/local-news/141051-avian-influenza-outbreak-hits-irvines.html). - Mod.AS
