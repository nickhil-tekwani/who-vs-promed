On 20 Apr 2012, the Royal Kingdom of Bhutan reported a new outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), bringing Bhutan's total to 11 outbreaks so far in 2012, the USDA reported.

The outbreak occurred in a backyard poultry flock in Yangbari village, Mongar district. This was previously reported by the Bhutanese press on 11 Apr 2012.

On 9 Mar 2012, Bhutan reported its 10th outbreak to the OIE. The outbreak occurred in a backyard poultry flock in the Burkey area of Chhukha district. One bird was reported dead, and 131 birds were destroyed. Chhukha district has experienced more HPAI findings than any other Bhutanese district.

The government of Bhutan is taking measures to contain spread of avian influenza. These include quarantine, movement control, clean-up and disinfection of the contaminated premises, and culling.

According to USDA, as of 20 Apr 2012, the 11 outbreaks in Bhutan had involved 7133 birds, of which 370 had died and 5642 were culled. The presence of the H5N1 sub-type of the virus has been confirmed in each outbreak.

[Bhutan's 7 OIE reports on the ongoing epizootic since 9 Jan 2012, namely an immediate notification and 6 follow-up reports, including an interactive map showing the respective locations of the 11 outbreaks, are available on-line at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11465.

The 6th (last) follow-up report of 20 Apr 2012 included the following epidemiological comments: "One carcass tested positive to real-time PCR on 5 Apr [2012]. However, subsequently, 16 samples from the affected and nearby villages tested negative to H5N1. Clinical and laboratory surveillance within a 3-km radius showed no new cases. Therefore, at this stage, this could be a suspected H5N1 outbreak." - Mod.AS
