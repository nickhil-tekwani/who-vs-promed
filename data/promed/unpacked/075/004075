----------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent posting from Australia suggests that Kunjin Virus (KUN)
infection is similar to Ross River fever. Actually, KUN is more
closely related to yet another mosquito-borne virus in this country.
The following is abstracted from Gideon:

Kunjin virus (KUN) is similar [to] Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE)
virus; however, infection by KUN is generally milder than that with
MVE, with a lower rate of encephalitis. KUN appears to have been
responsible for some of the Murray Valley encephalitis cases reported
in 1974, and was implicated in an additional sporadic case in
northern Victoria in 1984. KUN is more widely distributed than MVE,
and is found in most of tropical Australia, eastern Queensland, and
occasionally southeastern Australia.

A graph depicting Kunjin virus incidence and rates per 100 000
population can be seen at

Notes for individual years:
1996: 2 cases in Queensland
1997: 2 cases in Western Australia and two in Northern Territory. A
presumptive case of KUN was reported in Pilbara, WA
2000: 3 cases in Western Australia and 1 in Northern Territory
2001: New South Wales, Northern Territory [2 cases] and Western Australia
2003: All cases reported from Queensland
2004: 11 cases in Queensland and 1 in Victoria
2005: 1 case in Queensland
2006: 2 cases in Western Australia and 1 in Queensland

The vectors for KUN are _Culex annulirostris_, _Cx. pseudovishnui_,
and _Cx. squamosis_.
