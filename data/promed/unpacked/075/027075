AFRICAN HORSE SICKNESS - SENEGAL: SEROTYPE 2

On Mon 11 June 2007, we received samples derived from horses in
Senegal that supposedly died from African horse sickness on 4 Jun
2007. The samples were submitted by Dr Thiongane of LNERV-ISRA
(National Laboratory for Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Research-Senegalese Institute of Agricultural Research), Dakar.
Virus from 2 horses was isolated in suckling mice. Double stranded
RNA extracted from infected mouse-brain showed typical AHSV (African
horse sickness virus) patterns on one percent agarose gels. We
amplified the cDNA of the complete genome and sequenced S2 (VP2)
partially.
Comparison of the VP2 sequence to the VP2 sequences of all 9
serotypes showed clearly that the virus is of AHSV genotype 2.
Phylogenetic analysis of AHSV2 isolates from South Africa, Botswana,
and Nigeria (2006) showed that the Senegal isolate is almost
identical to the AHSV2 isolates from all these countries. There are
significant differences between the Senegal isolate and the AHSV2
live-attenuated strain (OBP-Onderstepoort Biological Products). We
compared the amplified cDNA of the genomes of the Lagos isolate to
that of the Senegal isolate using PAGE (polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis). The patterns of cDNA from these viruses were almost
identical. The 9 reference strains of AHSV were included as controls
and none of the patterns of the reference viruses were similar to
that of the Senegal isolate.
We therefore conclude that the outbreak in Senegal was caused by
AHSV2. As for the origin we can only speculate that the virus may
have moved from the outbreak in Lagos (January 2006). [See references
below. - Mod.AS]
The fact that AHSV outbreaks are moving ever closer to Europe is of
great concern especially with outbreaks of other orbiviruses with the
same insect vectors already established in Europe and North Africa.

[We are grateful for this firsthand authoritative information from
the AHS reference laboratory in South Africa.
According to Senegal's annual reports to the OIE (World Organization
for Animal Health), confirmed clinical cases of AHS occurred during
those years. Hopefully, other African countries will follow Senegal
by submitting to reference laboratories field-collected samples for
confirmation and subtyping. - Mod.AS
