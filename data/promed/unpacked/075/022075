A young man of 21 years is in a serious state and admitted to the
Temuco Regional Hospital, in Chile's Araucania southern region. The
youth might have been infected with [a] hantavirus after having gone
to work at a recreational center in the Pucon municipality. The
patient came to hospital with severe stomach and chest pains, so it
is possible that he has the virus, according to Radio Bio Bio.

The Institute of Public Health will carry out thorough tests to
confirm the [cause of the] student's illness.

[The symptoms reported above are not specific for hantavirus
infections. ProMED would be grateful for information confirming the
etiology of this case. If this is a case of hantavirus infection, it
is the 2nd one in the Araucania region since the beginning of this
year (2010), and is likely due to Andes virus. As is usually the
case, unfortunately these reports speak of "hantavirus" as though
there is only one species, when in fact, there are a significant
number of different hantaviruses in South America that infect humans.
