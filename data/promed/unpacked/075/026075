The majority of these patients are from Sarlahi district (Hariyon-11). According to them, there is construction work (Hariyon-11) going on nearby its surrounding area, probably making a favorable environment for mosquito breeding. Dengue was 1st reported in Lalitpur district in early September (this year, 2016) in Nepal [ProMED-mail archive http:// www.promedmail .org/post/ 20160912.4481482].

Currently, dengue has been detected from Sarlahi district, showing rapid geographic and demographic shifts (shifting from hilly, north, to lowland areas, south) in Nepal.

http://thehitavada.com/Encyc/2016/11/9/11-chikungunya,30-dengue-positive-patients-detected.aspx

Madhya Pradesh (Indore). 15 Nov 2016. On an average at least 300 patients admitted into private hospitals every month are suspected to have dengue fever, but not all of them are confirmed cases. While more than 3000 suspected dengue fever cases have been reported by city hospitals, only 109 were found confirmed in the last 10 months, according to health department records. http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/indore/Suspected-dengue-cases-high-only-few-confirmed/articleshow/55432386.cms

New Delhi. 28 Nov 2016. The civic authorities in Delhi have updated the official dengue toll in the city to 6, even as there was a slight rise in the number of cases of chikungunya over the last week. The South Delhi Municipal Corporation has updated the death tally for dengue from 4 to 6, according to a report released by the SDMC today [28 Nov 2016]. As per the report, 135 fresh dengue cases were reported in the national capital last week. 4200 cases were recorded till 26 Nov 2016.

New Delhi. 21 Nov 2016. Chikungunya cases continued to fall in the national capital, while dengue showed a slight rise in the past week, with the total number of people affected by the vector-borne disease crossing 4000 this season. Last year [2015], out of the 15 867 dengue cases, 7283 were reported in October 2015, the highest in the season. Also, September last year had seen 6775 cases but only 1362 cases were reported this September [2016]. At least 21 deaths due to dengue have been reported at various hospitals, including 9 at AIIMS, though the civic bodies said only 4 persons died of the disease this season. http://www.siasat.com/news/chikungunya-cases-fall-delhi-dengue-crosses-4k-mark-1070357/

- New Delhi. November 2016. In 2015, the media reported, quoting surveillance data, that dengue fever, caused by a virus transmitted by mosquito bite, killed 60 people in Delhi. However, government of Delhi data on medically certified deaths, largely unknown to the media, reveal the dengue death toll to be 486, or 8 times the media estimate. It is now apparent that both figures are underestimates because even the mortality data source listed under what is called Report on Medical Certification of Cause of Death is confined to 62.7 percent of registered deaths in hospital settings during 2015 in Delhi, a city of 17 million that reliably registers all deaths. This means the dengue death toll was higher than 486 because domiciliary deaths, or deaths taking place at homes, which comprise the 37.3 percent outside hospitals, were not accounted for.

http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/33-new-dengue-cases-total-106/

- Nagaland (Dimapur). 14 Nov 2016. In an alarming rise in dengue cases, the Sentinel Surveillance Site Lab, District Hospital, Dimapur has confirmed 73 positive dengue cases out of 439 blood samples tested from October till 7 Nov 2016. According to reports, 21 samples were confirmed positive last Monday while 52 cases were tested positive some days earlier. The samples included collection from different private hospitals in and around Dimapur. This significant rise in the number of positive cases of dengue, which was only 8 as of 17 Oct 2016, is an indication that these are not sporadic cases. Recently, the Urban Vector-Borne Disease Control Scheme (UVBDCS) Dimapur suggested anti-dengue control measures by requesting the public and colony councils to observe a dry day social work once a week by draining all the water containers in order to control the mosquito population, which, it stated, would bring down the cases of dengue.

- Burkina Faso. 16 Nov 2016. A dengue fever outbreak in Burkina Faso isn't yet cause for alarm, health officials say, although it has now affected more than 1000 people in the nation's central region. Minister of Health Smaila Ouédraog said that as of 13 Nov 2016, there were 15 deaths among the 1061 probable cases reported. Health officials hope they are now seeing a downward trend, local media outlets report. In addition to Ouagadougou, suspected cases were reported in other provinces such as Dori, Bobo-Dioulasso and Boromo Kongoussi. However, Ouédraog -- while noting that he prefers to avoid a direct comparison -- has reminded citizens that malaria is more deadly than dengue in overall fatalities. The European Union has said international aid organizations are assisting Burkina Faso in assessing the dengue outbreak and informing the public about precautions and treatment. Meanwhile, Turkey has issued a travel warning to its citizens to use caution in the country and prevent dengue exposure.

Results for genetic sequencing are pending.
Public health response
- The Ministry of Health (MoH) has established an integrated disease surveillance and response (IDSR) mechanism but dengue surveillance was not included. There is a plan to include dengue to increase the surveillance capacity.
- An initial investigation was performed between 24 to 28 Oct 2016 into 6 health facilities, and further investigations are ongoing.
- Coordination is ensured by holding weekly meetings of the national epidemic management committee along with the health authorities and the other ministerial departments involved in the response.
- A response plan has been developed which includes vector control and risk communication.
- An update of dengue surveillance tools and guidelines for cases detection and management was carried out, and tools were disseminated to individuals in the response.
- The Ministry of Health plans to strengthen the capacity of the national reference laboratory for viral haemorrhagic fevers, with additional support being deployed by IPD and WHO.
- Delivery and dissemination of dengue awareness, case management, and preventive measures messages translated into different country's own official languages.
- The main hospitals in Ouagadougou are providing mosquito nets for the patients affected by severe dengue (for more information on severe dengue, see "Fact sheet on dengue").
- Free medical care and treatment for severe cases of dengue.

WHO risk assessment
----
Dengue has occurred in the context of low establishment of dengue surveillance in Burkina Faso. Many health facilities do not have access to dengue RDT. Case definitions and case management guidelines are not sufficiently disseminated, therefore healthcare workers are not well trained on dengue surveillance, specifically case detection and notification. Awareness of the disease among health care workers and prevention is lacking as the surveillance of this disease is not well established despite an IDSR mechanism.
