A cucumber grower from Bavaria has reported an infection in his greenhouse with the _Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV), the Julius KÃ¼hn Institute [JKI] has announced.

The virus, previously known mainly from the Mediterranean countries, was already detected in France in 1992 and more recently also in the Czech Republic and Ukraine. [It] could harm up to fifty percent of the crop in cucumbers.

Spread does not take place directly, but through aphids such as the melon aphid (_Aphis gossypii_), the green peach aphid (_Myzus persicae_) and the striped potato aphid (_Macrosiphum euphorbiae_).

[_Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus_ (CABYV; genus _Polerovirus_, Luteoviridae) affects primarily cucurbit crops (such as cucumber, zucchini, melons, pumpkins, squashes), but has also been reported from lettuce and beet. Symptoms may be confused with nutritional problems and vary with crops, cultivars and environmental conditions. They may include interveinal yellowing, thickening and brittleness of leaves, complete yellowing of whole plants and loss of plant vigour leading to reduced flowering and fruit production. Yield losses of up to 50 percent for cucumbers and 15 percent for melons have been reported.

The virus resides in phloem tissue and can be spread by several aphid species in a persistent manner. Different aphid species vary in their efficiency of CABYV transmission, with _A. gossypii_ being one of the most efficient. Infectious insects can be spread with plant material or carried on air currents for long distances. The virus cannot be transmitted mechanically or by seed. Weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management of aphid transmitted viruses is difficult and may include vector control, removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitation and cultural measures (such as barrier plantings).

The currently known luteoviruses are mostly important crop pathogens and include _Potato leafroll virus_, _Turnip yellows virus_, _Maize yellow mosaic virus_ and several barley yellow dwarf viruses (see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
