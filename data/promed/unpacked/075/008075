These two excerpts from the WHO website summarize the testing results
concerning the suspected Marburg/viral haemorrhagic fever in D. R. Congo in
April/May 1999:
<http://www.who.int/emc/outbreak_news/n1999/may/n20may1999.html>
>From Update 7, May 20, 1999
"Samples from only 9 cases have been available for testing. Three of the 9
patients tested have confirmed Marburg virus infection by antigen testing,
virus isolation and PCR. Specimens from all 3 patients with Marburg
infection were positive in all 3 assays. Samples from the other 6 patients
(66%) were negative by virus detection methods and antibody testing,
suggesting another etiology. All three confirmed cases of Marburg fever
have died, the latest being a miner who died on 13 May.
Blood samples from those living in the affected area and from health care
workers (total of approximately 1000 persons) have been collected. These
seroprevalence studies are expected to yield valuable information about the
epidemiology of Marburg virus infections in this outbreak of haemorrhagic
fever. Ecological studies to determine the reservoir of the Marburg virus
have begun."

<http://www.who.int/emc/outbreak_news/n1999/may/n28may1999.html>
>From Update 8, May 28, 1999
"The results of additional testing by the National Institute for Virology
(South Africa), now confirm 5 cases of Marburg fever. Samples from 10
suspected cases have been collected and tested. Three confirmed cases had
been reported previously."

Eight people have died of a deadly hemorrhagic fever in northeastern Congo
in what may be a resurgence of [the Marburg disease] outbreak in May, the
government's health minister announced Friday. All eight victims
contracted the disease in Durba, about 400 miles northeast of Kisangani and
the site of the May outbreak of Marburg fever, Dr. Mamba Mashako told a
gathering of journalists and western diplomats.
Testing is still underway but health authorities believe the current cases
are a resurgence of the Marburg fever that killed more than 60 people.
"After a lull that might have led us to declare the epidemic over, new
cases have emerged,'' Dr. Florimomt Tshoko, a World Health Organization
official, said at the meeting.
A team from the Dutch branch of the medical aid group Medicins Sans
Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, was heading to Durba on Friday to
take blood samples for analysis at the National Institute for Virology in
South Africa and the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Mashako said.
The most recent victim, a Ugandan soldier, died last week, two days after
checking into a hospital near Durba. The others are believed to have died
in August and September.
Calling the situation "alarming,'' Mashako urged western nations friendly
with Uganda to ask it to close Durba's Dorugba gold mine, believed to be a
source of the disease. The area around Durba is controlled by
anti-government Congolese rebels who are allied with Uganda and Rwanda.
