[The writer is referring to the outbreak in Hubei Provence described in the
post of 14 Nov Archive 20031114.2822. - Mod.DK]
Regarding the second case, T-2 toxin (a trichothecene mycotoxin produced by
certain Fusarium species) has previously been associated with clusters of
acute food-borne illness in China. The clusters were associated with moldy
rice, and characterized by a high attack rate and rapid onset of
gastronintestinal symptoms. Symptoms were reported to have resolved within
12 hours, and no fatalities were reported in this case series.
Analysis of rice implicated in these cases found levels of T-2 toxin
ranging from 180-420 ppb. To put this potential dose into perspective,
when T-2 toxin has been detected in corn and rice in European samples, the
concentrations have ranged from 1.3-6 mcg/kg and 2.7-27 mcg/kg, respectively.
