West Nile virus-positive Crow and Mosquito Pool in Baltimore
------------------------------------------------------------
BALTIMORE: The Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH)
Laboratories Administration has confirmed that a mosquito pool has tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). In addition, another bird has tested
positive for WNV in Baltimore County. The positive bird, a crow, was found
in the unit block of Henry Avenue is the ninth for Baltimore County, bring
the number total to 25.
The WNV mosquito pool was found in the 3200 block of Gibbons Avenue in
Northeast Baltimore City. A pool of 6 _Culex salinarius_ mosquitoes was
collected on 11 Jul 2001 using a Centers For Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) trap and received at the DHMH lab on 13 Jul 2001. An examination of
mosquito pools, a grouping of 1 to 40 mosquitoes, is part of the CDC WNV
surveillance program.
"We are not surprised that a mosquito pool has tested positive because we
have found a high number of positive birds in that region," said DHMH Deputy
Secretary Arlene Stephenson. "Spraying at this time will not significantly
reduce the mosquito population because their numbers are very low at this
time. However, the residents of this area are the key to helping us slow the
potential spread of the virus," she said. "I am asking them to be
conscientious in eliminating the water in their yards where mosquitoes can
breed. Everyone pulling together can make the difference between a healthy
community and an at-risk one."
[The significance of this observation is two-fold. Firstly these are the
first WNV-positive mosquitoes reported in Maryland this year. Secondly the
species _Culex. salinarius_ has a broader host range than _Culex. pipiens_
(which almost exclusively feeds on birds) and therefore could serve as a
bridging vector between birds and mammals, thus placing humans at increased
risk. In 2000, circumstantial evidence suggested that _Culex salinarius_
was an important vector during the epidemic on Staten Island. - Mod.CP

West Nile Virus Surveillance Test Results
-----------------------------------------
As of 18 Jul 2001, twenty five (25) dead birds (of 570 tested) have tested
positive for West Nile Virus. Sixteen (16) were submitted from Baltimore
City and nine (9) were submitted from Baltimore County. All positive
specimens were crows.
One (1) horse sample was submitted and tested negative for West Nile virus.
Over 6000 mosquito pools, ranging in quantities of 1-40 mosquitoes, have
been submitted for West Nile virus testing. One pool of _Culex_salinarius_
from Baltimore City has tested positive for WNV, all others are negative.

First Case of West Nile Virus in New York City in 2001
------------------------------------------------------
HAUPPAUGE: Health officials reported the first cases of the West Nile virus
in New York City this year after they found 2 birds with the potentially
fatal disease. The state Department of Health confirmed on Thu 19 Jul 2001
that the virus was found in a live sparrow and a mosquito pool in Queens,
and in a dead blue jay in Staten Island.
In Long Island, dead crows were found with the virus between 29 Jun and 9
Jul 2001, said Clare Bradley, the County's Commissioner of Health Services.
"Residents should not be alarmed by these findings but should stay informed
and take steps to decrease their risk of being bitten by mosquitoes,"
Bradley said.

Crow Tests Positive for West Nile Virus in D.C.
-----------------------------------------------
An exotic mosquito species that potentially could carry several deadly viral
diseases, including West Nile virus, is multiplying rapidly in Prince
George's and Montgomery counties, according to Maryland's chief of mosquito
control. The Asian tiger mosquito (_Aedes albopictus_), first discovered in
Baltimore in 1986, has spread to 16 counties in Maryland, particularly along
the Eastern Shore. Tiger mosquito populations also have been growing rapidly
in the District and Virginia. While the species has not been known to spread
any major diseases, laboratory tests have confirmed it is an effective
carrier of West Nile virus, said Cyrus Lesser, chief of the mosquito control
division of the Maryland Department of Agriculture. Before the arrival of
the tiger mosquito, the only parts of Prince George's County that had high
mosquito infestation were areas near the flood plains, Mr. Lesser said. "Now
most residential areas of the county have a mosquito problem,"
Yesterday, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported
finding the first mosquito pool to test positive for the West Nile virus.
The virus was found in a pool of 6 _Culex salinarius_ mosquitoes collected
on 11 Jul 2001. The infected mosquitoes bring the state one step closer to
the likelihood of a human infection because mosquitoes carry the virus from
birds to humans. Some reports say the tiger mosquito also is the most
aggressive species in attacking humans. In Maryland, "we are concerned that
[the Asian tiger mosquito could be involved in the West Nile virus cycle,
and we are sampling and testing this species," Mr. Lesser said. In Asia, the
tiger mosquito has been known to carry dengue and Japanese encephalitis
viruses. Closer to home, in Florida, the mosquito has been found to carry
Eastern equine encephalitis virus, which affects humans and horses, and
usually occurs in Maryland in summer. Concerns about mosquito populations
have increased since the spread of West Nile virus. It is hard to control
the growth of the tiger mosquito, Mr. Lesser said, because it can breed just
about anywhere, including inside artificial containers, while other species
rely on heavy rainfall. "We have 63 species of mosquitoes in Maryland, and
almost all prefer ditches, swamps and marshes. The Asian tiger mosquito,
however, prefers small containers, like bamboo shoots, buckets, rain
gutters, and flower pots," he said. It was through artificial containers
(used rubber tires) that the mosquito is believed to first have entered the
United States. Rubber tires imported from Japan and other Asian countries
could have served as breeding grounds for the mosquitoes and entered the
United States at ports, including Baltimore, Mr. Lesser said.
Baltimore City, which has had most of the positive bird infections of West
Nile virus, also has a large population of the tiger mosquito, so named
because of the pattern of white stripes on its black body. Although no human
cases of West Nile virus have been found in the District, Maryland and
Virginia, health officials in the region told The Washington Times last
month that they expect to see a human infection this year, given the rapid
spread of the virus among birds. Since the year began, Baltimore has found
25 birds infected with the potentially deadly virus, with one [more?
infected crow reported yesterday.
The District also yesterday reported finding its first infected crow in
Northeast. Last year, 5 infected crows were reported in the District, but so
far no infected mosquitoes have been found. Mosquitoes, particularly those
of the _Culex pipiens_ variety, are known carriers of the virus. But the
population of _Culex pipiens_ has been remarkably low this year, Mr. Lesser
said. Populations of other species of mosquito also have fluctuated widely
in the area. While the heavy rainfall in May and June saw a sharp increase
in their numbers, their populations declined this month, Mr. Lesser said.
The tiger mosquito and West Nile virus are found predominantly in urban and
suburban areas. Conventional mosquito control efforts did not work with the
tiger mosquito, he said. "It is beyond the scope of mosquito control
agencies," he said, adding that there has to be a community effort to remove
possible breeding grounds for the mosquitoes.
Meanwhile, the crow that tested positive in the District was found on 10 Jul
2001 between the 1000 and 1500 block of Quincy Street in Northeast, D.C.
health officials said yesterday. Dr. Ivan C. A. Walks, chief health officer
for the District, said there is a need for integrated pest management to
control different varieties of mosquitoes found in the city. But Dr. Walks
said he did not expect to see a human case this year because the possibility
of a human infection is very low, and because of the District's efforts to
control the spread of the virus. "The District started early with
larviciding protocol and educated the public on not maintaining standing
water around their houses" among other things, he said. Dr. Walks said the
District has no plans to spray for mosquitoes in the area where the dead
bird was found.

First Report of West Nile Virus-positive Mosquitoes
--------------------------------------------------
As of 19 Jul 2001, The State Mosquito Management Program announced that for
the first time this year the State has found West Nile virus (WNV) in
mosquitoes in Connecticut from mosquitoes collected on 5 Jul 2001 at Sleepy
Hollow Park in the Springdale section of Stamford. The pool of mosquitoes
that tested positive in Stamford are a mosquito that is known to bite
people. The 2 other mosquito trap sites in Stamford (Cove Island Park and
Intervale Road) have all tested negative for WNV. All other mosquitoes
tested in Connecticut thus far are negative.

West Nile Virus Detected in Massachusetts
-----------------------------------------
BOSTON: The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) announced today
West Nile Virus (WNV) has been confirmed by the State Laboratory Institute
in an adult dead crow found July 22 [the day after tomorrow! in a wooded
area near Willow Pond in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts. The finding of WNV in
Massachusetts at this time is not surprising given that WNV has been found
in an increasing number of birds and mosquitoes in the New York and
Connecticut area.

Test Results - New In This Update:
Fifteen (15) more crows and 13 additional mosquito pools have tested
positive for West Nile virus (WNV). The crows were collected 27 Jun 2001 in
River Vale and 3 Jul 2001 in Hackensack and Englewood (Bergen County); 5 and
12 Jul in Maple Shade (Burlington); 8 Jul, 2 crows in Camden; 28
Jun in Lower Twp. (Cape May); 28 Jun in South Belmar and 3 Jul in Hazlet
(Monmouth); 29 Jun in East Brunswick, 8 Jul in South River, and 9 Jul in
South Plainfield (Middlesex); 2 Jul in Clifton (Passaic); and 9 Jul in
Scotch Plains (Union). The positive mosquitoes were found 3 Jul in Corbin
City (Atlantic); 3 Jul in Upper Saddle River (Bergen), 6 Jul in Centerton
(Salem); and 10 pools collected between 28 Jun and 11 Jul 2001 in Ocean Twp
(Monmouth).
Cumulative Crow, Hawk & Falcon Testing:
To date, 337 birds, mostly crows, have been accepted for testing by the
Department of Health and Senior Services' Public Health and Environmental
Laboratory. Of those tested, 34 crows found in Bergen (4), Burlington (1),
Camden (3), Cape May (1), Mercer (1), Middlesex (15), Monmouth (5), Morris
(1), Passaic (1), and Union (1) Counties have been confirmed positive for
the presence of WNV.
Mosquito Testing:
To date, 29 mosquito pools collected in Atlantic (1), Bergen (1), Middlesex
(3), Monmouth (18), Morris (5) and Salem (1) Counties have tested positive
for the presence of WNV. In total, 906 mosquito pools have been tested.

Human Testing:
In total, 20 residents have been approved for WNV testing and 19 have
accepted. Blood and/or spinal fluid samples from these individuals have been
or are in the process of being tested for the presence of WNV. These
individuals either had symptoms or signs that met the established WNV
testing criteria or exhibited most of the symptoms and are from counties
where dead crows and/or mosquitoes with the virus have been discovered. To
date, testing has shown that 5 individuals were not infected with WNV and
results are pending for 14 others.
