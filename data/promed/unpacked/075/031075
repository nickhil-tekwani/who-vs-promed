The World Health Organization (WHO) has suspended the use of a
hepatitis B vaccine worldwide after 3 newborns died and another
became seriously ill in Viet Nam after getting shots in the last few
weeks. Nguyen Tran Hien, head of a council set up in Viet Nam to
investigate the cases, told the council's 1st meeting that 2
international experts from WHO would arrive in Viet Nam on Saturday
[19 May 2007] to work with local investigators.
The cases occurred between 23 Apr and 7 May 2007 in Ho Chi Minh City,
Ha Tinh Province, and Thanh Hoa Province. One baby fully recovered
after taking ill.
The WHO-approved vaccine is made by South Korea's LG Life Sciences
and distributed in Viet Nam through a UN program. Earlier this month
[May 2007], Viet Nam instructed all localities nationwide to stop
using the vaccine. WHO's Department of Immunization, Vaccines and
Biologicals has asked that countries around the world stop using
shots from the affected batches until the cause of the illness can be
determined.
