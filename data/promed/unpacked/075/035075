Sandusky County reports case of Eastern equine encephalitis in Ohio
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A case of Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) has been confirmed in the
death of a horse on a farm in Sandusky County, the Sandusky County
Health Department reported Tuesday [28 Sep 2010].

The disease, commonly called sleeping sickness, can be spread to
humans, according to the report, though there are no known human
illnesses associated with this confirmation of the disease. There have
been occasional cases of the disease in Ohio since a large outbreak
occurred in horses in 1991 in Wayne and Holmes counties.

The disease is caused by a virus that can infect birds, horses and
humans, the department reported, and is transmitted by mosquitoes.
Typically, outbreaks of EEE occur in late summer and early fall when
mosquitoes are most abundant.

The Sandusky County Health Department wants to warn residents that,
although it is rare for humans to contract the disease, they should
take steps to avoid mosquito bites. Wearing light-colored clothing,
long-sleeved shirts, long pants, socks and shoes can all help prevent
getting bit by mosquitoes carrying EEE. The health department also
recommends insect repellents used according to their label directions.

Infected horses can experience symptoms including paralysis, impaired
vision, difficulty swallowing, hanging their heads and grinding their
teeth. According to the health department, infected horses usually die
within 3 to 5 days after showing symptoms of the disease.

An effective vaccine does exist for horses, and the health department
asks horse owners to have their animals vaccinated for EEE and other
mosquito-borne diseases. Owners who suspect their horse might have the
disease should report the case to local veterinarians and the Ohio
Department of Agriculture. Any suspected human cases should be
reported to the local health department.

Humans can also contract West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis and
La Crosse encephalitis from mosquitoes. Mosquitoes stay active and can
transmit viruses, according to the health department, until the first
frost.

[The vaccine for horses is often combined with vaccines for other
equine encephalitis diseases and with West Nile virus. Horse owners
may find it helpful to use a spray or wipe-on product that the label
indicates is approved for flies and mosquitoes on horses. - Mod.TG]
