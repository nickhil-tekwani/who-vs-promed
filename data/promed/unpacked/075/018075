An outbreak of a contagious horse infection called strangles has closed the Shelburne Exhibition Grounds and at least one South Shore stable.

On 27 Apr 2016, Double J Stables in Welshtown wrote on its Facebook page that it was "closed to horse and people until further notice." On 2 May 2016, it wrote: "We have confirmed a case of strangles. ... Our barn is closed until further notice." On 7 May 2016, it cancelled all events and programs scheduled for May 2016.

The exhibition grounds posted that it was closed to the public until 19 May 2016 because of the strangles diagnosis.

"No horses will be permitted to come or go from the grounds. If a horse is removed from the grounds, it will not be permitted back until reopened," manager Burke Harris wrote on Facebook. Both the barn and the grounds declined to talk to CBC's Information Morning.

Dr Alison MacKay-Lyons treats horses at the South Shore Veterinarian Hospital in Bridgewater. She said strangles is a "highly contagious bacteria" that can easily pass from horse to horse. It can also spread on human clothing. "Strangles is a bacterial infection caused by _Streptococcus equi_," she said. "It typically infects the airway and the lymph nodes of the head and neck of the horse."

Signs are:
- Fever over 39.5 C [103 F]
- Enlarged lymph nodes in the head and neck of the horse
- Depression
- Difficulty breathing
- Difficulty swallowing

Nova Scotia last saw an outbreak 2 years ago. "We don't see it that often, but when we do, we usually see a handful of cases," said MacKay-Lyons." The respiratory condition can progress, and sometimes we need to put them on IV antibiotics for a week."

Often a horse without signs spreads the infection. Infected horses often get sick but rarely die. There is a vaccine for strangles, but that carries other risks, so it's given on a case-by-case basis.

The veterinarian said the stable should limit transportation and quarantine the horses for 6-9 weeks.

"We really don't want any of these horses moving to other areas of the province, which is really quite challenging for horse owners," MacKay-Lyons said. "Everyone is just getting geared up for competition season."

Strangles normally poses no danger to humans.

[The organizers are acting prudently to protect equine health, as this is a contagious disease. But another question might be, why would someone take a sick animal to an event? Of course, the disease could be incubating and the owner/rider might not know it.

Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of Equidae characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_, is highly host-adapted and produces clinical disease only in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a Gram positive, capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group (serologically distinguishable groups into which most streptococci can be divided and which are based on the polysaccharide antigens present in the cell walls) C coccus, which is an obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease. Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days and the 1st sign of infection is fever (103-106 F / 39.4-41.1 C). Within 24-48 hours of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge, depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever. Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax. The affected horses are quite uncomfortable.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed with dilute (3-5 per cent) povidone-iodine solution for several days until discharge ceases. NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression, but ultimately prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses. Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia, prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia (loss of appetite). Administration of penicillin during the early stage of infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000 IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of choice.

Sharing of halters and brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread the disease to other horses.
