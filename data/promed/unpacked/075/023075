The Miyazaki prefectural government is set to lift its last remaining
ban on transfers of animals Monday [26 Jul 2010] midnight, leaving the
prefecture free from any restrictions on moving livestock, more than 3
months after the 1st case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was
confirmed in southwestern Japan.

Miyazaki Governor Hideo Higashikokubaru plans to issue a declaration
of safety with the lifting of the ban after the epidemic severely hit
local livestock farming, forcing the prefecture to slaughter about 289
000 pigs and cows to contain the disease.

The spread of the epidemic led to temporary closures of public
facilities and cancellations of sports and other public events, while
the prefectural government asked residents in the affected and
surrounding areas to refrain from going out unless absolutely necessary.

Last week [week of 19 Jul 2010], the local government started having
vets conduct visual checks on most of the roughly 940 000 livestock in
the prefecture before it declares an official end to the epidemic in
late August [2010], when excreta disposals will be completed at the
farms affected by the epidemic.

The 1st confirmed case of FMD was reported in the town of Tsuno on 20
Apr 2010 before it spread to 11 municipalities, including Miyakonojo
city, one of Japan's biggest livestock centers.

Higashikokubaru declared a state of emergency on 18 May 2010 and
partially lifted the state of emergency rule on 1 Jul 2010 after all
animals in affected areas were culled.

The last suspected case of the epidemic was reported on 4 Jul 2010 at
a farm in the prefectural capital of Miyazaki. The area centering on
the farm is covered by the only remaining ban on animal transfers.

In related moves, the governments of Kumamoto and Oita prefectures,
which share borders with Miyazaki Prefecture, decided Monday [26 Jul
2010] to end before August [2010] the epidemic prevention measures
currently in place, including sanitization of vehicles at more than a
dozen places in each prefecture.

Livestock raised by more than 10 farmers in Miyazaki Prefecture had
been infected with FMD before the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Ministry detected the 1st infection case on 20 Apr 2010, according to
a ministry expert team.

According to the team, led by Tomoyuki Tsuda, head of the Department
of Planning and General Administration of the National Institute of
Animal Health, the 1st infection is now confirmed to have been at a
water buffalo farm in Tsunocho in the prefecture in mid-March [2010].
The Tsunocho case initially was thought to have been the 6th of its
kind. The team believes effective initial response measures against
the disease were stymied as a result of the detection delay of the
real 1st case.

The team researched all 292 Miyazaki Prefecture farmers whose
livestock were infected to find the routes and timelines of the
infection by conducting antibody tests and other methods. An interim
report will be compiled in mid-August [2010].

[Information on the buffalo farm suspected to be the index case of the
Japanese FMD epizootic, was included in ProMED-mail postings
20100605.1864, 20100722.2456, and 20100606.1890. The following RFI,
posted on 5 Jun 2010, is still valid:

"According to the OIE follow-up report number 1, submitted 23 Apr
2010, the 1st case had started already on 26 Mar 2010, in the farm
'Tsuno-cho Koyu-gun 1, Miyazaki'. The farm included 42 susceptible
buffaloes and 2 swine, among which only one case occurred (in a
buffalo). This case was diagnosed, by RT-PCR, on 23 Apr 2010, leading
to the culling of the entire farm's population (42 buffaloes and 2
swine) on 25 Apr 2010 (see outbreak 5 in
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=9167>).

"Objectively, a single, solitary sick water buffalo showing "fever and
diarrhea" is not usually expected to become subject to suspicion of
FMD. It remains to be known if this animal showed other, more typical
signs, such as oral lesions or lameness. Even if some oral lesions
were seen, such (mucosal) signs could have been mistaken for a (rare)
complication of bovine virus diarrhea (BVD), a globally distributed
pestiviral disease. Additional details on the said buffalo, including
its age, will be helpful.

"Most important, in particular for lessons to be drawn, is the
question: how and from where did the virus (which circulates in China
and South Korea) get into this Tsuno farm in the 1st place?"

For a description of FMD in water-buffaloes and an illustrated
reference, see commentary to item 1 in ProMED-mail archive no.
20100606.1890.

Hopefully, the team investigating the epizootic will manage to obtain
the afore-mentioned missing information and include it in the expected
report. - Mod.AS]
