Anthrax ID'd as cause of Oregon steer's death
- -------------------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed as the cause of death in a Klamath County steer and is suspected in the deaths of two others from the same herd, state officials said Friday.

Outbreaks of naturally occurring anthrax do occur in the West, but this is Oregon's first anthrax case involving an animal in more than five decades, said Brad Leamaster, a state veterinarian.

The Oregon steer with anthrax died Aug. 22 at a ranch near Fort Klamath. [Necropsies] were not performed on the [two] other dead cattle. The state Department of Agriculture said the outbreak has been isolated to one herd, and the surviving cattle will be vaccinated and monitored. The agency quarantined the ranch, and the animals were buried 10 feet underground.

Agriculture Department spokesman Bruce Pokarney said ranchers vaccinated their livestock against anthrax in past decades, but might have become less vigilant because the disease has been dormant for so long. "This may change all that again," he said.

The outbreak does not pose a public health risk, said Dr. Paul Cieslak of the Oregon Health Authority. People who handle infected animals have a slight chance of getting anthrax through scratches in the skin. Ranch workers who develop skin infections should seek medical help. "The people who dealt with the (Klamath) cows would have shown symptoms by now," Cieslak said. "We think they're out of the woods."

[This is essentially just a rewrite of an Oregon Health Authority news release of August 31st; see: http://cms.oregon.gov/ODA/pages/index.aspx.

Speculatively the index case was necropsied and with a suspected diagnosis of "anthrax" the other two carcasses were not opened, and all three were buried deeply. Such cases do not appear out of nowhere. Usually recurrences occur following earth moving in relation an old 'anthrax;' grave. But as the Colorado outbreak has demonstrated after vaccination stopped without an obvious immediate recurrence of cases, later dead cows were ignored and just dragged off into rough ground to rot. The cause of this reappearance must await investigation by the State Veterinarian.

The Oregon veterinarians are to be congratulated on recognising this disease after an absence of five decades. I hope that the vaccination of this herd is not delayed. They are very lucky if there have not been more cases since August 22nd. This herd will need to be revaccinated for the next five years to prevent any more cases from this new 'old' souce. -Mod MHJ
