Two More Staten Island Residents Test Positive For West Nile Virus
-------------------------------------------------------------------
New York City Health Commissioner Neal L. Cohen, M.D., announced today that
a 64 year-old woman and a 63 year-old man, both residents of Staten Island,
tested positive yesterday for West Nile virus (WNV) at the New York City
Department of Health's laboratories. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and the New York State Department of Health will
conduct additional confirmatory tests over the next week. Yesterday, the
CDC confirmed West Nile virus in the 78 year-old Staten Island man whose
illness was announced on 4 Aug 2000.
The 64 year-old woman who lives in Great Kills, Staten Island, became ill
with symptoms of meningitis on 4 Aug, and was admitted to a local hospital
on 6 Aug. The 63 year-old man who lives in Willowbrook, Staten Island,
became ill with symptoms of meningitis on 31 Jul, and was admitted to a
local hospital on 5 Aug. Both individuals were infected before the City
implemented its most recent spraying efforts on Staten Island. Both
individuals are now at home recovering.
Dr. Cohen said, "With three Staten Island residents, ages 63, 64, and 78
years-old, testing as laboratory-positive for West Nile virus in 2000, it
is critical that all New Yorkers, particularly the elderly and those who
live on Staten Island, take precautions to reduce exposure to mosquitoes.
Residents are urged to wear protective clothing, such as long pants,
long-sleeved shirts, and socks, if outside during hours when mosquitoes are
active and most likely to bite and are also urged to reduce standing water
around their homes since the mosquitoes carrying the virus tend to breed in
backyards".
Dr. Cohen stated that: "The entire borough of Staten Island was sprayed for
adult mosquitoes most recently on August 2. With symptoms of West Nile
virus beginning 3 - 15 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito, it
indicates that both individuals were infected before the City implemented
its most recent adult mosquito control efforts. However, given the
significant West Nile viral activity documented on Staten Island over the
past month, and with the re-emergence of mosquitoes following previous
spraying efforts, the entire borough of Staten Island will be sprayed
overnight on Monday, August 14, in an attempt to reduce the possibility of
additional human illnesses. Anvil (Sumithrin) will be used for these
efforts. This pyrethroid-based pesticide is relatively nontoxic to humans
and other mammals, and health risks associated with the use of pyrethroids
in accordance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and New York
State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) guidelines are
negligible".
For information on West Nile virus, spraying activities, or to report dead
birds and areas of standing water where mosquitoes breed, New Yorkers can
call the NYCDOH's West Nile virus information line, 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, at 1-877-WNV-4NYC (1-877-968-4692). (New Yorkers who use TTY/TDD
can call 212-788-4947 weekdays from 9:00a.m. to 5:00p.m.).
