Portsmouth "rogue" heroin claims 6th victim
-------------------------------------------
A suspected contaminated batch of heroin in the Portsmouth area has been blamed for a 6th person falling ill. The woman was hospitalised on Friday [3 May 2013] after using the drug. She was discovered by a member of the public who called an ambulance. Two men aged 33 and 36 have died and 3 others have been taken ill since Tuesday [30 Apr 2013].

Detectives are making inquiries into the suspected link between all the people and the same batch of heroin. Police said she [the latest victim who was hospitalised] might have died if she had not been treated.

A 33 year old man from Fareham, who had been in a critical condition in hospital, died on Thursday [2 May 2013]. On Wednesday [1 May 2013] a 36 year old man who had been taken ill at an address in Paulsgrove also died.

Two men aged 32 and 48 have been arrested on suspicion of supplying a class-A drugs, a police spokesman said on Friday [3 May 2013].

[The previous BBC reports are:

"Second man dies from 'rogue' heroin"
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hampshire-22404422

The characteristics of the "rogue" matter have yet to be described by the UK police. But it is an unfortunate aspect of heroin to have lethal contaminants, latterly _Bacillus anthracis_, and not infrequently various clostridia.

All 6 cases were or are in Hampshire -- Portsmouth (2), Paulsgrove (2), Fareham (1), and Southsea (1), in the south of England (see the interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/1p4z), so it is likely that all were affected by the same batch of heroin. Further information from informed sources would be welomed. - Mod.MHJ]
