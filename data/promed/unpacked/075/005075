South Korea says 3rd bird flu case confirmed
--------------------------------------------
South Korea's agriculture ministry said on Monday [11 Dec 2006] it had
found a 3rd case [I think this means "incident" or "outbreak". - Mod.SH] of
highly pathogenic bird flu in North Cholla province south of Seoul.
Last month [November 2006], South Korea confirmed its 1st 2 outbreaks of
the H5N1 strain in about 3 years, saying the virus had been found at 2
poultry farms close to each other in North Cholla province.
The 3rd case was discovered at a quail farm in the same province about 170
km (100 miles) south from Seoul, some 18 km from the original outbreak,
according to the ministry. "The case has been confirmed as the H5N1 strain
of avian influenza," the ministry said in a statement, adding thousands of
birds at the farm had died over the past 4 days.
The fresh case emerged after South Korea had completed culling all 760 000
poultry near the 2 farms already discovered to have been infected with H5N1.
Between December 2003 and March 2004, about 400 000 poultry at South Korean
farms were infected by bird flu.
During that outbreak, the country destroyed 5.3 million birds, and
subsequent testing in the United States indicated at least 9 South Korean
workers involved in the culling had been infected with the H5N1 virus, but
none developed major illnesses.

A follow-up report, covering the measures undertaken in the 1st outbreak

Experts puzzle over halt of bird flu
------------------------------------
Earlier this year [2006], bird flu panic was in full swing: The French
feared for their foie gras, the Swiss locked their chickens indoors, and
Americans enlisted prison inmates in Alaska to help spot infected wild birds.
The H5N1 virus -- previously confined to South East Asia -- was striking
birds in places as diverse as Germany, Egypt, and Nigeria, and a flu
pandemic seemed inevitable. Then the virus went quiet. Except for a steady
stream of human cases in Indonesia, the current flu epicenter, the past
year's worries about a catastrophic global outbreak largely disappeared.
Part of the explanation may be seasonal. Bird flu tends to be most active
in the colder months, as the virus survives longer at low temperatures.
"Many of us are holding our breath to see what happens in the winter," said
Dr Malik Peiris, a microbiology professor at Hong Kong University. "H5N1
spread very rapidly last year [2005-2006]," Peiris said. "So the question
is, was that a one-off incident?"
Some experts suspect poultry vaccination has, paradoxically, complicated
detection. Vaccination reduces the amount of virus circulating, but low
levels of the virus may still be causing outbreaks without the obvious
signs of dying birds.
"It's now harder to spot what's happening with the flu in animals and
humans," said Dr Angus Nicoll, influenza director at the European Centres
for Disease Control and Prevention. While the pandemic has not
materialized, experts say it's too early to relax. "We have a visible risk
in front of us," said Dr Keiji Fukuda, coordinator of the World Health
Organization's global influenza program. But although the virus could
mutate into a pandemic strain, Fukuda points out that it might go the other
direction instead, becoming less dangerous for humans.
H5N1 has primarily stalked Asia. This year [2006], however, it crossed the
continental divide, infecting people in Turkey, Iraq, Egypt, Djibouti, and
Azerbaijan.
But despite the deaths of 154 people, and hundreds of millions of birds
worldwide dying or being slaughtered, the virus still has not learned how
to infect humans easily. Flu viruses constantly evolve, so the mere
appearance of mutations is not enough to raise alarm. The key is to
identify which mutations are the most worrisome.
"We don't really know how many changes this virus has got to make to adapt
to humans, if it can at all," said Dr Richard Webby, a bird flu expert at
St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Tennessee.
The most obvious sign that a pandemic may be under way will almost
certainly come from the field: a sudden spike in cases suggesting
human-to-human transmission. The last pandemic struck in 1968, when bird
flu combined with a human strain and went on to kill one million people
worldwide.
In May 2006, on Sumatra island in Indonesia, a cluster of 8 cases was
identified, 6 of whom died. The World Health Organization immediately
dispatched a team to investigate. The UN agency was concerned enough by the
reports to put pharmaceuticals company Roche Holding AG on standby in case
its global antiviral stockpile, promised to WHO for any operation to quash
an emerging pandemic, needed to be rushed to Indonesia. Luckily, the
Sumatra cluster was confined to a single family. Though human-to-human
transmission occurred -- as it has in a handful of other cases -- the virus
did not adapt enough to become easily infectious.
This highlighted many of the problems that continue to plague public health
officials, namely, patchy surveillance systems and limited virus
information. Even in China, where H5N1 has circulated the longest,
surveillance is not ideal. "Monitoring the 14 billion birds in China,
especially when most of them are in back yards, is an enormous challenge,"
said Dr Henk Bekedam, WHO's top official in China. Of the 21 human cases
China has logged so far, 20 were in areas without reported H5N1 outbreaks
in birds. "We need to start looking harder for where the virus is hiding,"
Bekedam said.
To better understand the virus's activity, it would help to have more virus
samples from every H5N1-affected country. But public health authorities are
at the mercy of governments and academics. Scientists may hoard viruses
while waiting for academic papers to be published 1st.
And developing countries may be wary of sharing virus samples if the
vaccines that might be developed from them might ultimately be
unaffordable. That leaves public health officials with an incomplete viral
picture.
"It shouldn't just be WHO as a lonely voice in the desert, calling for more
viruses (to be shared)," said Dr Jeff Gilbert, a bird flu expert with the
Food and Agriculture Organization in Viet Nam. All countries need to
understand that sharing will help them better prepare for a flu pandemic,
he said.
Though scientists are bracing themselves for increased bird flu activity in
the winter, there are no predictions about where it might appear next. The
WHO's Fukuda said it would not be a surprise to see it appear in new countries.

[The decreased activity of the virus during the last semester is
graphically demonstrated in the last available update of WHO's map "Areas
reporting confirmed occurrence of H5N1 avian influenza in poultry and wild
birds since July 2006 (status as of 6 Dec 2006)." Visiting the said website
may allow comparing the recent situation with previous years, presented in
the other available maps.
Indeed, the coming winter months will show whether the H5N1 panzootic has
peaked or just seasonally decreased.
