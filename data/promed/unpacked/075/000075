Dengue fever in Indonesia
-------------------------
As of 26 Feb 2004, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia has reported a total
of 14 626 cases with 260 deaths (case fatality rate, 1.8 percent) from 1
Jan 2004 in all provinces in Java and 2 in Sumatra. Den-3 is the most
common serotype circulating, although all 4 serotypes are present. The
health authorities are carrying out tests to determine the specific virus
strain responsible for this outbreak.

The Ministry of Health has begun intensive space spraying to eliminate the
mosquitoes that carry the virus. WHO and the WHO Collaborating Centre,
NAMRU- 2 [Jakarta], are assisting the Ministry of Health with laboratory
diagnosis.

Indonesian President Megawati ordered hospitals to treat dengue fever
victims, irrespective of their ability to pay, as the death toll rose to 267.

"I call on all hospitals to accept dengue fever patients and treat them
without looking at their economic background. Let us face this threat
together," Megawati said in a speech broadcast nationwide over state-run
television.

Health Ministry data said indicates the outbreak has killed as many as 267
people in 22 of Indonesia's 32 provinces and sickened more than 15 000
others since the disease was first detected [during January 2004]. The
current outbreak is the worst the country has experienced.

Most of the reported cases were on Java, Indonesia's most densely populated
island, where more than 60 percent of the country's 215 million people
live. The capital, Jakarta, with a population of nearly 12 million, has
been one of the worst hit areas; 5431 people have been hospitalized and 53
have died from the mosquito-borne viral disease.

For the last few weeks, dengue has been spreading in the northeast of
Peru. So far 1100 cases have been recorded, and at least 3 cases of DHF.

Localities affected are the departments of Lambayeque (north) and Pucallpa
(east, on the frontier with Brazil), which are classified as epidemic, and
Loreto (east), Tumbes (north, on the frontier with Ecuador), San Martin,
and Huanuco (northeast), classified as endemic.

The first outbreak of dengue in Peru was in 1990 in Iquitos, Tarapoto, and
Moyobamba, in the Amazon region. In 2000 & 2001 [combined?] there were 24
342 cases of dengue and 283 of DHF. In 2003, the numbers fell by 75 percent.
