[This outbreak was 1st reported on 11 Aug 2017. Two elephants and a kudu were affected. However, in this report, further species were affected including African buffalo, a bush duiker, and a lion. It is most likely that the predator acquired the disease while trying to eat some of the infected carcasses.

Very little is known about the epidemiology of anthrax in Mozambique. However, these 2 reports show some improvement in disease surveillance and reporting. - Mod.MMS
