Mosquito sample tests positive for West Nile virus in SE Arizona
----------------------------------------------------------------
A mosquito sample collected by Cochise County health officials in the San
Simon area has tested positive for the West Nile virus, marking the
emergence of the virus in the state. San Simon is located in south eastern
Arizona near the New Mexico border.
Although testing of specimens from birds, horses, sentinel chicken flocks,
and mosquito pools began in Arizona in May 2003, the mosquito sample in
Cochise County is the only one that has tested positive for West Nile
virus, so far. This year, the Arizona State Health Laboratory has tested
over 800 mosquito [pools?] and more than 900 chicken blood samples. In
addition, the University of Arizona Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory has
tested over 300 dead birds and more than 20 horses.
West Nile virus is not the only encephalitis-causing virus circulating in
Arizona this summer. St Louis encephalitis (SLE)-positive mosquito samples
and/or chicken blood samples were collected in Maricopa and Yuma counties,
and western equine encephalitis (WEE) positive samples were collected in
Apache, Maricopa, and Pinal counties.
To bolster the state's West Nile virus surveillance efforts, the Arizona
Department of Health Services today issued an emergency order making West
Nile virus a reportable disease. Under the order, a physician or an
administrator of a health care facility is required to submit a
communicable disease report of a case or a suspect case of West Nile within
24 hours of diagnosis to the local health agency. In addition, clinical
laboratories are required to report to the Department.

Arizona: First Report of West Nile Virus in the State
---------------------------------------------------
The potentially deadly West Nile virus has been detected for the first time
inside the state of Arizona -- one of the last states in the nation to be
hit. Found this weekend in mosquitoes in the far south eastern part of the
state -- about 120 miles from Tucson -- the virus is now expected to move
throughout Arizona. There have been no reports of the virus in [humans or
other vertebrates] in Arizona. But state health officials predict it will
hit horses and several humans within the next 3 months.
No one can predict at this point how soon it will enter Pima County,
however. "Our mosquitoes are still testing negative; we have no evidence of
infected birds," said Dr Elizabeth MacNeill, chief medical officer for Pima
County. "It's just really hard to say how this will move in the coming
weeks." Mosquito testing this weekend confirmed the virus made its Arizona
debut in the tiny rural town of San Simon, in Cochise County near the
Arizona-New Mexico border.
It is believed to have crossed in from New Mexico in late July 2003, when
the mosquitoes were collected, said Michael Fink, an epidemiologist for
vectorborne and zoonotic diseases in the Arizona Department of Health
Services. The virus had been detected in Silver City -- in south western
New Mexico about 45 miles from Arizona -- in mid-July 2003. In 2002, New
Mexico had no human cases of West Nile virus infection, but so far it has
reported 3 human victims this year. When it hit Silver City, the health
department sent out a special alert to counties on Arizona's eastern border
to start trapping mosquitoes in the rural regions, Fink said. "That is
exactly what Cochise County did, and sure enough, they found it," he said.
Mosquitoes become infected with the virus after biting sick birds -- the
source of the disease. It is transmitted to humans and horses though the
bites of the infected mosquitoes.
Along with Utah, Nevada, and Oregon, Arizona was one of only 4 states that
escaped any trace of West Nile infection in 2002, when it roared west
through most of the country, infecting more than 4000 people and killing
284. Health officials stated that: "It's in Farmington and Gallup (2 north
western New Mexico communities), and of course Colorado's been hit hard
this year, so we will likely see positives in Graham and Greenlee counties
next," Fink said.
"It's right on the border up there, too." If Arizonans want to see their
West Nile future, watch Colorado this year, Fink advised. Hit late and
lightly in 2002 -- with 14 human cases and no deaths -- Colorado is getting
slammed by West Nile this year, with 72 human cases and one death only
halfway through the summer.
