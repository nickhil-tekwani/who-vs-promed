----------------------------------------------------------------------
The following overview of hepatitis A in Australia was abstracted
from the Gideon database
(<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/2009/12/21/hepatitis-a-in-australia/>).

The incidence of hepatitis A in Australia has decreased dramatically
in recent decades -- from a high of 12 876 cases in 1962, to only 274
cases in 2008.

Since the 1970's, rates of hepatitis A in Australia have been
strikingly similar to those of the United States: see graph at
<http://www.gideononline.com/blog/wp/wp-content/uploads/hepatitis-Australia.PNG>

Graph notes
-----------
1. During 1991 to 1997, highest rates (52 per 100 000) were reported
in the Northern Territory.
2. During 1991 to 2006, rates in New South Wales declined from 18.9
per 100 000 to 1.4 per 100 000.

Individual years
----------------
1991: 46.7 percent from New South Wales.
1994-96: 39.7 percent from Northern Territory and 25.1 percent from Queensland.
1996: 45.6 percent from New South Wales.
1997: 47.3 percent from New South Wales.
1998: 44.9 percent from Queensland and 37.8 percent from New South Wales.
2005: 15.4 percent from Queensland and 25.5 percent from New South Wales.
2009: Increasing rates in Victoria and South Australia appear to have
been associated with ingestion of contaminated semi-dried tomatoes.

- No fatal cases were reported during 1991 to 1997.
- 8 during 1998 to 2000.

- 570 cases were reported from eastern Sydney during 1991 to 1992, of
which 58 percent were men who have sex with men [MSM].
- 236 cases were reported from south-eastern Sydney during June 1997
to May 1998 -- over 60 percent of male cases acquired through
homosexual contact.
- 118 during June 1998 to May 1999 -- 29 percent through homosexual contact.

Seroprevalence surveys
----------------------
- 41.1 percent of Australians, 68.8 percent in the Northern Territory (1998).
- 75 percent of HIV-positive MSM (2007 publication).
- 48 percent of homeless persons in Sydney (2003 to 2005).
- 3.0 percent of STD [sexually transmitted diseases] clinic patients
(Canberra, 2000 to 2002).
- 37 percent of prisoners in New South Wales (1994).

Since 1993, hepatitis A has been the most common cause of infectious
disease death among indigenous children in northern Queensland.
- Clinically apparent and severe hepatitis A are more common among
indigenous children than their non-indigenous counterparts.
- A vaccination program for this population was introduced in 1999.
- During 2003 to 2006, disease rates were 8.1 per 100 000 among
indigenous people vs 1.7 per 100 000 in other populations.

Notable outbreaks
-----------------
- 1970 (publication year): an outbreak of infectious hepatitis was
reported in an institution.
- 1980 (publication year): an outbreak (15 cases) was reported in a
home for mentally-retarded children in Sydney.
- 1991: an outbreak (495 cases) in Melbourne involved men who have
sex with men.
- 1993: an outbreak (11 cases) was reported at a center for young
people with developmental disabilities.
- 1996 (publication year): an outbreak (7 cases) at a hospital in
North Queensland may have been related to handling of contaminated bile.
- 1997: an outbreak (7 cases) occurred among boys using a domestic
spa in Melbourne.
- 1997: an outbreak (270 cases or more) in New South Wales was traced
to raw oysters.
- 1998: an outbreak (45 cases) in Sydney was ascribed to illicit drug use.
- 2003: an outbreak (10 cases) in Tasmania, Victoria, and Queensland
occurred among people who had been on tour in the Northern Territory.
- 2003: an outbreak (21 cases) at a youth camp in central Australia
was associated with ingestion of contaminated coleslaw.
- 2008: an outbreak (15 cases) was associated with a cafe in
Melbourne, Victoria.
- 2009: an outbreak (200 cases) in Victoria was associated with
consumption of semi-dried tomatoes.
