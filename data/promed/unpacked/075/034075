10 colonoscopy patients have hepatitis
--------------------------------------
Equipment used on thousands of patients [more than 10 000 -- see
comment below. - Mod.JW] at 3 facilities wasn't properly sterilized.
The Veterans Affairs (VA) department says 10 people have tested
positive [so far] for infectious liver disease since they were exposed
to contaminated colonoscopy equipment. The 10 are among thousands of
patients who have been warned to get blood tests since being treated
at VA facilities in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, Miami [Florida] &
Augusta, Georgia. All 3 sites failed to properly sterilize
equipment between treatments.

VA spokeswoman Katie Roberts said Friday [27 Mar 2009] that 4
Tennessee patients have tested positive for hepatitis B. A total of 6
have tested positive for hepatitis C, a potentially life-threatening
form of the viral infection that can cause permanent liver damage.

[The 10 identified hepatitis patients seem to have contracted
infection during examination by colonoscopy at the VA hospital in
Tennessee. The faulty procedure (inadequate sterilization of
equipment) seems to have been followed at the other 2 hospsitals,
although cases of hepatitis have not yet been reported. Blood-borne
transmission of infection should not be an accompaniment of any
hospital procedure. The precise number of patients exposed at each
hospital has not been disclosed. Further information would be
appreciated.

[The Miami VA notified about 3260 patients who received colonoscopies
between May 2004 and March 12 of this year [2009] that they may have
been exposed to hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV. It has suspended
colonoscopies. At the Murfreesboro hospital, 6400 veterans might have
been exposed, according to the VA. At the Augusta, Ga., VA hospital,
1100 veterans might have been exposed.
