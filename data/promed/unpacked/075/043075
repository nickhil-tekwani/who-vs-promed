Czech public health officials say _Listeria_ bacteria has spread to
more food products, killing 14 people across the country.
A recent outbreak of listeriosis originated in a Czech dairy plant,
whose production was stopped immediately, but the latest contaminated
food was bacon sold in the Litomerice region, Prague Radio reported
Tue 13 Feb 2007.
In January 2007, health officials said 13 people had died of
listeriosis in the Czech Republic. More than 90 people have fallen
ill with listeria infection during the past several months.
The strain of bacteria had been [identified] in soft cheese, salads,
and fish before it was recently found in bacon.

[It is not clear from this posting how many cases are new diagnoses
from 2007, since the last posting that reported on cases from 2006.
In that posting from Eurosurveillance, 75 cases were noted (now the
number is 90) with 12 deaths (now 14 are reported). It is also not
clear if the contaminated bacon has been shown to be
microbiologically linked to clinical cases.
Litomerice is in the north part of Czech Republic in the Usti nad
Labem Region and is approximately 72 km (45 miles) northwest of
Prague.
Its location can be found on a map of the country at:
