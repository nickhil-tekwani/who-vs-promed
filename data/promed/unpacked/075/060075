MENINGITIS - NIGERIA (6)
========================

Meningitis in northern Nigeria
I am an advisory member of a committee of expatriate Nigerians and
friends of Nigeria, who have recently organized a fund drive to help
fight the current meningitis epidemic in the northern part of the
country.
While CSM is acknowledged to be a perennial dry-season problem in
this region, many see in the scale of this year's affliction a
reflection of the military government's absolute dysfunction.
The Nigeria Meningitis Appeal Fund began just over two weeks ago on
one of the main Nigeria newsgroups on the Internet, under the
committed inspiration of O. Kasirim Nguwe of Boston University. Since
its inception, the appeal has raised nearly $2000.00 from dozens of
netters in the US and UK.
It is my understanding that Medecins Sans Frontiers has been the main
health NGO on the ground in and around Kano over the past several weeks.
I would like get confirmation about this and additional information as
to what other NGOs (Nigerian and non-Nigerian) are involved. We would
like to contact such organizations to determine immediate medical needs
of the vaccination campaign.
Thanks,
