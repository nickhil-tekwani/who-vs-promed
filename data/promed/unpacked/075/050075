The recent report of autochthonous malaria in Virginia (MMWR, 18 Oct 2002,
51:41, 921-923), mentioned as an aside that the 2 cases lived approximately
10 miles from Dulles airport. This distance and the finding of several
infected _Anopheles_ sp. collected in the vicinity of the cases diminished
the possibility that these were cases of "airport malaria".
We would like to query our North American and European colleagues as to
whether previous investigations of airport malaria included epidemiological
and entomological surveys that ruled out resident immigrants from
[malaria-endemic] regions and local _Anopheles_ sp.as the source of these
cases. Does the term "airport malaria" have a case definition that
precludes this alternative possibility?

[Airport malaria refers to the situation in which a malaria-infected
mosquito is transported by plane to a non-endemic area, where it escapes
the aircraft and infects people at the new location. The main point of the
definition is the absence of local transmission. If the index cases gives
rise to secondary cases, it is not airport malaria but autochthonous
malaria. To my knowledge, there has been no entomological investigation
published from the cases reported in London, Paris, and Amsterdam. Given
the climate, the parasite simply cannot develop in the local mosquitoes. In
the MMWR issue from 18 Oct 2002, the CDC did not confirm that the mosquito
pools were malaria-positive, and ProMED still regards this finding as
uncertain and pending confirmation from the CDC. The 2 boys could therefore
have been infected by mosquitoes carried from the airport either by the
wind, or more likely, by a vehicle. If the mosquito pools turn out to be
negative, this is perhaps the most likely explanation. - Mod.EP]
[Some background references on airport malaria for those interested: The
first reference by Gratz et al has an excellent discussion on the
transportation and survival of disease vectors (insects) related to
airplane travel. The article is available on line at
