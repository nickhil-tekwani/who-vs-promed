Heavy rains in recent weeks have caused disease outbreaks in livestock nationwide, a Veterinary Services Department official says. The department's director, Dr Josphat Nyika, told The Herald that anthrax was on the rise due to the incessant rains. [For example,] "when we dip the cattle, the chemicals are quickly washed away by the rains before they can have an effect on the animal," he said.

He said his department had received reports of anthrax outbreaks in Dande, Muzarabani and Mazowe [all in Mashonaland Central province], and teams were dispatched to control the situation. Dr Nyika urged farmers to vaccinate their cattle against the disease.

Anthrax has claimed 32 cattle in 37 reported cases.

[Anthrax is enzootic in Mashonaland Central province. Taking just the past 6 years, there were 2 bovine outbreaks (2 cases) reported in 2007; 21 (120 cases) in 2008; 4 (4 cases) in 2010; 2 (8 cases) in 2011; and 3 (50 cases) in 2012. All in all, the veterinary services in Zimbabwe are stretched. And we can presume that not all anthrax outbreaks get reported to the authorities.
