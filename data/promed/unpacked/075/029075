HEPATITIS C, SINGLE SOURCE OUTBREAK, 1998 - SPAIN

The Spanish newspaper El Pais recently published leaked findings from an
official investigation of surgical patients in two hospitals in Valencia,
Spain, who had acquired hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, according to the
Lancet (1). The patients are believed to have acquired the infection from
an anaesthetist, a morphine addict for many years, who is alleged to have
injected himself with opiate analgesics from syringes prepared for patients
immediately after their operations before giving them the remainder from
the same syringe (2,3). Apparently, there is no more than one nucleotide
difference in the non-hypervariable regions of virus from the anaesthetist
and from 170 out of 172 patients (1).

[And has he now lost his license to practice medicine? This message is
interesting insofar as it reports a very large single source outbreak of
hepatitis C virus. It is an extremely unusual outbreak because of the
antisocial elements; the act itself verging on biowarfare. - Mod. CHC]
