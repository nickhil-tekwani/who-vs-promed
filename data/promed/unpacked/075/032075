Cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis have been confirmed in Tata. The treatment of all cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis recently recorded in the province of Tata have been paid for, free of charge, by the health services under the Ministry of Health, said the regional department of this department at Massa.

"Following the information relayed about the appearance of cases of leishmaniasis in the commune of Kasbat Sidi Abdellah Ben M'bark, in the province of Tata, the Directorate undertook on [19 and 21 Oct 2018] in-depth research thanks to a team of senior staff from the regional directorate of the Ministry of Health at the provincial level; samples were taken from patients suspected of having cutaneous leishmaniasis, and the necessary laboratory tests confirmed that a certain number of students were suffering from this disease," said the same source in a statement.

All the registered cases were taken care of, says the same source, at the health center level 1 of the commune of Akka, and the rural health center level 1 of the commune Kasbat Sidi Abdellah Ben M'bark, under the responsibility of province of Tata.

The same source confirmed that "the urban health center and the rural health center have all the medicines needed to treat such cases." The provincial health services of Tata remain mobilized, along with other stakeholders, to overcome the causes and effects of this disease, the statement added.

[The _Leishmania_ situation in Morocco according to the WHO (http://www.emro.who.int/neglected-tropical-diseases/countries/cl-morocco.html):

This environmental complexity is reflected in the diversity of leishmaniasis. _Leishmania infantum_, _Leishmania major_ and _Leishmania tropica_ all occur, each in a specific range of vegetation types (bioclimatic stages).

Zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis due to _L. major_ occurs in unpredictable outbreaks in the south and south-east; _Phlebotomus papatasi_ is the vector, and the reservoir host has been identified as _Meriones shawi_. The transmission of _L. major_ from rodents to humans occurs at the end of the sandfly season (September and October). After a short incubation period of one week to 2 months, the lesions start to be seen in humans in late autumn and usually heal in less than 6 months. Sporadic zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis cases due to variants of _L. infantum_ occur in the north of the country.

Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis due to _L. tropica_ occurs in towns and villages in the centre of the country. The epidemiology of cutaneous leishmaniasis due to _L. tropica_ in Morocco is much more complex and less well understood than that of either visceral leishmaniasis or zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. The disease occurs at hypo-endemic intensity in separate foci between Tadla and Agadir, in the "subhumid" climate zone north and west of the High Atlas. Studies have shown discrepancy between the parasites in humans and vectors, this being an anomaly that requires further investigation, and strongly indicates the possibility of an unknown reservoir host.

Recent studies have found new focus on anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, and the emergence of cutaneous leishmaniasis is a current public health problem in Morocco. - Mod.EP
