Patient from Congo in Hospital in Canada with Suspected Hemorrhagic Fever
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Doctors in Hamilton [Ontario, Canada state that a woman who has just
arrived from the [Democratic Republic of Congo could be [harbouring the
deadly Ebola virus. The woman [was admitted to Henderson General Hospital
on Sunday [4 Feb 2001 in serious condition, with a [disease that has left
her drifting in and out of consciousness. Doctors stated that she could be
suffering also from a variety of [other illnesses including meningitis.
The woman is in isolation while a Health Canada laboratory in Winnipeg
tests for Ebola virus and other viruses associated with hemorrhagic fevers.
Doctors say that she arrived at Toronto's Pearson Airport on Saturday 3 Feb
2001 from the Congo.
Provincial medical officer of health Dr Colin D'Cunha stated that, based on
the area of Africa the woman travelled from, she could be suffering from
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, one of the viral hemorrhagic fevers
[endemic in that region.
