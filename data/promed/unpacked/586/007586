Bird flu detected in another Savar farm
--------------------------------------------
The avian influenza virus was detected yesterday [Sat 7 Apr 2007] at
another poultry farm in Savar. Chickens were being culled at the farm
last night.
Laboratory tests confirmed infection of the virus at Laura Poultry
Farm at Aukpara in Savar yesterday [Sat 7 Apr 2007] evening. A total
of 2000 chickens were culled as of 10:00 pm yesterday.
All the chickens at the infected farm will be culled, Livestock
Department Director Abdul Motaleb told reporters last night [Sat 7
Apr 2007]. The army and police cordoned off the infected farm.
Suspicion arose that the farm was infected with avian influenza --
bird flu -- after a considerable number of chickens died there on
Friday [6 Apr 2007], sources in the Savar Upazila [subdistrict]
Livestock Office said.
Upon receiving information, livestock officers from both the capital
and Savar rushed to the farm yesterday [Sat 7 Apr 2007] morning and
sent samples of chickens to the laboratory in Dhaka for testing.
Four teams of the Savar Livestock Office have been conducting drives
in the area to investigate whether there is any fresh infection of
the avian flu virus at any farm or place in the upazila.
Meanwhile, our Narayanganj correspondent reports that Fisheries and
Livestock Adviser Dr Chowdhury Sajedul Karim visited 2 bird
flu-infected poultry farms in the district yesterday [Sat 7 Apr 2007]
and urged all to remain alert about virus infection.
"Although infection and spreading of the virus has been prevented
temporarily, everyone should always remain alert to keep the poultry
farm industry alive," said Sajedul Karim at a meeting with poultry
farm owners, local journalists and government officials.
"The [fisheries and livestock] ministry will sort out a working plan
by next week to determine how to help or compensate the affected
poultry farm owners," he added.
Earlier, Sajedul visited Mukta Poultry Farm in Narayanganj sadar
upazila and Chistia Poultry Farm at Shiarchar in Fatulla. The adviser
gave assurances to provide modernized instrument, increase trained
manpower and other laboratory facilities for testing bird flu
infection. He also directed the deputy commissioner (DC) to take
necessary measures to provide the tuition fees and other necessary
academic facilities for the children of the affected poultry farm owners.
Livestock Secretary Syed Ataur Rahman, Joint Secretary Khalilur
Rahman Siddique, Deputy Secretary Anisur Rahman, Deputy Commissioner
Ahsan Habib and Superintendent of Police Sibgatullah were present at
the meeting, among others.
There are 989 poultry farms in Narayanganj. A total of 2476 chickens
have so far died since the detection of the virus, while 12 004
chickens were culled at the bird flu-infected farms in the district.

[Bangladesh reported 3 outbreaks of H5N1 on 30 Mar 2007; see
commentaries in 20070331.1106 and the original notification at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5154>.
The disease seems to be spreading.
The information about "providing tuition fees and other necessary
academic facilities for the children of the affected poultry farm
owners" deserves explanation. Is this the outcome of quarantine
measures imposed upon the infected farms, preventing
children/students from leaving the farms?!
An update of the AI situation might be anticipated. - Mod.AS]
