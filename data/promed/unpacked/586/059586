The Australian study is important and it confirms European studies in which this strain has been linked to pertussis outbreaks. The strain is not "new," however, and was 1st identified in 2004 in the Netherlands (1). On the basis of a mutation in the pertussis toxin promoter region, we designated this strain the P3 strain (or lineage) and showed that it produced higher levels of pertussis toxin compared to the strains it replaced (2).

The emergence of P3 strains was found to be associated with increases in pertussis notifications in Finland and the Netherlands (2). We also found that the P3 strains have a global distribution and very likely evolved recently (3 and unpublished data). The association of P3 strains with pertussis outbreaks in various parts of the world underlines the importance of high vaccine coverage, especially with respect to infants and it also indicates that we need better pertussis vaccines (4, 5).

[ProMED thanks Dr. Mooi for his comments and wishes to recognize the seminal work from his group regarding this field. It is becoming more apparent that alterations in the pertussis vaccine and/or vaccination schedule may be necessary. - Mod.LL]
