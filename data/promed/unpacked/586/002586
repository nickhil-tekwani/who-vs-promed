If by symptoms you mean secondary syphilis, false positives serologies
would be peculiar. Do you have sera stored and has someone set up for
storing follow-up specimens?
Several aspects of your report are concerning, including a reported
syphilis outbreak among the relatively well-off as well as the disconnect
between clinical and serologic findings.

I was curious about the "unusual outbreak of syphilis" described
in a PROMED inquiry. It is not unusual to see false negative
results in incubating primary syphilis with nontreponemal tests
(also treponemal tests). Generally, a positive darkfield supports
a diagnosis in primary stage regardless of serology. [Reference: A
Manual of Tests for Syphilis, ed. SLarsen,EHunter, SKraus; APHA,
1990]

Is there a particular test system that is being used and have the
false negatives been verified by another serological method? Have
subsequent samples been tested for reactivity? Were darkfields
negative?
