More background information from the WHO on the outbreak of cutaneous
leishmaniasis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Afghanistan and
nongovernmental organizations including Health Net International (HNI) and
TODAI [sorry, no expansion available. - Mod.SH], the World Health
Organization has recently evaluated the situation regarding cutaneous
leishmaniasis (CL) in Kabul. The situation in Kabul appears to be
particularly severe, with an estimated 200 000 cases of CL. Although CL is
not a lethal disease, it carries a high burden of social stigma. Movements
of populations both within the country and across borders due to the
consequences of ongoing conflicts are expected to increase the incidence of
the disease within the coming months.
CL has been endemic in Afghanistan for several years, with foci of zoonotic
(animal reservoir to man) transmission mainly in the northern provinces and
with human to human transmission typically in the large cities. An
emergency plan of action is being developed by WHO and other partners to
control the situation by the end of 2003, at least in Kabul. Priority
interventions include provision of impregnated bednets, early treatment of
cases with first-line drugs, recruitment and training of intervention
teams, and health education. WHO has already provided drugs for the
treatment of 35 000 cases. In collaboration with HNI, WHO has also provided
impregnated bednets for protection against the sandfly vector.
