A unit of the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition in Sri Lanka
recently reported laboratory-confirmed cases of chikungunya fever in
patients from several districts; the most affected districts are
Batticaloa, Colombo, Jaffna, Kalmunai, Mannar, Puttalam, and
Trincomalee. Surveillance activities for chikungunya fever cases are
continuing in sentinel hospitals in Sri Lanka.
In October 2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported ongoing
chikungunya fever outbreaks in the following states in India: Andhra
Pradesh, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka,
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Kerala.
A chikungunya fever outbreak on the Indian Ocean islands of Mayotte,
Mauritius, Reunion (territory of France), and the Seychelles that
began in March 2005 is waning. However, transmission can still occur,
and travelers to all tropical and subtropical areas of the world are
reminded to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.
Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the
bite of infected _Aedes_ and _Culex_ mosquitoes, including the
daytime-biting _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ species. Symptoms
can include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, nausea,
vomiting, joint pain with or without swelling, low back pain, and
rash. The symptoms are very similar to those of dengue, but, unlike
dengue, there is no hemorrhagic or shock syndrome form. This disease
is almost always self-limited and rarely fatal.

[If chikungunya virus transmission continues until the monsoon rains
return, one wonders if there will be an increase in cases then across
South Asia and the Indian Ocean Islands. ProMED-mail requests
information about efforts being made to control the _Aedes_ virus
vectors across this broad area.
