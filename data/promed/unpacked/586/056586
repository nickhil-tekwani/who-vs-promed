Lebanon: avian influenza detected in south Lebanon
--------------------------------------------------
30/03/06 -- The laboratory of the American University of Beirut has
detected the virus H7 on several samples of domestic poultry from the South
of Lebanon.
The Ministry of Agriculture has agreed for sending samples from the
affected poultry to the Weybridge Laboratory in UK or IZS-Venezie
laboratory in Italy for further testing.

[If confirmed, this becomes a significant finding and a cause for concern.
All HPAI strains isolated to date have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype,
therefore classified by the OIE as notifiable avian influenza (NAI). The
major outbreak in the Netherlands, 2003, was caused by H7N7. Since H5 and
H7 strains might be also of low virulence, it is essential that, as well as
their identification, their pathogenicity is determined as early as possible.
Confirmation of the above data or otherwise is anticipated; any available
information on the issue would be greatly appreciated.- Mod.AS]
