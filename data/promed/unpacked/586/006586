Rust-like spores found in LSU spore trap near St Joseph, LA
-----------------------------------------------------------
Spores similar to those associated with Asian soybean rust [ASR] have been
found in a trap set up by the Louisiana State University AgCenter in a
soybean field near St Joseph, LA, which is in the north east part of the
state near the Mississippi River.
According to David J Boethel, vice-chancellor for research at the LSU
AgCenter, there is no cause for alarm. The small number of spores precludes
confirmation at this time. But they appear similar to those that cause ASR,
and scouting efforts should be increased.
Word about the resemblance of the spores to the kind that cause ASR came
late on Tuesday (21 Jun) from a laboratory at the University of Arkansas.
As of 7:45 pm CDT, no notice of the find has been posted on
<http://www.sbrusa.net> either as a state commentary or in the national
Soybean Rust Forecast.
Ray Schneider, the LSU AgCenter plant pathologist, who discovered ASR for
the 1st time in North America in a soybean field near Baton Rouge, said the
Arkansas lab was recently established to run tests of spores from spore
traps sent in from soybean-producing states. Funding for the trapping
system is being provided by Syngenta, Schneider said. The traps, on stakes
in selected soybean fields across the state, include a slide (for a
microscope) covered with a sticky substance, Schneider said. These slides
are sent to the Arkansas lab once or twice a week.
Only 3 suspicious spores were on the slide that was sent to the lab by Boyd
Padgett, plant pathologist at the LSU AgCenter's Northeast Research
Station. The trap was in a soybean field at the station. No infected
soybean plants were found in an adjacent soybean field free of ASR
symptoms, Padgett said. About 100 spores are required to do the DNA tests
for confirmation of ASR.
Finding the spores does not mean soybean plants will necessarily get
infected. "That all depends on conditions," Schneider said. He said that
moisture is required for an infection to start. If we get regular rain and
heavy dews, then the occurrence of ASR is more likely. If the spores are
the ones that cause ASR and if conditions are right, it will be about 2
weeks following the spore shower before symptoms of the disease show up."
Because of the early warning that ASR rust had entered the country on the
winds of Hurricane Ivan in late 2004, soybean growers, industry people and
university experts have been able to prepare to manage the disease, should
it develop. The disease, first discovered in Asia in the early 1900s, has
steadily been spreading. It also is in Africa and South America, where it
has caused devastating yield losses because it spreads quickly, if undetected.
According to Clayton Hollier, LSU AgCenter monitors sentinel plots, which
were planted earlier in 2005, and select soybean production fields. "We are
alerting growers to continue and increase their scouting efforts," Hollier
said. "Growers certainly need to be prepared to spray for ASR."
Besides Louisiana and Arkansas, the other states involved in scouting for
ASR are Illinois, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee. "This is a very
important find," said Glen Hartman, research plant pathologist with the
USDA Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and associate professor at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He's one of the nation's
leading experts on ASR, Schneider said. "What it means is that we're
forewarned that the disease may be getting a start this growing season,"
Hartman said. "Scouting must be intensified. If we can get to the R6 growth
stage without finding the disease, then we are out of the danger period,"
Asian soybean rust can destroy soybeans through the R6 growth stage, which
is when the pods are forming. ASR can't hurt yields in the last 2 stages
(R7 and R8), when the beans yellow and the plant is harvested.

[This is the 1st report of potentially positive spores being found in the
spore traps located in AR, IL, KY, LA, MS, and TN. All spore samples from
the traps are being tested in a laboratory established at the University of
Arkansas; all others tested have been negative to date. Continued scouting
of soybean fields and sentinel plots may provide more information on the
status of ASR in the next week or so. The fact that only 3 ASR-like spores
could be found on 1 slide illustrates the difficulty that rust scouts are
facing. - Mod.DH]
