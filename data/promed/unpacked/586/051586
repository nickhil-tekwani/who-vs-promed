Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] occurred in the central province of
Quang Tri on [24 Sep 2008]. The samples taken from 15 infected cattle
at 3 animal breeding households in Duy Tan hamlet, Lao Bao town,
Huong Hoa district have been tested positive to the virus causing
foot-and-mouth disease.

The Quang Tri Veterinary service has isolated the said number of
cattle for treatments.

So far, only Quang Tri province is yet to be free from the disease
after 21 days.

[According to the PRO/MBDS* posting Foot & mouth disease - Viet Nam
(08): RFI archive no. 20080920.2961 of 20 Sep 2008 "there was an
outbreak in Ha Tinh province felt to be related to importation of
infected cattle from Nghe An province. It appears as though current
activity of FMD is isolated to Quang Tri province at this time."

According to the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) Southeast
Asia website on FMD (see
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/news.php?articleID=74>):
"During the year [2008], Southeast Asia has seen a reduction in the
number of FMD outbreaks as well as in serotypes and topotypes
circulating in the region compared to 2007. Based on reports from
Member Countries during the 11th SEAFMD (Southeast Asia Foot and
Mouth Disease Campaign) National Coordinators meeting, the serotypes
identified to have caused most of the outbreaks were the SE Asia
topotype of serotype O with some pockets of serotype A. Serotype Asia
1 and Cathay and Pan-Asia topotypes of O were observed to have caused
the outbreaks in previous years and were not reported this year.

"The following is a summary of the important events and trends in the
epidemiology of the disease in each of the member countries in the
region during this year [2008]:

"Only outbreaks of serotype O were noted in Viet Nam, and the total
number of outbreaks and circulating serotypes were continuously on
the decline as compared with 2007. In Lao PDR, outbreaks of serotype
O were only limited in 2 provinces (Vientiane and Xayaburi), while
Myanmar had some sporadic cases of serotype O following the
devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis.

"Cambodia has seen a relative increase in the number and geographical
distribution of outbreaks this year [2008], clustering in the
provinces near Phnom Penh and in the southern part of the country.

"Thailand experienced cases of both serotypes O and A, with a noted
increase and clustering of outbreaks in the southern regions of the
country. Thailand is in the process of establishing an FMD-free zone
in the eastern part of the country (Region 2). Peninsular Malaysia
continues to incur outbreaks, but with significant reduction in
Kelantan, and some alteration in the spatial distribution of serotype
O and A outbreaks was noted. The island states of Sabah and Sarawak,
however, remain FMD-free.

"In the Philippines, the island of Luzon has locally been declared
FMD-free, with no outbreaks occurring since December 2005. The rest
of the country is maintained as FMD free without vaccination.

"Finally, Indonesia remains FMD-free, and Brunei Darussalam has just
obtained recognition from OIE as an FMD-free Country without
vaccination in May 2008.

"This reduced incidence and improving disease situation has been
mainly attributed to the more intensified efforts of Member Countries
in the control and eradication of FMD. Moreover, knowledge of the
changing pattern in epizootics of the virus can significantly guide
current and future control measures, particularly those of
vaccination, thereby reinforcing overall regional and national strategies."

This map provides links to other recent outbreaks in Viet Nam and
neighboring countries that have been posted on ProMED-mail. - Mod.MPP

FMD was declared by Viet Nam as endemic on 23 Feb 2008. For a map
with outbreak locations during 2007 see
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5748>.

According to Viet Nam's official information to the OIE, 15 outbreaks
of FMD, serotype Asia 1, were recorded in Quang Tri during 2007. A
confirmation (or otherwise) of the current suspected outbreak in
Quang Tri, and -- if affirmative -- the identity of the serotype
involved, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
