[According to the latest Saudi MOH figures, with the addition of this newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection and death, the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia since June 2012 is now 772 including 329 deaths (case fatality rate 42.6 per cent). Today's newly reported case is an enigma vis a vis risk factor for exposure to the MERS-CoV -- the individual is not a healthcare worker, does not have a history of co-morbidities, nor does he have a history of animal exposure. If these risk exposures are truly negative, and this individual did not accompany a friend or family member to the health facilities indicated in nosocomial transmission, then one has to presume this individual had exposure in the community to another MERS-CoV infected individual without knowledge.

As for the announced death today, I have been unable to find a report mentioning the initial laboratory confirmation of this case. Perhaps this individual was one of the retrospectively confirmed cases mentioned on 19 Sep 2014 (see MERS-CoV (17): Saudi Arabia, new case, retrospective revision of case count 20140919.2788385). More information on the details surrounding this fatal case would be greatly appreciated, as well as more information on the newly laboratory-confirmed case as for possible other risk exposures not covered on the MOH announcement.

A suspected coronavirus patient forced a lockdown at an Istanbul hospital's emergency room for several hours on Tuesday [21 Oct 2014], health officials said. The emergency service of the Eyup public hospital was quarantined after a 73 year old woman coming back from Saudi Arabia exhibited coronavirus symptoms. The woman came to the emergency department of the hospital with complaints of high fever and nausea. The woman was eventually isolated in a special ward at the hospital, and the service was reopened. The patient had just returned from hajj. Close contact is believed to be the way the disease is communicated. Releasing a statement on the issue, the Istanbul Governorate said the patient's condition was improving but she would be monitored further in the hope of a full recovery.

Another female pilgrim was hospitalized in Istanbul after exhibiting potential coronavirus symptoms and initial diagnosis showed that she had the virus although health authorities have not verified yet whether she suffered from the virus.

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), commonly known as coronavirus, was 1st reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. It has been found in camels in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Egypt. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the lethal virus has claimed at least 317 deaths.

Because the disease posed a particular risk during hajj, Saudi Arabia said it had taken precautionary measures to prevent an outbreak.

A Turkish worker who returned from Saudi Arabia became the 1st Turkish casualty of the virus as authorities announced last week that the man died on [11 Oct 2014] at a hospital in the southern Turkish province of Hatay where he was being treated.

Also on Tuesday [21 Oct 2014], a 3rd suspected patient was identified in Adana, a city in the south of Turkey, again a Turkish traveler from Saudi Arabia. The 60 year old patient is currently being treated at a hospital which was briefly quarantined. It was reported that a female patient was also being monitored as a possible coronavirus case in the southern city of Antalya following her return from the Hajj.

Already on high alert after the Ebola virus outbreak in some African countries, Turkish authorities have recently stepped up measures against coronavirus. The Health Ministry ordered the screening of some 59 000 pilgrims who traveled to Saudi Arabia this year as well as those who traveled for umrah or lesser pilgrimage that can be performed at any time of the year unlike the hajj. Neighborhood clinics will monitor returning pilgrims for 14 days against symptoms of coronavirus.

[It is clear that the Turkish MOH and medical sector are taking the threat of importation of MERS-CoV infected individuals seriously following the confirmation of MERS-CoV infection in a returning worker from Saudi Arabia, as evidenced by the increase in suspected cases now followed by the media, and the concerted effort to follow pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia for the 2 week period (incubation period) for signs of possible MERS-CoV infection.

The above media report suggests that one of the suspected cases was positive for MERS-CoV -- "initial diagnosis showed that she had the virus although health authorities have not verified yet whether she suffered from the virus." More information on this report would be greatly appreciated.

[3] Philippines -- suspected cases

http://www.mindanews.com/top-stories/2014/10/22/3-of-7-suspected-merscov-carriers-in-zambo-test-negative-of-disease/


3 of 7 people from this city [Zamboanga, Mindanao] who were suspected of having the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) tested negative of the disease, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday [22 Oct 2014].

Dr Nimfa Torrizo, DOH regional director, said the 7 individuals were among the arriving hajj pilgrims from Saudi Arabia, where the 1st MERS-CoV case was reported. However, Torrizo said 3 of the 7 suspected carriers tested negative based on the laboratory analysis conducted by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. She said they were still waiting for the results of the 4 remaining cases. The official said 2 of the 4 patients were confined in a hospital while the other 2 were being quarantined at home.

The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos earlier informed the DOH that at least 3000 pilgrims from this city and from the nearby provinces of Basilan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi are scheduled to arrive here.

Torrizo said those who showed symptoms of MERS-CoV like fever and cough are all residents of this city. She said they have strengthened monitoring to prevent the entry and spread of MERS-CoV since the region has "so many entry points" from Manila, where initial examination is being held for passengers coming from the Middle East. She said that aside from the Zamboanga International Airport the airports in Pagadian City and Dipolog City, and even in Ozamis City, serve as entry points for passengers bound for Region 9.

She advised pilgrims or anyone who had traveled to the Middle East to submit themselves for medical examination should they manifest symptoms of MERS-CoV.

[As in Turkey, it appears as though the Philippines has increased surveillance for possible MERS-CoV infection in pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia. We await further information on results of tests on the suspected cases under investigation.
