The Brazil Ministry of Health reports recording 79 587 cases of syphilis, 31 090 cases of syphilis in pregnant women, and 12 014 cases of congenital syphilis in the country through June 2022.

This is generally in line with 2021 when more than 167 000 new cases of syphilis were registered in Brazil, with a detection rate of 78.5 cases per 100 000; 74 000 cases in pregnant women, and 27 000 occurrences of congenital syphilis, with a rate of 9.9 in children under one year of age per 1000 live births; and 192 deaths from congenital syphilis, with a rate of 7.0 per 100 000 live births.

Syphilis presents in primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary stages. In the primary and secondary stages, the possibility of transmission is greater, via sexual intercourse with an infected person. The most serious cases of acquired syphilis are observed in the tertiary stage, because if there is no adequate treatment, serious complications can arise, such as skin, bone, cardiovascular, and neurological lesions, which can lead to death. At all stages, syphilis can be transmitted to a child during pregnancy or childbirth. ["The risk for fetal infection is greatest in the early stages of untreated maternal syphilis and declines slowly thereafter, but the mother can infect her fetus during at least the 1st 5 years of her infection."
(https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/congenital-syphilis). - Mod.ML]

Congenital syphilis can have serious consequences for the baby, such as deafness, blindness, bone changes, and mental deficiency, which can lead to death. Therefore, every pregnant woman should be tested in the 1st prenatal consultation (ideally, in the 1st trimester of pregnancy); at the beginning of the 3rd trimester (28th week); at the time of delivery, or in case of abortion/stillbirth, regardless of previous examinations.

The rapid syphilis test is available at SUS [Unified Health System] health services, being practical and easy to perform, with reading the result in a maximum of 30 minutes, without the need for a laboratory structure. In 2022, until September, 9.5 million rapid tests were distributed to all states and the Federal District. The number exceeds the number of deliveries made in the whole of 2021, which was 9.03 million. "The testing rate has increased, which makes it possible to expand the diagnosis of the disease, especially among pregnant women, and also to offer treatment in a timely manner", observes Angelica Espinosa Miranda, the general coordinator of the Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections at the Ministry of Health.

According to the ministry, to prevent syphilis, it is essential to use male or female condoms. It is the only way to avoid the disease. In 2022 alone, Brazil distributed 293.9 million male and 4.5 million female condoms to the 26 states and the Federal District.

Syphilis is treated with antibiotics, which can be found in Basic Health Units. In the case of pregnant women, due to the risk of transmission to the fetus, treatment should be started only with a positive test, without having to wait for the result of the second test.

Syphilis infection can put both the adult and the baby at risk during pregnancy. Therefore, monitoring and testing of pregnant women and sexual partners during prenatal care is recommended in order to prevent congenital syphilis.

[According to the news report above, there were 27 000 cases of congenital syphilis in Brazil in 2021, with a rate of 9.9 cases per 1000 live births; rates of congenital syphilis had been increasing since at least 2010, reaching 8.76 cases of congenital syphilis per 1000 live births in 2017 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145144/).

In the USA, there were about 1/10 the number of cases of congenital syphilis (2677) in 2021 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2021/default.htm), up from 2148 cases in 2020 (with a rate of about 0.6 cases per 1000 live births) (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm#Syphilis). The increase in cases of congenital syphilis in Brazil and the USA mirrors an increase in syphilis among reproductive-aged women (https://www.cdc.gov/std/statistics/2020/overview.htm#Syphilis).

Control of congenital syphilis is achieved by antenatal screening and treatment of mothers who are infected. The recommended screening for syphilis consists of nontreponemal tests, either the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test (VDRL) or the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. If results are positive, these should be confirmed by a fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed (FTA-ABS) test or a _Treponema pallidum_ particle agglutination (MHA-TP) test (http://www.annals.org/content/150/10/705.full and http://www.annals.org/content/150/10/710.full). Screening should be performed at the 1st prenatal visit in all pregnant women, as well as in the 3rd trimester and at delivery for women at high risk. Groups at high risk include uninsured women, women living in poverty, sex workers, illicit drug users, women diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases, and those living in communities with high syphilis morbidity (http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf09/syphilis/syphpgsum.htm).

For the treatment of syphilis during pregnancy, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends parenteral benzathine penicillin G. Because evidence is limited regarding the efficacy or safety of alternative antibiotics in pregnancy, women who report penicillin allergies should be evaluated and desensitized to penicillin if necessary.

Poverty and other social factors have had a big impact on rates of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases among women the USA. A history of incarceration, homelessness, and illicit drug use among heterosexuals, perhaps involving the practice of trading sex with multiple partners for drugs, have been repeatedly cited in prior ProMED posts on the rising incidence of syphilis in the USA (and see https://www.cdc.gov/std/dstdp/DCL-SyphilisRiskMMWR-feb2019.pdf). However, social factors that could be possibly linked to the increasing cases of congenital syphilis in Brazil are not mentioned in the news report above.

More information on this outbreak of congenital syphilis in Brazil would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
