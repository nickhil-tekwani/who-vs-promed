In previous years, the number of rabies-infected animals in our region [Tula] has been relatively low, while currently it has increased. During the 1st 5 months of this year [2015], 64 cases have already been identified, which is more than twice as many as last year's [2015] figures. Rospotrebnadzor believes that [the increased incidence] may be caused by insufficient measures to combat rodents in populated areas [see comment].

Typically, cases are registered mostly among stray animals, while now about 80 percent of rabies cases are found in domestic animals. Pets that are not vaccinated often walk unleashed and get in contact with wildlife and thus are under high risk of catching an infection.

In Tula, officials launched a large scale vaccination of stray animals and are working to identify all spots where stray animals can be collected.

[The mentioned assumption of Rospotrebnadzor (Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Well-Being) that rodents are the reservoir of the rabies virus is in need of supportive evidence.

It will also be helpful to know what is meant by "stray animals;" stray dogs or, rather, wildlife? If the latter is the case, it would be helpful to know whether oral vaccination is applied. Oral vaccination of wildlife is the recommended mode for spatial rabies control, on top of continued general rabies vaccination of domestic pets (dogs and cats) in affected areas. - Mod.AS
