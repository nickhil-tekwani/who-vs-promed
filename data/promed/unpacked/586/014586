Abstract
--------
Globally, anthrax outbreaks pose a serious threat to people, livestock, and wildlife. Furthermore, environmental change can exacerbate these outbreak dynamics by altering the host-pathogen relationship. However, little is known about how the quantitative spatial dynamics of host movement and environmental change may affect the spread of _Bacillus anthracis_, the causative agent of anthrax. Here, we use real-time observations and high-resolution tracking data from a population of common hippopotamus (_Hippopotamus amphibius_) in Tanzania to explore the relationship between river hydrology, _H. amphibius_ movement, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of an active anthrax outbreak.

We found that extreme river drying, a consequence of anthropogenic disturbances to our study river, indirectly facilitated the spread of _B. anthracis_ by modulating _H. amphibius_ movements. Our findings reveal that anthrax spread upstream in the Great Ruaha River (~3.5 km [2.2 mi] over a 9-day period), which followed the movement patterns of infected _H. amphibius_, who moved upstream as the river dried in search of remaining aquatic refugia. These upstream movements can result in large aggregations of _H. amphibius_.

However, despite these aggregations, the density of _H. amphibius_ in river pools did not influence the number of _B. anthracis_-induced mortalities. Moreover, infection by _B. anthracis_ did not appear to influence _H. amphibius_ movement behaviors, which suggests that infected individuals can vector _B. anthracis_ over large distances right up until their death.

Finally, we show that contact rates between _H. amphibius_- and _B. anthracis_-infected river pools are highly variable and the frequency and duration of contacts could potentially increase the probability of mortality. While difficult to obtain, the quantitative insights that we gathered during a real-time anthrax outbreak are critical to better understand, predict, and manage future outbreaks.

Anthrax outbreaks in hippopotami rarely involve just a couple of animals. Rivers get clogged with carcasses. This can make it difficult to work out what happened and why. So this paper in Ecosphere is well worth reading, and having on hand when revisiting such an event. - Mod.MHJ
