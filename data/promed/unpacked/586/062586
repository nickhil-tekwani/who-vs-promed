DPT RECALL - BRAZIL (02)
========================

[see
DPT vaccine recall - Brazil 970104121459]
For the second time this year, Brazilian health authorities recalled a large
lot of DPT vaccine (approx. 5 million doses) due to a higher than acceptable
incidence of reactions. This lot had been imported recently from India. DPT
vaccination has suffered problems in Brazil since August 1996, when supplies
diminished due to bureaucratic problems in vaccine acquisition. Vaccine
imported from Switzerland had to be recalled early this year.
There is no reliable estimate of how much vaccine coverage suffered after more
than 6 months of inadequate supplies and impaired acceptance. Danger of an
epidemic, such as the one in Russia in the early '90s is real. In Russia, as
in Brazil, inadequate supplies and a high incidence of adverse reactions led
to a low coverage.
