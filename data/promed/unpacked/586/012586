The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) yesterday [5 Apr 2018] issued a health advisory about 6 confirmed measles cases, plus another from Nevada linked to the cluster. The Bay-area cases are from Santa Clara (5) and Alameda (1) counties and involve unvaccinated people.

All 7 cases are linked to an unvaccinated traveler who was exposed in Europe and began having symptoms after returning to the Bay area.

Local health departments are conducting contact investigations, and the SFDPH is urging clinicians to suspect measles in patients with a rash and fever, regardless of travel history. Also, the department advised clinicians to prepare their facility for the possibility of measles cases and to ask patients to call ahead if they have fever and rash.

The patient in Nevada appears to be a student at the University of Nevada, Reno, according to a 4 Apr 2018 statement from the Washoe County Health District (WCHD). It said the patient doesn't pose an ongoing risk to the public, but was at several locations in the area during the infectious period, and health officials are working to notify potential contacts. Many of the locations were at the university, but they also include Squaw Valley Ski Resort [Lake Tahoe, California], medical clinics, and retail locations.

There are now 5 confirmed cases of measles in Santa Clara County and another one in Alameda County health officials said.

All the cases involve patients who haven't been shot with the proper vaccines, according to George Han of the Santa Clara County Department of Public Health, who refused to give out personal information of the patients because of doctor-patient confidentiality protections.

He did say, however, that the public threat is very low, suggesting the outbreak will not further worsen. Still, he mentions that the 6 cases being closely linked is odd, especially since America has mostly gotten rid of the virus over the years.

"It's pretty uncommon because measles has been eliminated in this country for some time now due to our high vaccination rates," he said.

Santa Clara county
------------------
One of the patients got the disease while traveling in Europe, as The Mercury News reports. Health officials started identifying cases in March [2018]. The current tally is as of 4 Apr 2018.

They are also encouraging people to get vaccinated for the disease, noting that the practice is a routine childhood vaccination for school entry. MMR vaccine is the common type of vaccine against measles, and also mumps and rubella.

What is measles?
----------------
Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through coughing or sneezing. It can also linger for hours and infect people that come into contact with contaminated surfaces.

"[M]easles virus can live for up to 2 hours in an airspace where the infected person coughed or sneezed. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch the infected surface, then touch their eyes, noses, or mouths, they can become infected," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected." ...

The Washoe County Health District is confirming the 1st case of measles in the region since 1999. Reno Public Radio's Anh Gray has more.

Health Officials say that the infected person is a University of Nevada, Reno [Washoe county] student, and that he does not pose an ongoing risk. Randall Todd is an epidemiologist with the health district.

"He had been vaccinated against measles, and the vaccine is very effective," Todd explains. "It's about 97 percent [effective], but that still leaves a 3 percent opportunity for people who are exposed, and he did have an exposure in another state to a confirmed case there."

Todd says symptoms include fever, runny nose, cough, and sore throat. It's followed by a rash that spreads over the body. In a statement, the university says their policy is to not allow students who aren't immunized on campus due to the health risk. Students can return to campus if they receive immunizations or have been cleared by the health district.

Health officials are tracking down people who may have been in contact with the student and have released a list of the times and places he visited during an infectious period. Those areas include campus buildings, a ski hill in Lake Tahoe [California] and an urgent care center in Reno [see item [1] above].

[5] Venezuela (Delta Amacuro state): indigenous children, fatal
Date: Thu 5 Apr 2018
Source: Medical Xpress [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2018-04-children-dead-venezuela-measles-outbreak.html


At least 70 children from an indigenous tribe have died from an outbreak of measles in a remote jungle region of eastern Venezuela, a human rights group said [Thu 5 Apr 2018].

"The propagation started in early January [2018] and we are calling for a health alert," said Armando Obdola, head of the Kape Kape NGO.

Obdola said he had been recording the deaths in the state of Delta Amacuro, where children of the Warao indigenous community have been dying since the beginning of the year [2018]. "There are no medicines, and there's nothing the doctors and nurses can do."

Latin America was declared free of measles in 2016, but the Pan American Health Organization [PAHO] last month [March 2018] reported a virulent outbreak in Venezuela.

The country has the highest number of confirmed cases, 159, among 9 Latin American countries that reported cases in the 1st 3 months of 2018.

The 2nd biggest outbreak, in Brazil, has 14 confirmed cases, all of them imported from Venezuela. "All confirmed cases were reported in unvaccinated Venezuelan citizens between the ages of 9 months and 18 years," said PAHO.

Measles, a highly contagious viral disease that affects children in particular, is preventable with vaccination.

Venezuela's deepening economic crisis has caused chronic shortages of food and medicines. Access to affected areas is difficult. The Warao settlements are located on the edge of the Orinoco River, 8 hours' travel from the regional capital Tucupita. "Sometimes getting to a sick person is impossible. The boats do not have fuel, and despite the seriousness of the situation the silence of the authorities has prevailed," said Obdola.

Venezuela's Health Minister Luis López said [Tue 3 Apr 2018] on Twitter that the government of President Nicolás Maduro is fine-tuning details for the launch of a national vaccination plan for diphtheria, measles, and yellow fever.

[Brazil is struggling to accommodate the extremely large number of Venezuelans attempting to escape their homeland's collapsing economy and political unrest. The indigenous Warao are among their greatest challenges.

This group of people is traditionally poor and marginalized in Venezuela, and they have more health problems than other Venezuelans. Those health needs are exacerbated by cultural and linguistic differences that make adjustment to life in Brazil extremely difficult. That, together with their apparent distrust of non-indigenous peoples, makes vaccination campaigns for the indigenous people problematic. - Mod.LK

Over the past week in Romania has recorded 204 new cases of measles.

In Romania throughout the year, measles caused illness in almost 12 000 people, of whom 46 died. It is reported by The Associated Press Fri 6 Apr reports the online edition of the Chronicle.info with reference to the Correspondent.

In particular, over the past week 204 new cases of measles were recorded. A 9-month-old child died who was not vaccinated.

According to the European centre for prevention and fight against diseases, the number of measles cases last year [2017] on the continent has tripled, while Romania and Italy have suffered the most.

From the beginning of the year [2018] in Ukraine, 9091 cases of measles have been reported. Five adults and 2 children died from complications of the disease. Only last week, nearly 700 people became ill.

Birmingham is at the centre of a measles outbreak, with cases rocketing to record levels.

A European outbreak has spread to Britain, with Brum [Birmingham] seeing 42 cases so far in 2018 -- compared to just 7 at the same stage last year [2017].

In the 13 weeks up to April [2018], 696 suspected cases of measles were reported to Public Health England (PHE) across England and Wales -- but Birmingham has suffered the worst of it.

But how to do know if you or your child has measles?

This is the advice from the NHS about how to spot it:
What are the early symptoms?

Measles starts with cold-like symptoms that develop about 10 days after becoming infected. This is followed a few days later by the measles rash. For most people, the illness lasts around 7 to 10 days in total. The initial symptoms of measles can include: a runny or blocked nose, sneezing, watery eyes, swollen eyelids, sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light, a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40 deg C (104 deg F), small greyish-white spots in the mouth, aches and pains, a cough, loss of appetite, tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy. A day or 2 before the rash appears, many people with measles develop small greyish-white spots in their mouth. Not everyone with measles has these spots, but if someone has them in addition to the other symptoms listed above or a rash, it's highly likely they have the condition. The spots will usually last for a few days.

A measles rash appears around 2 to 4 days after initial symptoms. Raised spots may join together to form blotchy patches. You'll usually feel most ill on the 1st or 2nd day after the rash develops.
The rash:
- is made up of small red-brown, flat or slightly raised spots that may join together into larger blotchy patches;
- usually first appears on the head or neck, before spreading outwards to the rest of the body;
- is slightly itchy for some people;
- can look similar to other childhood conditions, such as slapped cheek syndrome, roseola, or rubella;
- is unlikely to be caused by measles if the person has been fully vaccinated (had 2 doses of the MMR [measles, mumps, rubella vaccine) or had measles before.

With 598 confirmed measles cases in the 1st quarter of 2018, the Department of Health (DOH) has set a 2-track immunization catch-up plan to contain the disease.

In an interview yesterday [2 Apr 2018], Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said they decided to conduct two levels of immunization activities to effectively curb the rise of measles in the country.

The rise in measles cases had been attributed to the lack of trust of many parents in the government's immunization program following the controversy over the Dengvaxia vaccine used by the DOH in its dengue immunization program among 837 000 school children in the National Capital Region (NCR), Region 3, Region 4-A, and Cebu.

"We really have to address this issue. We hope that parents will trust our vaccination program again to protect our children from vaccine-preventable diseases," he added.

He said the department had documented 598 confirmed measles cases from January to March this year [2018], including 12 deaths. Duque admitted this is very high compared to data that showed only 16 cases recorded from 1 Jan-17 Mar 2017. There was no reported death.

He noted the department will also be forming a task force that will oversee the implementation of the vaccination and education programs for measles.

Yesterday [2 Apr 2018], Duque with DOH experts on epidemiology and immunization said they decided to do two-track immunization activities to contain cases.

"We'll be having measles immunization catch-up plan on a national level while we are going to enhance our local immunization which is now ongoing as part of our ORI (Outbreak Response Immunization) strategies," he said.

The local immunization plan targets people in areas where there are outbreaks of measles.

"We will be doing a more targeted immunization in coordination with the local government units. We'll do house-to-house and a massive campaign so parents will bring their children for immunization," Duque maintained.

On the other hand, the national catch-up plan will be done this 2nd quarter all over the country.

Duque added the nationwide vaccination will be done at health centers while, at the same time, health workers will also be dispatched to do house-to-house immunization.

Records showed that the age of the patients ranged from 1-39 years old with those below 5 years accounting for 70 percent of cases.

60 percent of those eligible for the anti-measles vaccine and above 9 months old have no history of vaccination.

The areas that have outbreaks are Davao city (93), Zamboanga city (38), Cotabato city (30), Taguig city (27), and Marawi city (20). By region, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao had the most cases with 149, followed by Region 11 with 143, Region 12 with 76, Region 9 with, 65 and NCR [National Capital Region] with 53.

The top provinces with confirmed cases are Davao del Sur (96), Lanao del Sur (63), Maguindanao (55), Metro Manila (53), Zamboanga del Sur (44), Lanao del Norte (30), Basilan (29), Davao del Norte (27), and North Cotabato (19). The provinces of Misamis Oriental, Negros Oriental, and South Cotabato have 17 cases each.

In the last 4 days, 3 cases of measles have been confirmed in the South Island. This is a notifiable disease and the cases have been reported in Queenstown, Wanaka, and Christchurch.

At this time the common place of exposure for all 3 cases is Queenstown Airport, where all 3 are likely to have been in contact with an unknown infectious case on 21 or 22 Mar 2018. This person may have had a relatively mild illness and will now be fully recovered. Any other at-risk people exposed on 21-22 Mar 2018 are now at the end of their maximum incubation period and unlikely to get sick.

None of the 3 known cases were immunised to measles.

Southern and Canterbury DHBs [district health boards] are working together on this investigation and close contacts of all 3 cases have been identified and are being followed up.

Unimmunised people who have been exposed to any of the 3 cases are most likely to become ill between 10-20 Apr 2018. People are considered immune if they have received 2 doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine, have had a measles illness previously, or were born before 1969.

Canterbury DHB Medical Officer of Health Dr Ramon Pink says it's important people with symptoms don't visit GP rooms or after-hours clinics but phone their family doctor/general practice team first for advice, to limit further exposure to other people.

"People are infectious from 5 days before the onset of the rash to 5 days after the rash starts and should stay in isolation during this time. This means staying home from school or work and having no contact with unimmunised people," says Dr Pink.

If people call their GP Team after-hours a nurse will answer the call and advise what to do and where to go if you need to be seen. ...

A 5th case of measles has been confirmed in the Brisbane region, with the latest patient having spent time in the Valley nightclub district on the Easter weekend [31 Mar-1 Apr 2018].

Queensland Health (Metro South) released details on the 5th case on [Sun 8 Apr] following confirmation last week that 4 cases had been reported.

The last affected person's movements included visiting the Fortitude Valley entertainment precinct for 4 hours from 11 pm, Sat 31 Mar 2018.

Public Health physician Dr Bhakti Vasant said it was vital for residents, if they weren't already, to be vaccinated for measles. "Vaccinations are recommended for anyone born after 1965, who has not had 2 documented doses of measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine or had proven measles," Dr Vasant said. "Anyone who may have come into contact with an infectious person, and are uncertain of their immunity to measles should speak to their GP immediately."

Measles is one of the most infectious of all communicable diseases and is spread by tiny droplets through coughing and sneezing. It causes fever, lethargy, moist cough, runny nose, and then a red spotty rash and sore eyes a few days later. The rash often starts on the face and then becomes widespread.

Measles may lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation, and other serious illness.

While extensive contact tracing was being conducted, Dr Vasant said residents in the Brisbane and Logan areas also needed to be alert for symptoms.

Epidemiological update measles -- 6 Apr 2018
------------------------------------
Situation summary
-----------------
Since the last Epidemiological Update for measles issued by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) on 16 Mar 2018, 2 additional countries in the Region of the Americas have confirmed measles cases: Argentina (1 case) and Ecuador (1 case). This brings the total number of countries with confirmed measles cases since the beginning of 2018 until epidemiological week (EW) 14 [week ending 6 Apr 2018] to 11. This figure is higher than in 2017, when 4 countries reported confirmed measles cases in the region: Argentina (3 cases), Canada (45), the United States of America (120), and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (727 cases). Between EW 1 and EW 14 of 2018, confirmed measles cases in the Region were reported in Antigua and Barbuda (1 case), Argentina (1), Brazil (46), Canada (4), Colombia (5), Ecuador (1), the United States of America (41), Guatemala (1), Mexico (4), Peru (2), and Venezuela (279).

The report is a summary of the situation in the countries reporting measles cases in 2018. ...

----------------------------------------------------------------------
For many years, rates of measles (per 100 000 population) reported by the WHO European and Americas Regions have been similar. During the same period, both regions have maintained high uptake of measles vaccine.[1,2]

In the graph at https://www.gideononline.com/2018/04/06/measles-rates-vs-vaccine-coverage/, I have contrasted these figures with those of Africa, which continues to report both high measles rates and inadequate vaccine usage.
