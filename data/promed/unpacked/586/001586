A flu-like illness has killed several Tasmanians in the past three weeks.
Royal Hobart Hospital doctor Richard Wood-Baker yesterday confirmed "a
handful" of patients had died in the past three weeks after contracting the
illness which produced symptoms similar to influenza. But he said it was
not influenza but another viral upper-respiratory infection which was
believed to be circulating in southern Tasmania.
The patients who had died were high-risk patients who already had lung
disease before they contracted the infection. Dr Wood-Baker said many of
the hospital's staff had also been ill with the infection.
It was associated with coughing, a runny nose, sore throat, sneezing and in
some cases nausea and vomiting. Dr Wood-Baker said the virus seemed to have
passed its peak in terms of the numbers infected. While it closely
resembled influenza, Dr Wood-Baker said flu was more likely to cause
muscular aches and pains and high fever.
"There have been reports of an outbreak of influenza type A on mainland
Australia," he said.
People classed as high risk should be vaccinated against influenza, he
said. But they should also be aware that flu vaccination would not protect
them against other viral respiratory infections which often closely
resembled flu.
Those classed as high risk are adults aged 65 and over, adults with chronic
debilitating disease, anyone with suppressed immunity, residents of nursing
homes, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait adults aged 50 and over. In
Australia 4.2 million people are classed as high risk.
The number of people vaccinated yearly is about 2.3 million.
The estimated number of flu deaths yearly is 800 to 2700 although this
figure is thought to be under-reported.
The International Influenza Education Panel says the development of a new
class of antiviral treatment using neuraminidase inhibitors is a major
advance. These target the influenza virus directly by selectively
inhibiting the viral enzyme, neuraminidase. If treatment begins in the
first two days after symptoms appear, the drugs significantly cut the
duration and severity of illness.

[The claim that the Tasmanian epidemic is not influenza, but something that
"closely resemble[s] influenza", should probably at this point be taken
with a grain of salt, since major influenza A Sydney (H3N2) epidemics are
occurring elsewhere in Australia and in New Zealand and (possibly) Pohnpei.
Influenza symptoms and signs vary widely, especially in the very young and
the very old, so that it is possible to have many sequential cases without
seeing a "classical" clinical picture. Hospital
epidemics of influenza A are common, and nursing home epidemics even more
so. The latter may or may not include staff epidemics. Severe illnesses
and deaths are common even in vaccinated elderly institutionalized
patients. In addition to influenza A, influenza B and respiratory syncytial
virus may
both cause nursing home outbreaks featuring severe and fatal infections in
the elderly and debilitated. - Mod.DM]
