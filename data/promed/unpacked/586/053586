[Given the occurrence of this disease in the area (see ProMED-mail archive list below), it should not be surprising that lumpy skin disease (LSD) has now been reported in Kuwait.

Since January 2012 to date, LSD has been officially reported by Azerbaijan, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestinian Autonomous Territories, Turkey, and now Kuwait. During this period, a total of 625 outbreaks were reported. See WAHID's OIE database, section "Disease timeline series", at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries.

LSD is transmitted by biting insects such as mosquitoes, horse flies, deer flies, biting midges and tsetse flies. The disease is often found near river basins and other areas where these insects gather. The most likely way for LSD to enter a new area is by the introduction of infected cattle into a herd. Biting insects that have fed on infected cattle can also spread the disease and can travel substantial distances. The virus may persist for months in contaminated cattle hides, providing another source of the disease (http://tinyurl.com/o2bcqk7).

A map showing the distribution of outbreaks can be obtained at OIE's WAHID database, section "Disease outbreak maps", at http://tinyurl.com/kbvl6rz. (Note: to view the information on LSD, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, and choose a time period; example: From 1 Jan 2012 to 5 Jan 2015.
