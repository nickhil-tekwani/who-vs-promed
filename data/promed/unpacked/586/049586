The Food and Drug Administration is conducting a very active and
dynamic investigation into the source of the _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Typhimurium outbreak. At this time, the FDA has traced one
likely source of _S._ Typhimurium contamination to a plant owned by
Peanut Corporation of America (PCA), which manufactures both peanut
butter that is institutionally served in such settings as long-term
care facilities and cafeterias, and peanut paste, a concentrated
product consisting of ground, roasted peanuts that is distributed to
food manufacturers to be used as an ingredient in many products
including cakes, cookies, crackers, candies, cereal and ice cream.

The FDA has notified PCA that product samples originating from its
Blakely, Georgia processing plant have been tested and found positive
for _Salmonella_ by laboratories in the states of Minnesota, Georgia
and Connecticut. The state of Minnesota reported to FDA that its
samples of King Nut peanut butter are a genetic match to the strain
that has caused illnesses in the state and around the country. King
Nut is a distributor of PCA product.

As a result of these updated test results, on 16 Jan 2009, PCA
expanded its voluntary recall to include all peanut butter produced
on or after 8 Aug 2008 and all peanut paste produced on or after 26
Sep 2008 in its Blakely, Georgia plant because of potential
_Salmonella_ contamination. The product being recalled is sold by PCA
in bulk packaging in containers ranging in size from 5 to 1700
pounds. The peanut paste is sold in sizes ranging from 35 pound
containers to product sold by the tanker container. These products
are not sold directly to consumers. PCA has stopped all production at
its Blakely, Georgia plant as the FDA continues its investigation
into the source of the _Salmonella_ contamination.

Based on this information, and on the current state of the
investigation, the FDA recommends that consumers avoid eating
products that have been recalled and discard them.

Because identification of products subject to recall is continuing,
the FDA urges consumers to postpone eating commercially-prepared or
manufactured peanut butter-containing products and
institutionally-served peanut butter until further information
becomes available about which products may be affected. Efforts to
specifically identify those products are ongoing.

At this time, there is no indication that any national name brand
jars of peanut butter sold in retail stores are linked to the PCA
recall. As the investigation continues over the weekend, and into
next week, the FDA will be able to update the advice based on new
sampling and distribution information.

The FDA is working closely with members of the food industry to
narrow this advice and to publish a detailed list of implicated
products as soon as possible. The FDA is encouraging manufacturers to
help inform consumers about whether their products could have
contained commercially prepared peanut butter or peanut paste from
PCA. Also, if manufacturers know their products do not contain
ingredients from PCA, they may wish to inform consumers of that fact.
Retailers should stop selling products which have been recalled.

The FDA will closely monitor these events by continuing to work with
the firms on the details of their actions, conduct follow-up audits
and inspections, monitor the progress of the firms' actions, and
notify our foreign regulatory counterparts of products that may have
been distributed internationally.

[This expands the recall, especially related to peanut paste-related
products. There are now 3 states that appear to have "smoking" peanut
butter. The original isolate from Minnesota was from an open
container. It is not stated here but is stated below in the CDC
report that the other states' "smoking" peanut butter isolates were
from unopened jars. - Mod.LL]

As of 9:00 PM EDT Fri 16 Jan 2009, 474 persons infected with the
outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 43
states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as
follows: Alabama (1), Arizona (10), Arkansas (4), California (60),
Colorado (11), Connecticut (8), Georgia (6), Hawaii (3), Idaho (11),
Illinois (5), Indiana (4), Iowa (1), Kansas (2), Kentucky (3), Maine
(4), Maryland (8), Massachusetts (40), Michigan (25), Minnesota (35),
Missouri (9), Mississippi (1), Nebraska (1), New Hampshire (11), New
Jersey (19), New York (19), Nevada (5), North Carolina (4), North
Dakota (10), Ohio (64), Oklahoma (2), Oregon (5), Pennsylvania (14),
Rhode Island (4), South Dakota (2), Tennessee (9), Texas (6), Utah
(4), Vermont (4), Virginia (20), Washington (13), West Virginia (2),
Wisconsin (3), and Wyoming (2).

Among the 458 persons with dates available, illnesses began between 8
Sep 2008 and 2 Jan 2009. Patients range in age from less than one to
98 years; 47 percent are female. Among persons with available
information, 23 percent reported being hospitalized. Infection may
have contributed to 6 deaths.

The Connecticut Department of Public Health Laboratory and the
Georgia Department of Agriculture independently isolated _Salmonella_
from unopened 5-pound containers of King Nut brand peanut butter.
Further tests are pending to determine whether this _Salmonella_ is
the outbreak strain.

Clusters of infections in several states have been reported in
schools and other institutions, such as long-term care facilities and
hospitals. King Nut is the only brand of peanut butter used in those
facilities for which we have information.

King Nut is produced by Peanut Corporation of America in Blakely,
Georgia. This facility is now recalling 2 products it makes: (1)
peanut butter (made on or after 8 Aug 2008) and (2) peanut paste
(made on or after 26 Sep 2008) at the Georgia facility. In many
instances, the peanut butter and peanut paste is further distributed
to manufacturers to be used as ingredients in many products,
including cookies, crackers, cereal, candy, ice cream and other foods.

The list of products that may be affected is still being determined
and is incomplete at this time. However, a list of products known to
be implicated at this point in the investigation can be found on the
FDA website. FDA and the product manufacturers are working to
determine the list of affected products, which may be extensive. Some
companies have already announced whether their products include
ingredients being recalled by Peanut Corporation of America, Georgia,
and more companies are expected to make similar announcements.

CDC with state partners is continuing to identify and interview ill
persons. To clarify the types of peanut-butter-containing foods that
are associated with the outbreak, CDC is currently conducting a 2nd
national case-control study. State partners are also collecting and
testing various peanut-butter containing foods.

Based on available information, CDC and FDA recommendations include:

For consumers
-------------
Do not eat products that have been recalled, and throw them away in a
manner that prevents others from eating them. Postpone eating other
peanut butter containing products (such as cookies, crackers, cereal,
candy and ice cream) until information becomes available about
whether that product may be affected. Persons who think they may have
become ill from eating peanut butter are advised to consult their
health care providers.

For retailers
-------------
Stop selling recalled products.

For directors of institutions and food service establishments
-------------
Ensure that they are not serving recalled products.

For manufacturers
-------------
Inform consumers about whether their products could contain peanut
butter or peanut paste from Peanut Corporation of America (PCA). If a
manufacturer knows their products do not contain peanut paste from
PCA, they should inform consumers of that. To date, no association
has been found with major national brand name jars of peanut butter
sold in grocery stores.
