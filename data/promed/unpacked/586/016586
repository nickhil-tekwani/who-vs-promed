_Trypanosoma evansi_ is a flagellated protozoan that parasitizes a wide variety of mammals, occasionally including humans. In South America, it infects horses, cattle, buffaloes, dogs, and wild mammals, causing a disease known as "mal de caderas" [or surra], which results in important economic losses due to a wide range of pathological expressions. Argentina represents the southern limit of its distribution.

The capybara (_Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris_) is a large rodent found in tropical to temperate freshwater wetlands of South America. As capybaras infected with _T. evansi_ present no clinical signs of disease, withstanding high parasitaemia, this species was proposed as a reservoir host.

In this study we investigated the prevalence and parasitaemic intensity of _T. evansi_ in samples obtained from 60 free-ranging capybaras of Esteros del Ibera (Corrientes province, northeastern Argentina) using smear microscopy and real-time PCR assays. All the cases of capybaras infected with _T. evansi_ were found during one of the 3 years studied (2011), with no evidence of seasonality. The overall infection prevalence was 10 percent, but between years it ranged from 0 percent to 17 percent. This is the 1st confirmation of _T. evansi_ infection in Argentina by molecular biology techniques. Our results showed no differences between the methods used to detect the presence of _T. evansi_ in capybaras, which indicates that simple methods like microscopy can generate important data on the ecoepidemiology of this parasite. Both techniques used in this study represent a viable tool for ecoepidemiological studies, and can be used to produce good estimates of prevalence and parasitaemic level of the infection, which inform for the implementation of strategies for the control of the disease.

[_Trypanosoma evansi_ originates from Africa, and it was probably introduced in South America during the 16th century by Spanish settlers. The wildlife species that have been reported infected at high prevalences in South America are capybaras, coatimundis (_Nasua nasua_), peccaries (Fam. Tayassuidae), and small rodents like _Thrichomys_ spp, _Clyomys_ spp, and _Oecomys_ spp. The significance of _T. evansi_ infection in these native species is unknown, requiring further research to establish their role in the epidemiology of "mal de caderas" and the impact on their populations.

_T. evansi_ is mainly transmitted by insects, but unlike other African trypanosomes, it does not multiply or implement any cyclical development in its vector. Because insect transmission is mechanical it is thought to be dependent on high parasitaemias in the mammalian hosts. In South America, the natural transmission of the parasite occurs mainly by mechanical transmission via flies such as _Tabanus_ spp. However a propagative transmission can be implemented via vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) in which the parasite invades and multiplies in the blood, like in any other mammalian host, before invading the salivary glands, from where it might be re-injected to a new host.
