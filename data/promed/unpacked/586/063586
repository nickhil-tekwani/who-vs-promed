[Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats (excluding _B. ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Sporadic infections caused by_ B. abortus_ or_ B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are extremely rare. Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread worldwide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are northern and central Europe, south-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Pathologically and epidemiologically, _B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle. In most circumstances, the primary routes of transmission of Brucella are the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have full-term parturition. Shedding of Brucella is also common in udder secretions and semen, and Brucella may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides and testes), and from arthritic lesions. http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf

_B. melitensis_ is also an important human pathogen. In humans, brucellosis is a serious, debilitating and sometimes chronic disease that can affect a variety of organs. Most cases are the result of occupational exposure to infected animals, but infections can also occur from ingesting contaminated dairy products. In addition, _B. melitensis_ could be used in a bioterrorist attack. http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_melitensis.pdf. - Mod.CRD
