[In a ProMED-MBDS post (<promed-mbds@promedmail.org>) concerning the dengue outbreak in Guangdong province, Mod.ST commented, "In the Asia-Pacific region where nearly 75 per cent of all dengue cases worldwide occur, one of the forces driving regional preparedness for health threats such as dengue is the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). This close-knit community of nations has developed a powerful partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) in an effort to achieve a shared goal: a healthy and secure population.

One clear sign of this cooperation was seen on 15 Jun 2011. ASEAN health ministers declared that day -- and each subsequent 15 June -- to be ASEAN Dengue Day. This important annual event allows ASEAN members, in coordination with WHO, to consolidate dengue prevention and control measures.

Integrating dengue prevention and control activities into ongoing proven capacity development activities will optimize the use of resources and facilitate sustainability. Thus, dengue may be used as a pathfinder, in the same way influenza has been and continues to be used, for further strengthening indicator-based surveillance systems in countries and for strengthening national and regional laboratory capacity. Likewise, outbreak response, regional preparedness, and other dengue-control measures are being addressed through the focus areas of the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED).

The combination of technical resources and the ability to mobilize regional mechanisms make WHO and ASEAN an effective alliance for the early detection and response to acute public health threats.

In 2010, WHO member states of the Western Pacific Region reported 354 009 cases, with 1075 deaths (case fatality rate [CFR] 0.30 per cent). This represents the highest reported number of cases since 1998. Australia, Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Viet Nam all reported more than 1000 cases in 2010. Also in 2010, WHO member states of the South East Asia Region reported 293 868 cases, with 1896 deaths (CFR 0.65 per cent). This represents the highest reported number of cases in the last 5 years (Bhutan and Nepal started reporting dengue in 2007). India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Thailand all reported more than 10 000 cases in 2010. Dengue is an emerging public health problem in Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal (http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/documents/ActionAgainstDengue.pdf.pdf)."
