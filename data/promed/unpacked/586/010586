Within several years, all blood donated in the United States will routinely
be filtered to remove white blood cells, which carry viruses that often
infect patients who receive transfusions. This follows Britain's decision
on July 17 to remove white blood cells from all donated blood to protect
against the "theoretical risk" of the new-variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (nvCJD). Several other European countries are also removing white
blood cells from stored blood, either to guard against the new variant of
CJD or as a general health safeguard. They include Ireland, France, Norway,
Portugal, and Austria.
U.S. health officials say there is no proof that nvCJD is transmitted by
blood, but they support removing white blood cells for other, compelling
general health reasons.
The special fine-mesh filters used to remove white blood cells from blood
cost $15 to $20 each, he said. One filter is needed for each transfusion.
On average, a pint of blood costs about $75 in the United States. All U.S.
blood donations are already filtered to remove blood clots and other rough
debris. But fewer than 20 percent are believed to be filtered to remove
leukocytes.
"Even if white blood cells harm only a small percentage of people, if it is
logistically easy to remove them, we should," said Dr. Harvey Klein, chief
of transfusion medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Filtration is
also advisable to prevent new pathogens from entering the blood supply, he
said.
Three components of blood are useful to patients receiving transfusions:
red blood cells, which carry oxygen; platelets, which enable blood to clot;
and plasma, the clear fluid portion of circulating blood. Leukocytes, whose
job is to rid the body of invading foreign organisms, provide no benefits
to most transfused patients but expose them to numerous health risks,
according to many health experts.
Dr. Celso Bianco, president-elect of America's Blood Centres, a nonprofit
organisation that collects and distributes donated blood said that one of
the most troublesome viruses carried by leukocytes is cytomegalovirus,
which causes serious lung and brain disorders in premature babies and can
cause pneumonia and retinitis in patients receiving organ transplants.
Transfused leukocytes also cause fevers in many transfused patients, Bianco
said, and can stimulate alloimmunization or the development in blood
recipients of antibodies that kill platelets received in future
transfusions. In addition, leukocytes transmit the human T-cell
lymphotropic virus, which has been linked to neurological disorders and a
rare form of leukaemia.
Bianco said he expects all whole blood and separated units of red blood
cells and platelets to be filtered within two to five years to remove
leukocytes or a procedure formally known as leukocyte reduction. (Plasma
does not need to be leukocyte-filtered because white blood cells are
centrifuged away in the process of separating plasma from blood.)
Mark Weinstein, hematology director for the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, said Britain's decision to remove white blood cells from
donated blood had brought the issue to the fore in the United States. He
said government and industry representatives would meet September 18 in
Bethesda, MD, to discuss whether, and how soon, the United States should
step up its level of leukocyte filtration.
