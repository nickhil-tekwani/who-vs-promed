The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating with public health and regulatory officials in several states and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate a multistate outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 (STEC O157:H7) infections or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC).

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the US national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on EHEC bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks. In this outbreak, the outbreak strain was defined by PFGE. The DNA fingerprint of the outbreak strain has never been seen before in the PulseNet database.

12 people infected with the outbreak strain of EHEC O157:H7 have been reported from 5 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Case Count Map page:

State / Case Count
------------------
Arizona / 4
California / 4
Maryland / 1
New Jersey / 1
Oregon / 2

Illnesses started on dates ranging from 6 Jan 2017 to 15 Feb 2017. Ill people range in age from 2 to 48 years, with a median age of 8. Eleven (92%) of the 12 ill people are younger than 18 years old. Among ill people, 58 per cent are male. Six ill people have been hospitalized, and 4 people developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure. No deaths have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic evidence available at this time indicates that I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter is a likely source of this outbreak. SoyNut Butter is a nut-free substitute for peanut butter. In interviews, ill people or their family members answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. All nine people reached for interview reported either eating I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter at home (5 people) in the week before they became ill or attending a childcare center that served I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter or I.M. Healthy brand granola coated with SoyNut Butter (4 people). This proportion is significantly higher than expected when compared with the approximately 6 per cent of ill people interviewed during past outbreak investigations who reported eating a ground nut butter or spread other than peanut butter.

I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter may be contaminated with _E. coli_ O157:H7 and could make people sick. CDC recommends consumers do not eat any I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter varieties or sizes or I.M. Healthy brand granola coated with SoyNut Butter. Childcare centers, schools, and other institutions should not serve I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut Butter or I.M. Healthy brand granola coated with SoyNut Butter. Multiple varieties and sizes of I.M. Healthy brand SoyNut butter and I.M. Healthy brand granola coated with SoyNut Butter are sold nationwide in stores, online, and to institutions. The products have a shelf life of 2 years.

This investigation is ongoing and quickly changing. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[ProMED-mail awaits more information regarding the scope of this outbreak. A third of the cases developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, which is a high rate of this complication even in children, usually less than 10 per cent. Some strains of EHEC can have a higher risk of HUS. - Mod.LL
