The Humane Society, says about 90 live raccoons have been discovered
suffering from canine distemper in Boulder, Colorado, and Longmont this
summer. The disease, which causes them to stagger, has killed just as many
more. The contagious disease is often fatal for dogs who have NOT been
inoculated against it.
