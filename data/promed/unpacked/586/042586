Deformed calves. Discolored crops. Purple pigs dying by the hundreds, then
decomposing quickly. The United States Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) is delving into these problems in Pennsylvania.
EPA officials will visit farms as part of a continuing effort to figure out
what is going on, said Carrie Deitzel, an EPA community-involvement
coordinator. The mystery has Montgomery County farmers scared for their
businesses and for their health. During the visits, farmers will be asked
to offer their suggestions. "We'll basically talk to them to see what their
specific concerns are, and see if they have specific places on the farms
they want included in the sampling plan," Deitzel said.
The long series of reported problems, first noted in the early 1990s, has
confounded agricultural and environmental officials. The EPA did its most
recent round of soil and water testing on the farms in January, and more
tests will be run in the next few weeks.
"The data so far does not indicate any kind of environmental or human
health emergency out there," Deitzel said. Deitzel acknowledged that the
lack of environmental danger did not mean the lack of an environmental
problem. The problem is not restricted to these parts. "This isn't an
isolated thing," said Lynn Campbell Wingert, an EPA spokeswoman.
"Throughout the mid-Atlantic region, farm animals are dying, and we don't
know why. We're going to make any connection we can to figure out what is
going on here."

One farmer, Wayne Hallowell of Douglass Township, said there was no real
way to know how many farms were involved locally because it was unlikely
every farmer would be willing to cooperate with investigators. "A lot of
farmers with something wrong won't tell anyone," Hallowell said. "They
don't want the government coming in and shutting them down, or they're
trying to sell their land. They're very tight-lipped on that."
But problems are there, enough to put farmers out of business! Tom Yarnall,
a farmer for 30 years, finally gave up raising pigs on his Gilbertsville
spread. Yarnall still grows some corn. "I had almost 1,000 pigs when this
thing started," Yarnall said. "In the spring of '92, it all went downhill.
We had whole litters die when they were born."
According to Yarnall, more than 200 pigs died during a two-month period in
1993. All had similar signs: turning a purplish color, with newborns just
not growing to maturity. His crops turned purple, and have been stunted for
several years. Yarnall said, "The yields are way down. They just don't do
well."
The pigs' bodies decomposed in about half the normal time, according to
Yarnall. *Generally, dead pigs decompose in two to seven days, depending on
the surrounding climate and other variables*, said Arlen Wilbers, a
large-animal veterinarian at the Quakertown Veterinary Clinic who examined
livestock at Yarnall's farm.
Kenneth Kephart, an associate professor of animal science at Pennsylvania
State University, investigated the goings-on at Yarnall's farm but was
unable to find clear evidence of a cause. Yarnall is not the only local
farmer facing unexplained and unusual disease among his livestock.
Merrill Mest said he had had a decade's worth [of problems] at his farm,
just a few miles from Yarnall's. "I've had health problems with cows," Mest
said. "They just waste away. They don't grow right." Other cows there have
had displaced stomachs [abomasum] and cystic ovaries. "My vet says I have a
lot more problems than I should," Mest said. "But nobody knows why."
Wilbers, who is also Mest's veterinarian, said some of the problems might
be chalked up to livestock management. Wilbers indicated some of the
happenings seemed to have external causes, but nothing was a definitive
cause.
Nearby, at Hallowell's dairy farm, 3 deformed calves were born within
eighteen months in the mid-1990s -- after nearly 50 years without any
deformed calves being born on the land. One newborn calf weighed 3 times
the typical birth weight. Another was born with testicles and with a
vagina. A third was born without a neck, without a tail and with reversed
leg joints.
During the same period, Hallowell said, several calves on his farm would
not grow. And, like Yarnall, Hallowell's corn and grass have turned an
unsettling shade of purple, and they do not reach maturity.
State Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) spokesman Pete Trosini
said the agency would review its old records on the farms' problems in
search of "any inconsistencies or anything that might raise a red flag."
Hallowell said he suspected radiation poisoning, citing the Cabot
Corporation chemical plant in Boyertown, just a few miles from his farm.
The Cabot plant uses a wide variety of chemicals in its operations, and was
listed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1992 as one of 46
sites in the United States with serious and long-term radioactive
contamination that required accelerated cleanup.
"The Boyertown site had stored in mausoleums 25,000 tons of residue product
from their operations," said Michael Lamastra, a senior project manager
with the NRC. He said the Cabot site was on the list only because of the
high cost of moving so much radioactive waste, not because of a perceived
health or environmental danger. Lamastra said the Cabot plant was removed
from the NRC list after the contaminants were transferred offsite last year.
Cabot officials said that the levels of radiation were low, and the storage
methods were proper. "I'm not aware of any incidents that could have
contributed to these types of problems," said Tony Campitelli, the plant's
manager of environmental affairs. The EPA probably will look into Cabot's
environmental record and practices as part of its investigation, Deitzel
said. But, she noted, neither DEP nor NRC had reported problems with the
firm's Boyertown plant.
The unexpected consequences that result when industrial refuse and farms
get too close to each other could provide an explanation, said Sarah
Caspar, who is the EPA's on-site coordinator for an area in Parkersburg,
W.Va., that also has seen unexplained livestock deaths. The affected farms
in that area are near a chemical company's landfill. "Part of me has this
feeling that as time has passed since industrialization, things that people
weren't aware of may be coming to the forefront because of time and
accumulation," she said.
As the riddle continues unsolved in western Montgomery County, the farmers
say they fear for their lives as well as their livelihoods.
