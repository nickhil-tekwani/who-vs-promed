Government to shoulder all costs to stop foot and mouth scourge
---------------------------------------------------------------
The administration has decided to cover the cost of all measures to tackle
foot and mouth disease [FMD] among livestock in Miyazaki Prefecture under a
special law, officials said on Monday [14 Jun 2010].

The government intends to decide on the steps, including compensation, for
farmers who have slaughtered their livestock, at a cabinet meeting Friday
[18 Jun 2010]. It expects to allocate 60 billion yen to 70 billion yen [USD
656 to 765 million] to implement the measures, the officials said.

Prime minister Naoto Kan said earlier in the day he is considering
dispatching additional Self-Defense Forces personnel and police to contain
the FMD outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture. "We are on the brink of it
spreading to the rest of Kyushu," Kan said at a meeting of a government
task force. "According to the circumstances, we will dispatch people even
if they might be in surplus to some extent," he said. "First, we will
completely stop the further spread (of the disease), and once it ends we
will also put all our efforts into rebuilding" local farmers' businesses.

So far, about 300 SDF personnel have been dispatched to Miyazaki. Chief
cabinet secretary Yoshito Sengoku told a news conference that the
government is ready to dispatch "a lot more" if requested by the
prefecture. In Miyazaki Prefecture, officials have generally been able to
secure places to bury affected livestock that have been killed, but they
are running short of people to do the work of burying the remains.
Meanwhile, businesses other than the farm industry in Miyazaki are starting
to feel the adverse effects of the FMD crisis.

According to a Miyazaki trucking association, some cargo from trucks
bearing Miyazaki number plates have been denied, while local hotel
operators said a number of group tours have been canceled. "The city of
Miyazaki is so quiet," a taxi driver said. "The only people (who use taxis)
are elderly going to hospitals."

[We should not be surprised that FMD is causing losses to branches of
Japan's economy other than agriculture. Comparative economic consequences
of a major FMD epizootic in a highly industrialised country can be sought
in several investigations and reports which followed the 2001 FMD outbreak
in the United Kingdom. According to one of them, carried out jointly by 2
ministries of the UK government, DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs - previously Agriculture) and DCMS (Department for
Culture, Media and Sport), the losses to agriculture and the food chain,
including the costs compensated by the exchequer, amounted to about GBP 3.1
billion (about USD 4.33 billion, in 2001 terms), while businesses directly
affected by tourist expenditure were estimated to lose a similar amount
(between GBP 2.7 and 3.2 billion). For the detailed document "Economic cost
of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK (DEFRA/DCMS, March 2002), see
