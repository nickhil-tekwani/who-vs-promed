Quarantine set in Okanogan County to control poultry movement
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) has adopted an emergency rule to establish a quarantine zone in parts of Okanogan County, covering an area of approximately 6 miles around a site in Riverside where avian influenza was detected in a flock of game birds.

The quarantine restricts the movement of eggs, poultry or poultry products within and out of the identified zone with exemptions made for operations that obtain special permits and meet specific criteria. Visit http://www.agr.wa.gov/lawsrules/rulemaking to see the complete rule adopted today [29 Jan 2015] and a detailed map of the quarantine.

Currently, a quarantine zone also covers part of Clallam County where a backyard flock was identified as having avian influenza. That quarantine has been in place since 21 Jan 2015. An earlier quarantine in parts of Benton and Franklin counties was lifted on 27 Jan 2015.

This most recent case of avian influenza was discovered after the flock owners contacted WSDA to report that approximately 40 pheasants and 12 turkeys had died. Samples from the birds were tested and results showed the birds were infected with avian influenza, although more detailed testing is taking place to confirm the virus strain.

Today [29 Jan 2015], a team of veterinarians from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) visited the area to contact bird owners in the immediate vicinity of the infected flock in order to obtain samples for testing. The 2 agencies are working with Okanogan County Public Health and the flock owners to develop a response plan to this latest report.

The site of the flock is under quarantine and no birds are being moved from the property. As recently as November [2014], the flock owners had tests run on their birds which, at that time, showed no sign of avian influenza in the flock.

Because migratory wild waterfowl populations can carry the disease, including the highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza (H5N2 and H5N8), WSDA is encouraging bird owners to protect their domestic birds from contact with wild waterfowl and remain vigilant in their biosecurity measures.

There is no immediate public health concern due to the avian influenza virus detected, however public health officials routinely contact owners of infected flocks as a precaution. Avian influenza does not affect poultry meat or egg products, which remain safe to eat. As always, both wild and domestic poultry should be properly cooked.

Deaths or illness among domestic birds should be reported to the WSDA Avian Health Program at 1-800-606-3056. For wild birds, contact the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife at 1-800-606-8768.

[The specific strain of avian influenza is not confirmed as of this reporting. Samples have been forwarded to the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.

Other articles are reporting this game farm may have as many as 5000 birds.

Avian influenza was confirmed in a British Columbia, Canada, poultry farm near the Washington border on 1 Dec 2014. The early part of December brought confirmation of 11 British Columbia commercial poultry operations and an 85-bird backyard flock with the virus.

Highly pathogenic bird flu was confirmed last week in the 145 000-bird Foster Farms turkey farm in Stanislaus County, California, the 1st US commercial operation to be infected.
