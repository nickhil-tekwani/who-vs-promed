Sudden mass mortality of pigeons has been detected in the city of
Chernyakhovsk, in the Kaliningrad region.

Control measures have been applied in the settlement, which is
located within the boundaries of the city of Chernyakhovsk. These
measures include quarantine, culling of all pigeons within the
infected focus and burning their carcasses.

Experts of the Territorial Management of the Russian Public Health
Service (Rospotrebnadzor) are investigating the event and the
possible sources of infection. According to the preliminary results,
the bird mortality was, most likely, caused by Newcastle disease.

[The Kaliningrad region is the most western region of Russia, along
the Baltic Sea coast between Poland and Lithuania. It is completely
separated from the rest of Russia by Lithuania, Latvia and Belarus,
bordering Poland on its south. The region has 955 000 inhabitants.

[Official confirmation by Russia's Veterinary Services is
anticipated. This should be based upon laboratory tests, while
excluding the involvement of avian influenza. - Mod.AS]
