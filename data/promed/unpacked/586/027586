[Since the last ProMED-mail update, there was a period of 10 consecutive days (21-30 Apr 2015) when no new cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported by Saudi Arabia, a marked change from the reporting of newly confirmed cases in February and March 2015. Since the last ProMED-mail update, there have been a total of 5 newly confirmed cases, of which only one gave a history of exposure to other MERS-CoV infected individuals in the 14 days preceding onset of illness (case no. 1 above). This individual was reported from Hafoof, where the previously reported case was reported on 20 Apr 2015 (see case no.4 above).

Looking at the most recent newly confirmed cases, the newly confirmed cases reported since 1 May 2015, all involve relatively young individuals (less than 45 years of age), all 3 of whom are reported to be in critical condition, and 2 of whom do not have a history of known contact with other known MERS-CoV infected individuals. It will be interesting to see a follow-up report that may contain more information on possible high-risk exposures in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

Geographically, the newly confirmed cases are from different areas; 2 are from Hafoof in the northern part of Al Sharqia province in the eastern region of the country; Huraymeila is located in the western part of Riyadh province, and Khamis Mushayet is located in the southwest of the country in Asir province. Maps showing the geographic locations of these cases can be found at the source URLs for each report. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Saudi Arabia - MOH statement 3 May 2015
Date: 3 May 2015

Ministry of Health (MoH) has announced the decline of coronavirus cases that cause Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the month of April [2015], at a rate of more than 97 percent, compared to the same period last year in 2014. The highest level of coronavirus-infected cases was recorded in the past year in April [2014], reaching 279 cases, while the number of cases did not exceed 8 cases in April of this year [2015].

MoH confirms the 6th consecutive week of decline in the number of MERS-CoV cases in the Kingdom.

Three cases were recorded during this week, 2 of them were without the standard case symptoms, during the period 7 to 13 Rajab 1436 [26 Apr 2015 to 2 May 2015 (18th International Week), said Dr. Abdulaziz Bin Saeed, Deputy Minister of Health for Public Health, Chairman of Command and Control Center (CCC).

Despite the marked decline, Dr. Bin Saeed reemphasized that we remain in season and that, as a result, the Ministry will maintain current levels of preparedness. Efforts in combating the virus will continue, with focus to be placed on cooperation with all other parties, especially the general public and healthcare providers, who are distinguished by combating this disease.

During the same period:
MoH laboratories tested 986 samples of coronavirus.
The Rapid Response Team made 7 visits to medical facilities to inspect infection prevention and control.
The Public Health team made one visit to positive, direct cases.
The total number of positive, direct cases confined at home is 7.
The Ministry launched a public awareness campaign entitled "We Can Stop This."
Latest numbers show that 552 cases from the total of 982 confirmed cases have been cured, which represents a rate of 56.2 percent.

According to Dr. Bin Saeed, the Ministry of Health's CCC will continue all efforts in combating the virus, including epidemiological monitoring. The CCC ensures the commitment of all government and private healthcare facilities in applying infection control procedures based on international best practices derived from coordination with relevant government and international health bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Ministry also continues all efforts and full coordination with the Ministry of Agriculture to implement MERS-CoV awareness campaigns among camel owners and herders.

Dr. Hael Abdali, Director General of infection control in health facilities, said that the reason for the increase of cases among community groups in the last 2 months may be due to the link with camel proliferation season, especially that the camel-breeding usually marks the cold months, November, December and January. Therefore, newly born camels have less immunity and are more prone to infection than older camels. The virus increases dramatically and thus become a source of infection.

Dr. Al Abdali cautioned that camels directly contacting people may be infected without showing symptoms of MERS, because of their strong immune system. Therefore, they may carry the virus and pass it to others who have a weak immune system, which causes MERS symptoms, especially if they do not commit to preventive and precautionary measures.

The direct contact with infected people is a cause of the dramatic infection risk increase, especially among the elderly and those who suffer from chronic diseases such as heart, lung, and kidney diseases or those who suffer from lack of immunity.

[The above report is interesting in the mention of 986 samples processed for MERS-CoV presence during the one week period 26 Apr 2015 - 2 May 2015 and the mention of an additional 2 asymptomatic infections identified during the presumed contact tracing surrounding MERS-CoV clinically symptomatic infected individuals.

In the MOH weekly update published on 26 Apr 2015, there was mention of 1008 samples having been processed for MERS-CoV presence during the one week period from 19-25 Apr 2015 (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News-2015-04-26-001.aspx).

In another announcement on 28 Apr 2015, the MOH presented the launching of a website that will aim at increasing awareness of MERS-CoV and how to prevent transmission in addition to the use of social media for communicating messages related to MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News-2015-04-28-003.aspx). - Mod.MPP]
