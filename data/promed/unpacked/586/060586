Southern rust is one of the most concerning corn diseases for the area. It was identified recently in southern and central areas of Florida and southern areas of Georgia. Rainy weather has created a perfect opportunity for disease development. The humid conditions create a damp microclimate in fields providing conducive conditions for spores to germinate and infect plants.

Fungicides with mixed modes of action tend to provide better efficacy and more robust disease protection, as well as reduce the risk of resistance development.

[Southern rust (also called polysora or tropical rust) in maize is caused by _Puccinia polysora_. The fungus occurs in most tropical and subtropical regions and can cause significant losses of over 50 percent. Southern rust is favoured by warm, humid conditions. Leaves may die prematurely reducing photosynthetic ability; therefore infection before grain fill has been completed is more damaging to yield than infection late in the crop cycle. _P. polysora_ needs living host tissue for survival and spores are wind dispersed. No alternate hosts of the fungus are known. Resistant or tolerant ('slow rusting') varieties are being developed.

The related species _P. sorghi_ causes common rust of maize.
