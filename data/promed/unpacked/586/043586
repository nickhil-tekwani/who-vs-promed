Spongiform Encephalitis (BSE) in Europe / Austria (based on information
via radio and TV). The EC (European Community) is actually discussing
the introduction of obligatory checks of all animals slaughtered.>
The EC TSE-surveillance program [European Community Transmissible
Spongiform Encephalopathy according to the decision of the Commission
98/272/EC will be continued in the year 2001 in the form amended by the
decision of the Commission 2000/374/EC.
This surveillance will include testing of slaughtered sick cattle and
fallen stock. Austria will transpose this decision, and will also do
other testing (for instance on imported animals from countries which had
cases of BSE).
countries where the occurrence of BSE has been proven, but should be
mandatory in all countries of the EC.
Austria, which has never had a case of BSE (nor a case of scrapie),
stopped using bonemeal and other animal parts for feeding cattle in 1991
and has given the order to check every animal with symptoms similar to
those of "mad cow disease" for BSE.>
Austria never had a case of BSE but had its a first case of scrapie
earlier this year.
Austria had a special situation since the end of WW II which made soybean
meal very cheap. Because of this reason it was not useful to feed MBM to
ruminants, after the appearance of BSE it was banned officially too.
Rendering plants in Austria had to use steam autoclaving (134 C) long
before the BSE crisis happened and never changed this.

The German Ministry of Agriculture stated Saturday 25 Nov 2000, after a
meeting of the "bund-laender BSE crisis commission" feeding of animals on
bone meal will be illegal in Germany, beginning Wednesday 29 Nov 2000.
The first case of BSE was confirmed by the national reference center in
Tuebingen. The Government of the State of Schleswig Holstein, were the
suspected cow was stabled, has arranged a BSE hotline.
Furthermore the press reports the first suspected case of nvCJD, a 22
year old male Bavarian patient, suffering from progression of the disease
for 18 months. The head of the Division of Neuropathology at the Munich
"Klinikum GroDFhadern", Hans Kretzschmar, could not confirm nor deny
nvCJD or sporadic form of the disease.

BERLIN - Germany authorities said a backup test confirmed the country's
first case of BSE, as anger grew towards those who had insisted the
country would remain free of the brain-wasting illness.
Heide Simonis, state premier of the northern region of
Schleswig-Holstein, said a second test by federal health authorities
confirmed the results of an earlier test on Friday.
"We have the first BSE case in Germany, here in Schleswig-Holstein,"
Simonis said, referring to the scientific name of mad cow disease, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).
The BSE cow was born in 1996 and slaughtered on 22 Nov 2000. The animal
was in a herd of 160 in Schleswig-Holstein, all of which are to be
slaughtered. A second cow exported from the eastern state of
Saxony-Anhalt to Portugal also tested positive.
"I have no idea how this could have happened," farmer Peter Lorenzen
said. "I don't think this is only my problem. A lot of farmers are
having the problem. They feed their cows the exact same way I do."
Butchers reported plunging beef sales amid calls for the resignation of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's farm and health ministers following news
at least 2, and perhaps dozens more, of the country's 15 million cows
might be infected.
In an interview on Monday, European Health Commissioner David Byrne said
German authorities "did not want to believe it possible" that BSE could
be present there. They were "very complacent" he said. "I knew it was
only a question of time" before the first case would surface.
The British government came under renewed pressure on Sunday to ban
imports of French beef, after reports of cases in France. Agriculture
Minister Nick Brown suggested there would be no such ban, saying the
disease should be addressed on a European Union basis. The disease was
first detected in Britain in the 1980s.
The German government, which resisted strict measures, reversed itself
and called for tests on cattle throughout the EU.
Agriculture Minister Karl-Heinz Funke, who last week was saying he was
"absolutely convinced" Germany was immune to BSE, on Friday demanded
fast national testing of slaughtered cattle. He later widened the call to
urge mandatory testing throughout the EU and on beef imported into the
EU.
State and federal ministers also agreed at a meeting in Bonn to back
Schroeder's call for an immediate ban on the import, export and use of
animal feeds containing meat and bonemeal.
The measure will become law on Wednesday, and Germany will push for an
EU-wide ban in December. Infected feeds have been blamed for the spread
of BSE and the human form of mad cow disease, new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD).
Butchers complained the announcement of BSE virtually halted all beef
sales.
A Dutch scientist and member of the EU's veterinary committee, Albert
Osterhaus, said he estimated there might be several dozen German cows
infected with BSE.

The spread of BSE to Germany shows the brain-wasting sickness, which is
also deadly to people, knows no national frontiers, European Health
Commissioner David Byrne said.
Speaking on German television Byrne said it was a mistake to believe
German tests and controls were sufficient to keep out BSE. He also called
for transparency to restore consumer confidence.
"Germany long had the view there could be no cases of BSE. That was wrong
and I wasn't surprised... We need transparency. It's important consumers
know hey're getting all the information available and won't be fooled."

Azores islands report first mad cow case
----------------------------------------
LISBON - Portugal has detected the first case of BSE in the Azores, a
region exempted from a European Union ban on Portuguese beef exports, the
Agriculture Ministry said. The Ministry added the Fresian cow stricken by
the disease had been imported 2 years ago to the island of Sao Miguel from
Germany, where it was born in September 1995. The cow was slaughtered on 2
Oct 2000 and the carcass destroyed immediately on presenting signs of BSE.
Local Authorities in Azores announced a radical plan to slaughter all the
imported animals (about 2000 cows).
Veterinary authorities have placed the farm under embargo and informed
their counterparts in Germany. Portugal has repeatedly protested the EU
embargo is unfair because it has stricter measures to control BSE than many
other European countries.
The Ministry says the incidence of BSE in Portugal currently stands at 200
per million, down from 240 tallied in the 12 months to September 1999, and
is on course to be eradicated by 2003.

The cow in Spain with BSE was not originally from Austria, it had
Austrian grandparents, the cow with BSE was born in the Netherlands
according to the Austrian newspaper "Salzburger Nachrichten".
