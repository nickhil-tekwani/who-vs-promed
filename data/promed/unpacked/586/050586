Potato pest investigation
-------------------------
An investigation into how a small Ottawa garlic farm became infested
with a pest called potato rot nematode will include Prince Edward
Island [PEI] even though it's highly unlikely it came from there.

PEI is the only province in Canada where the pest has previously been
found. But the areas where it appeared have been quarantined since the
1940s. So the Canadian Food Inspection Agency [CFIA] believe it's not
likely that the Ontario infestation came from PEI.

The potato rot nematode can cause significant damage to root crops and
is the bane of potato growers. A farmer who finds it faces strict
quarantine measures that will mean the end of growing crops for sale
in the affected fields. Once a farm is infested, CFIA say it's nearly
impossible to get rid of. Officials say confirming of the source of
the Ontario pest will likely take months and might not be conclusive.
The garlic farm is not near potato growers or seed producers.

[Potato rot (or tuber) nematode (PRN), _Ditylenchus destructor_, has
been reported to cause serious yield losses in potato crops in some
temperate regions. It can also affect a range of other crops,
including carrots, onion, beets, parsnips, tomato, peanut, hops, and
lucerne, as well as a number of ornamentals and weeds. On potato,
above ground plant parts do not show symptoms, but damage only becomes
obvious at harvest. Affected tubers show spotted, dry, and cracked
skin and often develop secondary soft rot. Infection occurs mostly in
the field, but tubers will continue to decay in storage as nematodes
move into healthy tissue.

Factors influencing development and spread of PRN are not yet fully
understood. Distribution in the field is erratic and difficult to
predict and outbreaks may occur suddenly. PRN can be spread with
infected soil, water, contaminated equipment, and plant material
including seed potatoes and can also spread in storage. Disease
management includes exclusion, long crop rotation with non-host
species, control of potential pathogen reservoirs, use of certified
clean seed tubers, and soil treatment with nematicides (drenching or
fumigation). Eradication of soil nematodes is extremely difficult.

The related species _D. dipsaci_ (stem and bulb nematode) is also a
serious pathogen of potato and some other vegetable crops.
