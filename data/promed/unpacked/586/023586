Raccoons on the Monterey Peninsula are facing an outbreak of distemper, the SPCA Monterey County Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Center warned on Tuesday [15 Mar 2022].

After seeing a higher than usual number of raccoons suffering from symptoms of the usually fatal disease -- particularly among populations in Marina, Seaside, Monterey and Pacific Grove -- the center sought confirmation of an outbreak by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Official testing from the department's Wildlife Health Laboratory confirmed the center's concerns.

Symptoms of distemper, which progressively worsen over time, include discharge from the nose and eyes, a rough coat, emaciation, and unusual behavior such as disorientation, appearing unable to see, loss of fear of humans, seizures, or wandering aimlessly.

To help, as well as avoid the spread of the disease to other wildlife and pets, the SPCA Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Center recommends the following:

- Ensure that your pets are vaccinated for distemper and other viruses. The SPCA Veterinary Clinic offers vaccines for USD 25 each. Appointments can be made at <www.spcamc.org>.
- Remove human-caused food and water sources for raccoons, including pet bowls and accessible garbage, to help reduce areas where raccoons can congregate and transmit the virus to each other or local pets.
- Do not attempt to touch or handle local wildlife. If you see wildlife in distress, contact the SPCA Wildlife Center.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of "shyness", and the affected can seem "dumb" and/or "friendly". Animals showing similar behavioural signs might be rabid.

In the eastern USA, the main terrestrial reservoir of rabies is raccoons (see map of distribution of major rabies virus variants among carnivores at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/wildlife_reservoirs.html).

A strategy that has been developed to control and contain the spread of rabies in raccoon is the use of oral rabies vaccination, which can be implemented by distributing bait in high priority areas of eastern USA, but not in Virginia (see https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed2030034).

It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area up to date. - Mod.PMB
