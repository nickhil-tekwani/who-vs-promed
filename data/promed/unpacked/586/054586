Bali has completed rabies vaccination phase I
---------------------------------------------
The Bali provincial government together with the Bali Animal Welfare
Association (BAWA) and the World Society for the Protection of Animals
(WSPA) has completed phase I of the rabies vaccination programme,
which has reached 70 per cent of the Bali dog population.

"We have completed phase I which was started in October 2010 and
completed in March 2011. 70 per cent of Bali's dog population,
approximately 210 000 dogs, have been vaccinated," says Janice
Girardi, BAWA founder. The last banjar [village community] to be
vaccinated was Tegal Kori Kaja, Ubung, Denpasar on Thursday (31 Mar
2011).

The cost of dog vaccination phase I was Rp. 6.7 billion [about USD
775 000 USD], which has funding from the World Society for the
Protection of Animals (WSPA). "We are optimistic that phase II will be
easier since we will not start from the beginning again," Girardi
says.

Girardi explained, that, "Initially, for vaccination phase I, we only
had 6 teams with 50 personnel to catch and vaccinate dogs in Bali. We
now have 52 teams with 420 trained personnel to catch and vaccinate
dogs." Because of the dog vaccination program, Bali now has
experienced a decrease in human rabies cases of 48 per cent in the 1st
3 month of 2011, and a 45 per cent decrease in cases of rabid dogs.

Meanwhile, Putu Sumantra, head of Bali Animal Husbandry Agency stated
that completing the vaccination program in 2 stages will enable Bali
to become rabies-free by 2012. "In Bali there are 4123 banjars which
have received dog vaccination.

[This is the 1st encouraging news regarding the rabies situation in
Bali. It is to be hoped that phase II will be equally successful and
ultimately restore Bali's rabies-free status.
