Health authorities of Nicaragua reported today that a 9-month-old became the 2nd fatality of leptospirosis so far this year [2013], due to the rains that have hit the country recently. The director of health services in Managua, Carolina Davila, said the baby was born in Managua, as was the 1st victim, a 9-year-old boy who died in late August [2013].

Leptospirosis is one of the 3 diseases for which the Government of Nicaragua maintains a national epidemiological emergency. The others are dengue and influenza. The official gave no details about the death of the baby; only that the family reported his death and the authorities confirmed that it was due to leptospirosis.

Earlier last month [August 2013], Nicaragua initiated a massive removal of rats in more than 64 percent of the country to prevent leptospirosis, with an investment of USD 161 000. According to the authorities, the goal is to apply 20 300 kg of Biorat in 862 locations in 120 municipalities in the country.

The distribution of Biorat in municipalities threatened by leptospirosis in Nicaragua was named by the Government as the VI Deratting Campaign. So far this year [2013], the Government has already implemented 17 976 kilograms of Biorat.

[_Leptospira_ bacteria are shed in urine of many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_. _Leptospira_ may survive in water or moist soil for weeks to months. Inadequate disposal of garbage and debris provides a suitable habitat for rat infestation in urban settings. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Managua receives most of its rainfall between May and October.

The news release above states that to control leptospirosis, Nicaragua is using the rodenticide Biorat manufactured by Labiofam (Laboratorios Biologicos y Farmaceuticos), a Cuban pharmaceutical laboratory. The following on the rodenticide Biorat is extracted from moderator ML's comments in the prior ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - Nicaragua: (LE) 20100925.3464:

This rodenticide is "reportedly harmless if consumed by other animals or human beings" (US-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. Economic eye on Cuba, 22-28 Feb 1999. [cited 2004 Mar 31]. Available at http://www.cubatrade.org/eyeonz26.html).

However, Biorat is a salmonella-based rodenticide that is made by coating rice grains with a combination of live _Salmonella enterica_ serotype Enteritidis, phage type (PT) 6a and warfarin (see Painter JA, et al: _Salmonella_-based Rodenticides and Public Health. Emerg Infect Dis 2004 June [date cited]. Available at http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol10no6/03-0790.htm). _S._ Enteritidis can cause severe diarrheal illness, which can be life threatening, especially among children, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons. The _S._ Enteritidis strain found in Biorat is similar to the strain found in Ratin, a discontinued European product that caused human illness. Investigators from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark warn against use of Biorat as the Biorat strain is likely to be as pathogenic to humans as the Ratin strain (see Painter JA, et al: _Salmonella_-based Rodenticides and Public Health. Emerg Infect Dis 2004 June [date cited].
