Falciparum malaria in Bengal
----------------------------
The government has taken over the job of making public the data on Bengal's
vectorborne diseases. But inside the Kolkata Municipal Corporation [KMC],
which is to provide the raw figures to the government, some reshuffling has
been done as well.

Chief municipal health officer (CMHO) Deb Dwaipayan Chattopadhyay had his
wings clipped for fudging figures and was told that no data will now be
given to him. Everything will be routed through the Integrated Disease
Surveillance Programme (IDSP) department of KMC, headed by Basudeb
Chattopadhyay.

After being accused by the government of deliberately suppressing data,
Chattopadhaya was forced to issue an inter-departmental circular, asking
all reports from 83 malaria clinics of the civic body and several private
clinics to be sent to the IDSP department, where the figures of the KMC
malaria clinics will be compiled with the data received from several
state-run hospitals and private nursing homes. The compiled data will be
sent to the state health department for scrutiny by the state health officials.

Earlier, the KMC was asked to reveal the actual data by Sanchita Bakshi,
director, state health services, who said that no figure on the vectorborne
diseases coming from the KMC was authentic.

Chattopadhaya has been forced to reveal the actual data after several KMC
health officials complained to Municipal Commissioner Alapan Bandyopadhaya.
They had reportedly said that Chattopadhaya deliberately suppressed to
cover up the failure of the KMC health department in preventing and
combating the outbreak.

Significantly, the report till [29 Sep 2008], sent to the state health
department, reveals that 25 109 people have been afflicted with vectorborne
diseases, with 1476 positive cases of falciparum malaria. But after the
actual data were released, figures of afflicted cases went up to 41 223,
with 4781 cases of falciparum [malaria].

The contradiction clearly points out how the facts have been fudged. Mayor
Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, however, is not yet ready to accept that any
fact has been suppressed by the KMC health department. "Facts related to
vectorborne diseases have not been suppressed deliberately. Earlier, we did
not receive some data from the private clinics and private nursing homes.
As of now, we have received reports from some private clinics and nursing
homes. So, the data took a jump," he said.

"Compared to the previous years, the situation in the state is not that
grave. But the danger is there and there is no need to be complacent. We
are carrying regular audits as cases are being reported to us," said state
health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra. "There was a lot of backlog, which has
been cleared and KMC's data report has got the updated figure," he added.

[India reported 725 502 cases of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria in 2007
out of a total of 1 476 562 cases (World Malaria Report 2008;
<http://www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008/>).

East Bengal has always had higher _P. falciparum_ rates than the eastern
parts of India. West Bengal is close to Chhattisgarh, where we reported an
outbreak of malaria last month (Malaria, falciparum - India: (Chhattisgarh)
20081022.3344). These 2 reports indicate that _P. falciparum_ malaria is
emerging in eastern India and indicate that reported numbers are much lower
than the real numbers.
