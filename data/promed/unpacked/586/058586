Over 100 Tajiks feared to have typhoid
-------------------------------------
Over 100 people are thought to have caught typhoid in Tajikistan's capital,
Dushanbe, after heavy rains cut water supplies to the city of 1 million
last week, a doctor said on Wed 21 Jul 2004.
Tajikistan appealed for international help on Thu 15 Jul 2004, after
un-seasonal torrential rains left its capital without drinking water, and,
washed away large sections of key roads, while a mud slide cut off several
villages.
Dushanbe's water supplies have been restored, but officials warn residents
not to drink the water, which is still dark in color and contains silt and mud.
"Yesterday [Tue 20 Jul 2004] alone we received 53 people suspected of
contracting typhoid. Another 121 people arrived at the end of last week,
2/3 of them with typhoid," said a doctor at Dushanbe's only isolation
hospital, requesting anonymity.
Infections due to poor sanitation are common in Tajikistan. In 1997, a
typhoid outbreak killed around 80 people, and infected 10 000, after the
disease spread through run-down water systems.
Dushanbe and other towns often lack cash to buy water disinfection
equipment, and rural areas fare even worse.
The UN Development Program, and other international aid bodies, have
provided USD 150 000 to disinfect water in Dushanbe, a local UN spokesman
said.
