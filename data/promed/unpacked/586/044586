Paula Menzies (Canada): Q fever and coxiellosis in Canada
---------------------------------------------------------
Although small ruminant numbers are lower in Canada than in other
countries, in Ontario sheep and goats are often raised in confinement
situations with high stocking densities.

Reported human Q fever (notifiable) cases are low in Ontario.
Coxiellosis (Q fever) is not reportable in animals, but annually
notifiable. No action is taken by the federal or provincial
governments after diagnosis. No routine surveillance in animals is
currently performed.

Outbreaks of human Q fever are usually related to visiting farms and
fairs and outbreaks of abortion in sheep and goats due to _Coxiella_
-- but human disease has been associated with parturient cats with no
contact with livestock. No human cases have been linked to infection
in cattle; but there are links with wildlife, such as, snaring hares.
After the cod fishery collapsed, Newfoundland imported goats to start
a dairy goat industry. The outbreak of coxiellosis associated with
mixing of these introduced animals resulted in 80 cases of human Q
fever in the surrounding community.

Coxiellosis -- the disease in animals -- is unlikely to become
reportable in Canada. Q fever in humans is likely under-diagnosed in
general. Better communication of the risks of this infection to
medical health professionals and the public in general, is needed. A
sero-prevalence study in sheep and goat flocks and their caregivers
is commencing in May [2010] in Ontario. This will help to clarify the
importance of the infection in this province.

[The CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) website
(<http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/anima/disemala/guidee.shtml>)
includes 3 lists of animal diseases:

1. A list of the (32) reportable animal diseases (as mentioned by Dr
Menzies, Q fever not included).
Animal owners, veterinarians and laboratories are required to
immediately report the presence of an animal that is contaminated or
suspected of being contaminated with one of these diseases to a CFIA
district veterinarian. Control or eradication measures will be
applied immediately.

2. Immediately notifiable diseases (for laboratories only).
In general, immediately notifiable diseases are diseases exotic to
Canada for which there are no control or eradication programs.
The CFIA can undertake control measures for such diseases when
notified of their presence in Canada. This category also includes
some rare indigenous diseases. A herd or flock of origin must be
certified as being free from these diseases in order to meet import
requirements of trading partners.

3. Annually notifiable diseases (for laboratories only; Q fever included).
Annually notifiable diseases are diseases for which Canada must
submit an annual report to the World Organisation for Animal Health
(OIE) indicating their presence within Canada. In general, they are
diseases that are present in Canada, but are not classified as
reportable or immediately notifiable.
