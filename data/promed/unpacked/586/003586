Health personnel in Baringo are on high alert after a 50 year old man
succumbed to a condition suspected to be yellow fever [YF] in Kapluk
area. Baringo North District medical officer of health Felix Atisa,
however, dismissed the claim that the man was killed by yellow fever.
"A blood specimen taken to the Kenya Medical Research Institute
(KEMRI) did not reveal any traces of yellow fever, but he may have
died of haemorrhagic fever," said Dr Atisa. Addressing the press in
Kabarnet on Saturday [23 Apr 2011], Dr Atisa said a team of disease
surveillance officials had been deployed to the area to monitor the
situation.

"We urge the locals who develop symptoms of the disease like
headache, joint aches, and fever to seek medical attention
immediately," said the medical officer, who added that all health
facilities had been stocked with enough drugs in case of any
emergency. He said that a mass vaccination programme will soon be
rolled out in the area. The last time such an exercise was carried out
in Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet was in 2001.

Dr Atisa's sentiments contradicted those of Kabarnet District
Hospital medical superintendent Robert Pukose, who said the man died
from haemorrhagic fever "which is common among patients with yellow
fever." Addressing the press in his office, Dr Pukose said that a
postmortem examination at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in
Eldoret confirmed the cause of death to be yellow fever. Dr Pukose
said investigations on another person who died on Friday last week
indicated that he suffered from hepatitis B, which co-exists with
yellow fever.

Yellow fever is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by
infected mosquitoes. The "yellow" in the name refers to the jaundice
that affects some patients. According to the World Health
Organization, there is no cure for yellow fever. Treatment aims at
reducing the symptoms for the comfort of the patient. Vaccination is
the most important preventive measure against the disease. Yellow
fever vaccines provide immunity for a period of 10 years.

Residents of Salawa, Kapluk, Barwessa, and Seretunin claimed 5 people
have died within the last 5 months with yellow fever-related symptoms.
But Dr Pukose dismissed the claim, saying that they were based on
hearsay. "The victim from Seretunin died after taking rat poison and a
child from Salawa died from severe malaria; there is no evidence that
they died from yellow fever," said the medic.

Dr Pukose said the lower regions of Baringo and Elgeyo Marakwet were
particularly prone to yellow fever and appealed to the government to
conduct another mass vaccination against the disease this year. He
advised the residents to ensure that bushes and empty cans around
their compounds were cleared since they were conducive environments
for the breeding of mosquitoes.

According to Dr Pukose, yellow fever symptoms include fever,
headache, backache, joint and muscle pains and yellowness of the eyes
in severe cases.

[This situation is not clear. The diagnostic tests used by KEMRI (a
WHO Collaborating Center for Arbovirus and Hemorrhagic Fever Reference
and Research) that discarded YF as the etiologic agent in this case
are not specified, nor is the basis on which the postmortem
examination at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital confirmed YF virus
infection. ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving additional
information about this case, or any new hemorrhagic fever cases, as it
becomes available.

In any event, given that this is an area subject to sporadic YF
outbreaks, a vaccination campaign is prudent, especially if the last
campaign was 10 years ago, and children born since then, as well as
those missed by that earlier campaign, are at risk of YF virus
infections.
