[Anthrax is rarely reported in Sicily: 2 outbreaks in 1997 and 1 in 2014. Why we are seeing these scattered outbreaks in places and areas seldom afflicted is unclear. Logically it is not new, just a more informed livestock industry better able to recognize and report unexpected deaths than their usual less sensitive state. Hopefully, this presages the eradication of anthrax in Italy.
