So, can we suppose that, with an (hypothetical) elimination of _Aedes
aegypti_, dengue viruses would be eliminated from Asia? Perhaps the
socioeconomic situation of crowded populations in Asia (and in some parts
of Brazil) is so bad now that even _Ae. albopictus_ could be efficient
enough to transmit the viruses. Does this mean that Brazilian sanitary
authorities should not be worried [about _Ae. albopictus_ dispersion in
Brazil? This should be very well [defined, to decide if money must be
spent only with _Ae. aegypti_ or with both _Aedes_ species.
