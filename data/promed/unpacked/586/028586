Rare bird falls to avian malaria
-----------------------------
An extremely rare Hawaiian bird has died in captivity, possibly marking the
extinction of its species only 31 years after it was first discovered.
The Po'o-uli, which was suffering from avian malaria, belonged to one of
the world's most threatened bird families -- the Hawaiian
honeycreepers. 13 other honeycreeper species have already died out, in
what some are calling Hawaii's extinction crisis. Many species are in
decline due to habitat loss and introduced predators.
"The tragic death of this bird means that we may now be too late to prevent
the addition of the Po'o-uli to the depressingly long list of recent
extinctions in Hawaii, " said Stuart Butchart, of BirdLife International.
"It should serve as a wake-up call to redouble our efforts to save Hawaii's
threatened species."
Failed plans
----------
The small, stocky, brown Po'o-uli (_Malamprosops phaeosoma_) was first
discovered in 1973, in Maui's Ko'olau Forest Reserve. Even then it was
desperately endangered, with an estimated population of fewer than 200
individuals.
Since then, its decline has been steep. In 1995, fewer than 7 birds were
known, and by 1997 that number had dropped to just 3 individuals.
This species was a unique part of Earth's history -- we'll never have
another like it Eric VanderWerf, US Fish and Wildlife Service. However,
none of these 3 remaining Po'o-uli seemed keen to breed, and each
maintained a distinct home range in Hanawi Natural Area Reserve and the
immediately adjacent Haleakala National Park.
In 2002, one of the 3 individuals was caught and placed in the range of
another, in an attempt to get them to mate. But the plan failed and the
introduced bird soon left the area. The following year conservationists
decided to take drastic action and capture all 3 birds to begin a captive
breeding programme. But this proved difficult, and only one bird was
caught in September 2004, which is the individual that has just died.
Search efforts
-----------
On Tuesday a hunt began for the 2 remaining birds -- believed to be a male
and a female -- but they have not been seen for nearly a year and hopes for
their survival are slim.
"This species was a unique part of Earth's history," said Eric VanderWerf,
of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. "We'll never have another one like it
if it disappears. "I kind of liken it in some way to the loss of the Mona
Lisa or the Sistine Chapel. If we lost that we could never get it back."
Tissue samples from the dead bird were saved for possible cloning in the
future; it could be the species' only hope.
As well as habitat loss, Hawaii's massive bird losses are blamed on
introduced mosquitoes, which carry diseases like avian malaria.
On top of the Po'o-uli, a further 7 species of Hawaiian honeycreeper are
classified as Critically Endangered, with another endemic land bird, the
Hawaiian Crow, now considered to be Extinct in the Wild.
"Hawaii's bird extinction crisis is a global tragedy that is largely being
ignored," said George Fenwick, President of American Bird
Conservancy. "That the world's wealthiest nation is allowing bird
extinctions to continue, largely unchecked, is unconscionable."
