It was not a mosquito that killed the 4-year-old [Italian] girl who died on September 4 [2017] OF malaria at the Spedali Riuniti in Brescia. From the earliest rumors about the results of the tests carried out by the technical advisers on behalf of the Prosecutor's Office of Trento, a surprising result underline the need to reconstruct what really happened since the girl came to Santa Chiara hospital in Trento until the transfer to Brescia.

The strain of the malarial parasite that has infected the girl corresponds to that identified in 2 girls from Burkina Faso, who were hospitalized in Trentino the same week. They had just returned from a family trip to their country of origin, where the disease is endemic.

The hypothesis is, therefore, that the infection was the tragic mistake of a healthcare provider. A wrong medical procedure carried out during the withdrawal caused the blood of one of the 2 girls to contaminate that of [S]. A fatal accident, therefore, occurred through a needle used incorrectly.

Investigators are arriving at this conclusion based on the findings of the Prosecutor's Office of Trento, and the opinions requested from the Italian Institute of Health and the Zooprophylactic Institute of Veneto. Only then can it be explained how the parasite strain, the _Plasmodium falciparum_ that killed [S], was identical to that of the 2 patients from Burkina Faso, cured and discharged.

In fact, the parasite is transmitted from one person to another only through a carrier, a particular species of the Anopheles mosquito, absent in Italy, especially in the North, as have been confirmed the insect captures in the area. It is theoretically possible that a mosquito arrived at Santa Chiara inside a suitcase that came by plane from Africa, but the hypothesis was ruled out by examining the travel history of the Burkina family.

From August 5 to 13 [2017], the family spent a holiday in a tourist village in Bibione, Veneto. The girl did not feel well, and after a visit to the local emergency room and then to the hospital in Portogruaro, from 16 to 21 [Aug] she was admitted to Pediatrics in Trento. Few rooms away are 2 girls from Burkina Faso with malaria. The 31st [August] the patient returns to a health center in Trento with high fever. Initial diagnosis is reassuring: laryngitis. Having never left Italy, no one thinks that it can be a tropical infection, but the biologist of the laboratory finds _Plasmodium falciparum_. [S] is about to enter the coma.

They transfer her to Brescia where she dies on [Mon 4 Sep 2017]. The investigations are coordinated by the Prosecutor of Trento, Marco Gallina. An analysis of the blood samples work done by the NAS group in Trento. Healthcare workers are being interrogated. In the meantime, entomologists consider excluding transmission by mosquito-vectors, both in Trento and in Bibione. Everything is fine also in the camping [Bibione, Veneto]. Doubts and controversies focus on needles used to administer insulin and measuring blood sugar, which are performed with disposable needles. Eventually the answer is to be found in the hospital.

[The finding that the parasites in the Italian girl and the Bukina Faso patients are identical exclude that that the girl was infected by mosquitoes neither in Bibione, Veneto, which had the temperature to allow _P. falciparum_ to develop in mosquitoes and also in Trento, which the weather was too cold for development of _P. falciparum_ to take place, at least outside. The investigation of the hospital will hopefully identify why such a bloodborne cross infection apparently by needles could take place. - Mod.EP
