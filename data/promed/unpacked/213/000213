Hemorrhagic disease (HD, epizootic hemorrhagic disease, EHD), an
insectborne, infectious, and non-contagious disease of wild ruminants was
diagnosed as the cause of many white-tailed deer deaths in the Big Horn
Basin 6 years ago; the disease may be back.
Landowners, hunters, and Wyoming Game and Fish Department personnel in the
Greybull and Lovell areas have reported seeing several sick, dying, and/or
dead pronghorn and white-tailed deer.
Three pronghorn were recently collected and transported to the Wyoming
State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie for necropsy. The results revealed
that the animals had the classic lesions associated with hemorrhagic
disease. Cynthia Tate, assistant wildlife veterinarian for the Wyoming Game
and Fish Department, performed the necropsies.
Although at the present time the outward signs observed of sick pronghorn
and the early necropsy results point toward an outbreak of HD, it takes
about 2 weeks to isolate the virus. "I am pursuing other avenues for
confirming the diagnosis, but for now, it's safe to say that the pronghorns
sent down are highly suspect cases of hemorrhagic disease," Tate said.
Summer conditions have been ideal for an outbreak of the disease according
to Tate. Temperatures in the Big Horn Basin were very hot, which results in
pronghorn and white-tailed deer concentrating around water sources in the
lowland environment of the no-see-um gnats. The gnats then spread the virus
when biting the animals," Tate said.
When 1st infected, an animal looks healthy and normal. As the disease
progresses, the animal begins to look weak and ill. The virus can cause
spontaneous hemorrhaging (bleeding) in muscles and organs 5 to 10 days
after an animal is infected. Lungs become fluid-filled, and the animal may
foam at the mouth. Often, an infected pronghorn or deer will develop sores
on the mouth and tongue area. In many cases, death occurs soon after these
signs occur.
The impact the disease will have on pronghorn and white-tailed deer in the
Lovell and Greybull areas will not be known for some time. "In 2001,
hemorrhagic disease reduced the white-tailed deer population along the
Shoshone, Bighorn, and Greybull Rivers significantly," said Kevin Hurley,
Cody region wildlife coordinator. "There is really nothing we can do but
wait and see," Hurley added.
Hurley expects the mortalities to continue until several days after our 1st
hard frost. "A hard frost will kill the no-see-um gnats, which carry the
disease. Mortalities will continue for a short period because animals
infected prior to the frost may succumb to the virus," he said.
With pronghorn and archery deer seasons underway, some hunters may be
concerned about health risks. Tate assures hunters that they do not have to
worry about getting the disease from their pronghorn or deer. "As always,
obviously sick animals are not suitable for human consumption due to rapid
deterioration of the meat and other issues, but an apparently healthy
animal harvested during an HD outbreak is no problem. Humans can't get
hemorrhagic disease and neither can most other wildlife," Tate said.

Nearly 200 white-tailed deer have died in New Jersey recently after
becoming infected by a virus passed on by small insects, state officials said.
Evidence of the virus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), was 1st spotted
in New Jersey about 6 weeks ago by a hunter who came upon 15 dead deer on a
hunting club property in Somerset County, The New York Times reported in
Tuesday's [9 Oct 2007] editions.
Officials said the outbreak is not expected to seriously diminish the
state's deer population, estimated at 150 000. Larry Herrighty, assistant
director of the Department of Environmental Protection's Division of Fish
and Wildlife, said the disease, which causes fevers and mouth, nose and eye
bleeding, is affecting a "relatively small number compared to prior
outbreaks." The disease killed 4000 deer in the state 1999 and about 1000
in the 1970s, he said.
About 65 deer have died in Hillsborough Township, and another 104 have died
in and around Burlington County's Wharton State Forest, Herrighty said.
Suspected cases have also popped up in Morris, Middlesex, Camden,
Cumberland and Salem counties, the newspaper reported.
Wildlife officials say the virus hasn't spread to livestock, and while it
appears the disease does not affect humans, they are urging hunters to
avoid the meat of deer that seem sick.
The virus, which has also had outbreaks in Kentucky, Tennessee, Indiana,
Virginia, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, is usually contained after the
season's 1st frost kills the midges that carry it, officials said.
