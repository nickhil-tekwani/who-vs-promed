The directorate of agricultural services in the state of Constantine registered a new outbreak of brucellosis among cattle in the Djebel El Ouahch district. The number of people infected with this disease in Bouziane Hamma increased to 7, and the directorate decided to impose strict penalties and implement legal procedures for every seller of milk and milk products who did not comply with the protocol.

The veterinary inspector, Dr. Bin Amer Murad, confirmed that the analyzes conducted at the level of cows in the Djebel El Ouahch district showed that 8 heads had been infected with brucellosis. The doctor also issued an appeal to citizens urging them to stop consuming unpasteurized milk and other dairy products, which comes directly from an unreliable source, because it endangers their lives.

The veterinary doctor at the Municipal Office of the Directorate of Agricultural services in Hamma Bouziane, Ramadhani Layla, confirmed that the disease was discovered after receiving a letter from the Infectious Diseases Department of Hamma Bouziane Hospital about the infection of 3 people with brucellosis. The spokeswoman added that 2 shops caused the infection of patients, one of which was located in the neighborhood of Shu'bat al-Madhobh and the 2nd in the center of the city of Hamma Bouziane. The analyzes confirmed the presence of the bacteria causing the disease, and the 2 shops were closed.

[As in other North African countries, brucellosis is endemic and enzootic in Algeria. The consumption of raw milk and milk products that have not undergone pasteurization is the most common route of human infection in these countries. Similar events were reported by ProMED in 2021 in other Algerian provinces (Jijel, M'Sila, Batna, and Bouira).

Brucellosis is one of the world's major zoonoses. A bacterial infection that spreads from animals to people, it is common to many mammal species (sheep, goats, cattle, pigs, dogs, etc.) and humans. Several species of _Brucella_ have been identified with various specificities. _Brucella abortus_ affects cattle, _Brucella melitensis_ affects small ruminants, and _Brucella suis_ affects pigs. _Brucella melitensis_ is the most prevalent species causing human brucellosis. - Mod.SF]

[It will be helpful to obtain information on the species (_B. abortus_ or _B. melitensis_) involved in the Algerian outbreaks; see also item 2. - Mod.AS

Tests for brucellosis, applied in the large dairy cattle herd in Revivim, have detected one more positive cow, additional to the one reported last week. Another 3 cows were found suspects. The findings underline the importance of continuous, intensive surveillance in herds situated in close proximity to sheep and goat flocks that are not subject to periodic veterinary inspections.

Recently, a disposal site with carcasses of small ruminants was found 300 m [984 ft] from the Revivim dairy cattle operation. The carcasses were suspected to come from flocks in the Bedouin settlement Bir Hadaj, less than 3 km [1.9 mi] from Revivim (map at https://tinyurl.com/kz9aj84w).

[For the locations of Revivim and Bir Hadaj, see map at https://tinyurl.com/kz9aj84w. The distance between them is less than 3 km [1.9 mi].

The Revivim dairy cattle operation in southern Israel is one of the country's 10 leading milk-producing enterprises, counting more than 2000 animals, including about 1300 lactating cows. In October 2015, this herd was found infected by _B. melitensis_. The discovery was preceded by the identification of human infection among its personnel (see 20151031.3757610 and subsequent postings; in total, 5 human cases were diagnosed). Control measures, including movement restrictions, were undertaken, and a "test and slaughter" policy was applied. A secondary infection was discovered in another dairy farm that had purchased calves from Revivim earlier.

During the initial eradication activities, until 2016, more than 200 positive cows were culled. Sporadic new cases have been identified during the subsequent years in spite of the biosecurity measures applied, testing periodically performed, and calf vaccination policy re-instated.

At present, 7 out of Israel's (about) 700 dairy farms are known to be infected with _B. melitensis_, of which 5 are in the southern region, where grazing small ruminants are abundant. The leakage of _B. melitensis_ into dairy cattle operations reflects the worsening of the brucellosis situation among Israel's sheep/goats, as described in detail in posting 20150801.3550984. This should not surprise; in various Mediterranean countries (for example, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Egypt, Turkey, Algeria), _B. melitensis_ has been regularly isolated from cattle that were in direct or indirect contact with infected sheep and/or goats.

The continuous circulation of _B.melitensis_ in Israel's extensively-held sheep and goat flocks has been attributed to insufficient control measures and vaccination coverage (by the 'Rev 1' vaccine). This circulation has led to increased number of human cases ("Malta fever").

During the 1st 16 weeks of 2021 (as of 24 Apr 2021), 31 human cases have been reported by the Ministry of Health, compared to 27 during the same period in 2020. The total number of human cases officially reported during 2020 was 272. It is estimated that the factual number of infections is at least 10-fold of the officially reported, hospitalised cases.

The issue has become subject to deliberations in the Knesset (Israel's parliament) and to a criticizing report by the State Comptroller in the 2018 annual issue (https://tinyurl.com/r48shtpe; click page 831 for PDF or Word documents; in Hebrew). The State Veterinary Services are obliged to cope with budget deficiencies and the privatisation of State agencies, which, in particular, affected activities in backyard and extensively held flocks. - Mod.AS
