Increase in Human Cases of Tularemia -- Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming, January-September 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tularemia is a rare, often serious disease caused by a gram-negative coccobacillus, _Francisella tularensis_, which infects humans and animals in the Northern Hemisphere (1). Approximately 125 cases have been reported annually in the USA during the last 2 decades (2). As of 30 Sep 2015, a total of 100 tularemia cases were reported in 2015 among residents of Colorado (n = 43), Nebraska (n = 21), South Dakota (n = 20), and Wyoming (n = 16) (Figure [for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). This represents a substantial increase in the annual mean number of 4 (975 percent increase), 7 (200 percent), 7 (186 percent) and 2 (70 percent) cases, respectively, reported in each state during 2004-2014 (2).

Patients ranged in age from 10 months to 89 years (median = 56 years); 74 were male. The most common clinical presentations of tularemia were respiratory disease (pneumonic form, [n = 26]), skin lesions with lymphadenopathy (ulceroglandular form, [n = 26]), and a general febrile illness without localizing signs (typhoidal form, [n = 25]). Overall, 48 persons were hospitalized, and 1 death was reported, in a man aged 85 years. Possible reported exposure routes included animal contact (n = 51), environmental aerosolizing activities (n = 49), and arthropod bites (n = 34); a total of 41 patients reported 2 or more possible exposures.

Clinical presentation and severity of tularemia depends on the strain, inoculation route, and infectious dose. Tularemia can be transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals (e.g., rabbits or cats); ingestion of contaminated food, water, or soil; inhalation from aerosolization (e.g., landscaping, mowing over voles, hares, and rodents, or other farming activities); or arthropod bites (e.g., ticks or deer flies) (1,3). Human-to-human transmission has never been demonstrated (1,3).

Infected persons can develop a range of symptoms that display several clinical forms. These include fever and chills with muscle and joint pain (typhoidal), cough or difficulty breathing (pneumonic), swollen lymph nodes with or without skin lesions (ulceroglandular or glandular), conjunctivitis (oculoglandular), pharyngitis (oropharyngeal), or abdominal pain with vomiting and diarrhea (intestinal) (2,3). Symptoms typically begin within 3-5 days of exposure, but can take up to 14 days to appear. Case fatality rates range from less to 2 percent to 24 percent, depending on the strain (1-3). Streptomycin is considered the drug of choice on the basis of historical use and Food and Drug Administration approval; however, it sometimes can be difficult to obtain and is associated with frequent ototoxicity (3). Gentamicin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin are also used (2,3).

_F. tularensis_ is commonly isolated in culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction from patients' blood specimens, but can also be identified in specimens from skin lesions, spinal fluid, lymph nodes, and respiratory secretions (2). In addition, a serologic diagnosis can be made by demonstrating a fourfold increase between immunoglobulin G titers from patients in the acute and convalescent stages of infection. Specimens suspected of containing _F. tularensis_ should be handled at biosafety level 2 at a minimum. Biosafety level 3 containment is recommended when handling live cultures (2,3).

Although the cause for the increases in tularemia cases in Colorado, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming is unclear, possible explanations might be contributing factors, including increased rainfall promoting vegetation growth, pathogen survival, and increased rodent and rabbit populations. Increased awareness and testing since tularemia was reinstated as a nationally notifiable disease in January 2000 is also a possible explanation for the increase in the number of cases in these 4 states (4). Health care providers should be aware of the elevated risk for tularemia within these states* and consider a diagnosis of tularemia in any person nationwide with compatible signs and symptoms. Residents and visitors to these areas should regularly use insect repellent, wear gloves when handling animals, and avoid mowing in areas where sick or dead animals have been reported.

[Tularemia is a classic zoonosis, capable of being transmitted by aerosol, direct contact, ingestion, or arthropods. Inhalation of aerosolized organisms (as in the laboratory or as an airborne agent in an act of bioterrorism) can produce a pneumonic form. Direct contact with or ingestion of infected carcasses of wild animals (such as cottontail rabbits) can produce the ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, oropharyngeal (local lesion with regional inflammation of a lymph node), or typhoidal form. Immersion in or ingestion of contaminated water can result in infection in aquatic animals. Ticks can maintain infection transstadially and transovarially. Transstadial transmission occurs when a pathogen remains with the vector from one life stage ("stadium") to the next. Transovarial or transovarian transmission occurs in certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing bacteria from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod, which makes them an efficient reservoir as well as a vector. Recognized vectors in the USA include _Dermacentor andersoni_ (wood tick), _Amblyomma americanum_ (lone star tick), _Dermacentor variabilis_ (dog tick), and _Chrysops discalis_ (deer fly).

Tularemia does not spread from person to person essentially in contradiction to another Category A bioterrorism agent, _Yersinia pestis_, in which the pneumonic form can easily be transmitted. - Mod.LL
