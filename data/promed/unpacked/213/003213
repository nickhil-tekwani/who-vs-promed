Background: Schools provide critical educational and health benefits to children, and reopening them facilitates parents', particularly mothers', return to work (1; see source URL for complete references). Although children rarely have severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness, they can transmit infection (2).

Objective: To determine the prevalence of risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness among teachers and adults living with school-aged children.

Methods and findings: We analyzed nationally representative data from the 2018 National Health Interview Survey. We used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's criteria (3) to define "definite" and "possible" risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, including differing severities of obesity, and tabulated their prevalence among 3 groups: employed adults other than teachers, adults employed as teachers, and adults living with school-aged (aged 5 to 17 years) children. We assessed differences in the prevalence of definite or possible risk factors among adults living with children according to the children's ages (5 to 10 years vs 11 to 17 years), race/ethnicity, and family income using bivariate logistic regressions.

The National Health Interview Survey sample included 14 097 adults representative of 150.3 million US nonteacher workers; 592 adults representative of 5.8 million primary, secondary, and special education teachers; and 5682 adults representative of 69.7 million adults living with school-aged children.

Among teachers, 39.8% had definite and 50.6% had definite or possible risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness (Table 1; available at source URL). Although only 0.7% had cancer, 27.9% had a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater, 4.2% had a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater, and 8.0% had a cardiac condition. The prevalence of most risk factors was similar among nonteacher workers, although more were smokers; 41.4% had any definite risk factors, and 55.8% had definite or possible risk factors.

Among the 69.74 million adults living with school-aged children, 41.0% had definite and 54.0% had definite or possible risk factors, including 2.50 million who were older than 64 years, 4.67 million with heart disease, 4.84 million with type 2 diabetes, and more than 600 000 with cancer.

The prevalence of risk factors was similar among adults living with younger versus older children (Table 2; available at source URL). Adults living with children in low-income households were more likely to be at risk than those in higher-income households, as were those residing with Black children; adults living with Asian children or children of other races/ethnicities were at lowest risk.

Discussion: About 40 million US adults who work or live with school-aged children have definite or possible risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, a number that excludes 4.4 million nonteachers working at schools and 1.6 million daycare workers (Himmelstein DU, unpublished data). Adults living with Black children and those living with children in low-income households are at especially high risk; teachers' risk seems similar to that of other working adults.

By mid-March 2020, 107 nations had closed schools to help contain the COVID-19 outbreak (4); many that have suppressed the virus are now reopening them. In-person instruction is preferable for children's educational and social development, and school closures may adversely affect children's mental health, food security, and safety (1). Moreover, children rarely develop severe COVID-19 disease. However, as our findings indicate, school leaders must weigh these undoubted benefits against the risk to the adults who care for children, particularly older children who commonly transmit the infection (younger children are about one-third as likely to cause household spread) (2). Both the risks and benefits of schools reopening are likely larger for poor and Black families.

Our study has limitations. We could not identify school personnel other than teachers or daycare workers in the National Health Interview Survey, nor could we identify some conditions identified as risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness, such as chronic kidney disease or thalassemia. Hence, our estimate of the number of adults at risk is likely too low. Our study data predated the COVID-19 pandemic, although substantial shifts in disease prevalence seem unlikely. Finally, different risk factors and different levels of obesity carry different levels of risk for severe COVID-19 illness (e.g., a BMI of 45 kg/m2 or greater more than quintupled the risk for COVID-19-related death, whereas a BMI of 30 to 34 kg/m2 increased it by 26%) (5).

Our findings underscore the need for careful consideration of and preparation for school reopenings this fall. The resumption of face-to-face instruction is critical for children's development, health, and welfare. However, without adequate safeguards, reopening schools could put millions of vulnerable adults at risk for severe COVID-19 illness.

[2] Saliva vs deep nasal swabs vs anterior nasal swabs
Date: Fri 21 Aug 2020
Source: Science Daily [abridged, edited]

Self-collected saliva and deep nasal swabs collected by healthcare providers are equally effective for detecting SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to a new study conducted by ARUP Laboratories and University of Utah (U of U) Health.

The study, published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology [citation below], represents one of the largest prospective specimen type comparisons to date, said Julio Delgado, MD, MS, ARUP chief medical officer. Other studies, including one from the Yale School of Public Health, have reached similar conclusions but with markedly fewer patients and specimens.

Researchers also found that specimens self-collected from the front of the nose are less effective than deep nasal swabs for virus detection. This finding prompted a subsequent study that has not yet been published in which researchers learned they could improve the sensitivity of anterior nasal swab testing to 98% by combining an anterior nasal swab with a swab collected from the back of the throat.

The results have important implications for patients and providers. The collection process for saliva and anterior nasal specimens is less invasive than the deep nasal, or nasopharyngeal, swab. In addition, both specimen types can be self-collected, reducing the risk of exposure for healthcare workers who collect nasopharyngeal specimens, said Kimberly Hanson, MD, MPH, section chief of clinical microbiology at ARUP and the primary author of the study. "Saliva and nasal swab self-collection can resolve many of the resource and safety issues involved in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing," Delgado said.

ARUP and U of U Health anticipate being able to start offering testing on saliva in some U of U Health clinical settings in early September 2020. They already are using anterior nasal swabs in combination with throat swabs to test some asymptomatic individuals.

Hanson and her colleagues analyzed more than 1100 specimens from 368 volunteers at the U of U Health Redwood Health Center drive-through testing site from late May through June 2020. Volunteers self-collected saliva that they spit into a tube and swabbed from the front of both nostrils to produce specimens for testing. The researchers compared test results from these specimen types with test results from nasopharyngeal swabs healthcare providers collected from the volunteers. Discrepant results across specimens collected from the same patient triggered repeat testing using a 2nd polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based platform.

The study showed that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in at least 2 specimen types in 90% of the patients who tested positive for the virus. As a standalone alternative specimen to nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva proved to be an excellent option, Hanson said. Positivity rates for saliva specimens were nearly the same as those for nasopharyngeal specimens. The research showed that self-collected nasal swabs, when used alone, can miss nearly 15% of infections, which prompted researchers' further study combining them with oropharyngeal, or throat, swabs.

[As some of the newer rapid tests available are using home saliva collection, this comparative study of different specimen types used for testing of acute infection is valuable.

"Abstract: We prospectively compared healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) to self-collected anterior nasal swabs (ANS) and straight saliva for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in 354 patients. The positive percent agreement between NPS and ANS or saliva was 86.3% (95% CI: 76.7-92.9) and 93.8% (95% CI: 86.0-97.9), respectively. Negative percent agreement was 99.6% (95% CI: 98-100) for NPS vs ANS and 97.8% (95% CI: 95.3-99.2) for NPS vs saliva. NPS (n = 80) and saliva (n = 81) detected more cases than ANS (n = 70), but no single specimen type detected all SARS-CoV-2 infections."

The full article is available at https://jcm.asm.org/content/jcm/early/2020/08/07/JCM.01824-20.full.pdf.

The authors conclude: "This study represents one of the largest prospective specimen type comparisons to date and demonstrates excellent agreement between provider-collected NPS and patient self-collected saliva and ANS. The majority (91.9%) of patients with positive results had SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detected in at least 2 specimen types concurrently. NPS and saliva samples had the greatest positivity rates overall. Given that all participants had a strong clinical suspicion for COVID-19, and molecular testing in general has very high specificity, it is likely that the NPS or saliva positive only specimens are true positives, but the lack of an accepted external reference standard precludes calculations of clinical sensitivity and specificity. Even though there was excellent qualitative agreement across specimen types, relying on ANS alone could have missed infection in 10 to 11 patients compared with NPS or saliva, respectively. Missed COVID-19 cases have major clinical implications affecting isolation decisions for symptomatic patients and are a lost opportunity for contact tracing.

"No single sample type detected all potential COVID-19 cases, and discrepant results were not always explained by high Ct values (i.e., low RNA concentrations near the limit of detection of the test). There are several potential explanations for 'false-negative' results. First, inadequate swab collection technique is possible. We did not include a host genomic marker to ensure presence of respiratory epithelial cells on the swab, nor did we compare self-collection to healthcare provider-collected ANS. Previous respiratory virus studies, however, suggest that self-collected is equivalent to provider-collected ANS (11). We also did not evaluate the impact of swab type on SARS-CoV -2 detection. This study relied on foam nasal swabs and flocked NP swabs, so the results may not be generalizable to other swab types. Additionally, the level of viral replication in the nasopharynx or posterior oropharynx/salivary glands may vary over the course of infection. We did not collect information on the duration or type of symptoms at the time of specimen collection, which is an additional limitation of the study. Lastly, in an attempt to exclude RNA degradation in straight saliva as a potential explanation for 'false negatives', we performed stability studies at ambient and refrigerated temperatures for up to 5 days and saw no reduced TMA or PCR signal (data not shown).

"In conclusion, NPS and saliva were clinically superior to ANS alone for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic patients."

[These countries had been selected based on having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but different responses. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. One observation is that lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, as of today, 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug21_1598114778.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 51.0% of daily case numbers and 67.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 12.0 million cases. Brazil and the USA continue to dominate, followed by Colombia, Peru, Argentina, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 11.9% of daily case numbers and 5.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported greater than 3.9 million. Spain is the dominant country and is followed by Russia, France, Ukraine, Israel, Turkey, and Romania -- Germany did not report any newly confirmed cases today [21 Aug 2020].

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.7% of daily case numbers and 5.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.7 million cases. Iraq continues to dominate, followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Kuwait, and Lebanon.

- The African region reported 3.1% of daily case numbers and 4.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.98 million cases. South Africa continues to dominate followed by Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya, and Algeria.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.3% of daily case numbers and 1.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.43 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Viet Nam and New Zealand continue to report newly confirmed cases (14 and 11, respectively) following the new outbreaks identified in the past few weeks.

- The South East Asia region reported 27.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 16.5% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.3 million cases. India continues to be the driving force of the dominance of this region, followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia.

Impression: The overall picture is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 21 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (69 039), followed by the USA (50 455), and Brazil (31 391) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.3%). There were 5941 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (20-21 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by the USA, Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Russia, France, Philippines, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 4288 to 69 039. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Spain, South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Iran, Indonesia, Ukraine, Chile, Ethiopia, and Germany; their range of reported new cases is 1737 to 3650. A total of 28 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is very little change in the average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 2.0%), and looking at daily reported deaths, the change is increased by 2.3%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends. Time will tell, but following the data reports showing major surges in countries that had been showing successes makes one wonder what is driving these reporting variances (We haven't changed our minds! -- We feel like a broken record here...).

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions -- the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above), but if one looks at the percentage of positive PCR tests, in the past 3 weeks the positivity rate has been stable at 9%, consistent with significant ongoing transmission that is not abating (see https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/testing-in-us.html). The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
