WHEAT FACTS

Every few years CIMMYT produces a publication on World Wheat
Facts and Trends. CIMMYT (the International Center for Maize and
Wheat Improvement) is an internationally funded, non-profit
scientific research and training organization. Headquartered in
Mexico, CIMMYT is engaged in a research program for maize, wheat
and triticale, with emphasis on improving the productivity of
agricultural resources in developing countries. CIMMYT is one of
the international agricultural research centers supported by the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR).
The information in this posting is taken from:
CIMMYT. 1993. 1992/1993 CIMMYT World Wheat Facts and Trends.
Part 2, by Andrea Bohn. The World Wheat Situation: Current
Developments and Emerging Trends. pp. 26-28. CIMMYT, Mexico,
D.F.
CIMMYT. 1995. CIMMYT World Wheat Facts and Trends Supplement,
1995. Part 2, by Roderick M. Rejesus. The World Wheat
Situation. pp. 11-16. CIMMYT, Mexico, D.F.

Wheat Production
----------------
World wheat production in 1994 was estimated at 528 million
metric tons, a 6% decrease from the previous year's level of 564
million tons. This decrease primarily reflected the effects of
drought in North Africa and Australia and reduced production in
the former Soviet Union, where the political and economic
environment played a major role in reducing wheat production.
Production also fell in some major wheat-producing countries such
as Canada, China, Turkey and the United States. Farmers in
Canada and China shifted area from wheat into more profitable
crops, whereas those in Turkey suffered from dry weather. In
contrast, Argentina, the European Union and Eastern Europe
produced more wheat in 1994 than in 1993. World wheat production
is expected to rebound in the short term following more favorable
weather in Australia and Asia. The reduction of land set-aside
requirements and better wheat prices in the European Union are
also expected to provide the impetus for higher levels of wheat
production.
The rate of growth in world wheat production increased from 1955
to 1984 but decreased dramatically in the last decade. Average
annual growth in wheat production was 1.7% in 1955-64, rose to
3.4% in 1975-84, but then fell to 1.5% between 1985 and 1994,
well below the previous levels.

Consumption
------------
World wheat consumption was estimated at 555 million tons for
1992-93, 20 million tons below the peak recorded in 1990-91,
which came about because prices were extremely low. Wheat
consumption in developing countries has been growing at a rate of
4.8% over the last three decades (1961-90), compared to only 3.5%
for all cereals. Growth in demand worldwide will slow to around
2.1% from 1990 to 2005, but consumption of wheat in developing
countries will grow much faster (3.0% per year, headed by sub-
Saharan Africa at 3.3% per year) than in industrialized countries
(1.0% per year). As a result, developing countries will probably
consume three-fifths of the world's wheat by 2005, while their
share today is only half. Most of the growth in demand will come
from Asia.
By 2005, wheat will challenge rice as the major food staple in
developing countries because of a relatively higher increase in
demand (3.0% vs. 2.1%). Per capita rice consumption is projected
to be around 97 kg/year compared to 86 kg/year of wheat in 2005
(CIMMYT Economics Program database).
Demand for wheat has been growing faster than any other cereal.
Although growth in consumption is expected to decline eventually,
it is not certain to what extent developing countries will be
able to produce the wheat they need.
Trade
-----
The volume of wheat traded in 1993 was estimated at 114 million
tons (about 21% of the total wheat production). Despite their
expanding share of world wheat production, developing countries'
share of the world import market increased from 48% in 1961 to
59% in 1993.
Total wheat shipments from the five major exporters (Argentina,
Canada, the European Union, and the United States) represented
over 90% of the world exports in 1994. China and the countries
of the former Soviet Union remain the world's major wheat
importers.
World wheat stocks decreased from 150.1 million tons in 1993 to
139.2 million tons in 1994. Lower production led to reduced
inventories in order to meet world consumption requirements.
Most of the decline in stocks occurred among the five major
exporters and the former Soviet Union. In the near term, wheat
utilization is expected to exceed the anticipated higher
production levels, and the volume of exports is expected to
remain large, resulting in reductions in the world wheat stocks.
