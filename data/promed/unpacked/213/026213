The Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal) has led an analysis in which it has discovered that more than 50 000 people in Spain live with the parasitic Chagas disease [South American trypanosomiasis]. Of these, 613 are minors, the center supported by La Caixa Foundation said in a statement this Friday [25 Mar 2022].

The journal 'Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease' has published the results of the analysis on the infection caused by the parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_, which is endemic in 21 countries in Central and South America. The parasite is transmitted mainly by the bite of the vinchuca insect, the vector.

However, due to migratory flows, the disease has also become common in non-endemic areas, where it is transmitted mainly from mother to child -- congenital Chagas -- and, to a lesser extent, through blood transfusions and organ transplants.

Spain is the country with the highest burden of the disease outside the Americas "due to the high number of Latin American migrants", although researchers have noted that Chagas disease also exists in other European countries such as Italy and Switzerland.

In fact, they have warned that few countries have implemented "adequate" control measures in blood and organ banks, as well as in antenatal care services, despite the risk of disease transmission.

Regarding Spain, they estimate that 55 367 of the 2.6 million migrants from endemic countries live with the infection, of which 54% are people from Bolivia, where the prevalence of the disease is "very high."

In addition, from the almost 800 000 migrant women of reproductive age, 23 382 were affected in 2018, which leads researchers to think that the rate of underdiagnosed people in Spain is high, around 70%.

[This is the study referred to in the news report: Navarro, M et al. Estimating Chagas disease prevalence and number of underdiagnosed, and undertreated individuals in Spain. Travel Med Infect Dis. 2022 Mar 2;47:102284. doi: 10.1016/j.tmaid.2022.102284.

The problem is well recognized and is due to a high number of migrants from endemic areas in South America, as pointed out by the study. A recent review looked at the global occurrence of Chagas disease (Abras A et al. Worldwide control and management of Chagas disease in a new era of globalization: a close look at congenital _Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection. Clin Microbiol Rev. 2022 Mar 3:e0015221. doi: 10.1128/cmr.00152-21). - Mod.EP
