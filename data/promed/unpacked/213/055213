An _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak linked to a Belfast restaurant has been described as "major public health crisis" by Northern Ireland's [NI] Public Health Agency (PHA).

The PHA said there are now 20 confirmed cases and 150 suspected cases of food poisoning following an investigation at Flicks restaurant at Cityside Mall. 6 people have been hospitalized since the start of the outbreak, but most have since been discharged.

Dr Michael Devine from the PHA said it was NI's worst ever _E. coli_ outbreak. The doctor, who is the PHA's consultant in health protection, said: "The further increase in cases is not unexpected as the incubation period for _E. coli_ is typically up to 7 days. We expect therefore to see a further increase in cases as people continue to report symptoms and submit samples for testing." Dr Devine said that over the past decade, the number of people affected in previous _E. coli_ outbreaks in Northern Ireland had never exceeded 20.

A separate _E. coli_ outbreak in August 2012 affected 4 people who ate in the same restaurant on York Street. At the time, the PHA and Belfast City Council environmental health officers carried out an investigation and all tests on the restaurant were negative. The owner of Flicks, Michael McAdam, said there was "no definitive evidence" in August 2012 that the 4 people had contracted the poisoning at his restaurant.

[With a large cohort of ill individuals, it is should be possible to delineate a specific food vehicle or vehicles for the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_, unless the culprit is something that most people dining at the restaurant had eaten, such as salad. - Mod.LL
