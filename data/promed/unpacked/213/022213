Causal agent: peste des petits ruminants [PPR] virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks: 1
Summary of outbreaks, total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Gants tolgoi suuri, Mongon ayga, Darvi soum, Khovd [Hovd]
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Dec 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Total animals affected / Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Mongolian saiga: _Saiga tatarica mongolica_(Bovidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Mongolian saiga (_Saiga tatarica mongolica_) is an extremely rare species only present in the Altai-Sayan ecoregion, Mongolia.

All carcasses were disinfected and destroyed.

Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Control measures
Measures applied: screening; disinfection/disinfestation; quarantine; zoning; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: State Central Veterinary Laboratory (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Mongolian saiga / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 3 Jan 2017 2016 / positive

[The following information comes from a press release published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-Mongolia. The article is available at http://mongolia.panda.org/en/?289190/over-500-mongolian-saigas-have-died-due-to-disease-outbreak.

"[The] Mongolian saiga (_Saiga tatarica mongolica_) is one of the world's extremely rare species; [it is] only [found] in the Altai-Sayan ecoregion in Mongolia. Unfortunately, this endangered animal is [perishing] in large numbers because of disease outbreaks.

"Starting in December 2016, WWF-Mongolia received information about cases of saiga deaths. [A joint] investigation [involving] Khovd and Gobi-Altai provinces' Environmental Agency, Inspection Agency, and rangers [determined] that over 500 saigas died of infectious disease outbreaks. The numbers of dead saiga are increasing every day.

"A sample from a dead saiga was sent to the National Central Laboratory, and the results of the preliminary investigation showed that the disease is peste-des-petits ruminants.

"Last year [2016], the National Emergency Agency set up a quarantine because thousands of sheep and goats died due to this disease. All livestock were vaccinated, and the quarantine was canceled a month before [see ProMED posting 20160910.4477371].

"Experts confirmed that the location of the current disease outbreak is at the same place where the previous quarantine was declared. This evidence helped experts conclude that the saiga outbreak is from infected from livestock.

"WWF-Mongolia is cooperating with related agencies to identify hot-spots and exchange information through the Saiga rangers' network. We are also working to provide true, reliable information about this ruminant virus because of the risk of conflict between wildlife and humans as a result of saiga disease.

"Since 1998, WWF-Mongolia has been working on conservation of Mongolian saiga with local governments and communities funded by the MAVA Foundation. As a result of joint conservation efforts, the population has reached 14 600, and its range has expanded by 13 per cent as of 2015. Due to the dzud, a natural disaster during the winter of 2001/2002, the species' population has declined to 750 individuals." We are grateful to Dr Martin Gilbert, wildlife veterinarian, Cornell University, for bringing the above WWF report to our attention.

In 2016 Mongolia reported 11 outbreaks of peste des petits ruminants that affected sheep and goats. These outbreaks were all located in the province of Khovd. The event was reported to be resolved on 15 Nov 2016. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=20934.

In May 2015, another mass die-off of saiga antelopes in Kazakhstan was reported. Several laboratories identified the bacterium _Pasteurella multocida_ as the causative agent of haemorrhagic septicaemia, which led to the deaths of the animals. See ProMED-mail posting 20160420.4172382. - Mods.CRD/AS
