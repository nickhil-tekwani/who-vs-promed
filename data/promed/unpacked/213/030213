[To remind members, some 25 suspect human cases are involved in this
event and one hospitalized 13-year-old Wayuu Indian girl. I think
that we can assume that the numbers of flocks involved in the
previous 6 months in this general area will have been more than were
recorded in this incident. Also, the 2 previous reports had this
young girl sick from contact with goat meat. The above investigation
had the disease just in sheep. I suspect we are seeing different
sides of the epidemiologic elephant. - Mod.MHJ]
