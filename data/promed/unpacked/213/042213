About 90 percent of the 184 inmates at the Cass County Jail became ill
Sunday night and early Monday [27-28 Nov 2011], with a potential
foodborne illness, Sheriff Paul Laney said. Symptoms of the flu-like
illness included diarrhea, vomiting, and cramps, Laney said Monday,
[28 Nov 2011] at a news conference.

None of the inmates had to be taken to a hospital for treatment,
though nurses from Fargo Cass Public Health did treat those whose
symptoms were most severe, the jail's chief nurse Heidi McLean said.
Hydration was the main treatment, with inmates being urged to drink
Gatorade [sports drink made of water, carbohydrates, and electrolytes]
and water, she said.

Doug Jensen, a registered sanitarian with Fargo Cass Public Health,
said all aspects of food supply, storage, and preparation will be
examined to try to determine where the illness came from.

There were no reports of illnesses among staff, Laney said.

No inmates missed court appearances due to the wave of illness, jail
staff said. And some had already felt well enough to eat lunch on 28
Nov 2011, Laney said.

Inmates were served a casserole with ground turkey, chili, and
macaroni; corn; cornbread; whipped butter; cookies; and a powdered
drink for supper Sun 27 Nov 2011, Laney said.

[The etiology of the cluster is unclear but with a seemingly short
incubation period, no mention of fever and prompt resolution with no
secondary spread to guards, the diagnosis of staphylococcal food
poisoning due to a preformed enterotoxin needs strong consideration. -
