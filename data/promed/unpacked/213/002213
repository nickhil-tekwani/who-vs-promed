Tension remains high in Mombasa's Changamwe area following fears of an outbreak of a mosquito-borne virus known as o'nyong'nyong characterized by high fever, severe joint pains, and rashes, symptoms similar to chikungunya virus [infection].

This, even as health services continue to be partially affected in 13 counties where nurses are said to be on a go slow following failure by the county governments to honour the terms of the return to work formula that saw the nurses end their 5 month strike.

[O'nyong'nyong virus (ONNV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus of the Togaviridae family. The virus was first isolated in June 1959 from serum samples from febrile patients in the northern province of Uganda. ONNV is primarily transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. ONNV is genetically and serologically related to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) but is restricted to the African continent. The clinical picture resembles CHIKV infection, that is, a self-limited febrile illness characterized by headache, rash, and joint pain. In contrast to CHIKV, ONNV is reported to cause lymphadenopathy more often, and affected joints do not show effusions.

ONNV caused 2 large-scale epidemics in East Africa during 1959-1962 and in 1996. The 1st instance had spread from Uganda south to Mozambique and westward to Senegal. Comprising over 2 million cases in east Africa alone, this 1st epidemic ranked among the largest mosquito-borne virus outbreaks recorded. After an absence of reported cases for 35 years, a 2nd ONNV epidemic occurred in Uganda. Patients had fever, a maculopapular rash, pruritis [itchy skin], myalgia, and arthralgia of large joints. Lymphadenitis, most often of the posterior cervical spine region, was also observed. Despite the virus' potential to cause large outbreaks and its endemicity in the vast geographic area of East Africa, and at least sporadic occurrence in West Africa, imported cases to other areas have not been reported (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/10/14-0823_article).

However, the present report is not confirmatory of an outbreak of o'nyong-nyong virus; it is still suspected.

We would be very grateful if any knowledgeable sources could volunteer information on this outbreak, including the actual diagnosis, how many people have been infected so far, any mortalities, age group, and gender. - Mod.YA

The brief report above is confusing. The headline says, "after the outbreak", which implies that there has been an outbreak, and ONNV is the suggested etiology. As Mod.YA stated above, the case numbers, dates of infection, and laboratory results are not given. O'nyong'nyong virus infections were suspected in Kenya in 1997 and again in 2004. Chikungunya virus infections have occurred there in 2016. - Mod.TY
