Suspected dropsy kills boy, 40 hospitalized
-----------------------------------------------
An 8-year-old boy died Sunday [6 Feb 2005], while 40 people were
hospitalized [in Lucknow], apparently after consuming food cooked in
adulterated mustard oil, reports said.
Medical officers here suspect it to be a dropsy epidemic -- caused by the
consumption of mustard oil adulterated with toxic prickly poppy -- in which
patients experience swelling in the body. However, doctors here have not
yet confirmed them as dropsy cases. They said they would wait for the blood
test results.
The victims, admitted to different hospitals, complained of swollen limbs,
vomiting and breathing problems, after consuming food cooked in mustard
oil. They said many of them had been feeling uneasy since the 1st week of
January [2005].
A dropsy epidemic was reported in Delhi in 1998. As many as 41 people were
killed.

[A previous ProMED-mail posting, 20030702.1632 provides a review of the
literature involving dropsy.
Sanguinarine is an benzophenanthridine alkaloid obtained from sanguinaria
(_Sanguinaria canadensis_) and other species of the same family, including
_Argemone mexicana_ (the common name is Mexican Poppy). The seeds of the
plant are pressed and processed for oil, a process which may concentrate
the alkaloids present. The seeds are most likely the most toxic portion of
this plant.
Members of _Sanguinaria_ spp. have been known to be used medicinally to
treat gingivitis, halitosis, and cough. However, prolonged use or overdose
has been demonstrated to cause stomach pain, diarrhea, visual changes,
paralysis, fainting, and collapse.
The plant is unsafe for use in children and should not be used by pregnant
or lactating women. - Mod.TG]
