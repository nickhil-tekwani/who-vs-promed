The Wyoming Game and Fish Department says chronic wasting disease has
turned up in 2 northern Wyoming hunt areas for the 1st time.

The department lab in Laramie confirmed this week that a bull elk
killed 21 Oct 2009 in hunt area 35, southwest of Buffalo, tested
positive for the neurological disease.

Also, the department says a mule deer buck killed 15 Oct 2009 in the
Spring Creek drainage southeast of 10 Sleep also tested positive.

The disease has now been detected in 9 hunting areas in the Big Horn Basin.

Chronic wasting disease can affect moose, deer and elk.

There's no evidence the disease is transferred to humans, but the
department recommends against eating animals that look sick or test
positive for the disease.

[Chronic wasting disease has been in Wyoming for decades, but it seems
like this may be a slight expansion of the disease within the state.

Readers are encouraged to see ProMED-mail post 20091015.3548 for more
information on the disease itself.
