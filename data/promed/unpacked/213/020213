PIG TRANSPLANTS
There are now thousands of people walking around with pig heart valves. I
have never heard of any "mad cow disease" or other veterinary malady
related to pig valves. Suggest the author of this note to ProMED-mail do a
Medline of pig valves and check with commercial manufacturers as well. It
might be interesting to do long term follow ups on some of these patients.
I have a friend who has an aortic one that has been working without fail
for at least 15 years. He is well.

Bioprosthetic valves have been transplanted from pigs into human hearts for
many years. I don't recall that there has been any outbreak of unusual
viral diseases among human recipients of pig valves. I don't know the
statistics, but presumably one can put an upper bound on the risk of such
an infection by looking into this. Has such a calculation been done?

[Not that I have read up on the subject, but I believe that these
replacement porcine heart valves were/are recovered from commercially
reared pigs at slaughter. Maybe someone can enlighten me on that specific
point. - Mod.MHJ

A organ transplanted from a pig to a human could theoretically be affected
by a swine pathogen if the organism is able to access the organ. For the
pathogen to access the organ, it must be able to invade the new host. I
would suspect that specific receptors are necessary for a virus to invade
the host. If a human does not possess these receptors in the respiratory or
gastrointestinal tracts, it is unlikely that the swine virus could reach
and affect a transplanted swine liver.
In any case, I would not recommend a swine xenograft patient to continue a
job as a hog farmer.

My concern with xenotransplantation in terms of medical risks are the
possibility of prion transmission. I believe most of the obvious risks
would be covered, but prion diseases could pose an unevaluated risk. It is
my understanding that in swine it takes 8 years or more for BSE type
illness to be evident, long after they would be killed for transplantation
(or food).
>From incidents with CJD organ donors we know it can be transmitted via
organ transplantation in humans. I am concerned many patients could die
from iatrogenic CJD type illness before this risk is recognized and addressed.

[To date a natural TSE of swine has yet to be identified, though logic
would suggest that all species have them. The only cases I know of were
from experimental intracranial exposures. Added to which commercial pigs do
not live long enough to show the disease. Most pigs are killed between 6 &
9 months and it is the very exceptional sow that goes over three years. One
would expect donor pigs to follow a similar harvesting pattern. The porcine
prion risk would thus appear to be slight, and if special donor colonies
are being used, as near zero as one can get. - Mod.MHJ
