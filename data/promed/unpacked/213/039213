Calgary health officials broaden E. coli probe
----------------------------------------------
Health officials in Calgary are asking diners at 3 restaurants to come
forward, in the latest attempt to find the source of an _E. coli_ O157
outbreak that has affected dozens of people in the city.
Earlier in Sep 2004, Calgary Health Region officials started seeing a
cluster of _E. coli_ cases. By Tue, 28 Sep 2004 the number of people
affected had climbed to 47. 3 people remain in hospital, 1 in serious
condition.
Health officials now say 2/3 of the people with _E. coli_ infection ate at
3 restaurants between 1 and 17 Sep 2004:
My Donair - 4310 MacLeod Trail southwest
My Donair - 1200-37th St. southwest
Wendy's - 475-36th St. northeast
Dr. Judy MacDonald, the health region's deputy medical officer of health,
wants to hear from all diners at those restaurants, including those who
don't have symptoms.
"It's called a case control study; and then we can hopefully use that
information to zero in more on the more likely source of the food problem,"
she said.
Health officials are looking at ground beef as a possible source of the
outbreak. But the restaurants have different meat suppliers, so officials
are considering other foods.
"We know from other outbreaks that have been reported in North America that
lettuce has been watered with water that may have been contaminated with
_E. coli_, and that has been a source of _E. coli_ outbreaks in the past,"
said MacDonald.
"We want to make sure we're not jumping to conclusions here, and we're
trying to consider all the possibilities."
There were 40 cases in the area during 2003.
