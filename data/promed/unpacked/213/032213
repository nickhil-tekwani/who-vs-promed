The Caretaker North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) Health Minister
Syed Kamal Shah expressed his dismay over the "continuous reluctance"
of the National Institute of Health (NIH) in providing the provincial
government with reports regarding the bird flu victims. Setting a
24-hour deadline to the NIH for releasing the report, he said that
the institute's denial or delay would be taken as they were hiding
the report for vested interests. Besides, Syed Kamal said that the
NWFP government was seriously considering closing down the poultry
business in the Frontier province. The Minister said 70 percent of
Pakistan's poultry industry was based in the 2 districts of the NWFP,
including Abbottabad and Mansehra, which he felt had been posing
serious threat to the lives of the local population.

It may be recalled that after the deaths of 2 brothers at the Khyber
Teaching Hospital (KTH) in Peshawar on 19 and 29 Oct [2007]
respectively, 3 more patients suffering from bird flu virus were
admitted to hospitals in Abbottabad and Peshawar.

In Ayub Medical Complex (AMC), Abbottabad, where 2 patients, [a 38
year old man] and a 10 year old girl, were admitted, doctors said
their condition was stable and they were sent home. Medical
Superintendent AMC Dr Iftikhar, when reached on telephone, told 'The
News' one of them was working at a poultry farm in Abbottabad while
the girl was living in the vicinity of the farm. "Their blood samples
had been sent to the NIH but the report is awaited," he said. Another
patient, who belongs to the nearby Palosai town, was admitted to the
KTH.

Dr Mukhtiar Zaman Afridi, who is a noted chest physician and in
charge of Pulmonology ward of the hospital, when contacted on
telephone said the patient was in a stable condition and his blood
samples had been sent to the NIH. Also, he said the report was
expected to be made available to them today [Mon 17 Dec 2007]). He
said the patient had been kept in an isolation room and was under his
personal observation. However, during a visit to the hospital (KTH)
on Sunday [16 Dec 2007], a number of doctors and health workers
complained to this correspondent that there was a mechanism to keep
them safe from the virus but the ventilator of the isolation room
where the patient had been kept was open and the virus could spread
around in the entire hospital through air. Also, this scribe found Dr
Mukhtiar Zaman Afridi was removing fears from the mind of his staff
created after the death of 2 brothers under their observation. The
majority of doctors, paramedics, and nurses were reluctant to go into
the isolation room to attend the patient.

However, Dr Mukhtiar's lecture persuaded his staff to continue
attending this altogether different patient. Despite being a public
holiday, Dr Mukhtiar was seen present in the hospital from early
morning to the evening where he regularly examined the patient.

It was dismal to note that the 2 isolation rooms where the 2 brothers
were kept and later died were found locked by the hospital
administration. Also, despite the passage of 2 weeks, the KTH
administration has failed to ensure sterilisation of equipment used
in attending the 2 brothers.

[This report provides some dates and expresses local frustration at
the tardiness of the National Institute of Health of Pakistan in
communicating the results of diagnostic tests.

Two other suspected H5N1 cases have been admitted to hospital in
Abbottabad, one a poultry worker and the other a young girl living
near a farm. These cases further strengthen the link between human
infection and poultry and reduce the probability in this outbreak of
transmission of the virus by human-to-human transmission.
