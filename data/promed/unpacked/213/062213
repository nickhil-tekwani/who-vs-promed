A resurgence of measles in Victoria has prompted health authorities
to warn the public to ensure they are vaccinated against the highly
infectious disease. There have been 15 cases of measles reported in
the 1st 6 weeks of the year [2011]. More than half of these cases have
caught the disease overseas.

Victoria's Chief Health Officer Dr John Carnie said 8 people were
diagnosed with the disease when they returned to Australia. "Most of
the additional 7 cases are people who may have had contact with the
returned travellers," Dr Carnie said.

There are fears more people have been infected. 6 people, aged
between 8 months and 66 years, had to be hospitalised after
contracting measles. The symptoms are similar to a cold and include a
rash which begins after 3-7 days and spreads from the face to the rest
of the body. Anyone who develops these symptoms, or has been in
contact with a person with measles, is being advised to ring their GP
[general practitioner] or hospital before they attend to ensure the
disease is not spread to other patients.

Measles is a highly infectious viral disease that can cause serious
illness, particularly in very young children and adults. "People can
develop pneumonia and other serious complications from the disease,"
Dr Carnie said. Children should be vaccinated at 12 months and
[boosted at] 4 years.

[Victoria joins the list of Australian states that are experiencing
or recently have experienced outbreaks of measles imported from
abroad. These outbreaks reveal that the uptake of the MMR triple
vaccine in childhood in Australia is less than complete. In the
interim, Australians travelling to countries where measles is
prevalent should ensure that they have been vaccinated to protect both
themselves and others on their return to Australia.
