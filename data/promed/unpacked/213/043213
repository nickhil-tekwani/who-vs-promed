From: Stephen Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

GIDEON notes that 14 outbreaks were reported in the territory of the
current Russian Republic during 1950 to 1974. An outbreak of 23 cases was
documented in Lipetsk (at a psychiatric facility near Moscow) in 1997 - the
index patient was thought to have had Brill-Zinsser disease.

[Brill-Zinsser disease is recrudescent typhus. The recrudescent disease is
generally milder and of shorter duration than primary typhus, but can serve
as a source of organisms for transmission by lice. - Mod.ES
