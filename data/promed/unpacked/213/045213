Indonesia: 46th Bird Flu Death Confirmed
-----------------------------------------------
A 35-year-old woman was Indonesia's 46th bird flu death, health
authorities said today [20 Aug 2006] as they stepped up an urgent
probe into whether she may belong to a [suspected] cluster of cases.
The woman came from Cikelet, a group of villages in West Java's Garut
district, where 2 other people -- one of whom remains alive -- have
been confirmed as being infected with H5N1. At least 16 others are
being tested.
"Tests by the Health Ministry's research and development laboratory
and by NAMRU (the US Naval Medical Research Unit) both showed that
patient was positively infected with bird flu [virus]," said senior
health ministry official I Nyoman Kandun. Positive results from these
2 laboratories mean that the WHO considers the death to be caused by
[avian influenza virus infection]. Kandun was referring to a patient
who died last Thursday [17 Aug 2006] after a few hours of treatment.
Three other people from Cikelet have also died recently while
exhibiting possible bird flu symptoms but were not tested for the
virus, heightening concern that limited human-to-human transmission
may have occurred in the area. Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari
told ElShinta radio that one of the 3 people who died of possible
bird flu was the child of the latest victim, the 35-year-old female patient.
The minister said samples from a further 16 people in the area had
been taken for testing. Of 3 suspected bird flu cases earlier
hospitalized in the provincial capital of Bandung, 2 have [tested
negative], but test results for the 3rd were not yet available, she said.
Experts from the Health Ministry and WHO [personnel] were dispatched
to Cikelet last Thursday [17 Aug 2006] to investigate the escalating
number of cases in the area, which is difficult to reach by road and
where sick poultry have recently been found.
Supari also said that more than 100 chickens had died in Cikelet
recently, and tests showed the presence of H5N1 in some of them.
ElShinta [radio] reported that the local district chief had declared
all chickens in Cikelet should be culled and the keeping of chickens
banned until 2007. Local authorities could not be immediately
contacted for comment.

[2] Indonesia - 46th Avian Influenza Death

Indonesia: Possible New Cluster Cases Being Probed
-----------------------------------------------
A 35-year-old woman who died last week in an Indonesian village
described as rife with [avian influenza] was infected with the virus,
according to 2 local tests, and a possible new cluster case is being
probed, the health minister said on Sunday [20 Aug 2006]. The woman
from the West Java village of Cikelet -- which has seen a series of
confirmed and suspected cases of bird flu in humans -- died on Thu 17
Aug 2006 after being treated for symptoms of the H5N1 virus. "[She]
was positive; we suspect there is a possibility of [a] cluster,"
Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari told Reuters by telephone.
Another official said the dead woman's 9-year-old daughter died a
week before her mother after showing signs of bird flu, although no
specimens were taken for testing. "Her 9-year-old daughter died a
week before her, but we did not take her specimens, so we don't know
whether she is positive or negative," I Nyoman Kandun, Indonesia's
Director General of Communicable Disease Control, said by telephone.
"It seems she had the same symptoms: pneumonia, breathlessness. If
the daughter was also positive, we can say this is cluster family
[i.e. a family cluster]."
The latest death takes Indonesia's toll from the disease to 46, the
highest of any country. The official said that they were collecting
samples from others who may have been in contact with the family from
the hamlet of Pasir Gambir. "From the government's view based on our
initial tests, the virus has only been caught from fowl so far. But
we are doing surveillance now," the minister said.
Fears that the virus had mutated into a form that could pass easily
between humans heightened in May 2006 when 7 people from an extended
family died of the disease in Indonesia's North Sumatra. Scientists
worry that the H5N1 virus that has killed around 140 people and
millions of birds since 2003 as it spread from Asia to Europe and
Africa could mutate into a strain that could spark a human pandemic.
The latest death in Indonesia is the 2nd confirmed from bird flu in
the area, made up of a number of remote hamlets about 90 km (55
miles) south of the provincial capital of West Java, Bandung. A
9-year-old girl from Cikelet, which is in the Garut region, died of
bird flu last week according to local tests. A 17-year-old youth from
the village had also tested positive to the H5N1 virus, but he has
stayed at home after refusing to be hospitalized. More than 10 [now
at least 16] people from the area were also being tested for the
virus, officials said.
Indonesia has seen a steady increase in human bird flu deaths this
year [2006], and the virus is endemic in poultry in nearly all of the
provinces of the sprawling archipelago. The country, which has been
criticized for not doing enough to stamp out H5N1, has shied away
from mass culling of poultry so far, citing the expense and the
logistical difficulties because of the millions of backyard fowl.

[The number of cases under surveillance in the complex of hamlets in
West Java known as the village of Cikelet has increased to at least
16, and a 2nd fatal case of avian influenza virus infection has been
confirmed, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 3. The reason
for this cluster of cases has yet to be established, and the
possibilities remain of infection from a common source (the abundance
of infected poultry in the village), of susceptibility of members of
an extended family (one suspected fatal case is the daughter of a
confirmed case, also a fatal case), or of an increase in virulence of
the virus. The latter is still the least likely explanation, since
changes in virulence for humans have not been observed anywhere up to
the present.

[3] Viet Nam - 2 Suspected Cases Test negative

Viet Nam: Deceased patient in Hau Giang tested negative for H5N1 virus
-----------------------------------------------
A patient from the Mekong delta province of Hau Giang, who was
hospitalized on 3 Aug 2006 and died on 6 Aug 2006 at the Ho Chi Minh
City Tropical Hospital, was not infected with H5N1 avian influenza
virus, the Public Heath Ministry officially reported on Fri 18 Aug
2006. This has been the 2nd suspected H5N1 infection case in Kien
Giang and Hau Giang southern provinces since early this month [August
2006], but both cases have tested negative to the H5N1 virus.
However, experts continue to warn the people to watch out for any
possible outbreak of bird flu in humans. Local health authorities
have taken the added precaution of disinfecting the houses of the 2
suspected patients in the 2 provinces.
Viet Nam now has 2 international standard labs capable of effectively
dealing with an epidemic. The Public Health Ministry has promoted
quarantine checks at border gates, especially the examination of
passengers from H5N1-flu-infected areas, but no suspected cases have
been reported. The ministry has also prepared enough medicine,
medical equipment, chemicals and others equipment to face any
outbreak of the epidemic.
No new human cases of H5N1 have been reported in Viet Nam for 10 months now.
