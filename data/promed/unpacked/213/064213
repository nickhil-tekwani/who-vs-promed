Thousands of Dead Fish on Florida Beach
-------------------------
Tens of thousands of dead fish washed up on about 2 miles of beach,
creating a smelly headache for Volusia County officials Tuesday.
The rotting croakers, snappers, and other fish, most about 6 inches
long, washed up on New Smyrna Beach, about 15 miles south of
Daytona Beach, beginning Monday afternoon, said Capt. Tony
Sopotnick of the Beach Patrol.
"I have been walking this beach for 20 years,'' said resident Herb
Rasmussen, 86. "This is the first time I have ever seen this. This is a big
kill.'' State wildlife and health officials were trying to determine the
cause.

[The reason this is listed as a die-off is because there is not a good
guess as to the etiology; botulism, other toxins, viral
septicemia,whirling disease, bacterial infections. There is not enough
information here to form an educated hypothesis. - Mod.TG]
