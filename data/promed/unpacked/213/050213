Public health officials in OutbreakNet (the network of
epidemiologists and other public health officials, facilitated by
CDC, who investigate outbreaks of foodborne, waterborne, and other
enteric illnesses nationwide) are investigating a multistate outbreak
of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Wandsworth infections.
Interviews comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons show that
consumption of Robert's American Gourmet brand Veggie Booty was
statistically associated with illness and therefore the most likely
source of the outbreak.
As of 3 Jul 2007 at 11 AM EDT, 57 persons infected with serotype
Wandsworth have been reported to CDC from 18 states: California,
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Among the patients for whom clinical information is available, 76
percent developed bloody diarrhea and 10 percent were hospitalized.
No deaths have been attributed to this infection. Onset dates, which
are known for 49 patients, ranged from 4 Mar to 15 Jun 2007. The
number of cases has gradually increased, with only 8 cases reported
from 6 states before 1 May 2007. Health department and CDC
investigators worked for weeks conducting interviews with parents of
ill children to develop theories about possible sources of infection.
A multistate case-control study demonstrated a strong association
between illness and consumption of Veggie Booty, a snack of puffed
rice and corn with a vegetable coating. CDC OutbreakNet staff shared
this information with colleagues at the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) on 27 Jun 2007. After being informed about the outbreak by FDA,
the company that manufactures the product issued a voluntary recall
on the following day. Persons are advised to discard any product in
their possession.
OutbreakNet officials at CDC and in state and local health
departments, FDA, and the marketing and manufacturing companies are
working collaboratively to learn more about production of Veggie
Booty to determine how it may have become contaminated.
The Minnesota Department of Agriculture Laboratory has isolated the
outbreak strain of _S._ Wandsworth from a sealed bag of Veggie Booty
obtained from a store. Cultures of 4 other sealed bags of Veggie
Booty by this laboratory have also yielded _Salmonella_;
determination of whether these isolates are the outbreak strain is in
progress.
On 2 Jul 2007, the company expanded the recall to include Super
Veggie Tings Crunchy Corn Sticks. This was done due to the company's
concern that Veggie Booty and Super Veggie Tings share ingredients
that could be contaminated. Persons should discard any Veggie Tings
in their possession. CDC is not aware of any human illnesses
associated with the consumption of Super Veggie Tings Crunchy Corn
Sticks.

[The recall has involved both the USA and Canada and, as stated, now
involves a 2nd product. This posting confirms the finding of a
"smoking" bag.
