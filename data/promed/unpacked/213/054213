An outbreak of bovine rabies was detected in 4 districts in the Cordillera department, according to information provided by Ada Ramirez, Regional Chief of PAI (Programa Ampliado de Inmunizacion [Expanded Immunization Program]).

It is thought that transmission of the disease [virus] occurred through bats, which are one of the carriers of the disease.

In total, the report was of 4 cases, one in each of the districts of Nueva Colombia, Emboscada, Arroyos y Esteros, and Caacupe.

Ramirez recalled that last year [2012], 2 cases of bovine rabies were registered, one in Juan de Mena and the other in Arroyos y Esteros [districts]. "In confronting this outbreak, case follow up was carried out immediately, and it was found that a total of 11 people attended these animals, attempting to provide help thinking that the continuous slobber coming from their mouths was a consequence of choking or some lesion in their throats. The owners of the cattle, wanting to help their animals, put their hands in the animal's mouths trying to provide relief to the animals." Due to this contact, these people had to receive doses of rabies vaccine.

[It is not unusual for owners attempting to help rabid cattle (and other animals) to believe that choking and excessive salivation are due to a foreign object caught in the mouths or throats of the affected animals, with their resulting exposure to the virus. Bovine rabies (bovine paralytic rabies) is common in tropical Latin America, corresponding to the geographic range of the common vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_. It is prudent for livestock owners in these areas to routinely vaccinate all their animals. The death of one or more animals exceeds the cost of vaccination of the herd, and reduces the risk to individuals attending infected animals.
