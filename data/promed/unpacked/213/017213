Area farm wages expanding war on potato worm
-----------------------------------------------
Larry and Joe Guilian have built their lives around this plot of rich
Livingston County soil. As boys, they rushed home after school
everyday to work on the family potato farm in the hamlet of South
Lima.
But as men, they're facing a challenge their father and grandfather
never imagined. The Guilian land is infested with an invasive
species, a rare strain of root-eating microscopic worm known to exist
on just one other farm in the entire United States.
The combined efforts of 3 generations are at stake, as the Guilian
brothers are forced each year to dump thousands of pounds of rotting
potatoes that they were unable to sell.
Nematodes are typically introduced as hard brown cysts in the soil.
Once their target prey -- plants such as potatoes, tomatoes and
eggplants -- begin to grow, the eggs within these cysts sense a
chemical signal indicating that roots are developing. They hatch and
start feeding on these roots.
Infested plants rarely die, but they are of little use to farmers,
said Bill Brodie, a retired Cornell University professor who
researched the pest for years.
Sated, the female nematodes burrow into the roots. Once they're
fertilized by the free-crawling males, they swell into amber-colored
spheres the size of a pinhead, each filled with eggs. Undisturbed,
the process repeats itself over and over again until the soil is
teeming with millions of nematodes.
But even if the land is planted with an unsuitable food source, it
will remain infested. A nematode cyst can survive for decades in the
soil, waiting for the right crop before releasing its 300 or more
eggs.
For decades, the story of the golden nematode was heralded as a great
success story of invasive species control. The original strain of the
pest likely hitched a ride from Europe to Long Island on Army
vehicles returning home from World War I.
Problems were discovered on Long Island in 1941, then in western New
York -- including the Guilian farm -- by the late 1960s and early
1970s.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture jumped into action, paying farmers
as much as USD 150 per acre not to grow potatoes.
Pesticides were applied and, when injected into the soil, were very
effective. However, after the chemicals were found in groundwater on
Long Island, the practice was discontinued.
Soon, a better strategy emerged. Cornell University in Ithaca,
Tompkins County, began working in the 1960s to develop new potato
varieties by crossing commercial crops with a wild Peruvian potato
naturally resistant to the nematode. They succeeded, and for decades
farmers have been required by federal law to grow only these 30 or so
resistant varieties on infested land.
Even a small amount of soil can spread the pest, so farmers in
quarantined areas were also required to steam-treat their equipment
with superheated water between fields and to submit to annual soil
tests by state agriculture officials.
The system worked, restricting the nematode infestation to about 17
000 acres in 9 New York counties: Orleans, Genesee, Livingston,
Steuben, Seneca, Wayne, Cayuga, Nassau and Suffolk. To date, the
golden nematode has not been found in any other state, and control
efforts are ongoing.
Jessica Chittenden, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Agriculture and Markets, which enforces the quarantine, cited a new
plan to create best management practices for nematode control, and
even management plans that are personalized for each farm, to ensure
that the pest does not spread.
Despite these precautions, a new nematode strain known as R02 [= Ro2]
managed to jump from a single site on Long Island to Livonia then
march across the Guilian land. "Half our farm is infested," Larry
Guilian said.
Brodie theorized that both strains were introduced at the same time,
but the R02 worms couldn't compete against the original strain. Now,
with original nematode populations depressed by years of control
measures, the R02 can make its move. So R02 could emerge anywhere
infested with golden nematode, he said.
The Guilians tried to use the same strategies that had worked against
the original strain. A handful of varieties that are resistant to R02
exist, and the brothers have grown them all. A yellow potato called
the Sante showed the most promise but ultimately has been a failure.
In the past 4 years, the brothers have dumped 642 000 pounds of
potatoes, the bulk of a crop that they raised and harvested but
couldn't sell.
Compared to the varieties the Guilians used to grow, Santes were
smaller and bruised more easily.
When the R02 strain was discovered 5 years ago, the brothers hoped
they could wait out a few bad years while Cornell researchers bred a
better potato.
Chittenden verified that a "commercially acceptable" resistant potato
is 5 to 10 years away. But as the years pass and research funds
shrink, the Guilians are losing hope. The farm has already lost more
than USD 160 000.
Despite their precautions, R02 on the Guilian farm has spread from 20
acres in 2000 to at least 60 of the 120 or so acres they plant with
potatoes each year.
New York grows about 20 000 acres of potatoes each year, a crop worth
USD 42.7 million, according to USDA data from 2004. None of those
farms wants to see the infestation spread.
Canadian officials also have been very clear that any indication that
New York is losing control over its nematode infestation could result
in a complete border closure for any crops that are sold with soil on
them, soybeans, potatoes, flower bulbs and nursery plants, Wickham
said.
That safety can't be assured without more of a federal commitment to
controlling this invasive species, said Wickham, who has spent the
past few months lobbying for funding.
Karl Hoffman, who grows about 200 acres of potatoes in Springville,
Erie County, said the quarantine is working. Thus far, his area --
about 70 miles west of the Guilian farm -- is free of both strains of
golden nematode. But he wants to see funds dedicated to maintaining
vigilance and developing new resistant varieties so that the region's
farms will have options no matter what happens.
"You don't want (golden nematode) anywhere near you," Hoffman said.
"It's a scary thing. ... It could wipe out life as we know it."
Last year [2005], the USDA's pest control division, known as the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, was granted USD 808 000.
But Wickham said that USD 1.268 million is needed for the program to
ensure that some funding is directed toward nematode control in New
York.

[2] Soybean cyst nematode - Illinois: new strains

Soybean cyst nematode: A USD 250 million problem that won't go away
-----------------------------------------------
Soybean planting in Illinois is just weeks away, and while farmers
worry about the possibility of plant-killing rust, some crop
researchers are sounding a different alarm: Beware the soybean cyst
nematode.
The tiny parasite is found in 84 percent of the state's soybean
fields, according to a survey completed last year [2005], and has
evolved into a pest that can rob yield even from soybean varieties
thought to be nematode resistant.
"We have plenty of farmers getting 50 or 60 bushels (per acre) who
should be getting 70 and 80 bushels," says Terry Niblack, a plant
pathologist at the University of Illinois who studies soybean cyst
nematode nearly full-time.
Nematodes are tiny roundworms, only about 1/64th of an inch long,
that suck nutrients from a plant's roots, decreasing its ability to
produce beans. And their thievery is invisible; infected plants don't
look sick, and unless farmers spend time sampling their soil, they
might never know how much they're losing.
"It's a war, not just a battle," says Steve Stierwalt, who grows
about 600 acres of soybeans on his farm near Sadorus, in Champaign
County.
Yield losses statewide could reach as high as USD 250 million per
year, Niblack said. That represents about 10 percent of the total
value of Illinois' soybean production in 2004.
Researchers have spent years looking for the best way to control the
soybean cyst nematode. In Illinois alone, the state Soybean Checkoff
Board provides about USD 250 000 per year to study the pest, said
Mary Burke, the board's research director.
But rather than a cure, Niblack and other researchers are finding
surprises. The nematodes have remarkable ability to adjust to human
intervention.
Soybean cyst nematode was 1st reported in Japan about 90 years ago
but likely existed in Asia long before that. Scientists believe the
pest was likely introduced in the United States in the late 1800s,
even though it wasn't discovered until 1954.
"The nematode has adapted very well to the Midwest," Niblack said.
Over the years, breeders developed soybean varieties that resist the
effects of nematodes and keep yield losses under control, said Greg
Tylka, a plant pathologist at Iowa State University. Some breeders
also have boasted of a cure for the pest, but none has proven
effective because of the nematode's adaptability.
And resistant varieties are becoming susceptible. A 1990 survey found
about 60 percent of the nematodes found in Illinois were not able to
attack any resistant variety of soybean, but last year's [2005]
survey found the opposite, Niblack said.
"We've been using resistant varieties now for 15 years across a
majority of fields in the state, and now most of our nematodes are
able to attack those resistant varieties," she said.
The 2005 survey found an average population in Illinois of 2700 eggs
per 100 cubic centimeters of soil, about 5 times the threshold
considered harmful, Niblack said.
Many farmers "do have the belief that if they just grow a variety
labeled resistant for soybean cyst nematode, that's all they need to
do, and that's not enough," she said. "They also need to sample the
soil and pay attention to whether the numbers are going up or down,
and they also need to find out how good the resistance is in the
varieties they're planting."
Farmers can scout for soybean cyst nematode by taking random samples
from a 10-acre section of field, mixing them together and sealing
some of the soil in a plastic bag to send to a private or
university-sponsored soil-testing laboratory, Niblack said.
It also isn't enough to simply rotate corn and soybeans each year in
a field, she said. Farmers also need to change the soybean variety
they plant "to show the nematode something different each time."
Such rotations have worked for Stierwalt, the Sadorus-area farmer,
but he still hopes a way will be found to defeat the nematode.
"We have battles every year, and at this point we're hoping that
there'll be something, possibly through the genetic route, that will
actually give us something to win the war," he said.
Soybean farmers have spent the past couple years learning all they
can about Asian soybean rust, the devastating disease that arrived in
the United States in 2004. Many have plans to spend thousands of
dollars on fungicides should rust get anywhere near their fields.
"All that money will be lost if they have soybean cyst nematode in
their soil and don't manage it properly," Tylka said. "Certainly we
want to be on our toes and prepared for the newest, most threatening
pest, but let's not forget the fox that's already in the hen house."

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is susceptible to the
potato cyst nematode (_Globodera rostochiensis_, PCN), which is also
known as the golden nematode (GN) especially in N. America. It is
found in many places where potatoes are grown including Europe (see
link for worldwide distribution map). There are 2 species of PCN
affecting crops in Europe. The white or pale PCN (_Globodera
pallida_) is now believed to be the more dominant species, while the
yellow or golden PCN (_Globodera rostochiensis_) still causes serious
losses in some areas. _G. pallida_ is only known in Newfoundland,
Canada in N. America but _G. rostochiensis_ is known in New York
State in mainland USA and on Vancouver Island, British Columbia and
Newfoundland in Canada. Because of an effective US State and Federal
quarantine which has been in existence for over 50 years, PCN/GN
remains confined to portions of 9 counties within the State of New
York (see link for a map of these counties).
The article in item [1] provides a good summary of the steps taken to
regulate and stop the spread of the PCN/GN in NY State. It points out
that resistant varieties developed especially for this problem and
region have been effective. The appearance of a new strain/pathotype
Ro2 of the golden nematode in this area is now causing concern
because acceptable resistant varieties for this strain have not been
developed. In the absence of resistant varieties, PCN/GN Ro2 may be
better able to increase and spread than the old strain. The nematodes
only move a maximum of about one m in the soil. Most movement to new
localities is by passive transport. The main routes of spread are
infested seed potatoes and movement of soil (e.g. on farm machinery)
from infested land to other areas. On one farm featured in the
article, the Ro2 strain has spread from 20 acres in 2000 to at least
60 of the 120 or so acres planted with potatoes in 2006, according to
the grower. The long term consequences for the export of crops to
mainland Canada and elsewhere is spelled out in the article.
In Illinois a different nematode, the soybean cyst nematode
(SCN)_Heterodera glycines_, is discussed in item [2] for similar
reasons, but without the impact and consequences of quarantine and
regulation. SCN is a major and common pathogen of soybean (_Glycine
max_). Like the PCN, above ground disease symptoms include stunted
plants in patches, and below ground the plants have poor root
systems. The cysts of the nematode, which are the size of a pinhead,
are associated with the roots. Resistant soybean varieties that have
traditionally been grown to manage losses associated with the
nematode are no longer offering acceptable levels of resistance,
presumably because of the selection of new strains of the pathogen.
The lack of clear above ground symptoms other than poor growth means
growers need to test the roots of their plants for cysts and their
soil for nematode populations if they are to assess the impact of the
nematode.
