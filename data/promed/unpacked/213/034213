Officials say a vial containing a virus that can cause [Venezuelan]hemorrhagic fever has gone missing from a research facility in Galveston,but say there's no reason to believe there's a threat to the public.

The University of Texas Medical Branch [UTMB] said Saturday that there was no breach in the security [of] its Galveston National Laboratory and no indication of wrongdoing. Officials suspect the missing vial containing the Guanarito virus was destroyed during the lab's cleaning process but the investigation continues.

The medical branch says the virus, native to Venezuela, is transmitted only through contact with Venezuelan rats. It is not believed to be able to survive in U.S. rodents or to be transmitted person-to-person.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was immediately notified after the vial was discovered missing Wednesday.

[Guanarito (GTOV) virus is an arenavirus related to other South American hemorrhagic fever viruses. The state of Portuguesa, Venezuela had 618 human cases in 1989-2006. The case fatality rate is 23 per cent. The UTMB facility is a WHO reference laboratory with an internationally recognized staff of highly competent professionals. The above situation is likely due to the circumstances described above -- inadvertent disposal of a sterilized (autoclaved) vial of the virus. GTOV is on the list of select agents, but is not tier one.

The short-tailed cane mouse (Zygodontomys brevicauda) is the main host for GTOV, and an image can be seen at http://animal.memozee.com/WebImg/402/1208937766-t.jpg
