----------------------------------------------------------------------
To address the AHS [African horse sickness] situation:

The season started late due to heavy rains and widespread flooding
but we have isolates from all the provinces except the W. Cape (our
export area). There are already 5 of the 9 serotypes namely 1, 2, 4,
5, and 6.

By early April last year [2008], we were about 30 cases further ahead
and we had more serotypes as well.

[In our posting 20090401.1255, the following RFI was included:
"information on the identity of the AHSV serotype involved will be
appreciated". We are grateful to Dr Gerdes for the kind, first-hand
response above and commend the persistent, exemplary transparency of
the Onderstepoort laboratory.
