A newborn baby from Adelaide has died in hospital after contracting meningococcal disease.

SA [South Australia] Health confirmed on Sunday [8 Nov 2020] it had been notified of a case of invasive meningococcal disease in a 7-week-old girl. "Tragically, the baby has died in hospital," a statement said.

Multiple people were in contact with the child, with 7 told to take clearance antibiotics.

Medical experts are yet to identify the exact strain of meningococcus that infected the newborn baby.

A total of 5 cases of invasive meningococcal disease have been reported in SA this year [2020], well down from the 25 to the same time in 2019. Of those 5 cases, 2 were serogroup B, 2 serogroup Y, and 1 is awaiting typing. There were 27 invasive meningococcal cases reported statewide in 2019, with 19 from serogroup B and 4 apiece from serogroup W and Y.

[Meningitis in infants and young children can be caused by a variety of bacteria. In infants aged less than 2 months, group B _Streptococcus_ causes most cases in the United States; _Listeria monocytogenes_ is also seen in this age group. With routine use of _Hemophilus influenzae_ type b and pneumococcal vaccines for infants and children in the United States, incidence of these pathogens has been reduced, leaving _Neisseria meningitidis_ as one of the most important causes of bacterial meningitis in infants and young children. The age-specific incidence rate of _N. meningitidis_ meningitis is highest among infants aged less than 1 year (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4803024/).

_N. meningitidis_ infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10% of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common. In the US, serogroup B was responsible for 64%, C for 12%, and Y for 16% of cases of meningococcal meningitis in infants.

Immunity following the use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. There are vaccines that contain capsular polysaccharide (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to a protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat, and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

Following the mass introduction into the population of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically. In Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there was a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).

In Australia, a single funded dose of conjugated meningococcal ACWY vaccine (MenACWY) is scheduled at 12 months of age. A single dose of conjugated MenACWY vaccine is also given to adolescents through a school-based program (14-to 16-year-olds) (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020).

For all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, meningococcal serogroup B vaccine (MenB) is given at 2 and 4 months (can be given from 6 weeks of age) (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020). Additional doses of MenB and MenACWY is given for children with specified medical risk conditions, such as splenia/hyposplenia, complement deficiency, and those undergoing treatment with eculizumab (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/national-immunisation-program-schedule#national-immunisation-program-schedule-from-1-july-2020).

Invasive meningococcal disease is more common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/meningococcal-vaccines-in-australia-a-2019-update). In 2019, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had a 10-fold greater incidence of meningococcal disease than the non-indigenous across some age-groups. The most common strains causing infection were types B and W (https://mvec.mcri.edu.au/immunisation-references/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-immunisation-recommendations/). We are not told in the news report above if the infant with meningococcal infection was an Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander.

Adelaide, with a population of over 1.3 million residents in 2018, is the capital city of the state of South Australia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide). A map showing the location of Adelaide can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Adelaide+SA,+Australia. - Mod.ML]
