NORWALK-LIKE VIRUS, CRUISE SHIP - USA (FL) (10)

[In my comment on the ProMED-mail post entitled "Norwalk-like virus, cruise
ship - USA (FL) (09)", I wrote: "It is unclear from these reports of
independent outbreaks on different cruise ships whether there has been
laboratory confirmation of the identity of the organism in all cases, or
whether the same species/strain of Norwalk-like virus is responsible." The
following rapid response from Sally van Boheemen of Holland America
supplies some much-needed data. - Mod.CP]

MS Amsterdam outbreak: Norwalk virus confirmed
----------------------------------------------
We did have laboratory confirmation on 8 specimens sent to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. All 8 (from those on board the MS
Amsterdam) were positive for Norwalk virus.
