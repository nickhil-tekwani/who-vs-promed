A total of 523 Chinese villagers suffered from food poisoning symptoms after eating durian from a capsized cargo ship in Guangxi on 26 Aug 2020, the local disease control center announced on Tuesday [1 Sep 2020], the state media said. A later investigation showed that they were infected with _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, which, when ingested, causes gastrointestinal illness in humans, and was probably caused by the durian becoming contaminated by sea water.

An announcement from the local government on 27 Aug 2020 said 101 of the villagers suffered from abdominal pains, diarrhea, and vomiting while others only displayed mild symptoms. 9 people are currently in hospital. Video clips circulating online showed the villagers rushing to the sea to try and recover durian floating on the sea water's surface, after a cargo ship loaded with durian overturned around 200 meters away from the coast of Dongxing in Guangxi on 26 Aug 2020. Local authorities tried to stop the villagers, but they still managed to recover some durian.

Associated with salt or brackish water, the _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ bacterium is a microorganism commonly found in food poisoning cases in coastal areas in the summer and autumn months, Guangxi Center for Disease Prevention and Control said. It often lurks in fish, shrimp, crab, shellfish, and other seafood, and occasionally spreads through salted products like pickles, seasoned meats, and salted eggs. It is suspected the durian, soaked in sea water, could have been contaminated with the microorganism.

Experts said the incubation period for those infected with the bacterium ranges from 1 hour to 4 days, but lasts 10 hours in most cases. The symptoms resulting from its ingestion start quickly, and include chills, abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting, followed by fever, diarrhea, and watery or bloody stool.

[It seems clear that the durian fruit were contaminated by exposure to the ocean water. Durian (_Durio zibethinus_, https://www.britannica.com/plant/durian) is a tree of the hibiscus, or mallow, family (Malvaceae) and its large edible fruit. The durian is cultivated in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, and southern Thailand and is seldom exported. Although the durian has a mild sweet flavor, it also has a pungent odour, which has been compared to that of Limburger cheese; for this reason, the fruit is banned from public transportation in some places. The custardlike pulp can be eaten at various stages of ripeness and is used in a variety of sweet and savory dishes. The seeds may also be eaten if roasted.

It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ spp. or _Escherichia coli_. It is commonest in warmer waters such as those of, in the western hemisphere, the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as in Washington State, Alaska, and British Columbia, accentuated by global warming, can also be associated with shellfish-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

Indeed, eating raw shellfish only during months containing an "r" in its name may decrease eating them during the warmer months (May, June, July, and August), but only in the northern hemisphere (it should be reversed below the equator). However, since global warming has occurred, and with the shellfish being shipped quickly from warmer to colder areas, the old adage is not very helpful anymore. - Mod.LL
