Shigellosis cases reach epidemic point
----------------------------------------
An outbreak of a diarrhea-causing illness has become an epidemic in
Cincinnati, but people can protect themselves simply by washing their
hands.
More than 700 cases of shigellosis, an infection caused by _Shigella_
bacteria, have been confirmed. City health department officials say
only 13 were confirmed in 2000 and 21 in 1999. The last time more than
a few dozen cases were confirmed was in 1995, when 157 people were
stricken.
Symptoms of shigellosis
 Symptoms of shigellosis are diarrhea, fever, stomach cramping,
nausea and vomiting, particularly in children and the elderly.
 Many adults infected with the disease experience only mild or no
apparent symptoms, meaning some people can be unwitting carriers.
We've seen more confirmed cases of it this year than we've seen in
the last 10 years combined, said Dr. Judith Daniels, medical director
of the Cincinnati Health Department. She said incidents of the disease
are scattered throughout Hamilton County, and it hasn't reached its
peak yet -- the numbers are still going up.
Northern Kentucky has 16 confirmed cases; it's likely, but not
certain, that the children affected in Northern Kentucky were exposed
while in Cincinnati.
The highly contagious bacteria are spread through the feces of an
infected person. People who don't wash their hands after using the
bathroom or changing a diaper are likely carriers.
Almost all of the cases have been among the diaper crowd --
diaper-age children and their caregivers, said Dr. Daniels. That
indicates the likely cause isn't an infected water source or
contaminated food, but children spreading the disease by putting
contaminated objects in their mouths.
Small children don't always have impeccable hygiene, shall we say,
Dr. Daniels said. Once it gets introduced into children in diapers,
or who have just gotten out of diapers, the organism literally gets
passed from child to child, and eventually to older brothers and
sisters, parents, daycare staff and other caregivers.
Dr. Daniels said washing hands after using the bathroom or changing
diapers and before touching food is the best way to avoid spreading
the bacteria.
The usual treatment is 5 days of antibiotics.
Infected people likely to spread it to others -- food handlers,
caregivers and health workers, for example -- are asked to avoid those
activities until they test negative.
Parents who notice 2 or more loose stools in children over a 24-hour
period, particularly if they are very watery or contain mucus or
blood, should have them tested for shigellosis by a pediatrician, she
said.
