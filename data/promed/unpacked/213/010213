Two die in cholera outbreak near Beir Bridge
-------------------------------------------
In an outbreak in Tongwe, near Zimbabwe's Beit Bridge, 2 people have died
of cholera, forcing authorities to close the local school to contain the
spread of the disease.
In addition, 24 people in the area have tested positive for the illness
since 1 Dec 2002, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) spokeswoman
Muriel Mafico told IRIN [UN Integrated Regional Information Networks? -
Mod.SH] on Monday. The Minister of Health had seconded additional staff to
the district to help, and UNICEF would send urgent help where required,
Mafico said. It was not yet known what had caused the outbreak.
The Daily News reported that the Health Ministry had set up control teams
at Tongwe School and in major business centers and were disinfecting
boreholes in the area. The Tongwe outbreak comes after a similar outbreak
in nearby Masvingo province in August 2002, which Mafico said had now
stabilized.
A number of organizations, including the Red Cross, have been supporting
the government's efforts and funding was currently being finalised to
provide a cholera specialist for the government.
The World Food Program warned, however, that Masvingo was one of a number
of provinces experiencing severe food shortages. Inadequate nutrition and
poor water sources are known to fuel the disease, which can also leave
families too weak to tend to important food crops.

Cholera claims 7 more
---------------------
Seven more people have died of cholera in Bikita District in the last few
weeks, bringing the total number of people killed so far by the disease in
Masvingo province to 35. The deaths were reported in Duwure Extension,
Angus Farm, and Village 26 in Bikita bordering Chiredzi. Masvingo
provincial medical director Dr Tapiwa Magure said medical teams had already
been dispatched to the area to verify the situation. "We received the
message that 7 people have died of cholera and we have sent a team to
verify the issue," Dr Magure said.
There are fears that more people could lose their lives if no contingency
measures are taken to increase the number of health workers who are
reportedly failing to contain the situation.
"We established monitoring centers in the affected areas, but they are
failing to cope with the situation, raising the prospect of more loss of
life," said Dr Magure. He said that, as of last week, 549 cases of cholera
have been reported in Masvingo Province in 2002.

Cholera hits Hoima, Kanese
--------------------------
The heavy rainy season due to El Nino is already showing one of its bad
sides. Health officials in Hoima confirmed on Fri 8 Nov 2002 that at least
5 people had died within a week of a fresh cholera outbreak in Bugambe. Dr
Mathew Emel, the district director of health services, said the source of
the infection was a fishing village in Buseruka on the shores of Lake
Albert. He said isolated cases of cholera had always occurred on the shores
of Lake Albert, and it could be spreading out because of El Nino rains.
Emel said the new outbreak in Bugambe affected so many people within a
short time because of the Islamic practice of washing dead bodies before
burial. "It is sporadic, but our surveillance system has arrested the
situation," he said.
Dr Tomson Kyahurwenda, the area member of parliament, described the
outbreak as unfortunate. "It was discovered late that it was cholera, but
the situation is improving. People are being mobilised and have taken
preventive measures," he said. Official statistics from the health
department in Hoima put the death toll at 5, but local sources said the
figure could be double that. Two pupils of Kiduma Church of Uganda Primary
School were among the victims.
Another cholera outbreak in Kasese district has claimed at least 4 people,
while 14 others have been admitted to hospital. The outbreak occurred at
Lubirika at the Uganda-Congo border. Officials suspect the highly
anticipated El Nino rains have led to deterioration of hygiene in homes and
public places. It is feared such cases could happen anywhere because of the
severe rains. The last time Uganda experienced El Nino was in 1997. It
sparked cholera that spread to over 40 districts, affected over 50 000
people, and killed more than 2000.

Hundreds of Somalis hospitalized in capital for diarrhea
--------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of people, mainly children under the age of 5, are now being
hospitalized in Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, for severe diarrhea. The
diarrhea, which the doctors earlier characterized as what they called
seasonal diarrhea, now seems to be getting out of hand as hospitals in the
capital city are being flooded with dozens of children each day suffering
from the disease.
According to Dr Abdulkarim Asseyr of the World Health Organization in
Mogadishu, there is now a considerable number of cholera cases in Mogadishu
and its surrounding areas. Since the beginning of November 2002, Benadir
hospital has received 160 children suffering from diarrhea, 5 of whom have
died of the disease.
Al-Hayat hospital, another major hospital in Mogadishu, has admitted 298
children suffering from the disease, but only one has died, while still
more than 70 are being treated in the hospital. Likewise, Habeb hospital is
treating nearly 100 more, but no deaths have been reported from there.
According to Dr Asseyr, the more than 800 shallow water wells in Mogadishu
are also another factor which facilitates the spread of the disease, since
their depth is at just the same level as the toilets in the city. Likewise,
the dirty water buckets in the streets of Mogadishu these days as a result
of the rains are likewise infiltrating into the shallow water wells
carrying the germs.
The doctors have agreed that those suffering from the disease are mainly
the internally displaced people who live in the dozens of refugee camps
scattered in the capital. These refugees, thousands of them, live in
makeshift huts and in appalling conditions in terms of sanitation.
