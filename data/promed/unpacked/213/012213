Foot and Mouth Disease in cattle in Israel, 10 Mar 2011: Preliminary
Outbreak Assessment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Israel has reported to the OIE an outbreak of FMD [seroype O] in
cattle in the Hazafon region (OIE, 2011; see maps at
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10345
and
http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=10529)
on 10 Mar 2011.

Situation assessment:
The Middle East is considered to be endemic for FMD and incursions
into Israel do occur despite a compulsory vaccination programme (Stram
et al, 2011)[see Ref 1]. FMD outbreaks appear to be seasonal in
Israel, with peak incidence during the early months of the year
(Defra, 2009
http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/fmd-me-update-090620.pdf).
Nevertheless, the last previous occurrence of the disease in the
country was in 2009 with 14 outbreaks of FMD serotype A (Strain: Iran
05BAR-08) between February and July. Prior to 2009, the FMD-O serotype
appeared to predominate in the region (Stram et al, 2011)[Ref 1].

The current outbreak is in close proximity to Israel's border with
Jordan (2 miles) and Syria (4 miles). Both Jordan and Syria reported
FMD as absent in the 1st half of 2010 although the Middle East
generally is reported to be an FMD endemic area (Stram et al, 2011)
and it is thought that the political instability and limited resources
has led to the uncontrolled circulation of FMD virus throughout the
region (Alkhamis, et al. 2009) [Ref 2]. It will be of interest to see
whether this outbreak is a reemergence of the same strain or a new
incursion. Stram et al. (2011) reported that sequenced representative
samples from 1989 - 2007 suggested that almost every new outbreak in
Israel was initiated by introduction of a new virus lineage (with
virus differentiation for each successive outbreak of between 6.5 -
15.1 percent) and not by endemic and resident viruses.

[21 sequenced FMD samples, derived during 2011 in Israel, are
displayed in the genotyping pages of the WRLFMD (see at
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/isr.htm]. They belong to 3
batches submitted to Pirbright on 23 Mar 2011 (2 samples), 8 Jun 2011
(6 samples) and 8 Sep 2011 (13 samples). All of them are of serotype
O, Topotype ME-SA, Genotype/strain: PanAsia-2 (ANT-10). A visit to the
displayed dendogram will show that there have probably been 2
introductions of 2 strains. One cluster includes samples 1, 2 and 4.
The other one, closely related to Kuwaiti 2011 strains, include 18
samples: 5, 6, 7, 9, 22 and 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 23, 24,
25, 26; see
http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2011/WRLFMD-2011-00038%20O%20Israel%202011.pdf.


As suggested by DEFRA'a assessment, it will be of interest to see
whether this outbreak is a reemergence of the previous strain(s) or a
new incursion, as might be anticipated in view of the findings in Ref
1. Inclusion of Israeli isolates from earlier years in the dendogram
could have provided the answer.

It would also be useful if the list of 10 "Most Closely Related
Reference Viruses" in the WRLFMD tabled reports, include relevant
vaccine strains. The FMDV-O strains currently included in the vaccine
used in Israel are Manisa 67, Geshur 85 and Turkey 3039. Are they the
right, relevant ones to protect against the currently circulating
strain(s)? This information is of importance regionally and beyond;
genotyping will help. - Mod.AS]
