"Sheep pox and goat pox are contagious viral diseases of small ruminants. These diseases may be mild in indigenous breeds living in endemic areas, but they are often fatal in newly introduced animals. Economic losses result from decreased milk production, damage to the quality of hides and wool, and other production losses. Sheep pox and goat pox can limit trade, inhibit the development of intensive livestock production, and prevent new breeds of sheep or goats from being imported into endemic regions." http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/sheep_and_goat_pox.pdf. - Mod.CRD
