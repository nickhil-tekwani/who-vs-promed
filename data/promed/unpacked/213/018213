Paraguay: Dengue Virus Serotype 3 Reported in Frontier Region with Brazil
--------------------------------------------------
Paraguayan health authorities have sounded an alert. The Ministry of
Public Health confirmed 3 cases of dengue virus type 3 infection in
Pedro Juan Caballero, 540 km northeast of Asuncion [the capital], out
of a total of 10 suspect cases. Since 1989 Paraguay has reported
outbreaks of dengue virus serotype 1, mostly in Asuncion and the
frontier areas with Argentina and Brazil, but no fatalities.
Currently various Brazilian and Argentinian cities close to the
Paraguayan frontier, and the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, are
reporting foci of dengue fever. Santa Cruz is reported to have 300
confirmed cases and 2 deaths, the Argentinian provinces of Salta and
Misiones more than 260, and the Iguazu Falls in Brazil [on the
Paraguayan frontier] 21 cases.

Paraguay: Dengue Virus Serotype 3 - Alert
-----------------------------------------
The confirmation of circulation of dengue virus serotype 3 in the
community of Pedro Juan Caballero has placed Paraguay under a state
of alert. The more than 600 000 people who already had a dengue
serotype 1 infection run the risk of developing hemorrhagic
manifestations in case of a second infection by a different serotype.
10 cases of dengue serotype 3 were confirmed in the Bernardino
Caballero district of Pedro Juan Caballero. None have presented
hemorrhagic manifestations of the disease, but there are another 2000
people in this city at risk of acquiring dengue hemorrhagic fever
[DHF] if they become infected again.
The Ministry of Health has declared an epidemiological alert in the
whole country. Jose Antonio Mayans, Minister of Health, stated that
it is a very serious situation and that, while the intention is not
to alarm the population, it is necessary to take every responsible
measure when addressing these cases. The Ministry's greatest concern
lies in the inability of hospitals to deal with severe cases should
there be an epidemic. In a worst-case scenario, if dengue virus
serotype 3 disseminates, and the 600 000 susceptible Paraguayans
become reinfected, 10 percent (around 60 000 people) could develop
the hemorrhagic form of the disease, and of these, 10 percent would
be very serious, life-threatening cases.
In addition, DHF could be very costly to the public health system.
While the cost of treatment of classic dengue fever is approximately
400 000 guarani [approximately US $58], including laboratory tests,
the cost of the treatment of DHF could exceed 7 million guarani
[around US $1000]. A DHF patient does not require intensive care but
does require around-the-clock physician care during the acute stage
of the disease. It is evident that the Public Health Ministry, with
its scarce resources, is in no condition to face an epidemic.
As a preventive measure, Senepa [National Service for the Eradication
of Malaria] is attempting to contain risk within the high-risk area,
and last Thursday fumigated 106 blocks in the districts of Maria
Victoria, Bernardino Caballero, and Guarani. However, on Friday, the
rain reduced the effectiveness of the pesticide treatment.
Health authorities are urging all people with fever to visit a
physician so that they may detect suspected cases and restrict
movement to and from the affected area. The Central Laboratory offers
blood tests for dengue fever at no cost. Authorities are also urging
residents to organize groups to clean houses, public ways, and
abandoned lots. Some communities have designated days when employees
can be absent from work and participate in the cleaning project.
Carlos Romero, Director of Senepa, has complained that the
municipality of Asuncion, where the index of mosquito infestation is
80 percent, is not cooperating.
Since 1989, Paraguay has reported epidemic outbreaks of dengue fever
type 1 or classic dengue fever, mostly in Asuncion and in communities
along the borders with Argentina and Brazil, but no deaths have been
reported. An outbreak of dengue fever is currently affecting several
Brazilian and Argentine cities close to the border with Paraguay, as
well as the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz, where more than 300
confirmed cases and 2 deaths have been registered. The provinces of
Salta and Misiones in Argentina have reported more than 260 cases,
and Foz de Iguazu in Brazil has reported 21 cases.
Romero, a member of a multidisciplinary committee created to combat
the disease, stated that the situation is critical, and that efforts
must be redoubled, since recent rains in the whole country could
cause a 30 percent increase in the index of mosquito infestation. He
asked the population to collaborate in the elimination of mosquito
breeding sites, warning that a repeat infection by the new serotype
could develop into the hemorrhagic form of the disease, requiring
hospitalization, and that an epidemic could overwhelm the health
system.

Argentina: Statement from the Ministry of Health
------------------------------------------------
The National Coordination for Vector Control of the Ministry of
Health of the Republic of Argentina is submitting the following
report with respect to the note posted above, [reproduced from
ProMED-ESP of Mon 24 Feb 2003, see: PRO/ESP> Dengue, serotipo 3,
alerta - Paraguay 20030224.0472], concerning the appearance of dengue
virus serotype 3 in Paraguay and which refers to current cases of
dengue fever in the Argentine provinces of Salta and Misiones. As of
Thu 27 Feb 2003, there have been 2 cases of dengue fever on Argentine
territory: (1) S.S. Jujuy [Health Sector Jujuy], classified as an
imported case from Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia; and (2) San
Lorenzo (Santa Fe) also classified as an imported case, coming from
Urucui (Mato Grosso, Brazil).
In addition, there are 4 presumptive cases under investigation with
positive IgM results (UM-ELISA and MAC-ELISA) and 35 clinically
suspected cases from Jujuy and Salta. Of the 260 cases that were
referred to [in the above ProMED-mail posting], it is important to
clarify that these cases occurred in 2002, during an outbreak in
Salta due to dengue virus serotype 1 (DEN-1), whereas in Misiones,
during the same period, there was only one case reported, an imported
case of dengue virus serotype 3 (DEN-3) from Brazil.

Ecuador: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Total Reaches 24 for 2003
-------------------------------------------------
In total, 24 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) have now been
reported in Ecuador during 2003, according to statistics released
today by the National Sub-secretariat of Tropical Medicine; 21 of
those cases are from Guayas province.
Last week the first death from DHF was registered, a 13-year-old
child [sex not specified] in Manabi, in the southwest, one of the 12
provinces which have been declared by the government to be in a state
of medical and health emergency [due to dengue].
In 2002, 14 cases of DHF and 6688 of classic dengue fever were reported.

Australia: 3 Dengue Fever Cases in Cairns Under Observation
--------------------------------------------------
3 people in Cairns are believed to have the potentially fatal
mosquito-borne disease dengue fever. The Tropical Public Health Unit
says the men, aged in their 30s and 50s, are believed to have
contracted the disease at their workplace. They have been unwell but
so far have escaped serious illness. Scientific officer Brian
Montgomery says others could have been infected in the 10 days since
the men were bitten. "We're a bit concerned because we don't know
where they contracted the infection -- where the first case came from
-- so we're performing control operations and really trying to alert
the public that it's very important that they empty their containers
around the yards," he said.

Saudi Arabia: 7 Cases of Suspected Dengue Fever in Jeddah
--------------------------------------------------
7 cases of dengue fever have been detected in Jeddah, according to a
source at the Jeddah Regional Laboratory. 7 Saudis (5 males and 2
females) have come down with dengue fever. The disease is in its
early stage. All the cases are under control and have been
treated.The source said the mosquito-borne infection was not a
byproduct of this year's Haj, as the victims were Saudis who did not
perform the pilgrimage. The number of detected cases was small and
therefore the situation is not considered dangerous, he added.
Several hemorrhagic fever cases were detected in the Saudi town of
Alkhorma, and as a result the causative virus has been named the
Alkhorma virus. It was a severe form of hemorrhagic fever which has
killed 2 people, the source said.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) was first recognized in the 1950s
during the dengue epidemics in the Philippines and Thailand, but
today DHF affects most Asian countries and has become a leading cause
of hospitalization and death among children in several of them. There
are 4 distinct but closely related viruses that cause dengue fever.
Recovery from infection by one provides lifelong immunity against
that serotype but confers only partial and transient protection
against subsequent infection by the other 3. There is good evidence
that sequential infection increases the risk of more serious disease
resulting in DHF.
The global prevalence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent
decades. The disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in
Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia, and
the Western Pacific. Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific are most
seriously affected. Some 2.5 billion people are now at risk from
dengue. WHO estimates there may currently be 50 million cases of
dengue infection worldwide every year.
The spread of dengue is attributed to expanding geographic
distribution of the 4 dengue viruses and of their mosquito vectors,
the most important of which is the predominantly urban species _Aedes
aegypti_. A rapid rise in urban populations is bringing ever greater
numbers of people into contact with this vector, especially in areas
that are favorable for mosquito breeding, for example where household
water storage is common and where solid waste disposal services are
inadequate.
Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of
infective female _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Mosquitoes generally acquire the
virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person.
[Byline: Sarah Abuljadayel]
[This newswire report is ambiguous, and it is not clear whether the
diagnosis of dengue fever has been confirmed by laboratory tests.
Further information is needed to clarify the situation. Shamsudeen
Fagbo has appended the following commentary on the newswire report.
Previously dengue viruses of serotypes 1, 2, and 3 have been recorded
in Jeddah (see: Fakeeh M, Zaki AM. Virologic and serologic
surveillance for dengue fever in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 1994-1999. Am
J Trop Med Hyg 2001 Dec;65(6):764-7). - Mod.CP]
Commentary
The newswire seems to indicate that the dengue hemorrhagic fever
[DHF]-associated virus is the same as Alkhurma virus. Though both
viruses [dengue virus and Alkhurma virus] belong to the genus
_Flavivirus_ , the Alkhurma virus (ALKV ) is tick-transmitted and has
been genetically determined to belong to the tick-borne group of
flaviviruses [1]. Demonstrated genetic relationship with the Kyasanur
Forest Disease Virus (KFDV) from India suggests the 2 viruses share a
common ancestry. ALKV human infection is suggested to be caused by
contact with infected sheep or ticks feeding on sheep. A report of
its first description and isolation has been published [2]. However,
dengue virus is mosquito-borne, and no non-human animal is involved
in its epidemiology. Other differential diagnoses in the area should
include Rift Valley fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.
Indeed, this report indicates the presence of viable mosquito
populations in the locality capable of transmitting all these
hemorrhagic fever viruses and calls for more efforts towards vector
control. According to the unnamed source in the article, the
infection is not related to the recent Haj. Nonetheless, it is
possible that viremic pilgrims visited Jeddah and infected local
mosquitoes. Further investigations may yield more information.

Saudi Arabia: Alkhurma Virus Implicated as Etiologic Agent
--------------------------------------------------
The discovery of 7 cases of dengue fever here has raised concern
among the general public. They are complaining that they are not
being provided enough information about the disease, which caused an
epidemic in the Kingdom in 1994. 4 of the 7 cases of dengue fever in
Jeddah were treated at the Al-Fakeeh Hospital, and all of the
individuals have fully recovered, Dr. Ali Zaki of the Virology
Laboratory at Al-Fakeeh Hospital in Jeddah told Arab News yesterday.
Dr. Zaki isolated the dengue virus in 1994, and also has among his
credits being the first person to discover the Alkhurma strain of the
virus.
People living in the Faisaliya and Bawadi districts of Jeddah are
apparently most at risk at present, since the districts are the main
centers of infected mosquito activity. But conditions in the city
generally are ripe for the disease to spread. Jeddah is full of pools
of stagnant water, overflowing septic tanks, a rising water table
coming up through holes in pavements and on waste ground, leaking
sewage tankers, leaking water pipes, and inadequate -- if not
non-existent -- drainage.
"Today it is much easier to detect dengue in the Kingdom than it was
in 1994, because we now have a ready-made kit especially designed for
that purpose, and if patients come to us within 4 days of being
infected, they recover much faster," Dr. Zaki said. The Alkhurma
strain of the virus was detected by Dr. Zaki in 1994 and named after
the Saudi town of Alkhurma.
The Alkhurma virus (ALKV) is a tick-borne flavivirus responsible for
hemorrhagic fever in humans. The first symptoms include vomiting,
epigastric pain, diarrhea, and hematemesis for more than 4 days. The
patient also suffers from an elevated liver enzyme, Dr. Zaki told
Arab News. Dr. Zaki explained that all the Alkhurma patients had a
history of direct contact with animals and meat.
The main difference between dengue virus and the Alkhurma strain is
that dengue is spread by mosquitoes, while Alkhurma can be caught
through direct contact with animals and fresh meat, and is spread
only by ticks. The first 6 patients were actually butchers. The
fatality rate of the Alkhurma virus is much higher than that of
dengue; 2 of the 16 cases so far discovered have been fatal, compared
with only one in every 1000 for dengue.
Trial vaccines are now being tested, Zaki said, but the disease is
not 100 percent curable. The only solution is to control the
mosquitoes and avoid direct contact with animals.
[Byline: Sarah Abuljadayel]
[This second report implicates Alkhurma virus (a tick-borne
flavivirus) as the causative agent, rather than the mosquito-borne
dengue virus; both viruses occur in Saudi Arabia. It is incorrect to
state that Alkhurma virus is a "strain" of dengue virus. Alkhurma
virus is a distinct virus species responsible for a distinctive
disease syndrome. Alkhurma virus belongs to the tick-borne group of
flaviviruses, which also includes Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus
(isolated in Siberia) and Kyasanur Forest disease virus (isolated in
India). Analysis of structural genes, genetic distances, and
evolutionary relationship indicate that Alkhurma virus and Kyasanur
Forest disease virus are derived from a common phylogenetic ancestor
and constitute 2 genetic subtypes of the same virus species according
to current genetic criteria of classification. (See Charrel, R.M., et
al. Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2001 Sep 21;287(2):455-61). Further
information on the current prevalence of both Alkhurma virus and
dengue virus in humans and animals in Saudi Arabia would be
appreciated. - Mod.CP]

Indonesia: Dengue Fever Approaching 5-year Peak in Jakarta
--------------------------------------------------
Jakartans should prepare themselves for one of the worst outbreaks of
dengue fever in years, as the city, one of the regions with a high
risk of dengue, will likely experience the peak of the disease's
5-year cycle this year, a health official said. "All elements of
society should anticipate the possibility of the worst outbreak of
this disease in years. Public participation is the key to minimizing
the spread of the disease," the City Health Agency spokeswoman Evy
Zelfiano told The Jakarta Post on Fri 28 Feb 2003. She estimated that
the worst months could be March and April.
Previously, the health ministry issued a warning that dengue fever
cases would jump significantly this year due to the 5-year cycle of
the outbreak. Citing the city health agency's data collected from
hospitals and health centers in the city, Evy said dengue fever
peaked at 15 360 cases in 1998, which is far higher than other years.
The city only recorded 5861 cases of dengue fever in 1995, 7081 cases
in 1996, 5190 cases in 1997, 3998 cases in 1999, 8729 cases in 2000,
8820 cases in 2001, and 5750 cases in 2002
More recent data show that dengue cases also began increasing in
January, when there were 505 cases, compared to the previous months,
which only reached 227 in December, 205 in November, 192 in October,
and 207 in September 2003. "As of Thu 27 Feb 2003, we have recorded
443 cases of dengue fever; therefore we should not be lackadaisical
about preparing for future pestilential outbreaks that may be loosed
upon the masses," Evy added.
According to Evy, the city recently began monitoring the cases
through hospitals and public health centers in each sub-district. She
said the agency would follow up on every public report of dengue with
an epidemiological investigation to confirm that the disease was
genuine in that area. "If we find that there are at least 2 persons
who suffer from the fever (in one area) without clear reasons, we
will work on the assumption that there is dengue proliferation
there," she said, adding that as a follow up of the finding, the
agency officers would examine larval matter from 20 houses in
surrounding areas. "If we find dengue-infected mosquito larvae from
only one of the houses, the city health agency will send the officers
to fumigate the whole area," said Evy. Evy stressed that public
participation in cleaning their areas was very important in
preventing the spread of the disease.
Evy said she did not know why dengue peaked every 5 years.
