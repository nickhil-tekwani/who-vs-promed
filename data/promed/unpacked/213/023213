In the southern African nation of Malawi trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, has caused residents to become ill from tiny parasites [trypanosomes] which are spread by the bite of the tsetse fly. The relocation of hundreds of elephants to Malawi's largest wildlife reserve was meant to be a sign of hope and renewal in this southern African nation. Then nearby residents began falling ill.

The cause of the headaches, weakness, and pain were trypanosomes spread by the bite of the tsetse fly -- a companion of the elephants. Trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is the result. Authorities said the Nkhotakota Wildlife Reserve has seen a surge in tsetse fly numbers since around 2015 when the elephants and other game animals were reintroduced.

The local hospital said it did not have a number of sleeping sickness cases. One community resident recalled at least 5 deaths from the disease.

The World Health Organization says sleeping sickness is endemic in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa but cases have been dropping. Last year [2018] just under 1000 cases were recorded, a new low. The majority of cases are reported in Congo.

Dr Janelisa Misaya, a Malawi College of Medicine principal investigator, underscored the need to control the tsetse fly population. "One tsetse can actually infect a lot of people at once," she said. "So we don't want to take chances." Some villagers expressed concern about the reintroduction of wildlife and the enlargement of the nearby reserve.

The African Parks field operations manager for the reserve, David Robertson, acknowledged that the reintroduction of animals in 2015 led to an increase in tsetse flies. "It is a bit ironic because it is a negative symptom of the success we are having," he said. "By increasing animal numbers, one of the unfortunate consequences could be an increase in tsetse fly numbers. Even though they are a natural part of the system, they contribute to biodiversity." The tsetse flies are something the parks workers need to manage differently, Robertson said. "We don't want to have neighboring communities or tourists to the park having an unpleasant experience or dangerous experience though contact with tsetse flies so we will do our best to manage that in the future."

To address the problem, African Parks in collaboration with Malawi's government has introduced pesticide-impregnated targets and traps that attract the flies. So far 600 have been placed in the wildlife reserve. They are placed near the edge of thickets in areas that will receive morning and evening light but are shaded from the most intense sunlight during midday hours. The area surrounding each is slashed and cleared with hoes to produce a firebreak to protect it from occasional wildfires.

Controlling the flies and animal populations are ways to help fight the disease. More assertive diagnosis and treatment are others. Local medical personnel are receiving more training to screen for and diagnose trypanosomiasis. The community has benefited from African Parks' support for screening efforts, said Tenson Mkumbwa, deputy lab manager at the Nkhotakota District Hospital. "This leads to early diagnosis and treatment," he said.

[ProMED-mail thanks John Frean and Lucille Blumberg for information on trypanosomiasis in wildlife, including elephants.

Many African game animals, including elephants, are reservoirs of _Trypanosoma brucei_. Antelopes are usually emphasised as the most important reservoirs rather than elephants.

The "less than 1000 cases/year" mostly refers to West African trypanosomiasis, which has a different epidemiology and a mainly human population reservoir. There are probably only about 100 cases of East African trypanosomiasis per year (Molyneux DH, Ashford RW. The Biology of _Trypanosoma_ and _Leishmania_. Parasites of Man and Animals. London: Taylor and Francis, 1983. pp. 140-43).

The vector, _Glossina_ spp. or tsetse flies feed on man, and a wide variety of domesticated and wild animals, reptiles, and birds. Thus it seems that it is the overall repopulation of the game reserve with wildlife that is responsible for an increase in the number of tsetse flies and the increase in human cases of trypanosomiasis. - Mod.EP
