I would like to comment on the observation made by Koos Coetzer and Bob
Swanepoel (posted on 22 Feb 1998) about the possible association of EHD
virus with the 1996 outbreak of stomatitis in cattle in South Africa. A
number of isolates of both bluetongue and EHD virus were in fact made from
clinical cases at that time.
Briefly - South Africa experienced above average rainfall in the Summer of
1996 which resulted in severe outbreaks of most of the major vector-borne
diseases (excluding RVF). Cattle were presenting with lacrimation,
salivation, stomatitis, coronitis, nose and teat sloughs, haemorrhagic
diarrhoea and a drop in milk production. Within individual herds, morbidity
and mortality was generally low. 13 bluetongue virus isolates, serotypes
2,3,6 and 8 with a predominance of type 2 and 9 as yet untyped EHD virus
isolates were made. These isolations came mostly from blood, a few from
_Culicoides_ midge pools and an EHD isolate from a spleen sample.
Although only sporadic isolations of EHD virus have been made in the past
and bluetongue is fairly readily isolated from asymptomatic cattle in South
Africa during the summer months, we believe that the massive vector (and
virus) challenge created conditions favouring the epizootic and that there
is evidence for a causal relationship between one or both of the viruses and
the erosive stomatitis syndrome seen in 1996.
