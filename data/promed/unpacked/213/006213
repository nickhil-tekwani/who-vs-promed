The New Mexico Department of Health [NMDOH] is reporting the state's 1st human plague case of 2020. Officials said a Santa Fe County man in his 60s has been diagnosed with bubonic plague.

"This is a reminder that even during a pandemic, other infectious diseases are out that that can still put your health at risk," NMDOH Secretary Kathy Kunkel said. "All New Mexicans need to be aware of the risks for contracting diseases like plague and take the necessary precautions to avoid them."

According to the health department, the man is recovering at a local hospital while officials investigate any ongoing risks to immediate family members, neighbors, and others in the surrounding community.

To prevent plague, the NMDOH issued the following recommendations:
- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows;
- prevent pets from roaming and hunting;
- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets as not all products are safe for cats, dogs, or your children;
- clean up areas near the home where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk and abandoned vehicles;
- have sick pets examined promptly by a veterinarian;
- see your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever;
- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;
- don't leave your pet's food and water where rodents and wildlife can get to it.

Symptoms include the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. Health officials said in most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck area. Plague symptoms in dogs and cats are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. A dog in Santa Fe County was also diagnosed with the plague in 2020. In New Mexico, there was one human plague case in 2019 and none in 2018. With prompt diagnosis and antibacterial treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced.

["The typical sign of the most common form of human plague is a swollen and very tender lymph gland, accompanied by pain. The swollen gland is called a "bubo". Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2-6 days after being infected.

"When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream (septicemic plague). As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antimicrobial therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. About 14% (one in 7) of all plague cases in the United States are fatal." (https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/Departments-and-Agencies/DPH/dph/communications/CERC/PlagueFSwebpdf.pdf)

In recent decades, an average of 7 human plague cases have been reported each year in the United States (range: 1-17 cases per year) (https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html). Most cases of _Yersinia pestis_ infections in the USA occur in the area of the "Four Corner" states: Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, although California and, to a lesser extent, Oregon also may have cases. - Mod.LL
