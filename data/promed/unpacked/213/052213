The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that about 48 million people, or 1 in 6 people in the USA, get sick from eating contaminated food. During a CDC telebriefing today [18 Apr 2013], Dr Rob Tauxe, deputy director of CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases and colleagues reported on the nation's annual Food Safety Report Card based on data from the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet).

Dr Tauxe says _Salmonella_ still tops the list as the most common agent diagnosed of those tracked by FoodNet. However, Tauxe notes, "The frequency of salmonellosis in general in the population that FoodNet follows has remained constant over time since 1996. Now, that constancy masks some changes because the type of _Salmonella_ that used to be the most common, which is called serotype Typhimurium has actually decreased substantially over time.

"Unfortunately, other types have increased, so the total number has not changed. Perhaps this represents some success that salmonellosis have not increased over time, but the fact that we're still where we were a decade ago means that further efforts will be needed to prevent more salmonellosis and bring that number of infections lower than they are now."

While the occurrence of salmonellosis has remained unchanged, other causes of foodborne illness have increased, some dramatically.

The 2nd most common, _Campylobacter_, which is linked to many foods, including poultry, raw milk, and produce -- has risen up to 14 percent in 2012 compared to 2006-2008. They were at their highest level since 2000.

Another organism, usually related to eating oysters and other shellfish, increased dramatically according to CDC data. _Vibrio_ infections, not _Vibrio vulnificus_ but _V. parahaemolyticus_ as a whole were up 43 percent when compared with the rates observed in 2006-2008.

Concerning _E. coli_ O157, Dr Tauxe said, "The levels in 2012 are similar to those that were observed in 2006-2008. And past declines, substantial declines, in _E. coli_ O157 were observed following regulatory change and improvements in the food industry that particularly targeted ground beef, and it is still the case now that numbers are lower than they were back in the 1990s, but this -- the recent modest increase in the last couple of years means that we're right now just about where we were in 2006-2008."

"Our food supply remains one of the safest in the world," said CDC Director Tom Frieden, MD, MPH. "However, some foodborne diseases continue to pose a challenge. We have the ability, through investments in emerging technologies, to identify outbreaks even more quickly and implement interventions even faster to protect people from the dangers posed by contaminated food."

FoodNet collects information to track rates and determine trends in laboratory-confirmed illnesses caused by 9 pathogens transmitted commonly by food: _Campylobacter_, _Cryptosporidium_, _Cyclospora_, _Listeria_, _Salmonella_, enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) O157 and non-O157, _Shigella_, _Vibrio_, and _Yersinia_. Annual data are compared with data from a recent period (2006-2008) and with data from the 1st years of surveillance (1996-1998) to measure progress.

FoodNet is a collaboration among CDC, 10 state health departments, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, and the FDA. FoodNet covers 48 million people, encompassing about 15 percent of the American population. The sites are the states of Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, and Tennessee, and selected counties in California, Colorado, and New York.

In 2012, the FoodNet surveillance program identified about 19 500 infections, about 4500 hospitalizations, and 68 deaths.
