The rate of syphilis infection in British Columbia [Canada] is the highest it's been in 30 years, and the provincial health officer is asking the public to get proactive about testing and treatment. Figures from the BC [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control show there were 919 new cases of syphilis reported in 2018, a 33% jump from the year before [2017], and many of those infections occurred in gay and bisexual men.

Dr Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer, says after watching rates decrease for several years, they're now climbing again, and they're working to raise awareness that people need to be tested. There has also been an increase in cases among women, prompting the province to temporarily change syphilis screening during pregnancy to add a 2nd test near delivery in addition to the routine test in the 1st trimester. Untreated infection during pregnancy can lead to premature birth, low birth weight, long-term neurological issues, deafness, or even stillbirth.

A syphilis outbreak was declared in Alberta in July [2019] as health officials recorded a 187% increase from 2017 to 2018, and rates in Saskatchewan and Manitoba also jumped during the same period.

Syphilis is a bacterial infection that can be cured with antibiotics, but left untreated, it can lead to serious complications including damage to the brain, heart, and other organs. Infections can have no symptoms, so a person may not know they have syphilis, or they may find a hard, painless sore near the point of [contact] or develop a rash, swelling of the glands, hair loss, or fatigue. A person can contract syphilis through oral, vaginal, and anal sex or close skin-to-skin [contact] with a syphilis lesion or rash.

[The news report above says that there was a 33% increase in syphilis (presumably the primary and secondary (P&S) stages of syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease, although the specific stage being reported is not mentioned) in 2018 compared to 2017 in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Many of those infections occurred in men who have sex with men, but there has also been an increase in cases in women. We are not told if there is an increase in the incidence of congenital syphilis, which frequently is associated with an increase of syphilis in women, and no further information is provided on the epidemiology of this outbreak.

ProMED-mail recently posted reports of an increase in P&S syphilis in the Canadian province of Alberta, associated with 22 cases of congenital syphilis, as well as syphilis outbreaks in the Northwestern subregion of the Canadian province of Ontario, and in Winnipeg, the capital city of the Canadian province of Manitoba, where it was attributed to the rise in injecting drug (methamphetamine) use. Transmission of syphilis in injection drug users may occur as a consequence of sharing a needle/syringe contaminated with infected blood from somebody who has primary or secondary syphilis (https://www.kpbs.org/news/2010/apr/28/new-ucsd-study-suggests-needle-sharing-may-spread-/), but more likely the infection is acquired by sexual contact as a consequence of exchanging drugs for sex and high-risk sexual behaviors, such as multiple partners and inconsistent condom use (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9147154 and https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6806a4.htm).

British Columbia, with an estimated population of 5 million residents in 2019, is the westernmost province of Canada, located between the Pacific Ocean and the Rocky Mountains (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia); its largest city is Vancouver, the 3rd-largest metropolitan area in Canada and the largest in western Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia).

More information on the epidemiology of syphilis in British Columbia would be welcomed from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
