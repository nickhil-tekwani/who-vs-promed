Second Death Linked To Ship
---------------------------
A second passenger on a cruise ship now being used as a floating hotel for
Olympic broadcasters reportedly has died from complications arising from a
flu-like illness he contracted while on board the holiday liner.
[The 62-year-old man] died Wednesday, 3 days after returning from a 12-day
South Pacific cruise on the Fair Princess, the Daily Telegraph reported
Monday (Sunday EDT).
[His] death and reports of similar outbreaks on two other cruises have
raised concerns about the ship, which is now home to 400 broadcasters
working for the Sydney Olympic Broadcasters Organization.
On Sunday, Andrew Wilson, chief health officer for New South Wales state,
told heads of delegations on the ship that the vessel was free from
legionnaire's disease, which was first thought to be the source of the
problem.
[The dead man] was one of dozens who fell ill during the trip, with 4
hospitalized in Noumea, New Caledonia. A Brisbane man who died was also
reported to be suffering from the mystery illness.
