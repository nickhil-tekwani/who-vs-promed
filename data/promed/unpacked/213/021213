[1] Vaccines: Johnson & Johnson
Date: Thu 1 Apr 2021 15:15 EDT

Johnson & Johnson vaccine was contaminated by ingredients from another company's vaccine at a manufacturing plant in Baltimore [Maryland, USA], federal officials confirmed Wednesday [31 Mar 2021], ruining a batch of raw vaccine representing millions of doses and prompting a review. However, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement it was still on track to deliver the 20 million doses it promised the federal government by Wednesday [31 Mar 2021] and was on track to deliver another 24 million doses by the end of April [2021].

The mixing of ingredients for coronavirus vaccines for Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca occurred at a plant operated by Emergent, which has not yet been certified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to produce Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Emergent is a contract manufacturer for bulk vaccine substance for both Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. It also has federal agreements for production of medicines to combat bioterror threats. Emergent did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday [31 Mar 2021].

Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was granted emergency use authorization by the FDA in February [2021]. AstraZeneca, after a number of clinical trial problems, has not yet been authorized in the United States.

None of the contaminated vaccine made it out of the plant, a federal official said. It had not reached the "fill-and-finish" stage of production, which involves final formulation and filling vials after bulk vaccine is shipped to a Catalent plant in Indiana. "We are going to make sure that we understand what happened," said a health official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the situation. "We have to work through and find out what is going on."

Johnson & Johnson provided no details in a statement but said it was beefing up staff and oversight of vaccine manufacturing at the plant. It has been shipping raw ingredients from Europe pending certification of the Emergent facility. "Johnson & Johnson is providing additional experts in manufacturing, technical operations and quality to be on-site at Emergent to supervise, direct and support all manufacturing of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine," the company said in a statement.

The New York Times first reported the incident [see https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-mixup.html]. It said about 15 million doses worth of bulk vaccine were ruined and said it was attributed to human error. Johnson & Johnson did not confirm the estimate of volume that was ruined. But at Johnson & Johnson's USD 10-a-dose price for the finished product, the value would be up to USD 150 million.

A federal official said the cross-contamination was caught on routine quality control checks by Johnson & Johnson. "The issue is whether manufacturing processes at the plant are suboptimal," said the official. "Nothing got out of the plant." The discovery was made a few days ago, setting off a flurry of meetings involving the FDA, Johnson & Johnson, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority in the Department of Health and Human Services.

["The mistake is a major embarrassment both for Johnson & Johnson, whose one-dose vaccine has been credited with speeding up the national immunization program, and for Emergent, its subcontractor, which has faced fierce criticism for its heavy lobbying for federal contracts, especially for the government's emergency health stockpile.

"...The problems arose in a new plant that the federal government enlisted last year (2020) to produce vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca. The 2 vaccines use the same technology employing a harmless version of a virus -- known as a vector -- that is transmitted into cells to make a protein that then stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies. But Johnson & Johnson's and AstraZeneca's vectors are biologically different and not interchangeable.

"In late February [2021], one or more workers somehow confused the 2 during the production process, raising questions about training and supervision" (from the NY Times article https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/31/world/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-mixup.html).

"One more reason to have several vaccines that are produced in different places. The more we have the more robust is our supply" (https://mobile.twitter.com/florian_krammer).]

Prior infection by seasonal coronaviruses, as assessed by serology, does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in children, France, April to June 2020. Euro Surveill. 2021; 26(13): pii=2001782. https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2021.26.13.2001782

Abstract
--------
Background: Children have a low rate of COVID-19 and secondary severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS) but present a high prevalence of symptomatic seasonal coronavirus infections.

Aim: We tested if prior infections by seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV) NL63, HKU1, 229E or OC43 as assessed by serology, provide cross-protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: We set a cross-sectional observational multicentric study in pauci- or asymptomatic children hospitalised in Paris during the 1st wave for reasons other than COVID (hospitalised children [HOS], n  =  739) plus children presenting with MIS (n  =  36). SARS-CoV-2 antibodies directed against the nucleoprotein (N) and S1 and S2 domains of the spike (S) proteins were monitored by an in-house luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay. We randomly selected 69 SARS-CoV-2-seropositive patients (including 15 with MIS) and 115 matched SARS-CoV-2-seronegative patients (controls [CTL]). We measured antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV as evidence for prior corresponding infections and assessed if SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of infection and levels of antibody responses were shaped by prior seasonal coronavirus infections.

Results: Prevalence of HCoV infections were similar in HOS, MIS and CTL groups. Antibody levels against HCoV were not significantly different in the 3 groups and were not related to the level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the HOS and MIS groups. SARS-CoV-2 antibody profiles were different between HOS and MIS children.

Conclusion: Prior infection by seasonal coronaviruses, as assessed by serology, does not interfere with SARS-CoV-2 infection and related MIS in children.

[Coronaviruses are a quite diverse group, and several are common causes of respiratory infections in humans. One hypothesis has been that pre-existing immunity to seasonal coronavirus might explain the relatively mild disease seen in most children. It has also been speculated that the hyperinflammation seen in some children might be a form of immune enhancement caused by cross-reactive coronavirus immunity. These ideas were not borne out by this study that failed to show any difference in SARS-CoV2 antibodies in children who were hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS and controls. - Mod.LM]

Racial and ethnic differences in intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were comparable across both healthcare workers (HCWs) and the general public in the San Francisco Bay area this winter [2020/2021], according to survey results published yesterday [30 Mar 2021] in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The survey, led by researchers from the University of California San Francisco and Stanford University, included 1803 HCWs from 3 large medical centers who volunteered for regular COVID-19 testing and 3161 randomly selected members of the general public in 6 San Francisco Bay area counties from 27 Nov 2020 to 15 Jan 2021. While more HCWs than their randomly sampled peers said they were likely to be vaccinated, racial and ethnic differences in planned uptake were similar among both groups.

Among the HCWs, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of planned vaccine receipt relative to White participants was 0.24 for Black participants, 0.50 for Latin American respondents, 0.37 for Asian participants, 0.28 for respondents of other races, and 0.49 for those of mixed race. Among the general population, the aOR relative to White respondents was 0.29 for respondents who were Black, 0.55 for Latin Americans, 0.57 for Asians, 0.62 for those of other races, and 0.65 for mixed-race respondents.

Black, Latin American, and Asian participants were significantly more likely than White respondents to cite reasons not to be vaccinated, expressing skepticism about vaccine effectiveness (aOR, 2.39 for Black, 2.04 for Latin American, and 1.85 for Asian respondents), low levels of trust in vaccine manufacturers (aOR, 3.08, 1.85, and 1.34, respectively), and concerns that the government rushed vaccine approval (aOR, 2.10, 1.68, and 1.81).

The authors said that intention to be vaccinated is a deliberative, dynamic process that must not distract from the importance of ensuring equitable vaccine access. "Special effort is required to reach historically marginalized populations," the researchers wrote. "Efforts must acknowledge a history of racism that has degraded the trustworthiness of health and medical science institutions among historically marginalized populations, undermined confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and perpetuated inequitable access to care."

"Surveys have demonstrated racial differences in the public's willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (1,2) but have not directly compared vaccine intentions among health workers and the general public (3). We investigated COVID-19 vaccine intentions among racially and ethnically diverse samples of health workers and the general population."

"Discussion: In this survey study including a diversity of racial/ethnic groups, occupational immersion in a health care setting did not offset disparities in COVID-19 vaccination intentions. We found that Asian individuals, multiracial individuals, and those of other races were more similar to Black and Latinx individuals than White individuals in their likeliness of vaccine uptake. Limitations of this study include that the sample was drawn from people sufficiently concerned about their risk of COVID-19 and trusting of research to volunteer for a study involving repeated COVID-19 testing and the survey not including additional domains, such as perceived access, that might influence reported likeliness of vaccine uptake. However, it is striking that even among individuals motivated to participate in a longitudinal COVID-19 testing study, there were racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19 vaccination intentions and concerns about the vaccine.

"Black, Latinx, Asian, and Native American communities have borne a disproportionate toll of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US (4); inequities in vaccination would compound these disparities. Our survey was fielded at the time of the 1st emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in the US. Vaccination rollout since then has revealed barriers to accessing vaccination among historically marginalized populations who are highly motivated to be vaccinated (5). Vaccination intentions must be understood as a deliberative and dynamic process; a focus on intentions must not distract from the importance of ensuring equitable access to vaccination (5). Special effort is required to reach historically marginalized populations, including those in health occupations, to support informed vaccination decision-making and facilitate access. Efforts must acknowledge a history of racism that has degraded the trustworthiness of health and medical science institutions among historically marginalized populations (6), undermined confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, and perpetuated inequitable access to care."

COVID has highlighted health inequities on a global scale and within each country. Lower income people are more at risk because of their jobs, their living conditions, and their pre-existing health problems. This is further exacerbated by a distrust of the establishment leading to vaccine hesitancy as well as lack of connections making vaccines more accessible to those who want them. The public health system must address these inequities if we are to be successful defeating COVID. - Mod.LK]

https://g1.globo.com/bemestar/coronavirus/noticia/2021/04/01/brasil-bate-marca-de-3-mil-mortos-por-covid-por-dia-na-media-movel-e-soma-3255-mil-obitos.ghtml


Brazil recorded 3673 deaths from COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, totaling this Thursday [1 Apr 2021] 325 559 deaths. With this, the moving average of deaths in the country in the last 7 days was above the 3000 mark for the 1st time and reached 3119. It's the worst number in the index for the 7th consecutive day. Compared to the average of 14 days ago, the variation was +43%, indicating an upward trend in deaths from the disease.

The numbers are in the new survey of the consortium of press vehicles on the situation of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, consolidated at 8 pm this Thursday [1 Apr 2021]. The balance is based on data from the state health departments.

There are already 71 days in a row with the moving average of deaths above the mark 1000; the country now completes 16 days with this average above 2000 dead per day, and this is the 6th day with the average above 2500.

See the sequence of last week [March 2021] in the moving average:

- Fri (26 Mar): 2400 (record)
- Sat (27 Mar): 2548 (record)
- Sun (28 Mar): 2598 (record)
- Mon (29 Mar): 2655 (record)
- Tue (30 Mar): 2728 (record)
- Wed (31 Mar): 2971 (record)
- Thu (1 Apr): 3119 (record)

In confirmed cases, since the beginning of the pandemic, 12 842 717 Brazilians have had or have the new coronavirus, with 89 459 of these confirmed on the last day. The moving average in the last 7 days was 73 993. This represents a variation of +2% in relation to the cases recorded in 2 weeks, which indicates a trend of stability in diagnostics.

The consortium also raised that 8 states had their worst day of pandemic until now, using as a parameter the evolution of the death rate for each of them: DF [District Federal], ES [Espirito Santo], MT [Mato Grosso], MG [Minas Gerais], RJ [Rio de Janeiro], RS [Rio Grande do Sul], SP [Sao Paulo] and TO [Tocantins].

Summary -- Brazil, 1 Apr 2021
- Total deaths: 325 559
- 24-hour death record: 3673
- Average new deaths in the last 7 days: 3119 (variation in 14 days: +43%)
- Total confirmed cases: 12 842 717
- Record of confirmed cases within 24 hours: 89 459
- Average new cases in the last 7 days: 73 993 per day (variation in 14 days: +2%)

States and number of deaths
- Going up (16 states and the Federal District): ES, MG, RJ, SP, DF, GO [Goias], MS [Mato Grosso do Sul], MT, AP [Amapa], RO [Rondonia], TO, AL [Alagoas], CE [Ceara], MA [Maranhao], PB [Paraiba], PE [Pernambuco] and PI [Piaui]
- Stable (7 states): PR [Parana], RS, SC [Santa Catarina], PA [Para], BA [Bahia], RN [Rio Grande do Norte] and SE [Sergipe]
- Falling (3 states): AC [Acre], AM [Amazonas] and RR [Roraima]
