State health officials on Monday [22 Oct 2012] said they had positively confirmed a case of hantavirus, contracted by a Long Island man bitten by a mouse while backpacking in the Adirondacks.

Earlier this month [October 2012], medical personnel said they were confident the illness was [due to a] hantavirus [infection] but were waiting for final confirmation from state laboratories, which had sent samples to the federal Centers for Disease Control. The results were confirmed on 17 Oct [2012].

As a precaution, workers with the state Department of Environmental Conservation will begin making sure there is no food or other rodent attractants in lean-tos in the Eastern High Peaks wilderness, where the case first emerged. The virus, which affects the lungs is typically contracted when people inhale dust or particles from rodent droppings.

The patient recovered, but hantavirus can be deadly. Health officials say they are now assuming that the virus may be carried by rodents anywhere in the state.

[The USA CDC Virus Viral Special Pathogens Branch (VSPB) confirmed this case as a hantavirus infection. Acute serum tested at the CDC laboratory confirmed the presence of antibodies to a New World hantavirus. Because the ELISA is cross-reactive, they do not know the exact virus species at this time.

ProMED-mail thanks the CDC VSPD for providing the information. The hantavirus in this New York case is likely to be either Monongahela or New York hantaviruses. Both can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), occur in New York state, and have the white-footed mouse, _Peromyscus leucopus_, as reservoir hosts.

A middle-aged Winnipeg man has died after contracting an infection due to [a] hantavirus [infection], a disease associated with the urine and feces of deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_].

The man's death was reported by the province on Friday [26 Oct 2012]. It is the 1st recorded fatality since 2000.

Officials said he caught the virus after sweeping up mouse droppings at a cottage.

Manitoba's medical officer of health confirmed the hantavirus link on Friday [26 Oct 2012].

"This time of year a lot of people are getting the flu so it's easy to miss hantavirus [infections]," Dr Richard Rusk said. "But there was a history of having been exposed to mice droppings."

Health officials are urging people to wear gloves and masks when working around or cleaning out areas where there may be mice.

The hantavirus infection, also known as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), is a very rare viral disease, which can be fatal. Early symptoms of hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough, which progresses to respiratory illness, the province said in a release. The symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after exposure to deer mouse droppings.

[Hantavirus infections have been reported in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. There is no indication in this report indicating which hantavirus is involved in this case. Both Sin Nombre and New York hantaviruses have deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) as reservoir hosts. The deer mouse is one of the most common and widely distributed mammals in North America.
