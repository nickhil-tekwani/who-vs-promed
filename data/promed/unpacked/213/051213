Suspected cases of [human] anthrax in Chama District in Eastern
Province have reached 278, from the 120 cases announced by the
Ministry of Health last week [week of 29 Aug 2011]

Eastern Province medical officer Kennedy Malama told Breeze FM Radio
monitored in Chipata yesterday [7 Sep 2011] that Chama had recorded 5
deaths of people directly linked to the disease, which had killed more
than 90 hippos in the district.

Dr Malama said the Ministry of Health had established that the
affected people contracted the disease through touching and eating
hippo meat. He cautioned Chama residents and those in surrounding
areas against consuming game meat, especially hippo to prevent the
spreading of the disease.

Dr Malama said medical personnel were on high alert and were attending
to people showing symptoms of anthrax. On Friday last week [2 Sep
2011], Ministry of Health spokesperson Reuben Mbewe said Chama had
recorded suspected cases of anthrax in more than 120 people.

Dr Mbewe said the outbreak was suspected to have been caused by an
infected hippo in Luangwa River. He said all the patients had a
history of having consumed or touched hippo meat. Dr Mbewe said the
hippo was said to have died of anthrax around the upstream of Luangwa
River.
