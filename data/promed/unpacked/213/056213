Tasmania is in the "peak phase" of the most devastating flu season in recent memory, Health Minister Michael Ferguson warned.

As of [12 Sep 2017], there were 2337 confirmed cases of influenza and 21 deaths since [1 Jan 2017]. Last year [2016], 14 people died, and only 969 influenza cases were reported.

Mr Michael Ferguson spoke about the outbreak on Sunday morning [17 Sep 2017] before running the Women's 5 km in Launceston. "My latest advice on the flu outbreak this year [2017] is that we're still at a very high level of confirmed cases of influenza A," he said. "Taking only into account those cases that have been confirmed by a medical test, we are at a 3-4 times higher rate of confirmed cases than in previous years, the last 5 years. It could be the most devastating; it could be the highest rate in many years."

Of the 2337 cases since [1 Jan 2017], 1357 were in the state's south, 651 in the north, 327 on the northwest, and 2 were overseas visitors.

With spring upon us, Mr Ferguson hoped the season would soon end. "It certainly looks like we're in the peak phase, and whether or not that's going to continue to grow or start to plateau and fall away, I simply don't know," he said.

Last week [week of 11 Sep 2017], Tasmania's director of public health, Mark Veitch, said cases appeared to be declining.

Mr Ferguson said this year's [2017] flu season had started earlier and that the number of cases had been much higher, putting pressure on workplaces, aged care homes, and hospitals.

"The numbers are immense, but the response from our team has been really fantastic," he added. "It's a big strain on our system, but I want to say thank you to all of our staff who have worked so hard to provide a strong and positive response."

But the devastating flu season has not been exclusive to Tasmania. This year [2017], the deadly strain of flu has killed 94 people in Victorian aged-care facilities. Across the country, case numbers have continued to climb, making 2017 one of the worst years for influenza in recent memory.

Dr Veitch said that while a high-coverage of flu vaccination among aged-care residents and staff was helpful, it was only one part of reducing outbreaks. "Staff and visitors can help by staying away if they have flu-like symptoms," he said.

[Earlier ProMED posts have also highlighted the increased intensity of the current influenza season in countries in southern hemisphere including Australia (Influenza (17): WHO global update, Australia (QL) 20170812.5237383). Every year, influenza epidemics can seriously affect all populations, but the highest risk of complications occurs among pregnant women, children aged 6 month-5 years, the elderly, individuals with specific chronic medical conditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, and chronic heart or lung diseases, and healthcare workers (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211/en/).

While influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent disease, antiviral drugs are available for treatment, though influenza viruses can develop resistance to the drugs. - Mod.UBA
