Disease devastates pomegranate crop
------------------------------------
Pomegranate cultivation is fast disappearing in Karnataka following
the rampant attack of bacterial blight disease (BBD) in all the
growing areas of the state. As a result of the spread of devastating
BBD, the state has witnessed almost 90 percent drop in the production
over the last few years. Farmers have uprooted trees in about 30
percent of the cultivated area due to continuous loss of crop over
the last 4 years.

The production of pomegranate has declined from a high of 1.8 lakh
[180 000] metric tonnes per annum 4 years ago to less than 10 000
metric tonnes in 2007-08, thereby causing a revenue loss of about INR
200 crore [crore = 10 million] (about USD 47 million) in Karnataka, S
V Hittalmani, additional director, fruits and floriculture,
department of horticulture, Government of Karnataka said.

The bacterial blight disease is caused by a bacterium called
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pv. _punicae_. The bacterium was first
noticed in select farms in Bellary district in the 1980s; it started
spreading rapidly in the early 2000s and took epidemic proportions in
the last 4 years. It has caused severe damage and destroyed 90
percent of the cultivated area in the districts of Bagalkot, Belgaum,
Bellary, Bijapur, Chitradurga, Gulbarga, Koppal, Raichur, and Tumkur.

The horticulture department has identified some of the varieties that
are susceptible to the disease such as Ruby, Bhagwa (Kesar), and
Mrudula Arakta. The bacteria primarily spreads through infested
planting material and secondly through cutting implements and wind to
other farms. It has also started affecting other crops like lemon in
some areas.

Hittalmani said despite several control measures, the horticulture
scientists have failed to control the disease. The National
Horticulture Mission (NHM) has even earmarked a special grant to
fight the disease and Karnataka has been given INR 23 crore [2.3
million] (about USD 5.4 million) for a period of 2 years. The NHM had
recommended adoption of good management practices (GMP) and fixed INR
50 000 (USD 1170) cost per hectare to fight the bacteria. While NHM
provided 50 percent of the cost, 25 percent was given by the state
government and the balance had to be borne by the farmer.

"The scientific community has to accept their defeat in controlling
BBD as there is hardly any measure left to control it. The only way
is to stop the fresh planting and go for a crop holiday for 10 years.
Remove every infected plant and start afresh once the bacteria are
removed completely," Hittalmani said. He said the department of
horticulture will soon recommend to the government of India and NHM
to declare an official crop holiday and removal of all infected trees
across the country. "We will raise this topic in all the forthcoming
national seminars and conferences and convince the scientific
community to spread the awareness about taking a crop holiday," he
said.

Karnataka is the 2nd largest producer of pomegranates after
Maharashtra, which grows about 6 lakh [600 000] metric tonnes in 93
000 hectares (230 000 acres). Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat are the next
big producers.

[Oily spot, also called bacterial blight or black spot disease of
pomegranate, is caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar
_punicae_. It affects all plant parts, but the main damage is
observed on fruits, which develop black spots and usually split
resulting in enormous yield losses. Greyish black, coalescing spots
are also found on the leaves, which eventually may drop off. Infected
stems develop cracking of nodes and girdling. They break off at the
point of infection leading to breakdown of branches. An infection
rate of up to 100 percent has been reported in some orchards.
Bacterial ooze is used for diagnostic tests.

The bacterium survives on the tree as well as on fallen plant debris.
High temperatures and low humidity favour the disease. The pathogen
is spread by infected plant material, mechanical means (including
insects, birds, and humans), wind-splashed rain, and through infected
cuttings. Disease management includes use of clean planting material,
phytosanitary cultivation techniques, and bacteriocidal sprays
containing antibiotics or copper. No commercially grown pomegranate
cultivar has been found to show any resistance to oily spot.

Another strain of the same species, _X. axonopodis_ pv. _citri_,
causes citrus canker, a disease that poses a serious economic threat
to citrus industries worldwide. Since the 2 pathovars are considered
to be specific to their indicated hosts, it is likely that pv.
_citri_ is also present in the area and the cause of the similar
disease reported above in lemon crops.

A loss of at least 60 percent of the pomegranate crop due to oily
spot in the state of Maharashtra, and for the whole country a 50
percent loss of fruit suitable for export have been reported (see
ProMED-mail posts listed below). No information is given on whether
these may be concurrent outbreaks in the 2 neighbouring states with
local spread of the pathogen, or whether the epidemic started in one
state and has spread from there. It would be vital to use clean
planting material for replacement and to adopt strict phytosanitary
measures to prevent reintroduction of the pathogen.

A 'lakh' is a unit in the Indian numbering system, widely used both
in official and in other contexts in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri
Lanka, and Pakistan. One 'lakh' is equal to a hundred thousand. A
hundred 'lakhs' make a 'crore' or 10 million.
