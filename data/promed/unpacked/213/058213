Health officials have confirmed an outbreak of [influenza H1N1 virus infection] at Edmonton's Misericordia Hospital. About a dozen staff and a handful of patients have come down with the flu, officials say.

Only about 20 per cent of staff at the hospital are immunized, a rate that medical officer of health Dr Chris Sykora called abysmal. Sykora urged people to get their flu shots to protect themselves and others who may be more vulnerable.

However, mass immunization clinics close at 4:30 pm today [20 Dec 2013] until [6 Jan 2014], though doctor offices and pharmacies will continue to offer the vaccine. Earlier this week [week of 20 Dec 2013], health officials in British Columbia advised young people to get a flu vaccine after determining that the H1N1 influenza strain had returned to become the predominant strain in that province this flu season [2013-2014]. The strain, initially called swine flu, circulated during a global pandemic in 2009.

[This hospital outbreak would have been preventable if there had been adequate acceptance of the current Northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. It is not justifiable at this stage to hypothesise an increased virulence of the newly appearing H1N1 seasonal influenza virus.

The closure of immunisation centres during the holiday period will not help to curtail the outbreak in Edmonton. - Mod.CP
