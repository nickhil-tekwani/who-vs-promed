The spread of ohia [_Metrosideros polymorpha_] wilt on Hawaii Island is much greater than originally feared. The wilt has spread to approximately 34 000 acres of ohia forest [including] new locations where ohia wilt, also known as rapid ohia death [ROD], appears to have taken hold. [This is] a good indicator that ROD is capable of handling a lot of environmental conditions.

Ohia forests are considered the primary habitat for countless plants, animals and invertebrates [and] also protect watersheds that provide agriculture and drinking water. ROD can kill between 50 and 90 per cent of trees in a heavily infested area.

The disease was 1st noticed around 2010. Four years later, the U.S. Department of Agriculture positively identified the cause of the disease as a new strain of the fungus _Ceratocystis fimbriata_, which has been known [in Hawaii] for decades as a pathogen of sweet potato.

Scientists think its rapid spread has been helped by people, vehicles, equipment, trees and products made from them. The state Board of Agriculture placed a quarantine on ohia, restricting all movement of trees and their products. Ultimately, scientists hope that by identifying what is spreading the fungus, they'll be able to mitigate its devastating impacts.

[_Ceratocystis fimbriata_ (Cf) is currently considered a fungal species complex. The different species/strains cause rots, wilts and cankers on many hosts, including important crop and forest species, but vary in host specificity. CF strains are soilborne and also spread by water, mechanical means (for example on cutting tools) and with planting material (cuttings, seedlings). Beetles have been reported as important vectors in some hosts.

Disease management of soil borne fungi may include phytosanitary measures, crop rotation and use of certified disease-free planting material. Fungicides are generally not very effective but may be helpful as treatments for seedlings or scions before planting. Genetic resistance is generally considered the best means of control.

Our sincere thanks go to D. Duffy for summarising the following information from ongoing ROD research (for more information and updates, see link below):

"So far, 2 Cf strains were found in ohia. Seven genes in each of 6 Cf strains (2 ohia, 2 taro, 1 syngonium [ornamental plant], 1 sweet potato) known in Hawaii were sequenced. Work is ongoing, but still no records of the ohia strains have been found anywhere in the world. Pathogenicity testing of the ohia strains on the other hosts have been completed, and results were negative. The origin of the ohia strains is unknown, but it looks like they are quite adaptable, making it less likely that any resistance in ohia could hold for long. Loss of the ohia would have profound effects on biodiversity."

Members of the C.f. complex were known to exist previously in Hawaii, for example causing black rot of sweet potato, but the known sweet potato strain has a narrow host range in the family Convolvulaceae. It would remain to be determined whether the new ohia strains may have resulted from mutations of local or newly introduced strains which led to a jump in host range.

_M. polymorpha_ belongs to the family of Myrtacea, which also includes crops like guava (_Psidium_ spp.) and species of _Syzygium_ (cloves, rose apple and other tree fruits), as well as eucalypts and other woody species of medicinal and environmental importance in different regions worldwide.
