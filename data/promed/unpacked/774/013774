Scientists Find Novel Way to Subvert Anthrax Germ
-----------------------------------------------
A mutated form of the toxin in the anthrax bacterium could be used to
make a fast-acting medicine for people exposed to biological weapons
using the deadly germ, as well as a new form of vaccine, scientists
said on Thursday. Harvard Medical School researchers tested whether
they could prevent infection using a form of anthrax containing a
mutation in a toxin produced by the bacterium. When the mutant form
was injected together with the normally lethal mix of anthrax toxin,
laboratory rats did not develop any symptoms of poisoning, according
to the study appearing in the journal Science. Rats infected with the
toxin without the mutant variation became moribund within 90 minutes.
Death is caused by the toxin produced by the bacteria.
A big worry is the possible release of anthrax by terrorists in an
urban setting. The Harvard team sought to prevent infection using
forms of the anthrax bacterium with a mutation in a toxin component
called protective antigen. The anthrax bacterium secretes 3 toxin
proteins into the bloodstream: protective antigen, lethal factor and
edema factor. These assemble on the outside surface of human cell
membranes. For symptoms to develop, lethal factor and edema factor
must move into the cell interior. Normally, 7 protective-antigen
molecules form a doughnut-shaped channel that allows the 2 other
proteins to cross the usually impenetrable cell membrane and enter the
cytoplasm, where they disrupt cell function. The mutants appeared to
block the formation of this channel.

[ProMED-mail does not normally report on drugs or vaccines that have
not yet reached the stage of human trials. However, I think this
demonstrates a very interesting approach with a sound theoretical
background. Those who have access to Science on the web can read the
full article. - Mod.MHJ
