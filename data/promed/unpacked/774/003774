A monkey was found dead in the jurisdiction of Valpoi municipality on [Sun 21 Feb 2016], triggering panic among the people over Kyasanur forest disease [KFD], which has claimed 6 lives in the last 2 years.

The people have expressed fear of KFD or 'monkey fever' spreading from remote villages likes Mauxi and Pali to Valpoi. "We are afraid. This area has been seeing the emergence of a large number of monkeys for the last few days. This particular death of a monkey should be taken seriously by government agencies," said a resident of Ward 7 of Valpoi town.

More than 80 people have been diagnosed with KFD in Sattari taluka [sub district] since December 2015.

The anxious people rushed to see the dead monkey at a house. The house owner called up the KFD control room set up at the mamlatdar [MLA, officer in executive charge of a taluka] office Valpoi, apprising it of the incident. Mamlatdar Dashrath Gawas immediately sent a police team to the site. Later, a forest guard and a few workers of the forest department took away the dead monkey from the site. It must be noted here that excluding wearing of gloves no other precautionary measures were taken by these workers while shifting the dead monkey, which may have been infected by KFD virus.

Around 13 monkey carcasses had been found in Sattari taluka, out of which samples of 3 carcasses were sent for testing to Manipal [Karnataka]. It is learnt that all 3 samples have tested positive to KFD virus.

Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane said that it was really sad that the epidemic, which had been confined to rural areas, has now spread to Valpoi.

Assuring his intervention in this matter on priority, former health minister Rane said, "I will take up this issue very seriously, and if required we will come on the road."

[The Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) cases that occurred in Goa in 2015 are continuing into 2016. The previous cases were reported in December 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151228.3896626) and January 2016. It is likely that this monkey died of a KFD virus infection as well.

As noted in the previous posts, KFD virus infections can be serious. After 1-2 weeks of symptoms including diarrhea, some KFD patients recover without complication. However, the illness is biphasic for a subset of patients (10-20 per cent), who experience a 2nd wave of symptoms at the beginning of the 3rd week. These symptoms include fever and neurological manifestations, such as severe headache, mental disturbances, tremors, and vision deficits. The estimated case fatality rate is 3-5 per cent (see the CDC fact sheet at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/symptoms/index.html).

Monkeys are the reservoir host of KFD virus. Although the virus has been isolated from 16 species of ticks, _Haemaphysalis spinigera_ is the major vector. Most human cases occur during the dry season. KFD virus is a member of the _Flaviviridae_ family. Although monitoring ticks for KFD virus provides information for issuing alerts, the only means for prevention of infection is avoidance of tick bites.

Additional information is available from the CDC fact sheet (see http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/Fact_Sheets/KyasanurForestDis.pdf).
