Cases of Aujeszky's disease in hunting dogs have been reported in the Hautes-Pyrenees department, more particularly in the Magnoac sector, announces the federation of hunters in Occitanie.

Aujeszky's disease, or "pseudo-rabies," is an infectious disease of pigs, of viral origin. In dogs, it is responsible for encephalomyelitis; the outcome is always fatal.

The infection of the dog is caused in particular by the ingestion of viscera of wild boar contaminated by the virus or during close contact with wild boars carrying this virus. It is therefore necessary to avoid contact between dogs and wild boars as much as possible. At the end of the hunt, it is strongly advised not to feed hunting dogs with wild boar tissues. Nor should venison waste be left in the wild.

This disease is not a zoonosis. It is not transmissible to humans, neither by contact, nor by the consumption of venison.

The incubation of the disease in dogs is short, i.e., less than a week. The behavior of the dog changes quickly: it can appear depressed and, at times, aggressive. These changes may be reminiscent of rabies, hence the name "pseudo-rabies" given to this disease. Severe itching, or pruritus, then appears in the dog. [These spots] are often located in the head and sometimes lead to self-harm.

If in doubt, it is advisable to contact your veterinarian promptly after isolating the dog. There is now a possibility of vaccinating dogs by contacting your veterinarian. There would be some side effects (reaction at the injection site). Trials are currently being applied in order to establish a vaccination protocol for dogs (dose and number of injections).

[Aujeszky's disease (AD), also known as pseudorabies, is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1 (SHV-1), a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae and the family Herpesviridae. The virus infects the central nervous system and other organs, such as the respiratory tract, of a variety of mammals. On top of pigs, the natural host, other animals such as dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, rabbits, foxes, minks, etc. can be infected. Humans and tailless apes are not susceptible. It is associated primarily with pigs, which remain latently infected following clinical recovery (except piglets under 2 weeks of age, which die from encephalitis). In consequence, the pig is the only species able to survive a productive infection and, therefore, serves as the reservoir host. The disease is not zoonotic.

AD is endemic in many parts of the world, but several countries have successfully completed eradication programmes, e.g., the United States of America, Canada, New Zealand, and many Member States of the European Union.

The disease is controlled by containment of infected herds and by the use of vaccines or removal of latently infected animals. Stamping out has been or is used in several countries, usually when the infected farms are small or when the threat to neighbouring farms is very high in free countries.

Aujeszky's disease is an OIE-listed disease; the above and additional information on the disease and its diagnosis and control are included in OIE's Terrestrial Manual (2018 update) at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.02_AUJESZKYS.pdf.
