Warning of an outbreak of bovine rabies in Sierra Norte de Puebla
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hugo Lopez Martinez, president of the Promotion and Development of
Human Rights organization, said Monday night [3 Aug 2009] that there
is an outbreak of bovine rabies in the vicinity of the Junta Auxiliar
[administrative division] San Agustin Atlihuacan and the community of
Cuahueyatla, which should focus the attention of the authorities in
order to prevent rabies from spreading to other animals or to humans.

During an interview, an associate of this organization, who so far
has lost 15 cattle that suddenly died in his pasture, reported that
the problem appeared this year [2009] with considerable mortality of
cattle in his ranch, which has increased over the last months. The
animals present with symptoms similar or identical to those of bovine
paralytic rabies. He discussed the situation with other members of
the organization and consulted with a local veterinarian. A study was
carried out through the department of the Secretariat for
Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries, and Food Supply
(SAGARPA) that handles the capture of bats, and bovine paralytic
rabies was confirmed in his property after analysis of the brain of a
dead bovine sent to the secretariat's animal disease laboratory
resulted positive for the disease.

The cattle rancher further commented that all his neighbors and other
cattle ranchers in the areas of San Agustin and the community of
Cuahueyatla (one of whom apparently sent a sample from a dead animal
for analysis, which also resulted positive for rabies) are reporting
the same problem with their cattle. The animals die overnight, or
sometimes die after 3-4 days, of a kind of paralysis. Judging by the
symptoms, they believe it is bovine paralytic rabies [this is likely
from vampire bats. - Mod.TG] even though, in his case, only one dead
animal was sent to SAGARPA's animal disease laboratory.

The members of the association consider that there is a risk that
this outbreak will spread to other parts of the region and are
concerned that it also may spread to other animals or humans.

When asked whether these [vampire] bats have been attacking cattle,
chickens and pigs, the rancher responded affirmatively, but added
that it hasn't been possible to trap any of the bats. However,
although the results of tests for rabies were positive, they hadn't
found any bites on the animals, as is normally seen in other
pastures, so they don't really know the cause. A rancher commented
that there is an animal, apparently a dog, that chases the cattle at
night but they don't know the provenance or anything else about this
animal. The cattle owners are requesting through a local veterinarian
that authorities determine whether the rabies [virus] is being
transmitted by [vampire] bats or a dog.

The rancher concluded the interview by urging everyone to think about
the problems that may arise and affect everyone. The economy can be
affected through the loss of animals and they are asking the
government to extend its support to local ranchers. They also urge
livestock producers to take preventive measures to avoid more cattle
deaths. Finally, they request the support of the health sector to
vaccinate exposed people or to implement preventive vaccination
against rabies in cattle.

Dr Israel Carrasco Lechuga MVZ, the veterinarian who was consulted
originally, narrated the events and added that a follow-up and
surveillance campaign had been undertaken to determine the status of
vaccination of the bovines in the area [apparently vaccination
coverage was not adequate. - Sr.Tech.Ed.MJ]. Last week [week of 27
Jul 2009], representatives from Puebla traveled to the area to
implement a vaccination campaign, but many people did not vaccinate
their animals, either because they were reluctant to do so, or
because they were not informed of the vaccination campaign. Carrasco
Lechuga noted that they will continue to monitor the situation.

The Promotion and Development of Human Rights organization is trying
to anticipate and prevent the disease from spreading, informing
livestock producers of the situation and urging them to have their
animals vaccinated. Each vaccine has a cost of 4 pesos [USD 0.30]
--practically free -- if administered by personnel from state
institutions in Puebla, and is available in veterinary pharmacies or
the Regional Livestock Union.

Carrasco Lechuga, also commented that once the cattle are vaccinated,
the animal can be sold and be ready for consumption in 15 days.
However, there may be unscrupulous people who buy the sick cattle at
a very low cost, which would place people at risk because they could
contract rabies. The Promotion and Development of Human Rights
organization requests that the slaughter of animals be supervised
more energetically to avoid unnecessary risks.

[Rabies is an acute viral encephalomyelitis that principally affects
carnivores and bats, although it can affect any mammal. It is
invariably fatal once clinical signs appear. Rabies is found
throughout the world, but a few countries claim to be free of the
disease due either to successful elimination programs and/or to their
island status and enforcement of rigorous quarantine regulations.

Rabies is caused by lyssaviruses in the _Rhabdoviridae_ family.
Lyssaviruses are usually confined to one major reservoir species in a
given geographic area, although spillover to other species is common.
Identification of different virus variants by laboratory procedures
such as monoclonal antibody analysis or genetic sequencing has
greatly enhanced understanding of rabies epidemiology. Generally,
each virus variant is responsible for rabies transmission between
members of the same species in a given geographic area. From an
epidemiologic perspective, it is preferable to use the name of the
species acting as the reservoir as an adjective: rabies maintained by
dog-to-dog transmission is termed canine rabies, whereas rabies in a
dog as a result of infection with a variant from a different
reservoir, such as, skunk (or fox), should be referred to as skunk
(or fox, etc.) rabies in a dog.

In this case it is likely from vampire bats, which feed at night,
generally around the coronary bands of the hooves or on the tail, so
that marks are very difficult to find. Some bats have been known to
feed off of the back of animals when they lay down. If there is a
disturbance in the forest, such as deforestation, it may be forcing
the bats out of a normal habitat and into other regions where there
are alternative feed sources, such as livestock.

Transmission is almost always by introduction of virus-laden saliva
into the tissues, usually by the bite of a rabid animal. Although
much less likely, it is possible for virus from saliva, salivary
glands, or brain to cause infection by entering the body through
other fresh wounds or through intact mucous membranes. Usually,
saliva is infectious at the time that clinical signs occur, but it is
possible for dogs and cats to shed virus for several days before
onset of clinical signs.

Clinical signs of rabies are rarely definitive. Rabid animals of all
species usually exhibit typical signs of CNS (central nervous system)
disturbance, with minor variations among species. The most reliable
signs, regardless of species, are acute behavioral changes and
unexplained progressive paralysis. Behavioral changes may include
sudden anorexia, signs of apprehension or nervousness, irritability,
and hyperexcitability (including priapism). The animal may seek
solitude. Ataxia, altered phonation, and changes in temperament are
apparent. Uncharacteristic aggressiveness may develop -- a normally
docile animal may suddenly become vicious. Commonly, rabid wild
animals may lose their fear of humans, and species that are normally
nocturnal may be seen wandering about during the daytime.

The paralytic form of rabies is 1st manifested by paralysis of the
throat and masseter muscles, often with profuse salivation and
inability to swallow. Dropping of the lower jaw is common in dogs.
Owners frequently examine the mouth of dogs and livestock searching
for a foreign body or administer medication with their bare hands,
thereby exposing themselves to rabies. These animals may not be
vicious and rarely attempt to bite. The paralysis progresses rapidly
to all parts of the body, and coma and death follow in a few hours.
This latter is very much what seems to be happening with the
livestock described above.

There are vaccines for livestock that are preventatives, not cures.
The vaccine needs to be administered prior to the bites. If these are
from vampire bats then people should be especially wary as bats can
come into a home and will often feed on the feet, especially the
large toe, without awaking its victims. Closing the house at night,
or putting screens on windows will help reduce these incidents.

There is no treatment for rabies affected animals. The treatment for
humans is successful in a rare few as the disease is almost always
fatal in humans as well.
