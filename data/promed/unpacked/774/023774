[The country of Mongolia is divided into 21 provinces (Mongolian: 'aimag') and the capital (niislel) Ulaanbaatar. Secondary subdivisions outside Ulaanbaatar are called "sum" (often transcribed as soum). Sums are further subdivided into baghs. While sums always have a permanent settlement as administrative centers, many baghs don't. For a map presenting the Burentogtokh soum, please refer to https://mongolia-guide.com/destination/khuvsgul/burentogtokh.

The continuing FMD (serotype O) epizootic in Mongolia started (recurred) on 6 Aug 2021, confirmed on 9 Aug 2021, reported to the OIE 7 Sep 2021. According to the media, citing Mongolia's General Authority for Veterinary Services, as of mid October 2021, more than half of Mongolia's 21 provinces had been infected (20211006.8698879). The identification of the disease in Khuvsgul testifies to a further spread of the virus.

According to Mongolia's page on the WRLFMD (FAO World Reference Laboratory for Foot-and-Mouth Disease) website, sequences for genotyping were received from Mongolia at Pirbright on 9 Aug 2021. According to the WRL report, the virus has been identified as FMDV serotype O, topotype 'ME-SA,' lineage 'Ind-2001', sublineage 'e'. A similar virus was identified in samples from Mongolia during 2018 and 2019. The detailed report is available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2021-00012-MOG-GTR-O-O_001.pdf.

The matching strain differentiation report of 3 vaccines to the strains circulating in Mongolia during 2018 is available at https://www.wrlfmd.org/sites/world/files/quick_media/WRLFMD-2019-00003-MON-VMR-O-O_001.pdf. - Mod.AS
