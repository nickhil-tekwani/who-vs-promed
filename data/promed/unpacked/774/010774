RE: Vesicular Stomatitis in Tabasco, Mexico
-------------------------------------------
[The following is some information from Dr. Fragoso, Director General
de Salud Animal, SENASICA which he suggested we might share more
widely (e.g., ProMED)]

"The Mexico - U.S. Exotic Animal Disease Commission (EADC) has
reported some cases of vesicular stomatitis in the State of Tabasco in
Mexico. In the past few weeks the EADC has been detecting cases of
vesicular stomatitis serotype New Jersey in cattle, and has also
tested for foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), and other vesicular diseases
of cattle showing negative results. These cases were detected by the
permanent surveillance system in Mexico in those areas and was
reported by farm owners to the local and federal animal health
authorities.

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects cattle,
horses, and swine and occasionally small ruminants. Vesicular
stomatitis has been confirmed only in the Western Hemisphere. It is
known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North,
Central, and South America, but outbreaks of the disease in other
temperate geographic parts of the Hemisphere occur sporadically. While
vesicular stomatitis does not generally cause animals to die, it can
still cause economic losses to livestock producers. The disease is
particularly significant because its outward signs are similar to
those of foot-and-mouth disease. The only way to tell these diseases
apart is through laboratory tests. Mexico has been free of FMD since
December 1954.

Some newspapers have erroneously reported this incident as an outbreak
of FMD, but the Mexican authorities have worked to clarify this
issue."

[We have been requested by APHIS to post this 2nd communication as it
was felt that the 1st was a mite too fast. Additional information is
that it was VS New Jersey strain, a not uncommon strain of this
virus.

As a moderator with some experience of FMD I must point out that
erroneous information on FMD outbreaks has to be countered as quickly
and reliably as possible to prevent negative impacts. This we did. -
