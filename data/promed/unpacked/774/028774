[According to OIE's data for 2014 (July-December 2014 distribution map), _B. abortus_ was present in Botswana's neighbours Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, while _B. melitensis_ was reportedly present during the same period in Namibia only (see http://tinyurl.com/ntkqdgz and http://tinyurl.com/pczaort).

Given the occurrence of _B. abortus_ in this area, this event might be likely due to this disease. However, certain points mentioned in the report do need to be clarified to better understand this event.

Some clarity is needed regarding the species of _Brucella_ which caused the disease. The heading of the report states that the agent is _Brucella abortus_, but the causative agent description is limited to just _Brucella_ spp. The report also indicates that advanced diagnostic methods were utilized. However, for this event, only the rose bengal test was used, which is a screening test, and any positive results would need to be verified with confirmatory tests. Furthermore, one of the outbreaks is reported as occurring in caprines, a species not normally affected by _B. abortus_. Therefore, it would be useful to have additional information on the types of confirmatory tests that were conducted, and on the outcome of the epidemiological investigation.

As the OIE Terrestrial Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines indicates: "Presumptive evidence of _Brucella_ is provided by the demonstration, by modified acid-fast staining of organisms, of _Brucella_ morphology in abortion material or vaginal discharge, especially if supported by serological tests. The polymerase chain reaction methods provide additional means of detection. Whenever possible, _Brucella_ spp. should be isolated using plain or selective media by culture from uterine discharges, aborted fetuses, udder secretions or selected tissues, such as lymph nodes and male and female reproductive organs. Species and biovars should be identified by phage lysis, and by cultural, biochemical and serological criteria. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can provide both a complementary and biotyping method based on specific genomic sequences.

"The buffered _Brucella_ antigen tests, i.e. rose bengal test and buffered plate agglutination test, the complement fixation test, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or the fluorescence polarisation assay, are suitable tests for screening herds and individual animals. However, no single serological test is appropriate in each and all epidemiological situations. Therefore, the reactivity of samples that are positive in screening tests should be assessed using an established confirmatory and/or complementary strategy. The indirect ELISA or milk ring test performed on bulk milk samples are effective for screening and monitoring dairy cattle for brucellosis, but the milk ring test is less reliable in large herds."

It is worth noting that in 2007 Botswana reported 4 outbreaks of brucellosis in cattle that were caused by _Brucella melitensis_ (see Botswana annual report 2007 at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2007&semester=0&wild=0&country=BWA&this_country_code=BWA&detailed=1; Note: see Sections 1 and 3 of the report).

Based on the OIE Manual:

- "Bovine brucellosis is usually caused by _Brucella abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. Infection is widespread globally. Several countries in Northern and Central Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand are believed to be free from the agent." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf

- "Brucellosis in sheep and goats (excluding _Brucella ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Sporadic infections caused by _B. abortus_ or _B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are rare." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.07.02_CAPRINE_OVINE_BRUC.pdf

Another point of confusion lies in the fact that Botswana reports as manifestation of the disease "sub-clinical infection"; however, in the epidemiological section, they report the animals as having aborted, which is one of the signs of the disease, and which prompts investigators to always consider _Brucella_ spp. as the causative organism. As the OIE Manual also states: "Clinically, the disease is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf

Finally, it would be important to learn if modified stamping out was or will be used as a control measure given that this disease is highly pathogenic for humans.

"_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and all infected tissues, cultures and potentially contaminated materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions." http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.03_BOVINE_BRUCELL.pdf. - Mods.CRD/AS]
