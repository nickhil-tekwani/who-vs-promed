Hantavirus Immunization in China
---------------------------------
Recent discussions about the Hantavirus situation in China have prompted at
least one "expat" clinic in Beijing to recommend "... that all travelers or
workers in this area [Chongqing receive the [Hantavirus vaccination."
This prompted a colleague in Thailand to ask me about recommendations for
Americans living in Beijing. The questions were passed to the Embassy
physician in Beijing who passed them up the line to Washington.
In response, the U.S. Department of State Office of Overseas Medical
Services, after consultations with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, has advised the Embassy as follows with regard to Hantavirus
risk and prevention in China. "Apart from military cases in Korea, there
have been very few if any expatriates with symptomatic infection. The risk
to China-based personnel and other travelers should be extremely [low.
Avoidance of rat-infested areas is most important. Neither the Chinese nor
Korean Hantavirus vaccines are approved in other countries. The U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are recommending against the use
of these unproven vaccines. The Office of Overseas Medical Services does
not agree with the vaccination recommendation recently sent out by an
expat-oriented medical services provider in China, on the basis that the
minimal risk of infection does not warrant the use of an incompletely
tested and non-approved vaccine."
These become, then, the official recommendations for American citizens
living and working in China. They do not attempt to address the question of
immunization recommendations for Chinese residents in the area near
Chongqing, who are clearly at higher risk of exposure. The situation will
be reevaluated [in the light of any new information.
