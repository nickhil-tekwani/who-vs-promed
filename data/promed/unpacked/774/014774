The Iraq Infection
-------------------
Military doctors are fighting to contain an outbreak of a potentially
deadly drug-resistant bacteria that apparently originated in the
Iraqi soil. So far, at least 280 people, mostly soldiers returning
from the battlefield, have been infected, a number of whom contracted
the illness while in USA military hospitals.
Most of the victims are relatively young troops who were injured by
the land mines, mortars and suicide bombs that have permeated the
Iraq conflict. No active-duty soldiers have died from the infections,
but 5 extremely sick patients, who were in the same hospitals as the
injured soldiers, have died after being infected with the bacteria,
_Acinetobacter baumannii_.
"This [is] a very large outbreak," says Arjun Srinivasan, a
lieutenant commander in the USA Public Health Service and a medical
epidemiologist at the CDC.
_Acinetobacter_ was the 2nd most prevalent infection for soldiers in
Viet Nam, but the military did not expect to see it as part of
Operation Iraqi Freedom. Researchers are still working to understand
where it came from and how patients were infected.
Doctors worry not only about soldiers who are already infected but
also those who are carrying _Acinetobacter_ on their skin, even
though they themselves are not infected. Lt Cmdr Kyle Petersen, an
infectious disease specialist at National Naval Medical Center (NNMC)
in Bethesda, MD, USA, says his hospital treated 396 patients who had
been wounded in Iraq between May 2003 and Feb 2005. About 10 percent
were infected, and another 20 percent were found to have
_Acinetobacter_ bacteria on their skin but were not infected. The
rate of appearance of the bacteria has "been flat-out steady," says
Petersen.
The same has been true at Army hospitals that include Walter Reed
Medical Center in Washington, DC, Tripler Medical Center in Hawaii
and Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, TX, where there has
been a total of about 240 cases of patients infected, while another
500 have carried the bacteria, according to Col. Bruno Petrucelli,
director of epidemiology and disease surveillance for the US Army
Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine.
Petrucelli says the 5 patients who died were at Army hospitals, most
of them at Walter Reed. They were already suffering from serious
health problems before they contracted the bacteria. "These were the
sickest of the sick," says Petrucelli. The infections are split
evenly among wound infections, respiratory infections and a mix of
bloodstream and other infections.
Preventing the bacteria's spread has required doctors to take extreme
care, putting all patients who are returning from the theater of war
into isolation. "It's one of those pathogens that once it gets into a
population and a chain of care, it can set up shop. Trying to contain
the spread of this infection to other people is very difficult," says
Andrew Shorr, a doctor who recently left Walter Reed for Washington
Hospital Center. "What has happened over the past 18 months is every
patient who shows up, we assume they're positive until they are
demonstrated negative."
