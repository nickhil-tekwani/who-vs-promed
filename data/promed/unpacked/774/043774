Multistate outbreaks of human _Salmonella_ infections linked to live poultry in backyard flocks, 2017
-------------------------------
Since the last update on 1 Jun 2017, 418 more ill people have been reported. The most recent illness began on 20 Jun 2017. CDC, multiple states, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are investigating 10 separate multistate outbreaks of salmonellosis in people who had contact with live poultry in backyard flocks.

These outbreaks are caused by several DNA fingerprints of different _Salmonella_ bacteria: _Salmonella_ Braenderup, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Hadar, _S._ I 4,[5],12:i-, _S._ Indiana, _S._ Infantis, _S._ Litchfield, _S._ Mbandaka, _S._ Muenchen, and _S._ Typhimurium. The outbreak strains of _Salmonella_ have infected a reported 790 people in 48 states and the District of Columbia. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 4 Jan 2017 to 20 Jun 2017. Of 580 people with available information, 174 ill people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings link the 10 outbreaks to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, from multiple hatcheries. In interviews, 409 (74 percent) of 553 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started. Contact with live poultry or their environment can make people sick with salmonellosis. Live poultry can be carrying _Salmonella_ bacteria but appear healthy and clean, with no sign of illness.

The number of people infected this year [2017] by _Salmonella_ from contact with so-called backyard poultry flocks has more than doubled since [1 Jun 2017], with 790 victims now confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Almost 1/3rd of the victims, 31 percent, are children younger than 5 years old.

Virginia had the most confirmed cases, 52, of _Salmonella_ infections linked to backyard flocks as of [7 Jul 2017]. Ohio was 2nd with 45 cases, and California was 3rd with 42 confirmed cases [see excellent map courtesy of CDC.] "In interviews, 409 (or 74 percent) of 553 ill people reported contact with live poultry in the week before illness started," the CDC reported on [Thu 13 Jul 2017].

The federal agency is now tracking 10 separate outbreaks, up from 8 reported earlier, spanning 48 states and Washington D.C., according to the [Thu 13 Jul 2017] update. The CDC predicts the country is on track to surpass the 2016 total of 895 cases of _Salmonella_ infection linked to contact with backyard flocks. The implicated birds came from multiple hatcheries. No deaths have been reported, but another 103 people have required hospitalization since the CDC's initial [1 Jun 2017] public warning, bringing the total to at least 174 victims with symptoms so severe that they had to be admitted to hospitals. Information was available for only 580 of the victims, so there could have been even more hospitalizations.

Multiple state agencies and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are assisting the CDC with the outbreak investigations.

"Any live poultry can carry _Salmonella_ bacteria, even if they look healthy and clean. That's why it's important for anyone raising backyard poultry to take steps to avoid getting sick when handling and caring for birds," the CDC warned. As of [7 Jul 2017], the CDC had confirmed 10 strains of _Salmonella_ bacteria in the outbreak investigations: _Salmonella_ Braenderup, _S._ Enteritidis, _S._ Hadar, _S._ I 4,[5],12:i-, _S._ Indiana, _S._ Infantis, _S._ Litchfield, _S._ Mbandaka, _S._ Muenchen, and _S._ Typhimurium.

Illness onset dates range from [4 Jan 2017] through [20 Jun 2017]. Lag time between illness onset and addition of victims to the outbreak count can be several weeks because of the time it takes for lab test results to be returned and then forwarded to state and federal officials. The outbreak numbers are expected to continue to increase for the next several months, according to the CDC, because people continue to purchase live poultry and continue to be exposed to Salmonella germs as they tend to backyard flocks.

"Regardless of where they are purchased, live poultry may have _Salmonella_ germs in their droppings and on their bodies, feathers, feet and beaks even when they appear healthy and clean. The germs can also get on cages, coops, hay, plants and soil in the area where the birds live and roam," the CDC reported.

The following safety tips are advised by the CDC, to avoid a _Salmonella_ infection while keeping poultry:
- Wash hands with soap and running water for a minimum of 20 seconds after handling live poultry;
- Do not allow children younger than 5 years to handle or touch live poultry and eggs without supervision;
- Never snuggle or kiss the birds or touch your face or mouth, and do not eat or drink while around live poultry.

More tips for how backyard flock owners can prevent infection can be found on the CDC website.

"Young children are more likely to get sick because their immune systems are still developing and they are more likely to put their fingers or pacifiers and other items into their mouths," according to the CDC website. Illness from _Salmonella_ infection usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. However, diarrhea may become so severe that the person needs to be hospitalized. "_Salmonella_ infections are more likely to be severe for children younger than 5 years, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems, such as people with cancer, diabetes, and liver or kidney disease," according to the CDC.

[Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle, and they carry salmonella. Two ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL]

[It has become fashionable in the US to have backyard poultry. So, this increase in human salmonellosis is not unexpected. From my personal professional epidemiological experience 50 years ago in the UK, such a rich variety of serotypes is typical of contaminated poultry feed. And with a significant suburban market for poultry feed, the quality will suffer. But the good news is that having your graduate students investigate such events is good shoe-leather experience for them, inexpensive, and they will see and learn a lot. - Mod.MHJ
