Zambia has recorded 4396 cases of typhoid since it broke out 3 months ago, with 9 deaths. Ministry of Health acting spokesperson Crispin Moyo said the country has experienced sporadic outbreaks of the waterborne disease in Kalabo, Mufurila, Nakonde and Lusaka.

Dr Moyo said in a statement yesterday, 4 Feb 2012, 13 cases are still undergoing treatment in Mufurila and 14 at Levy Mwanawasa General Hospital in Lusaka. He said the disease is an enteric fever caused by a bacterium called _Salmonella [enterica_] serotype Typhi and can be life-threatening.

[Typhoid fever is a classical systemic infection caused by the typhoid bacillus, _Salmonella enterica_ seroTYPE Typhi (commonly referred to as _S._ typhi), the most common cause of enteric fever, which also includes paratyphoid fever caused by _S. paratyphi_ A, B and C. These pathogens only infect humans. The disease is transmitted by ingestion of food, including dairy products, or water contaminated by excreta from patients or chronic carriers or handled by infected persons. Highest incidence usually occurs where water supplies serving large populations are contaminated by fecal matter, as existed at the end of the 19th century in many large cities in the USA and western Europe, when the disease was quite endemic in those areas. - Mod.LL]
