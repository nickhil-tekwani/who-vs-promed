----------------------------------------------------
There have been 137 cases of clinical West Nile virus (WNV) infection
detected in horses from 11 States.
The horses are from:

(Stonington, 1);

Sanderson, 1), Clay (Maxville, 2; Middleburg, 1), Duval (Jacksonville, 2),
Flagler (Bunnell, 1), Gadsden (Havana, 2; Quincy, 1; city not reported, 1),
Hamilton (Jennings, 1), Holmes (Bonifay, 1), Jefferson (Greenville, 2;

- 2 counties in Virginia: Madison (Brightwood, 1) and Rockingham (Dayton, 1).
At least 28 (20 percent) of the 137 horses died or were euthanatized. The
numbers of equine deaths associated with WNV infection by State are:
Connecticut, 1; Florida, 19; Georgia, 2; Louisiana, 1; Massachusetts, 1;
New Jersey, 1; New York, 2; and Virginia, 1.
Of the 137 horses, 135 were positive on a WNV IgM-capture enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (MAC-ELISA) and a WNV plaque reduction neutralization
test (PRNT) performed on serum at the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa. One of the other 2 horses had brain
tissue that tested positive at the NVSL on WNV reverse transcriptase-nested
polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR), had serum that was positive on WNV
PRNT, and had WNV isolated from brain tissue. An additional horse was
positive on WNV RT-nPCR on a virus isolate submitted to the NVSL for
confirmatory testing. Of the 135 serologically positive horses, 5 horses
from which brain tissues were submitted also tested positive on RT-nPCR
performed on those tissues. WNV was isolated at the NVSL from one of those
5 brain tissues as of 1 Oct 2001.

[The figure of 137 equine cases of West Nile virus infection given in this
USDA-APHIS update is considerably in excess of the figure given in the MMWR
Update to 2 Oct 2001 which was posted yesterday. It is likely that the
cumulative figures released by the various reporting agencies will not
correspond precisely until the outbreak finally subsides. - Mod.CP
