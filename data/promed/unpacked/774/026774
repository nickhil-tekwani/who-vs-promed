The moderator's report of 2 cases in New Mexico in 2018 is incorrect. See NMDoH Health Alert Network (HAN) Alert: "Issues with Commercially Available Hantavirus Rapid Antibody Testing and Increase in False Positives (https://nmhealth.org/publication/view/general/4742/).

The New Mexico Department of Health confirms the state's 1st hantavirus [infection] case of 2019. A 50-year-old woman from McKinley County was hospitalized and is now resting at home.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a severe respiratory illness caused by the Sin Nombre virus and can be deadly. HPS results in flu-like symptoms such as fever and muscle aches, which may be accompanied by chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough. HPS can be transmitted by breathing in the virus which can occur when urine or droppings containing the virus [from infected deer mice] are emitted into the air as mist or dust.

Hantavirus can also be transmitted by touching the eyes, nose or mouth after someone touches urine or droppings that contain the virus. The virus cannot be transmitted from person-to-person.

Deer mice are the main carriers of [Sin Nombre] hantavirus, and symptoms [in infected humans] can develop within 1-6 weeks after exposure to mice droppings and urine. To prevent the virus, NMDOH suggests avoiding contact with mice and other rodents.

While there is no cure for HPS, chances of recovery are best when an individual seeks medical attention early. According to The New Mexico Department of Health, in the past 10 years, there have been 37 cases of HPS in the state. 21 of those people survived the disease.

There were no cases in New Mexico in 2018 and five cases in 2017.

[Sin Nombre hantavirus is endemic in New Mexico, and a few cases have occurred there annually in recent years. The above report is incorrect in that there were 2 cases in 2018, a 27-year-old woman who died and a 9-year-old boy. Over the years, New Mexico has had a large proportion of the cases of Sin Nombre virus infections. The hantavirus involved in this current New Mexico case above and other cases in the western USA is Sin Nombre virus. Fatalities are due to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HPS). HPS can be very serious, and patients developing the symptoms should seek medical attention at the earliest possible time.

Infected rodents shed the virus in feces, urine and saliva. Individuals opening up cabins or storage areas that have been closed over winter or cleaning areas with signs of rodent presence should heed the precautions that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends in order to avoid exposure to the virus (https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/cleaning/index.html).

Deer mice, _Peromyscus maniculatus_, are the reservoir hosts of the Sin Nombre virus. An image of the deer mouse, _P. maniculatus_, can be seen at http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/media/images/mouse_f.jpg and in the report at the above URL. - Mod.TY
