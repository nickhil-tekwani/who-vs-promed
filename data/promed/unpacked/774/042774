Re: Undiagnosed livestock deaths - Afghanistan: request for information
-----------------------------------------------
Might this be an unexpected outbreak of _Coenurus Cerbralis_ (_Taenia
pisiformis_)? It is known to infest and manifest symptoms in cattle
as well as in sheep, and the symptoms can look quite alarming, what
with the circling, aggression, blindness and ataxia.
Other differentials not yet mentioned:
1. Toxic forage e.g. _Heliotropium spp._, _Cynoglossum spp._,
_Delphinium semibarbatum_, all native to Afghanistan and all avoided
by livestock except during extended drought.
2. Heavy metal toxicity. I couldn't find an accurate map of the area,
but indications on the internet of active mining in Badakhshan might
mean piles of tailings in agricultural areas.
3. "Louping ill" - tick-borne encephalitis of sheep.
Some of these are rather a reach; more information would be useful.

[Though PPR (Peste des petits ruminants) remains -- in line with
FAO's observation -- the main suspect, disease entities mentioned by
Dr. Baker deserve consideration, since the cited (ambiguous)
media-derived information indicated that cattle were the main species
affected while (irresponsibly?!) mentioning Mad-cow disease symptoms.
However, the inclusion of louping ill is debatable due to its
restricted geographic distribution. So far, this tick-borne viral
encephalitis, which affects mainly sheep, has been restricted to the
British isles; a closely related disease of sheep has been reported
from Norway, Bulgaria, Turkey, and the Basque region in Spain.
As indicated in the previous posting, staff of an FAO Regional Trust
Fund project focusing on disease surveillance will be following up in
Afghanistan in the near future. Their findings will be appreciated. -
