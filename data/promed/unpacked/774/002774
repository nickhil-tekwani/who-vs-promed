The New Mexico Department of Health is cooperating with the Texas Department of State Health Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on an investigation of 2 patients who are hospitalized in Texas with suspected botulism. The source is currently being investigated but is likely contaminated food. The patients are 2 adults from Lea County [New Mexico].

Botulism is a rare but potentially fatal illness caused by a nerve toxin that causes paralysis. All healthcare providers should consider botulism in patients presenting with the following signs and symptoms:
- double vision,
- blurred vision,
- drooping eyelids,
- slurred speech,
- difficulty swallowing,
- dry mouth,
- muscle weakness/descending paralysis, and
- difficulty breathing/shortness of breath

[No information is yet given regarding a potential source for these illnesses. Most cases of foodborne botulism are related to home canned or jarred foods but sometimes commercially prepared food can be implicated. Botulism can also be linked to traumatic wounds or injections of illicit drugs, especially black tar heroin.

Lea County, New Mexico is located in extreme southeastern New Mexico, both north and west of the state of Texas where the patients are hospitalized.
