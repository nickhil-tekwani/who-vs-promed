Chinese health authorities have reported 4 more H7N9 infections in 3 different areas of eastern China over the past 3 days, including the 1st detection in Shanghai since last April [2013]. Also, animal health officials in China have reported more positive H7N9 findings in environmental samples from a live poultry market, supporting the suspicion that such markets are fueling the outbreak in humans.

The patient from Shanghai is an 86-year-old man whose H7N9 illness was confirmed [3 Jan 2014], according to a statement yesterday [5 Jan 2014] from Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP). Few details about his illness were available in official and media reports, other than that he is hospitalized.

Meanwhile, a 34-year-old woman from Zhejiang province is hospitalized in critical condition with an H7N9 infection, according to a separate CHP statement. Her symptoms began on [29 Dec 2013] and she was hospitalized on [2 Jan 2014]; the virus was confirmed in her respiratory samples 2 days later [4 Jan 2014]. She is in critical condition.

The woman is from the city of Zhuji, and her illness is the 1st H7N9 case reported in Zhejiang province this year [2014], Xinhua, China's state news agency, reported yesterday [5 Jan 2014]. In the middle of December [2013] the province reported 2 cases, in a 57-year-old man and his 30-year-old son-in-law.

More Guangdong cases
--------------------
The other 2 cases are both in southern China's Guangdong province, where most of China's most recent cases were detected. The CHP said today [6 Jan 2014] that one of the patients is a 47-year-old man who is a poultry worker from Foshan and became ill on [25 Dec 2013]. He was hospitalized in Guangzhou on [3 Jan 2014] and is in critical condition. Provincial health officials are monitoring 60 of the man's close contacts, but so far no other H7N9 infections have been detected.

Guangdong province's other new case involves a 71-year-old man from Yangjiang who got sick on [1 Jan 2014] and was admitted to a hospital on [4 Jan 2014] where he is in critical condition, according to the CHP. He had no history of recent contact with poultry. Authorities have 65 of his close contacts under medical surveillance, but so far no other cases have been found.

In a related development, the World Health Organization (WHO) today [6 Jan 2014] confirmed 2 earlier reported H7N9 infections in Guangdong province.

One of them is in a 62-year-old man with a history of exposure to live poultry who started having symptoms on [11 Dec 2013], was admitted to a hospital on [16 Dec 2013], and remains in critical condition. The other patient is a 38-year-old man who got sick on [9 Dec 2013] and was hospitalized on [18 Dec 2013], according to the WHO. He is still in critical condition.

The 4 new cases push the number of H7N9 cases on China's mainland to 148, according to the CHP. Additionally, 4 cases with ties to the mainland have been reported elsewhere -- 2 in Hong Kong and 2 in Taiwan.

The WHO also acknowledged the previously reported [26 Dec 2013] death of an 80-year-old man who had the 2nd of 2 imported H7N9 cases recently reported in Hong Kong. Both of Hong Kong's patients had been in the nearby mainland city of Shenzhen, in Guangdong province, before their infections were detected.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a [20 Dec 2013] risk assessment update that the pace of H7N9 detections started increasing in early October [2013] along with the arrival of cooler weather in China and that the cases aren't unexpected. It noted that some of the patients had contact with poultry and lived in areas where the virus had been detected earlier.

H7N9 illnesses are still showing a sporadic pattern and there is no sign of sustained human-to-human transmission, the CDC said.

In other developments, authorities in Guangdong province announced that environmental samples from a wet market in Zengcheng, a suburb of Guangzhou, tested positive for the H7N9 virus, according to a translation of a Xinhua report provided by Flu in China. The samples that tested positive were 2 from a goose cage and one sewage water sample. Flu in China is a Web-based information network of flu researchers, public health professionals, and other experts based in and outside of China. Guangdong province reported its 1st H7N9 poultry market positive samples in May [2013], well before it reported its 1st human case. The new H7N9 detections in a poultry market follow virus detections in a Shenzhen market in December [2013] during the investigation of the 2 imported human H7N9 infections that occurred in Hong Kong. The H7N9 detections in Shenzhen prompted temporary market closures to curb the spread of the virus in one of the city's districts. In December, Shanghai announced it would temporarily close live poultry markets on [31 Jan 2014], the 1st day of the Lunar New Year, to prevent the spread of H7N9, according to earlier reports.
