As of 13 Sep 2007, 254 cases of potential chikungunya virus infection were
identified in Emilia Romagna Region as a result of ongoing active
surveillance activities. Chikungunya virus infection was confirmed by
laboratory tests in samples obtained from 78 of the notified potential
cases. Among confirmed cases, the most recent date of onset was 4 Sep 2007.
Epidemiological data collected so far indicate that indigenous transmission
might have occurred in 4 different localities. Chikungunya virus has been
isolated from _Aedes albopictus_ mosquitoes collected in the affected
areas. Intense vector control activities, led by regional and local health
authorities, are continuing.
Upon invitation of the Ministry of Health of Italy, a team comprising
experts form French institutions involved in the investigation of the
chikungunya virus outbreak in La Reunion in 2006, representatives from the
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and
representatives of the WHO Regional Office for Europe, will be visiting
regional and national health authorities starting from 17 Sep 2007. The
mission will be a precious opportunity to better understand the current
outbreak in Italy as well as for WHO to improve its preparedness strategy
for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne diseases in the European Region.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Hubner for bringing this article to our attention.
He pointed out that there were 2 confirmed cases from the northern province
of Lombardia. They had travelled to the Ravenna region before the fever and
joint pain started, a good example of how individuals can move the virus to
most distant localities while in the incubation period. Thus, new foci can
be established if there are abundant competent vector mosquitoes, as could
be the case for _Aedes albopictus_ in warmer areas of Europe and North America.
