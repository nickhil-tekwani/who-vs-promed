Parts of Michigan are on the hunt this summer for mosquitoes carrying a
deadly virus -- and traces of the virus have been found in the Kalamazoo
and Gladwin areas.
The virus is eastern equine encephalitis, EEE, and it has infected 8 people
in Michigan since 1980. Four of them died, the last in 1997.
There is no vaccine for humans and no treatment once a person is infected.
"EEE has been detected in mosquitoes and some wild birds this year, and
therefore we are reminding people to take extra precautions when they are
out of doors," Denise Yockey said Friday. She is a spokeswoman for the
Michigan Department of Agriculture.
The virus is carried to humans by mosquitoes which have first bitten an
infected bird, then bite a person.
The disease is more often passed to horses; 253 Michigan horses have died
of the virus since 1980, the most recent in 1996. But there's a vaccine
that will prevent the disease in horses.
Health departments and other agencies in 22 Michigan counties are
collecting mosquitoes each week and testing them for EEE.
"The majority of cases have been in the southwestern part of the state,"
said Edwin Coll, director of environmental health services for Macomb County.
EEE is a relatively rare disease [in people]. Only 163 cases were reported
nationally since 1964.
Some people who are infected have no symptoms. Some have a mild, flu-like
illness. But if the virus infects the central nervous system, it can be
disastrous. The victim will develop a sudden fever and severe headache
followed quickly by seizures and coma. About half these people die. The
rest may suffer permanent brain damage.
