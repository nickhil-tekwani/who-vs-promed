In a paper published in today's issue of the journal Science (21st Jan
2000: P. Daszak, A.A. Cunningham & A.D. Hyatt Vol 287, 443-449) we describe
a group of "emerging" infectious diseases of wildlife and discuss the
threats these pose to the conservation of biodiversity and to human health.
In our review, we applied the criteria originally used to define EID
predominantly affecting humans, to focus on wildlife diseases that are
newly recognized, newly appeared in the population or rapidly increasing in
incidence or geographic range.
The underlying causal factors of the emergence of these wildlife EID show
distinct parallels with those underlying emergence of EID in humans. We
identify three principal causes of emergence: 1) "spill-over" of pathogens
from domestic animals to wildlife; 2) translocation of host and/or
pathogens for conservation, agriculture & hunting (termed "pathogen
pollution"); 3) emergence without overt human involvement (e.g. climate
oscillations).
Two consequences of wildlife disease emergence are highlighted. First,
wildlife EID have been implicated in mass mortality events, population
declines, local (population) extinctions and global (species) extinctions -
therefore they represent a significant threat to conservation of global
biodiversity. Second, many wildlife species are reservoir hosts of
pathogens that threaten domestic animal and human health. Potential
measures to counter these threats are discussed, from basic research into
the ecology and biology of wildlife EID, assessment of their role in
biodiversity loss and their potential cost to human health, and
implementation of practical measures such as legislating to control
"pathogen pollution".

As wild animals are forced into more crowded conditions and moved to new
locations, they face the same threats from newly evolving diseases as
humans do, scientists warn.
The causes of emerging diseases in wildlife are the same as for humans,
explained Peter Daszak of the University of Georgia.
"Basically, it's the globalization of the planet - things are taken abroad
from one country to another, and you spread diseases that way as well,"
said Daszak, lead author of a paper appearing in today's issue of the
journal Science. "We call it pathogen pollution."
Emerging infectious diseases can cause local extinctions among wild animals
and in some cases even lead to total extinction of a species, he said.
Daszak urged scientific research on emerging diseases and on social efforts
to prevent their spread. He also cited legislation to try to prevent the
importing of diseases affecting wild animals; such steps now are taken to
block foot-and-mouth disease, rabies and other diseases.
Emerging infectious diseases among wildlife not only threaten the future of
the animals but also may form a reservoir of germs harmful to people and
domestic animals, Daszak's team warns. This kind of transmission may have
been a factor in the emergence of the virus that causes AIDS as well as the
newer Marburg and Ebola viruses, the paper notes. The international
transport of livestock and current agricultural practices have helped
spread rinderpest in Africa and mad cow disease in Europe, for example.
Even the seemingly most innocent act can pose problems. "Recent analysis
suggests that 15,000 tons of peanuts are fed annually to United Kingdom
garden birds. This form of provisioning has led to the emergence of
infection by salmonella and E. coli in Britain . . . because of the high
density and diversity of birds at feeding stations," the scientists
reported. Similar reports have occurred in the United States.
As humans encroach on animal territory, diseases can move back and forth
between domestic and wild animals. Bringing animals together in zoos and
wild animal parks in an effort to conserve them may also cause problems,
the study notes. For example, researchers have determined that a type of
herpes virus that is harmless to African elephants can be fatal to their
Asian cousins.
