The National Agricultural Research Organisation (NARO) has warned of a new disease reported to be wiping out banana plantations in Uganda and Rwanda. The disease has affected 60% of banana plantations in southwestern Uganda and northern Rwanda. Scientists have advised farmers to cut the affected banana fruits and bury them to reduce the population of insects in the field.

In February 2020, a strange disease [ProMED post 20200214.6987577] hit banana plantations in the western region and spread to more than 10 districts.

[A number of banana pathogens have been reported from the region, for example, _Banana bunchy top virus_; bacterial wilt (in central Africa caused by _Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_, BXW); fungal diseases including black and yellow sigatoka (_Mycosphaerella_ species); Panama disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_, including tropical race 4, TR4); and anthracnose (_Colletotrichum_ species). (For more information, see previous ProMED posts in the archives.)

In East Africa, xanthomonas wilt (BXW) is considered one of the most serious limitations for banana cultivation. It was reported from both Uganda and Rwanda in the early 2000s. An outbreak of fungal anthracnose in the Western Region of Uganda was suspected in 2020 (ProMED post 20200214.6987577). Main means of spread for both diseases is infected planting material and through insect activities, the likely reason that insect control has been recommended above. However, an undiagnosed disease with symptoms not closely resembling BXW or anthracnose was also reported recently from western Uganda (ProMED post 20210601.8413562). It is unclear whether this and the disease above are considered to be related or identical. The problems may also be due to a combination of one or several pathogens and/or other factors. Reliable diagnosis is required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.
