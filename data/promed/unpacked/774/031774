Florida animal health authorities placed horses at Gulfstream Park under quarantine on 9 Nov 2016 after one horse died of clinical signs related to equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1). Gulfstream is a thoroughbred racetrack and casino located in Broward County.

On 8 Nov 2016, a private veterinarian reported that a horse had exhibited neurologic signs at Gulfstream. The horse became neurologic on 6 Nov 2016 and died of natural causes later that day, subsequently testing positive for a wild-type strain of EHV-1. No other horses at Gulfstream have presented with clinical signs consistent with EHV-1 infection, according to a statement released by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Animal Industry (Florida DAI).

Florida DAI is continuing its disease investigation and requiring enhanced biosecurity measures for all barns on the premises. In addition, animal health authorities are requiring monitoring of all horses on the facility for neurologic signs. Resident horses must have their temperatures taken twice daily, and any horse with a temperature greater than 101.5 F [38 C] is to be tested for EHV-1.

The state is recommending close monitoring of horses that have trained at Gulfstream Park between 3 Nov 2016 and the present and reporting of fevers greater than 101.5 F [38 C]. The state is also recommending strict biosecurity measures for at least 21 days after departure from Gulfstream Park. Additional movement requirements or restrictions have not been imposed by Florida or any other states at this time.

Equine herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

[This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
