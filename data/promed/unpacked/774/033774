Büyükada, the biggest of Istanbul's Princes' Islands and home to a large cat population, is fighting a feline disease epidemic, animal rights activists say. They counted some 700 cats among the victims in the past 4 months [February-May 2022], while others struggle for their lives.

The cats are suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), according to initial findings, a viral infection caused by strains of a virus, also known as feline coronavirus. Volunteers have made efforts to place stray cats in quarantine.

Neslihan Sipahioğlu, a volunteer caring for the cats on the island, says she was caring for 210 cats in one area of the island she was "responsible" for and their number dropped to 50. Celal Karabulut, a vet checking the cats, adds that FIP is a deadly disease for cats.

The infectious disease without a known cure prompted animal lovers to build makeshift quarantine rooms for cats. Those with severe symptoms are cared for in abandoned, unused buildings on the island.

Sipahioğlu told Demirören News Agency (DHA) on Friday [3 Jun 2022] that they were "picking up dead bodies" off the streets and personally witnessed 8 cats dying. "It is a desperate situation. There is medication for them, but it is very expensive and not easily accessible. I paid for expensive treatment for 3 cats but not all treatment, medication options produce results for all cats," she said. Sipahioğlu added that the infections had appeared to reach their peak, while the volunteers continued to do "all we can."

Metin Türkmenoğlu, another volunteer who has been recording the number of cats dying on the island since 2013, says every year up to 500 cats died since then for various reasons but this year [2022], the situation was "dire." "Between January and May [2022], some 700 cats died. In the past, they used to die of wounds from dog attacks or after they were hit by vehicles. This time, the majority of deaths stem from FIP. Roughly 7 out of every 10 cats die of FIP," he said, urging authorities to take measures to protect the felines.

Karabulut says there was no alternative therapy for infected cats and the disease affected even kittens while they were still in the womb of infected mothers. On the root cause of infections, he pointed out that it may have spread due to cats' habit of eating together or in areas they collectively use for defecation.

[Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a common disease of cats caused by a feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoV is relatively rare in free-roaming ownerless cats because stray cats usually do not have close contact with each other, and they tend not to use the same site to defecate, which is the major route of transmission. However, the density of cats in Istanbul's islands is really high and this favors viral exposure. - Mod.PMB
