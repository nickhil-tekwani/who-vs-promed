JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS - JAPAN (02): VACCINATIONS HALTED

The Japanese government has announced it is suspending the government
Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination program which uses the inactivated
mouse brain-derived JE vaccine, the only vaccine currently licensed in
Japan. The license for the vaccine is not suspended, and vaccines are still
available on an individual basis. In addition, 2 new cell culture-derived
vaccines are in advanced stages of development in Japan (undergoing Phase
III trials), and licensure is expected as early as 2006. It is reasonable
to believe that the decision to suspend vaccination was related to the
short timeline for new vaccine licensure in Japan.
While the risk of any severe side effect of immunization is of concern, JE
is a disease with a fatality rate of up to 30 percent, and approximately
one 3rd of survivors are left with severe neurological disabilities.
Recognition of adverse events after immunization with the inactivated
vaccine, including the very rare but known cases of acute disseminated
encephalomyelitis, has been a major factor spurring the development of new
JE vaccines with improved safety profiles. The other JE vaccine currently
available is the SA 14-14-2 live, attenuated vaccine. It has an excellent
safety record, and, in studies to date, no severe adverse events have been
reported (1,2,3). Over 200 million children have been vaccinated with this
vaccine since production began, and the vaccine is now licensed in China,
Nepal and South Korea. In addition to the 2 new cell culture-derived
Japanese vaccines, other cell culture-derived vaccines, chimeric and other
types of JE vaccine are in development.
JE is a disease that circulates in the environment, with birds and pigs as
the principal amplifying hosts, and it is, therefore, not a disease that
can be eradicated. Regular studies ascertaining the prevalence of
antibodies in humans and seroconversion in pigs demonstrate the virus is
still circulating in Japan, often with serious consequences in those
infected. In a recent outbreak of JE in the Chugoku district of Japan in
2002, 5 of 6 patients had a severe outcome, including one death (4). The
low number of cases of JE seen in Japan is a result of their immunization
program, not a lack of circulating virus. It is anticipated the government
vaccination program and strategy will be reconsidered when a new JE vaccine
becomes available.

[ProMED is grateful for having Dr. Jacobson's commentary, which is both
informative and comprehensive. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is deadly. Owing
to the complicated endemic nature of JE, which involves an arthropod vector
(a wide range of susceptible mosquito species), amplifying animals (birds
and pigs), a flavivirus (JE virus) and humans, eradication of the disease
is not feasible with the current knowledge of JE biology. Nevertheless, it
is preventable by vaccination. But not all the vaccines available are safe.
Severe adverse reactions after immunization with inactivated vaccines are
often reported due to mouse-brain myelin contamination. For this reason, an
alternative vaccine with a better safety profile is urgently needed. For
more reviews, ProMED subscribers are encouraged to check into the archived
articles on the subject. - Mod.RY]
