Cattle deaths due to botulism are on the rise, with increased risks of feed contamination from recent mice plagues across eastern Australia.

A recent botulism outbreak in Western Victoria was the result of unvaccinated dairy cattle being fed silage contaminated with dead mice, resulting in significant losses. Management of these outbreaks is a major logistical exercise and traumatic for both livestock and producers.

Botulism is a severe and often fatal disease of cattle caused by exposure to a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. Under favourable conditions, active spores can lead to bacterial growth, and the resulting toxin can kill cattle when accidentally ingested.

Virbac Australia technical services manager and owner of Beacon Veterinary at Alstonville, northern NSW, Dr Matthew Ball, issued a warning this morning [29 Sep 2021] about botulism risk.

"Botulism is one of the most lethal toxins on earth, potentially killing thousands of Australian cattle each year. Its spores multiply suddenly, and if toxin from active bacteria gets into the body, it affects the junctions between the muscles and nerves, leading to paralysis, and often death," he said.

Botulism comes from a bacterial toxin proliferating in the carcasses of dead mice. This year's [2021] plague has seen mice moving into hay sheds and feed storage facilities containing grain and silage, creating ideal conditions for contamination and development of the botulism toxin.

When livestock eat the hay and pieces of the carcasses, they become poisoned. This causes flaccid paralysis, which results in the animals going down, unable to eat or drink and eventually dying. Large numbers of stock may be affected, and there is no treatment.

In some historical cases, more than half the cattle in a herd have died.

Dr Ball said it was prudent for southern livestock producers to vaccinate for botulism, regardless of whether or not it was planned to feed hay, due to the extreme contamination of paddocks with mice carcasses this year [2021].

"There are some highly effective botulism vaccines proving protection after just one injection," he said. "This makes it easy for cattle farmers to add botulism vaccination to their herd.

"Vaccination is the only option to mitigate the risk for cattle producers, as botulism infection can drastically affect both profit and productivity," Dr Ball said. "And if more animals in high-risk areas can be saved, it's a huge welfare improvement, as well. Put simply, vaccination means fewer deaths and a more successful farm business, facts all worth considering when producers are looking at the best way to protect both a farm's animals and its livelihood."

Virbac's botulism vaccine, Singvac, is available as an annual vaccine or a vaccine with a 3-year claim. For southern beef and dairy producers, it is recommended to use an annual botulism vaccination program.

[While this may initially appear as an advertisement, it is, in fact, a warning. Dead mice in the hay or even silage can cause botulism in cattle. This particular vaccine is a good way to prevent botulism in cattle, although to muster the cattle and get them all vaccinated is no small feat on many of the ranches.

"Botulinum toxin
Botulism in cattle is caused by toxins produced by _Clostridium botulinum_. _Clostridium botulinum_ is commonly found in soil, water, and marine sediments around the world, but it is also a normal inhabitant of the intestinal tract of many healthy horses, cattle, and poultry. Other Clostridial bacteria cause diseases in farm animals including blackleg, black disease, swelled head, tetanus, and enterotoxaemia. All these bacteria produce long-lived spores, which ensure survival in the environment. Spores germinate in moist, low-oxygen environments, such as rotting carcasses or decaying organic material, and under favourable conditions proliferate and produce botulinum toxin, leading to intoxication if consumed.

"The bacteria produce one of several forms of toxin, designated botulinum A to G. Almost all cases of botulism in cattle in Western Australia [WA] and in the southern hemisphere in general are due to botulinum types C and D. Type B toxin is more often observed in Europe and northern America.

"Botulinum toxin is extremely potent, and minute doses can be lethal. The toxin interferes with the connections between nerves and muscles, causing paralysis. All species, including humans, can be affected, although there is wide variation in sensitivity. Handling affected cattle is not a risk to humans.

"Botulism in Australian cattle
Nearly all cases in cattle are due to taking in preformed toxin rather than from live bacteria multiplying in the intestinal tract.

Botulism in cattle occurs throughout Australia. Outbreaks of botulism in cattle are associated with
- bone chewing: In pastoral areas in the north of WA, cattle chew on bones and decaying carcasses when deficient in protein and phosphorus. This is usually seen during the dry season and in late autumn and summer;
- contaminated feed: Contamination of feed rolls by carrion carcasses can result in large outbreaks on dairy farms, feedlots, and intensive beef farms in a short time due to ingestions of feed containing the botulism toxin;
- spoiled feed: Decaying feed may contain botulinum toxin. _Clostridium botulinum_ can also proliferate in vegetable matters such as silage that has not reached adequate acid levels of pH 4.5 or less. This occurs when the level of soluble sugar in grass is insufficient to produce the acid necessary to preserve the silage. Type B toxin can be associated with spoiled vegetable matter;
- toxicoinfectious botulism: This very rare form occurs when the intestine or a wound is infected with proliferating _Clostridium botulinum_ bacteria, which then releases botulinum toxin into the body.

"How to recognise botulism
Signs of botulism include [the following]:
- cattle of all ages can be affected
- sudden outbreak in a herd with cattle showing collapse, muscular weakness, and paralysis
- downer cattle
- uncoordinated, stumbling, and knuckling when walking
- flaccid paralysis of the tail, constipation
- weakness or flaccid paralysis of the hind legs, then progressing towards the head
- paralysis of the muscles of the face, jaw, and tongue
- unable to eat or drink
- tongue hanging out of mouth and unable to control or withdraw the tongue
- drooling
- paralysis of the eyelids or drooping eyelids, animals otherwise alert
- shallow, abdominal breathing
- sudden death with a high fatality rate; in unvaccinated extensive pastoral herds, botulism usually shows as unexpected numbers dead or missing at mustering.

"Timing of disease signs
The development of the signs and disease progress depend on the amount of toxin ingested:
- signs are usually seen within 2-6 days after eating contaminated material
- high doses of the toxin will produce botulism within 12-24 hours
- lower doses of the toxin will produce signs of botulism within 7-20 days
- in a herd outbreak, most deaths will occur within the 1st week, but can continue for up to 3 weeks.

"Diagnosing botulism and diseases that may look like botulism"
"Detection of the botulism toxin in the suspect material is the most reliable test method. It is important to take samples from any potential source as soon as botulism is suspected. Samples can be frozen if required.

"Other diseases that may look like botulism include
- milk fever
- ketosis
- dairy downer cow syndrome
- organophosphate poisoning
- spinal cord disease or trauma
- 3-day sickness (ephemeral fever)
- tick fever: a reportable animal disease in parts of WA
- rabies: a reportable animal disease in WA."
