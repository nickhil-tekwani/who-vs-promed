[Although this outbreak has only been confirmed as an H5 [not yet
H5N1], OIE WAHID has reported outbreaks of H5 or H5N1 in 7 Southeast
Asian countries since the beginning of 2011, including Japan, South
Korea, Hong Kong, Myanmar, Cambodia, Bangladesh and now India. While
the occurrence isn't nearly as widespread or the incidence of new
outbreaks occurring at as breakneck speed as happened previously, it
is important to note that H5N1 is still a significant virus infection
in poultry populations in Southeast Asia. Thus, rapid and throughly
implemented control measures as proposed for this outbreak are
warranted. For a list of the OIE WAHID reports, see
http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/update-on-avian-influenza/2011/.


The location of the outbreak in Tripura Province may provide some clue
as to how the disease occurred in India. Tripura Province is that part
of India between Bangladesh on the east and Myanmar on the west.
Epidemiologically, it is always a challenge to know whether geography
is most important in controlling spread or whether administrative
disease control units and programs, in this case through the Indian
Ministry of Agriculture, are the key factor.

The location of these outbreaks can be seen appended to the OIE WAHID
report referenced above or at the HealthMap site. A summary and very
crowded map of the outbreaks in nearby Bangladesh can also seen at the
OIE website at
