Vibrio vulnificus kills wader in Durban
-----------------------------------------------------
A 55 year old South African died from V vulnificus infection after collecting
sand prawns, wading in shallow water in Durban harbour. The victim, "became
ill within a few days of wading in the harbour". A spokesman for McCord
Hospital and a Durban microbiologist "both confirmed that V vulnifiucs
infections were rarely reported" in South Africa. Further details such as
presenting symptoms, method of diagnosis, presence or absence of complicating
factors, treatment and clinical course are unknown.

Bacteria in Durban harbour causes man's death
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A fisherman has died from an unusual cholera-type bacteria infection after
wading in shallow water in Durban harbour, raising concern about the use of
the harbour for recreation activities.

A 55-year-old Woodlands resident, picked up the infection while collecting sand
prawns near the Fynnland angling club about 10 days ago.

His fishing friend, was also admitted to hospital with a blood infection after
wading at the same spot, near the mouths of the Amanzimnyama and Umhlatuzana
canals.

Though the news has raised fears about the quality of harbour water, medical
experts said the cases were unusual because both men had small cuts or wounds
on their legs, through which bacteria entered directly into their bloodstreams.

Tests suggested it was a different type of bacteria

The bacteria which killed [this patient] is common in warm salt-water estuaries
in several parts of the world but does not often affect healthy people unless
they have open wounds or eat uncooked seafood.

A City Health department spokesperson has declined to comment until the case
has been investigated further, but it is believed that officials have collected
water samples near the club to establish whether there are unusually high
levels of bacteria.

[The patient] became ill within days of wading in the harbour and died last
week as a result of poisoning by _Vibrio vunificus_, a cousin of the cholera
virus.

His friend, became ill a few days afterwards and was admitted to McCord
Hospital with bulbous lumps under his arm. He was discharged on Wednesday.
A spokesperson said staff suspected initially that [his fishing mate] might
have the same infection as [him] but tests suggested it was a different type of
bacteria.

There was also an unconfirmed report on Wednesday night that a young boy picked
up a blood infection through a cut on his neck while swimming at Addington
beach, allegedly leading to the subsequent discovery of old syringes and
bandages on the beach in front of Addington hospital.

Although the _Vibrio vulnificus_ bacteria which attacked [the patient] is a
common salt-water organism human fatalities are rare. However, in cases where
direct blood infections were the result of cuts or open wounds exposed to sea
water, the fatality rate can be as high as 50 percent according to American
government Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. [[see moderator comments
below. The CDC reference site can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/vibriovulnificus_t.htm> - Mod.MPP]

A spokesperson for McCord and a Durban microbiologist both confirmed that
Vibrio vulnificus infections were rarely reported in this country. The
microbiologist felt it would be misleading to create hysteria by suggesting
that there was an outbreak of "a beastly killer bug" in Durban harbour.

[According to Chin's Control of Communicable Diseases Manual, infection with
_Vibrio vulnificus_ produces septicemia in persons with chronic liver disease,
chronic alcoholism or hemochromatosis, or those who are immunosuppressed. The
disease appears 12 hours to 3 days after eating raw or undercooked seafood,
especially oysters. One third of the patients are in shock when they present
for care or develop hypotension (low blood pressure) within 12 hours after
hospital admission. Three quarters of patients have distinctive, bullous skin
lesions (large blister-like); thrombocytopenia (low platelets) is common and
there is often evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Over 50
percent of patients with primary septicemia die; the mortality rate exceeds 90
percent among those who become hypotensive. _V. vulnificus can also infect
wounds sustained in coastal or estuarine waters; wounds range from mild self
limited lesions to rapidly progressive cellulitis (skin infection) and myositis
that can mimic clostridial myonecrosis (muscle tissue death) in the rapidity of
spread and destructiveness.

The organism is a halophilic lactose positive (85 percent of isolates) marine
vibrio similar to _V. parahaemolyticus biochemically. It is a free-living
autochtonous flora of estuarine environments. It is the most common agent of
serious infections caused by the genus vibrio in the USA (in coastal areas of
the USA the annual incidence of infection is 0.5 per 100 000 population). It
has been reported from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Israel, Spain and Turkey.
(A review of the literature included additional case reports and or _V.
vulnificus isolates from Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Korea, Thailand,
Australia, Saudi Arabia, Czech Republic, Denmark, French West Indies, Mexico ,
Brazil and Senegal. If I missed a few locations, my apologies -- there were
510 references related to _V. vulnificans). A few selected references are
presented below.

This appears to be the first case reported from Southern Africa, and with the
case reports from Senegal (ref. 5) this appears to be the second case report
from the African continent. - Mod.MPP]
