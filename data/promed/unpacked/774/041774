[Since the start of the event, reportedly on 12 Aug 2013, Greece has reported a total of 62 outbreaks of sheep pox, all scattered along the north eastern border with Turkey's Ederne region; the most northern outbreak in Greece is close to Bulgaria's territory (3-borders junction Bulgaria/Greece/Turkey). For the mentioned summarising report with map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000014531_20131216_122257.pdf.

Since sheep pox is regarded to be endemic in Turkey, no reports have been required or become available from Turkey since the last 6-monthly periodic report, January-June 2013 (which notified a total of 70 new outbreaks during the said period). The accurate number of new outbreaks is estimated to be higher. In Turkey, mass vaccinations in sheep and goats are reportedly applied; during January-June 2013, 552 210 animals were reportedly vaccinated. The total sheep/goat population of Turkey exceeds 32 million (2012 figures).

Greece, as opposed to Turkey, applies the EU prescribed policy of stamping out; vaccination is prohibited. As can be seen in the summarising report, this has led to the destruction, so far, of 11 639 sheep. Though the causative agent in this epizootic is a sheep-pox virus strain, not affecting goats, according to the regulations, goats in the affected flocks were destroyed as well; their number was 775.

On 11 Dec 2013, Bulgarian media published information on an outbreak of sheep pox in the village of Choba; reportedly, the 85 sheep in the flock were killed and buried. A notification of this event to the OIE is anticipated. An earlier outbreak in Bulgaria, in Burgas -- adjacent to the Turkish border, was reported to the OIE on 23 Sep 2013. - Mod.AS
