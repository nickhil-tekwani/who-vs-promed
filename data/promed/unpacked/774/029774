The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated 11 Sep 2018.
- A total of 133 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, 102 confirmed and 31 probable.
- Of the 102 confirmed, 61 died and 37 are cured .
- 19 suspected cases are under investigation.
- 1 new confirmed case in Butembo: a health worker from the health center in which the 1st confirmed case of Butembo was transiently managed.
- No new deaths. News of the response

News of the response
Review of the 1st month of the response
- All coordinators in Beni, Mabalako, Butembo and Mandima met at the Beni response headquarters with all partners to assess the 1st month of the response. The actors present reviewed each pillar of the response in detail to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the actions taken so far and to identify new approaches. New approaches include improving interdisciplinarity between the various pillars of the response and strengthening local health facilities, especially for infection prevention and control. The report of the discussions will be presented to the Minister of Health and the central coordination of Kinshasa in the coming days.

Retrofitting of health facilities
- At the end of August 2018, the coordination of the response had destroyed the equipment and [closed] the Mapendo health center, located in the Ndindi district in the city of Beni after 2 people were infected with the virus after their passage at the health center. This action was strongly contested by the population of the district. The local committee of Ndindi community leaders made a plea to the [coordinators] for the reopening of the health center. On Tue 11 Sep 2018, the coordinator of the response, Dr. Ndjoloko Tambwe Bathe, proceeded to the delivery of new equipment to fully re-equip the health center which will soon be able to resume its activities with a new medical team, to the great satisfaction of the population.

Vaccination
-Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 8444 people have been vaccinated, including 3613 in Mabalako, 2533 in Beni, 1307 in Mandima, 444 in Butembo, 220 in Masereka, 150 in Katwa, 121 in Oicha and 56 in Kinshasa (medical staff to deploy).

[Another heath care worker (HCW) is reported to have become infected in today's report. This HCW worked in the Ebola Treatment Center where the 1st confirmed case of Butembo was transiently managed. As stated in previous reports, it is dangerous when HCWs become infected as they may infect many others during treatment. It is also unfortunate that HCWs who are doing hazardous work and are needed to treat patients are not all vaccinated prior to having contact with sick individuals. But clearly, that is a difficult objective to achieve. - Mod.LK]

[2] Preparedness
- Wed 12 Sep 2018. Uganda: Ebola Preparedness Emergency Plan of Action (EPoA) - DREF Operation n. MDRUG041; an International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies report
https://reliefweb.int/report/uganda/uganda-ebola-preparedness-emergency-plan-action-epoa-dref-operation-n-mdrug041

Description of the disaster
Following the declaration of the 9th Ebola Disease Outbreak (EVD) on 8 May 2018 by the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ministry of Health, the WHO has raised the alert for neighbouring countries of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) which share extensive borders, hosting DRC refugees and are used as corridors for DRC population movement. On 1 Aug 2018, just 1 week after the declaration of the end of the Ebola outbreak in Equator province, the 10th Ebola epidemic of the DRC was declared in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, which are among the most populated provinces in the DRC that also share borders with Uganda and Rwanda.

The provinces have been experiencing intense insecurity and a worsening humanitarian crisis with over one million internally displaced people (IDPs) and a continuous efflux of refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania. Population mobility, including cross-border movements, were identified as a significant risk for disease transmission in this outbreak due to the high number of traders and miners, displaced populations and insecurity caused by rebels and militias in the area (Source IOM, 15 Aug 2018). Additionally, the security situation in North Kivu may hinder the implementation of response activities. Based on this context, the public health risk is considered high at the national and regional levels.

Since EVD outbreak in DRC continues to spread, WHO has been sending Preparation Support Team (PST) missions to neighbouring countries of DRC to review EVD readiness and support preparedness strategies with government and other stakeholders including RC/RC National Societies. According to their risk profiles, the WHO has categorized 4 countries i.e. Rwanda, Uganda, South Sudan, and Burundi as Priority-1 and remaining 5 countries -- Angola, Congo, Central African Republic, Tanzania, and Zambia are Priority-2. The prioritization was done based on their capacity to manage EVD and viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) outbreaks, and their connections and proximity to the areas currently reporting EVD cases.

The RC/RC National Societies have been supporting government efforts in updating EVD contingency plans and strategies in the early detection/surveillance of cross border population movement, training of volunteers to undertake typical EVD response activities related to infection, prevention and control (IPC), risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, Safe and Dignified Burials (SDB), Psychosocial support and National Society capacity building and preparing for future outbreaks.

In view of the above, potential risk factors for a further EVD expansion into Uganda exist not only at national level, but also at regional level, among which:
- Transport links between the affected areas, the rest of the country, and neighbouring countries;
- Internal displacement of populations;
- Low level of knowledge around Ebola modes of transmission, especially among women (according to a KAP survey done in North-Kivu).
- Displacement of Congolese refugees to neighbouring countries, including Uganda.

Concerning this last point, as of 30 June 2018, 288 766 Congolese form DRC fled into Uganda, 244 858 of whom arrived between January and June 2018 as a direct consequence of inter-communal violence between Lendu and Hema ethnic groups that broke out in December 2017 in Ituri province,and attacks by Mai-Mai militia in North Kivu. Beside the influx of DRC refugees into Uganda for security reasons, cross border population movements between the 2 countries are also common for trade, family, pilgrims, health and education related services reasons1. These population movements have to be considered in addition to those entering into Uganda through official Points of Entry (PoE) for security reasons, estimated at 210 people/day between May and August 2018.

Based on the above, there is a tangible risk of EVD transmission in Uganda, especially as the affected area of Mbalako in Beni (DRC) is approximately 100 km [62 mi] from the western border of Uganda, with active cross-border movements in and out of Kasese, Bundibugyo, and Ntoroko districts.

Furthermore, on 17 Aug 2018, the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) reported 5 suspected EVD cases, which thankfully, were not confirmed after laboratory tests. Nevertheless, the situation remains critical in country, leading the MoH to undertake a series of measures to increase surveillance and preparedness, particularly in districts located along the border with the affected areas in North Kivu and Ituri provinces.

As such the MoH, under technical guidance of WHO has undertaken the below:
- Activated the Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC);
- Reviewed and activated the National Ebola preparedness plan;
- Instituted Ebola Prevention and Preparedness initiatives in target at-risk districts of Kasese, Bundibugyo, Ntoroko and Kabarole.

In line with the outbreak, preparedness measures were undertaken by UN agencies among which WHO, UNHCR and UNICEF which collaborate with the MoH for conducting, directly or through operational and implementing partners, preparedness activities.

The Uganda Red Cross Society (URCS) has been participating in MoH led coordination meetings and engaging in preparedness activities such as reviewing EVD contingency plan, surveillance on cross border population movement and mobilization of people for potential response. The National Society has been coordinating with country Movement partners including IFRC, ICRC, Netherlands Red Cross, German Red Cross, Belgium Red CrossFlanders, Austrian Red Cross and Canadian Red Cross for support in potential health, WATSAN, training of volunteers and CEA activities.

WHO, for its part, has been supporting URCS through the training of RC volunteers who have been deployed by the National Society to work in the most at risk districts. WHO and UNICEF are also supporting National Society in developing the risk communication tools and protocols for surveillance, and risks assessments.

Considering URCS`s experience and skill in EVD preparedness, it has been recognized as a key partner in community risk communication, social mobilization and community engagement, community-based surveillance and screening, Safe and Dignified Burial (SDB) and Psychosocial support (PSS). It is in line with these pillars that URCS has developed this Ebola Preparedness plan of action. As such, the proposed DREF operation seeks [Swiss francs] 145 512 to support 144 300 people for 3 months.

[3] New publications of note (4):
Four papers are listed that address contact tracing performance, vaccine development, and pan-Ebola virus antibody.

Swanson KC, Altare C, Wesseh CS, et al. Contact tracing performance during the Ebola epidemic in Liberia, 2014-2015. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2018; 12(9):e0006762.
https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0006762

Author summary
Contact tracing is comprised of 3 main steps: identifying, listing, and monitoring persons who have been exposed to infected individuals, with the goal of rapidly diagnosing and treating new cases and preventing further spread of infection. This approach has been used to control transmission of infectious diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, HIV, and syphilis, and while contact tracing has been used in prior outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever, these outbreaks were small in scale. During the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in Liberia, contact tracing was implemented in all 15 counties on a scale that was unprecedented, particularly within both rural and crowded urban settings. This work provides insight into the magnitude that which contact tracing was implemented, its characteristics, as well as an assessment on its performance. Given that contract tracing is a critical tool for controlling disease spread, these findings aid in informing future planning and decision making for its implementation.

Abstract
The West African Ebola virus (EBOV) epidemic has fast-tracked countermeasures for this rare, emerging zoonotic pathogen. Until 2013-2014, most EBOV vaccine candidates were stalled between the preclinical and clinical milestones on the path to licensure, because of funding problems, lack of interest from pharmaceutical companies, and competing priorities in public health. The unprecedented and devastating epidemic propelled vaccine candidates toward clinical trials that were initiated near the end of the active response to the outbreak. Those trials did not have a major impact on the epidemic but provided invaluable data on vaccine safety, immunogenicity, and, to a limited degree, even efficacy in humans. There are plenty of lessons to learn from these trials, some of which are addressed in this review. Better preparation is essential to executing an effective response to EBOV in the future; yet, the 1st indications of waning interest are already noticeable.

Abstract
Only one naturally occurring human antibody has been described thus far that is capable of potently neutralizing all 5 ebolaviruses. Here we present 2 crystal structures of this rare, pan-ebolavirus neutralizing human antibody in complex with Ebola virus and Bundibugyo virus glycoproteins (GPs), respectively. The structures delineate the key protein and glycan contacts for binding that are conserved across the ebolaviruses, explain the antibody's unique broad specificity and neutralization activity, and reveal the likely mechanism behind a known escape mutation in the fusion loop region of GP2. We found that the epitope of this antibody, ADI-15878, extends along the hydrophobic paddle of the fusion loop and then dips down into a highly conserved pocket beneath the N-terminal tail of GP2, a mode of recognition unlike any other antibody elicited against Ebola virus, and likely critical for its broad activity. The fold of Bundibugyo virus glycoprotein, not previously visualized, is similar to the fold of Ebola virus GP, and ADI-15878 binds to each virus's GP with a similar strategy and angle of attack. These findings will be useful in deployment of this antibody as a broad-spectrum therapeutic and in the design of immunogens that elicit the desired broadly neutralizing immune response against all members of the ebolavirus genus and filovirus family. Importance: There are 5 different members of the Ebolavirus genus. Provision of vaccines and treatments able to protect against any of the 5 ebolaviruses is an important goal of public health. Antibodies are a desired result of vaccines and can be delivered directly as therapeutics. Most antibodies, however, are effective against only one or 2, not all, of these pathogens. Only one human antibody has been thus far described to neutralize all 5 ebolaviruses, antibody ADI-15878. Here we describe the molecular structure of ADI-15878 bound to the relevant target proteins of Ebola virus and Bundibugyo virus. We explain how it achieves its rare breadth of activity and propose strategies to design improved vaccines capable of eliciting more antibodies like ADI-15878.

Abstract
Ebola virus infection causes severe disease in humans and represents a global health threat. Candidates for immunotherapeutics and vaccines have shown promise in clinical trials, though they are ineffective against other members of the Ebolavirus genus which also cause periodic, lethal outbreaks. Here, we present a crystal structure of a pan-ebolavirus antibody, 6D6, as well as single particle electron microscopy reconstructions of 6D6 in complex with Ebola and Bundibugyo virus glycoproteins. 6D6 binds to the conserved glycoprotein fusion peptide, implicating it as a site of immune vulnerability that could be exploited to reliably elicit a pan-ebolavirus neutralizing antibody response.
