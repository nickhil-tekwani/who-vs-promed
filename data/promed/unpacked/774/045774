[Equine influenza is a highly infectious disease of horses. It is not a zoonotic disease. For background, please refer to the comprehensive commentary by Mod.TG in posting 20120120.1016186. France's administrative map with departments' numbers is available at http://tinyurl.com/768cn3n.

Seine-et-Marne is France's department No 77, named after the Seine and Marne rivers, located in the Ile-de-France region, east of Paris. Finistere is department No 29 of France, located at the extreme west of Brittany.

The RESPE network is a European equine epidemiological and pathological service founded on the basis of a veterinary relay sentry system, established in 1999. The RESPE comes from voluntary work carried out by the "commission on infectious and parasitical diseases" of the French Equine Veterinary Association AVEF. It has become since 8 Apr 2008 an independent service for watching and warning of equine pathological problems.

The above alert notification is self explanatory, though it remains to be studied if infection occurred in Ireland or during further transportation. Serotyping of the causative agent and details on the distribution of the (allegedly, hundreds) ponies purchased in the (unspecified) sale will, hopefully, help in limiting further spread and losses, by isolation of the introduced purchased animals at destinations and vaccination of their contacts. - Mod.AS
