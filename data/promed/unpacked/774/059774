Bird flu signs found in Dutch ducks, 600 culled
-----------------------------------------------
The Dutch government has ordered the culling of 600 ducks on a farm
after routine blood tests showed signs of antibodies to a mild strain
of bird flu, the agriculture ministry said late on Monday.
The ministry said in a statement that it had decided to order the
culling of the ducks in Lopik in the central province of Utrecht
after antibodies showed up that could indicate the birds were in
contact with the contagious virus.
A follow-up test did not confirm an outbreak of bird flu, but a
further test was not able to rule out a mild strain of the virus, so
the ministry ordered the preventative culling.
On Saturday, the government decided to cull all 22 000 chickens at a
farm in Eemsmond in the northeast of the country as a precautionary
step, after blood samples taken there also indicated birds had
developed antibodies to the virus.
2 neighbouring poultry farms and a 3rd company owned by relatives of
the owners of the Eemsmond farm were still under investigation,
although preliminary tests were all negative. The results of further
tests will be available in 10 to 14 days.
During 2003, a mild form of the virus mutated into an aggressive
variant, leading to the slaughter of a quarter of all Dutch poultry
at a cost of hundreds of millions of euros. [The Netherlands], the
European Union's largest poultry exporter, slaughtered 30.7 million
birds at some 1300 farms to contain the outbreak of the virus that
led to one human death.
