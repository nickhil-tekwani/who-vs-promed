Tests have confirmed 14 cases of meningitis in Central Darfur, with reports of other cases in South, North, and East Darfur. Medical sources told Radio Dabanga that 14 meningitis (cerebro-spinal fever) cases have been confirmed through lab tests in Central Darfur.

The sources pointed to the presence of cases in South Darfur, denied by the Ministry of Health and the state government.

On Wednesday [28 Mar 2018], Nyala witnessed the overcrowding of large numbers of patients in the private clinic and health centres after the hospital was completely free of any medical staff after the withdrawal of deputy specialists working in the hospital.

[Sudan is a country in the Nile Valley of North Africa. It is divided into 18 states or wilayat (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan). Five states (Central, East, North, South, and West Darfur) compose the Darfur region in western Sudan (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur). Nyala, with a population of 565 734 (2007), is capital of South Darfur (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyala,_Sudan). For a map of Sudan showing the location of Nyala, see https://www.google.com/maps/@12.0521585,24.909482,6z.

The African "meningitis belt", which stretches from Senegal in West Africa to the Horn of Africa in the east and includes Sudan, has been plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal meningitis (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to April) and end at the onset of the rainy season (May to June). Larger outbreaks occur every 8-12 years. A map of the African bacterial meningitis belt can be found at http://www.medic8.com/images/map4-9.gif.

The predominant pathogen had been meningococcus serogroup A. However, after preventive mass vaccination of the population with conjugate meningococcal meningitis serogroup A vaccine (MenA) was introduced in 2010, the epidemiology of meningitis in the African meningitis belt changed. As of November 2017, more than 280 million people have been vaccinated in 21 African belt countries (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). In Sudan, the vaccination campaign against meningococcal A meningitis was launched in 2012, targeting 16.9 million children and adults in the 5 Darfur states (Central, East, North, South, and West Darfur), Blue Nile, Khartoum, Gezira, Sennar and Gedaref.

Subsequently, in the African meningitis belt, serogroup A meningococcus has been replaced by other meningococcal serogroups and other bacterial species. However, the above news report fails to specify what pathogen is causing meningitis in the Darfur region. - Mod.ML
