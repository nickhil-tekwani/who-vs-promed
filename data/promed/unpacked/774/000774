CHOLERA, NON-O1 - NETHERLANDS ex SPAIN (CANARY ISLANDS)

On [Sat 18 Jul 2009], a 53-year-old Dutch man, recently diagnosed
with scleroderma, complicated by delayed duodenal emptying, was
admitted to a hospital in the Netherlands because of profuse diarrhea
for one day. He had been treated with prednisolone 15 mg and
esomeprazole 80 mg a day. He was severely dehydrated and had lost
more than 10 percent of his weight. Laboratory tests showed an
acidosis and hypokalemia. He had returned 5 days earlier from a
holiday in Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, Spain. He had not swum in
natural water nor eaten seafood during his stay. No other members of
his family had symptoms of gastroenteritis.

His feces appeared as rice water and a stool culture was positive for
_Vibrio cholerae_, non-O1 serotype (further typing in progress).
After treatment with oral doxycycline symptoms resolved.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Rozemeijer for this 1st-hand submission. As
can be seen in the "see alsos" below a number of cases of non-O1,
non-O139 infection occurred in Europe during a heat wave in 2006.

As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
non-toxigenic and cause primarily gastroenteritis, but unlike
toxigenic _V. cholerae_ O1 or O139, nontoxigenic _V. cholerae_ do not
cause epidemics. Illness caused by this organism ranges in severity
from mild diarrhea to severe watery diarrhea. Fever and bloody
diarrhea are not typically observed. Immunocompromised persons and
persons with liver disease can experience a more severe illness,
including fever, chills, and septic shock. This organism has rarely
been reported to cause wound infections.

Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"),
a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

The following discussion is taken from a ProMED-mail posting
(Cholera, non-O1, non-O139 - Poland 20061207.3450) extracted from
Eurosurveillance (with references renumbered to begin at 1:

Human cases of infection with _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139
serotypes are more often associated with seawater, but can also occur
in freshwater (1-3). Previous studies of surface water contamination
carried out in 1994-98 and 2004 in eastern regions of Poland, which
border on Ukraine, revealed the presence of _V. cholerae_ non-O1
strains in the water throughout the year, even in winter. Strains
isolated from eastern Polish rivers also did not contain cholera
toxin genes, but 40 percent were found to produce heat-stable
enterotoxin NAG-ST, with varying haemolytic activity, and
toxigenicity was shown in tests on animals (4-6).

In Europe, infections with _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 serotypes
are rare, and sporadic cases are generally reported. Experimental
infections in healthy volunteers and data from gastroenteritis
outbreak investigations indicate that the incubation period is 10
hours in volunteers and 12 to 24 hours in outbreaks. The median
duration of illness ranges from 12 to 24 hours (7).

Symptoms of _V. cholerae_ non-O1, non-O139 infection include
gastroenteritis if large numbers of the bacteria enter the digestive
tract, and wound infections. Septicemia is also a possibility,
especially in infected patients who are immunocompromised (7-9).
