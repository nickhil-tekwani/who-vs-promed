Since the week ending [12 Dec 2021], Ethiopia has seen a total of 1398 suspected meningitis cases with 13 deaths (case fatality ratio (CFR) 0.9%) reported from 11 out of 12 regions in the country.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), since the beginning of the outbreak in the country, 4 regions (Oromia, Somali, SNNPR [Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region], Amhara) crossed the epidemic threshold and 5 regions (Harari, Afar, Addis Ababa, Benishangul-Gumuz, and Gambella) crossed the alert threshold.

The UN agency says the ongoing meningitis outbreak in Ethiopia is concerning as the country is responding to multiple disease outbreaks, natural disasters, and humanitarian crisis.

Ethiopia is one of the African countries affected by both armed conflict and natural disasters (drought, disease outbreaks) including the ongoing meningitis outbreak. Although a relatively low CFR has been recorded for the meningitis outbreak, it is important that the necessary actions are implemented for its control and to prevent any deterioration. A mixed etiology (bacterial and viral) has been identified so far, yet the total number of samples analyzed is relatively low. More sample collection and analysis are needed to identify the dominant pathogen and request the appropriate vaccine for response.

[The highest burden of bacterial meningitis is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African Meningitis Belt, which includes 26 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, CÃ´te d'Ivoire/Ivory Coast, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, South Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda; https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-meningitis-belt-of-Africa-Map-highlights-26-countries-that-make-up-the-meningitis_fig1_321627150) from Senegal on the Atlantic Coast to Ethiopia in East Africa, where recurrent meningitis outbreaks, especially meningococcal meningitis, have recurred during the hot, dry season between December and June. In the African meningitis belt, meningococcus serogroup A accounted for 80-85% of meningitis epidemics before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine through mass preventive campaigns in 2010.

As of April 2021, 24 of the 26 countries in the meningitis belt have conducted mass preventive campaigns targeting 1-29 year olds (nationwide or in high-risk areas), and half of them have introduced this vaccine into their national routine immunization schedules. Among vaccinated populations, the incidence of serogroup A meningitis has declined by more than 99% -- no serogroup A case has been confirmed since 2017 (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/meningitis). However, there has been emergence of bacterial meningitis due to non-serogroup A pathogens e.g., _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups W, X, and C, _Haemophilus influenzae_ b, and _Streptococcus pneumoniae_.

The following is extracted from the WHO Meningitis Outbreak Response in Sub-Saharan Africa: WHO Guideline (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK274183/). For populations greater than 30 000, a meningitis epidemic is defined as crossing an alert threshold if there are 5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per week and an epidemic threshold if there are 10 suspected cases per 100 000 inhabitants per week. Epidemics are considered caused by a given pathogen when it is responsible for at least 50% of the confirmed cases. When the proportion of confirmed cases due to a single pathogen is lower than 50%, the epidemic is considered 'mixed'.

The overall case fatality ratio (CFR) of meningococcal disease is 10% to 15%, even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, and can be higher in persons with meningococcemia (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/mening.html).

The news report above says that 4 Ethiopia regions crossed the epidemic threshold and 5 regions crossed the alert threshold, with a mixed etiology (bacterial and viral) identified so far. The CFR has been low (0.9%), but the data are limited. More information would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources as the investigation proceeds.

Ethiopia (estimated population 118 million residents in 2021) is a landlocked country in the Horn of Africa, with Eritrea and Djibouti to the north, Somalia to the east and north east, Kenya to the south, South Sudan to the west, and Sudan to the north west (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia#mediaviewer/File:Ethiopia_zone_region.jpg). Ethiopia is divided into 11 ethnically based and politically autonomous regional states and 2 chartered cities; a map showing these regions can be found at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Map_of_zones_of_Ethiopia.svg. - Mod.ML
