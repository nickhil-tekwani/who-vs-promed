An apparent outbreak of disease has taken a toll on young
double-crested cormorants on Lake Vermilion's Potato Island [north
eastern Minnesota].

More than 50 of the young birds were found dead this week [week of 8
Aug 2010] by a tribal biologist, and others were found with symptoms
of neurological damage. The symptoms were similar to Newcastle
disease [ND], an avian [viral disease] that has taken a toll on
cormorant populations elsewhere in Minnesota, but DNR [Department of
Natural resources] wildlife veterinarian Erika Butler said the actual
cause of the bird deaths on Lake Vermilion likely won't be confirmed
for 2-3 weeks.

Newcastle disease mostly affects juvenile birds, and it has proven
particularly virulent among cormorant populations. The population of
cormorants on Lake Vermilion has increased sharply in recent years, a
development that has created concerns for anglers, who view the
cormorants as competitors for game fish. A total of 307 cormorant
nests were discovered on Potato Island earlier this year [2010], so
the deaths of 50 young birds is unlikely to have much impact on the
cormorant population. "It will slow down recruitment this year," said Butler.

[The western side of the state has recently had a suspected case of
NDV. Saskatchewan, Canada has had a recent suspect case as well. It
seems Newcastle disease virus may be moving through parts of the
northern US states and part of some of Canadian providences. Readers
are referred to ProMED-mail 20100807.2692 for more information on
this disease. - Mod.TG]
