[According to the report above, a total of 82 974 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, 3 new confirmed cases in the previous 24 hours (22 May 2020) and no new deaths. There is 1 indigenous case in Jilin province and 2 imported cases; 1 in Shanghai municipality and 1 in Guangdong province.

In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macao and Taiwan also reported no newly confirmed cases. There has been a total of 1713 imported cases reported, an increase of 2 cases since yesterday (22 May 2020).

There were 36 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours; 4 were imported cases, and the remaining 32 cases were locally acquired. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 371, and 28 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and then ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 25 cases with no new deaths compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (20 to 21 May 2020) when there were 23 newly confirmed cases and 4 deaths. A total of 11 190 confirmed cases and 266 deaths were reported today (23 May 2020), up from 11 165 cases and 266 deaths yesterday (22 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 50 consecutive days and below 50 for 43 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 15 days. In today's (24 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 17 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 8 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Gyeongbuk (6), Gyeonggi (5) cases, Seoul (4), Incheon (2) and Gyeongnam (1). Imported cases were in Quarantine (4), Seoul (2) and 1 each in Gangwon and Gyeonggi.

On the English language page, Notice: 331/332 of 24 May 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030) are graphs and tables showing the demographics of the cases and province-specific population-based rates. There is a mention that there has been a total of 1212 imported cases.

- From contact tracing on the confirmed student at Daegu Agriculture Meister High School, 5 more cases were confirmed (a pastor and church members at Elim church located in Gumi, Gyeongbuk Province). Epidemiological investigation and contact tracing are underway.
- From the confirmed emergency worker at Bucheon fire station in Gyeonggi Province, 3 more cases (family and coworkers) were confirmed, bringing the total number to 4 cases.
- As of 12:00 today [24 May 2020], there are 225 confirmed cases in total related to the nightclub cluster.
- (By region) Seoul City 106, Gyeonggi Province 58, Incheon City 40, Chungbuk Province 9, Busan City 4, Gyeongnam Province 2, Jeonbuk Province 2, Daejeon City 1, Chungnam Province 1, Gangwon Province 1, Jeju Province 1 (Of 9 cases from Chungbuk Province, 8 are related to a quarantine facility at the Ministry of National Defense)
- (By chain of transmission) Club visitors 96, Contacts (family, acquaintance, coworker, etc.) 129
- (By age group) [0-18] 26, [19-29] 122, 30-39] 35, [50-59] 19, [50-59]12, [60+] 11
- (By sex) male 178, female 47

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus. And the Korean CDC is encouraging no club, bars or karaoke visits.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 229 327 cases, including 32 735 deaths, up from 228 658 cases and 32 616 deaths reported on 22 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 22 and 23 May 2020 was 669 newly confirmed cases, compared with 652 newly confirmed cases between 21 and 22 May 2020. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are in a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 69.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 65.9% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the only province reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Fourteen provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), and another 5 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Piedmont was the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but fewer than 100).

There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces, where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of nonessential businesses. It is now 66 days since the start of the lockdown in the north and 65 days since the countrywide lockdown. The lockdown was extended through 3 May 2020 (see ProMED-mail post 20200411.7211958 for details). All eyes are now on Italy as lockdown restrictions are phased out.

59 people died of coronavirus in Iran over the past day, according to the Ministry of Health of Iran, APA reports. The coronavirus death toll in Iran has reached 7359. 1869 coronavirus cases were recorded over the past day, and in total, coronavirus cases have reached 133 521 in Iran so far. 104 072 people have recovered from coronavirus so far.

[In the 24 hours from 22 to 23 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 131 652 to 133 521 total cases, an increase of 1869 compared with 2311 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (22 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7300 to 7359, an increase of 59 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Brazil, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 23 May 2020 19:00 GMT).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature because daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2- to 3-week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. If there is heavy travel, there may be a significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the coming 2-4 weeks. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR-positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The cumulative antibody-confirmed cases are no longer available in the daily report and are only shown in the graphs. There were 361 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 446 in the preceding 24-hour period (from 21 to 22 May 2020), bringing the PCR-confirmed cumulative total to 235 290 cases as compared with 234 824 confirmed cases on 22 May 2020. Total death reports note 28 678 deaths reported as of today (23 May 2020) and 28 628 deaths reported as of 22 May 2020, an increase of 50 deaths in 24 hours. This is a major change from yesterday's [22 May 2020] report, and I wonder whether there is some reporting artefact in cumulative case counts.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 14.81, a continual slow decrease over the past 28 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 14.81 today (23 May 2020). Spain has the 2nd highest case count in Europe and is 4th globally behind the USA, Brazil and Russia in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 235 290 cases, an additional 125 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 13 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 10.4% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
