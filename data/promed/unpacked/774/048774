An outbreak of disease reported to be anthrax in Central Kupang, Indonesia
has killed at least 15 pigs and infected 25 others, the latter animals
successfully treated with "vitamins and penicillin". Laboratory tests on
blood and brain tissue samples are now being run. And officials have warned
residents not to eat meat from animals that die.

[Could our Indonesian colleagues clarify something for me? While anthrax is
commonly seen in pigs in SE Asia, why would "laboratory tests" need to be
run on "brain tissue"? I suspect there is more to this report than appears
here.
To preempt other comments I would also point out that it is most unwise to
eat any animal sick with anthrax, quite apart from those that have already
died of it. This is a very common cause of enteric anthrax, especially in
impoverished communities where there are religious scruples about butchering
and eating dead animals. Many an animal dying of anthrax has had its throat
cut so it can be eaten, unfortunately. - Mod.MHJ
