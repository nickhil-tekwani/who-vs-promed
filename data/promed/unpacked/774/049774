Fifty-five inhabitants of Sverdlovsk have been admitted to hospital with
the diagnosis of toxic hepatitis or poisoning with alcohol. Experts from
Rospotrebnadzor have noted that similar (and more severe) emergencies have
occurred in the Chelyabinsk area, where alcohol-containing liquid has
poisoned about 200 persons. Given these facts, the investigation is being
carried out by law enforcement bodies -- who will try to determine the
sources of this dangerous alcohol.
After the examination of samples by experts from Rospotrebnadzor, a
disinfectant alcohol-containing solution [methanol] that is not intended
for ingestion (but is freely available in pharmacies) has been found to be
the cause of the poisoning. An investigation is being carried out at all
points of sale of this and other alcohol-containing solutions.

Thirty-seven people are receiving treatment in the gastroenterology
department of Pskov city hospital with symptoms of severe poisoning with
toxic alcohol [methanol]. Five more people were placed in the pulmonology
branch and one person in the ICU. The physician on duty announced that one
of the patients died on 3 Oct 2006.
Patients did not feel ill immediately after consumption of the alcohol, but
symptoms developed gradually.
Now there are 88 patients being treated in the hospital, which is
constructed for 60 patients. In an interview with one of the news agencies
in the Pskov area, the Chairman of the Committee on licensing and wildlife
management, Vladimir Afanasyev, explained that despite attempts to control
the trade in ethyl spirits and alcohol containing-solutions, the situation
regarding poor-quality alcohol remains complex.

Hospitals in Chelyabinsk continue to admit patients who have been poisoned
by juniper alcohol intended for external application. A total of 414
patients with toxic hepatitis have applied for admission to the hospitals,
but only half of them have been admitted.
One 2-year-old child has been admitted to the hospital with his
parents. Medical insurance funds have been allocated for necessary
medications. The procurement of an 'artificial liver' device for treatment
of the poisonings is being discussed, supported by the municipal budget.
Similar cases of poisoning have been registered in city of Emanjelinsk and
other cities in the area.

Outbreaks in various cities in the Kursk region have been reported. There
are 112 affected people, 13 of whom are women. Seventy percent of the
cases are considered moderate; one case is stable but severe, and 35 people
have been discharged.
Many people purchased alcohol in half-liter plastic bottles in exchange for
potatoes or milk. Some people report that the alcohol came from the
neighboring Belgorod region.
Mr. Bunakov, a manager of Rospotrebnadzor, was told that operative tracking
in a daily mode has been organized to control the situation. Checks at
trading points and drugstores are being carried out. However, every day,
unfortunately, brings new cases of poisonings, which indicates that the
underground sale of the contaminated vodka has not yet been stopped.

[This problem appeared approximately one month ago. The number of reports
of poisonings and their geographical dispersion combine to form a picture
of a widespread medical-social problem in need of a rapid solution. The
state, families, employers, and society face huge losses. This problem
brings to light the inconsistencies of existing systems of manufacturing
and distribution of alcohol-containing liquids, state controls, healthcare,
and trade. - Corresp.VM]
[Methanol (wood alcohol) is produced from the destructive distillation of
wood. Epidemics of methanol toxicity have resulted from the consumption of
methanol-contaminated whiskey, for example. The formation of 2 toxic
metabolites, formaldehyde and formic acid, causes methanol poisoning. The
elimination rate depends upon the folate pool. In primates it is generally
small, and consequently primates (including humans) are more sensitive to
methanol toxicity than other animals.
Methanol is widely available in formulations including antifreeze,
windshield washer fluid, Sterno canned heat, shellacs, various paints,
paint removers, varnishes, duplicating fluids, and gasoline additives.
Fatalities have been reported after ingestion of 15 ml (or 3 teaspoons) of
a 40 percent solution, although 30 ml is generally considered a minimal
lethal dose. With aggressive medical care it is possible to survive the
ingestion of 500-600 ml. However, consumption of as little as 10 ml may
cause blindness, with the amount varying with the individual. Methanol is
well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and peak levels occur
generally within 30-90 minutes. It is distributed into tissues, so
concentrations in the vitreous humor and optic nerve are high. The highest
concentrations are found in the kidney, liver and gastrointestinal tract,
with smaller concentrations in the brain, muscle and adipose tissues.
Methanol is oxidized 10 times more slowly than ethanol. Consequently there
is a longer elimination half-life. Onset of symptoms varies between 40
minutes and 72 hours post-ingestion. Co-ingestion with alcohol will delay
the appearance of symptoms, but the absence of symptoms does not exclude
serious toxicity. The usual latent period is 12-24 hours.
Clinical signs may include headache, vertigo, lethargy and confusion, which
are common in mild to moderate ethanol intoxications. Coma and convulsions
appear in severe cases, probably as a result of cerebral edema. Methanol
produces little to no euphoria, unlike ethanol.
Blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and photophobia (sensitivity to
light) are common complaints. Constricted visual fields, fixed and dilated
pupils, retinal edema and hyperemia of the optic disk are common clinical
findings. Prompt initial therapy is necessary to reverse symptoms, though
visual defects have persisted in up to 25 per cent of severe cases.
Methanol is a mucosal irritant and may produce nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain, not unlike large doses of ethanol. Early in the clinical
course, gut decontamination with ipecac or lavage may be indicated.
However, if the methanol is mixed with ethanol, these patients may not
realize something is out of the ordinary until it is too late for this type
of treatment to be helpful.
Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10 percent dextrose solution may
be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the
treatment may take several days and the patient should be hospitalized.
Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well.
Another treatment is Fomepizole (4-methylpyrazole, Antizol), which inhibits
alcohol dehydrogenase and does not trigger delirium, fetal risks, liver
injury, gastropathy, or frequent vomiting. Also, Folinic acid (leucovorin)
is recommended for restoration of 1-carbon metabolism, especially for
methanol exposure. - Mod.TG]
