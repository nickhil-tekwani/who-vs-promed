The number of suspected cholera cases in the North has risen to 1120,
and 8 people have died of the waterborne disease, Oshana health
director Naftali Hamata said yesterday [13 Apr 2008].

Dr Hamata, who is also the Flood Emergency coordinator for Health in
the North, told The Namibian that the confirmed cases still stood at
16. The vast majority of cases, 1118, and 7 of the deaths were
reported in the Ohangwena Region, especially in the Engela health
district, which covers the Engela, Okatope, and Eenhana areas. Dr
Hamata said one child had died of cholera in the Kunene Region last
week and another case of the disease was also reported in that region.

The Ministry of Health yesterday [10 Apr 2008] issued a cholera
outbreak alert saying the disease had spread to more than 16
districts in 4 provinces. Worst affected regions include Nyanza,
Western, Rift Valley, and North Eastern provinces.

James Nyikal, the director of medical services, said the government
had consequently banned hawking, preparation, and eating of food in
public gatherings in the affected districts. He said the ministry had
also embarked on an aggressive public awareness campaign, enhanced
surveillance of water quality, including sources supplying
municipalities and cities.

Dr Nyikal said the ministry had intensified its inspection of eating
places along the northern corridor road, from Busia to Mombasa, and
urged the public to practice utmost cleanliness to avoid contacting
the disease.

Since the 1st case was identified in November 2007 in Suba district,
the number of cases has grown to 1217 resulting in 59 deaths. Cases
have been reported in Migori, Kisumu East, and Naivasha. Other
districts that had reported the epidemic, but where the disease is
now under control, include Homabay, Rongo, Kisii South, Bunyala, and
Mandera.

[5] Shigellosis - Israel (Tel Aviv)

Health officials report an alarming increase in the number of
toddlers infected with shigellosis, leading to dangerous symptoms,
including diarrhea, often bloody, fever, and stomach cramps. It is
most commonly found among toddlers not totally toilet trained and
nursing homes. Food can become contaminated by soiled fingers, caused
by the lack of proper hand washing, or from vegetables irrigated in
fields with sewage water [a practice unfortunately not uncommon in
some areas], or ingesting contaminated water. At times, the diarrhea
can become so serve that it demands hospitalization. Most of the
cases reported in Israel of late were found in the Greater Tel
Aviv/Sharon region.

[6] Cholera, diarrhea - Viet Nam (north and south)

Viet Nam, battling a cholera outbreak that has infected over 130
people, this week launches a month long public hygiene drive while
cracking down on dirty food stalls and dredging sewage-choked lakes.
The epidemic of the dangerous bacterial disease, the country's 3rd
major outbreak since October 2007, has spread in recent weeks from
its epicenter in Hanoi to southern Ho Chi Minh City and 16 provinces,
officials said.

No fatalities from the 3 outbreaks. Of 1335 acute diarrhea cases
reported since early March 2008, 136 patients, or about 10 percent,
have tested positive for cholera, deputy health minister Trinh Quan
Huan said, according to the main government website.

The disease has thrown a spotlight on often poor hygiene conditions
in Viet Nam's public spaces, including wet markets and street-side
restaurants where ground-level cooking areas are often situated
adjacent to toilets. Many farmers use fresh manure to fertilize
vegetables and polluted water to irrigate fields. At tens of
thousands of street-side food stalls, dishes and chopsticks are
commonly washed using soapy but cold water.

Public health officials say they suspect cholera has spread rapidly
along Viet Nam's north-south railway line, where many train carriages
have inadequate waste removal services and the toilets can be
forbidding places. "15 trains a day take 3000 passengers through 22
provinces," Huan said according to the Thanh Nien daily. "Only 100
out of 1000 carriages have sanitary waste collection. This is a huge
threat in spreading the germ."

City workers have already dumped over one tonne of chlorine into
central Hanoi's Linh Quang Lake and closed some restaurants and
street stalls along its shore after 6 people living nearby tested
positive for cholera.

Prefectural government officials said 10 people have been diagnosed
with food poisoning caused by a cholera outbreak after dining at a
restaurant in Saitama Prefecture. This is the 1st time that a cholera
case has been confirmed in Japan since an outbreak in Aomori
Prefecture in 2002, according to officials.

Those affected complained that they suffered diarrhea and nausea
after eating sashimi and other food at Shozaburo, a Japanese-style
restaurant in Kisai, Saitama Prefecture. 8 of them received treatment
and 3 were hospitalized. None are in a serious condition.

Marion County's shigella outbreak is now into its 6th month and
health officials are worried the highly contagious disease is going
to become more widespread because kids are coming back from spring
break. The health department learned of 16 new cases this week and 15
last week.

The most effective way to stop the spread of shigellosis is thorough
and frequent hand washing.
