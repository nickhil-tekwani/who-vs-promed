The 2nd case of hantavirus [infection] this year [2022] in Herrera province was confirmed by the health authorities, in a 64-year-old male patient, resident in the district of La Arena, in Chitré.

As was announced, the patient is hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Dr Gustavo Nelson Collado Ríos hospital, where he is under mechanical respiratory assistance, and in critical condition.

Luis Pérez, provincial health director, indicated that the patient presented initial symptoms such as respiratory distress, fever, and cough, for which he was first treated in the emergency room of the Dr Cecilio A Castillero hospital, in Chitré, and later transferred to Dr Gustavo Nelson hospital.

He added that the investigations that were carried out showed that the patient visited the Tonosí district, in the neighboring Los Santos province, where he periodically carries out agricultural work, an area in which most of the cases in this region of the country occur each year.

"We are investigating with relatives and neighbors to determine where he could have been infected," Pérez said. He added that the institution's teams visited the surroundings of the house, finding risk factors, that allow the presence of the mouse that transmits the disease.

Traps were also placed in the vicinity of the place to try to catch rodents and analyze them, while health promoters visited nearby houses to orient the population on measures to avoid contact with the transmitting vector.

Until now, Herrera province has 2 cases of hantavirus [infections this year (2022)], the 1st was a patient from the district of Pesé who unfortunately died shortly after.

[Although the patient became ill in Herrera province where he resides, he likely became infected with a hantavirus in the Tonosi district in Los Santos province where he was an occasional agricultural worker. Rural agricultural areas provide habitat for rodent reservoirs of Choclo hantavirus.

Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases, (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
