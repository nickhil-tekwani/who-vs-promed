CJD AND BLOOD DONORS (02)

The World Health Organization will recommend barring "groups of higher risk
of having Creutfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) from donating blood." The decision
is taken in the light of scientific evidence suggesting a link between BSE
and nvCJD.
"While experts determined they have no proof that CJD can be transmitted
via blood transfusions, they said there is a potential risk", according to
Financial Times (03/27/97)
Three groups have been identified as potential risk groups:
People treated with contaminated growth hormone early in the 1980s; people
who have had brain or other surgery in which duramater was used to patch
tissue; and families of CJD sufferers
----- Now, consider this:
* In the perspective of a potentially huge BSE exposure to humans in the
UK, mostly during the 80's
* That nvCJD may have a general incubation period of several decades
* And that the blood supply in the UK and elsewhere are not screened for CJD
*** I suggest that all blood products from the UK should be recognized by
the international community as potentially risky. At least until a
satisfying test can be used to identify the infectious agent in blood
products.
*** There is currently "no proof that CJD can be transmitted via blood
transfusions", but there is a "potential risk".
Therefore, I also suggest that bovine blood, as well as beef products
including blood, should be recognized as potentially risky. Especially
bovine blood and beef products from countries with high BSE numbers.
