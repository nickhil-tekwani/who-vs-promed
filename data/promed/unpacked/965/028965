Vladimir Semenov, the Minister of Heath of Moscow region, reported
about confirmation of 3 poliomyelitis cases in children in the oblast
who came from Tajikistan. He said that these children were
hospitalized after the national head sanitary doctor required
universal referral of all under 6-year-old children ex Tajikistan.
According to him, 12 children up to 6 years old have been
hospitalized in hospitals of Moscow oblast as of 17 May 2010.
Meanwhile, about 400 cases of poliomyelitis had been registered in
Tajikistan so far, including 15 fatalities.

Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Agency for Protection of Customer
Rights and Human Welfare] is controlling arrivals of airplanes and
trains since the end of April [2010] and at the beginning of May
[2010] it introduced ban on imported dried fruits from Tajikistan.
Beginning [6 May 2010] the entry of children up to 6 years old from
Tajikistan is prohibited. This restriction will be in effect until
the situation is under control or complete immunization of all
children under 6 in Tajikistan is accomplished. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO) about 1.5 million people or 1 percent
of the total population in Russia are not immunized against
poliomyelitis. 20 000 Tajik nationals currently reside in Moscow
oblast including 124 under 15-year-old children.

[According to the polio eradication website, as of 18 May 2010, there
have been 108 cases of polio confirmed in Tajikistan, with the date
of onset of last confirmed case on 18 Apr 2010 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp> for global and by
country case counts). This is in contrast with the 89 confirmed cases
reported in the above newswire. This represents an almost doubling of
confirmed cases in the past week, when 56 confirmed cases were
reported (see Poliomyelitis - worldwide (09): Russia ex Tajikistan
20100514.1575).

While the newswires are now reporting 3 confirmed cases of polio in
Tajik nationals hospitalized in Russian hospitals, as of 18 May 2010,
there have not been any confirmed cases of polio in Russia that have
been reported officially (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp> for officially confirmed cases.
