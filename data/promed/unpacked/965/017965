Hong Kong officials said they were more confident about the possibility that pet hamsters are spreading COVID in the city as newly uncovered infections are genetically distinct from the virus initially found in a pet shop clerk.

A female customer who tested positive after visiting the store has a strain that's slightly different from the virus found in the 23-year-old index patient, an employee at the Little Boss pet shop. [The difference is] based on 4 small variations in its genetic code. The customer's husband, who also tested positive for COVID, has the same strain, health officials said in a Thursday [20 Jan 2022] briefing.

It would make sense for the suspected hamsters to be the original source, according to the officials, since they could have carried different strains of virus when they were imported. They could each then pass on a slightly different version to humans, creating multiple transmission chains. Already more than 2000 of the small pets, including rabbits and chinchillas, were ordered culled.

In addition to the genetic results, more infections emerged in people who had exposure to hamsters and pet shops. A 30-year-old who purchased a hamster at Little Boss tested positive after arriving in a quarantine facility. A customer who visited an I Love Rabbit pet shop in a different part of town tested preliminarily positive, while a hamster cage in yet another I Love Rabbit location also was harboring the virus. I Love Rabbit is part of the same business group as Little Boss.

The pet shop infections were all caused by the delta variant, though some had slight genetic changes. The city confirmed one additional, untraceable infection with delta in a 17-year-old male student. The teenager is carrying a different form of the virus than the other delta patients, doesn't have pets, and hasn't recently visited a pet shop.

Officials suspect he could have gotten it from someone previously infected by animals, with an unknown chain of transmission.

"The likelihood of animal spread to human increased a lot," health official Chuang Shuk-kwan said at the briefing, pointing out that the virus is nearly identical when it spreads from one human to another. She urged residents to not hesitate to turn in their hamsters for culling, or else risk endangering public health.

Before the pet shop flare-up, the city has been battling an outbreak of the omicron variant in the community. Delta's arrival came as a shock because the Asian financial hub fended it off in 2021, making it one of the only places in the world to avoid an outbreak with the virulent variant.

The hamster probe is part of Hong Kong's commitment to a COVID Zero policy that aims to eradicate the virus within its borders. The government is drilling down deeply, trying to track every case. The effort includes a report about one person who may have contracted the virus when passing someone who was infected in a subway tunnel for 9 seconds, even though both were wearing masks and they were walking in opposite directions.

The city reported 10 local cases Thursday [20 Jan 2022]. Officials said there are about 20 preliminary infections, with many being local cases.

The authorities will halt in-person secondary school classes starting on Monday [24 Jan 2022], following the closure of primary schools and kindergartens last week. A handful of confirmed and preliminary cases reported Thursday [20 Jan 2022] involved students.

[ProMED thanks John Klopfer for the submission of the above report and for a link to a press release of the Hong Kong University (HKU) (see further).

This event was officially reported to the OIE on 21 Jan 2022. The OIE report addressed 2 outbreaks involving hamsters:
1. A pet shop in Causeway Bay, Wan Chai. Event started 17 Jan, ended 18 Jan 2022, involving 69 susceptible Cricetidae-Rodentia, 7 cases, all 69 culled.
2. Warehouse stores of small mammals at Tai po (supplying the animals to 35 pet shops selling hamsters in Hong Kong, including the pet shop in Causeway Bay where a staff member had been diagnosed with COVID-19). Event started 17 Jan, ended 19 Jan 2022, involving 863 susceptible animals, 1 case, all culled.

For each outbreak, the report included descriptions of the affected animal population and epidemiological comments. (See ProMED post 20220122.8701017.)

The HKU press release, dated 22 Jan 2022, is titled "Response of Prof Yuen Kwok-yung, Department of Microbiology, University of Hong Kong, about the scientific considerations on possible SARS-CoV-2 transmission by hamsters." The response, signed by Prof Yuen (http://www.microbiology.hku.hk/02_HKU_Staff_Prof_KY_Yuen.html), includes complementary information and clarifications, mainly presented in 15 questions/answers. The introduction, the text of Q/A No. 4 and 13, and conclusive comment follow:

a. Introduction:
"On 18 Jan 2022, the Dept of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation [DAFC] announced emergency action to humanely dispose of approximately 2000 hamsters in order to stop the spread of the delta variant of the virus, which could be transmitted to humans through hamsters. Hamsters are the favorite pets of many people. I can understand the sadness of animal lovers. However, in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic, I and other government experts, including Professor Leung Cheuk-wai and Professor Xu Shuchang, agree with the difficult decision of the relevant departments. I answer some questions about hamsters below."

b. Questions and answers:
"Q 4. If there is no direct evidence, why do you say 'there are good reasons to believe that the virus carried by hamsters is likely to spread to humans'?
A 4. Animal and environmental samples from the store, particularly from hamsters, also tested positive.
1. A similar non-native European delta variant was detected in the Tai Po warehouse, which was the virus detected in animal cages, suggesting that the virus may have been imported from the Netherlands through hamsters, and the AFCD is sampling for further investigation.
2. The virus was detected in environmental samples and more than 10% of the hamsters in the Causeway Bay pet store.
3. A Little Boss pet store staff member and a pet store customer were infected who never visited the warehouse.
4. The 2 positive cases initially confirmed on [20 Jan 2022] were related to hamsters.

"Therefore, we have reason to suspect that the warehouse with more than 1000 hamsters is the source of the virus, and the virus can expand through cross-infection and spread to pet stores and many other retail establishments, further expand everywhere, and infect humans."

"Q 13. Why is the government taking urgent action?
A 13. We need urgent decisions and actions to prevent possible spread. According to the available information, the virus has already begun to spread in Little Boss warehouses and pet stores in Tai Po, and many other pet stores may be at risk of transmission. We are racing against time. Time does not allow us to wait for further genomic information to act. Therefore, we cannot but sacrifice imported hamsters in Tai Po warehouses and retail stores to ensure the safety of the community and prevent the possibility of the spread of the delta virus transmitted by hamsters.

"Let's synthesize what we know now:
1. The virus was detected in the Tai Po warehouse where hamsters were once stored.
2. In the 1st round of screening, more than 10% of the hamsters in the Little Boss pet store had the virus.
3. The staff is first diagnosed, and then the customer is diagnosed.
4. The person diagnosed in the hamster group has not been to the warehouse.

"Then the biggest possibility is that people in the Netherlands or Hong Kong passed the virus to the hamsters in the warehouse, and then the infected hamsters were cross-infected in the pet store to expand the virus and spread it to humans."

c. Conclusive comment:
"Dr. Xiao Jieheng from the Polytechnic University performed the relevant genome sequencing and shared the results with us. While science and medicine cannot solve the problem of love, we need the help of other professionals, such as psychologists, counselors, and bereavement counsellors, to help the public cope with emotional crises. Scientists are ignorant of the pathogenicity and infectivity of the delta mutant virus that just emerged in Hong Kong. They are redoubling their efforts to find out. We also need the understanding and support of society."

To assess the significance of the described tests leading to the policy applied, results of further studies, in particular the comparative sequencing data of recent Dutch, HK, and mainland China's SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) from animal and man, are anticipated.

The regulation and certification of international trade in pet, laboratory, and wild animals deserves to be visited. - Mod.AS
