An invasive mosquito species _Aedes albopictus_ found in the Czech Republic, 2012
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Authors: Sebesta O, Rudolf I, Betasova L, Pesko J, Hubalek Z]

Between July-September 2012, 17 larvae of the invasive mosquito species _Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus_ (Skuse) were discovered using 60 ovitraps at 4 study sites alongside 2 main road exits in South Moravia, Czech Republic. This is the 1st report of imported _Ae. albopictus_ in the Czech Republic. The findings highlight the need for a regular surveillance programme to monitor this invasive species throughout western and central Europe.

Background
----------
Of the invasive mosquitoes discovered in Europe recently, the Asian tiger mosquito _Aedes albopictus_ (Skuse) represents the major threat to public health. Historically, this species originated in South-East Asia, but it has spread to the Americas, parts of Africa, northern Australia, and 19 European countries (Albania, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, San Marino, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Vatican City State) during the last decades. The species is now widely established and reportedly a nuisance mosquito in Italy, parts of France, and Spain. _Ae. albopictus_ is globally an important vector of human pathogens such as chikungunya and dengue viruses as well as filarial nematodes represented by _Dirofilaria_ spp., and an experimentally proven vector of eastern equine encephalitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, La Crosse encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and several other viruses.

Its eggs are frequently transported via used tire trade or by importation of lucky bamboo. However, the most important mode of long-distance dispersal of _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe in the last decade seems to be transportation by ground vehicles (that is, lorries, cars, caravans) from southern Europe.

While 2 frequently used main roads connecting the Czech Republic with southern European countries cross the border in South Moravia, no systematic surveillance of invasive mosquito species has been conducted until present. This led us to periodically monitor invasive mosquito species at this so-called 'Moravian entrance gate' using ovitrap installations.

Conclusion
----------
South Moravia is owing to its mild climate the most favourable habitat for breeding of mosquitoes within the Czech Republic. Massive broods of mosquitoes (predominantly _Aedes_ spp.) periodically occur here along the rivers Dyje and Morava. This area has been known for a long time as a natural focus of several mosquito-borne viruses: mainly Tahyna virus, the etiologic agent of Valtice fever, and since 1997 also West Nile virus lineage 3 -- Rabensburg. Many mosquito species occurring in the Czech Republic were only recorded in this region. We should take this region into consideration when searching for a suitable habitat for possible introduction and subsequent establishment of invasive mosquito species in central Europe. Our findings suggest that _Ae. albopictus_ may be able to complete its developmental cycle in this region, and in case of a mild winter might also survive in the stadium of eggs. Our results also indicate that ovitraps are a suitable tool for monitoring invasive mosquitoes on parking lots alongside main roads where alternative egg depositing water is likely less available.

In conclusion, we provide the 1st evidence of import of _Ae. albopictus_ in the Czech Republic. Interestingly, _Ae. albopictus_ has not yet been reported from the neighbouring central-European countries Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, or Poland.

[This interesting observation is yet another example of the steady spread of _Ae. albopictus_ in Europe. There is no reason to think that this mosquito's European geographic range will halt in the Czech Republic. Predictions have indicated considerable spread into areas in Europe where it is not found currently. Once established and abundant, the risk of introduction and ongoing transmission of pathogens such as chikungunya and dengue viruses becomes real, as was the situation when a chikungunya virus outbreak occurred in Italy in 2007.
