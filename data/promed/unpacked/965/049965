Plant-health emergency issued due to dangerous crop pests
---------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture Minister Javier Flores Galarza announced that the Costa
Rican government has issued a national and local phytosanitary
emergency in order to deal with 2 dangerous pests that are currently
affecting crops in various parts of the country and threatening to
spread even further.

A 1st local emergency decree was issued for the Southern Zone cantons
of Perez Zeledon and Buenos Aires, and for the Northern Zone cantons
of San Carlos and Los Chiles, due to the presence of orange rot or
sugar cane rot, a fungus that attacks sugarcane plantations.

"In this case, the state of emergency has been issued for a year, to
be extended until this disease is controlled or the problem has been
satisfactorily solved," Minister Flores Galarza explained.

The 2nd emergency is national in scope and will be in effect for the
next 2 years, as a result of the appearance of an insect pest known
as melon thrips (_Thrips palmi_ Karny), which was detected by
officials with the State Plant Health Service (SFE) in a green bean
sample from the community of Canas Gordas, district of Agua Buena, in
the Southern Zone canton of Coto Brus (near the border with Panama).
The situation requires adequate control of this pest, which would
threaten production of flowers, forages, vegetables, and large melon
farms for export.

[The terms orange rot and cane rot are not commonly used for any
sugarcane disease. The disease referred to above is most likely red
rot caused by the fungus _Glomerella tucumanensis_. It occurs in
most cane growing countries, but continues to be a threat in a number
of regions. Symptoms are highly variable depending on the host
variety and environmental conditions and may include discolouration,
red streaks, lesions, and drooping of young leaves. Plants die within
4 to 8 days. Stalks show a characteristic dull red internal
discolouration. The pathogen can be spread by wind, water, infected
plant material, and spores may survive in the soil. Disease
management includes clean planting material, phytosanitary and
cultural methods, and use of resistant crop varieties. For more
information on red rot see ProMED-mail post no. 20080201.0401.

The melon thrips, _T. palmi_, can do serious damage to range of crops
especially cucurbits and solanaceous vegetable and can even kill the
plants. Furthermore, it is the vector for several viruses in the
genus _Tospovirus_, including _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV),
_Capsicum chlorosis virus_, _Melon yellow spot virus_, _Groundnut bud
necrosis virus_, _Watermelon silver mottle virus_, _Watermelon bud
necrosis virus_, and the new Tomato zonate spot virus. These viruses
are economically important both in glasshouse and tropical field
production of their crop hosts, and the risk of an outbreak of these
viruses in Costa Rica is vastly increased by the presence of their
vector in the region.
