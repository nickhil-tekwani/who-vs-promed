7 people infected with a rare _Salmonella_ with a DNA profile that has never been seen in Norway. The samples of the patients were taken at the end of August 2017, and all are thought to be infected in Norway. Bacteria with similar DNA profiles have been detected in all 7 people, says senior adviser Heidi Lange at the Public Health Institute in a press release. The people who are infected are between 19 and 60 years old. 2 people live in Finnmark, but also people from Møre og Romsdal, Sogn og Fjordane, Akershus, and Oslo are infected. The DNA profile of the bacterium has never been seen before in Norway, either in humans, animals, or in foods.

There are no symptoms beyond what we usually see, such as diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. So it does not look like this is more serious," says Director of [Department of Food, Water and Animal Infection, Norwegian Institute of Public Health], Line Vold, to NRK. "Now we are working on common routines for outbreaks. We have a little work to do to get out and we know this is work that can take time," she says. The institute will cooperate with the municipal health service, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Veterinary Institute to investigate whether patients can have a common source of infection. Interviews are conducted with the patients and samples are taken from the homes.

"When they have a common DNA profile, it is an indication of a common source of infection. Then we can see if we have a source, for example, to be removed from the market if it is a food product," said Line Vold.

In order to avoid transmitting infections to others, she encourages people with diarrhea to take care of the washing hands after toilet visits and before cooking.

The bacterium is a rare variant of the bacterium _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype Typhimurium, which causes gastrointestinal inflammation, fever, and bloody stools and mucus.
