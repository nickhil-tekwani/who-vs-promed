Noxious fumes from fermented squid may have killed Koreans
-------------------------------------------------
The noxious fumes of fermented squid intestines on a ship that ran into a
breakwater in Japan on Sunday may have caused the deaths of 3 of the 4 South
Koreans aboard, the Japan Coast Guard said Tuesday.
The 115-ton South Korean squid transport ship Dong Woo probably ran into
the breakwater at a port in Oda, Shimane Prefecture, when the crew became
unable to operate it after suffering an oxygen deficiency due to the
fermented squid intestines the vessel was carrying, coast guard officials
said.

[This article does not give any details other than oxygen deprivation.
However, fermentation of certain organic material may mean decay. Although I
am not familiar with the uses of fermented squid intestines, I would suggest
that it was a case of decay in the hold of ship without circulation of
oxygen, and hence, release of hydrogen sulfide gas. - Mod.TG]
