2 Egyptian children have tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu
virus, bringing the total number of human cases of this disease in
the most populous Arab country to 29, Egypt's Health Ministry
announced on Tuesday [27 Mar 2007].
"There are 2 new cases of bird flu," Amr Kandeel, Head of
Communicable Disease Control at the Health Ministry, told Reuters.
"It is from exposure to dead birds."
The Health Ministry reported that the 5- and 6-year old children had
tested positive on Monday [26 Mar 2007] after being admitted to
hospital suffering from high fevers. They were in stable condition,
Kandeel said.
13 Egyptians have died from bird flu since it first surfaced in the
country's poultry a year ago [2006]. Most of those who fell ill were
reported to have had contact with sick or dead household birds,
primarily in northern Egypt. Egypt has the largest number of
confirmed human bird flu cases outside Asia.

A teenager and a 22-year-old woman have died from suspected bird flu
in Indonesia, a Health Ministry official today said today [27 Mar
2007]. Both had tested positive for the H5N1 virus after an initial
test, but officials were awaiting the result of a 2nd test.
Indonesia has the world's highest human death toll from bird flu and,
if confirmed by the 2nd test, the latest 2 deaths would take
Indonesia's confirmed human death toll from the virus to 68.
A 15-year-old boy from Indramayu in West Java died yesterday [26 Mar
2007], after falling ill on 16 Mar 2007 and receiving treatment in
several hospitals, Muhammad Nadirin at the Health Ministry's bird flu
centre said by telephone.
The 22-year-old woman from Palembang in southeast Sumatra died on 24
Mar 2007. The Antara state news agency reported that she had not had
contact with fowl, but that there were at least 10 cats at her house.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has warned that cats
should be kept away from areas affected by bird flu as they can pick
up and spread the disease.
An initial test also showed that a 39-year-old man from Mojokerto in
East Java was suffering from the H5N1 virus, Nadirin said. He was
being treated at the Soetomo Hospital in the city of Surabaya.

[Egypt and Indonesia continue to be the only 2 countries still
regularly reporting human cases of avian H5N1 influenza virus
infection. None of the recent cases in Indonesia appear to be linked.
One of the 2 latest cases reported from Egypt contracted infection in
a central province as distinct from the earlier cases, which
originated predominantly in the north and more recently in the south
of the country. - Mod.CP]
