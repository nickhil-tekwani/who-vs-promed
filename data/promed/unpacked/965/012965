A story from the deserts of the Middle East during the first Gulf War could potentially end with a cure for Alzheimer's disease.

Dr. Aspa D. Chatziefthimiou, a microbial ecologist and research scientist at Weill Cornell Medicine - Qatar (WCM-Q), is part of an international consortium of more than 50 scientists researching neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and ALS (also known as motor neuron disease or Lou Gehrig's disease). She is examining the role of desert cyanobacteria -- also called blue-green algae -- and how the neurotoxins they produce may be at least partly responsible for the onset of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

The possibility that desert toxins may have a role was first noticed in the decade following the first Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait.

Dr. Chatziefthimiou explained: "It was found that the US military personnel who were deployed in the first Gulf War had 3 times the incidence of ALS compared to their colleagues with the same training but who were not deployed to the Gulf. These soldiers trained together in the US and had similar backgrounds and experiences. The hypothesis was what caused the subsequent disease was the inhalation of dust particles in the desert. These personnel were following military vehicles in the desert which were physically disturbing biocrusts containing cyanobacteria and the toxins they produce and aerosolizing them."

The interest in cyanobacteria as a potential cause of neurodegenerative disease was originally sparked by ethnobotanist Dr. Paul Cox, the executive director of Brain Chemistry Labs, a not-for-profit research center based in Wyoming.

Dr. Cox and his colleague Dr. Sandra Banack discovered that local villagers on the Pacific island of Guam had a high rate of neurodegenerative disorders because of their predilection for eating native fruit bats. The bats were eating the seeds of the cycad tree, and a toxin in the seeds called BMAA (beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine) was accumulating in the tissues of the bat. The toxin itself was produced by cyanobacteria found in the roots of the cycad trees.

BMAA damages neurons in a number of ways and so is thought to cause brain disorders like Alzheimer's. While searching for ways to block the neurotoxin, Dr. Cox and colleagues found the commonly occurring amino acid L-serine not only blocked BMAA but was also neuro-protective. They are now investigating, through FDA-approved human clinical trials, whether L-serine could prove to be a therapy for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.

Dr. Chatziefthimiou said: "We now know BMAA is one causative factor for neurodegenerative diseases; it's one of multiple stressors. We have found L-serine offers neuroprotection, and we believe it can slow down the progression of disease."

[Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common human progressive neurodegenerative disorder causing dementia. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, massive deposition of amyloid beta peptide as senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are 3 neuropathological hallmarks of AD. Amyloid plaques have been observed in the brain of non-human primates, domestic dogs, cats, leopards, cheetahs, dolphins, and also in a coyote, a polar bear, an American black bear, a wolverine, a Bactrian camel, a degu, and a California sea lion. However, the clinical significance and consequences of the detected lesions on cognitive function in non-human animals are poorly documented, except for a few cases in geriatric dogs and cats, where a correlation between cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's-like pathology has been established. However, this article appears to be observing/treating human patients who have apparently acquired the cyanotoxin in a more natural fashion.

Chronic dietary exposure to the cyanobacterial toxin beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) in humans was found to trigger the formation of both NFT and beta-amyloid deposits. Amyloid plaques and NFTs have been detected in the brain parenchyma and in the neurons of stranded species of dolphins. The finding reported here suggests a link between BMAA exposure and Alzheimer's-like lesions.

The findings here seem to offer hope regarding some of these tragic diseases. However, it likely still a ways off to put this into a cure, but perhaps closer to put it into a prevention scheme. We hope these positive moves can improve/reverse the degenerative nature of this disease sooner rather than later. - Mod.TG
