The species of the bat found positive for EBLV-2 on 30 Jun 2022, provisionally determined as Brandt's bat was definitely identified as _Myotis daubentonii_by Dr Tommy Andriollo, Muséum d'histoire naturelle, Genève. This is in accordance with the previous 3 cases of EBLV-2 found in Switzerland so far in this 2nd reservoir species of bat rabies in Western Europe.

[Special thanks to Dr Zanoni for notifying us that the bat species involved in this case turned out to be a Daubenton's bat. Most reports of EBLV-2 correspond to Daubenton's bats (_Myotis daubentonii_), suggesting that this bat species is the reservoir of this lyssavirus strain. - Mod.PMB
