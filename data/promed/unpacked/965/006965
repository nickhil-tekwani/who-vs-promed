Cash for Camel Deaths
---------------------
Custodian of the 2 Holy Mosques King Abdullah has ordered the payment
of SR20 000 [5340.60 USD] per animal to the owners of camels that
died after eating toxic feed, Interior Minister Prince Naif announced
yesterday [Wed 9 Jan 2008].
Prince Naif commended the king's humanitarian gesture and said the
financial assistance would alleviate the difficulties of many
citizens in various parts of the Kingdom who had lost their camels.
According to press reports, nearly 5000 camels and other animals died
in various parts of the Kingdom. Agriculture Minister Dr. Fahd
Balghunaim consistently ruled out claims that the deaths were caused
by an infectious disease.
Tests conducted on the dead animals showed that toxins in animal feed
rather than any contagious disease were to blame for the deaths. The
tests were conducted in laboratories both inside and outside Saudi
Arabia.
"The tests were carried out on samples taken from dead animals and
suspicious feed as well as on pesticides, cyanides, nitrates, urea
and phenol, and radioactive materials," the ministry said. "The
results showed that the samples contained salinomycin, a compound to
which camels are highly allergic. Laboratory tests showed that the
bran used to feed camels contained high concentrations of this
compound," the ministry said.
Another toxic substance found in large quantities in the feed was
_Aspergillus clavatus_, which is a fungus.

[Defining _Aspergillus clavatus_ as a "toxic substance" by itself is
inaccurate; in fact, _Aspergillus clavatus_ is a commonly encountered
fungus in the environment, producing a number of mycotoxins including
patulin, kojic acid, cytochalasins and tremorgenic mycotoxins.
This exceptionally large mass-intoxication event, initially
characterised by lack of transparency, has now reached its final
stage since the Saudi authorities seem to have officially made known
that the causative agent was -- as suspected -- salinomycin, an
ionophoric coccidiostat which should not have been included in camel
feed. Subsequently, a (rather generous) compensation will be paid to
the affected animal owners. Hopefully, the Saudi authorities have
also taken the required steps to improve the State control upon the
manufacture, storage and distribution of animal feeds.
Internationally, the control upon safety and quality of animal feed
is addressed by two UN agencies, namely the FAO and WHO, mainly
within the framework of the Codex Alimentarius. - Mod.AS]
