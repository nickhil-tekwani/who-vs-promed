After appearing to have taken the upper hand on the bird-killing Newcastle disease outbreak in Southern California, officials this month [December 2018] announced a commercial chicken flock in Riverside county had been infected and that mandatory euthanasia operations have expanded to include Riverside county's greater Perris area.

Since the outbreak of the virus in mid-May [2018], about 60 000 birds -- mostly chickens -- have been euthanized, according to Steve Lyle, spokesman for the California Department of Agriculture. Until this month [December 2018], the infected chickens were nearly all backyard show birds.

Virulent Newcastle disease is deadly and highly contagious among birds, but is not a food-safety problem, according to the US Department of Agriculture's [USDA] 15 Dec 2018 news release on the infection of the commercial flock. "No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products," according to the USDA. "Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected. Symptoms are usually very mild and limited to conjunctivitis and/or influenza-like symptoms."

Lyle said all the chickens at the operation were euthanized but referred additional questions regarding that flock to the USDA. USDA spokeswoman Lyndsay Cole said that in such cases, her agency does not identify the business affected or its exact location. It is the 1st recorded case of Newcastle disease in commercial poultry since 2003.

Viral flare-up
--------------
As of mid-November [2018], the outbreak had been eradicated from 9 areas in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Ventura counties. That left 3 areas with mandatory euthanasia orders: Compton in Los Angeles county, Muscoy in San Bernardino county and in the Mira Loma area of Jurupa Valley in Riverside county. At that time, about 54 000 birds had been euthanized.

Those 3 areas continue under mandatory euthanasia orders, with Perris added to during the week of 7 Dec 2018. After the last birds are euthanized in an area, it must remain free of infected birds for at least 4 months before the orders are lifted.

Virulent Newcastle disease, formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, affects nearly all species of birds, according to the USDA. There is no cure, vaccinated birds can be infected, and birds can die without displaying symptoms. Symptoms, when exhibited, can include sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge, coughing, greenish diarrhea, tremors, and swelling around the eyes and neck.

The USDA recommends bird owners avoid visits to other poultry farms or bird owners during an outbreak. Those who do make visits should change clothes and clean their hands and shoes before entering their own bird area. Birds returning from shows should be isolated from other birds for 30 days. New birds should also be separated from other birds for at least 30 days. Egg trays, crates, vehicles ,and tires should be disinfected.

Owners who believe their birds may be infected should call the CDFA [California Department of Food and Agriculture] sick bird hotline at 866-922-2473.

2003 outbreak
-------------
The current outbreak is relatively small compared with the last rash of cases in the state. In 2002 and 2003, nearly 4 million birds on 2500 premises were euthanized, according to Lyle. That included 22 commercial poultry operations.

"No one wants their birds euthanized," Lyle told the Southern California News Group last month [November 2018]. "In fact, we don't like the idea of euthanizing birds at all, but we know scientifically this is the only option to stop the spread of the virus and eradicate the disease. Most residents understand what we're all up against when we share specific information with them, particularly if they have seen what this virus does to poultry. It is a highly contagious killer of poultry."

An outbreak of the bird-killing Newcastle disease has resulted in nearly 54 000 birds -- mostly chickens -- being euthanized in the greater Los Angeles area, with mandatory euthanasia operations ongoing in 3 areas. Efforts continue in neighborhoods in Compton in Los Angeles county, Muscoy in San Bernardino county and in the Mira Loma area of Jurupa Valley in Riverside county. The disease, first identified by officials in mid-May [2018], has been eradicated from 8 other areas in those 3 counties as well as Ventura county.

"In rare cases, humans that have exposure to infected birds may get eye inflammation or mild fever-like symptoms," according to the California Department of Food and Agriculture's disease alert. "These signs generally resolve without treatment; however medical care should be sought if clinical signs persist. "No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat."

Common questions about the disease:
1. How does the problem compare to previous outbreaks?
The current outbreak is relatively small compared with the last rash of cases in the state. In 2002 and 2003, nearly 4 million birds on 2500 premises were euthanized, according to Steve Lyle of the California Department of Food and Agriculture. That included 22 commercial poultry operations.

"The vast majority of the birds euthanized have been backyard chickens," Lyle said. "Additional types of birds having been euthanized include several hundred pigeons, several dozen doves, a few turkeys, and 4 geese."

2. How is Newcastle disease spread?
Healthy birds can become infected when they come in direct contact with bodily fluids from sick birds.

"The virus can travel on manure, egg flats, crates, other farming materials or equipment, and people who have picked up the virus on their clothing, shoes or hands," according to the USDA.

What are the signs displayed in birds?

Sudden death, sneezing, gasping for air, nasal discharge, coughing, greenish diarrhea, tremors, and swelling around the eyes and neck.

3. How can it be prevented?
The USDA recommends bird owners avoid visits to other poultry farms or bird owners. Those who do make visits should change clothes and clean their hands and shoes before entering their own bird area.

Birds returning from shows should be isolated from other birds for 30 days. New birds should also be separated from other birds for at least 30 days. Egg trays, crates, vehicles, and tires should be disinfected.

Sick birds -- as well birds in the areas with mandatory euthanasia -- should be reported immediately to the CDFA at 866-922-2473 or the USDA at 866-536-7593.

4. How are bird locations identified in the areas with mandatory euthanasia?
"We survey neighborhoods and knock on doors," Lyle said. "Nearly 110 000 homes have been reached by personal contact by CDFA and USDA staff since May [2018]."

5. What is the response from bird owners?
"No one wants their birds euthanized," Lyle said. "In fact, we don't like the idea of euthanizing birds at all, but we know scientifically that this is the only option that will stop the spread of the virus and eradicate the disease. Most residents understand what we're all up against when we share specific information with them, particularly if they have seen what this virus does to poultry. It is a highly contagious killer of poultry."

6. How are the birds handled after they are euthanized?
They are then triple bagged and disposed of in "a landfill under specific criteria and CDFA [California Department of Food and Agriculture] oversight," Lyle said.

7. When is the outbreak expected to be eradicated?
"We will be working for a minimum of 4 months after the last birds are euthanized to ensure properties remain fallow -- free from birds," Lyle said. "If a positive case is found during that time, the minimum 4-month clock starts anew."

[Certainly, the outbreak in 2002-3 was quite large. It also started in backyard flocks and moved into commercial flocks. Hopefully this commercial flock will be contained quickly and will not spread to other flocks. We would like to see this disease in commercial an backyard flocks contained sooner rather than later. - Mod.TG
