- Cases in children. 19 Mar 2019. (reported) Researchers assessed data from children who met the case definition for confirmed or probable ZIKV infection with symptom onset beginning between 2016 and 2017. All children (n = 141) were aged younger than 18 years and resided in California, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas or Virginia.
Most children infected were aged 12 to 17 years (64%), followed by children aged 5 to 11 years (30%) and children aged 1 to 4 years (5%). One child was aged younger than 1 year. Nearly all children (99%) were infected with ZIKV while traveling to a country or territory outside the U.S. Lindsey and colleagues said Mexico (n = 28), the Dominican Republic (n = 26) and Puerto Rico (n = 22) were the most commonly travel destinations. There were 2 children infected in Texas by mosquito transmission, they said. According to the researchers, 89% (n = 125) of children had lab-confirmed ZIKV infection.

The researchers observed no neurologic signs or symptoms of ZIKV infection in children. The most commonly reported clinical signs and symptoms were rash (94%), fever (74%), arthralgia (48%) and conjunctivitis (51%). The rashes were most often maculopapular, and about half were pruritic. Most children (87%) had 2 or more signs or symptoms, with 70% reporting fever and rash. More than half of the children had 3 or more signs and symptoms, and 18% had 4.

Thailand. 27 Feb 2019. (published) The study assessed the long-term circulation of Zika virus in Thailand. The spatial and age distribution of cases were analyzed, and constructed time-resolved phylogenetic trees using genomes from Thailand and elsewhere to estimate when Zika virus was 1st introduced. Of the 3089 samples from 1717 symptomatic individuals tested between January 2016, and December 2017, 368 were confirmed to have Zika virus infection. Cases of Zika virus infection were reported throughout the year, and from 29 of the 76 Thai provinces. Phylogenetic reconstructions suggest persistent circulation within Thailand since at least 2002. Evidence shows that Zika virus has circulated at a low but sustained level for at least 16 years, suggesting that Zika virus can adapt to persistent endemic transmission.

Julia A. Brown, Gursewwak Singh, Joshua A. Acklin, Silviana Lee, James E. Duehr, Anupa N. Chokola et al. Dengue Virus Immunity Increases Zika Virus-Induced Damage During Pregnancy.

Highlights
- Dengue-specific antibodies can enhance Zika virus pathogenesis during pregnancy
- Enhancement of Zika pathogenesis was observed in the placenta, not in the fetus
- Placental damage was associated with an increase in infected trophoblasts
- This process was found to be FcyR mediated

Zika virus (ZIKV) has recently been associated with birth defects and pregnancy loss after maternal infection. Because dengue virus (DENV) and ZIKV co-circulate, understanding the role of antibody-dependent enhancement in the context of pregnancy is critical. Here, we showed that the presence of DENV-specific antibodies in ZIKV-infected pregnant mice significantly increased placental damage, fetal growth restriction, and fetal resorption. This was associated with enhanced viral replication in the placenta that coincided with an increased frequency of infected trophoblasts. ZIKV-infected human placental tissues also showed increased replication in the presence of DENV antibodies, which was reversed by FcyR blocking antibodies. Furthermore, ZIKV-mediated fetal pathogenesis was enhanced in mice in the presence of a DENV-reactive monoclonal antibody, but not in the presence of the LALA variant, indicating a dependence on FcyR engagement. Our data suggest a possible mechanism for the recent increase in severe pregnancy outcomes after ZIKV infection in DENV-endemic areas.

[In a 27 Feb 2019 report published in Science Advances (Vol. 5, no. 2, eaav3208 DOI: 10.1126/sciadv.aav3208) the authors demonstrated maternal-to-fetal ZIKV transmission, fetal infection, and disproportionate microcephaly in immunocompetent mice. They showed that DENV-specific antibodies in ZIKV-infected pregnant mice enhance vertical ZIKV transmission and result in a severe microcephaly-like syndrome, which was dependent on the neonatal Fc receptor, FcRN. This novel immune-mediated mechanism of vertical transmission of viral infection is of special concern because ZIKV epidemic regions are also endemic to DENV. http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/2/eaav3208

It would be interesting to see whether the same relationship in Zika virus infection in pregnant dengue immune non-human primates occurs. - Mod.TY]

Christa Einspieler, PhD1; Fabiana Utsch, MD2; Patricia Brasil, MD3; et al. Association of Infants Exposed to Prenatal Zika Virus Infection With Their Clinical, Neurologic, and Developmental Status Evaluated via the General Movement Assessment Tool.

Key points
Question: Is there an association between general movement assessment results and neurodevelopment in infants with vertical Zika virus exposure?

Findings: In this cohort study of 444 children, including 111 prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash during the Zika epidemic, general movement assessment was associated with neurodevelopment at age 12 months (94% negative predictive value, 78% positive predictive value, 70% sensitivity, 96% specificity, and 91% accuracy). The Motor Optimality Score was 23 in children with normal development, 12 in children with adverse outcomes, and 5 in children with microcephaly, a significant difference.

Meaning: General movement assessment is a helpful tool in the evaluation of neurodevelopment in Zika virus-exposed children.

Abstract
Importance: There is an urgent need to assess neurodevelopment in Zika virus (ZIKV)-exposed infants.

Objectives: To perform general movement assessment (GMA) at 9 to 20 weeks' postterm ageand to evaluate whether the findings are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at age 12 months in infants prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash in Brazil during the ZIKV outbreak and in age-matched controls.

Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, infants prenatally exposed to acute maternal illness with rash were recruited at medical institutions in Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte, Brazil, from 1 Feb 2016, to 30 Apr 2017, while infants without any exposure to maternal illness originated from the Graz University Audiovisual Research Database for the Interdisciplinary Analysis of Neurodevelopment. Participants were 444 infants, including 76 infants without congenital microcephaly, 35 infants with microcephaly, and 333 neurotypical children matched for sex, gestational age at birth, and age at GMA.

Main Outcomes and Measures: General movement assessment performed at 9 to 20 weeks' post-term age, with negative predictive value, positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity generated, as well as clinical, neurologic, and developmental status (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition [Bayley-III] scores) at age 12 months. Motor Optimality Scores were generated based on the overall quality of the motor repertoire. Adverse outcomes were defined as a Bayley-III score less than 2 SD in at least 1 domain, a score less than 1 SD in at least 2 domains, and/or atypical neurologic findings.

Results: A total of 444 infants were enrolled, including 111 children prenatally exposed to a maternal illness with rash and 333 children without any prenatal exposure to maternal illness (57.7% male and mean [SD] age, 14 [2] weeks for both groups); 82.1% (46 of 56) of ZIKV-exposed infants without congenital microcephaly were healthy at age 12 months. 44 of 46 infants were correctly identified by GMA at 3 months, with a negative predictive value of 94% (95% CI, 85%-97%); 7 of 10 ZIKV-exposed children without microcephaly with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes were identified by GMA. The GMA positive predictive value was 78% (95% CI, 46%-94%), sensitivity was 70% (95% CI, 35%-93%), specificity was 96% (95% CI, 85%-99%), and accuracy was 91% (95% CI, 80%-97%). Children with microcephaly had bilateral spastic cerebral palsy; none had normal movements. The Motor Optimality Score differentiated outcomes: the median Motor Optimality Score was 23 (interquartile range [IQR], 21-26) in children with normal development, 12 (IQR, 8-19) in children with adverse outcomes, and 5 (IQR, 5-6) in children with microcephaly, a significant difference.

Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that although a large proportion of ZIKV-exposed infants without microcephaly develop normally, many do not. The GMA should be incorporated into routine infant assessments to enable early entry into targeted treatment programs.

Rita Carvalho-Sauera, Maria da Conceio Nascimento Costa, Florisneide R Barreto, Maria Gloria Teixeira. Congenital Zika Syndrome: Prevalence of low birth weight and associated factors. Bahia, 2015-2017.

Abstract
Objective
The clinical manifestations of congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) are not fully known, as example its effect on birth weight. This study estimated the prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) among children with CZS and identified associated factors.

Methods
Cross-sectional study involving 393 children with CZS living in Bahia, Brazil, in 2015-2017. Official Information Systems were the data sources. We calculated LBW prevalence and applied Logistic Regression to assess associated factors.

Results
Prevalence of LBW among children with CZS was 37.2%. Excluding pre-term births the proportion was 29.9%. This prevalence was 81.0% and 28.0%, among children born pre-term and term/post term, respectively. There was a higher proportion (53.2%) in female children, and ones delivered by cesarean section (51.4%). Most mothers were single/separated (62.1%) and had a low level of schooling (70.0%). In the model adjusted for type of delivery, preterm births presented a 10.8 times greater chance of presenting LBW than term/post-term ones. However, the Confidence Interval was very wide. Adjusting for gestation duration, children born by cesarean section had a 1.63 higher probability of presenting LBW than those born by vaginal delivery (OR = 1,63; CI95% 1.01, 2.63).

Conclusions
The prevalence of LBW among children with CZS was very elevated, both preterm and term/post-term live births. This can contribute to increasing their risk for morbimortality. The association of LBW with prematurity and cesarean deliveries is known, but in children with CZS, it has not been clarified whether or not this is related to pathological conditions caused by fetal infection by the Zika virus.

Oliver J. Brady, Aaron Osgood-Zimmerman, Nicholas J. Kassebaum, Sarah E. Ray, Valdelaine E. M. de Arajo, Aglar A. da Brega, et al. The association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly in Brazil 2015-2017: An observational analysis of over 4 million births.

Abstract

Background
In 2015, high rates of microcephaly were reported in Northeast Brazil following the 1st South American Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak. Reported microcephaly rates in other Zika-affected areas were significantly lower, suggesting alternate causes or the involvement of arboviral cofactors in exacerbating microcephaly rates.

Methods and findings
We merged data from multiple national reporting databases in Brazil to estimate exposure to 9 known or hypothesized causes of microcephaly for every pregnancy nationwide since the beginning of the ZIKV outbreak; this generated between 3.6 and 5.4 million cases (depending on analysis) over the time period 1 Jan 2015-23 May 2017. The association between ZIKV and microcephaly was statistically tested against models with alternative causes or with effect modifiers. We found no evidence for alternative non-ZIKV causes of the 2015-2017 microcephaly outbreak, nor that concurrent exposure to arbovirus infection or vaccination modified risk. We estimate an absolute risk of microcephaly of 40.8 (95% CI 34.2-49.3) per 10,000 births and a relative risk of 16.8 (95% CI 3.2-369.1) given ZIKV infection in the 1st or 2nd trimester of pregnancy; however, because ZIKV infection rates were highly variable, most pregnant women in Brazil during the ZIKV outbreak will have been subject to lower risk levels. Statistically significant associations of ZIKV with other birth defects were also detected, but at lower relative risks than that of microcephaly (relative risk under 1.5). Our analysis was limited by missing data prior to the establishment of nationwide ZIKV surveillance, and its findings may be affected by unmeasured confounding causes of microcephaly not available in routinely collected surveillance data.

Conclusions
This study strengthens the evidence that congenital ZIKV infection, particularly in the 1st 2 trimesters of pregnancy, is associated with microcephaly and less frequently with other birth defects. The finding of no alternative causes for geographic differences in microcephaly rate leads us to hypothesize that the Northeast region was disproportionately affected by this Zika outbreak, with 94% of an estimated 8.5 million total cases occurring in this region, suggesting a need for seroprevalence surveys to determine the underlying reason.

Author summary
Why was this study done?
- In late 2015 above average rates of the congenital malformation microcephaly were reported in Northeast Brazil.
- This coincided with the 1st introduction of Zika in the Americas, and evidence of the association between Zika virus infection in pregnancy and microcephaly shortly followed.
- However, considerably lower rates of microcephaly were later observed elsewhere in Brazil and in other areas to which Zika subsequently spread.
- This led to suggestions of alternative causes or cofactors present in Northeast Brazil and uncertainty over the magnitude of risk that women infected with Zika in pregnancy faced.

What did the researchers do and find?
- In this study we attempted to assemble information on 9 known or hypothesized causes of microcephaly for every birth in Brazil since the beginning of the Zika outbreak. We then statistically tested different hypotheses about the cause of the 2015-2017 microcephaly outbreak nationwide.
- We found no evidence for alternative non-Zika causes of the microcephaly outbreak nor did we find evidence that microcephaly risk was modified by concurrent dengue infection or previous yellow fever vaccination.
- Women infected with Zika virus early in pregnancy were 17 times (95% confidence interval 3-369) more likely to have a child with microcephaly.
- We found that microcephaly risk was highest in women with Zika infection in the 1st 2 trimesters, and that these women may also be at higher risk of developing other non-microcephaly birth defects, but that this is a rarer outcome of congenital Zika infection.

What do these findings mean?
- These findings add to the growing evidence that Zika infection early in pregnancy has a generalisable association with microcephaly and, to a lesser extent, a range of other birth defects.
- What this study adds is the ability to map the impact of Zika across broad areas, and it leads us to hypothesize that Northeast Brazil experienced a significantly more substantial Zika outbreak than the rest of the country, with 92% of an estimated 8.5 million Zika cases.
- Community-representative seroprevalence surveys across Brazil are needed to test this hypothesis and give insights into the risk of further Zika outbreaks in Brazil.

Griffin I, Martin SW, Fischer M, Chambers TV, Kosoy O, Falise A, et al. Zika Virus IgM Detection and Neutralizing Antibody Profiles 12-19 Months after Illness Onset.

Data on the duration of detectable Zika virus-specific IgM in infected persons are limited. Neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity occurs between Zika virus and related flaviviruses, but the degree to which this confounds diagnosis is uncertain. We tested serum specimens collected 12-19 months after illness onset from patients with confirmed Zika virus disease for Zika virus IgM and Zika virus and dengue virus neutralizing antibodies. Among 62 participants, 45 (73%) had detectable Zika virus IgM and 12 (19%) had an equivocal result. Although all patients tested had Zika virus neutralizing antibodies, 39 (63%) also had neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus; of those, 12 (19%) had a less than 4-fold difference between Zika virus and dengue virus titers, and 5 (8%) had dengue virus titer over 4-fold higher than Zika virus titer. Prolonged detection of IgM and neutralizing antibody cross-reactivity make it difficult to determine the timing of Zika virus infection and differentiate between related flaviviruses.

Isabel Rodriguez-Barraquer, Federico Costa, Eduardo J. M. Nascimento, Nivison Nery Janior, Priscila M. S. Castanha, Gielson Almeida Sacramento, et al. Impact of preexisting dengue immunity on Zika virus emergence in a dengue endemic region.

Zika dynamics in South America
The infection dynamics of Zika virus (ZIKV) are difficult to characterize. Many ZIKV infections are asymptomatic, and the clinical presentation of ZIKV is nonspecific. Rodriguez-Barraquer et al. took advantage of a long-term health study under way in Salvador, Brazil, the epicenter of the recent outbreak in the Americas. They used multiple serological assays, from before and after the emergence of ZIKV in October 2015, to distinguish ZIKV immune responses from those against Dengue virus (DENV). About 73% of the population was attacked by ZIKV. The presence of preexisting antibodies to DENV was associated with less risk of ZIKV infection and fewer symptoms.

Abstract
The clinical outcomes associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas have been well documented, but other aspects of the pandemic, such as attack rates and risk factors, are poorly understood. We prospectively followed a cohort of 1453 urban residents in Salvador, Brazil, and, using an assay that measured immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) responses against ZIKV NS1 antigen, we estimated that 73% of individuals were infected during the 2015 outbreak. Attack rates were spatially heterogeneous, varying by a factor of 3 within a community spanning 0.17 square km. Preexisting high antibody titers to dengue virus were associated with reduced risk of ZIKV infection and symptoms. The landscape of ZIKV immunity that now exists may affect the risk for future transmission.

[These results in Salvador, Brazil, support similar findings of a study done in Nicaragua that also show that preexisting dengue antibodies in a pediatric cohort protect against Zika virus disease (see Zika virus (01): Americas, Asia research, observations 20190204.6293304). Because of the antigenic cross-reactivity between dengue and Zika viruses, it seems reasonable to assume that Zika virus infection with viremia is suppressed, but with enough antigenic stimulation by Zika virus to elicit an antibody response and clear the virus. The cross-reactive dengue antibodies may buy enough time for the Zika virus antibodies to clear the virus with little or no disease. Although earlier in vitro studies raised concern about the possibility of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Zika virus infections by preexisting dengue virus antibody in an ADE assay (see Zika virus (39): Americas, Europe 20160729.4378060), an in vivo rhesus monkey model did not confirm ADE (see Zika virus (15): Americas, research, observations 20170701.5144254). One hopes that ADE will not be of concern when Zika virus vaccines are applied in the field in the future. - Mod.TY]

Krista M. Milich, Benjamin J. Koestler, Joe H. Simmons, Pramod N. Nehete, Anthony Di Fiore, Lawrence E. Williams, et al. Methods for detecting Zika virus in feces: A case study in captive squirrel monkeys (_Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis_).

Abstract
A strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) of Asian origin associated with birth defects and neurological disorders has emerged and spread through the Americas. ZIKV was 1st isolated in the blood of nonhuman primates in Africa and has been detected in the blood, saliva, and urine of a few catarrhine species in both Africa and Asia, suggesting that nonhuman primates may serve as both a source and a reservoir of the virus. The recent introduction of ZIKV to human populations in the Americas presents the potential for the virus to spread into nonhuman primate reservoirs. Thus, it is critical to develop efficient and noninvasive detection methods to monitor the spread of the virus in wild nonhuman primate populations. Here, we describe a method for ZIKV detection in noninvasively collected fecal samples of a Neotropical primate. Fecal samples were collected from two captive squirrel monkeys (_Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis_) that were experimentally infected with ZIKV (Strain Mexico_1_44) and an additional 2 uninfected squirrel monkeys. Nucleic acids were extracted from these samples, and RT-qPCR was used to assay for the presence of ZIKV using primers flanking a 101 bp region of the NS5 gene. In both ZIKV-inoculated animals, ZIKV was detected 5-11 days post-infection, but was not detected in the uninfected animals. We compare the fecal results to ZIKV detection in serum, saliva, and urine samples from the same individuals. Our results indicate that fecal detection is a cost-effective, noninvasive method for monitoring wild populations of Neotropical primates as possible ZIKV reservoirs.

[This report raises the question of whether Zika virus can be maintained in wild non-human primate populations. If Zika virus has become established in wild primates, circulating in a sylvan (forest) cycle similar to that of yellow fever virus, that would make eradication of the virus impossible and assure that it would be, or has become, established in tropical countries in the Americas. There is some evidence that Zika virus infects wild non-human primates in Brazil. A 30 Oct 2018 published report indicates that Zika virus has been detected in 33 of 82 dead monkeys (free-living common marmosets, _Callithrix jacchus_, and black-striped capuchin, _Sapajus libidinosus_) found in Brazil near Sao Jose do Rio Preto, Sao Paulo State, and Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Whole genome sequencing showed the virus to be very similar to the type that was infecting humans. Experimentally infected squirrel monkeys (_Saimiri_ spp.) and owl monkeys (_Aotus_ spp.) had viremia in the absence of detectible disease, and seroconversion occurred by day 28 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-34423-6). Detection of Zika virus infection by testing feces would provide a useful tool for surveillance of wild non-human primates in localities where Zika virus outbreaks in humans have occurred. - Mod.TY]
