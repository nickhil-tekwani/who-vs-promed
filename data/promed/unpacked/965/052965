_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd EPPO A2 List) is widespread in
Russia and still poses problems for seed potato production. Symptoms
resembling those of PSTVd were 1st reported in European Russia in the
early 1930s, but at that time with a limited distribution and low
economic importance.

In the 1980s and 1990s, a reduction of yield and quality of seed
potatoes started to be observed. The initial suspicions that seed
potatoes and in vitro plants could be infected by PSTVd were
confirmed by studies carried out in the 1990s. During these studies,
the viroid was detected in 50 to 70 percent of in vitro plants and
tuber samples collected from different regions of Russia. A research
project on the diversity of PSTVd isolates in Russia was initiated in
2006.

39 PSTVd isolates were collected over a 15-year period from distant
areas of Russia (Central Russia, Southern Russia, Far East) and were
characterized [see also ProMED-mail post 20070423.1323]. Sequence
analysis revealed a rather low sequence diversity, although 16 new
PSTVd sequence variants were recovered from Russian seed potatoes.

[_Potato spindle tuber viroid_ (PSTVd; type member of genus
_Pospiviroid_) is an important pathogen of solanaceous plants
including crops like potato, tomato and capsicum, as well as
ornamental species. It causes spindle tuber (or "gothic") disease in
potato and bunchy top in tomato. Yield losses can be up to 65 percent
in potato and up to 50 percent in tomato.

In potato, shoots are spindly and may show distortions and
proliferations; plants are stunted, and tubers are small, elongated,
cylindrical, spindle or dumb-bell-shaped, with prominent eyes evenly
distributed over the tuber. Sprouting is slower than in healthy
tubers. All potato (and tomato) varieties appear to be susceptible
with no natural resistance to PSTVd available. However, mild strains
causing latent infections in some host cultivars exist.

PSTVd is seed transmitted in potato at a rate of up to 100 percent,
depending on the cultivar. Spread occurs also via infected plants or
plant parts (including seed tubers), pollen, mechanical means and
plant-to-plant contact. Only in the presence of _Potato leafroll
virus_ PSTVd can also be transmitted by an aphid vector (_Myzus
persicae_). PSTVd (like viroids in general) is exceptionally stable
due to its molecular structure and can survive in sap or leaf litter
for considerable times. PSTVd-free planting material can be obtained
by tissue culture techniques, but only a certain percentage of
resulting lines can be expected to be clean of the pathogen.
Therefore, a reliable certification scheme for PSTVd-free seed tubers
is essential in disease management.

The low sequence diversity reported in Russian PSTVd isolates would
support the hypothesis that infected tissue cultures distributed
originally from a central multiplication facility were the sources of
most PSTVd records in the country. However, even single nucleotide
changes may lead to major changes in pathogenicity of viroids, and
sequence changes may have occurred before or after dissemination of
seed tubers. Furthermore, a small number of strains were also
detected which are sufficiently different to make an independent
introduction from other sources likely (see also ProMED-mail post
20070423.1323).

The national assessment of PSTVd strains undertaken in Russia is
considered an important prerequisite to providing reliable sources of
clean planting material to farmers. The results also show the
importance of monitoring and quarantine measures even for pathogens
that are already present in an area.
