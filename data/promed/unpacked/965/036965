[1] Kenya (Rift Valley): stem rust, severe strains

Disease hits Kenyan crops
-------------------------
Kenya, with nearly a quarter of its 38 million people facing severe
hunger, is now reporting a rapid spread of diseases affecting the
country's vital wheat and banana [see ProMED-mail post no.
20090311.1006] crops.

Recent reports from Kenya's breadbasket region of the Rift Valley
have confirmed what the country can ill-afford -- the spread of a
deadly strain of a parasitic fungus called stem rust that is
threatening to wipe out the country's wheat fields.

Kenyan Agriculture Permanent Secretary Romano Kiome said, "It is a
serious concern. Stem rust, of course, is controllable with
chemicals, but it is damn expensive. The only solution is to bring in
new varieties that are resistant to stem rust."

In Kenya, most of the fields affected by the stem rust strain belong
to small-scale farmers, who grow 20 percent of the wheat consumed
annually. Although maize is the staple among most Kenyans, wheat
flour has grown crucial to the country's overall food supply,
especially in the past year.

[2] India (Punjab): stripe rust

Rising temps halt spread of yellow rust on wheat in Punjab
----------------------------------------------------------
As the wheat crop is at late dough stage and the climatic conditions,
particularly increasing temperatures, are not favourable for the
yellow rust development, the farmers need not spray any fungicide for
the management of the disease at this stage.

Yellow rust of wheat had appeared in certain pockets of the state,
particularly on wheat cultivar PBW-343. The disease started appearing
in the 1st week of February [2009] in the district of Ropar,
Fatehgarh Sahib, and Hoshiarpur. Subsequently, it started spreading
to others area due to favourable conditions but the rising
temperatures halted the further development and spread of the disease

[3] Australia: stem and stripe rusts

Worries that winds could bring grain diseases to SA
---------------------------------------------------
A plant pathologist says South Australian broadacre crops are at risk
of both stem and stripe rust migrating from interstate.

Hugh Wallwork, from South Australia's Research and Development
Institute [SARDI], says stem rust has been found in flood-affected
northern New South Wales and in Esperance in Western Australia. He
says bi-monthly winds from the east, as well as prevailing westerly
winds, could carry the disease into South Australia.

"Although we have really no volunteer [wheat plants] probably
harbouring stripe rust in South Australia, there is a particularly
high risk of stripe rust surviving in northern New South Wales and
that could form a threat to us in the coming season."

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp.
_tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 70 percent are reported, but
some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the
most dangerous at present is strain Ug99, which has overcome the
major resistance gene used in our current wheat varieties. Ug99 is
spreading eastwards from its origin in Uganda and is now considered
present in much of East Africa, Yemen, and Iran, and also suspected
in some additional countries in the region. An even more virulent
variant able to overcome additional resistance genes has recently
emerged in Kenya. The stem rust reported in item [1] from Kenya is
likely to be either Ug99 or the even more severe newer strain, but
these strains are at this time not present in Australia (item [3]).

Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereal crops is caused by
the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes
yellow leaf stripes, stunting of plants, and reduces grain production
with yield losses of 40 to 100 percent. It affects wheat, some barley
varieties, triticale, and a number of grass species. New pathogen
strains with increased virulence have been reported in recent years
from wheat growing areas in Europe, North America, and Australia. In
India, an outbreak of stripe rust has also recently been reported
from Jammu and Kashmir (ProMED-mail post no. 20090305.0897)

For both fungi, spores are spread by wind and with infected straw,
and some grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge"
providing inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management
includes the use of resistant varieties (if available), fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer wheat. For more information on
stripe rust, stem rust, and Ug99 please see previous ProMED-mail
