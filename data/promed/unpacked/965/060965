Contaminated pickles have been linked by the Cook County Department
of Public Health to an outbreak of salmonellosis.

According to public health officials, 6 confirmed cases of
salmonellosis have been linked to pickles purchased from the Assi
Market in the Chicago suburb of Niles. Five people have been hospitalized.

Manager Skip Yoo said it is possible the pickles were "cross
contaminated," adding store executives are cooperating with health officials.

Health department officials say all confirmed victims of
salmonellosis reported eating pickles made at the market and sold in
plastic bags between 25-27 Jul 2010, with a 24 Aug 2010 sell-by date.

[Although a small, localized outbreak, this cluster is unusual for
the vehicle implicated. The process of pickling kills most pathogenic
bacteria; however, the kill rates can be variable based, in part, on
temperature and pathogen. This can be seen in the following
publication with its abstract included:

Breidt F Jr, Hayes J, McFeeters RF: Determination of 5-log reduction
times for food pathogens in acidified cucumbers during storage at 10
and 25 degrees C. J Food Prot. 2007;70: 2638-41.

Abstract
---------
Outbreaks of acid-resistant foodborne pathogens in acid foods with pH
values below 4.0, including apple cider and orange juice, have raised
concerns about the safety of acidified vegetable products. For
acidified vegetable products with pH values between 3.3 and 4.6,
previous research has demonstrated that thermal treatments are needed
to achieve a 5-log reduction in the numbers of _E. coli_ O157:H7,
_Listeria monocytogenes_, or _Salmonella enterica_. For some
acidified vegetable products with a pH of 3.3 or below, heat
processing can result in unacceptable product quality. The purpose of
this study was to determine the holding times needed to achieve a
5-log reduction in _E. coli_ O157:H7, _L. monocytogenes_, and _S.
enterica_ strains in acidified vegetable products with acetic acid as
the primary acidulant, a pH of 3.3 or below, and a minimum
equilibrated temperature of 10 C. We found _E. coli_ O157:H7 to be
the most acid-resistant microorganism for the conditions tested, wi!
th a predicted time to achieve a 5-log reduction in cell numbers at
10 C of 5.7 days, compared with 2.1 days (51 h) for _Salmonella_ or
0.5 days (11.2 h) for _Listeria_. At 25 C, the _E. coli_ O157:H7
population achieved a 5-log reduction in 1.4 days (34.3 h).

Pickling, (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickling>) also known as
brining or corning, is the process of preserving food by anaerobic
fermentation in brine (a solution of salt in water) to produce lactic
acid, or marinating and storing it in an acid solution, usually
vinegar (acetic acid). The resulting food is called a pickle. This
procedure gives the food a salty or sour taste.

Another distinguishing characteristic is a pH less than 4.6, which is
sufficient to kill most bacteria. Pickling can preserve perishable
foods for months. Antimicrobial herbs and spices, such as mustard
seed, garlic, cinnamon or cloves, are often added.

The term pickle is derived from the Dutch word pekel, meaning brine.
In the USA and Canada, the word pickle alone almost always refers to
a pickled cucumber (other types of pickles will be described as
"pickled onion," "pickled cauliflower," etc.). - Mod.LL]
