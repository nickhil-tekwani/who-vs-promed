The 5 Kentucky children hospitalized in an _E. coli_ outbreak earlier in September 2014 all consumed milk from the same raw milk dairy, according to multiple reports and the mother of one of the sickened children. The Kentucky Department for Public Health has not announced the source of the outbreak. Microbial testing of animals, milk samples, and environmental samples from the dairy in question came back negative for _E. coli_. Since tests at the dairy did not reveal any contamination, the state health department did not order the dairy to suspend sales.

The state health department has not returned calls from Food Safety News looking for updates on the outbreak investigation. On [Thu 25 Sep 2014], a spokesman for the Lincoln Trail District Health Department in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, said that the state health department would be publishing an update by [Fri 26 Sep 2014], but it had not yet surfaced as of [Mon 29 Sep 2014]. Because no additional illnesses have been reported since the outbreak announcement, the source of contamination is not believed to pose a continuing public health threat, the spokesman said.

The mother of an 18-month-old boy hospitalized in the outbreak, told Food Safety News that each of the children sickened in the outbreak belong to families in the same food club that allows legal access to raw milk from one dairy. Raw milk is not legal to sell at retail in Kentucky, but residents can buy into food clubs, or herd shares, through which raw milk can be legally purchased.

The mother's son fell ill with hemolytic uremic syndrome, a kidney disease associated with severe _E. coli_ infections. He spent most of September 2014 in the hospital, but was discharged last week [week of week of 20 Oct 2014] and is recovering. She said 3 other children from her family's food club were checked into the same children's hospital at the same time as her son. Each of those children was also given raw milk by their parents, she said.

After the 5 children fell ill in early September 2014, the food club advised its members to dispose of any remaining raw milk as a precaution, according to well-respected raw milk journalist David Gumpert. The club did not order any more milk for 2 weeks, but recently began ordering it again, Gumpert said.

Food Safety News will continue to watch for an update from the Kentucky Department for Public Health. As with many foodborne illness outbreaks, the investigation may not uncover enough evidence to conclusively pinpoint a source.

According to the CDC, raw milk is 150 times more likely to cause foodborne illness compared to pasteurized milk, and it hospitalizes 13 times more individuals than pasteurized dairy products.

[If the information from this non-traditional news source is correct, the epidemiological link between the cases of EHEC-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome and the unpasteurized milk seems strong whether the pathogen was isolated from the milk or not. Inadequate refrigeration of the tainted vehicle of transmission may have played a role in the cases.

Although campylobacteriosis is the most common bacterial pathogen transmitted by the "Russian roulette" use of unpasteurized milk in the USA, certainly enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ is a player in this scenario as well. - Mod.LL
