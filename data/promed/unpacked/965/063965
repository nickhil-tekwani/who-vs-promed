The poultry industry in Cyprus has been devastated by an outbreak of Newcastle disease [NCD], which has resulted in the loss of more than 250 000 birds so far. The outbreak began in a broiler unit on 11 Jun 2013, according to a report issued by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Updates issued since that initial report show that another 3 units on the island have now been hit by the disease [according to updated information as of 9 Jul 2013, 13 outbreaks have been reported]. A total of 251 000 birds have either died from the disease or been destroyed by the authorities in their response to the outbreak. All of the affected farms are in the Lefkosia district of Cyprus [but see commentary below].

The 1st farm affected was at Kokkinotrimithia, where 115 500 birds were kept in 5 houses on a broiler unit. The OIE says that the signs that something was wrong included an increased mortality rate and respiratory and neurological problems amongst the birds. A total of 44 241 birds died as a result of the disease. The rest of the flock was destroyed.

The 2nd unit affected was just 100 metres [328 feet] away from the 1st one. The
43 500-bird broiler unit reported increased mortality, with 10 164 birds falling victim to the outbreak. Post mortem examinations [reports] said that lesions consistent with Newcastle disease were discovered on the birds. Again, the rest of the flock was slaughtered by the authorities. On the 3rd farm affected, 5742 birds out of a flock of 24 000 died as a result of the disease. The rest were destroyed. The 4th outbreak was in a 68 000-bird flock owned by the farm involved in the original outbreak. A total of 1462 birds died from the disease. The others were slaughtered in response to the outbreak.

Giorgos Kyriakides, director of the veterinary services in Cyprus, described the situation as "very difficult" and said that the authorities were taking a series of precautionary measures to limit the spread of the virus. He said it was the 1st time that such an outbreak had been recorded on the island for [a?] decade. He also suggested that the infection could have been transmitted from farms in the Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus. The island has been divided between Turkish and Greek zones since the war of 1974.

NCD is a highly contagious disease affecting both wild and domestic birds and caused by a paramyxovirus. The disease is a worldwide problem. The outbreak in Cyprus, showing as increased mortality, respiratory and nervous signs, is a timely reminder of this potentially devastating disease [for the European poultry industry].

The last outbreak in chickens and turkeys in the UK was in 1997, and was linked to migration of wild birds driven to the UK following an exceptionally hard and cold winter in other parts of Northern Europe.

NCD can occur in a variety of forms, depending on the strain of virus involved. The clinical signs can be equally variable, ranging from very mild through to highly virulent causing 100 percent mortality. Clinical signs also depend on the strain involved and which organ is most severely affected, with a combination of respiratory, nervous and diarrhoea manifestations. In its most severe form it is only likely to be confused with avian influenza, or some catastrophic equipment failure in controlled environment accommodation, or some major toxic incident.

[The 7 new outbreaks covered above in OIE follow-up report no 3 are backyard holdings, detected due to the surveillance undertaken by Cyprus veterinary services in response to the virulent outbreak; 5 of them, like the previous 7, are located in Lefkosia; 2 infected backyard holdings (outbreaks 1 & 12) are located in Paphos.
