Concerning Mod.MHJ's question about the anthrax outbreak in Finland and the
"contaminated" feed, I can explain what we mean.
The summer was very rainy in Finland. The farm has made silage recently and
it was contaminated with soil. The situation in 1988 was exactly the same.
On that farm there was a case about 30 years ago, so we think the feed was
contaminated with soil (and spores). We are trying to find determine
whether there had also been earlier anthrax cases on the farm where the
case has been confirmed.

[Our thanks to Dr. Heinonen for this update. As many farms have had anthrax
cases in their past, one should not rest on this speculative 'cause', but
attempt to confirm it through demonstrating spores in the surface soil at
any graves that can be identified. It is not impossible that a fresh silage
pit might have been constructed through an old cattle grave. We should also
continue to rule out any and all alternative explanations. - Mod.MHJ]
