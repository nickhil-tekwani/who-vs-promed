At least 20 children have died in the past 10 days following the
outbreak of various unknown viral and tropical diseases in a remote
tribal-dominated village in Tripura, officials in Agartala said on
Friday [25 Jun 2010].

"The children mostly died at their homes in remote Kangrai tribal
village along the Tripura-Mizoram border in northern Tripura,"
doctors and officials who visited the affected areas told reporters
at divisional headquarters, Kanchanpur. Many other children and
elders also fell ill. Some were admitted to the sub-divisional hospital.

Family welfare and preventive medicine director R.K. Dhar said:
"Several medical teams with specialist physicians from state,
district and divisional headquarters have rushed to the affected
village, 215 km from here." Doctors and officials have to trek at
least 20 km of hilly terrain to reach the remote village. Dhar said:
"The children might have died due to various viral, seasonal and
respiratory infections. The medical teams sent to the village will
collect blood and other samples to confirm the disease."

A team of Congress leaders led by legislator Subal Bhowmik on
Thursday [24 Jun 2010] visited the affected village and demanded
immediate control of the disease. "Neither the health minister nor
his officials and directors have visited the remote areas. There is
no seriousness on the government's part to deal with the outbreak of
the unknown diseases," Bhowmik told reporters. The health
infrastructure in the rural areas of Tripura is very poor, he added.

The deaths of more than 28 people belonging to the Reang community,
including 14 children, in remote Kangrai village of North Tripura
district following an outbreak of fever accompanied by respiratory
problems have shaken the state government.

[The Reangs constitute the 2nd largest group among the tribal
population of Tripura. It is generally believed that this particular
community migrated to Tripura from somewhere in the Chittagong hill
Tracts in the middle part of the 15th century. The Reangs are a
disciplined community but backward both educationally and
economically, and, therefore, they are still considered to be a
primitive group. - Mod.CP]

Fearing more casualties, health minister Tapan Chakraborty today [26
Jun 2010] rushed to Kanchanpur subdivisional town, 12 km from the
village, with the director of health services, Satya Debbarma, and a
team of specialist doctors. Congress MLA Subal Bhowmik, who had
visited Kangrai with a group of party workers on Thursday [24 Jun
2010], has demanded Chakraborty's resignation. "I had to visit the
village enveloped by a funerary silence after trekking 12 km across
the hills, but what I saw was beyond belief. After having reached the
[isolated] village around 11 am, I found silent preparations being
made by the parents for the burial of their children," Bhowmik said
on his return to Agartala this morning. He noted down the names of
the 28 people who had died. The list has names included 14 children.

On returning to the subdivisional town of Kanchanpur, Bhowmik
yesterday [25 Jun 2010] spoke to SDO Dilip Kumar Chakma and
subdivisional medical officer Subrata Roy, but they allegedly feigned
ignorance. When confronted with the figures, the names and other
details, Roy said he had informed the health directorate in Agartala
about the spread of the disease and the need for emergency supply of
medicine. Chakraborty rushed to Kanchanpur with a team of 5 senior
doctors and emergency medicine supplies.

"According to our records, 14 people had died, but we are going to
organise special health camps in the Kangrai area. The place is
remote," Chakraborty said, adding that he would visit Kangrai village
tomorrow [27 Jun 2010] with doctors and nurses.

The description of the symptoms of the illness is not sufficiently
precise to indicate whether this outbreak has been caused by a novel
pathogen such as Nipah virus or a more familiar agent such as avian
(H5N1) or pandemic (H1N1) influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis
virus, or malaria which may be prevalent in the area, or a
combination of agents. ProMED-mail would welcome any additional
information from the region.
