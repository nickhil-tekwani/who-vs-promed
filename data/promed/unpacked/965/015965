[The ongoing Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza
(HPAI) problems in West Africa, and especially in
Nigeria and now Ghana, can present risks to the
rest of the world through the smuggling of
parrots and especially African Greys to the
richer markets outside of Africa. Latterly it was
Asian hawks and falcons to Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait. It would not be surprising if there were
an equal but out of sight risk from parrots,
legal and otherwise. The next Hadj is some months
away, scheduled for 16-20 Dec 2007, but there is
always western Europe. Read on: - Mod MHJ]

countries: Investigate reputed illegal trade in
all range states, but specifically in Cameroon,
Cote d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo,
Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Togo,
and notably in Nigeria where illegal exports, and
possibly imports, are believed to be substantial and requiring attention.

Any parrots to declare?
------------------------
Border guards at Ghana's frontier have seized 50
parrots from traders smuggling them into Togo.
The parrot smugglers were arrested on unapproved
bush paths to Lomï¿½the Togolese capital.
Exporting parrots was banned in 1979 after it was
discovered that Muslim pilgrims often buy them
for sale in Saudi Arabia during their Hadj
pilgrimages. The high demand for birds has raised
their prices to rival those of gold, diamonds and
marijuana, the items most sought by smugglers.
The birds are bought from local trappers for
between 2000 cedis (US $727) and double that price.
Last August [1983], it was reported that two
consignments of parrots totalling 1,140 were
seized at Accra airport and sold for a total of Ce, 570 000 (US $20 700).
