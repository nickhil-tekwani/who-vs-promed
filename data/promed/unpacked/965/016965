A total of 13 people have been reported dead in Abim and Agago
districts, following an outbreak of a strange disease in Abim. 20
cases have been reported in Abim district, out of whom 8 have already
died. In neighbouring Agago district, 5 cases have been reported in
the sub counties of Omiya P'Chua and Paimol, which border Abim
district. Emmanuel Okech, an official from the Abim district health
office, said out of the 20 cases, 8 have died, 2 have been
quarantined, and another 10 have been discharged after their
conditions improved.

According to Okech, the affected persons have high fever, vomit blood,
pass bloody stools, and also bleed from other openings like the nose
and ears. "The victims usually die between 3 and 5 days and are
suspected to be highly contagious," Okech said.

Last week [week ending 14 Nov 2010], a team from the World Health
Organization and the Ministry of Health went to Abim and are
investigating the disease. According to Okech, samples were taken to
the Uganda Virus Research Institute, but there is still no clue as to
what disease is affecting the people there.

"We were suspecting viral hemorrhagic infection, but results from the
Uganda Virus Research Institute have ruled out Ebola, Marburg, and
Lassa," Okech said. He said samples from the affected persons have now
been flown to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta.

On [Tue 16 Nov 2010], the district health officer of Agago district,
Dr Emmanuel Otto, announced that 5 people had died in Paimol and Omiya
P'Chua from infections similar to those reported in Abim. Dr. Otto
said he was also expecting a team of doctors from the World Health
Organization and the Health Ministry in Agago to go to the affected
sub-counties and conduct tests to ascertain the nature of the disease.

According to Emmanuel Okech, more than 10 percent of patients treated
in Abim Hospital are from neighboring Agago district, raising
suspicions that the 5 who died in Agago could have contracted the
disease while they went for treatment in Abim Hospital. Meanwhile,
authorities in Abim district have put up an isolation center for those
suspected to have contracted the disease.

According to Abim district chairman Norman Ochero, the district health
sector and its partners have pooled resources to set up an isolation
center in Abim Hospital and Morulem Health Centre. "We have also
advised people to maintain personal hygiene and to desist from
handshakes," said Ochero [but see last comment below].

[This undiagnosed illness in northeastern Uganda has a clinical
presentation that suggests viral hemorrhagic fever. However, tests
done at the Uganda Virus Research Institute have ruled out Ebola,
Marburg and Lassa fevers. The differential diagnosis is wide and
includes other viral infections, particularly arbovirus infections;
bacterial infections such as typhoid fever and shigellosis;
rickettsial diseases; and parasitic infections such as malaria. This
cluster definitely warrants a comprehensive epidemiological
investigation, and further information on the cause of this evolving
outbreak will be appreciated.

[In 2008, Lujo virus (LUJV), a new member of the family _Arenaviridae_
responsible for a severe haemorrhagic fever, was isolated in South
Africa during an outbreak of human disease characterized by nosocomial
transmission and an unprecedented high case fatality rate of 80
percent (4/5 cases). This virus was characterised molecularly and
found to be an arenavirus distinct from previously known Old World
arenaviruses (such as Lassa fever virus).

In September and October 2008, 5 cases of this previously undiagnosed
haemorrhagic fever, 4 of them fatal, were treated in South Africa
after transfer of a critically ill index case from Zambia. This highly
lethal virus has not been recorded subsequently elsewhere in Africa,
but Lujo virus should be considered as a possible etiologic agent in
the current outbreak of undiagnosed haemorrhagic fever in Uganda. That
apart, the methodology of unbiased high throughput pyrosequencing
(see:
<http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1000455>) developed by Ian Likkin and colleagues for the initial characterisation of the highly lethal Lujo virus could be applied with profit in the current disease situation in Uganda. -

[Hemorrhagic fevers are spread by arthropods or contact with body
fluids or excreta of infected humans and animals, not by handshake. -
