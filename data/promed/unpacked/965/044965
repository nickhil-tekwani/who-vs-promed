This year [2009] Uberaba registered 397 dengue reports, of which 167
cases were confirmed, compared to 74 last year [2008]. One of these
cases was dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), but the person recovered.

The Prefect of Aberaba, Anderson Adauto, and the Secretary of Health,
Valdemar Hial, as a preventive measure, formed a working group
composed of the Secretary of Health, with Health Surveillance, Works,
Traffic and Transportation, Inspection and Education, coordinated by
the Government Secretariat. The group will work on prevention
measures and monitoring.

According to the data presented by Epidemiological Surveillance, up
to now there have been 400 000 visitors; 2199 in strategic sites, 10
469 visits in houses of suspected dengue [cases], 500 kg of tires
collected, 587 covers fabricated and 5589 covers placed. Yet there
are those districts that had a higher mosquito infestation in the
month of May, which are: Leblon, Abbey, Garden City Park and St. Gerard.

Totals reported by the state Secretariat of Health showed that the
cities with the most reported [dengue] cases are Belo Horizonte, in
1st place on the list with 15 019 reported cases, followed by Coronel
Fabriciano, in Vale do Aco, with 2819 [cases], and in 3rd place is
Curvelo, in the Central Region, with 1841 casos. Governador
Valadares, in Vale do Rio Doce, is in 4th (1818), followed by

The National Center for Epidemiological Surveillance and Disease
Control (CENAVECE), of the federal Secretariat of Health, reported
last night [12 Oct 2009] that there were 373 new dengue cases in
Jalisco confirmed dring epidemiological week 39, which is 27 Sep - 3

A dengue outbreak occurred in Mecatlan, a municipality located in the
high areas of the Totonacapan mountains, which alarmed the health
authorities with 35 people who presented with DHF symptoms.

The prevailing situation was known since Thursday [8 Oct 2009] in an
area in this municipality, even including a death, and this Sunday
[11 Oct 2009] the health sector and its head, Manuel Lila de Arce,
arrived at the site to attend to ill people and apply sanitary
measures in the community. The authorities have not confirmed the
reported death. This would be the 1st case of concern due to the
concentration in one locality in the north of the area, as the
highest number of of dengue cases (more than 2000) are concentrated
in Coatzacoalcos .

Guatemala has recorded a number of dengue deaths. This Central
American nation registered 16 deaths this year [2009], the highest
number in the region, announced the Pan American Health Organization
(PAHO) representative in Nicaragua, Jorge Luis Prosperis.

In statements on local television channel 12, the PAHO official said
this Thursday [8 Oct 2009] that during the same period 8 people have
died [of dengue] in Nicaragua, 4 in Panama, 3 in Honduras and 2 in El
Salvador, while Costa Rica and Belize have not reported any deaths
from the disease.

Prosperis indicated that up to epidemiological week 38, that is to
say since a week ago, El Salvador has recorded 7206 dengue cases,
Honduras 6000, Guatemala 4000, Costa Rica 3300, Panama 2000 and Belize 400.

"When we speak of cases, we refer to people with dengue signs for
rendering treatment," the official emphasized, and attributed these
dengue cases in Central America in which this year [2009] the rains
in the region have been scarce and temperatures high, climatic
conditions which favor breeding of the vector mosquito that transmits
the disease [virus]. He also indicated that carelessness of the
population in the region for elimination of the breeding sites of the
mosquito, which breed in stagnant, uncovered clean water.

Regarding Nicaragua, he noted that the dengue virus that is
circulating this year has not circulated for 10 years in this
country, and is more aggressive [virulent] than other varieties
[dengue virus strains or serotypes], which makes the population of
children more vulnerable. "During these [past] 10 years, the children
have not developed antibodies against this type of dengue [virus],"
said the PAHO representative, and reported that as a result of the
efforts that have been made to channel international aid to combat
the dengue outbreak, the Spanish International Cooperation Agency for
Development recently donated USD 100 000 to Nicaragua. "PAHO has
donated its own funds of 500 000 cordobas (USD 24 271)," said
Prosperis, who did not provide comparative data about dengue
occurrence in the region in other years.

In order to combat dengue, the health authorities of Nicaragua carry
out the tasks of elimination of mosquito breeding sites, fumigation,
cleanup of houses and talks to contain the outbreak, with
participation of the military, police, personnel of the Ministry of
Health and volunteers.

Since September [2009], there has been an accumulation of 900 dengue
cases, including 5 deaths, in 3 provinces in northern Dominican
Republic, announced health authorites of this Caribbean country on 13
[Oct 2009]. The dengue outbreak has especially hit children in the
provinces of Santiago, 2nd of the country, Espaillat and Puerto
Plata, according to dispatches form Santo Domingo, the Dominican
capital. Medical sources confirmed that among the deaths there were 3
minors and a pregnant adolescent.

In the opinion of the regional Health Director, Ramon Martinez, the
situation is not alarming. Martinez indicated the the outbreak is
being watched due to the proliferation of the vector, the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito.

The prevention measures put into action include fumigation of
neighborhoods with deficient health conditions and the supervision of
foci in rural areas with the help of Civil Defense.

In 2009, in the Dominican Republic, 2824 people have been infected
with dengue and of these, 17 have died, according to official statistics.

"The dengue monitoring data confirmed that the decline phase of the
epidemic has continued for several weeks," indicated a statement from
the Directorate of Health, which states however, "the return to an
average stable endemic [condition] has not yet been reached. The
epidemic is not over yet."

From the beginning of the epidemic until 11 October [2009], 2531
dengue cases have been laboratory confirmed. For [the past] 2 weeks,
the weekly number of confirmed cases is less than 10. Currently, only
[dengue virus] serotype 4 is circulating in French Polynesia.

Confirmed cases of dengue [virus] 4 [infection] are relatively young
with over half of them under 19 [years].

All the islands are affected by cases of dengue 4 [virus infection].
Furthermore, 79 confirmed cases of dengue have been hospitalized
since the beginning of the epidemic in Polynesian hospitals. [Of
these cases,] 3 of them showed signs of severity (severe dengue) but
recovered without sequelae.

The dreaded mosquito-borne dengue disease continues wreaking havoc in
the city as it claimed yet another life, this time that of a
3-year-old boy, bringing the fatalities for this year to 31.

The latest fatality was brought to the Cebu City Medical Center after
few days of experiencing fever, a move that was discouraged by
medical experts who insist that children should be rushed to the
hospital upon showing signs of fever. The boy died the next day. "The
problem now is that parents won't bring their kids unless the child
is very ill," said Durinda Macasocol, assistant chief of the Cebu
City Epidemiology Statistics and Surveillance Unit.

Although there were already 31 dengue-related deaths recorded in Cebu
City alone from January [2009], this figure is still comparatively
low compared to the 43 deaths for the same period last year. While
there are fewer deaths during the 1st 9 months this year, there are
more dengue cases compared to the same period in 2008. Macasocol said
statistics place dengue infection at 2 persons for every 1000 people
in Cebu City.

The barangays that have dengue-related fatalities are 3 each from
Kamputhaw and Labangon; 2 each from Guadalupe, Tisa, Lorega-San
Miguel, Carreta, Apas and Mambaling; and one each from barangays
Bacayan, Talamban, Basak-San Nicolas, Lahug, Luz, Punta Princesa,
Inayawan, Pardo, Banilad, Day-as, Buhisan, Sudlon II and Binaliw. [A
barangay is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines
and is the local term for a village, district or ward. - Mod.TY]

Cebu City health authorities are closely monitoring 10 barangays that
have the highest number of dengue-related deaths and the most number
of dengue cases last year. Barangay Guadalupe tops the list with 98
dengue cases and 6 deaths followed by Mabolo with 60 dengue cases and
2 deaths and Labangon with 59 dengue cases and 3 deaths in 2008. They
were followed by Tisa with 54 cases and 4 deaths, Basak San Nicolas
with 52 cases and 2 deaths, Inayawan with 51 cases and 3 deaths and
Lahug with 50 dengue cases. Rounding out the list were barangays
Kamputhaw with 47 dengue cases, Talamban with 38 dengue cases and 3
deaths and Bulacao with 36 cases and 2 deaths.

The Cebu City Health Department continuously warns residents against
the mosquito-borne dengue diseases as Macasucol said they have been
implementing its strict measures against the dengue diseases and
urged the public to maintain a clean and mosquito-free surrounding.

The Cebu City Government has been intensifying its campaign against
the deadly mosquito-borne disease dengue and identified 7 satellite
health centers where the public can avail of free dengue screening.
