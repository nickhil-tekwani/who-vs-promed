Salmonellosis was behind an outbreak at HMP (Her Majesty's Prison)
Wandsworth that struck down more than 370 inmates and staff, the
Prison Service has confirmed.

Staff were sent home last Thursday [17 Sep 2009] and visitations were
cancelled while officials from the Department of Health were sent in
to determine the cause of the diarrheal illness. The outbreak brought
London's justice system to a standstill after all court appearances
were suspended for inmates at the prison. The Prison Service revealed
on Tuesday [22 Sep 2009] that salmonella was detected in a number of
samples taken from sick inmates. By then, just 20 inmates and staff
were still suffering from illness.

A Prison Service spokesperson said: "The prison is dealing with this
incident together with local health officials in line with standard
infection control procedures. We would like to reassure the public
that there is minimal risk that this illness could spread from the
prison to the community. As part of the investigation, a small number
of samples were taken from to identify the cause of the illness. Of
these, 14 have now been confirmed as _Salmonella_."
