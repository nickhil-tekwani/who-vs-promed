The Middlesex-London Health Unit says a dead crow found in London has tested positive for West Nile Virus.

The crow, found in the Oxford Street and Wonderland Road area, is the 1st positive bird in Middlesex-London this year [2015].

"This positive bird found in the city reminds us that West Nile Virus is present in our community and that we need to take the steps to protect ourselves and family from mosquito bites," says Jeremy Hogeveen, vector-borne disease coordinator.

"In addition to the Health Unit's increased surveillance in the area, we would like the community to continue to help us combat West Nile virus by eliminating standing water found on their properties."

The health unit has the following tips to protect yourself and your family:
- wearing light coloured clothing with long-sleeves, pants, and socks in areas where mosquitoes are present, especially at dusk and dawn when they are most active;
- using an insect repellent with DEET. Follow directions for use, especially for children;
- fixing holes in screens, windows, and doors;
- regularly emptying standing water from garbage cans, wheelbarrows, toys, flowerpots and saucers, pool covers, tires, and other items around your home and yard;
- cleaning clogged eaves troughs;
- cleaning and changing water in bird baths every other day;
- keeping pool pumps circulating;
- aerating ponds or stocking them with fish;
- covering openings in rain barrels.

[The presence of West Nile virus (WNV) in Europe was first recorded in 1958. Since then, the virus has caused sporadic cases and outbreaks of human and equine disease, predominantly in Southern countries.

WNV circulates in the United Kingdom in resident and migratory birds. Despite its high virulence in birds (especially crows), horses, and alligators in North America, WNV circulates relatively harmlessly in the Old World, presumably reflecting co-evolution of virus and host over a long period (Gould et al. 2006 EID 12: 549-55).
