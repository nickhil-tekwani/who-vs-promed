Foot-and-mouth disease hits Uganda's Jinja cattle
-------------------------------------------------
Uganda's Jinja district authorities have imposed quarantine measures against
the movement of livestock and their products following an outbreak of foot
and mouth disease in Kakira sub-county, the New Vision newspaper reported on
Fri 31 Jan 2003.
The official newspaper did not say how many cattle have been affected, but
quoted a statement from a district veterinary officer as saying that the
disease has been detected in Wairake and Mawoito parishes in Kakira
sub-county, which are located some 10 km northeast of Jinja town. Jinja
district veterinary officer A.K. Sentamu said in a statement that measures
are being taken to control the spread of the disease.
