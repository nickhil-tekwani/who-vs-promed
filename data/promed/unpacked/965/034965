Rural Alaskans continued to experience a high rate of food-borne
infections, including botulism ... 10 cases of botulism were reported
in Alaska in 2007.

All but one of the botulism cases occurred in Southwest Alaska,
according to the state epidemiology section. Each case was traced to
traditionally prepared Alaska Native foods, including specific
problems with fermented beluga, fermented beaver tail, fermented seal
flipper, seal blubber, whale blubber and fermented fish heads. One
person died from botulism.

[Botulism is a rare but serious paralytic illness caused by a nerve
toxin that is produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_.
Foodborne botulism is caused by eating foods that contain the
botulism toxin. Foodborne botulism can be especially dangerous
because many people can be poisoned by eating a contaminated food.

Foodborne botulism has often been from home-canned foods with low
acid content, such as asparagus, green beans, beets and corn.
However, outbreaks of botulism also occur from more unusual sources,
such as chopped garlic in oil, chile peppers, tomatoes, carrot juice,
improperly handled baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil, and
home-canned or fermented fish. Persons who do home canning should
follow strict hygienic procedures to reduce contamination of foods.
Oils infused with garlic or herbs should be refrigerated. Potatoes
which have been baked while wrapped in aluminum foil should be kept
hot until served or refrigerated. Because the botulism toxin is
destroyed by high temperatures, persons who eat home-canned foods
should consider boiling the food for 10 minutes before eating it to
ensure safety; 9 of the 10 botulism cases in Alaska have been from
home-prepared food.
