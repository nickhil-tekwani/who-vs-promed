Update on Polio isolates from Namibia.
------------
Sequence data from PV1 isolate from 1st reported case -- a
39-year-old man from Aranos, Namibia with onset of paralysis 8th May
[2006] -- confirm PV1-SOAS [poliovirus type 1, South Asia] genotype
epidemiologically linked to isolates circulating in India. This
genotype appeared to have been introduced into the African continent
in Angola, neighboring Namibia, in 2005, where it was responsible for
several sporadic cases of poliomyelitis. The Namibian isolate is
closely homologous to ANG-BEN-LOB-05-003 and ANG-BEN-LOB-05-008
isolated from 2 cases of paralytic poliomyelitis in May and June 2005
in the Benguela province of Angola.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Barry Schoub for this first-hand
report on the sequencing data on the poliovirus isolate from the
index case in Namibia.
Aranos is in the southeast of Namibia (see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/namibia_pol90.jpg>) near the
border with Botswana; whereas Benguela province is in Central Western
Angola bordering the Atlantic Ocean (see map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/angola.gif>).
According to the polio eradication website, the date of onset of the
most recent case of polio due to wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in
Angola was 13 Nov 2005, approximately 6 months preceding the date of
onset of the index case in Namibia
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).
Clearly the WPV1 had to have continued circulation during this
6-month interval in either Angola and/or Namibia, prior to the onset
of paralysis in the index case in Namibia.
Again, according to information available on the polioeradication
website
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/features/countryprofiles/AGO2.asp>),
vaccination coverages in Angola are low, with only 45 percent of
children less than one year of age being routinely immunized with 3
doses of polio vaccine (oral polio vaccine -- OPV -- is used in
Angola). In 2005, in response to the polio cases in Angola (there
were a total of 10 reported cases), national immunization days (NIDs)
were conducted in July, August and September in an effort to
interrupt transmission of the WPV. In August 2005, as part of an
appeal for additional funding to conduct the 3rd NID in Angola, the
following 'predictive' warning appeared on the polio eradication website:
"It would be recalled that Angola witnessed one of the largest polio
epidemic outbreaks in Africa in 1999 with about 1117 children
paralyzed and leaving 113 dead. Technical and financial support
provided by the partners over the years enabled the country to become
polio-free since September 2001. The importation of this virus
constitutes a major threat not only to the country but to the entire
region in the drive to interrupt poliovirus transmission by the end
of December 2005. If this transmission is not halted in the next 4
months, Angola would have re-established wild poliovirus
transmission. Failure to halt transmission could also lead to spread
of virus to neighboring countries such as Republic of Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Namibia and Zambia or even beyond the
confines of the sub-region or region." (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/PolioSpecialAlertAugust2005.pdf>)
Information on investigations into possible contact with travellers
from Angola are of interest here. In the absence of a direct history
of travel or contact with known travellers to or from Angola on the
part of this index case suggests that there was some circulation of
the wild poliovirus (WPV) in Namibia prior to the onset of paralysis
of the index case. (As a reminder, there are an average of 200
individuals infected with WPV to every one case of paralytic disease
seen, with a range from a high of 1:50 infected to a low of 1:1000
infected). We await more information on the epidemiologic studies
conducted in Namibia. - Mod.MPP]
