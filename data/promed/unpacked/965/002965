20 000 birds have been killed on a holding in Germany,
Northrhine-Westphalia, Guetersloh after a suspicion was raised by the
owner. He noticed a drop in egg production and elevated mortality.

Meanwhile, avian influenza has been confirmed; test results to
establish whether HPAI or LPAI is present will be available tomorrow
[27 May 2011].

As the clinical signs in the birds were not severe, the authorities
are assuming that the birds have been infected by an LPAI virus.

The department of veterinary and food control of the district
Guetersloh has set up a hotline: Poultry farmers and concerned
citizens can submit questions by phone via 05241/85-1329 or
05241/85-1332.

causative agent, and -- in case AI virus is confirmed -- information
on its pathogenicity and serotype, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
