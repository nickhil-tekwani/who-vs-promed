As part of existing avian influenza response plans, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in conjunction with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, is responding to the identification of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7 of North American wild bird lineage detection in a chicken broiler breeder flock. Further virus characterization including N-type is pending. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States this year [2017]. A comprehensive epidemiological investigation in the surrounding area has begun along with enhanced surveillance and testing. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and implemented movement controls. Depopulation of birds on the premises has been completed.
