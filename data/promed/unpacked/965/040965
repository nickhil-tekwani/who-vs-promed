This is regarding the invitation for "further discussions" on VDPVs in India, and the "cost and logistical implications" of introducing IPV that are "not minor."

There have been 4 children with AFP from whom VDPV type 2 was isolated during 2013. The last 2 got wide media publicity. Possibly 2 children had immune deficiency and had immunodeficiency-associated VDPV, but the other 2 had community acquired VDPV. Naturally transmitted wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV-2) was last isolated in India in 1999. Since then, all vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) due to Sabin type 2 and most of the VDPV cases have been iatrogenic. The number of VAPP cases in India are not counted or, if counted, are not available in the public domain, but we assume about 100 per year and some 40 percent to be due to Sabin-2. VDPV cases are counted and data are available to the public [see http://www.npspindia.org/bulletin.pdf for the 27 Jul 2013 bulletin showing results of polio surveillance activities in India, including information on VDPVs identified by the national reference lab. - Mod.MPP].

Ethics and epidemiology demand that Sabin-2 should no longer be given; the new 2013-2018 Strategic Plan of WHO and GPEI has a new end game strategy, including the switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV without type 2. For risk mitigation of consequences of immunity gaps to type 2, at least one dose of IPV will be required 6 months earlier. Thus, universal IPV introduction in all countries currently giving only OPV will be mandatory. India has a committee to advise the government on this policy shift. Availability and affordability are being explored, but no major problems are anticipated. A few Indian companies with tie ups with European IPV manufacturers have assured India of both supply and low cost, one US dollar or just a bit more than one dollar per dose. All of us are looking forward to the day when we can say polio is truly eradicated, when no child gets infected with polio virus, wild or vaccine.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. T Jacob John for accepting the invitation to discuss this moderator's comment on the vaccine choice in India.

This moderator chose the provocative statement regarding the cost and logistical implications for introduction of IPV not being minor intentionally, as it has historically been the classic response to justify a continuation of the use of OPV and avoid the inevitable switch to IPV. This moderator agrees with Dr. John's statement that "Ethics and epidemiology demand that Sabin-2 should no longer be given." Since the wild poliovirus type 2 (WPV2) had worldwide transmission interrupted in 1999 and has not been responsible for clinical cases of poliomyelitis since 1999, the risk of infection with the virus is zero. In contrast, since 2000, there have been 576 cases of polio reported that are attributable to infection with circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in 14 countries. In 2009/2010, India reported 16 cases of polio due to infection with cVDPV2. (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).

The 2013 Strategic Plan of WHO and GPEI referred to by Dr. John, dated April 2013, can be found at http://www.polioeradication.org/Portals/0/Document/Resources/StrategyWork/EndgameStratPlan_20130409_ENG.pdf. A detailed analysis of the draft was conducted by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) in November 2012. (for more information, see http://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2012/november/news_sage_ipv_opv_nov2012/en/index.html).
