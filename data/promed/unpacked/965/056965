On Wednesday [15 Oct 2014], doctors confirmed to The Express Tribune that 2 people, including a staffer of Roznama Express Newspaper, have died due to [Crimean-] Congo virus in Quetta [Balochistan province].

The death toll from the virus in the city has now risen to 4 over the last 3 months.

The man was admitted to a hospital in Quetta after complaining of ill health. "He was treated for 3 days at Mission Hospital Quetta where doctors were unable to diagnose him with Congo virus," a family member of the man said. Due to deteriorating health, the patient was later shifted to Combined Military Hospital (CMH) where he was diagnosed with the virus. "It was too late to do something to save the patient after he was diagnosed with the fatal virus," family members said.

The man who was in his early 30s, was working in the production department of Century Express Newspaper Quetta.

Another young man died at Fatima Jinnah TB Sanatorium Chest Hospital. "He was brought to Provincial Sandeman Hospital Quetta on Monday [13 Oct 2014] with complaints of bleeding. He was later shifted to an isolated ward of Fatima Jinnah Hospital, where he died on Wednesday [15 Oct 2014]," family members said. Chief Medical Officer Fatima Jinnah TB sanatorium Dr Faiz Hashmi confirmed the death.

In Zhob district [Balochistan province], 4 cases of [Crimean-] Congo virus [infections] were confirmed in August 2014, 2 of whom died.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease that affects both wild and domestic animals and can be passed on to humans.

[The sporadic cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in various parts of Pakistan are continuing this year (2014). These are the 1st cases from Balochistan province reported to ProMED-mail this year (2014). CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.

The individuals described above may have acquired the infection via a tick bite or exposure to the blood of an infected animal. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities also occurs [where infection control procedures are faulty - Mod.JW]. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.
