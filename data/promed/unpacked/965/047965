Hong Kong health officials report investigating a surge in invasive Group B _Streptococcus_ [_Streptococcus agalactiae_] cases. To date, the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) has received reports by the Hospital Authority that 58 and 21 in-patients had tested positive for invasive Group B _Streptococcus_ last month [September 2021] and in October [as of 10 Oct 2021] respectively, showing a surge as compared with a range of 9 to 26 cases per month over the past 3 years (2019 to August 2021).

The 79 cases involve 42 males and 37 females aged from one month to 96 years. They mainly presented with septicemia, meningitis, pyogenic arthritis or abscess/cellulitis.

Investigations show that some of the patients have history of handling freshwater fish, including grass carp, before onset. Some of them had reported handling of raw freshwater fish with hand wounds.

Laboratory analysis has shown that at least 32 cases belonged to serotype III sequence type 283 (ST283) which was of identical genetic sequencing to the fish and environmental samples taken in markets visited by some of the cases. The CHP considers that handling raw freshwater fish with hand wounds or consumption of undercooked freshwater fish may be associated with the infection. In fact, association between consumption of raw freshwater fish and invasive Group B _Streptococcus_ of ST283 has been reported previously in overseas literature. Presence of Group B _Streptococcus_ of ST283 was also reported in freshwater fish in southeast Asia countries [https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/12/17-0596_article].

To prevent Group B _Streptococcus_ infection, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene and should keep their hands clean and practice good wound care at all times, especially:

- Wear gloves while handling raw freshwater fish or seafood and avoid having wounds coming in contact with raw freshwater fish or seafood;
- Avoid eating raw freshwater fish or seafood; and
- Avoid skin contact with dirty water when visiting a wet market and maintain good hand hygiene.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health today [4 Oct 2021] appealed to members of the public for heightened vigilance against invasive Group B _Streptococcus_ and urged them to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene.

The CHP has recently received reports by the Hospital Authority that 51 in-patients had tested positive for invasive _Group B Streptococcus_ last month [September 2021], showing a surge as compared with a range of 9 to 26 cases per month over the past 3 years (2019 - August 2021). They involve 25 males and 26 females aged from one month to 96 years.

The spokesman said, "According to literature, the route of transmission of invasive Group B Streptococcal disease is mostly unclear. More commonly known route includes mother-to-child transmission. Overseas literature also reported that it relates to eating or improper handling of contaminated food. People who feel unwell should consult a doctor promptly."

The CHP's epidemiological investigations on the above cases are ongoing to identify the possible sources of infection.

To prevent diseases, members of the public are reminded to maintain personal, food and environmental hygiene and should keep their hands clean and practice good wound care at all times:

- Always wash hands before eating and after going to the toilet;
- Avoid eating raw seafood;
- Handle raw and cooked foods carefully and separate them completely during the cooking process;
- Use 2 sets of chopsticks and utensils to handle raw and cooked food;
- Wash hands with liquid soap and water properly whenever possibly contaminated;
- Cleanse a wound thoroughly and cover it with a waterproof dressing;
- Keep the kitchen and cooking utensils clean; and
- Dispose of rubbish properly.

Abstract
--------
"We assessed microbial safety and quality of raw fish sold in Singapore during 2015-2016 to complement epidemiologic findings for an outbreak of infection with group B _Streptococcus_ serotype III sequence type (ST) 283 associated with raw fish consumption. Fish-associated group B _Streptococcus_ ST283 strains included strains nearly identical (0-2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) with the human outbreak strain, as well as strains in another distinct ST283 clade (57-71 single-nucleotide polymorphisms). Our investigations highlight the risk for contamination of freshwater fish (which are handled and distributed separately from saltwater fish sold as sashimi) and the need for improved hygienic handling of all fish for raw consumption. These results have led to updated policy and guidelines regarding the sale of ready-to-eat raw fish dishes in Singapore."

Also, the citation and abstract of a 2016 publication concerning invasive disease caused by group B _Streptococcus_ serotype III, subtype 4, sequence type [ST] 283 in in 48 patients in Hong Kong between 1995 and 2012 follows below:

Citation: Ip M, Ang I, Fung K, Liyanapathirana V, Luo M, Lai R. Hypervirulent Clone of Group B _Streptococcus_ Serotype III Sequence Type 283, Hong Kong, 1993-2012. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016;22(10):1800-1803. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2210.151436

Abstract
--------
"We describe a hypervirulent clone of group B _Streptococcus_ serotype III, subtype 4, sequence type [ST] 283, that caused invasive disease with a predilection for meningitis in Hong Kong during 1993-2012. The organism is associated with high mortality and increased summer prevalence and is linked to diseased fish from freshwater fish farms."

Prior ProMED posts (see also's below) reported outbreaks of invasive infections due to group B _Streptococcus_ (GBS, also called _Streptococcus agalactiae_) serotype III sequence type (ST) 283 that sickened people in Singapore in 2015 through 2020. These outbreaks were linked to eating GBS-contaminated raw fish in "yusheng", a popular dish at hawker centers (food courts), where raw fish is marinated in sesame oil and garnished with red chili and ginger. The dish typically is made from 2 freshwater fish species, Asian bighead carp and snakehead.

GBS ST283 that caused these foodborne outbreaks of invasive disease in Singapore were reported to be widespread in humans and aquaculture in South East Asia; only 4 cases of GBS ST283 were said to be reported outside Asia (see ProMED-mail post Strep. Group B - Singapore: serotype III, ST283, invasive, foodborne, raw fish 20180719.5914097).

Because freshwater fish were found to have significantly higher bacterial contamination than saltwater fish, the Singapore National Environment Agency (NEA) banned the use of all freshwater fish in ready-to-eat raw fish dishes in December 2015. Food stalls, including those at hawker centers, coffee shops, and food courts were required to stop all sales of raw saltwater fish as well until they have shown that they can comply with the practices required for handling raw fish. Fish intended for raw consumption were required to go through appropriate cold chain management practices, handled hygienically throughout the supply chain, and kept separate from other fish intended for cooking to avoid cross contamination (https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/nea-bans-use-of-all-freshwater-fish-in-ready-to-eat-raw-fish-dishes-from-dec-5).

GBS are Gram-positive cocci that produce beta-hemolysis when cultured on sheep blood agar. Streptococci are classified into several groups based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharide. GBS colonize the vagina and gastrointestinal tract in healthy women, with carriage rates ranging from 15-45% and can cause chorioamnionitis, post-partum endometritis, and sepsis in pregnant women and pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis in newborns following vaginal delivery in mothers with vaginal GBS colonization at the time of delivery.

GBS have been found to colonize the urethra in both men and women and can also colonize the gastrointestinal tract and upper respiratory tract; they are increasingly recognized as an invasive pathogen in diabetics and the elderly, causing sepsis, pneumonia, skin and soft-tissue infection (such as decubitus ulcers and diabetic foot infections), urinary tract infections, endocarditis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, peritonitis, and endophthalmitis (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/6/839.long).

GBS are also found in other animals including fish, cattle, horses, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice. The strains that cause disease in humans, however, were said to be usually biochemically, metabolically, or serologically different from strains that cause disease in other animals (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/streptococcosis.pdf).

However, GBS multilocus sequence type (MLST) ST-283, serotype III-4 with similar genotypes has been detected both in fish and in adult humans with invasive GBS disease in Southeast Asia, establishing an epidemiological connection (1-4), as previously described for another aquatic streptococcal pathogen, _Streptococcus iniae_, which occasionally causes invasive infection in humans (5).
