Hundreds of villagers experienced sudden paralysis. They were in turn
attacked by the illness chikungunya. Although not yet causing fatalities,
fear of this illness has gripped local residents.

Unfortunately, although it has attacked hundreds of residents, until now
this has not prompted special action by the Tulungagung Health Service
either in the form of preventive action or medical handling. Casualties
attacked by the plague chikungunya must take medicine at personal cost by
buying special medicine or take medicine at the closest community health
centre.

Cases of this kind continued to spread as far as several other villages
like Brangus, Cangkring, and Karang.
