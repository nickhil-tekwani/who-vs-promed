Birds / 26 290 / 10 004 / 9883 / - / -
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:

Birds / 38.05 / 37.59 / 98.79 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: abnormal mortalities in 4 goose farms in Yunlin County and an acute egg drop syndrome in a layer duck farm in Pingtung County were noticed early January 2015. Local disease control center staff went to these farms to conduct movement restrictions and clinical inspection and then sent dead geese and layer ducks samples to the National Laboratory for diagnosis. Specific RNA product of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N2 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza strain was confirmed by the National Laboratory based on sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. It is worth noting that H and N genes of these isolates are different from the H5N2 strains previously isolated in Taiwan. The homology of H5 between the isolates from these infected farms and the South Korea 2014 H5N8 strain is near 99 percent. The homology of N2 between the isolates from these infected farms and the China 2011 H5N2 strain is 96 percent. This H5N2 strain is obviously novel to Taiwan. All the geese and ducks on the infected farm will be culled. The actual number of culled geese and ducks will be available when stamping out will finish and be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km [2 mi] radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (AHRI) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Birds / gene sequencing / 11 Jan 2015 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 11 Jan 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Xinpi Township, Pingtung County
Date of start of the outbreak: 6 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: upon request from central competent authority, local disease control center staff took samples from 3 dead chickens and sent them to the National Laboratory (Animal Health Research Institute, AHRI) on 6 Jan 2015. H5N2 subtype HPAI was detected and confirmed by the AHRI on 9 Jan 2015. When the staff went to the infected farm for investigation on 6 Jan 2015, the farm record indicated that there was an abnormal mortality mid December 2014. All the chickens within the infected farm have been put under movement restrictions and will be culled. The actual number of culled chickens will be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3 km [2 mi] radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

[Taiwan has reported 2 events of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza to the OIE. This officially confirms the information reported in ProMED-mail archive number 20150112.3087008.

Of the 2 reported events, noteworthy is the information described in item [1] above, where the affected population involved domestic ducks and geese in Yunlin and Pingtung counties. Based on what is mentioned in the epidemiological comment: "Specific RNA product of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N2 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza strain was confirmed by the National Laboratory based on sequencing analysis of HA0 cleavage site. It is worth noting that H and N genes of these isolates are different from the H5N2 strains previously isolated in Taiwan. The homology of H5 between the isolates from these infected farms and the South Korea 2014 H5N8 strain is near 99 percent. The homology of N2 between the isolates from these infected farms and the China 2011 H5N2 strain is 96 percent. This H5N2 strain is obviously novel to Taiwan."

The morbidity, mortality, and case fatality rates are also good indicators of a more virulent strain.

On the other hand, the H5N2 strain isolated from the event in Pingtung County described in item [2] above and which involved layer chickens, although it is not indicated, could be associated with a strain previously isolated in Taiwan and not associated with the novel strain.

As moderator AS pointed out in his comment in ProMED-mail archive no 20150112.3087008, it would be of great interest to compare this novel strain H5N2 and the HPAI H5N2 recombinant strain reported by Canada. So the question posed by Mod AS remains, "Is the Taiwan outbreak a reflection of the apparent intercontinental spread of the current Eurasian lineage highly pathogenic H5 virus by wild birds?" - Mod.CRD]

[The reported close H5 homology between the isolates from the infected domestic ducks and geese in Yunlin and Pingtung counties (item 1 above) and the South Korea 2014 H5N8 strain ("near 99 percent") may reflect their identity as the new H5 clade 2.3.4.4. Korea's 2014 isolates A/Baikal teal, A/broiler duck, and A/chicken were reported by the WHO as belonging to this clade. See Mod.CP'S commentary in posting 20150114.3090250 and figure 1 "Phylogenetic relationships of A(H5) clade 2.3.4 HA genes" at http://www.who.int/influenza/vaccines/virus/201409_zoonotic_vaccinevirusupdate.pdf (2.3.4.6 in the upper side of the dendrogram was used as a provisional nomenclature; as advised in posting 20150114.3090250, it should now read 2.3.4.4). - Mod.AS
