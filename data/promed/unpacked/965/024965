An anthrax outbreak in humans has resurfaced in Gutu district in Masvingo,
with 5 cases having been reported since the beginning of last week and
reports that the disease has claimed one person in the district. Health
officials in Gutu said they were still investigating the death of one
person who died recently after eating some beef suspected to have been
contaminated with anthrax.
The resurgence of anthrax in Gutu comes a few months after the province had
successfully managed to tame the disease that had also resulted in the
death of hundreds of livestock, mainly cattle.
The acting Masvingo provincial medical director Dr Charles Sandy last
Friday confirmed that there had been an outbreak of anthrax in Gutu that
had affected 5 people so far. "There has been another outbreak of anthrax
in humans in Gutu, and we are closely monitoring the situation, as the
whole district is affected. However, since the beginning of the week about
5 cases of anthrax have been reported in humans and we are dealing with the
situation. We are also investigating one death that occurred in Gutu
because the person might have died of the disease, but at the moment we are
still investigating the cause of the death," said Dr Sandy.
He said the disease was more rampant in Bhasera and Chingombe communal
lands, where it had wreaked havoc and had killed a lot of cattle. Dr Sandy
said they had enough stocks of anthrax drugs to treat people infected by
the deadly disease, adding that they were currently carrying out
educational campaigns to teach villagers about the dangers of anthrax. He
said the major cause of anthrax in humans was the consumption of beef from
cattle that would have died of the disease. Hundreds of cattle had been
dying of anthrax in Gutu recently.
Most districts in Masvingo province have since 2004 been losing cattle and
sometimes human lives to anthrax.
Early in 2005, the Veterinary Department was forced to impose an indefinite
quarantine on the movement of cattle in Chivi as a result of the disease.
The quarantine has since been lifted after anthrax had been contained.

[Readers will note that ProMED has been reporting anthrax in Masvingo
Province since December 2003, and there are anecdotal reports of it being
there in 2000. Obviously the livestock control procedures lack 100 percent
efficacy. With the ongoing government funding problems in that country, the
present disease situation can only continue or get worse. - Mod.MHJ]
