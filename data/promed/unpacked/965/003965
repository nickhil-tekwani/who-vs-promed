[ProMED thanks Dr. Berger for this, another one of his interesting and informative comments.

CCHF virus is widely distributed geographically, ranging from the Indian subcontinent, south and central Asia, eastern Europe (including western Russia) and into Africa. It is not surprising that travelers who visit endemic areas outside of cities or who are in contact with local animals become exposed to the virus and infected with it, becoming ill on their return to their home countries. Making an accurate diagnosis by physicians in their home countries would be a challenge. Taking good travel histories in these cases is essential, not only for making the diagnosis but for implementing measures to prevent transmission from the patient to health care workers. Given rapid international air travel, individuals infected with this virus can turn up anywhere in the world. - Mod.TY
