The International Rescue Committee (IRC) is responding to a rare
outbreak of yellow fever which has so far claimed almost 50 lives in
northern Uganda. To help curb the spread of the disease and treat
those already infected, the IRC is training Ugandan health workers
and community volunteers in the northern districts of Kitgum and
Lamwo to detect, refer and treat the disease and is providing drugs,
disinfectants, and protective gear including gloves and masks.

The IRC will also assist in a government-run vaccination campaign
that that will reach 2.5 million people in Uganda's northern
districts. Meanwhile, an IRC ambulance is carrying patients from
isolated communities to hospitals. When the vaccination campaign
begins later this month [January 2011], IRC health teams will help
transport vaccines from storage facilities to inoculation sites.

Dr. Alex Opio Chono, who directs the IRC's health programs in Uganda,
said that the IRC is now focused on promoting preventative hygiene,
bringing information to the public, and strengthening community
involvement in detecting and reporting symptoms of yellow fever. "Our
teams are travelling around the countryside, informing people about
yellow fever and where they can receive inoculations," Dr. Chono
said. "In collaboration with the district health authorities, we are
also launching an information campaign with posters, radio spots,
radio talk shows and community meetings."

Yellow fever, [caused by a virus] transmitted by infected mosquitoes,
was last recorded in Uganda almost 40 years ago, according to health
officials. The disease has a wide range of symptoms from nausea and
vomiting to jaundice, bleeding and kidney failure. About half of
those who develop severe symptoms and are untreated die from the disease.

The outbreak is affecting an area still recovering from 2 decades of
civil war between the rebel Lord's Resistance Army and the Ugandan
government. "The war destroyed many health facilities, and there is a
severe shortage of trained medical staff, making this area
particularly ill-equipped to handle an outbreak of such a serious
disease," said Cristine Betters, the IRC director in Uganda.

[The disruption of medical services and lack of trained personnel may
account for the difficulty experienced in making a valid diagnosis
early in this outbreak. The above report does not indicate when the
vaccination campaign will begin. The IRC's transportation of the
vaccine, when it does become available, should insure proper handling
of it so that it retains its potency. Meanwhile, one hopes that
efforts to implement preventive measures, especially elimination of
_Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquito breeding sites, will significantly
reduce the risk of yellow fever virus transmission.
