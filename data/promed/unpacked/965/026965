Blackleg, [caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_] a disease fatal to young
cattle if left untreated, has broken out in the province's Peace River region.
"Basically, it's followed from the Alberta border to the Fellers Heights
road," said Barry Ross of the Dawson Creek veterinarian clinic. Dr. Ross
said he has seen about 10 herds affected since February, with one producer
suffering an uninsured loss of at least $50 000.
Blackleg usually occurs in calves between 2 and 6 months of age. The
infecting bacteria release lethal toxins that damage the muscles and turn
them black.

[Blackleg is an acute febrile disease of cattle and sheep caused by
_Clostridium chauvoei (feseri) characterized by emphysematous swelling,
usually in the heavy muscles. It is found worldwide.
*Clostridium chauvoei_ occurs naturally in the intestinal tract of animals.
It probably can remain viable in the soil for many years, although it does
not actively grow there. Contaminated pasture appears to be a source of the
organisms. Outbreaks of blackleg have occurred in cattle on farms in which
recent excavations have occurred, which suggests that disturbance of soil
may activate latent spores. The organisms probably are ingested, pass
through the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, and after gaining access to
the blood stream, are deposited in muscle and other tissues.
In cattle, blackleg infection is endogenous, in contrast to malignant
edema. Lesions develop without any history of wounds, although bruising or
excessive exercise may precipitate some cases.
Usually onset is sudden and some are found death with out premonitory
signs. Acute lameness and marked depression are common. Characteristic
edematous and crepitant swellings develop in the hip, shoulder, chest,
back, neck or elsewhere.
A rapidly fatal, febrile disease in well-nourished young cattle,
particularly in the beef breeds, with crepitant swellings of the heavy
muscles suggest blackleg. The affected muscle is dark red to black and dry
and spongy; it has a sweetish odor and is infiltrated with small bubbles
but with little edema.
A bacterin containing _C. chauvoei_ and _C. septicum_ is safe and reliable
for both cattle and sheep. Calves should be vaccinated twice, 2 weeks
apart, between 2 and 6 months of age. Revaccination at a year is
recommended and may be recommended at different intervals in high risk
areas. - Mod.TG]
