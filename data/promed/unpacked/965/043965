Sick raccoons are being euthanized in Blount County, Alcoa and Maryville [Tennessee; TN] and, although the animals may appear to be rabid, officials say a disease called distemper is the more likely culprit.

While ill raccoons have been reported by animal control officers in all 3 jurisdictions, Alcoa appears to be the only area seeing a major increase over prior years. Alcoa animal control officer Jerry Harrison said they typically only euthanize 2 or 3 ill raccoons each year. In March alone [2017], they had to euthanize about 17 or 18, he said. "We do this every year, but this year it's been an epidemic," Harrison told The Daily Times. Harrison said the ill animals typically have distemper, though rabies is a remote possibility. Symptoms of the 2 diseases are similar, so it's hard to tell just by looking, he said.

The United States Department of Agriculture is testing the animals, though the results are still pending.

Harrison said raccoons with distemper are fairly common and Alcoa has dealt with them for a number of years. "They acted the same way as the ones we're killing now," Harrison said. The strange behavior of infected raccoons includes being out in the day, walking in circles or lying on the ground. They might also be foaming from the mouth, even if suffering from distemper and not rabies, Harrison said.

The animals have been recovered all over Alcoa, including Topside Road, the Springbrook area, Alcoa Highway and East Lincoln Road, Harrison said.

Maryville animal control sergeant Eddie King said his department has only trapped 1 ill raccoon this year [2017]. It was captured in the West Broadway Avenue area near the Royal Oaks subdivision one-week-ago [Fri 31 Mar 2017], he said. Maryville is also waiting testing from the USDA to determine if the animal had rabies or distemper, King said. Like Harrison, King said distemper is the more likely result. "Most of the time, it's going to be distemper, and it kind of mimics the rabies -- the tremors, things like that," he said. "It's probably going to be distemper, but we won't know until the testing is done."

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. Distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness'; they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'.

Animals showing the same signs might be rabid, but in this case distemper might be more likely as rabies tests turned out negative. It is very important to make sure the vaccination schemes of all dogs, cats and ferrets in the area are up to date. - Mod.PMB
