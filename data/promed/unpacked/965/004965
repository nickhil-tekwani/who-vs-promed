RABIES, CANINE, HUMAN - KAZAKHSTAN

One person died from rabies in the city of Dzhetysay, southern Kazakstan,
after his whole family was bitten by his dog. The dog was tested and not
found to have rabies, but the family was given the shots, and only one
member died. In the region, 400 people have been seen for animal bites. 207
animals were found to have rabies. Doctors think the disease came from
Uzbekistan via stray dogs.
