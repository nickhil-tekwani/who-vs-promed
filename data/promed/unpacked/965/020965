Another Sierra Leone doctor has died from Ebola, the 10th to succumb to the disease, according to a health official. His death on Sat [6 Dec 2104], as confirmed by Brima Kargbo, the country's chief medical officer, came a day after 2 other [Sierra Leonean] doctors died from Ebola. He worked at a children's hospital in the capital Freetown and tested positive for Ebola about 2 weeks ago... - more

[3] Guinea: protest against construction of new Ebola clinic
Date: 5 Dec 2014

Dozens of youths in the Guinean capital Conakry staged an angry protest against a new Ebola treatment center on Thu [5 Dec 2014], halting the launch of the construction project, according to an AFP reporter on the scene. Prime Minister Mohamed Said Fofana was about to lay the symbolic 1st stone for the clinic when a crowd appeared, chanting slogans in Susu, a local language. "We do not want Ebola in our neighborhood! We fear Ebola! Do not pollute our environment," they shouted.

Guinean officials tried to talk down the ringleaders as the gathered dignitaries left, but the protesters escalated their demonstration, wrecking a gazebo, and scattering chairs and sound equipment. Representatives from medical aid agency Doctors Without Borders [MSF], which was slated to run the center, were evacuated along with a few remaining dignitaries. A source from the charity said it would take advice from the government before deciding whether to proceed with the project...

The Red Cross and Red Crescent said suspicion among locals across the region remained a major hurdle in battling the outbreak, with volunteers frequently encountering hostility. Foreign aid workers delivering medical assistance in already difficult conditions have frequently been confronted with wild theories placing them at the center of a global conspiracy to harvest the blood and organs of black Africans. The enmity has at times escalated into serious unrest, with treatment centers in Guinea and Liberia raided by mobs shouting that Ebola was a fiction invented by "white governments." The violence reached a gruesome nadir when 3 journalists working as part of an Ebola outreach team were murdered by villagers in southern Guinea in September [2014].

[4] Liberia: new hotspots in capital
Date: Date: Fri 5 Dec 2014
Source: APA [edited]
http://en.starafrica.com/news/liberia-fresh-ebola-outbreaks-reported-in-monrovia.html


Health authorities in Monrovia have reported a fresh outbreak of the Ebola virus in several communities in the capital Monrovia. The head of the Ebola Incident Management Team at the health ministry, Tolbert Nyenswah, named communities currently considered hotspots of Ebola in the country as New KruTown and Clara Town in western Monrovia and the northern Monrovia suburb of Barnersville.

Mr. Nyenswah told journalists in Monrovia on Fri 5 Dec 2014 that Ebola Treatment Units in Monrovia are registering between 10 and 15 confirmed cases of the disease every day. He attributed the increase in new cases to the complacency of residents due to the reported decrease in Ebola cases in the country in late October [2014] and the refusal of people to adhere to preventive measures outlined by health authorities to contain the spread of the disease.

He disclosed that Liberians have once again returned to unsafe burial practices in Montserrado County [the county of Monrovia], saying that unlike in the past, family members of deceased persons have on numerous occasions refused to turn over the corpses of their dead relatives to the Ebola Burial Team, noting that this partly accounts for the increase in new cases in the county. He said, under the circumstances, it would be impossible to meet President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's target of zero cases by Christmas [2014].

He also disclosed that Montserrado, Bong, Margibi and Grand Cape Mount counties are the counties in Liberia experiencing fresh outbreaks of Ebola, but said everything is being done by health authorities and partners to bring the situation under control.

[5] Blood plasma to treat Ebola
Date: Fri 5 Dec 2014
Source: WSJ [edited]
http://online.wsj.com/articles/ebola-survivors-in-africa-offer-new-treatment-hope-their-blood-1417821483


Nearly a year after Ebola began spreading in West Africa, and with a proven drug or vaccine still far off, researchers are launching clinical trials on a product at hand: the blood plasma of survivors. They want to determine whether convalescent plasma can help fight off the disease. But they face a number of complexities in carrying out the trials, including persuading survivors to participate.

It took months for scientists and public-health experts to agree to study survivors' blood plasma as a possible treatment, and months more to work out how to attract participants, collect blood plasma, and design ethically sound trials among patients with a deadly disease. The World Health Organization issued guidance in September 2014 for collecting and transfusing blood plasma from survivors. "This is not a simple intervention," said Alan Magill, who steers Ebola research-and-development investments for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is spending USD 5.7 million on clinical trials of potential treatments, including blood plasma, in Guinea and other Ebola-affected countries. "It requires complex tools and very skilled people," he said.

Belgium's Institute of Tropical Medicine is also setting up trials in Guinea. Blood plasma transfusions have been used for tetanus and have been tried on some Ebola patients in past outbreaks, as well as in the current epidemic. But few studies have been done on its effect on the virus, and the recovery from the illness, and the results are mixed.

In the Gates-funded trials in Conakry [Guinea], donors who have been free of Ebola for at least 28 days will be recruited through survivors' groups and donor lists maintained by hospitals, said David Hoover, senior scientific adviser for Clinical Research Management Inc. an Ohio-based company that is designing and helping manage the trials. Blood from the participants will be put through a device that extracts plasma, the liquid part of the blood that contains antibodies against Ebola. Another device will then inactivate other viruses or bacteria that may be in the plasma, such as HIV, so that infections aren't inadvertently transmitted. The resulting plasma will then be given to patients who agree to participate and whose blood type matches that of the donors. "We expect that demand for convalescent plasma from recovered Ebola patients will significantly exceed supply," Dr. Hoover said. Researchers will measure the effect of the plasma by tracking the level of virus in recipients' blood, he said. They will compare it with patients in the trial who don't receive plasma because they don't match the blood type of donors, he said. All participants will receive a high standard of care, he said.

Some Guinean officials worry that a bidding war could emerge to attract survivors who are jobless or feel shunned by their communities. Guinea's government has said that, with support from international donors, it would grant USD 10 000 to the families of the more than 40 health workers who have died from Ebola, but hasn't announced any specific plan for survivors.

"We want to see cooperation, not competition," said Mandy Kader Konde, the head of Guinea's Ebola Research Commission. "You can't monetize blood drawing; it must remain free." Donors in the Gates-funded trial won't be paid for their plasma, but they will be compensated for their time and reimbursed for travel expenses, said Dr. Hoover. The Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium has dispatched an anthropologist to Guinea to study what compensation would be appropriate, said Johan van Griensven, who coordinates its Ebola research program. Ebola survivors should receive support irrespective of the study, he said.

Some survivors are eager to help and to persuade others to join in. Bakary Oulare, a doctor who recovered from Ebola in the spring, founded an association in Guinea that counts more than 130 survivors. He said most of them stand ready to have their plasma used in trials provided they receive compensation. "I'll be the 1st to do it," he said. "I want to show the way."

In Liberia, many of the more than 100 Ebola survivors who meet weekly in the capital of Monrovia say they are eager to donate plasma to transfusion programs getting underway at a state-run hospital and national blood bank. But plans to expand the program have been slowed by some of the same challenges that allowed the epidemic to overwhelm Liberia's primitive health-care system a few months ago. ... - more
