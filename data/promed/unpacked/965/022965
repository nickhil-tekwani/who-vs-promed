Wisconsin DHS Health alert no. 42: Recommendations for adenovirus testing and reporting of children with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory to notify clinicians and public health authorities of a recent increase in cases of acute hepatitis and adenovirus infection in children.

From November 2021 to February 2022, clinicians at a large children's hospital in Alabama identified 9 pediatric patients with significant liver injury, including 3 with acute liver failure, who also tested positive for adenovirus. All children were previously healthy. All 5 of the 9 specimens that were sequenced had adenovirus type 41 infection identified. 2 patients required liver transplant; no patients died. Since being notified of this adenovirus-associated hepatitis cluster, DHS is now investigating at least 4 similar cases among children in Wisconsin. This includes 2 children who had severe outcomes, 1 liver transplant, and 1 fatality.

Background
----------
A possible association between pediatric hepatitis and adenovirus infection in children who tested negative for hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E is currently under investigation worldwide. This Health Alert serves to notify American clinicians who may encounter pediatric patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology to consider adenovirus testing and to elicit reporting of such cases to state public health authorities and to the CDC. Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT, e.g., PCR) is preferred for adenovirus detection and may be performed on respiratory specimens, stool, rectal swabs, or blood.

CDC issued an official Health Advisory describing a cluster of cases in Alabama and provided recommendations for testing and reporting on 21 Apr 2022. The WHO has also published a Disease Outbreak News report on 23 Apr 2022 describing 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology, of these, adenovirus had been detected in at least 74 cases.

Clinical
--------
Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that can be caused by viral infections, alcohol use, toxins, medications, and certain other medical conditions. In the USA, the most common causes of viral hepatitis are hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses. Signs and symptoms of hepatitis include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, light-colored stools, joint pain, and jaundice. Treatment of hepatitis depends on the underlying etiology. Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses that spread by close personal contact, respiratory droplets, and fomites. There are more than 50 types of immunologically distinct adenoviruses that can cause infections in humans. Adenoviruses most commonly cause respiratory illness. However, some adenovirus types can cause other illnesses, such as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, cystitis, and, less commonly, neurological disease.

There is no specific treatment for adenovirus infections. Adenovirus type 41 commonly causes pediatric acute gastroenteritis, which typically presents as diarrhea, vomiting, and fever; it can often be accompanied by respiratory symptoms. While there have been case reports of hepatitis in immunocompromised children with adenovirus type 41 infection, adenovirus type 41 is not known to be a cause of hepatitis in otherwise healthy children.

Recommendations
---------------
Clinicians should consider adenovirus testing in pediatric patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology. NAAT (e.g., PCR) is preferable and may be done on respiratory specimens, stool or rectal swabs, or blood. Anecdotal reports suggest that testing whole blood by PCR may be more sensitive than testing plasma by PCR; therefore, testing of whole blood could be considered in those without an etiology who tested negative for adenovirus in plasma samples. If patients are still under medical care or have residual specimens available, please save and freeze specimens for possible additional testing and contact DHS at 608-267-9003.

Clinical criteria for case reporting
------------------------------------
- Children under age 16, presenting with hepatitis of unknown etiology (with or without any adenovirus testing results) since 1 Jan 2021, AND elevated liver function tests (that is, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >500 U/L).
- Suspect cases should be reported to public health electronically via the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) and selecting "hepatitis unknown" as the disease type, or by contacting DHS at 608-267-9003.

Regarding hepatitis of unknown cause, which has been mainly in young children in Europe and the USA, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has revealed that 2 new children under the age of 16 have been hospitalized with similar symptoms in Japan. There are now 3 patients with unexplained severe hepatitis confirmed in Japan.

According to the WHO, there have been a series of reports of acute hepatitis in 12 countries, including the UK and the USA, mainly in children under the age of 10, with at least 169 cases reported as of 21 Apr 2022, one died.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced on 25 Apr 2022 that a patient with a possible cause of hepatitis of unknown cause was confirmed for the 1st time, and the number of patients confirmed in Japan is now 3. The relationship between these 3 children has not been clarified. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is requesting local governments nationwide to report any patients with similar symptoms and is collecting information on the situation overseas.

Ryo Sumazaki, Honorary Director of Ibaraki Prefectural Children's Hospital, a pediatric doctor who is familiar with liver diseases in children, said, "Mild hepatitis generally occurs in children, but cases requiring liver transplantation or liver failure are rare. However, it is still unclear whether the same thing as in Europe and the USA, which has been reported one after another, will occur in Japan. In children, hepatitis A to E does not [generally] apply, and acute hepatitis of unknown cause often occurs. It is necessary for the country and experts to carefully investigate whether the number of cases is increasing, but at this point, generally, parents do not have to worry excessively.

Also, regarding the fact that adenovirus is detected in many children with acute hepatitis in Europe and the USA, he said "Adenovirus itself is a common virus, so even if it is detected in a patient, it cannot be immediately determined that it is the cause. However, adenovirus often spreads not only through the air but also by contact infection, so I want you to wash your hands thoroughly."

A case of acute hepatitis of unknown origin has to do with a girl 4.5 years old and has already been reported to the relevant European bodies by the Makarios Children's Hospital.

The chief of the pediatrics division at Makarios hospital, Avraam Elia, said that a young child was diagnosed back in February [2022] with acute hepatitis of unexplained origin, as cases emerge across the world. He noted that the case had been reported as unexplained hepatitis. "Lab work that was done on the child yielded no correlation with a cause of hepatitis," Elia said.

More cases of severe hepatocellular injury in children are being reported with many reported on a review of previous cases. Cases apparently fitting the clinical case definition have come from at least 12 European countries, the USA (now 5 states), Japan (now 3 cases), and Cyprus (1 case) to this point and are likely to increase.

Adenovirus serotype 41, one of the so-called enteric adenoviruses, has been found in some of the cases, but the virus has not been known previously to cause hepatitis in the immunologically normal host. Whether the finding of adenovirus serotype 41 is an epiphenomenon or the virus is etiologic here is not yet known. No information has yet been forthcoming on evidence that the virus was found in liver tissue or not, whether a whole genomic analysis of the virus has been compared to older adenovirus serotype 41 and the specific pathology of the affected liver has not been reported. If the virus is the cause, has the agent acquired additional virulence factors, or is a cofactor involved (virus or toxin)? Are certain children genetically more susceptible for the more severe disease?

To this point, no evidence for household clusters has been reported, which one might expect if a foodborne toxin or transmissible agent was involved. Additionally, it would be interesting to know if any asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations were looked for in household contacts. The cases recognized as severe could be the "tip of the iceberg," as we saw with paralytic poliomyelitis when only a small percentage of infections resulted in the classical asymmetrical flaccid paralysis of polio. Additionally, it is not clear whether all these cases are related to the same cause. Also, most of the newer reported cases do not specifically say that the case fits the proposed case definition. - Mod.LL]
