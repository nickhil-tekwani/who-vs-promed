["The Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infects domestic and wild birds, having been described in at least 241 species. NDV is an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus within the family of Paramyxoviridae, genus _Avulavirus_. There are 10 serotypes of avian paramyxoviruses named APMV-1 to APMV-10; NDV is known as APMV-1. Depending upon the disease signs and lesions in chickens, NDV can be classified into 4 groups/pathotypes: apathogenic (avirulent), low virulent (lentogenic), moderately virulent (mesogenic), highly virulent (velogenic).

Newcastle disease, caused by NDV, is one of the most important diseases of poultry around the globe. Currently, ND is present in 6 of the 7 continents of the world and remains endemic in many countries of Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Central America, and in several parts of South America."

"NDV is a human pathogen, and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or 2."
