Update: Investigation of rabies infections in organ donor and
transplant recipients in Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas, 2004
-----------------------------------------------
On 1 Jul 2004, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
reported laboratory confirmation of rabies as the cause of
encephalitis in an organ donor and 3 organ recipients at Baylor
University Medical Center (BUMC) in Dallas, Texas (1). Hospital and
public health officials in Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas
initiated public health investigations to identify donor and
recipient contacts, assess exposure risks, and provide rabies
post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). As of 9 Jul 2004, PEP had been
initiated in approximately 174 (19 percent) of 916 persons who had
been assessed for exposures to the organ recipients or the donor.
As a result of its public health investigation, the Arkansas
Department of Health determined that the donor had reported being
bitten by a bat (Frank Wilson, M.D., Arkansas Department of Health,
personal communication, 2004).
On 7 Jul 2004, the CDC was notified of an additional organ transplant
patient at BUMC who had died of encephalopathy of unknown origin in
early June 2004. This case was detected as part of an ongoing review
of transplant-patient autopsies. The patient, who had end-stage liver
disease, had received a liver transplant at BUMC in early May 2004.
The patient remained hospitalized, with transplant-related
complications, and began having neurologic abnormalities in early
June 2004, progressing to seizure, coma, and death. On 7 Jul 2004,
pathologists at BUMC identified intracytoplasmic inclusions,
suggestive of rabies, in neurons in multiple areas of the brain.
Specimens from the recipient were sent to the CDC on 7 Jul 2004, and
direct fluorescent antibody and immunohistochemical staining
procedures confirmed the presence of rabies viral antigens in
multiple areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, midbrain,
pons, medulla, and cerebellum. Similar to the findings with the 3
previously known rabies-infected transplant recipients, preliminary
antigenic characterization of the agent was consistent with a rabies
virus variant associated with insectivorous bats. On 8 Jul 2004, CDC
laboratory testing of tissues and serum from the donor who provided
the liver yielded no evidence of infection with rabies virus.
Review of surgical procedures at BUMC determined that a segment of
iliac artery, recovered from the donor subsequently determined to
have rabies, had been stored at the facility for future use in liver
transplants. This artery segment subsequently was used in the
transplantation of the liver in the most recently identified
rabies-infected recipient. Investigation of rabies transmission
sources is ongoing, although current evidence suggests that the
artery segment originating from the rabies-infected donor likely is
the source of the latest rabies infection. Identification of contacts
of this liver recipient is under way, and initiation of PEP when
indicated, or, as appropriate, is in progress.

[The transmission of rabies virus via a piece of artery tissue from
an infected donor, which was employed to assist transplantation of an
organ from an uninfected donor, represents an additional hazard in
organ transplantation. The circumstances suggest that rabies virus
may have passed from the infected artery tissue to the brain of the
organ recipient by a non-neural route. In the case of transmission of
rabies virus via corneal transplantation, success has been achieved
in detecting virus in implants and initiating PEP within 24 hours of
transplantation. However, this is an exceptional case, and, unlikely
to be applicable generally. - Mod.CP]
