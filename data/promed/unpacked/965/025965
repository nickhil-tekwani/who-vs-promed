A Recombinant Bunyavirus Associated with Hemorrhagic Fever in East Africa
---------------------------------------------------
2 independent isolates of a virus classified in the genus _Orthobunyavirus_
(of the family _Bunyaviridae_) were obtained from hemorrhagic fever cases
during a large disease outbreak in East Africa in 1997 and 1998. Sequence
analysis of regions of the 3 genomic RNA segments of the virus
(provisionally referred to as Garissa virus): [see ProMED-mail post
"Garissa virus - Kenya, Somalia 20020109.3211" - Mod.CP] suggested that it
was a genetic reassortant virus with S and L segments derived from
Bunyamwera virus but an M segment from an unidentified virus of the genus
_Orthobunyavirus_. Whereas high genetic diversity (52 percent) was revealed
by analysis of virus M segment nucleotide sequences obtained from 21
members of the genus _Orthobunyavirus_, the Garissa and Ngari virus M
segments were almost identical. Surprisingly, the Ngari virus L and S
segments showed high sequence identity with those of Bunyamwera virus,
showing that Garissa virus is an isolate of Ngari virus, which in turn is a
Bunyamwera virus reassortant. Ngari virus should be considered when
investigating hemorrhagic fever outbreaks throughout sub-Saharan Africa.

[The above text is the abstract of a paper by Sonja R. Gerrard, Li Li, Alan
D. Barrett, and Stuart T. Nichol, entitled: "Ngari Virus Is a Bunyamwera
Virus Reassortant That Can Be Associated with Large Outbreaks of
Hemorrhagic Fever in Africa", published in the current issue of the Journal
of Virology.

It illustrates clearly that any segmented genome virus (the family
_Bunyaviridae_ comprises negative strand RNA viruses with tripartite RNA
virus genomes) has the potential to generate a novel disease-producing
virus by reassortment of genome sub-units from viruses not recognized to be
serious human pathogens. - Mod.CP]
