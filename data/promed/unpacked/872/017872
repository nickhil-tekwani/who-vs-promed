In the view of confirmation of the incidence of glanders disease, which primarily affects horses, in the districts of Yamunanagar and Sonipat, the Haryana government has issued advice highlighting the precautionary and zoo-sanitary measures to be undertaken to prevent its spread to other parts of the state.

An official of the animal husbandry and dairying department said 2 cases of the disease had been confirmed in Yamunanagar and 3 in Sonipat. The disease is highly contagious and usually fatal, caused by the _Burkholderia mallei_ bacteria. [A detailed description of glanders is included in the commentary].

He said that in order to minimize the spread of the disease, the owner should isolate the animal exhibiting such symptoms from other healthy animals.

[The following summary on glanders, an OIE-listed zoonotic disease of equidae, is derived from chapter 2.5.11 of OIE's terrestrial manual, updated in 2015:

"Glanders is a contagious and fatal disease of horses, donkeys, and mules, caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia mallei_. The pathogen causes nodules and ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form also occurs, known as "farcy". Control of glanders requires testing of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and elimination of reactors. As _B. mallei_ can be transmitted to humans, all infected or contaminated (or potentially infected or contaminated) material must be handled in a laboratory with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity controls following a biorisk analysis.

"Identification of the agent:
Smears from fresh material may reveal Gram negative, nonsporulating, nonencapsulated rods. The presence of a capsule-like cover has been demonstrated by electron microscopy. The bacteria grow aerobically and prefer media that contain glycerol. Unlike _Pseudomonas_ species and the closely related bacterium _B. pseudomallei_, _B. mallei_ is nonmotile. Commercially available biochemical identification kits lack diagnostic sensitivity. Specific monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as well as real-time PCR assays are available.

"Serological tests:
Complement fixation test is an accurate and reliable serological method for diagnostic use. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays show promise once their validation is complete. A rose bengal plate agglutination test has been developed. The immunoblot test based on a crude formalin preparation of _B. mallei_ antigens from isolates of different geographical regions is also a sensitive and specific assay. Mallein test: The mallein test is a hypersensitivity test against _B. mallei_. The test is not generally recommended because of animal welfare concerns, however it can be useful in remote endemic areas where sample transport or proper cooling of samples is not possible. Mallein, a water soluble protein fraction of the organism, is injected intradermo-palpebrally. In infected animals, the eyelid swells markedly within 1-2 days.

"Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals:
There are no vaccines. Mallein purified protein derivative is currently available commercially."

According to India's annual reports to the OIE, 2010-2014, the annual number of recorded glanders outbreaks (in equidae) countrywide was as follows: 2010 -- 1, 2011 -- 3, 2012 -- 1, 2013 -- 1, 2014 -- 0 (annual 2015 report for animals not yet available). No statistics on the incidence of glanders in humans in India could be obtained. - Mod.AS
