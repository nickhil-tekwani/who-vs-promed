Minnesota is in the midst of the largest outbreak of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis [MDR TB] in the country. Tuberculosis is a common disease across the world and is treatable in most cases. However, the multi-drug resistant strain needs to be treated with much harsher and more expensive medication. It also takes 3 times as long to treat. It costs USD17 000 to treat a normal case of tuberculosis and USD134 000 to treat the multi-drug resistant version, according to Kris Ehresmann, director of infectious disease epidemiology, prevention and control for the Minnesota Department of Health.

"We have 160 cases of tuberculosis every year in Minnesota that we're following up on, but we tend not to see much multi-drug resistant disease, thankfully," Ehresmann said. "Our average is zero to one (cases) a year... in 2016, we had 9 cases of multi-drug resistant disease that we identified. That obviously got our attention. Now in 2017 we've added to that 8 more cases so we have 17 total cases of multi-drug resistant disease." As of right now, the majority of the cases are in Hmong senior citizens.

"It's not a concern for college students in terms of acquiring disease, but yes, it has the potential to be a problem for more than just the elder population and that's why we're following it so closely," Ehresmann said.

In the past 2 years, Ramsey County [within the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area in the U.S. state of Minnesota] has had 17 cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, a drastic increase from the one-or-fewer average in other years. Up to 6 of the 17 have died, with 3 of those deaths being directly attributed to tuberculosis, said Kris Ehresmann, director for Infectious Disease at the Minnesota Department of Health, on [Mon 6 Nov 2017]. Of the 17 cases, 14 were in the Hmong community and 10 are associated with individuals who participate in activities at a senior center, Ehresmann said. Though it's the largest outbreak in the country, Ehresmann said it does not pose a concern to the general public.

"It's important for folks in the Hmong community to know that if you have older family members who have symptoms, cough, weight loss, night sweats, and other symptoms that are compatible with TB, you should be aware that this is something to be considered," Ehresmann said. "But definitely the general public needs to know it's not a concern. I would hate for anybody to think 'I'm not going to talk to my Hmong colleague or my Hmong friend' because of this." Tuberculosis is not easily transmitted and requires close, prolonged contact with an infected person to be transmitted, Director of St. Paul-Ramsey County Public Health Anne Barry said [Mon 6 Nov 2017].

The number of pansensitive tuberculosis cases has not changed recently. Most of the cases have been in Ramsey County, but other east-metro counties have seen the disease as well, Ehresmann said.

The department estimated the cause of the outbreak dates back to the Vietnam War. After helping the United States in the war, Hmong refugees fled 1st to Thailand and then gradually to the United States. Many of them came from the WatThamKrabok camp, Ehresmann said, which exposed many of its refugees to both multi-drug resistant and pansensitive tuberculosis. More than 3000 refugees ultimately resettled in Minnesota, bringing possible exposure with them.

Authorities don't know how many of these latent tuberculosis [a non-contagious form of tuberculous] infections are multi-drug resistant and how many are pansensitive , Ehresmann said, and there's no way to test it. About 10 percent of latent tuberculosis infections reactivate when the carrier gets older and more vulnerable. Minnesota officials are now discussing it because of the Ramsey County outbreak, but multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is an issue worldwide, Ehresmann said. About 25 percent of the population worldwide is estimated to have latent tuberculosis.

The state has identified more than 500 people to monitor for possible exposure, most of whom also participate in senior activities. The Department of Health is working with the Hmong community to raise awareness, Ehresmann said.

The Department of Health also requested USD224 635 from the state's new public health response fund to limit the disease's spread. Ramsey County health officials are heading the Health Department's efforts, working directly with clients, Barry said. "In our partnership with the Minnesota Department of Health, we're really the front line," Barry said. "We're working directly with the community and with people of the community in the health department, so we have health educations, community health workers, nurses who are in and of the Hmong community, and that's an essential part of the work that's being done here. We're often not trusted by people of the community, so having relationships has been essential."

[Ramsey County is included in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metropolitan Statistical Area. With a population of 540 649 residents, Ramsey County is one of the most densely populated counties in the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_County,_Minnesota). The city of St. Paul is the county seat of Ramsey County.

The Hmong are an indigenous people in Vietnam who resettled in Western countries after the Vietnam war, starting in the 1970's. The United States is home to the largest Hmong population (260 073), centered in Wisconsin (49 240), Minnesota (66 181) and California (91 224) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people). The largest Hmong-American community is in St. Paul, Minnesota (29 662), followed by Fresno, California (24 328), Sacramento, California (16 676), Milwaukee, Wisconsin (10 245), and Minneapolis, Minnesota (7512).

In 2016, a total of 9287 tuberculosis (TB) cases were reported in the United States; 10 states [Alaska (7.7), Hawaii (8.3), California (5.3), Texas (4.5), New York (3.9), Maryland (3.7), New York (3.9), New Jersey (3.3), Florida (3.1), Minnesota (3.0), and Arkansas (3.0), and the District of Columbia (3.7) reported incidence rates above the national average (2.9 cases per 100 000 persons). In 2016, 67.9 percent of reported TB cases in the U.S. occurred among non-U.S.-born persons; their incidence rate (14.6 cases per 100 000 persons) was approximately 14 times higher than among U.S.-born persons (1.1 cases per 100 000 persons) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6611a2.htm). Among foreign-born persons, the highest TB incidence in 2016 was among Asians (26.9 cases per 100 000) (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6611a2.htm).

In 2016, 96 TB cases were multidrug resistant (1.4 percent of cases with drug susceptibility results), i.e., were resistant to both isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF) (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/tbtrends.htm). Multidrug-resistant TB accounted for 0.4 percent and 1.2 percent of culture-confirmed TB cases among U.S.-born and foreign-born persons, respectively (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6611a2.htm). The CDC estimated that about 14 percent of U.S. TB cases with genotype data are attributed to recent transmission; the rest were due to reactivation of untreated latent disease (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/statistics/tbtrends.htm). The news reports above do not tell us how many of the cases in Ramsey County outbreak were thought to be reactivation of untreated latent TB and how many were thought to be recent acquisitions. Genotyping isolates would help in this regard.

Eradication of TB depends in part on treatment of latent TB, a non-contagious form of TB with negative cultures, to prevent its reactivation to pulmonary TB disease, the contagious form of the disease with positive cultures; but, as pointed out in the 2nd news report above, it is difficult to establish an effective treatment regimen for latent TB, if it is possibly due to multidrug resistant organisms. Latent TB is only recognized by reactivity to tuberculin; TB cultures are characteristically negative in latent TB. Without the availability of an organism, drug susceptibility testing is not possible. If a person is suspected to have latent TB due to a multidrug-resistant organism, the CDC suggests consultation with an expert in the treatment of multidrug resistant TB (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/ltbi/treatment.htm). - Mod.ML
