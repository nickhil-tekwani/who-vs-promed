Alarm as nurse and dog are treated for bovine TB
------------------------------------------------
A veterinary nurse and her dog have contracted bovine TB [tuberculosis],
raising fears that the high level of disease in some parts of the country
could spread to more humans and pets. The woman, from Cornwall, has been
treated for the respiratory infection. Her daughter has also been tested
for the disease and has received medication, The Times has learnt.

The incident was made public only after the Department for Environment Food
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed that it had started an investigation
into how the disease had crossed species. Information setting out the most
likely scenario of whether the nurse was infected by the dog, or
vice-versa, is expected to be published soon. The woman's identity was not
disclosed, but it is believed that she was involved in testing cattle for
bovine TB.

It is extremely rare for people to contract the [bovine TB] disease, but
there is a greater risk for farmers and vets who work closely with infected
animals. The incident has alarmed vets and farmers, amid growing concerns
over a decision by Hilary Benn, the Rural Affairs secretary, to refuse a
trial cull of infected badgers.

Badgers are being blamed for the spread of bovine tuberculosis through beef
and dairy herds. Last year [2007] there were 4137 outbreaks, a record in
modern times, and 28 175 cattle were slaughtered as a result. Farmers claim
that badgers spread TB by urinating on the fields grazed by cattle.
Conservationists, though, believe that the disease is spread between cattle
themselves and exploded only after 2001, when farmers restocked their herds
after the foot-and-mouth crisis.

Experts are waiting to see how the disease was transmitted to the nurse and
her pet and whether new wildlife controls to curb its spread are necessary.
The Health Protection Agency played down fears of an increased threat to
humans and said that the current risk in Britain was considered negligible.

Despite this, Roger Sainsbury, a former government veterinary officer in
Cornwall, who specialised in bovine TB for 30 years, said "My real concern
is that the number of cases in humans could increase because of the high
incidence of TB in the environment." He said that the threat was not
confined to rural areas and was emerging closer to larger human
populations. "You could get contamination anywhere these days, even in a
children's sandpit, and disease can be transmitted through a cut," he said.
"This disease is not just confined to the South West, but in hotspots
throughout the country." Disease can be passed from a cat or dog to humans
through open wounds or abscesses, coughs, and sneezes. Any person can
spread the disease through an open cut or if the disease is in the lung it
can be spread by breathing over an animal. Mr Sainsbury said: "This is a
very serious problem. We could do something about it but we are not and
that is a travesty."

Nicky Paul, a veterinary surgeon in Lostwithiel, Cornwall, who becomes the
president of the British Veterinary Association this month [September
2008], said that she was aware of the case and was waiting for the
epidemiological study to be published. She said: "My biggest concern would
be if the report showed the nurse had picked up the disease direct from
handling a badger."

DEFRA said that experts were awaiting the conclusions of the investigation.
"Bovine TB is a recognised zoonotic agent and that is precisely why we have
a compulsory bovine TB control programme in cattle." According to the
Health Protection Agency, in 2006, the latest year for which data is
available, there were 33 cases of bovine TB in humans reported in Britain,
of which 6 were in the South West. The agency confirms there were 2 cases
in the South West in 2007.

However, in pets incidence of bovine TB is showing a small increase
[details will be welcomed. - Mod.AS] and it is recommended that any
infected cat or dog be put down. [As may appear from the headline of the
Times article, the dog involved in the current case is being "treated";
confirmation or otherwise, and -- in case confirmed -- a clarification,
including details of the treatment applied, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
Defra said that the disease had been found in 2 dogs and 11 cats so far
this year [2008]. Locations have not been disclosed.

The cost of control (source: DEFRA, Times Database)
---------------------------------------------------
- in 2007 there were 2215 confirmed cases of TB in Britain;
- current government policy is for animals that test positive for TB to be
slaughtered with farmers compensated for the loss;
- in 2007, 7905 cattle were slaughtered to control the disease in Wales. In
1997 it was 669.
- Compensation costs were BP 15.2 million [USD 27.36 million] last year
[2007]. The bill in 2000-01 was BP 1.8 million [USD 3.24 million];
- among worst affected areas have been Pembrokeshire and Monmouthshire
[Wales];
- in 2007 the Welsh Assembly had to overcome a legal challenge to slaughter
Shambo, a Hindu temple bullock. Police were called to remove Hindu
worshippers so that animal health officials could take Shambo from the
Skanda Vale religious community in Carmarthenshire.

The following information on UK bovine TB control in bovines has been
copied/edited from the booklet "Dealing with Bovine TB in your herd,"
issued cooperatively by DEFRA, the Scottish Government, and the Wales
Authority Government (updated May 2008).

How is bovine tuberculosis (bTB) detected in live cattle?
---------------------------------------------------------
The cornerstone of TB control in cattle is the accurate detection and
removal of animals infected with _M. bovis_ before they become infectious
to other animals. Importantly, infected cattle can become infectious long
before they exhibit any obvious clinical signs or lesions typical of TB
detectable even with the most careful veterinary examination. Even if
present, the clinical signs of TB in cattle are seldom typical. As a
result, effective ante mortem diagnosis of bovine TB must rely on detecting
infection with _M. bovis_ rather than disease.

The 2 types of tests currently approved in the European Union for the
diagnosis of TB in live cattle are based on this principle. The intradermal
tuberculin (skin) tests are the primary screening tests, whilst the
gamma-interferon assay is only approved as an ancillary diagnostic tool.

What is a reactor?
------------------
A reactor is an animal that has failed a) the comparative intradermal
tuberculin skin test (the variant of the tuberculin test used in the
British Isles) or b) any other relevant test, including the
gamma-interferon blood test. In other words, these cattle give a test
result consistent with their being affected with bTB.

In respect of a), this means that the animal has had an allergic reaction
to the injection of a defined amount of _M. bovis_ protein (called
tuberculin) into the skin of the neck. This shows as a swelling ("lump") on
the side of the neck approximately 72 hours after the injection. The size
of this swelling is compared with that of the swelling (if any) resulting
from the injection of tuberculin from _Mycobacterium avium_ side-by-side
(hence the term 'comparative' test). _M. avium_ is a bacterium related to
_M. bovis_. It is also present in the cattle population and, although it
does not cause TB in cattle, it can sensitise cattle against _M. bovis_
tuberculin and give rise to a false positive result. If the swelling caused
by the _M. bovis_ tuberculin is larger than the swelling caused by the _M.
avium_ tuberculin by a defined amount, the test result is positive and the
animal is deemed a reactor. When one or more reactors are found in a herd,
this is known as a TB 'incident' or a herd 'breakdown'. Animal Health will
aim to remove your reactor animals as quickly as possible to help control
the disease and help your herd regain its TB free status.

Do all reactors have bTB?
-------------------------
The tuberculin test is used throughout the world to screen cattle and other
animals for TB. This test detects an infected animal's immune response
against _M. bovis_ (the bacterium that causes TB), which develops well
before the infected animal begins to show signs of TB. The tuberculin test
is the internationally accepted standard for detection of infection with
_M. bovis_ and is considered the best test currently available for
detecting TB in live animals. Many countries have eradicated bTB through
the systematic application of the tuberculin test alone and the slaughter
of all test reactors.

No screening test for animal diseases is perfect and the tuberculin test is
no exception. On one hand, the comparative tuberculin test can be expected
to detect approximately 80 per cent of all the infected cattle in a herd at
any one test. This is known as the test's sensitivity. On the other hand,
reactions to the tuberculin test can sometimes be caused by exposure to
other mycobacteria. In Great Britain, when the test is applied to cattle
without TB there is a 1 in 1000 chance that a non-infected animal will be
wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test's false positive
rate. Because it is impossible to find out in living animals whether the
reaction to the test is due to _M. bovis_ or another mycobacterium, all
reactors have to be regarded as infected and must be slaughtered according
to national and European Union regulations in order to eliminate any risk
of infection to other cattle.

The probability that an individual reactor is truly infected with _M.
bovis_ and thus likely to have TB (or develop the disease in the near
future) is known as the positive predictive value. The key thing to
remember here is that this value is not a constant property of the test
because it depends not only on its sensitivity and false positive rate, but
also on the proportion of truly infected animals in the herd at the time
the reactor is found (which is seldom known). A test with good sensitivity
and extremely low false positive rate, such as the tuberculin test, can
still have a low predictive value if the proportion of infected cattle in
the herd being screened is very low. This is an unavoidable problem for any
test as eradication of a disease from a herd (or a whole region) is
approached. The ease with which lesions of TB can be detected at slaughter
is also an issue and this in turn depends upon the stage of infection, with
lesions being harder to find in the early stages of TB (that is, when most
animals are detected).

What happens when a reactor is found?
-------------------------------------
Your herd will be placed under movement restrictions and we will value and
slaughter the reactors. In some cases we may also remove non-reactor
('direct contact') animals. The rest of your herd will have to undergo a
series of tuberculin tests until we are satisfied that the herd is free
from bTB and restrictions can be lifted. In prescribed circumstances the
tuberculin test may be supplemented with the gamma interferon test.

What happens to reactor animals?
--------------------------------
You must isolate them immediately from the rest of the herd until they are
slaughtered. This will reduce the risk of them spreading TB in your herd.
Unless you decide to arrange a private slaughter the animals will be valued
and taken directly to slaughter (we will pay you compensation for all
reactors and any other animals slaughtered to control bTB.). We will
usually examine their carcases to find out how advanced the infection was.
Where necessary, we will also take tissue samples. We will send these to
one of our TB diagnostic laboratories, where they will try to isolate _M.
bovis_ from the tissue samples. _M. bovis_ is one of the slowest growing
bacteria and is not very easy to grow in the laboratory. Even if enough
viable bacteria are present in the tissues of a reactor, it is likely to be
at least 6 weeks from the date we send off the samples before we have any
results.

Why complete a postmortem examination?
--------------------------------------
By examining the carcase we may be able to quickly confirm whether your
animal had bTB and, if so, whether it was in the early or advanced stages
of the disease. If we confirm bTB in one or more of your reactors, we will
review the tuberculin test results again, lowering the cut-off point for an
animal to be declared a reactor. (This is known as 'severe interpretation')
and may result in further animals being classed as reactors. The postmortem
findings also help us decide how much more testing is needed in your herd
and in neighbouring herds, and whether we should trace any animals you may
have bought or sold before the TB restrictions came into force.

Laboratory tests on tissue samples from reactor cattle to see if _M. bovis_
can be cultured (grown in the laboratory) are carried out for 2 reasons. On
the one hand, we may fail to find the typical lesions of TB at postmortem
examination of reactors. These lesions are visible signs of TB in the
carcase of an infected animal, usually taking the form of many small
abscesses in the lymph nodes of the head and chest, the lungs, and/or other
affected organs. In the absence of visible lesions, culturing marginally
increases the likelihood of confirming if the animal had bTB. On the other
hand, if bTB has already been confirmed by the presence of lesions at
postmortem, the culture is done anyway to identify the strain of _M. bovis_
that caused your outbreak. This may help us identify the source of
infection to your herd.

We will provide you and your veterinary surgeon with a written report on
the results of the postmortem examination. Similarly, if we send samples
for culture, we will write to you as soon as we know the results.

If your tuberculin test revealed several reactors, we may not collect
samples from every animal we slaughter, although all will have a postmortem
examination.

What happens if you don't find detectable evidence of bTB in the reactors?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Culture of _M. bovis_ in the laboratory provides the definitive proof of
infection. Disclosure of typical TB lesions does not, in itself, prove
infection because such lesions can on rare occasions be caused by other
mycobacteria. However, for practical purposes the presence of TB lesions in
a reactor is considered sufficient to confirm infection with _M. bovis_.
Laboratory culture and postmortem examination are very specific methods for
the diagnosis of cattle infected with _M. bovis_. However, these 2
techniques are far less sensitive than the tuberculin test and they cannot
be considered the "gold standards" when trying to establish the true
infection status of a reactor.

We can only look in detail at a relatively small part of the carcase. We
know where we are most likely to find evidence of bTB, so we concentrate on
those areas. It could also mean that the parts we examined were uninfected,
or that the changes were too small to be seen with the naked eye even
though the animal was infected. If we don't find bTB at the postmortem
examination or in the laboratory, we will class the animal as an
'unconfirmed reactor'. We will still carry out more herd tests to make sure
there is no infection left on your farm. Please remember that because a
postmortem examination is not a perfect technique for identifying bTB,
failure to find TB lesions or to culture _M. bovis_ from samples does not
mean the animal did not have bTB.

What should I do with the milk from reactor cows until they are removed?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Milk from individual reactors to the tuberculin or other diagnostic tests
(that is, including severe interpretation reactors, 3 times inconclusive
reactors and gamma interferon test reactors) must not be used for human
consumption, whether heat-treated or not. Milk from these animals must be
withheld from the bulk tank and may be disposed of either by mixing it with
slurry and spreading it on land or other appropriate manner. However, under
the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006, which came in
force on 15 May 2006, anyone wishing to dispose of reactor milk by mixing
it with slurry and spreading it on agricultural land, must first register
for a waste management licence exemption under 'Exemption 47' (N.B. no
charge is made for this exemption). To register for such an exemption you
will need to contact the Environment Agency. If you carry out this waste
activity and do not register it as an exemption, you will need to have a
full waste management licence, which is chargeable. This ban only applies
to milk from reactors, that is, milk from other 'clear test' and
inconclusive animals in a reactor herd can continue to be sold if
pasteurisation is undertaken. If you are unsure which these animals are
please contact your local AHDO [Animal Health Divisional Office].

Milk from a herd that has lost Officially TB-Free status must be heat
treated (pasteurised) before being sold for human consumption and the herd
owner or person in charge should contact their milk buyer to ensure that
this is the case.

Also, we strongly advise against feeding reactor cow's milk to calves or
livestock, or indeed to any other species, for example, pets and pigs,
particularly when a reactor has suffered from long-lasting mastitis that is
hard to treat, that is, this may, on occasion, be caused by TB of the udder.

non-vet subscribers, is available at

The results of the investigation into the current case, exploring the route
of human infection directly from a bovine or a badger, or rather via the
intermediary infection in the dog, are expected with interest. - Mod.AS

_M. bovis_ (MB) is a member of the '_M. tuberculosis complex_' (MTC), which
includes _M. tuberculosis_, MB, MB BCG, _M. africanum_, _M. microti_ (vole
bacillus), _M. caprae_, and _M. canettii_. Rapid identification of MTC in
clinical specimens by use a broth-based culture system combined with
amplification assays that identify ribosomal RNA common to all members of
MTC has commonly replaced in many laboratories the more time-consuming
tests of colonial and phenotypic differential characteristics since the
early 1990s. If further diagnostic testing is not done, MB may erroneously
be presumed to be _M. tuberculosis_.

MB is the major cause of tuberculosis in bovine species and can also infect
many other animal species --for example, goats, sheep, horses, pigs, cats,
and dogs. MB is spread from cow-to-cow by inhalation of the organism in
aerosolized droplets. The pathology in cows is similar to that of M.
tuberculosis in humans, with pulmonary tuberculosis leading to chronic
debilitation and coughing, and potential hematogenous spread to other
organs. One to 2 per cent of MB-infected cows develop mycobacterial
mastitis with shedding of the organism in milk.

MB can be transmitted to humans by either ingestion of unpasteurized milk
or milk products, or inhalation of infectious aerosols from infected
animals. People with pulmonary infection can shed the organism from their
airways back to cattle. Although rare, person-to-person transmission of MB
does nevertheless occur. Following ingestion, MB most commonly localizes in
cervical lymph nodes (scrofula) or the gastrointestinal tract and related
lymph nodes. These forms of the infection occur commonly in children and
were common in people during the pre-pasteurization era. Classic upper lobe
pulmonary tuberculosis follows reactivation of latent MB infection and
occurs in as many as 50 per cent of adults in the United States who were
either born or traveled in other countries with endemic bovine tuberculosis
or were born in the United States when bovine tuberculosis was endemic.
Extrapulmonary disease is also prominent in adults, especially those with
underlying immunosuppressive disorders such as HIV infection, in whom the
disease can be rapidly fatal.

The current risk posed by MB to human health in most developed countries is
considered negligible because of the success of bovine tuberculosis
eradication programs that began early in the last century. This program
involved mandatory pasteurization of urban milk supplies, meat inspection
in slaughterhouses, and compulsory tuberculin test-and-slaughter programs.
Nevertheless, bovine tuberculosis is still periodically reported in the
Unites States and in other developed countries as the above report
illustrates (see ProMED-mail: Tuberculosis, bovine - USA (05): (CA)
20080710.2100; Tuberculosis, bovine - USA (OK) 20070501.1420; and
Tuberculosis, bovine - USA (04): (MN) status downgrade 20080408.1296).

Human MB tuberculosis still occurs in many developing countries, where
bovine tuberculosis remains endemic, and may be under-appreciated in much
of the Unites States because of the limited use of complex and expensive
diagnostic laboratory testing. The same is also likely true in much of the
developing world, where bacteriologic diagnostic testing is generally
limited to acid-fast stained sputum smear examination. -Mod.ML
