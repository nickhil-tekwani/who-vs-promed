[The 9 Oct 1999 issue (Volume 354, No. 9186) of the Lancet contains two
original papers on the Nipah virus encephalitis outbreaks in Malaysia and
Singapore, respectively. Excerpts from the commentary by Jeremy J Farrar

Nipah-virus encephalitis -- investigation of a new infection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1997 an outbreak of an encephalitic illness among pig-farm workers was
reported from the Kinta District in the state of Perak in Malaysia; one
patient died. The region is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus
infections and, despite some uncharacteristic clinical features, the cases
were assumed to have been caused by this virus.
In September, 1998, again in Perak, the numbers of adults presenting with a
high fever and an encephalopathic illness rose sharply. All these patients
either were pig-farmers or were directly associated with the pig industry.
By March, 1999, as Nicholas Paton and colleagues report in today's Lancet,
similar cases were being seen in Singapore among abattoir workers processing
pigs imported from Malaysia.
In May, 1999, the Malaysian Ministry of Health, in association with the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, reported a total
of 258 cases of encephalitis in adults, with a case- fatality rate of almost
40%. The cause turned out to be a hitherto unknown virus, named Nipah virus
because it was first isolated from a fatal case of encephalitis from the
town of Nipah in the state of Perak. The causative agent was not Japanese
encephalitis virus, and there is no unequivocal evidence that the epidemic
was due to a mixed infection of these two viruses.
Although the number of new cases of Nipah-virus encephalitis in Malaysia has
declined substantially from the peak in early 1999, new cases, with
fatalities, were still being reported in June, 1999. It is possible, given
the long latency of infection seen in the outbreak of the related Hendra
virus in Australia, that further cases will present in the future despite
apparent control of the epidemic [by slaughtering of most pigs in the
region. [One Australian human case of Hendra virus infection appeared to
have had an incubation period of a year - Mod.JW
It is now clear that the epidemiological features of Nipah-virus
encephalitis are distinct from those of Japanese encephalitis. All the
deaths were in adults who had been in direct contact with pigs, and many of
the patients reported illness in their pigs in the preceding weeks. In
endemic regions Japanese encephalitis virus affects mostly children, adults
are presumably immune, and, although the pig is an amplifying host, the
animals do not generally become ill. Furthermore, many of the patients in
the Nipah-virus outbreak had been vaccinated against Japanese encephalitis.
Family members of the affected individuals were not ill, and people living
in the same area, but who were not directly involved in pig- farming, did
not develop the illness. These features suggest that person-to-person
transmission was unusual and that mosquitoes or other insect vectors did not
spread the virus.
The ProMED project (http://www.fas.org/promed ), established to monitor
global emerging diseases, has been an invaluable source of information
throughout this epidemic. During the early course of the epidemic, several
press reports were confusing, as were statements by the Malaysian Ministry
of Health, about the aetiological agent and the spread of infection. Much of
the problem stemmed from the loose definitions of "a case", confusion over
the interpretation of serological data, and the dogmatic assumption made
early on that the epidemic was due to Japanese encephalitis.
Unequivocal confirmation of disease demands either isolation of the virus or
a rising titre of specific antibody from serum taken during acute and
convalescent phases. For confirmation that a virus is the cause of
encephalitis, the virus should be isolated or demonstrated by amplification
of viral nucleic acid by a specific PCR from the brain or,
less convincingly, from the cerebrospinal fluid. Alternatively, there should
be specific IgM antibody in the cerebrospinal fluid with no evidence of
contaminating blood or serum leak into that compartment. Use of such
diagnostic gold standards is essential in the description of a new clinical
syndrome for which nothing is known about the natural history or the
dynamics of the antibody response to the infectious agent.
Over-interpretation of the serological evidence and an assumption that
Japanese encephalitis was the cause of the epidemic may have led to the
implementation of inappropriate or even damaging interventions (ie, the mass
vaccination of pigs against Japanese encephalitis infection, with reuse of
needles) and a delay in the
implementation of rational control measures.
