Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] is showing signs of making a comeback in
Viet Nam with the northern province of Quang Tri reporting an
outbreak Wednesday [4 Jul 2007].
Almost 600 cows, buffalos, goats, and pigs contracted the viral
disease last month [June 2007], mostly in Dakrong, Gio Linh, Trieu
Phong, Cam Lo, and Huong Hoa districts. Local authorities are
tightening measures to contain it, and have quarantined the diseased
animals.
Just last month [June 2007], the central Veterinary Department
announced that foot-and-mouth disease was in retreat after no
incidence of the disease had been reported anywhere in the country
for 21 days.
Foot-and-mouth is a highly contagious disease that affects animals
with divided hooves; the animal develops ulcers in the mouth and near
the hooves.

[Reports on Viet Nam's FMD situation can be derived from 2
international databases. Serotype O seems to be endemic, as apparent
from the information collected by the Regional Coordination Unit
(RCU), responsible for coordinating the control of FMD in Southeast
Asia. The RCU delivers programs as agreed by the OIE (World
Organisation for Animal Health) Sub-Commission for FMD control in
Southeast Asia, commonly titled SEAFMD-OIE. Cooperating countries
include Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam.
According to the monthly data for 2006-7, presented in table and map
forms in the SEAFMD-OIE website, outbreaks of FMDV serotype O were
recorded during all months of 2006, peaking in May, when most of the
country's provinces were affected throughout north and south Viet
Nam. The disease was again reported in February-March 2007. FMDV
Serotype A was reported during January-April 2006 in 4 provinces of
South Viet Nam, but not later (up to the last available monthly
report, March 2007).
On 24 May 2006, Viet Nam authorities submitted 2 official
notifications to OIE's WAHID (World Animal Health Information
Database). One notified widespread outbreaks of FMD caused by
serotype O, involving 330 communes and 114 districts, in 32
provinces. The reason given for the immediate notification was "a
sudden and unexpected increase in the incidence of a listed disease
prevalent within a country or zone/compartment".
The other notification related to the recording of FMD serotype Asia
1, in cattle, buffaloes, and pigs in Ha Giang province -- adjacent to
the Chinese border -- affecting 19 communes in 6 districts.
Reportedly, the diagnosis was carried out by PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) at the Pirbright (UK) Laboratory (OIE's Reference
Laboratory). The reason given for this immediate notification was
"first occurrence of a new strain of a pathogen associated with a
listed disease in a country". There are no later official reports on
the FMD situation in Viet Nam available on the WAHID website.
The Viet Nam reports in the SEAFMD-OIE website do not mention the
Asia-1 outbreak; see
<http://www.seafmd-rcu.oie.int/fmd_se_asia.php?reptype=map&state=VNM&month=03&year=2007>.
On the other hand, the incidence of FMDV serotype A could not be
found in the report to WAHID. Could this be due to its possible
status as endemic?!
A new update from Viet Nam to the OIE will help to maintain
uniformity and clarity in the information on the FMD situation in the
country.
