The specimen arrived and we had a look at it. It is not head smut
(_Sphacelotheca_) but appears to be corn [boil] smut, _Ustilago
maydis_.

In the big field just above my house, which had been cut for cattle
silage, I came across a [maize] cob on the ground with the full
infection of what the Mexicans call 'huitlacoche.' They tin it for
human consumption. This is yet another manifestation of the species
_U. maydis_ (phylum _Basidiomycota_, class _Ustilaginomycetes_, order
_Ustilaginales_, genus _Ustilago_). This is the 1st time I have
actually seen it on a maize cob here, apart from the seed I grew
imported from Peru (purple maize variety). We grow a lot of maize
here and it is difficult to see what is happening in the fields as
the plants are very close together.

The pictures that Susan sent, her comment that it was not visible in
the cob itself, and also the position of the smut gall on the stem
actually made me consider that maybe this is boil/common smut
(_Ustilago maydis_) and not head smut (_S. reiliana_) -- my reason
for saying that is that you always see head smut in the tassel first
and then without exception also in the cob .... or rather where there
is supposed to be a cob.... of that same plant.

Susan also states it does not occur on the cob. This symptom on the
other hand is somewhere halfway on the stem. Boil smut is more prone
to cause this random gall formation where some kind of damage
(insect/hail) occurred. But the gall itself I must say looks more
like a typical headsmut gall???

[Boil smut of maize is caused by _Ustilago maydis_, head smut is
caused by _Sphacelotheca reiliana_. Huitlacoche, also called 'Mexican
corn truffle', consists of the immature galls of _U. maydis_ and is
considered a delicacy.

There has been tremendous interest in the original item and it
appears that the maize smuts are of considerable concern in several
regions. Thank you to Cathie, Susan, and Rikus for their help in
clearing up the diagnosis as _U. maydis_, albeit with perhaps some
slightly unusual looking galls.

I would like to encourage all ProMED-plant readers to send in reports
on any plant diseases you may observe or hear about in your area,
even if the diagnosis is uncertain (please email to
<promed@promedmail.org>). These first hand reports are a valuable
source of information for us all and are very much appreciated.
