Report on the Investigation of the 19th Case of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) in Canada

1.1 Details of the BSE Case
----------------------------------
A sample taken from a cow in Alberta, Canada was identified as positive for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The case animal was reported by the owner to have been non-ambulatory (downer) in the days preceding its death. After consultation between the producer and the local veterinary practitioner, it was determined that the animal met the inclusion criteria of Canada's National BSE Surveillance Program. The animal was euthanized on 4 Feb 2015, and arrangements were made to collect and submit appropriate tissue samples for evaluation.

On 7 Feb 2015, the Alberta Agriculture Edmonton Laboratory (now Alberta Agriculture and Forestry TSE Laboratory) informed the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) of a BSE surveillance sample (collected through the Canada-Alberta BSE Surveillance Program) with an initial reaction on the BIO-RAD TeSeE ELISA rapid test that remained positive on repeat testing.

As per Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) ISO quality assurance (QA) guidelines, homogenates and samples were forwarded to the CFIA and OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) BSE Reference Laboratory in Lethbridge, Alberta. The sample was confirmed as BSE positive using the OIE Immunoblot (SAF and mAB 6H4) test on 11 Feb 2015. In addition to the OIE Immunoblot, the National BSE Reference Laboratory evaluated the sample using the Prionics-Check Western rapid test, Hybrid Western Blot, the Prionics Check PrioSTRIP rapid test, and the BioRad TeSeE ELISA. All test results were determined to be positive. Hybrid Western Blot results characterized the case as C-type (classical) BSE.

The carcass was secured at the sampling site, obtained by and transferred to CFIA's laboratory in Lethbridge for incineration. No part of the carcass entered the human food supply or animal feed chain.

The positive animal (Case 19) was confirmed to be a purebred Black Angus beef cow born on 25 Mar 2009, therefore, being 70 months of age at the time of death. It had been sold from its birth farm, via an auction mart, to the farm where it was sampled, just over a year prior to detection (22 Jan 2014). This was the 2nd BSE case born on the birth farm (the previous was case 17, born in March 2004).

The birth farm of the case animal was a cow-calf operation with both purebred Black Angus and commercial beef cattle. At the time of detection of this case, there were 290 breeding cows on the birth farm.

1.2 Case Investigation Overview
---------------------------
1.2.1 CFIA Investigation as Specified by the OIE

The CFIA immediately initiated an epidemiological investigation based on the recommended BSE guidelines (Terrestrial Animal Health Code 2014) of the OIE and the CFIA's BSE Manual of Procedures. Specifically, the CFIA followed the recommended BSE guidelines for a country with controlled risk status and investigated:

**Feed: all sources of feed to which the infected animal was or may have been exposed during its 1st year of life;
** Feed cohort: all cattle which, during their 1st year of life, were reared with the BSE case during its 1st year of life, and which investigation showed consumed the same potentially contaminated feed during that period; and/or
** Birth cohort: all other cattle that were born on the same farm and within 12 months of the infected animal's birth.

1.2.2 Identifying Potential Risk Pathways for Exposure to the BSE agent

BSE case 19 had 2 unique characteristics when compared with previous cases Canada has experienced to date:
** This was the 2nd BSE case to be born on the same birth farm (as was case 17, born in March 2004). Canada has not previously identified more than one BSE case born on the same farm.
** The affected animal was born after the enhanced feed ban (EFB): The EFB, implemented on 12 Jul 2007, ensures that specified risk material (SRM) is excluded from animal feed, pet food and fertilizers. Case 19 was born in March 2009, which is 20 months after the EFB was implemented.

To complete this investigation, on-farm and off-farm risks pathways potentially associated with the unique characteristics of this case were examined. The following sections provide an overview of Canada's feed ban and the potential risk pathways that were considered in the course of the investigation.

4. Investigation Summary
--------------------------
Case 19 was a case of classical BSE in a Black Angus beef cow, 5 years and 10 months of age at time of diagnosis. It was born in March 2009, 20 months after the enhanced feed ban was implemented. A previous case of BSE was diagnosed on the same birth farm from an animal born in 2004.

As for other cases of classical BSE in Canada and in other countries, feed-borne infection is the most likely source of BSE in this case. BSE case 19 was born shortly after the enhanced feed ban was implemented, which may suggest residual feed contamination on-farm or off-farm as the source of infection. No significant events could be linked with this case, but the potential for the carry-over of a small amount of residual contaminated feed could not be discounted. Considering the stringent safeguards implemented from 2007 to ensure that SRMs are excluded from the entire terrestrial and aquatic animal feed chains as well as fertilizer, together with the rigorous inspection oversight by the CFIA, the contamination of both prohibited and non-prohibited materials with SRM at either a slaughter establishment or a rendering facility would in all likelihood be highly improbable. As a result, the carry-over of a small amount of residual contaminated feed associated with the earlier case (17) on the same birth farm is the most plausible explanation for BSE case 19.

Trace-out of birth cohort animals is ongoing and expected to be completed for the end of 2015. Live cohorts traced are permanently identified, their movements controlled, and upon death or destruction are disposed of in accordance with OIE requirements and the CFIA's BSE Manual of Procedures.

5. Impact of Current Findings
------------------------------
The results of Canada's ongoing surveillance program continue to confirm that BSE remains under effective control. Since it is widely recognised that cattle are most susceptible to becoming infected in their 1st year of life, an analysis of surveillance test results stratified by the year of birth (a birth cohort analysis) provides a surrogate measure of exposure to the BSE-agent in the cattle population in any given year. Even though Canada has recently had a BSE case born almost 2 years after enhancements were made to the feed ban in 2007 to exclude SRM from the entire terrestrial and aquatic animal feed chains, the updated results from a birth cohort analysis incorporating this case confirm that the overall risk profile has not changed (Footnote 13). The impact of this case on the prevalence estimates for the 2009 and subsequent birth cohorts is inconsequential. They remain extremely low.

[As we have come to expect with our Canadian colleagues they did a very thorough investigation, and their report is well worth reading. Apart from anything else, it is straightforward and easy to follow. I wish other government agencies were as competent communicators. The point to be taken from this is that otherwise negligible traces of contaminated feed can pose a real threat.
