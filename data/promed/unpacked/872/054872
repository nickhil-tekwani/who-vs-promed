Re: Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (39): pediatric deaths 20090904.3118
------------------
I am wondering if I could highlight and express some opinion on the
data published on 36 pediatric deaths in the MMWR Weekly, Fri 4 Sep
2009 / 58(34);941-947 [reproduced in ProMED-mail post "Influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (39): pediatric deaths 20090904.3118"]. I am
doing this as many of us are uncomfortable with the decisions and
recommendations to give oseltamivir to all children under 5 years
with ILI [influenza-like illness].

The argument:
1. Data from MMWR on the 36 deaths: Only 8 out of 36 deaths were aged
5 years or below. If we compare co-morbids in those aged 5 years or
below and those above 5 years, 4/8 (50 percent) were in those aged 5
years or below, and 22/28 (78.6 percent) in those aged above 5 years.
Hence, these data do not support one of the conclusions that
"children aged less than 5 years or with certain chronic medical
conditions are at increased risk for complications and death from
H1N1;" certain chronic medical conditions yes, but not under 5 years of age.

2. The data suggest the limited value of treatment in well children
with ILI. See Neuraminidase inhibitors for treatment and prophylaxis
of influenza in children: Systematic review and meta-analysis of
randomised controlled trials. Matthew Shun-Shin, et al. BMJ 2009;339:b3172.

3. There is concern about toxicity of oseltamivir (See: Oseltamivir
adherence and side effects among children in three London schools
affected by influenza A(H1N1)v, May 2009, and in an internet-based
cross-sectional survey. A Kitching, et al. Eurosurveillance, Volume
14, Issue 30, 30 July 2009 and other studies in rats.

4. Finally, lots of children under 5 yrs will get an URTI (upper
respiratory tract infection) -- defined as ILI under current
circumstances -- so we will definitely be treating many children.

Comments would be appreciated.

[Separately, Dr. Amar-Singh has sent the following request. Again,
ProMED-mail suggests that readers able to respond should communicate
directly with Dr. Amar-Singh. - Mod.CP]:

I [would like to post the following problem] on ProMED-mail for
discussion: We are in the phase of the epidemic in which we are
seeing children come back with a 2nd ILI, and we are not sure how to
manage them.

Possible presentations of child with 2nd ILI, previously:
1. Child admitted with ILI treated with oseltamivir. PCR positive for H1N1
2. Child admitted with ILI treated with oseltamivir. PCR negative for H1N1
3. Child seen with ILI in OPD/A&E (Out patients/Accidents &
Emergency) treated with oseltamivir. No PCR but Rapid Kit Inf A positive.
4. Child seen with ILI in OPD/A&E not treated with oseltamivir. No
PCR but Rapid Kit Inf A negative.
5. Child seen with ILI in OPD/A&E treated with oseltamivir. No
PCR/Rapid kit test.
6. Child seen with ILI in OPD/A&E not treated with oseltamivir. No
PCR/Rapid kit test.

Possibilities interpretations:
1. Nosocomial infection (bacterial) from hospital stay
2. Another viral agent
3. Re-infected with same H1N1 strain (unlikely)
4. Infected with variant H1N1 strain

I know we will have to use clinical judgment, but it can be tough. We
have had children coming back with viral pneumonias (2nd episode
within 4 weeks).

If they were positive for H1N1 before, it is easier as there is no
need to give oseltamivir, but for the other, how many courses of
oseltamivir are we going to give?
