----------------------------------------------
About half the cattle at the nation's feed lots carry the deadly _E. coli_
O157:H7 bacteria during the summer -- making it at least 10 times more
common than previously thought, government research shows. The study by
Agriculture Department scientists doesn't mean that _E. coli_ O157:H7 is
any more likely to show up in the supermarket. But USDA (United States
Department of Agriculture) officials, who outlined the findings Tuesday,
said they are considering new controls on cattle production and beef
processing.
The research "requires us to re-examine our policies and standards for
dealing with this difficult organism," Thomas Billy, administrator of
USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, (FSIS) said at a conference in
Arlington, Virginia.
The bacteria, which is most commonly found in ground beef, kills about 60
people each year and sickens an estimated 73,000 more, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The department's findings, which will be published in April's Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), are based on detection methods
far more sensitive than previously used.
The occurrence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in feed lots drops to 1 percent during
the winter, but scientists found 83 percent of the cattle they studied had
been exposed to the bacteria at some point. Calves can pick up the bacteria
during the birth process, while other cattle get it from manure, scientists
say. Changes in feeding methods and transportation have been shown to
reduce the incidence of _E. coli_ O157:H7.
Consumer groups say the government needs to require far more extensive
testing of cattle and beef to prevent people from being exposed to the
germs. Testing is now required only on ground beef, a program that started
after tainted hamburger killed several children in Washington state in 1993.
"Like throwing darts at a dart board, although the government hits the
target occasionally, it is clearly missing a lot of the problem," said
Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
The incidence of _E. coli_ O157:H7 in cattle is believed to vary by region
as well as time of the year. An industry-funded study released Tuesday
found a wide variation of infection rates at packing plants. At least 18
percent of the cattle headed for slaughter at a dozen plants were carrying
the bacteria. Two of the plants had no infected cattle, and the average
rate for the 12 facilities was 3.56 percent. The bacteria was found on 0.44
percent of the fresh carcasses sampled in the study. But no _E. coli_
O157:H7 showed up once the carcasses had gone through the plants' usual
cleaning process, which generally involves steam, hot water or organic acid
rinses.
The study shows that E. coli O157:H7 testing should be done earlier in the
packing process, so infected meat is caught before it is processed,
industry officials said.
"It is our hope that this data will encourage USDA to re-evaluate its
ground-beef sampling program," said James H. Hodges, president of the
American Meat Industry Foundation, which sponsored the research. "A carcass
testing program for _E. coli_ O157:H7 is more practicable and will help
ensure that the safest and most wholesome product possible enters commerce."
Scientists are working on additional methods of treating meat to kill a
variety of pathogens, -including _E. coli_ O157:H7. One is an
anti-microbial agent, known as lactoferrin, that is a naturally occurring
protein in the milk of mammals, including humans. Laboratory research
presented at Tuesday's USDA meeting indicated lactoferrin was effective
against more than 30 different kinds of harmful bacteria, including _E.
coli_, _Salmonella_ and _Campylobacter_. Lactoferrin does not change the
taste, flavor, color or appearance of meat and isn't harmful to humans, the
researchers said.
"We have borrowed a page from Mother Nature," said A.S. Naidu, a medical
microbiologist at California State Polytechnic University-Pomona, where the
treatment was developed. "We have taken a natural compound with
anti-microbial properties and discovered a way to make it work on meat
surfaces to provide a protective barrier against harmful bacteria."
The government recently approved the use of irradiation to treat raw meat,
but it is unclear how customers will react to that.
