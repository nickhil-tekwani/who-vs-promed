Extensive damage to apple crops in Queretaro de Arteaga is reported
due to recent rains brought by hurricane Alex.

A "new" white mould has appeared causing 5 to 10 percent yield loss.
It is feared that it may spread to a total of 6000 ha of apple orchards.

Apple scab is also reported to affect the crops and considered likely
to increase in incidence.

[A large number of fungi can affect apple, and it is not clarified in
the report above whether the "new" white mould is a new pathogen or,
more likely, a known pathogen new to the area or perhaps the country.

Apple scab (also called black spot) is caused by the fungus _Venturia
inaequalis_ and is considered the most economically important disease
of apples worldwide. Infected fruit is often unmarketable, and losses
can be more than 70 percent. The pathogen infects only species of
_Malus_, while other fungi in the same genus are known to cause scab
diseases on different fruit crops. Symptoms may include dark leaf
spots, premature leaf fall, and fruit lesions. Early infections often
result in severely cracked and malformed fruit and are most damaging
since fruit becomes more resistant as it matures.

The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. Spores are
spread with infected plant material, by mechanical means, splashing
rain and carried long distances in air currents. Disease management
is expensive requiring up to 12 fungicide sprays a year in areas
where scab has become established. Apple cultivars vary in their
susceptibility to scab. Resistant varieties are available, but few of
them are currently suitable for commercial production.
