Crypto clue: one person to blame for outbreak
---------------------------------------------
Genetic testing has revealed that Sydney's cryptosporidium outbreak
may have stemmed from a single infected person. The finding means it
is unlikely that an infected animal or environmental conditions, such
as the weather, are to blame. Since the beginning of last month
[February 2009], when the latest outbreak appeared, 628 people have
fallen ill, compared with 482 in all of last year [2008].

Macquarie University researchers say their testing is experimental,
and unlikely to identify the origin of the current outbreak, but they
hope their work will lead to the development of a world-leading,
inexpensive automated test to quickly identify parasite strains
involved in future outbreaks, allowing sources to be rapidly traced
and infections contained.

Michelle Power, of Macquarie's biological sciences department, said
cryptosporidium outbreaks were difficult to trace using existing
technology. There are 2 key parasite "species" that infect people:
_Cryptosporidium hominis_, only contracted by direct human to human
contact, and _Cryptosporidium parvum_, which can also be transmitted by
animals. For each type there were about 40 different strains.

However, virtually nothing was known about which strains were
responsible for most outbreaks. A decade after the contamination of
Warragamba Dam, which forced Sydneysiders to boil their water, "we
still just know that it was cryptosporidium," Dr Power said. "To put
it simply, we're looking for the easiest way to fingerprint the organisms."

With the new test it should be possible to compare results from
individual patients to seek common patterns.

"We could look to see if they had all eaten at the same restaurant,
or been to the same day-care centre or swimming pool."

The NSW Health Department has provided hundreds of fecal samples from
the latest outbreak for testing by a Macquarie University parasite
researcher, Liette Waldron.

"We have analysed about 250 samples from the current outbreak, and
they are all the same strain" of _Cryptosporidium hominis_, Dr Power said.

If it had originated from different sources she would have expected
to see multiple strains. When sporadic cases, reported over the past
12 months, were analysed they identified 24 strains, involving both
the human and animal species.

Dr Power said people who were infected, but not necessarily appearing
ill, usually had 5000 to 10 000 parasites per gram of faeces.
However, some samples from the latest outbreak contained more than 1
million. "The more parasites you see, the more nasty it is."

Over the next 2 years the project, funded by the Australian Research
Council and the Health Department,will "fingerprint" parasites from
up to 4000 cryptosporidium patients.

[Genetic fingerprinting is a very useful tool to identify the spread
of microorganisms in a community and thus to help identify the source
and transmissison routes. The new knowledge that the outbreak
probably has a single human source underlines the importance of
interrupting transmission to control the outbreak. - Mod.EP
