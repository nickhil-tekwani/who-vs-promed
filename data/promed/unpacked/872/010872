In preparation for discussions during JCB-22, where the proposed inclusion
of dengue and tuberculosis in TDR's disease portfolio was to be reviewed, an
informal consultation took place in WHO at the beginning of June 1999.
During this meeting, WHO in-house experts and outside scientists (from the
American, European, Asian and Pacific regions) sought to identify research
gaps, pinpoint research needed, and propose a potential agenda for TDR
activities regarding dengue and dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF).
WHO staff presented an analysis of the global situation for dengue, and an
outline of WHO's ongoing activities in dengue control and vaccine
development. Three discussion groups proposed a list of priority subjects
where TDR could initiate activities:

In social, economic and behavioural research -- cost-benefit and
cost-effectiveness of vector control strategies; social and economic impact;
social, environmental and economic determinants of risk; appropriate
behaviour to promote in endemic communities for reducing risk; and
community-based surveillance systems.
In vector research -- vector biology and behaviour, and transmission
dynamics; community-based strategies for vector control; new/improved tools
for vector control; improvement of current tools for vector surveillance
e.g. GISs; and alternative pesticides for use in emergency situations.
In diagnosis -- antigen detection; serological testing including evaluation
of available recombinant antigens; antigen and genomic characterization of
dengue strains; and simple PCR techniques for routine use.
In pathophysiology -- virulence; early markers of infection; plasma leakage
and coagulopathy; genetic susceptibility; and the molecular basis of
intereference among dengue viruses.
In vaccine discovery and development -- definition of a vaccine product
profile; continued support to ongoing work on live tetravalent vaccines;
development of new technologies e.g. use of live clones to construct
chimeric viruses, and subunit vaccines; and animal models.
The global pandemic of dengue, which began after World War II, has
intensified over the last 15 years as the geographic distribution of dengue
viruses and their mosquito vectors has expanded and epidemics have increased
dramatically. The reasons for the global emergence are complex and related
to social and environmental factors associated with uncontrolled
urbanization, inadequate supply of piped water, increased movement of human
populations, and substandard housing and waste management.
At present, the only methods for controlling or preventing dengue and DHF
rely on controlling the mosquito vector. Developing appropriate and
efficient vector control methods, improving laboratory diagnosis and case
management of patients, and developing an effective vaccine are therefore
the primary objectives of research and capability strengthening.
