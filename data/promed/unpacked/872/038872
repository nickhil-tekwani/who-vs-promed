The Bhopal Health department, on [Tue 12 Jun 2018], has issued alert in the state after 2 kids - one each from Vidisha and Hoshangabad, died of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in Hamidia Hospital. Malaria Officer Akhilesh Dubey said, "As per the alert, hospitals have been directed to conduct Japanese encephalitis test on the patients which complain of cough and fever.

Teams have been constituted to conduct door to door surveys at war footing." Another patient of Ashok Nagar is still undergoing treatment in AIIMS, Bhopal. A 14-year-old native of Puranpura village in Vidisha and a 3-year-old native of Gohikheda village in Hoshangabad were referred to Hamidia Hospital after the test confirmed that their blood samples were Japanese encephalitis positive.

Their treatment was carried on as per the established guidelines and medical protocol. Their blood samples have been sent to AIIMS, Bhopal for tests. National Vector borne control programme officer Dr Himanshu Jaiswal said, "We have advised the hospitals to be alerts on the basis of advisory. If patients get timely consultation then there is [no reason] to panic."

"JEV is prevalent in UP [Uttar Pradesh], Bihar, and Jharkhand [states] and 2 deaths were also reported last year [2017]. So if deaths or cases increase, government will consider undertaking mass vaccination."

JEV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, and belongs to the same genus as dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. While most infections result in little or no symptoms, occasional inflammation of the brain occurs -- in these cases symptoms may include headache, vomiting, fever, confusion, and seizure. JEV is the prime cause of viral encephalitis in Asia.

[The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission season is just beginning in India, including Madhya Pradesh state. Cases are much more frequent in northeastern states in India, such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Assam.

Avoidance of mosquito bites as is usually recommended is prudent, but vaccination is the best protective measure. The _Culex_ mosquito vectors can become very abundant seasonally, breeding in wetlands. Vector control is difficult. Control of vector mosquitoes is logistically difficult and expensive. There is no mention in the report above that the 2 cases has been vaccinated.

Frequently, in reports of JE cases in India, acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) of undefined etiology is often mentioned with JE cases, a minority of those hospitalized. In the 2 cases above, AES is not mentioned but their JE virus etiology was laboratory confirmed. - Mod.TY
