Rotaviruses, some of which cause diarrhea, kill more than 600,000 children
worldwide every year, more deaths than any other diarrhea-causing microbe.
In this week's Lancet, Dr Timo Vesikari from the University of Tampere
Medical School in Tampere, Finland, reviews the latest progress in
rotavirus vaccine research. Vesikari says that although having been
infected once does not always prevent getting a second rotavirus infection,
it can reduce the severity of subsequent infections. Therefore, there is
hope that a vaccine might significantly reduce the harm this virus does, he
said.
The most promising vaccine near to approval contains rotaviruses that cause
disease in rhesus monkeys, [viruses into which scientists have inserted
genes from the virus that causes disease in humans, Vesikari said. When
this genetically altered virus, called rhesus rotavirus tetravalent
(RRV-TV) vaccine, is given to a child, it infects the intestine without
causing diarrhea and generates an immune response to four of the most
common human rotavirus strains.
In recent trials in the US, RRV-TV vaccines were able to prevent
reinfection in 57% of the patients and protect against severe
rotavirus-induced diarrhea in 92%. In developing nations, however, where
the virus does the most harm, RRV-TV has proved less effective, reducing
severe diarrhea by only 50-60%. These disappointing results in developing
nations are similar to those seen with earlier versions of rotavirus
vaccines. Why the vaccine so often fails in developing countries is not
known, Vesikari said, but the problem may be that not enough of the altered
virus gets into the intestinal cells to generate a strong immune response,
perhaps because children in the developing world often have other viral
infections that interfere with the uptake of the vaccine.
One way to get around this problem, Vesikari says, is to make an injectable
vaccine. Studies of such vaccines in animals have been promising, but
human trials still need to be done. In the meantime, the oral RRV-TV
vaccine should be approved for use in the US either late this year or early
next, Vesikari said, and should become available in Western Europe soon.
