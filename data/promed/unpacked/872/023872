A comment
---------
As far as I know, no mutant hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection
producing 30 percent mortality among infected persons has ever been
reported to date anywhere. If a virus was involved, just
superinfection of HBV carriers by hepatitis D virus (HDV), also known
as hepatitis delta agent, would be responsible for an outbreak of
acute liver disease with such a high mortality rate, otherwise
additional symptoms may suggest yellow fever or other serious
diseases that may include hepatic involvement as a complication. This
possibility has been, however, apparently ruled-out by laboratory
studies. Since such mutant HBV would represent a novel and most
relevant viral agent, detailed information concerning laboratory
evidences that support such an explanation for the outbreak should be
given by regional or federal health authorities as soon as possible.

One of the 7 doctors arrested in the Indian state of Gujarat for
negligence in a fatal outbreak of hepatitis B, was prosecuted for
manslaughter, reports today's [22 Feb 2009] Times of India newspaper.

The researchers found that most patients who contracted the disease
and eventually died were treated by him. The outbreak was due to the
use of poorly sterilized syringes, experts noted. As of Saturday
night [21 Feb 2009], the death toll in Modasa had reached 35, while
108 others are hospitalized in that locality of Gujarat, said the
newspaper.

A doctor who runs a clinic opposite the Modasa public health centre
is the 1st doctor accused of murder, while 6 others face various
charges under the Medical Negligence Act. Health officials revealed
that the focus of this outbreak of liver disease has spread to
Malpur, Bayad, and Idar Taluka, all in Sabarkantha district, where
Modasa is also located.
