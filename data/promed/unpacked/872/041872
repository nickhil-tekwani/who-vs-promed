1. Today [6 Oct 2022], the strain of the FMD virus in the above outbreak has been established as serotype O.
2. The strain has been found to be similar to the subspecies and lineage of the virus that hit Israel and the surrounding region during the last year, namely FMDV O/ME-SA/Panasia-2 10-ANT.
3. Please be reminded that the efficacy of the available/used vaccine in the field is regarded 'medium,' protection obtained only after at least 2 vaccinations.

[According to an earlier circular and Israel's follow-up report (FUR) no. 16 to the WOAH, dated 2 Oct 2022 (https://wahis.woah.org/#/in-review/4305), the outbreak started on 30 Sep 2022. This has become the 92nd FMD outbreak since the start of the event on 1 Feb 2022. Earlier, the same topotype caused outbreaks in Jordan and the Palestinian territory (West Bank).

According to FUR no. 16, the affected population was a feedlot that included 260 imported heifers and 250 local calves/heifers, out of which 3 heifers belonging to a group of one-year-old heifers showed clinical symptoms. Their last vaccination had been applied on 18 Jul 2022.

Lehavot [Lahavot] Habashan is 9.7 km [6 mi] distant from Kibbutz Snir, where the 91st outbreak had reportedly started on 12 Jul 2022; it was declared resolved 18 Jul [2022], since the batch of fattening calves, of which 7 animals were clinically affected, was slaughtered. The affected population in Snir was described as follows: "Feedlot, drooling and mouth lesions. The symptoms [were detected] in a group of calves before slaughter; [they had been] vaccinated in April 2022." A map, presenting both locations, is available at https://tinyurl.com/yc6m5yxv.

The source of the infection in the current event, about 10 weeks after the outbreak in the feedlot in adjacent Snir, deserves to be studied. The continued (renewed?) circulation of the virus needs an explanation.

The protection conferred by the vaccine applied against the causative FMDV O/ME-SA/Panasia-2 10-ANT strain is partial. Matching trials are warranted; their results are of significance, regionally.

A map presenting all 92 outbreaks is available at the FUR no. 16 URL above (click "open map"). - Mod.AS
