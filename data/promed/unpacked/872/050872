A significant freshwater fish kill 15 km [9.3 mi] west of Albany earlier this month [February 2013] has been attributed to a large bloom of blue-green algae affecting the waterway.

Residents in Elleker living adjacent to Marbellup Brook first notified water authorities of the bloom at the end of January [2013] when hundreds of fish were found dead along a 1.4 km [0.9 mi] stretch of water within the Torbay catchment area.

Phytoplankton analysis of water samples taken from Marbellup Brook by the Department of Water confirmed the bloom was cyanobacteria _Nodularia spumigena_, a species not uncommon to waterways in the region.

_Nodularia_ is known to produce a liver-damaging hepatotoxin that can adversely affect birds and mammals, but evidence in the water samples showed no sign of any microalgae species toxic to fish.

Department of Water south coast regional manager Brett Ward says analysis indicated the algal bloom was in late stages of decomposition when samples were taken.

"During the decomposition phase [of an algal bloom] oxygen is taken up, which often depletes the system, as indicated by the very low oxygen levels present at the time of sampling," he says. "This supports the likely cause of the fish deaths being due to the low oxygen levels."

At least 100 black bream and 5 mullet were officially recorded dead.

However, department staff were unable to obtain suitable fish samples for analysis due to decomposition, thus were unable to conclusively state oxygen depletion caused the fish-kill event.

Low rainfall over winter resulting in reduced stream flow, combined with recent hot weather has been attributed to the increased risk of algal blooms, which according to many Elleker residents have been a common occurrence throughout the Torbay catchment for 25 years.

The Water Corporation has installed a temporary pumping operation in the affected area to help improve water circulation, aiming to minimise reformation of large algae blooms.

[_Nodularia spumigena_ is a filamentous, planktonic, photosynthetic, diazotrophic, bloom-forming cyanobacterium. It is usually found in salty or brackish waters.

_Nodularia spumigena_ produces the hepatotoxin nodularin. Hepatotoxins affect the liver. Higher salinity levels and lower ultraviolet radiation lead to more production of the nodularin toxin. Uptake of nodularin by zooplankton possibly leads to its introduction into the food web. The bioaccumulation of nodularin in fish does have acute effects, with a considerable impact in the liver architecture. So, although the lack of oxygen might be linked to the fish-kill, a direct effect of nodularin should not be ruled out.

Due to the bioaccumulation throughout some components the food web, caution should be taken as there is potential risk for human health. People should avoid consuming animals that accumulate the toxins, such as clams, oysters, mussels and scallops.
