Bovine brucellosis - Fiji Islands
---------------------------------
A syndrome of abortion, weak calves and increasing occurrence of
retained afterbirth in a number of dairy cattle herds on the main
island of Fiji (Viti Levu) has been investigated by the Fiji Ministry
of Primary Industries. Reports indicate the syndrome has been
occurring since February 2009.

Preliminary analysis for brucellosis of 2429 sera collected from 9
herds in June 2009 by Rose Bengal test identified 236 strongly
reactive sera from 6 of the herds tested. A sub-sample of RBT
reactive sera was subsequently analysed with the assistance of the
Queensland Department of Primary Industries in Australia by both CFT
and ELISA for Brucella. Serology results were 35/50 sera positive by
CFT (titres ranging from 1/16 to 1/4096) and 48/50 sera positive by ELISA.

Culture results are currently pending. Further serological analysis
is to be conducted. Pre-emptive slaughter of reactor cattle has been
undertaken in a number of herds.

Investigation of the source of the outbreak is ongoing. Fiji
conducted a test and slaughter program for bovine brucellosis in the
1980s and subsequently declared freedom from the disease in 1989.
Fiji is believed to be free from Brucella melitensis. Brucella suis
is known to be present in some sectors of the pig population but
recent survey information is not available.

[Ian Peebles' detailed report in response to our yesterday's RFI is
gratefully acknowledged. Should the preliminary diagnosis be
definitely confirmed, preferably by the culturing of the bacterium
and its phagetyping, the source of infection remains to be discovered.

It would be interesting to note if there have been any suspected
human exposures/infections.

For further information on the diagnostic methods, subscribers are
referred to chapter 2.4.3. - 'Bovine brucellosis' in OIE's
