2050 Cases Of Hepatitis Discovered Among Citizens, Residents
------------------------------------------------------------
The Director of the Public Health Department at the Ministry of Health Yusuf Mindkar disclosed 2050 cases of hepatitis among citizens. Some of the domestic workers were discovered in Kuwait in 2011, reports the Al-Seyassah daily news paper. Mindkar said these cases include 245 cases of hepatitis A, 766 hepatitis B, and 1039 hepatitis C.

Meanwhile, the KD 120 000 budget [425 000 USD approximately] allocated for the overseas treatment program may not be enough to cover all the expenses, especially after the implementation of the new bylaw, reports the Al-Anba daily, quoting sources. Even if the number of citizens undergoing treatment abroad had declined, there might be a need to increase the budget later due to soaring treatment costs, sources explained.

On the other hand, sources said the payment of bonuses to employees assigned in the evening clinics will be completed within one to 2 months. Sources disclosed the proposed linking of the Health Ministry budget with that of its finance counterpart has yet to be approved.

[Both hepatitis A and hepatitis B are vaccine preventable diseases, and some forms of hepatitis C virus infection respond to treatment. However, all that comes at a cost. It would be interesting to learn in detail how the Kuwait Government is tackling this situation, and what proportion of the national health budget has been spent on treatment overseas.
