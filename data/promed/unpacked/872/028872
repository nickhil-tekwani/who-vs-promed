Dr. Sompong Jarungjittanusont, Public Health Officer of Buriram province, says that the dengue fever situation in the area is still cause for concern.

This year's [2012] rainy season has seen heavy rains and floods in many areas, creating the conditions for the disease to spread faster. Since the beginning of the year [2012], there have been 1672 dengue patients seeking treatment at hospitals throughout the province. Of this number, one died.

Most patients are in the age range of 5 to 10 years. The 2nd most afflicted age group are those aged between 10 and 14 years. The disease is spreading fast in 5 districts, namely Chamni, Noan Suwan, Lam Plaimat, Nang Rong and Khu Muang.

Health stations in every district have been instructed to spray disinfectants to destroy breeding grounds of mosquitoes. Volunteers in every village, numbering more than 27 000, have been tasked with destroying mosquito larvae by applying abate sand granules. The volunteers are also working to educate people about how to stop the spread of dengue fever.
