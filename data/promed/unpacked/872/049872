Epidemic in Zacapa
-------------------
Approximately 15 persons with fever, headache and dehydration were taken
yesterday to the Health Center of Gualan, Zacapa, the Voluntary Firemen
confirmed last night. The health workers [emergency medical technicians]
indicated they had taken 4 of the cases to the National Hospital in Zacapa,
due to their delicate states.
The personnel on call at these health facilities confirmed that the group,
containing adults and children, were under observation and were undergoing
laboratory examinations to determine what the illness was [causing their
symptoms].
On his part, the director of the hospital of Zacapa, Rodolfo Sipaque,
expressed that the symptoms [with] which the patients presented were fever,
dehydration and headache.
In addition, the Minister of Health, Mario Bolanos, expressed that the
cases could be due to malaria or dengue.
"Although we have not determined if it is the case, they are being treated
for meningitis, a diagnosis that can only be made through laboratory
confirmation", expressed the physician.
A Health Commission will leave today for the location [Zacapa] in order to
conduct analyses and verify what type of disease is responsible for the
illness in the affected.
The [health] official pointed out that they are presently awaiting the
confirmation of the disease that affected the 15 persons in Gualan.
An outbreak of meningitis last week left 15 children dead in the National
Hospital of Quetzaltenango. Four more persons are under observation in the
Roosevelt Hospital [in the capital city].
