After 27 days in a coma, a 62-year-old woman died at the Hospital San
Leonardo, in Castellammare di Stabia, Naples. She was affected by
avian chlamydiosis contracted from her parrot
(<http://www.tgcom.mediaset.it/cronaca/articoli/articolo479300.shtml>
in Italian>.)

The woman had been in a coma since the end of March 2010. One of her
parrots had died a few days earlier, the necropsy by the Istituto
Zooprofilattico di Portici determined that he was infected by
_Chlamydophila_ (formerly _Chlamydia_) _psittaci_
(<http://www.stabiachannel.it/news/index.asp?idnews=14170> in Italian)

It does not appear that a report was sent to the OIE.

[ProMED-mail thanks Cristiana Senni for this report.

_Chlamydophila psittaci_ has been isolated from about 100 bird
species, but most human _C. psittaci_ infections result from exposure
to pet psittacine birds. Transmission has been documented from other
birds, however, including doves, pigeons, birds of prey, and shore birds.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human
disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically
associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and
cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks,
pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by
inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large
amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally
imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated
can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be
fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct
exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through
the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such
as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective
equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by
free-ranging birds, if contact with birds and their droppings is
likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet
store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and
veterinarians. - Mod.LL]
