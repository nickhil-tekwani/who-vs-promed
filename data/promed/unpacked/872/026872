Rain Could Worsen West Nile Virus Fever Outbreak
------------------------------------------------
HAIFA: Forecasts for rain in the coming days have raised concern of a
possible new wave of West Nile fever, after 2 more people died yesterday
from the disease, bringing the total number of fatalities to 19.
Health Ministry Director-General Shuki Shemer warned yesterday that
accumulation of water on the ground while the weather remains relatively
warm could increase the mosquito population. Most experts agree that
stagnant water and warm conditions are the ideal breeding conditions for
mosquitoes which are as yet the sole known carriers of the disease.
In a Knesset address, he emphasized that the outbreak was brought under
control in New York by insecticides. By spraying the water sources where
mosquitoes are nesting, the problem can be overcome here, Milo added. Light
rain is forecast in the North today, spreading to central districts
tomorrow. The rain in both regions tomorrow is expected to be sporadic but
possibly heavy in places, and may even be accompanied by some isolated
thunderstorms. The rain, which would normally be welcomed after the long hot
summer and in light of the water crisis, is expected to end Friday. It will
be cooler than usual, with a gradual rise in temperatures beginning
Saturday. That is what worries health experts, in light of the spread of
West Nile fever by mosquitoes in the summer.
However, some experts believe the methods used to deal with the mosquito
menace are inappropriate. Dr. Uri Marinov, former director-general of the
Environment Ministry, said the use of chemical insecticides and pesticides
in most developed countries was proving ineffectual. Mutations had occurred
which were immune to the various sprays and new methods had to be developed,
including the use of biological agents to destroy mosquitoes. Furthermore,
Marinov told Israel Radio that blanket spraying in urban area is less
effective than tackling the problem at its source in the stagnant waters
where the mosquitoes breed and live. He said farmers have developed
biological agents to erase the threat by attacking the larvae of the
developing insects. This is the best long-term solution and should also be
adopted in urban areas where there are pools of sewage or standing
water.

West Nile Virus and Ticks
-------------------------
A second elderly resident of Kibbutz Kabri died today 25 Sep 2000) of West
Nile Fever. [Previously} at Kabri, there was shock, alarm and confusion at
the weekend, following the death of one of the settlement's founders and the
hospitalization of three other members - all due to West Nile virus
infection. What was perplexing for kibbutz members is the fact that they had
treated mosquito breeding sites and also resorted to "fogging" the area when
the first case of the disease was diagnosed. "We didn't have a mosquito
problem," said one member. "And we don't know what has caused the outbreak.
"Neither do health ministry officials. "There is not always a direct link
between the appearance of the disease and the presence of mosquitoes," says
Health Ministry Deputy Director-General Dr. Boaz Lev. "Kabri is an example
of that."It's possible that mosquitoes from a neighboring settlement
infected people. Or there was some subtle change in the ecological balance
that we don't yet understand."Kibbutz Kabri does have an abundance of
pigeons, which are now being tested for the disease. If the birds prove to
be infected, it could raise another disturbing possibility: that the virus
was not transmitted by mosquitoes at all, but by ticks.
Although mosquitoes are commonly thought to be the only living things that
can infect people with the virus, the United States Center for Disease
Control (CDC) suggests another scenario: "In general, only infected
mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus. However, ticks may transmit West Nile
virus between birds and, possibly, from infected birds to people," according
to the Center's Division of Epidemiology and Immunization web site.
"Although no West Nile virus was isolated from ticks in the United States
during the 1999 outbreak, ticks may prove to be vectors of West Nile Virus
transmission in the future," reports the CDC, which then sounds this
warning: " It is important to realize that infected ticks cannot be killed
by aerial insecticide spraying as mosquitoes can, and that infected ticks,
therefore, may prove to be a very important vector in the possible future
spread of West Nile virus in the United States."
Lev says, in response, that "to the best of my knowledge, ticks do not
transmit the virus."
