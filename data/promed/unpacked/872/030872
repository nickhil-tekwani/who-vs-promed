From: "Dr. Luciano T. Talens" <amang@laguna.net>

In the Philippines, there are at least four fungi that cause varying
degrees of blight in mango. They are as follows: _Macrophoma_,
_Colletotrichum_, _Diplodia_ and _Pestalocia_.
To combat these fungal infections, various fungicides are used based on
IPM [integrated pest management and environmental concerns.
