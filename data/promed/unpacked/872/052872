Quarantine measures are being taken to prevent golden potato nematodes. The
Regnum News Agency correspondent has been informed about this by the
Ministry of Agriculture and Trade of Kamchatskiy kray [territory] on 3 Dec
[2008]. Ten lots with total area of 0.53 hectares [1.3 acres] have been
found infected with golden potato nematode in the territories of
Petropavlosk, Kamchatskiy, Vilyuchinsk, Elizovo cities, and Milkovo
village. Quarantine phytosanitary measures will be implemented by the
regional Rosselkhoznadzor administration [Federal Service for Veterinary
and Phytosanitary Surveillance]. Strict control will be in place in
airports, naval ports, and postal offices where all cargo and parcels will
be inspected for potatoes, potato seed tubers, and seedlings.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale
(_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in
potato. They can also infect other solanaceous crops and weeds, and cysts
containing viable eggs can survive in the soil for up to 20 years. Disease
management includes exclusion and crop rotation with non-host species. Race
identification is important for the use of resistant crop cultivars. Both
PCNs have been included on the alert list of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO). For more information on these pathogens please see
previous ProMED-mail posts and links below.

While pale PCN has never been reported from Russia and its immediate
neighbours, golden PCN is widely distributed in the Eurasian area. Previous
reports from Russia include Kurgan and Altai in 2005 (ProMED-mail:
20050809.2322 and 20050707.1921), and recent PCN detections from other
south western regions in July 2008 (Chelyabinsk; ProMED-mail:
20080714.2138) and in October 2008 (Tomsk; information by Corr.BA) were
also considered likely to be golden PCN. But this seems to be the 1st
report of golden PCN from as far east in Russia as Kamchatka.

The 3 PCN detections in Russia in 2008 are from locations well separated by
distance and are not likely to be due to recent spread because these
pathogens need 6-7 years to build up numbers sufficient for detection. It
is possible, however, that the PCNs in the different locations may be due
to contaminated seed potatoes distributed from a central source in the
past. This was reported to have occurred for _Potato spindle tuber viroid_
strains (ProMED-mail: 20070423.1323), and we would be most grateful for any
further information on possible modes of spread of golden PCN in Russia.
