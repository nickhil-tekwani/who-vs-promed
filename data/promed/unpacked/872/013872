Wyoming cow found with brucellosis
----------------------------------
Yesterday [11 Feb 2011], the Wyoming Livestock Board announced that
it had received notice from animal health officials in Montana that a
Wyoming cow at a Montana auction had serological evidence of
brucellosis. The adult beef cow was from a ranch in Park County. State
animal health officials currently are investigating the case, and
making plans for further testing of the cow, as well as the herd she
was from.

According to assistant state veterinarian Bob Meyer, a diagnosis of
brucellosis in a Wyoming cow is no longer as big a threat to the
state's cattle industry as it used to be.

In the past, 2 herds diagnosed with brucellosis within 2 years meant
that state would lose Class Free status and would be subjected to more
stringent testing requirements. On 27 Dec 2010, the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) published an interim rule amending
the brucellosis regulations.

Meyer explained that the new interim rule says that, "if you have
cases of brucellosis in your state, like we do -- and if you're
responding appropriately (like we are, by testing, doing epidemiology,
making sure the outbreak is contained and are implementing a
brucellosis management plan) -- then the USDA will no longer
automatically downgrade your status."

As John Clifford, chief veterinary officer for the USDA's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), explained, "The brucellosis
program has been very successful at reducing the disease in this
country ... These new regulations will help us better address the
current situation and continue to move toward our long-term goal of
complete eradication."

"That's good news," Meyers said. "The rest of our producers aren't
threatened because of this outbreak. In fact," he said, "I'm
responding to the outbreak as we speak." Meyers then returned to a
meeting with herd owners.

[The move by the USDA to not strip a state of its "free" status is
likely driven by budget constraints. Buying out a herd of cattle
because of a disease becomes an expensive proposition. Likewise, the
US is moving close to eradication of the disease in domestic animals.

One of the last and controversial strongholds of the disease is the
wildlife feeding grounds of the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA). The
feeding areas are hugely popular; they bring in tourist dollars to the
area, which relies on tourism for much of its living. These feeding
grounds stir controversy among conservationist and disease-control
authorities. Brucellosis can be transmitted between wildlife and
domestic stock. Congregating the animals may assist the spread of the
disease among wildlife, which subsequently can spread the disease to
domestic stock. Because of the many factions that clash over the GYA,
it is likely to remain the last brucellosis hot spot in the US.

For the livestock producers in the states and areas bordering the
GYA, USDA's action is indeed good news.

Interestingly, while authorities with the USDA stated that all the
USA had obtained a brucellosis free status in domestic stock, the
disease reappeared in Texas recently. Texas does not have the
situation of having the GYA as a neighbor as does Wyoming. But it is
an indication that the disease may still be lurking out there
somewhere besides the GYA. - Mod.TG
