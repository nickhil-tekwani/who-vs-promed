One man died of anthrax, while 56 others contracted the disease, after
eating meat from an infected animal in Gokwe. An official with the
Department of Veterinary Services in Gokwe South said the man was from the
Lutope area, where the disease is prevalent.
An outbreak of anthrax was reported in the area last week [final week of
November 2004]. He said that 4 cows had died from the disease in Mbumbuzi,
and added that other affected areas included Lukwekwe and Nembudziya, where
the Veterinary Services Department was conducting massive vaccination of
animals in the area. "We have stopped all cattle sales in the areas where
anthrax has been reported, as well as movement of cattle, to minimize cases
of healthy animals contaminating the disease," he said. ["Contaminating"
sic. I suspect the journalist's spell checker let him down. - Mod.MHJ]
The Midlands provincial medical director, Dr. Simon Chihanga, said that
there were 56 confirmed cases of anthrax in humans, but said he had not yet
received the report about the man who had died from the disease. "Cattle
are still dying, especially in the Musadzi area, and we have been providing
health education to villagers about the disease. Villagers have been
supportive and co-operative on the prevention of the further spread of the
disease," he said. He said the local veterinary surgeon had run out of
vaccines and was waiting for the arrival of new stocks to continue with the
vaccinating program.

[Gokwe, in Midlands Province, is some 230 km west of Harare. Of note is
that none of these place names match those of the previous posting. So, it
would seem that we probably have a new series of outbreaks in north central
Zimbabwe from those reported in the northeast of the country. I just wish I
had a more detailed Atlas for Africa, but one has only what one's library
has. That they are vaccinating in so many areas now, and that the
veterinary services have run out of vaccine, would suggest that this is not
the usual regional scenario in which one affected carcass can infect 10 or
more people. One may presume that there is now an extensive series of
outbreaks in the country. An informed report would be appreciated. - Mod.MHJ]
