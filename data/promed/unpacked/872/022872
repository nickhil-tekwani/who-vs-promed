Ebola: New outbreak in Kasai Occidental, central DR Congo
---------------------------------------------------------
The Minister of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),
Augustus Mupipi Mukulumanya, confirmed in a news release on Friday [6
Nov 2009] in Kinshasa, the presence of Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus
in the city of Kaluamba located in the health area of Mweka, Kasai
Occidental (central DRC). An alert has been declared.

Calling on appropriate organizations, including the World Health
Organization (WHO), to support the DRC in coordinating the response to
this epidemic, the Minister said it's the 2nd time that this disease
has occurred in the health zone of Mweka. The 1st outbreak had
occurred in that area between April and October 2007 [see ProMED
archives below].

Since December 17, 2008, there have been 13 cases, including 9 deaths,
according to statistical data from the medical inspector of the
province of Kasai Occidental.

In the DRC, Ebola hemorrhagic fever was previously notified in the
provinces of Ecuador (in Yambuku in 1976 and Tandala in 1977),
Bandundu (Kikwit in 1995), in Eastern province (in Durba in 1999 and
2000) [but see comment below] and Kasai Occidental (Mweka in 2007).

[The hemorrhagic fever in Durba was caused by a related filovirus
called Marburg virus, not Ebola virus ? see ProMED archive Marburg
hemorrhagic fever - Congo, DR (05) 20000322.0402.
This appears to be an Ebola outbreak that is sparking along with
sporadic cases for a year, probably due to migratory fruit bats that
frequent the area -- see ProMED archive Ebola hemorrhagic fever, fruit
bat - Congo DR, 2007 20090530.2014. ? Mod.JW]
