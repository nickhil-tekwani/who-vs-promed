Recently, pineapple disease has been found in serious proportions in sugarcane plantations in the Bid district of Maharashtra.

Survey reports revealed about 85-90 percent losses in germination of the sugarcane setts. The fungus affects the setts primarily within one week of planting and infects mainly through cut ends and spreads rapidly.

In India, the disease has been reported from all major sugarcane growing states. It has been reported to cause 10-15 tonne losses per hectare in yield.

[Pineapple disease (PD) of sugarcane is caused by the fungus _Ceratocystis paradoxa_. The name refers to the characteristic smell of the rotting cane, like decaying pineapples. Symptoms include reddening of affected cane, blackening and shrinking of vascular bundles to form a hollow core, yellowing and wilting of leaves leading to the death of plants. Affected setts fail to root and mostly decay before or soon after sprouting, leading to reduced crop stands. Disease development is favoured by delayed sett germination.

PD is mainly a disease of planting material (setts), with the fungus entering the host through the cut ends. Ratoon crops can also be affected. The pathogen may occasionally also affect standing crops, entering via sites of mechanical or insect damage. The fungus lives in the soil and can be spread by plant material, mechanical means, water and soil. Disease management may include pre-treatments of setts with fungicides, cultural and phytosanitary measures, crop rotation, use of certified disease-free planting material and resistant varieties.
