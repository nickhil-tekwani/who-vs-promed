Children born in the United States are 6 times more likely to have tuberculosis (TB) if at least one parent was born abroad, according to a study published online [10 Feb 2014] in Pediatrics.

The finding prompted an accompanying editorial calling for the United States to help reduce TB infections in poorer countries. "We cannot eradicate TB domestically until better TB control is attained in high-prevalence nations, especially those from which the United States receives many immigrants and visitors," write editorialists Jeffrey R Starke, MD, and Andrea T Cruz, MD, MPH, from the Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.

Previous studies have shown that more than 60 percent of US TB adult cases occur among foreign-born individuals and that 90 percent of pediatric cases occur among US-born children. Until now, however, no one has surveyed US children to see how their incidence of TB relates to either their country of origin or that of their parents.

To fill that gap, Jenny Pang, MD, MPH, from the Department of Epidemiology, University of Washington, Seattle, and colleagues from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and from other health departments and universities tallied TB diagnoses among children younger than 5 years in 20 catchment areas around the country. They identified 364 cases, which accounted for 49.6 percent of all TB cases in young children reported to the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System in 2005 and 2006.

In addition to using routine case reports and local health department data, the investigators conducted interviews with the children's parents or guardians to glean information about immigration. They found that 303 (83 percent) children with TB were born in the United States and 61 (17 percent) were born outside of the United States. Of those born in the United States, 64 percent (194) had at least one foreign-born parent, 25 percent (76) had both parents born in the United States, and 11 percent (33) had parents whose birth countries were unknown.

The researchers then compared the incidence of TB with population figures for the catchment areas from the US Census. Rates of TB per 100 000 population in children younger than 5 years were 2.57 for all children, 24.03 for children who were born outside the United States, 4.81 for US-born children with at least a single foreign-born parent, and 0.75 for US children with both parents born in the United States.

Overall, more than half of the cases (53 percent) occurred among US-born children with one or more foreign-born parent. When the authors included the 33 children with unknown parental birthplaces in the group with foreign-born parents, that group's TB rate increased to 5.61 per 100 000 children. Including them in the group with US-born parents increased that group's rate to 1.08.

In an observational substudy, the researchers found that more than half of the parents were from Mexico, and nearly half of them reported being undocumented at the time of US entry. One-tenth of them expressed concerns that they or their children would be deported if they sought treatment for their child.

The editorialists argue that not enough attention is being paid to TB in the United States because of the mistaken perception that the disease is under control here. They cite estimates from the World Health Organization that there were 530 000 cases of TB, with 74 000 deaths, among non-HIV-infected children worldwide in 2012. In addition, they note that previous estimates suggest every US dollar invested in TB programs in Mexico would save healthcare providers in the United States USD 3. Therefore, they call for a campaign to eradicate TB by fully funding programs outlined in the Roadmap for Childhood Tuberculosis, a plan developed by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other US and international organizations.

[The news report above refers to an article (Pang J, Teeter LD, Katz DJ, et al: Epidemiology of Tuberculosis in Young Children in the United States. Pediatrics. Published ahead of print 10 Feb 2014, doi:10.1542/peds.2013-2570). The abstract of the article is available at http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/02/04/peds.2013-2570 and is reproduced below:

Objectives
----------
"To estimate tuberculosis (TB) rates among young children in the United States by children's and parents' birth origins and describe the epidemiology of TB among young children who are foreign-born or have at least one foreign-born parent.

Methods
-----------
"Study subjects were children younger than 5 years old diagnosed with TB in 20 US jurisdictions during 2005-2006. TB rates were calculated from jurisdictions' TB case counts and American Community Survey population estimates. An observational study collected demographics, immigration and travel histories, and clinical and source case details from parental interviews and health department and TB surveillance records.

Results
-------
"Compared with TB rates among US-born children with US-born parents, rates were 32 times higher in foreign-born children and 6 times higher in US-born children with foreign-born parents. Most TB cases (53 percent) were among the 29 percent of children who were US-born with foreign-born parents. In the observational study, US-born children with foreign-born parents were more likely than foreign-born children to be infants (30 percent vs 7 percent), Hispanic (73 percent vs 37 percent), diagnosed through contact tracing (40 percent vs 7 percent), and have an identified source case (61 percent vs 19 percent); two-thirds of children were exposed in the United States.

Conclusions
-----------
"Young children who are US-born of foreign-born parents have relatively high rates of TB and account for most cases in this age group. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of adult source cases, effective contact investigations prioritizing young contacts, and targeted testing and treatment of latent TB infection are necessary to reduce TB morbidity in this population."

Timely reporting and contact investigation of suspected cases of TB is crucial in prevention of TB among children. Children most commonly develop TB as a result of exposure to a case of active pulmonary TB in their immediate environment, usually in their household. Children exposed to active TB must be evaluated for latent TB infection (LTBI); children with LTBI are at high risk for progressing to primary TB and its sequelae.

In the US, infants and children are treated for LTBI if they have a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or are exposed to a person who has contagious TB (after exclusion of active TB disease in the infant or child and regardless of the child's TST results). Exposed children with an initially negative TST are retested in 3 months after exposure to contagious TB has ended. If the 2nd test result is positive, treatment is continued for a full course of treatment for LTBI. If the 2nd test result is negative, treatment may be stopped (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/treatment.htm).

In the US, TB due to _Mycobacterium bovis_ continues to be reported, primarily in immigrants who acquire the infection in their countries of origin where _M. bovis_ infection remains endemic, or in persons of Hispanic ethnicity as a consequence of ingesting dairy foods made from unpasteurized milk of _M. bovis_-infected cows and smuggled across the Mexico-U.S. border (see Levison ME: _Mycobacterium bovis_: An Underappreciated Pathogen. Curr Infect Dis Rep 2008, 10(6): 444-6 and Dankner WM, Davis CE: _Mycobacterium bovis_ as a significant cause of tuberculosis in children residing along the United States-Mexico border in the Baja California region. Pediatrics. 2000; 105(6): E79; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835092).

The Medscape news report above adds that the researchers found more than half of the parents of infected children were from Mexico. However, the news report gives no information on the identity of the mycobacterial species isolated from the infected individuals. Frequently, laboratories will report results of a positive culture as "Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex", which includes several genetically related mycobacterial species that can cause tuberculosis -- _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ and _M. bovis_, as well as the less frequent human pathogens _M. africanum_, bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), _M. microti_, _M. canettii_, and _M. caprae_. _M. bovis_ is resistant to the anti-TB drug pyrazinamide (PZA), an essential component of the initial 8-week phase of the 6-month drug treatment regimen. If the initial phase of treatment does not include PZA, treatment must be continued for a total of 9 months, rather than 6 months (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm).

TST is the preferred method for testing of children under the age of 5 years (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/LTBI/diagnosis.htm) because of limited data on the use of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) in this age group (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5905.pdf).
