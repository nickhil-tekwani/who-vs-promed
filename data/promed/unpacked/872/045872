On Mon 26 May 2014, Dr Ibrahima Kourouma, prefectural health director, announced on national radio that 10 people, mostly children, had died in a village in the prefecture of Koubia (North), about 300 km [186 mi] from Conakry, as a result of anthrax caused by eating meat from an infected animal.

The same source noted that 9 other children are hospitalized in the health district of Koubia where one patient, a toddler, died on [Mon 26 May 2014]. Stressing that the disease was detected last March [2014] in the locality where "the people do not pay attention because of their ignorance," Dr Kourouma gave assurance that the disease has been limited through arrangements made, including the free distribution of drugs.

[Though livestock anthrax is rife in Guinea with significant numbers of outbreaks and livestock losses, there are no prior OIE reports of it in this prefecture, which might explain the diagnostic problems.
