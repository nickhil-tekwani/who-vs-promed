[In post 20060214.0487, dealing with the Tumbu fly as a cause of
myiasis in the NW Province of South Africa, we asked what percentage
of recorded infections were from non-humans, such as dogs. The
following response, received from Andrew Leisewitz, is gratefully
acknowledged. - Mod.AS]

Although I cannot give figures, as a veterinarian working in the busy
1st opinion practice of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Academic
Hospital, I can tell you that this year [2006] has been a
particularly bad year for Tumbu fly myiasis in dogs. Some years pass
without us seeing any cases, but this year there have been several a
week diagnosed in dogs from the local area served by Hospital (the
northern regions of Pretoria).
During the 16 years I have worked in this area, I have never seen a
case in a domestic cat. Their fastidious grooming habits probably
preclude infestation.

[It would appear that as in so many other situations, dogs are both the main
and reservoir hosts, with humans being more incidental hosts. Puppies are
especially susceptible to infection. Rodents, especially domestic rats
(_Rattus_ species) are often important reservoir hosts, and it seems likely
rodents were the original hosts before dogs and man became involved. Cats are
rarely infected. Larvae have also been recorded from monkeys and the mongoose,
and it is probably that other mammals are also somtimes infected. - Mod. MS]
