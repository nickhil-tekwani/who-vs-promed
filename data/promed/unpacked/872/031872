Human cases in Pakistan could hint of person-to-person spread.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A team of experts from the World Heath Organization (WHO) is making
its way north in Pakistan to investigate a cluster of at least 8
cases of avian flu in people living near the Afghan border. They will
be seeking to establish whether the disease is spreading, and whether
the cases were caused by human-to-human transmission. Cases of bird
flu continue to occur worldwide, mostly in Indonesia, and this is the
colder time of year when flu is expected to hit hardest in the
northern hemisphere. But this latest outbreak is worrying in that it
involves the biggest batch of closely related cases since a cluster
of 8 infected people was reported in Indonesia in May 2006. "So far,
we are not seeing anything different than in previous instances of
H5N1 outbreaks," says Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for WHO, whose
current information comes from Pakistani authorities.

The Pakistan cases started in mid-November [2007], or possibly
earlier, when 5 family members fell ill in Abbottabad, north of
Islamabad. There, 2 of the brothers have died, one of whom was buried
before he could be tested for H5N1. In December [2007], a man and his
niece in the same town were found to have H5N1. They are thought to
have worked on the same farm as the 1st family affected. Another man
was found to have H5N1 in a nearby town some distance from there.
Another case is suspected but not yet confirmed, which would bring
the cluster to 9.

Pakistan has had repeated outbreaks of avian flu in poultry over the
past 2 years. The WHO team will be tracking down, treating and
testing people who came into contact with the infected cases.
Monitoring for cases in the area will be key to establishing whether
the virus has become more virulent or shows signs of spreading.
Meanwhile, Pakistani health authorities are poring over hospital
records from the past few months to see, retrospectively, whether
there has been any upsurge in the incidence of respiratory illnesses.
Human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, says Hartl, as it
has occurred on a limited basis on several occasions in the past.
Tests of 40 people who have had contact with the patients have so far
all turned up negative. Genetic sequencing will help to pin down the
mode of transmission and whether any important genetic changes have
occurred in the virus.

The Pakistan cluster highlights the obstacles faced by the WHO in
containing the spread should a pandemic strain of H5N1 appear. The
strategy calls for early diagnosis of cases, in the hope that blanket
treatment with antivirals will stamp out an emerging pandemic before
it spirals out of control. Computer models suggest that for this to
have any chance of succeeding, WHO would have a window of 3 weeks for
this diagnosis at most. But although the 1st cases occurred in
mid-November [2007] at the latest, Pakistan only officially informed
WHO on 12 Dec 2007, a day after the first media reports. WHO made the
cases public on 15 Dec 20007.

Last Friday [14 Dec 2007], the WHO also confirmed the 1st case in
Myanmar: a 7-year-old girl from Kyaing Tone Township, Shan State, who
was hospitalized in late November [2007], and has since recovered. A
WHO team has so far found no evidence of infections in any of the
case's contacts or in the area.

[Another version of events with the added information that the 2
deceased brothers and an H5N1-positive man and his H5N1-positive
niece all lived in the same town (Abbottabad), and all worked on the
same farm (previously located in Mansera). Circumstances consistent
with infection from a common source rather than by person-to-person
transmission of virus. - Mod.CP]
