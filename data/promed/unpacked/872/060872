Kayin (Karen) State is seeing a rash of Japanese encephalitis cases this year [2017], prompting a wide-scale vaccine roll out, public health officials say. "Kayin State is one of the areas most affected by Japanese encephalitis," said Dr Tun Min, head of the Kayin State Public Health Department. "Five year old children have been infected the most."

The severe, mosquitoborne virus causes brain inflammation and is endemic to many South East Asian countries. Between 30 and 50 per cent of patients [with neurologic disease - Mod.TY] suffer permanent neurological or psychiatric damage following an infection. Some lose the ability to speak. There is no treatment for the disease, which is vaccine preventable.

In 2016, Kayin State noted a total of 51 Japanese encephalitis cases and 3 patients died. A total of 123 suspected cases have been reported up to October this year [2017], with 35 infections and 4 fatalities recorded. The reason for the increase in recorded cases is not clear.

Hlaingbwe township has borne the brunt of this year's [2017] uptick, according to records from the state public health department.

In order to try and curb the infections, the state public health department is planning to immunize around 500 000 residents, including over 300 000 students and over 150 000 people from 200 rural villages as part of a nationwide Japanese encephalitis vaccination campaign that kicked off this week [week ending Sun 19 Nov 2017].

"My 2 children have been vaccinated at their school, but I don't know the details about the disease," said a Kayin state resident. "I want them [the authorities] to raise awareness by telling parents about the disease and the dos and don'ts. Still, since this is a disease prevention I sent my children to get their regular vaccination as well as vaccination [against Japanese encephalitis]."

The public health department has said it will also provide financial assistance and inoculation supplies to ethnic armed organizations to provide vaccines to around 20 000 children living in 227 villages that are out of the government's reach.

The 1st phase of the vaccination drive will run from 15-23 Nov [2017] and the 2nd will start in December [2017].

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) has been active again this year in Myanmar (2017). An earlier report last year (2016) indicated that there were 173 cases with 19 deaths including 4 children. That report indicated that the Ayeyarwady region had 69 cases and 10 deaths in 22 out of 26 townships in the region. This year (2017) the cases are occurring in Kayin (Karen) state. Because Myanmar is endemic for JE virus, the planned vaccination campaign is prudent and the best measure to prevent infection.

JE vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organisation. Information on different types of recommended vaccines and their schedules is available at http://www.who.int/ith/vaccines/japanese_encephalitis/en/.
