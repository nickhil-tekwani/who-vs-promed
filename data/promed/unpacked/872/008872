[The information below was obtained from the European Commission's website on avian influenza at https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animal-diseases/control-measures/avian-influenza_en:

"In 2018, outbreaks of HPAI of subtype H5N6 were confirmed in poultry in the Netherlands and Germany and in captive birds in the Netherlands and Sweden up to March. [...]

In wild birds, only the HPAI virus of subtype H5N6 has been identified in several member states: Denmark, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, the Slovak Republic, and the UK. On [15 Aug 2018], a last case was detected in a wild swan in Denmark. [...]

In mid-December 2017, the Netherlands detected HPAI of subtype H5N6 in a poultry holding and in captive bird holdings. Based on the genetic analysis of HPAI H5N6 viruses recently detected in Europe and Asia, the EU Reference Laboratory for avian influenza concluded that the European strains can be differentiated from those strains associated with zoonotic infection in Asia. Furthermore, they do not carry any virulence markers strongly associated with human infection risk. There have been no reported human infections with this particular genetic sub-lineage of H5N6. [...]

A detailed overview on the situation in member states and the adopted measures is given in the chronology of events (https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono.pdf) and maps https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_hapai_chrono_map.pdf."

Since the event in Germany was detected in a flock of rare and endangered breeds, this event was reported as highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (infection with) (non-poultry including wild birds). According to the OIE Terrestrial Code Chapter 10.4 on Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses, Article 10.4.1 defines "poultry" as "all domesticated birds, including backyard poultry, used for the production of meat or eggs for consumption, for the production of other commercial products, for restocking supplies of game, or for breeding these categories of birds, as well as fighting cocks used for any purpose. Birds that are kept in captivity for any reason other than those reasons referred to in the preceding paragraph, including those that are kept for shows, racing, exhibitions, competitions, or breeding or selling these categories of birds as well as pet birds, are not considered to be poultry" (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_avian_influenza_viruses.htm). - Mod.CRD
