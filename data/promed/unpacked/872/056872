So far this year (by week 10), 60.980 cases of dengue fever have been
already notified in Brazil. Most of these cases are concentrated in two
states, Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, where 5 cases of DHF [dengue
hemorrhagic fever have also been notified, with one death.
In 1997, provisional data related 251,221 cases, especially at the
Northeastern region of the country with 194,441 notifications. By the end
of 1980 dengue 1 and dengue 4 viruses had been detected at the northern
border with Venezuela, but the outbreak was controlled. However, in April
1986 a large epidemic of dengue 1 started in suburban areas of Rio de
Janeiro. About 1,000,000 infections were estimated to have occurred in Rio
de Janeiro at that time. By 1990 dengue 2 was introduced also in Rio de
Janeiro, spreading to the rest of the country. A total of 696 cases of DHF
have been reported from April 1990 until week 10 of this year. A national
program of vector control must be urgently implemented with a greater
participation of the population.
