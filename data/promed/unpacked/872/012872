The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has confirmed 3 new cases of Lassa fever in Ondo state, including a health worker, with 2 new deaths.

Also, it said that a monkeypox case in Israel on 13 Oct 2018 has travel history from Nigeria.

According to the NCDC, in the reporting week 42 [week of 15 Oct 2018], one new healthcare worker was infected in Ondo state and 41 healthcare workers have been affected since the onset of the outbreak in 7 states -- Ebonyi (16), Edo (15), Ondo (5), Kogi (2), Nasarawa (one), Taraba (one), and Abia (one) with 10 deaths in Ebonyi (5), Kogi (one), Abia (one), Ondo (2), and Edo (one).

The NCDC, which confirmed 2 new cases of monkeypox out of 10 new reported cases, noted that it is following up closely with the Ministry of Health in Israel following the report of a confirmed monkeypox case in the country on 13 Oct 2018 with a travel history from Nigeria.

Meanwhile, Lagos State Governor, Mr Akinwunmi Ambode, will tomorrow [30 Oct 2018] join the Governor-General of Canada, Julie Payette, to inaugurate a new biosecurity laboratory in Lagos to curb any new Ebola outbreak in the state.

In a statement yesterday [28 Oct 2018], the Lagos State Government said the laboratory would be located at the Mainland Hospital in Yaba where the isolation unit used by the state government to contain the 2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak was located.

It said the laboratory, funded by Canada in partnership with the state government, would serve as a single repository for all high-concentration pathogens in the state, adding that it would also help to mitigate post-EVD threats and build capacity for prevention, detection and response to future outbreak.

[Ondo state has been one of the states with the most Lass fever cases this year (2018). It is unfortunate that another healthcare worker is infected. Except for the infected healthcare workers, recent studies indicate that most affected individuals probably acquired their infections from rodent hosts of the virus. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in this wide area. Virus transmission to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (_Mastomys natalensis_ and _M. erythroleucus_) and the African wood mouse (_Hylomycus pamfi_) or their excreta, as was likely the situation in these cases. Rodent control must be undertaken at the village level with individual households using preventive measures. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort.

Images of the 3 rodent reservoir hosts of Lassa fever virus can be seen for _M. natalensis_ mouse at https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/45326-Mastomys-natalensis and _M. erythroleucus_, and _H. pamfi_ at http://punchng.com/nigerias-large-rat-population-threatens-lassa-fever-war/. - Mod.TY
