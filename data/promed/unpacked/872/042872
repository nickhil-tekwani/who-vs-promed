Victorians are being warned about an upsurge in measles cases, with
11 reported this year [2009]. The people infected were 6 men aged
between 18 and 37 and a 36-year-old woman and 4 girls aged from 11
months to 14 years. Six of the people needed hospital treatment.

The illness normally starts with common cold symptoms like fever, a
sore throat, red eyes and a cough. A rash begins about 3-7 days after
the 1st symptoms, generally starting on the face and spreading to the
rest of the body. Victoria's chief health officer, John Carnie, says
anyone with symptoms should phone ahead before turning up at a
hospital or doctor's surgery: "Just say you have fever and a rash,
and if you know you've been in contact with a case of measles, just
let them know, so when you present there, they can isolate you and
prevent other people getting exposed in waiting rooms."

Victoria is having its largest measles outbreak in years. There have
already been 11 cases this year [2009]; there were only 2 in the
whole of last year [2008]. Health officials have warned all
Victorians, especially young adults, to be alert to the symptoms.
They say there is a chance more people may be infected.

The outbreak began in January 2009, with 3 adults and a baby girl
catching the disease. Today [4 Feb 2009], the Department of Human
Services revealed there have been 7 more cases: 3 girls aged up to
14, a 36-year-old woman, and 3 young men. There did not appear to be
a common thread to the cluster of cases, with patients dotted around
the suburbs and as far a field as Gippsland. Six of this year's
[2009] cases have required hospital treatment. If left untreated, the
disease can cause serious illness and lead to pneumonia or other complications.

Victoria's last big measles year was 1999, when there were several
large clusters of cases in the western and eastern suburbs. The
childhood MMR vaccine has made the disease a rare occurrence. Those
most at risk are unvaccinated children over the age of 6 months and
unvaccinated adults aged 26 to 42.

Measles cases in Victoria:
1998: 29
1999: 109
2000: 21
2001: 81
2002: 13
2003: 38
2004: 15
2005: 2
2006: 12
2007: 2
2008: 2
2009: 11 (as of 4 Feb 2009)

[The sporadic nature of the cases is puzzling. Further information is awaited.
