At least 5 dogs at the Oakland city shelter have confirmed cases of canine influenza, according to Oakland Animal Services director Rebecca Katz. "If people can hold onto strays and surrenders for now, we ask them to do so. We're also looking for organizations and other places to divert them to," Katz said on Thursday [20 Jun 2019]. "If any dog comes into the shelter, they're at pretty significant risk of getting it."

While not every dog at the shelter is under quarantine, 5 out of 10 samples the shelter had tested came back positive for the highly contagious virus. Like human flu, dog flu is most dangerous for puppies, seniors, and dogs who are already sick, and deaths are rare. However, an outbreak last year [2018] spread so quickly it killed dozens of dogs, underscoring the importance of early containment.

About 80% of unvaccinated dogs exposed get infected, even if they don't show signs of being sick, so immunization is key for dogs who go to dog parks and other doggy social events. Vaccination requires 2 shots, and immunity can take 4 to 6 weeks to kick in, so it's a good idea to plan ahead if your pet is going to be exposed to new dogs. Every dog is different, though, so ask your vet what's best for your pet.

Signs are similar to human ones, including coughing, sneezing, lethargy and fever. If your dog has a mild case, it's best to keep your dog home and give them lots of water and rest.

If your dog is having trouble breathing or coughing up blood, head to an emergency room. If that happens, vets ask that you call ahead to warn them you're bringing a potentially contagious dog, and leave them in the car when you get there so other patients don't get exposed to the virus. If you pet someone else's dog, make sure to wash your hands and change your clothes before touching yours -- canine flu can stick around on fabric and skin.

Oakland Animal Services is working with several groups, including the University of Wisconsin Shelter Medicine Program and University of California Davis, to contain the virus as quickly as possible. "We've called in the cavalry to help us get through this, and are working step by step to figure it out," Katz said.

[While we are saddened to know this very contagious disease has reared its contagious head again, this article gives some appropriate advice. If you have a sick animal, have touched one, or take one to a veterinary office, be sure to thoroughly wash your hands before touching other animals. Washing your clothes and showering or bathing are critical to help keep the spread of this disease down, and not track it back to your home if you are working in a shelter or a veterinary office.

Canine influenza (CI) or dog flu is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by an influenza A virus. In the USA, CI has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the USA, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain.

"In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate CI virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia, specifically Korea, China, and Thailand. In Asia, this H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs. Since March 2015, thousands of dogs have been confirmed positive for H3N2 CI across the USA" (see https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/FAQs/Pages/Control-of-Canine-Influenza-in-Dogs.aspx).

Healthy dogs can be vaccinated and should be if you must board your animal. There is a vaccine for both strains of the flu mentioned above. If the virus is circulating in your area, avoiding canine social activities (e.g., dog parks, play dates, interactions in the park) may help protect your dog.

Canine influenza viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) are not known to infect humans (see https://www.cdc.gov/flu/canineflu/keyfacts.htm). - Mod.TG

In addition to the above CIV cases, H3N2 was recently confirmed in North Carolina as well (see map at https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal-health-diagnostic-center/veterinary-support/disease-information/canine-influenza-h3n2-updates). It will be interesting to see if these cases originated from virus circulating in North America, or were introduced from Asia via imported rescue dogs as with the previous outbreak. - Mod.JH
