An extremely rare and terrifying condition that only affects infants has been confirmed in East Texas. KLTV is reporting that doctors at the Children's Hospital in Dallas have confirmed that a mother's 4 month old baby was suffering from infant botulism.

The 1st sign was when the infant wasn't eating as well as he should have been. He then started sleeping much more than usual and was lethargic in the small amount of time he was awake. After doctors in Jacksonville couldn't figure out what was wrong, the choice was made to head to Dallas. The condition is rare: only 100 babies a year contract it, and the supply of the only treatment was in California. Thankfully, it was flown out immediately and given to the infant in time. He has made a full recovery.

If you are a parent, you likely remember your doctor telling you not to give your newborn honey before their 1st birthday. That's because honey could contain spores of _Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium responsible for this condition. Older children and adults have the ability to prevent spores from germinating, but infants may not. The bacteria reproduce in the intestines and produce a toxin that interferes with the infant's ability to move, eat, and -- in the most extreme cases -- breathe.

Unfortunately, honey is not the only way this illness can be contracted. Doctors have not yet determined where the infant came into contact with the spores. The good news is that this condition is completely treatable, and, in most cases, a 100% recovery is expected with proper treatment. That's why parents need to be aware of the warning signs.

Kidshealth.org says that infants under the age of one are at risk, but the highest danger is for those between 3 weeks and 6 months old. The symptoms usually start to show within 3-30 days after the spores are ingested. Be on the look-out for the following signs:

- flat facial expression
- poor feeding (weak sucking)
- weak cry
- decreased movement
- trouble swallowing with excessive drooling
- muscle weakness
- breathing problems

If you suspect your child may be suffering from this dangerous condition, see your doctor right away.

[Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, but most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breastfed infants can develop this entity.

The following is extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on infant botulism in New York City [ProMED-mail: Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144]:

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. [This form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG-IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below. - Mod.LL
