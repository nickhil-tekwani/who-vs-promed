The major issue in monitoring of sewage for human pathogens is that in most
cases (even for some classical bacterial agents, such as _Salmonella_ or
_Shigella_) the concentration is quite low (talking about organisms per
liter, or per 10 or 100 liters in some instances. Therefore, the limitation
is often the ability to concentrate the agent of interest from the complex
mixture that sewage is (with a lot of interfering particulate and organic
material). In addition, this must be done in a manner by which one does not
lose a significant amount of the target organism, with some degree of
reproducibility, and also (especially if one is using modern, e.g. PCR,
genetic methods) with some attention to not concentrating potential
interfering agents. This is a tall order, and not easily accomplished.
Finally, I would point out that some agents (such as pathogenic protozoa)
may have substantial non-human reservoirs that also contribute to the
sewage loading (such as via urban street drainage containing pet and other
animal feces).
