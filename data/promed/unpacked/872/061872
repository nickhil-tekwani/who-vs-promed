[Los Santos province in Panama is endemic for Choclo hantavirus, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS] occur there with some frequency. The case numbers have continued to climb this year (2014) from 47 cases (25 with HPS) as of 29 Aug 2014, to 64 cases currently. Although the hantavirus involved in these cases is not specified, the one most likely responsible is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, and can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to the hospital late in the course of their disease. No specific ecological details are provided concerning the environment where these 3 newest patients may have acquired their infections.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
