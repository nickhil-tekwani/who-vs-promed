Ebola outbreak in Equateur province, DRC: 112 cases, 48 deaths

In a follow-up on the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Equateur Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), officials report the outbreak continues to spread in the province.

As of 4 Sep 2020, 112 cases (106 confirmed and 6 probable) and 48 deaths (42 confirmed and 6 probable) have been reported. 50 people have recovered.

The 2 latest cases were reported on Fri 4 Sep 2020 in the health zones of Lotumbe and Bomongo. The Bomongo health zone is the 12th affected since the start of the epidemic in Equateur province.

[This is an increase of 2 cases from 3 Sep 2020 [See CIDRAP report below] to 5 Sep 2020. This is the same rate at which cases have been increasing since early June 2020. Although a slow increase, the virus is expanding its geographic distribution to 12 health zones as of this report, a major concern. - Mod.LK]

Ebola sickens 1 more in DRC outbreak, 110 total, 47 fatal [see above, now 112, 48 fatal]

One more Ebola case has been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Equateur province outbreak, lifting the overall total to 110, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said in a Twitter update today [3 Sep 2020].

No new deaths have been reported, keeping the outbreak's fatality count at 47.

The outbreak, the 11th involving Ebola in the DRC, was 1st detected in early June 2020 and is occurring in the same area in the country's northwest region as a similar outbreak in 2018, which led to 54 cases, 33 of them fatal. Investigations suggest that the new outbreak likely reflects a new jump from animals to people and doesn't seem related to the earlier outbreak or a recent large outbreak in the eastern DRC.

[2] Impact on maternal health care

Abstract

Introduction
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, affecting Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2014 to 2016, was a substantial public health crisis with health impacts extending past EVD itself. Access to maternal health services (MHS) was disrupted during the epidemic, with reductions in antenatal care, facility-based deliveries and postnatal care. We aimed to identify and describe barriers related to the uptake and provision of MHS during the 2014-2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa.

Methods
In June 2020, we conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed publications and grey literature from relevant stakeholder organisations. Search terms were generated to identify literature that explained underlying access barriers to MHS. Published literature in scientific journals was 1st searched and extracted from PubMed and Web of Science databases for the period between 1 Jan 2014 and 27 Jun 2020. We hand-searched relevant stakeholder websites. A "snowball" approach was used to identify relevant sources uncaptured in the systematic search. The identified literature was examined to synthesise themes using an existing framework.

Results
19 papers were included, with 26 barriers to MHS uptake and provision identified. Three themes emerged: (1) fear and mistrust, (2) health system and service constraints, and (3) poor communication. Our analysis of the literature indicates that fear, experienced by both service users and providers, was the most recurring barrier to MHS. Constrained health systems negatively impacted MHS on the supply side. Poor communication and inadequately coordinated training efforts disallowed competent provision of MHS.

Conclusions
Barriers to accessing MHS during the EVD outbreak in West Africa were influenced by complex but inter-related factors at the individual, interpersonal, health system and international level. Future responses to EVD outbreaks need to address underlying reasons for fear and mistrust between patients and providers and ensure MHS are adequately equipped both routinely and during crises.

[Similar disruptions in maternal health care are likely to be associated with COVID-19 as well for the same reasons as those found to affect maternal care during the West African Ebola outbreak, specifically fear and poor communication. This should serve as a lesson for health care facilities to try to address these issues to improve the situation. - Mod.LK
