Eastern equine encephalitis virus activity in North Carolina
------------------------------------------------------------
[On 11 Jul ProMED-mail reported a suspected case of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) virus infection in North Carolina. This new report in
"The Virginia Pilot" reveals that the provisional diagnosis of EEE virus
infection in that case was incorrect. However, another suspected case of
EEE virus infection appears to have been confirmed, indicating that this
year's EEE virus activity in North Carolina may have spread to the human
population. -Mods. MPP/CP
New test results now show that a Kill Devil Hills woman did not die of the
mosquito-borne illness eastern equine encephalitis but from a
noncommunicable condition. [The patient, a 48 year old woman, died on 7
Jul 2000 and was diagnosed with the disease a couple of days later,
prompting an aggressive mosquito-control effort on the Outer Banks.
"We know [now that eastern equine encephalitis [virus did not cause her
death," said Dare County Health Director, Anne Thomas. "A lab test that had
been carried out when she was in hospital confirmed that she had another
condition, and that test takes a long time."
Thomas would not give any details about the condition now attributed to be
responsible for [the woman's death, except to say that it is not
communicable. Two tests, one by a Virginia state lab and another by a
private lab, had given positive results for eastern equine encephalitis
virus, Thomas said. But subsequently a test carried out at the federal
Centers for Disease Control established that [the woman had died of
another condition. Thomas would not comment on the possible reasons that
the test results were inconsistent. "I don't think it says anything about
the state lab techniques," she said. "I think it says something about the
complexity of the condition." State and federal public health officials
were unavailable for comment late Monday.
Another case of eastern equine encephalitis virus infection, however, was
confirmed in Camden County on 21 Jul. The patient appears to be recovering,
according to a statement from North Carolina health officials. The case in
Camden is not likely to be found as anything else, Thomas said. "That has
been confirmed, as I understand, by three different tests," she said. Since
1963, the CDC [have reported 163 cases of eastern equine encephalitis in
the eastern United States.
Chickens in Bladen and Craven counties also have tested positive for the
virus, and a Craven County emu died of the condition on 19 Jul. In Hampton
Roads, 6 horses died in the past two weeks from what is feared to be
eastern equine encephalitis. Tissue samples from the horses -- 3 from
Suffolk, 3 from Chesapeake [all in Virginia -- were sent on Friday to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture's national laboratory in Ames, Iowa. The
results from those tests are expected back today, said Dr. Bruce Akey,
chief of the office of laboratory services with the state Department of
Agriculture. Scott Sawyer, mosquito-control coordinator for Dare County,
said he had not yet decided whether to change the county's current
mosquito-spraying practices. "At this point, spraying is continuing as it
has been done," Thomas said.

[It would be advantageous for everyone involved for the nature of the tests
giving false positive results to be disclosed. Nothing will be gained by
secrecy. Until the situation is clarified, there will be uncertainty about
the accuracy of the diagnosis of the patient in Bladen county. -Mod.CP
