Health authorities in the Los Ríos region confirmed the death of a 25-year-old man in Panguipulli, and clarified the case of another person in Temuco.

The current victim is a suspected case of [a] virus [infection] carried by the long-tailed [pygmy rice] rat, and the finding was corroborated by tests done in the laboratory of the Universidad Austral de Chile, according to the SEREMI [Ministerial Regional Secretariat] Health Administrator, Guillermo Ramírez.

The Public Health and Sanitary Action teams of the Health SEREMI initiated an epidemiological and environmental investigation to determine possible places where the infection occurred -- the type of activity that was being done, and any data accrued that may be relevant in this regard.

This is the 2nd fatal victim so far this year [2016], the 1st having died in Temuco at the beginning of January [2016], who became infected while working in Liquiñe, stated the agency based on its records.

[Much of central and southern Chile, including the Los Lagos region, is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The report above provides little information about the circumstances under which the young man acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
