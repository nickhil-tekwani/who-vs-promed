Kuala Terengganu: Terengganu has been declared free from hemorrhagic
septicemia, a blood-poisoning epidemic in cows and buffaloes. With the end
of the epidemic, livestock movements in the state would proceed as usual,
state Veterinary Services Department director Dr. Ibrahim Che Embong said
yesterday.
Movements of cows and buffaloes were expected to pick up for the Hari Raya
Haji celebrations next month, he said. He said 184 cows and buffaloes worth
more than RM200,000 died when the epidemic was first detected in Kuala
Nerus district on 4 Dec 1999. The last case was reported in Batu Rakit on
31 Jan 2000, he said in an interview.
Ibrahim also said 1,128 cows and buffaloes in Kuala Nerus and 4,511 in Batu
Rakit had been vaccinated against the epidemic. Similar vaccinations had
also been carried out on livestock in Marang, Hulu Terengganu, and Setiu
districts, he added.
