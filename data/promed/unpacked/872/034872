From week 42-52 [of 2013], the syndromic surveillance network reported 6630 suspected Zika [virus infection] cases to the Bureau de Veille Sanitaire. Among them, about 500 cases were tested at the Institute Louis Malarde lab in Papeete for confirmation, and 333 of them were confirmed by RT-PCR as Zika virus infections.

The most frequent clinical symptoms among confirmed cases were rash (95 per cent), asthenia [weakness] (79 per cent), fever (73 per cent), arthralgia [joint pain] (70 per cent) and conjunctivitis (63 per cent). Symptoms are mild and self-limited (mean duration of symptoms between 3-6 days). No hospitalizations for acute infection were reported.

Based on the reported cases, it is estimated that more than 20 000 cases (7.6 per cent of the total population) sought medical assistance with Zika-like symptoms in FrP [French Polynesia] since the beginning of the outbreak. This extrapolation is based only on the number of consultations from the reported cases considering the number of reporting units in the entire territory (so, it is different from the previous figure of 35 000, which was a rough estimation of total cases, consulting or not).

The final estimation of total clinical cases remains unknown because it needs to take into account the proportion of sick people not seeking medical assistance. However, we believe that this proportion of non- consulting people for Zika syndrome is quite high due to mild symptoms and self-limited disease.

All archipelagos and most of the islands of FrP are affected. The epidemic is still increasing over all, in particular in the Leeward Islands and Australes, but seems to be stabilizing in other islands affected earlier.

Between early November [2013] and 6 Jan 2014, 56 cases with neurological or auto-immune complications were reported, including 32 GBS [Guillain-Barre syndrome] cases, 8 cases of encephalitis or meningo-encephalitis (ME), 9 other neurological complications such as paresthesia [tingling or burning sensations], facial paralysis and subdural hematoma [a collection of blood on the surface of the brain], and one case of myelitis [infection or inflammation of the white or gray matter of the spinal cord].

These cases are very unusual, as the 32 GBS cases occurred within only 2 months, compared to the 3 or 4 usual annual cases in FrP. All cases developed the disease after a previous viral infection compatible with Zika syndrome (but not tested initially).

Among the GBS cases, 72 per cent are male. The mean age is 45.8 years (27-70). [Of these], 11 cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 7 cases required mechanical ventilation. No deaths have been reported.

There is still no confirmation that Zika virus is responsible for these cases, but their temporal relationship to the outbreak of Zika and dengue is very suspicious. Detailed investigation is ongoing in French Polynesia.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Mallet for this additional report.

Dr. Mallet has provided the latest case numbers and estimates and clarified some of the points raised in the previous post concerning this outbreak. Although no fatalities or hospitalizations have occurred, given the symptoms among the confirmed cases that Dr. Mallet presents above, this is not a trivial outbreak and doubtless results in lost work days and additional disruptive time required for care-giving at home. The additional cases of GBS are of concern, and one hopes that they resolve without residual effects. Information concerning Zika virus vector mosquito populations on the islands would be of interest.
