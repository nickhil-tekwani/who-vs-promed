Identification of BTV-6 in the Netherlands, October 2008
--------------------------------------------------------
Clinical signs of disease (particularly coronitis) were observed in
small numbers of cattle that had previously been vaccinated against
BTV-8, in the Netherlands during September 2008. Blood samples from
these animals were tested by RT-PCR [reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction] (targeting genome segment 10), for the presence of
bluetongue virus RNA, with positive results. However partial sequence
analyses of Seg-10 showed significant differences when compared to
the northern European outbreak strain of BTV-8 (Maan et al 2008 -
about 95 percent identity in a 200 base pair region) and one of the
samples contained a "mixed sequence." These initial studies at CVI
[Central Veterinary Institute] were subsequently confirmed at IAH
[Institute for Animal Health], indicating that a 'new version' of BTV
genome segment 10 had arrived in the region, something that could
only happen by introduction of a distinct 'new' BTV strain, although
no perfect matches were detected with previously sequenced BTV
isolates.

Initial RT-PCR typing-assays carried out at CVI, using primers
directed against genome segment 2 of the known European BTV serotypes
(types 1, 2, 4, 8, 9 and 16 - see
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/BTV-S2-Primers-Eurotypes.htm>
- Mertens et al 2007) failed to amplify products of the expected
sizes, indicating that the new virus did not belong to any of these
types and provided the 1st indication of a further new serotype in
Europe.

Blood samples from 3 animals [from farms at Barchem (10 Oct 2008).
Luttenberg (16 Oct 2008), and Heeten (17 Oct 2008) in the
Netherlands) as well as one serum sample (Heeten) were sent to the
Community Reference Laboratory and Arbovirus Research Group at IAH
Pirbright. Real time RT-PCR (using the Shaw et al 2007 - assay,
targeting genome segment 1) confirmed a positive identification of
BTV-RNA in all 3 blood samples. However real time RT-PCR assays
targeting genome segment 2 of BTV types 1 and 8 (LSI assay and
unpublished IAH assays), only gave a positive result for BTV-8 in one
blood sample (Luttenberg, which gave the 'mixed Seg-10 sequence')
indicating that the remaining samples (and possibly all 3) contained
a different BTV-serotype (not 1 or 8).

RNA extracted from all 3 blood samples was subsequently tested by
conventional RT-PCR using 2 sets of primers targeting genome segment
2 of each of the 24 established BTV serotypes. Positive results
(bands of the correct sizes) were only detected with the primers
targeting BTV-6, providing the 1st indication that the new virus
belonged to this type. Subsequent assays using additional BTV-6
specific primers gave positive results (bands of the correct sizes)
with a total of 6 primer sets.

The amplified products were sequenced providing data for
approximately 2000 base pairs of genome segment 2. Comparisons to the
Segment 2 database at IAH detected only 5 base changes in this region
when compared to Seg-2 of the reference strain of BTV-6
('RSArrrr/06', held in the BTV reference collection at IAH; details
at
<http://www.reoviridae.org/dsRNA_virus_proteins/ReoID/BTV-6.htm#RSArrrr/06>).
This confirms identification of the virus as BTV-6.

Christiaan Potgieter (Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute/OVI) kindly
provided sequence data for genome segment 2 of the BTV-6 live
attenuated vaccine strain from South Africa, which has a similar
origin to the reference strain. Comparison of Seg-2 from the
Netherlands strain of BTV-6 to this sequence demonstrated only a
single change (greater than 99.9 percent identity). This demonstrated
that (at least genome segment 2 of) the new virus is derived from the
South African vaccine strain of BTV-6.

The BTV 6 SA Reference strain has: 'A' at nucleotide position 54; 'C'
at 384; 'A' at 743; 'G' at 989; and 'A' at 1882.

The BTV 6 NET2008 Heeten strain has: 'A' at nucleotide position 54;
'T' at 384; 'G' at 743; 'A' at 989; and 'G' at 1882.

The BTV 6 OBP live vaccine strain has: 'G' at nucleotide position 54;
'T' at 384; 'G' at 743; 'A' at 989; and 'G' at 1882.

The new virus (from Heeten) was isolated by the CRL [Community
Reference Laboratory] using _Culicoides sonorensis_ (KC) cells and is
now stored in the IAH reference collection as 'NET2008/04'.
Conventional RT-PCR assays gave very strong positive bands with
extracted RNA from this isolate, using 3 sets of primers directed
against Seg-2 of BTV-6.

All 3 blood samples from different locations in the Netherlands gave
positive RT-PCR results using primers for type 6, however one sample
(Luttenberg) also gave a positive result for BTV-8, indicating that
this animal had been infected with both BTV serotypes, potentially
giving an opportunity for these viruses to exchange genome segments
(reassort).

The antisera from the animal at Heeten, was tested by the CRL using
virus neutralisation tests (VNT) against all 24 BTV serotypes, and
gave high neutralisation titres against BTV-6 and BTV-8, (in each
case at a titre of 1/1280), significantly lower titres (1/80 [BTV-14]
to 1/120 [BTV-18]) were detected against 2 other types, although
these results are consistent with sequential infection by BTV-6 and
either infection by or vaccination against BTV-8.

Conclusions
-----------
BTV-6 has now been positively identified in the Netherlands (October
2008). The distance between the affected farms is around 50 km (31
mi), suggesting that if it originated from a single point
introduction, some transmission and spread of the virus had already
occurred, although it is uncertain how long the virus has been
circulating in the region.

BTV-6 is a new serotype to Europe, and although its route of entry is
unknown, its genome segment 2 is clearly derived from the South
African vaccine strain of BTV-6. The only places that we are aware
that the BTV-6 vaccine has been used are in Israel and South Africa
itself. In each case, it was used as part of a multivalent vaccine.
In Israel this involved BTV 2,4,6,10 and 16, while in South Africa
the 'Bottle-A' vaccine contains BTV-1, 4, 6, 12 and 14. [The
inclusion of BTV-16 in the live multivalent vaccine prepared for
Israel by OBP was discontinued -- for safety reasons -- since 2004.
Since 2006, the purchase of the quadrivalent live OBP vaccine BTV
2,4,6,10 by Israel has been discontinued for administrative reasons,
replaced by a commercial inactivated bivalent vaccine BTV 2, 4. The
BTV vaccine is used in Israel on a limited scale exclusively for the
vaccination of sheep of susceptible European mutton breeds. During
2007, 2957 sheep have been vaccinated. - Mod.AS]

It has been suggested that the virus could have arrived in the region
as the result of illegal use of live attenuated BTV vaccines, and
Bottle-A of the south African BTV vaccine, does contain BTV-1, a
strain of current concern in many regions of Europe. However, the
absence of antibodies to multiple other serotypes in the antiserum
from Heeten indicates that this animal at least had not received
either of the multivalent vaccine preparations that are known to have
been generated by OBP in South Africa.

We are currently sequencing the entire genome of the new virus strain
to see if it is completely similar to the live vaccine strain or if
it is a reassortant containing genome segments from other strains.
This might provide additional indications concerning its origins and
movement (as with the BTV-16 strain from Italy 2002 - Batten et al
2008)

[We are most indebted to Prof Mertens and his colleagues at the IAH,
Pirbright, at Lelystad (the Netherlands), and at Onderstepoort (South
Africa) for the detailed report above and the comprehensive
assessment of the situation. The virology is excellent and the
conclusions are carefully worded.

It will be critical to learn what the complete sequencing of genome
of this new outbreak strain reveals; that is, whether there is a
complete match with the vaccine strain or whether it contains genome
subunits from another strain. If it turns out to be a reassortant
this will suggest that the strain has been present for some time
undetected, and the identity of any non-BTV-6 subunits may allow
tracking of the origin of this strain.

According to the official notification of the Dutch authorities to
the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health), this outbreak started
on 10 Sep 2008. - Mods.AS/CP]
