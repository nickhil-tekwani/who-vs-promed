Cases of 5th disease -- a mild rash illness that most commonly affects children but in rare cases can cause expectant mothers to lose the fetus -- are on the rise in Tokyo and expected to worsen, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government. "The number of patients is the highest since we started tracking data in 1997," said Hirofumi Yaguchi, an official with the city's Infectious Disease Control Department.

More than 400 active cases have been reported by Tokyo medical institutions as of 28 Jun [2015], according to the latest data released by the city government. That's up from 331 on 21 Jun [2015]. Most patients have been 6 years old or younger. "The epidemic shows no sign to end at this time," Yaguchi said.

Pediatricians with 374th Medical Group at Yokota Air Base in western Tokyo say they have seen only one or 2 cases over the past couple of months. However, infections have been reported in communities near the base and Tama Hills Recreation Area: Tama Tachikawa, Hachioji City, Minami Tama and Tama Fuchu. Nerima, Arakawa, Taito and Adachi wards have also been affected.

Initial symptoms of 5th disease, also called "slapped-cheek rash" [or syndrome] and "apple disease" in Japan, include fever, runny nose and headache, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After several days, a rash with a rosy appearance can develop on the cheeks, and a meshlike rash can appear on the chest, back, buttocks, or arms and legs. The rash, which may be itchy and can vary in intensity, usually goes away within 7-10 days but can come and go for several weeks.

Older children and adults with 5th disease often develop pain or swelling in their joints, and the government is urging those infected to avoid contact with pregnant women because, in rare cases, it can attack the placenta and cause the loss of the baby.

To prevent further spread of the virus, which is transmitted through respiratory secretions, the government is urging people to practice good hygiene, including handwashing, gargling and covering up when coughing or sneezing.

Other than relieving symptoms, there is no treatment for 5th disease, which got its name because it was once the 5th commonest rash diagnosed by doctors [I thought it was because the rash occurred on the cheeks, in the distribution of the 5th cranial nerve. - Mod.SH]. No vaccine or medicine can prevent the infection, CDC said.

[This is the 1st report of 5th disease (parvovirus B19 infection) in Japan that ProMED-mail has posted. The ProMED-mail post of 19 Jul 2013 (archive no. 20130719.1834968) states, "Accurate diagnosis on a clinical basis can be difficult, however, and parvovirus B19 infection cannot be clearly differentiated from other infections such as rubella. Infection in the 1st 20 weeks of pregnancy is associated with increased risk of intrauterine death and hydrops fetalis. In most individuals infection presents as a mild febrile illness, whilst in patients with increased red blood cell turnover (that is, underlying haemolytic haemoglobulinopathies such as sickle cell disease) infection can lead to transient aplastic crisis, and in patients who are immunocompromised infection may lead to pure red cell aplasia and chronic anaemia. Both these groups of patients have high level viraemia and should be considered infectious. For these reasons, the current increased parvovirus B19 activity in [Japan] warrants increased vigilance by clinicians and awareness of relevant available guidance on diagnosis and management of the infection especially in hospitalised patients."
