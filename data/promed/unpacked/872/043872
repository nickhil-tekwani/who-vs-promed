The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 5 Nov 2018:
- A total of 305 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, including 270 confirmed and 35 probable.
- Of the 270 confirmed, 154 died and 88 are cured. The others are hospitalized in the different Ebola treatment centers (ETCs) installed.
- 60 suspected cases under investigation.
- 5 new confirmed cases, including 1 in Beni, 1 in Butembo, and 3 in Kalunguta.
- 3 new confirmed fatalities, including 1 in Beni, 1 in Butembo, and 1 in Mabalako.

News of the response
Epidemiological surveillance
----------------------------
- Several cases of Ebola have been identified in a Mayi-Mayi [Mai-Mai] village in the Kalunguta health zone [North Kivu], located in a red zone, following the escape of a confirmed case of Beni [North Kivu] to this village in order to escape the teams of the response. After negotiations with the village leaders, an investigative mission was organized to examine the people who are currently ill and to investigate the deaths that occurred in the village the previous weeks. This investigation will identify deaths caused by Ebola and classify them, if any, as probable cases. So far, villagers have been cooperative and vaccination has begun.
- Among the new confirmed cases in Kalunguta, there is a 6-day newborn baby from a confirmed case who died on 4 Nov 2018 at Butembo ETC [North Kivu]. The child's mother began to show symptoms of the disease 5 days before giving birth to her son.

Vaccination
-----------
- Since the start of vaccination on 8 Aug 2018, 26 724 people have been vaccinated, including 14 160 in Beni [North Kivu], 4436 in Mabalako [North Kivu], 2152 in Katwa [North Kivu], 1663 in Mandima [Ituri], 1435 in Butembo [North Kivu], 690 in Masereka [North Kivu], 507 in Kalunguta [North Kivu], 434 in Bunia [Ituri], 355 in Tchomia [Ituri], 240 in Komanda [Ituri], 184 in Mutwanga [North Kivu], 178 in Oicha [North Kivu], 160 in Musienene [North Kivu], and 130 in Vuhovi [North Kivu].

1. BAD news: Today's [6 Nov 2018] #Ebola update from @MinSanteRDC reports that new cases at Kalunguta [North Kivu] are in Mai-Mai controlled territory, a red (that is, no-go) zone. Of today's 5 new cases, 3 are from Kalunguta. Fortunately the response team has negotiated access & is assessing the situation.

2. 3 #Ebola deaths were also reported today [6 Nov 2018]. One of the deaths was a 6-day-old baby whose mother is also infected. Today's cases & deaths bring the North Kivu totals to 305 confirmed & probable cases & 189 deaths. The other cases today were at Beni & Butembo.

3. As of today [6 Nov 2018], 48% of all the cases in this #Ebola outbreak have been reported since [1 Oct 2018]. That's an outbreak that's growing, not one that is coming under control. Buckle up.]

[2] Fear of armed attack: first-hand report
Date: Tue 6 Nov 2018 12:52 GMT
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/nov/06/doctor-fear-of-armed-attack-ebola-patients-congo-drc


Background: We're in constant fear of armed attack as we treat Ebola patients in Congo.

As a doctor in DRC, I know the harsh reality of attempting to fight an epidemic on the frontline of a conflict zone.

I have been responding to different disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for 18 years, yet I have never seen anything as challenging as containing Ebola in an armed-conflict zone.

DRC is facing its 10th Ebola outbreak, but this epidemic, which broke out in August [2018], is the country's first in an area where fighting is ongoing. Since 2014, about 2000 people have been killed in clashes between armed groups.

I'm a doctor stationed in Beni, in the northeastern province of North Kivu. It's the epicentre of the current Ebola outbreak. Here, any aid worker, especially us locals, can be in imminent danger. Active shooting is common. A few weeks ago, a vehicle of humanitarian staff moving an Ebola patient's dead body to be buried was attacked and passengers were injured.

I cannot access entire villages. Not because of the unequipped terrain and unpaved dirt roads but because these villages act as frontlines between the different armed groups.

Ebola is a fatal disease. Because it is a viral infection, it does not have an effective cure. People here in Beni have never encountered Ebola and in many cases have never even heard of it. There is strong resistance from people to accept the existence of the disease and cooperate with people like me working to eliminate it.

Recent reports have said the epidemic has been controlled. This is not true. We still have new confirmed cases, almost on a daily basis. To confirm an Ebola epidemic is under control we need to wait for at least 6 weeks after the last confirmed case, which involves inspecting all the direct contacts of every infected person, and ensuring that during that period we have not had a single new case.

Despite communities' resistance, people are becoming aware of the disease and its danger. But even the most basic ways to counter it are almost impossible to implement in some inaccessible villages. These include installing handwashing stations and refilling them, conducting awareness-raising sessions, or doing some basic distributions of much-needed items such as soap, buckets, and hand sanitizers. In some areas we cannot confirm if the symptoms and even deaths occurring are due to Ebola. This is why we have some "probable" cases.

One of the biggest challenges is providing direct help to infected people, while ensuring caregivers do not get infected. When you walk around the city and visit response sites and clinics, no one shakes hands. When we want to greet each other, we do it through touching elbows, to avoid any possibility of spreading the virus, which is only transmitted through direct contact of body fluids.

At every location there is at least one water cooler and everyone is obliged to wash their hands. You can smell the chlorine on your hands for hours afterwards, but this is a mandatory precaution to ensure no aid workers, especially health staff, get infected, as this will risk losing the trust of local communities.

The basic health precautions we promote to eliminate Ebola are the same standards that should be applied all the time, with or without an epidemic. Sadly, this outbreak has revealed a gap there, which could be due to lack of awareness, or lack of tools and infrastructure. To be better able to protect communities from epidemics, some basic services need to be enhanced. In Beni, for example, water networks do not reach everywhere, and schools do not have enough bathrooms.

In schools, awareness-raising campaigns are carried out, and they are provided with handwashing stations and thermometers. Similarly, we make sure clinics are well-equipped and completely clean from the virus, by providing handwashing facilities, gloves, and the necessary training to volunteers and paramedics. If it is possible to prevent the infection of all the staff and volunteers responding to the epidemic, then it must be possible to eliminate Ebola completely.

[First-hand accounts are always valuable to read since we learn directly from the person on the ground. It is difficult to picture the experience of working with people infected with such a virulent virus as Ebola, in an environment with armed militants and community resistance and fear, where 2000 people have died in conflict since 2014. It must indeed be stressful. We who are far from the DRC can only respect the work the healthcare workers are doing and support the effort to stop the outbreak in whatever way we can. - Mod.LK]

[3] Summary

DRC reports 3 Ebola cases in high-risk village, 2 others
--------------------------------------------------------
The number of Ebola cases confirmed in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) grew by 5 today, including 3 from a security red zone in Kalunguta health zone [North Kivu], the country's health ministry said today [6 Nov 2018] in its daily update.

Meanwhile, high-level talks are under way between global health officials in the DRC to see what more can be done to shore up the security situation in the outbreak zone and what other resources the country needs to battle the virus.

More illnesses, deaths probed in Kalunguta
------------------------------------------
The DRC's health ministry said several Ebola infections have been identified in a Mayi-Mayi village in Kalunguta health zone [North Kivu] , located in a red zone, following the escape of a patient from Beni [North Kivu] who fled to the village to evade response teams.

On [23 Sep 2018] the health ministry had said that a patient from Beni had escaped from a treatment center in Beni and was found in an unsecured part of Kalunguta health zone, but it's unclear if that patient is the one linked to the spurt of new cases from the area. Overall, 6 cases have been reported in Kalunguta health zone, including one reported yesterday [5 Nov 2018].

Since the outbreak began in the conflict-ridden part of the DRC, health officials have continually warned of the risk of the disease circulating undetected in insecure areas where it's difficult and dangerous for responders to identify cases, trace contacts, and get people vaccinated. Outbreak responders negotiated with village leaders to organize an investigation mission to examine people who are sick and probe deaths that have occurred in the previous weeks, the health ministry said. "So far, villagers have been cooperative, and vaccination has begun." According to today's update, 507 people in Kalunguta have been vaccinated.

One of the new cases in Kalunguta involves a 6-day-old baby boy of an infected mother who died on [4 Nov 2018] at an Ebola treatment center in Butembo. The mother's symptoms began 5 days before her son was born.

The other new cases reported today are in Beni and Butembo. 3 new deaths reported involve people from Beni, Butembo, and Mabalako [North Kivu]. The new developments push the outbreak total to 305, which includes 270 confirmed and 35 probable cases. The death total has now reached 189.

Health officials are still investigating 60 suspected Ebola infections in the region.

WHO, UN officials visit Goma today [6 Nov 2018]
-----------------------------------------------
A delegation from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN) are in the DRC this week to assess the country's needs in battling the outbreak and securing the affected areas. The group includes WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus PhD, Peter Salama MD, the WHO's director-general for emergency preparedness, and Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the under-secretary-general for the UN peacekeeping forces.

According to the WHO, the group is expected to visit Beni [North Kivu] tomorrow [7 Nov 2018] and will be in the DRC until [Thu 8 Nov 2018].

On Twitter today [6 Nov 2018], Lacroix said the group met with North Kivu province's governor in Goma today. He also tweeted, "The health workers in the Ebola affected zone do crucial work amidst a difficult security environment. They need our full support." Lacroix added that MONUSCO, the UN peacekeeping mission in the DRC, is actively supporting the DRC's government to improve security. He added that the health and safety of North Kivu's civilians is the group's greatest priority.
