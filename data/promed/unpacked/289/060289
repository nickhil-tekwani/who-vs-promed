Recently, a 16-year-old girl was admitted to Xi'an Children's Hospital due to sudden haemorrhagic fever. She was in the intensive care unit for a week because of her serious condition before she got better.

The girl (ZZ) ate out on the day of the incident. She ate 3 steamed buns and a bowl of rice noodles. She developed fever after returning home. The fever reached 39 C [102 F]. The family rushed her to the county hospital, and then she was transferred to Xi'an Children's Hospital.

According to the infectious disease doctor of Xi'an Children's Hospital, the girl had a fever when she arrived and was diagnosed with hemorrhagic fever in the early stage. She also had pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and abdominal effusion. Her condition was relatively serious, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit for treatment. Later, her condition steadily improved, and she was transferred to the general ward.

Epidemic hemorrhagic fever, also known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, is a natural focal disease caused by a hantavirus transmitted by rodents. The disease is widespread. It has a high fatality rate and is extremely harmful. Eating food and water contaminated by rat excrement containing hemorrhagic fever virus, being bitten by a rat, rat excrement exposure/direct contact with damaged skin and mucous membranes may all lead to infection with hemorrhagic fever virus.

"Chang'an, Zhouzhi, Huyi, and Xingping are all areas with a high incidence of hemorrhagic fever. You must pay attention to food hygiene and beware of food contamination by rodents," the doctor said.

The Shaanxi Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that October to March is the season for haemorrhagic fever in Guanzhong area of our province. The incidence is high among farmers and students, who often have field work or activities. Vaccination is the main means of preventing and controlling hemorrhagic fever.

Strengthen personal protection and develop good hygiene habits. Try to avoid contact with rodents and their excreta, and do not stay overnight in outdoor places such as orchards to prevent mites from biting [mites suggest scrub typhus, not hantavirus infection. - Mod.TY]; in key places such as villages, orchards, vegetable gardens, and farms, long-term rodent control and rodent prevention measures can be implemented; do not eat cold food, especially food and water contaminated by rodents; when cleaning messy debris and waste (such as straw, corn stalks, etc.), wear masks, hats, and gloves. Once symptoms such as fever, muscle soreness, and bleeding on the skin appear, go to the hospital in time.

The main signs of hemorrhagic fever are headache; orbital pain; low back pain; face, neck, and chest congestion and flushing; congestion; and bleeding (conjunctiva and oral cavity congestion, bleeding, and axillary skin or clusters of bleeding spots).

The early symptoms of epidemic hemorrhagic fever are similar to a cold, and the 2 are not easy to distinguish. Therefore, most people mistakenly think it is a common cold and are not actively diagnosed and treated. But the systemic symptoms of epidemic hemorrhagic fever continue to aggravate after the body temperature returns to normal, and even hypotension and shock may occur. Therefore, when the above symptoms occur, seek medical treatment in time to avoid missing the best treatment opportunity.

[The specific hantavirus involved in this case is not stated. In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in _Rattus norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in China. A bunyavirus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus, is unlikely, as during the winter season, ticks, the vectors of this virus, will not be active.

Hantaan virus has several (up to 5 have been reported) subtypes and is transmitted by the field mouse _Apodemus agrarius_, whereas Seoul virus is less variable and is transmitted by the rat _Rattus norvegicus_. A 3rd hantavirus that causes HFRS, Muju virus, has been reported from the Korean peninsula.
