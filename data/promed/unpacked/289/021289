[1] UK: Astra Zeneca "antibody cocktail" trial

AstraZeneca has started late-stage trials of an experimental long-acting monoclonal antibody combination drug it hopes could be used as a so-called prophylactic to prevent COVID-19 infection in at-risk people for up to 12 months.

The phase 3 international clinical trial will recruit a total of 5000 people across countries in Europe and the United States to assess the safety and effectiveness of the antibody cocktail, known as AZD7442. The prophylactic treatment differs from a vaccine in that it introduces antibodies, rather than prompting the body's immune system to make them. It may prove useful in people whose immune systems are weaker or compromised, and who don't respond to vaccination. Separately, AstraZeneca is developing a COVID-19 vaccine in conjunction with researchers at Oxford University.

In Britain, where the trials of the monoclonal antibody combination kicked off on Saturday [21 Nov 2020], 1000 participants will be recruited at 9 sites, researchers leading the UK arm said. "What we are investigating in this study is whether we can provide protection by giving antibodies that have been shown to neutralize the virus, by injection into the muscle," said Andrew Ustianowski, a professor and chief investigator on the UK study. "The hope is that this will then provide good protection for many months against infection."

Monoclonal antibodies mimic natural antibodies that the body generates to fight off infection. They can be synthesized in the laboratory and are already used to treat some types of cancer. AstraZeneca said its COVID-19 cocktail -- which combines 2 monoclonal antibodies -- has the potential both to treat and prevent disease progression in patients already infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and to be given as a preventative medication prior to people such as health-care workers being exposed to the virus.

"These have been engineered specifically to have what we call a long half-life, (so) we think they will confer protection for (at least) 6, but more likely closer to 12 months," Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, told reporters at a briefing. He said this made the cocktail, "in effect, almost like a passive vaccination."

Alongside the 5000-participant trial assessing the drug's potential as a preventative, AstraZeneca also plans to evaluate AZD7442 as a post-exposure preventative and pre-emptive treatment in roughly 1100 participants in trials in Europe and the United States.

[The use of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) for treatment or prevention of infectious diseases is relatively new. Their use in treatment of malignancies and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases has been well studied. In recent times, a monoclonal antibody has been used as a prophylactic against respiratory syncytial virus in high risk infants. Marston, Paules, and Fauci (ref 1) make a good case for 3 uses of mAbs in emerging infectious diseases: treatment of infected individuals (note the use of the Regeneron mAbs and the Lilly mAb); targeted prophylaxis to protect high-risk individuals (the focus of the Astra Zeneca study); and targeted prophylaxis to interrupt transmission in average-risk populations (if successful in the stage 3 trial, this "antibody cocktail" may be used the way IgG was used to prevent against hepatitis A in travelers to high risk areas for hepatitis A virus circulation). They also mention its potential use for Zika prevention in pregnant women. Walker and Burton (ref 2) make a similar argument, referring to these mAbs as "super antibodies" with a focus on broadly neutralizing antibodies and their potential for use in disease prevention -- especially in the absence of vaccine. They mention studies underway for use of mAbs against MERS-CoV, HIV, Ebola virus (ZMapp), Zika virus, chikungunya virus, and influenza virus. The pandemic SARS-CoV-2 is providing the venue for further development and application of this technology for use in emerging infectious diseases.

[2] Brazil: Yanomami indigenous reservation
Date: Fri 20 Nov 2020

The coronavirus has spread rapidly through the Yanomami indigenous reservation in northern Brazil and more than 1/3 of its 27 000 people could have been exposed, according to a report produced by their leaders.

The Yanomami's territory, which is also home to 600 Ye'kwana people, is the largest indigenous reservation in Brazil. It is threatened by swarms of illegal gold miners who have invaded their lands bordering Venezuela and are thought to be a major contagion risk. Confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the reservation have risen some 260% between August and October [2020], said the report, released on Thursday [19 Nov 2020] by the Yanomami and Ye'kwana Leadership Forum.

So far, there have been 1202 confirmed cases and 23 deaths, the report said. The data was gathered from the indigenous health service and a survey by radio communication with the 366 villages, some of them still very isolated, across the 96 650 square kilometers [about 37 300 sq mi] of reservation. The report said only 4.7% of the reservation's population had been tested for COVID-19 and 70% of those tested were positive, but no tests had been done in 1/3 of the villages.

"Every day more and more Yanomami are being exposed to infection by the virus," Dario Kopenawa, vice president of the Hutukara Yanomami Association and son of its main shaman Davi Kopenawa, told Reuters by telephone. "There are health professionals working here, but too few and they have no equipment," he said.

In July [2020], a military mission visited a remote part of the reservation in helicopters, bringing protective equipment and medical supplies. But its arrival with a group of journalists annoyed Yanomami leaders who saw it as an unannounced media show that undermined the tribe's efforts to remain isolated from contagion.

[ProMED-mail covered the initial introductions of the SARS-CoV-2 in the South American indigenous populations (COVID-19 update (348): Japan genomics, Americas indigenous, WHO, global 20200807.7653452, COVID-19 update (193): global, China, CFRs, Amazon Indigenous pop, WHO 20200519.7352326, and COVID-19 update (332): Amazon, USA, selected countries, WHO, global 20200726.7612704) when investigative reporting identified the failures in reaching these populations with healthcare services. It is saddening to read that the situation has not improved over the ensuing months.

Borrowing from my moderator comment in 20200807.7653452, "A fairly consistent theme throughout the Americas is the high population-based incident of morbidity and mortality due to infection with the SARS-CoV-2 in the indigenous populations. Much of these populations live in relatively remote areas with difficult access to limited health services and live in fairly crowded groupings where social distancing is challenging to say the least. Poverty is a common denominator and income generation is dependent upon close contact mostly in markets selling wares."

While they are a small fraction of the country's population, they deserve access to good healthcare, both preventive as well as curative. Indigenous populations globally have been disproportionately affected by this pandemic, income generation has required close contact with the general population, and access to health services has been suboptimal, in many cases not unrelated to living in more remote locations. The pandemic highlights inequities. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 22 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov22_1606086691.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 44.7% of daily case numbers and 41.3% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 24.5 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Canada, and Peru. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile, Panama, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Ecuador. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, and Paraguay.

- The European region reported 38.5% of daily case numbers and 40.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 16.8 million. Countries not reporting cases today (22 Nov 2020) include Spain, Israel, Switzerland, Sweden, and Norway, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Italy, Russia, Poland, UK, France, Germany, and Ukraine. 22 additional countries are reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.5% of daily case numbers and 8.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.79 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Morocco, Jordan, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, the UAE, and Tunisia. Oman, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 1.6% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.44 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Kenya, Algeria, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Ghana, Uganda, Angola, and Mozambique.

- The Western Pacific region reported 0.96% of daily case numbers and 0.78% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.83 million cases. Japan is dominant, followed by Philippines, Malaysia, South Korea, China, Guam, and Mongolia.

- The South East Asia region reported 9.2% of the daily newly reported cases and 7.2% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.3 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. With major countries in Europe not reporting over the weekend, European countries are still experiencing significant levels of transmission. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 22 Nov 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Costa Rica, among others in keeping with the "weekend artifact" observed regularly. In addition, countries that are reporting have decreased the numbers of 24 hour case and death reports significantly over the weekend. The number of countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours has dropped from 63 on Friday (20 Nov 2020) to 56 today (22 Nov 2020). In the past 24 hours, the USA (137 995), India (44 404), Italy (28 337), and Russia (24 581) have reported the highest numbers of cases, although significantly less than reported yesterday (21 Nov 2020) and Friday (20 Nov 2020). A global total of 7237 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (21-22 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries) include the USA, India, Italy, Russia, UK (18 662), Brazil (18 615), Poland (17 856), Germany (13 840), France (13 157), Iran (13 053), and Ukraine (12 079).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 2.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.1%. In the USA, the comparative 7 day averages show a 13.4% increase in confirmed cases and a 34.7% increase in daily reported deaths.

Impression: Even with the weekend decrease in reporting, the comparative 7 day averages show a weekly increase in reported cases and deaths at the global level, and continued uncontrolled transmission in the USA. - Mod.MPP]
