France. 19 Jan 2017. (conf.) A woman with controlled HIV infection developed in late August 2016 a pruritic rash with fever and conjunctival hyperaemia after a trip to the French Caribbean islands. On day 3 after symptom onset, Zika virus RNA was detected in plasma, urine and vaginal samples with respective viral loads of 3.8, 6.1 and 5.3 log copies/mL. Notably, we demonstrated the presence of infectious Zika virus particles in the vaginal samples by isolation in cell culture.

- Donated blood. 5 Feb 2017. (reported) Of 358 786 donations from US states screened by individual donation testing, 23 were initially reactive on cobas Zika. 14 of these represented probable ZIKV infection based on reactivity on additional nucleic acid testing or anti-Zika immunoglobulin M. 10 of the 14 donors reported travel to an identified ZIKV-active area within 90 days before donation (median time from end of travel to donation, 25 days; range, 6-71 days). 3 donors with travel history also had a potential sexual exposure. Only 7 of the 14 donations with probable ZIKV infection were detectable upon 1:6 dilution to simulate minipool testing. The estimated specificity of the cobas Zika test was 99.997 percent.

Highlighted below is a summary of the epidemiological situation by sub-regions.

North America
In the United States of America, the Florida Department of Health continues to report isolated local transmission cases.

In Mexico, there has been a decreasing trend since EW 39 of 2016 [week ending 30 Sep 2016], with a weekly average of 9 confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks.

Central America
The number of reported cases in Central America remains consistent, with a weekly average of 369 cases, 317 suspected, and 52 confirmed, in the last 4 weeks.

In Panama, the growing trend of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 30 of 2016 to EW 1 of 2017 [23 Jul 2016-6 Jan 2017] was maintained.

Caribbean
In Montserrat, there is an increasing trend in the number of suspected and confirmed cases between EW 49 and EW 51 of 2016 [3-23 Dec 2016].

While other countries and territories in the Caribbean continue to report cases, the trend remains stable, with a weekly average of 651 cases (164 suspected and 487 confirmed) in the last 4 weeks.

South America
In South America, the number of cases reported remains stable with a weekly average of 6601 suspected and confirmed cases in the last 4 weeks, of which 6164 were reported in Brazil.

In Paraguay, the trend of suspected cases increased between EW 42 of 2016 and EW 3 of 2017 [15 Oct 2016-20 Jan 2017].

In Peru, there was an increase in the number of cases reported between EW 1 and EW 3 of 2017 [1-20 Jan 2017]; the increase is related to an outbreak occurring in the department of Loreto.

Congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection
To date, 23 countries and territories in the Americas have reported confirmed cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection. In EW 5 of 2017 [week ending 3 Feb 2017], Mexico reported a confirmed case of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection for the 1st time. In the last 2 weeks, Argentina, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Martinique, and the United States of America, updated their number of cases of congenital syndrome associated with Zika virus infection.

As of 1 Sep 2016, the table with the number of confirmed cases of congenital syndrome is published on a weekly basis on the PAHO/WHO website and is available at http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12390&Itemid=42090

[3] Brain malformations

Ref: Sanz-Cortes M, Zarutskie AJ, Yepez M, et al: Characterization of brain malformations and volume assessment in fetuses with Zika virus infection using MRI. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology; 216(1): S52-53; http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(16)31939-1/fulltext
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Objective
To assess fetal brain findings and volumetric composition with MRI in a prospective cohort of confirmed Zika virus (ZIKV) infected fetuses from the current outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia.

Study design
Between December 2015 and July 2016, 214 pregnant patients with suspected symptomatic ZIKV exposure (and their sexual partner/s) were included. Cases with fetal brain anomalies on ultrasound(US) and confirmed ZIKV (by qRT-PCR) underwent a fetal MRI (1.5 T Phillips Ingenia). In order to create a single 3D volume absent of artifact from inherent motion and intensity corruption, a super-resolution (SR) reconstruction was obtained by co-registering the 3 orthogonal T2 weighted image stacks and iteratively performing voxel-based intensity matching. SR images were post-processed for volumetric analyses by performing manual segmentation. Total Brain Volume (TBV), supratentorial brain parenchyma (SBP), ventricular volume (VV), brainstem volume (BV), cerebellar volume (CV), and total intracranial volume (TICV) (TBV + volume of CSF in the subarachnoid space) were determined.

Results
A total of 13 cases presented with abnormal brain US findings (microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, callosal dysgenesis, calcifications and cortical anomalies). Of those cases that were ZIKV positive 7, underwent a fetal MRI (29.0±4.4 weeks), and were gestational age matched to 7 healthy controls (CTRLS) (29.87±4.61 weeks; p=0.72). ZIKV infected fetuses significantly differed from controls in TBV (ZIKV: 9422.42±2169.11 vs. CTRLS: 20529.7±7049.95; p less than 0.01) and TICV (16390.42±3690.41 vs.35593.42±12281.71; p<0.01). No significant difference was seen in VV (2692.85±540.92 vs. 2967.14±759.74; p=0.45), BV (653.01±211.51 vs. 990.22±369.31; p=0.06) or CV (914.31±414.57 vs. 1416.14±565.85; p=0.08). The CSF/SBP ratio was higher (1.36±0.20 vs. 0.99±0.16; p less than 0.01) in ZIKV affected fetuses, suggesting microencephaly.

Conclusion
In this large cohort of ZIKV infected gravidae, we characterized brain findings using MRI. Microcephaly, callosal dysgenesis, ventriculomegaly and calcifications are common anomalies associated with fetal ZIKV. We observed a significant association between decreased brain volumes (predominantly evidenced by decreased SBP and increased CSF in the subarachnoid space) and ultrasound detected microcephaly.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that is causally linked to severe neonatal birth defects, including microcephaly, and is associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults. Dendritic cells (DCs) are an important cell type during infection by multiple mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, and yellow fever virus. Despite this, the interplay between ZIKV and DCs remains poorly defined. Here, we found human DCs supported productive infection by a contemporary Puerto Rican isolate with considerable variability in viral replication, but not viral binding, between DCs from different donors. Historic isolates from Africa and Asia also infected DCs with distinct viral replication kinetics between strains. African lineage viruses displayed more rapid replication kinetics and infection magnitude as compared to Asian lineage viruses, and uniquely induced cell death. Infection of DCs with both contemporary and historic ZIKV isolates led to minimal up-regulation of T cell co-stimulatory and MHC molecules, along with limited secretion of inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) protein translation was observed during ZIKV infection, despite strong induction at the RNA transcript level and up-regulation of other host antiviral proteins. Treatment of human DCs with RIG-I agonist potently restricted ZIKV replication, while type I IFN had only modest effects. Mechanistically, we found all strains of ZIKV antagonized type I IFN-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2. Combined, our findings show that ZIKV subverts DC immunogenicity during infection, in part through evasion of type I IFN responses, but that the RLR signaling pathway is still capable of inducing an antiviral state, and therefore may serve as an antiviral therapeutic target.

Author summary
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus that, upon congenital infection, can cause severe neonatal birth defects. To better understand the early innate immune response to ZIKV, we compared infection of human dendritic cells (DCs) between a contemporary Puerto Rican isolate and historic isolates from Africa and Asia. Human DCs supported productive replication following infection with the contemporary strain and exhibited donor variability in viral replication, but not viral binding. While contemporary and historic Asian lineage viruses replicated similarly, the African strains displayed more rapid replication kinetics with higher infection magnitude and uniquely induced cell death. Minimal DC activation and antagonism of type I interferon (IFN) translation was observed during ZIKV infection, despite strong induction of IFNB1 transcription and translation of other antiviral effector proteins. Treatment with a RIG-I agonist potently blocked ZIKV replication in human DCs, while type I IFN treatment was significantly less effective. Mechanistically, all ZIKV strains inhibited type I IFN receptor signaling through blockade of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. Altogether, we found that while ZIKV efficiently evades type I IFN responses during infection of human DCs, RIG-I signaling remains capable of inducing a strong antiviral state.

Significance
Zika virus (ZIKV) causes microcephaly, whereas other related pathogenic flaviviruses do not. To reach the fetal brain, a virus must be transported from the maternal to the fetal circulation, which requires crossing of the placental barrier. Our studies demonstrate that mammalian cell-derived ZIKV, but not 2 other globally relevant flaviviruses, efficiently infects fetal endothelial cells, a key component of the placental barrier, because only ZIKV can efficiently use the cell-surface receptor AXL. These data suggest that use of AXL allows ZIKV to enter the fetal bloodstream to gain access to other fetal tissues. Thus, this study provides insight into the unique properties of ZIKV that contribute to its ability to cause microcephaly and other congenital infections and diseases.

Abstract
Although a causal relationship between Zika virus (ZIKV) and microcephaly has been established, it remains unclear why ZIKV, but not other pathogenic flaviviruses, causes congenital defects. Here we show that when viruses are produced in mammalian cells, ZIKV, but not the closely related dengue virus (DENV) or West Nile virus (WNV), can efficiently infect key placental barrier cells that directly contact the fetal bloodstream. We show that AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase, is the primary ZIKV entry cofactor on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and that ZIKV uses AXL with much greater efficiency than does DENV or WNV. Consistent with this observation, only ZIKV, but not WNV or DENV, bound the AXL ligand Gas6. In comparison, when DENV and WNV were produced in insect cells, they also infected HUVECs in an AXL-dependent manner. Our data suggest that ZIKV, when produced from mammalian cells, infects fetal endothelial cells much more efficiently than other pathogenic flaviviruses because it binds Gas6 more avidly, which in turn facilitates its interaction with AXL.

[This study adds to the understand of possible mechanisms that facilitate Zika virus infection of developing fetuses causing microcephaly other birth defects that other flaviviruses do not.

The AXL receptor was shown to be important in anther study published on 17 Jan 2017. In that study, cells expressing high levels of the attachment factor AXL can be protected from infection with receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while placental-derived cells that lack AXL expression are insensitive to this inhibition. They identified nanchangmycin as a potent inhibitor of Zika virus entry across all cell types tested, including physiologically relevant primary cells (http://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(16)31775-2). This report was provided by Roland Hubner.

An 11 Jan 2017 report indicated that colonies of placental lineage cells derived from embryonic stem cells, which are probably analogous to the primitive placenta at implantation, were lysed more rapidly by an African strain of ZIKV, considered relatively benign, than by an Asian strain linked to fetal brain abnormalities. They concluded that the human fetus may be most vulnerable to ZIKV very early in pregnancy and that the African strain may threaten a pregnancy more strongly than previously believed (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/02/08/1616097114.full). - Mod.TY]

[6] Diagnostic test
Date: Tue 4 Feb 2017

Abbott [company] announced [Thu 4 Feb 2017] that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized its molecular test, the Abbott RealTime ZIKA test, to detect Zika virus in whole blood (when collected alongside a patient-matched serum or plasma sample) for emergency use.

This is the 1st molecular test made by a commercial manufacturer authorized to detect Zika in whole blood samples, which is significant since recent research suggests Zika virus can be detected in whole blood for a longer period of time (up to 2 months) and at higher levels versus testing with serum and urine sample types.

"Diagnosing a Zika infection can be challenging, especially since people might not have any symptoms or only have mild symptoms that last a few days," said John Hackett, PhD, divisional vice president, applied research and technology, Diagnostics Products, Abbott. "Abbott's molecular test may provide the ability to identify the active virus over a longer time period with whole blood and could provide a more accurate diagnosis. Our test can also distinguish Zika from other viruses such as dengue or chikungunya, which helps doctors make informed diagnoses to help people get back to better health."

The Abbott RealTime ZIKA test is designed for use on the m2000 RealTime System -- the company's molecular diagnostics instrument used in hospital and reference labs in the US and around the world. Providing results within 5-7 hours, the test is highly sensitive to detect if someone is infected with Zika. It is also automated, allowing people who work in the lab to be more efficient and spend less time preparing and handling samples, reducing the chances of error and increasing speed to diagnosis.

[Because the early symptoms of Zika virus, if there are any, are similar to those of dengue and chikungunya virus infections, a reliable diagnostic test will be useful, especially in the case of pregnant women, their partners and potential blood donors. This report and the one following it are examples of advances being made in the development of diagnostic tests for Zika virus infections. - Mod.TY]

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Background: Currently the detection of Zika virus (ZIKV) in patient samples is done by real-time RT-PCR. Samples collected from rural area are sent to highly equipped laboratories for screening. A rapid point-of-care test is needed to detect the virus, especially at low resource settings.

Methodology/Principal findings: In this report, we describe the development of a reverse transcription isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the identification of ZIKV. RT-RPA assay was portable, sensitive (21 RNA molecules), and rapid (3-15 minutes). No cross-reactivity was detected to other flaviviruses, alphaviruses and arboviruses. Compared to real-time RT-PCR, the diagnostic sensitivity was 92 percent, while the specificity was 100 percent.

Conclusions/significance: The developed assay is a promising platform for rapid point of need detection of ZIKV in low resource settings and elsewhere (e.g. during mass gathering).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Since Zika virus (ZIKV) was detected in Brazil in 2015, it has spread explosively across the Americas and has been linked to increased incidence of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). In one year, it has infected over 500 000 people (suspected and confirmed cases) in 40 countries and territories in the Americas. Along with recent epidemics of dengue (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV), which are also transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_ mosquitoes, the emergence of ZIKV suggests an ongoing intensification of environmental and social factors that have given rise to a new regime of arbovirus transmission. Here, we review hypotheses and preliminary evidence for the environmental and social changes that have fueled the ZIKV epidemic. Potential drivers include climate variation, land use change, poverty, and human movement. Beyond the direct impact of microcephaly and GBS, the ZIKV epidemic will likely have social ramifications for women's health and economic consequences for tourism and beyond.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with human congenital fetal anomalies. To model fetal outcomes in nonhuman primates, we administered Asian-lineage ZIKV subcutaneously to 4 pregnant rhesus macaques. While non-pregnant animals clear viremia within 10-12 days, maternal viremia was prolonged in 3 of 4 pregnancies. Fetal head growth velocity in the last month of gestation determined by ultrasound assessment of head circumference was decreased in comparison with biparietal diameter and femur length within each fetus, both within normal range. ZIKV RNA was detected in tissues from all 4 fetuses at term cesarean section. In all pregnancies, neutrophilic infiltration was present at the maternal-fetal interface (decidua, placenta, fetal membranes), in various fetal tissues, and in fetal retina, choroid, and optic nerve (1st trimester infection only). Consistent vertical transmission in this primate model may provide a platform to assess risk factors and test therapeutic interventions for interruption of fetal infection.
