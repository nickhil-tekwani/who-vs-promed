-----------------------------------------------------------------
Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest): Absent from
Lithuania. Established in Czechia, Hungary (it poses problems both indoor
and outdoor), Netherlands, United Kingdom. Sweden is an EU protected zone
(the virus was found in 1996 but was not seen again). Denmark was an EU
protected zone until 1998-07, but efforts are still being made to exclude
it from plants for planting (as well as impatiens necrotic spot
tospovirus). The virus occurs in Norway but is under eradication. In
Slovakia, it has been reported in a few locations since 1993, infected
plants are destroyed.
