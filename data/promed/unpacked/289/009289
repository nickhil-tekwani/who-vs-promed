Dog owners have been urged to take care when walking their pets after 2 more cases of Alabama rot were confirmed in the UK. The disease has killed 5 dogs since the start of the year [2022] in the country, with the latest cases occurring in Bristol and Kingston, Devon.

Alabama rot -- also known as cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV) -- was first found in the UK in 2012 and has mostly been reported by pet owners who walk their dogs in the countryside. The disease has a mortality rate of 90%. Most cases are reported during winter and spring, when the weather is typically colder and wetter.

According to Vets4Pets, Alabama rot is "a doggy disease of unknown cause affecting all breeds and doesn't discriminate in terms of age or weight." It is believed the disease can be picked up on dogs' paws and legs on muddy walks -- so owners are urged to wash mud off their dogs. The Vets4Pets website adds: "Unfortunately, if not spotted early, it can lead to sudden and potentially fatal kidney failure."

The signs of Alabama rot include skin lesions, sore skin, and outward signs of kidney failure (including vomiting, reduced hunger, and unusual tiredness). There is no known way of preventing dogs from contracting Alabama rot and there "have been cases of closely associated dogs becoming affected."

How many cases have there been in Somerset? There have been 10 confirmed cases of Alabama rot in Somerset, according to a Vets4Pets map (https://www.vets4pets.com/pet-health-advice/alabama-rot/). Dogs from Bridgwater, Brushford, Crowcrombe, Frome, Martock, Taunton, and West Coker have been affected by the disease. If "areas walked" is not listed, it means the category is marked as "unknown" on the map.

[The following information on Alabama rot has been excerpted from https://felcana.com/blogs/blog/alabama-rot:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"What is Alabama rot? Despite much research, the cause of Alabama rot remains a bit of a mystery. However, we now know a little bit more about how the disease process works.

"The actual name of what we call the 'Alabama rot' in the UK is cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV). The name 'Alabama rot' comes from a similar disease discovered in greyhounds in Alabama in the United States in the 1980s. Unfortunately, CRGV in the UK does not discriminate on breeds of dog, age or weight.

"CRGV is also known under the name of the New Forest disease, as some of the 1st cases reported in the UK were discovered in New Forest, Hampshire. However, the disease is now recognised in 43 counties across the country.

"Where is Alabama rot found in the UK? In general, we have found that southern UK regions have seen a higher than average proportion of cases. We have taken data (dated March 2018 to February 2021) reporting the total number of Alabama rot cases per UK region and divided them by the respective total dog populations in each region.

"The South West region has the highest proportion of Alabama rot cases, with 3.85 dogs affected per every 100 000 dogs. Alabama rot is 36% more common in the South West as compared to the South East region (2.85 cases per 100 000 dogs).

"From 2018 to 2020, the most affected county was Devon (South West) with 10 total confirmed cases. This is closely followed by Greater Manchester (North West) with 8 cases. *Update February 2022: 2 new cases of Alabama Rot were reported in Surrey and Berkshire.

"What is causing Alabama rot? Alabama rot is a serious condition. Although we do not know what initially causes the disease, we now know what it leads to. CRGV causes tiny blood clots to form in the bloodstream, which then lodge in the small blood vessels supplying the skin and the kidneys. With no blood supply, those tissues start to die. This is what leads to the painful red sores visible on the dog's skin.

"The lack of blood also affects the kidneys often within 3 to 4 days, leading to quick and severe injury, which then progresses to renal failure. At that stage, the disease has reached a grave turn and unfortunately the prognosis is very poor, with a mortality rate of 80%.

"The disease seems to be more present at certain times of the year: More cases have been confirmed in winter and spring months, between November and May. Another interesting fact is that the disease seems to be related to wet, muddy and woodland areas.

"Can Alabama rot affect cats? The disease is currently only recognised in dogs. Alabama rot has not been recorded in other animal species such as cats, or rabbits.

"What are the signs of Alabama rot? CRGV or 'Alabama rot' often presents as skin sores and lesions, often on the lower legs (below elbows and knees) and occasionally on the belly, muzzle, lips and inside the mouth.

"These lesions can be early signs of Alabama rot. They can appear as swollen red patch(es) without physical injury, and often can become itchy and painful. Therefore, your dog might be excessively licking at it, causing further damage by popping the lesion and giving it a very red and raw ulcer-like appearance.

"In cases of Alabama rot, signs of kidney failure often start to appear 3 to 4 days following the sores. However, in some cases dogs can develop kidney failure without having any previous lesions. The signs to look for are decreased or loss of appetite, vomiting, increased drinking, fatigue and depression.

"What to do if you are worried about your dog? Itchy skin lesions on your dog are not always a result of Alabama rot.... However, if you remain unsure about a suspicious looking lesion, especially if you dog is looking unwell, it is always recommended to visit your vet to rule out Alabama rot.

"Your vet will be able to advise you on the best course of action and may recommend blood and urine sampling to test for any other potential signs, such as thrombocytopenia (platelet deficiency in the blood, leading to bleeding in tissues, bruising and slower clotting after an injury) and anaemia (low red blood cell or haemoglobin concentration in the blood). As the disease progress very quickly, prompt action is crucial for a better outcome.

"Is Alabama rot contagious? There is currently no evidence of Alabama rot infecting humans through dogs. Although there have been cases where 2 dogs from one household show similar signs, it is not believed to be a disease which can be transmitted from dog to dog. Instead, it seems to be an environmental trigger, not yet identified, that dogs are exposed to during walks.

"Multiple dog owners with an affected dog should therefore keep a close eye on their other dogs, by regularly checking the most affected areas (below elbow and knee, muzzle, lips and tongue).

"How can I prevent my dogs from getting Alabama rot? Due to the unknown cause of the disease, there are currently no proven preventions to avoid contracting the disease.

"However, the disease seems to be more prevalent in certain regions, such as Greater Manchester, Dorset, Devon and New Forest in Hampshire. It is therefore important to be vigilant in those 'hotspots', and if possible, avoiding walks in muddy and woodland areas. You can find cases by postcode at https://www.vets4pets.com/pet-health-advice/alabama-rot/.

"Rinsing your dog's legs after a wet and muddy walk can be a sensible thing to do. However, there is no scientific proof saying it prevents or slows down the disease process.

"Since November 2012, there were 241 cases across 42 counties in the UK. The number of cases and the affected regions seem have increased since the 1st case in 2012. However, this could be due to an increased awareness of the disease and better identification and tracking methods.

"Although the CRGV Alabama rot is an emerging disease which is becoming widely recognised, it remains a rare condition. With 10.1 million dogs in the UK in 2020, there is approximately 0.0004% chance of your dog being one of them, which is roughly 1 in 270 270 dogs.

"It is important to not worry too much. What truly matters is awareness and vigilance. In doubt, it is always safer to not ignore the signs and to immediately contact your vet. The sooner the disease is identified, the sooner the treatment can be started -- giving your dog a better chance of survival.

"What treatment options are available for Alabama rot? It is currently difficult to treat this disease, as the cause remains unknown. Often the treatment is supportive, such as fluids and transfusions when possible, but unfortunately it is only successful in 20% of cases.

"However, the Royal Veterinary College in London has started a treatment called plasmapheresis, which involves filtration of blood from proteins and toxins, before returning it back to the dog's body. A plasma transfusion is then made to increase the chances and rate of recovery. This treatment has been fully successful on 2 dogs out of 6 that were treated, allowing them to make a full recovery from CRGV Alabama rot.

"Although this treatment requires full expertise and constant monitoring of the patient, it is a new hope for dogs diagnosed with this very fatal disease. But again, it is important to remember how rare Alabama rot is and that vigilance and monitoring is crucial."

But why is a condition of dogs in the UK called Alabama rot, when Alabama is in the USA? Well, a little looking around produced some minor insight: "In the mid-1980s, a troubling and mysterious disease struck racing greyhounds at tracks in Alabama. It was officially known as cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy (CRGV), but nicknamed Alabama rot. Although Alabama rot in dogs is no longer a big concern in the United States, in recent years the disease has emerged in the United Kingdom. Interestingly, it has not been connected to greyhounds the way it was in the United States -- it can affect any breed of dog" (https://www.dogster.com/dog-health-care/alabama-rot-in-dogs). - Mod.TG
