Mac, the Asian elephant calf born at the Houston Zoo 2 years ago, began
treatment on Sunday [9 Nov 2008] for elephant herpesvirus, an often fatal
virus that can affect elephants in the wild and in zoos.

"Houston Zoo elephant keepers alerted our veterinarians this morning [9 Nov
2008] when they saw early indications that Mac was exhibiting symptoms of
lethargy and diminished appetite," said Houston Zoo spokesman Brian Hill.
The veterinarians immediately began administering famciclovir, an antiviral
medication that has shown some limited success in past elephant herpes cases.

"Mac is receiving round-the-clock care from our vets and keepers that he
knows and trusts. His mother, Shanti, and his aunt, Methai, are near by,"
said Hill. "Our veterinary medical staff are also consulting with national
experts recognized in the field of the elephant herpes virus."

The history of the herpes virus in the North American Asian elephant
population has been studied since 1999, when researchers at Johns Hopkins
School of Medicine in Baltimore and at the National Zoo in Washington
identified the virus.

Many questions about the disease remain to be answered. Working with
funding from the Houston Zoo, the National Institutes of Health, the
National Zoo, and other institutions, researchers are studying the DNA of
the virus in an effort to develop an antibody profile. The results could
help determine how to treat the disease.

[We wish Mac and his vets and caretakers godspeed and successful healing.
This seems to be a difficult situation for elephants, and it seems the
virus has appeared after almost a year's absence. - Mod.TG]
