A father suffered _E. coli_ infection on a Thomas Cook family holiday at a 5-star Turkish hotel where hundreds of British tourists fell ill.

Guests at the all-inclusive Sentido Perissia Hotel in Side have been confined to their rooms because of a mass outbreak of sickness. The father, who was on holiday with his wife and 2 two children, had tests after returning to Britain which revealed he had contracted the _E. coli_ infection.

Thomas Cook said there has been an outbreak of norovirus at the hotel and that the food and hygiene standards are not to blame. The holiday company has suspended holidays at the resort after guests fell ill. It is also claimed that another guest had been infected by Giardia, a parasite that has been found in the water.

[ProMED reported the norovirus outbreak at this location. See: Gastroenteritis - Turkey: (AL) hotel guests. Archive Number: 20130822.1895920

Side (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side) is a city on the southern Mediterranean coast of Turkey, a resort town and one of the best-known classical sites in the country. It lies near Manavgat and the village of Selimiye, 75 km from Antalya in the province of Antalya.

Norvovirus outbreaks do not have to be food or waterborne and can easily spread from person to person. That being said, the epidemiology of this outbreak can assist in the determination based on the time course of the case numbers. However, with a case of _E. coli_ and one of giardiasis, it can be suggested that fecal contamination may have occurred. - Mod.LL
