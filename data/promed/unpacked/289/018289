Worst of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease outbreak may be over
---------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON: Britain may have seen the worst of its epidemic of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as vCJD or CJD (new
var.), according to a French study that says the number of cases may not
rise much above 200, far less than previous estimates. In Britain, 111
people have been diagnosed with vCJD, a fatal brain malady. Some
researchers have said that up to 136 000 people may develop the disease
over the coming decades.
But a new computer model suggests that more than half the total cases have
already occurred and the peak of the epidemic has passed. The French
researchers, in a study appearing on Fri 23 Nov 2001 in the journal
Science, state that: "The peak of the epidemic will be in 2000-2001 and
that the annual number of cases should gradually decrease after this date".
vCJD is thought to be caused by eating meat from cattle infected with
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). About a million cattle in Britain
are thought to have been infected with BSE, which [according to one
interpretation they [are presumed to have caught from feed made from the
carcasses of sheep infected with scrapie, an ovine form of the disease.
Britain's epidemic of mad cow led to a ban on beef exports to many European
countries, the destruction of herds of cattle and a decline in tourism in
the British countryside. Experts believe that BSE may have slipped into the
British beef supply as early as 1980 and hundreds of thousands of people
could have been exposed to the infected meat before November 1989, when the
use of carcasses for cattle feed was banned.
But the French researchers, led by Dr Alain-Jacques Valleron, now estimate
that the vCJD epidemic may not be nearly as extensive as earlier studies
had suggested. Valleron, a scientist at the French National Institute of
Health and Medical Research (INSERM), said the new analysis is based on a
better understanding of the incubation period for vCJD and on evidence that
young people are more susceptible to the disease. Using these factors, he
said, a computer model suggests that the total number of vCJD cases will
most likely be about 205, with an upper limit estimated at 403. The earlier
estimates by researchers in 1997 and 1999, said Valleron, were based on
fewer proven cases of the disease and included a higher degree of
uncertainty about the incubation period of vCJD. "Now we have enough cases
to make a better estimate of the incubation period," he said. Valleron also
noted that most of the victims of vCJD in Britain are young, with an
average age at death of 28. Only 6 patients were older than 50. From this,
the researchers based their prediction on the assumption that the
probability of a person becoming infected decreases with age.
In a commentary in Science, Dr Graham Medley of the University of Warwick
in Britain said many uncertainties remain in predicting the course of the
vCJD epidemic in Britain and that using the age of victims as a key
assumption in the French model "can only be unsupported speculation".
Medley said that because researchers must make assumptions in their
computer models, predictions will continue to be plagued by uncertainty.
Still, Medley said it was encouraging that each new prediction seems to
reduce the estimated number of cases.
vCJD has not been identified in the United States, but the sporadic form of
CJD, which is not linked to BSE, strikes about one person out every 1
million a year. The sporadic form mostly affects people aged 50 to 75.

[This is another prediction based on computer modelling and assumptions of
uncertain validity. Dr Graham Medley's comments in the penultimate
paragraph are apposite. - Mod.CP
