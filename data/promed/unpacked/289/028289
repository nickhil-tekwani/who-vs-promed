Local mosquito control officials announced on 2 Sep [2021] that invading mosquitoes were found in Elk Grove and Orangevale [Sacramento county].

This is the first time that _Aedes aegypti_ has been detected in these communities, the Sacramento-Yoro mosquitoes and vector control districts have reported. Such mosquitoes are known to actively bite humans throughout the day. Mosquito control authorities warn residents to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in the garden.

"We are heading towards the most active times of these mosquitoes and we need your help to control them," district manager Gary Goodman said at a press conference.

District staff warned that new invasive species could carry potentially deadly illnesses [viruses] such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika.

In the United States, the majority of cases of these diseases last year [2020] were detected in people traveling abroad, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC reported last year [2020] that 4 travelers tested positive for Zika. Dengue fever, which is commonly found in the Caribbean Sea, was reported to have been detected in 332 cases in the United States in 2020. CDC staff also reported that there were 29 cases of chikungunya fever in the United States that year [2020].

Luz Robles, a spokesman for the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District, said infected travelers are still at risk of returning from abroad and being bitten by mosquitoes.

"The real threat is that when I get sick and return to my home in Elk Grove, if I get bitten by a mosquito, the mosquito can become infected locally," she said.

According to Robles, _Aedes aegypti_was first discovered in Southern California 10 years ago, and since then _Aedes aegypti_ has been slowly moving northward in the state.

She said her agency staff recently discovered the species in Elk Grove after setting up a mosquito trap in a residential area near Smedberg Park. They set up traps after employees visited friends in the neighborhood and noticed that they were frequently bitten by mosquitoes.

This species usually lays eggs inside water containers such as indoor flower pots, buckets, bird baths, children's toys, and even bottle caps. Their eggs can also withstand dry conditions for months, Robles said.

Her staff asks the residents not only to drain the water containers of their property, but also to rub them to make sure there are no remaining eggs. It is advisable to wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers outdoors as these mosquitoes tend to bite the ankles, elbows, and wrists.

[_Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes continue to increase their geographic range in California this year (2021). Now Sacramento County is included again with 4 other recent new locations: Butte, Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Yolo counties. Shasta and San Joaquin counties were added earlier in 2020. The open question is if these mosquitoes have been established in these localities or if they have been eradicated there. Breeding sites can be difficult to find. There is no indication in the above report of how these mosquitoes arrived in Elk Grove and Orangevale.

Although the report above points out that _A. aegypti_ is capable of transmitting any of the mentioned viruses, ongoing transmission is unlikely; however, it is not zero, so elimination of this mosquito as quickly as possible in the localities where it has recently been found is prudent. Once well established, this mosquito is difficult to eradicate. Control requires considerable continuous effort. - Mod.TY
