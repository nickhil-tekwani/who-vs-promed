Parasite of sleeping sickness in the blood of a patient near Kolkata
-----------------------------------------------
Trypanosoma parasite[s] were recently found in the blood of a patient in
Canning subdivision of West Bengal in the district of South 24 Parganas
near Kolkata. The presence of the parasite was confirmed by the
protozoology experts of the School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata. The
patient died in a private nursing home. Epidemiologists could not establish
the source of this infection nor the vector of the disease, as the Tsetse
fly, the vector of sleeping sickness, is absent in India. 2 years ago, a
similar parasite was also found in the blood of a person near Mumbai,
India, which is situated about 2000 km away from Kolkata. Health
Authorities are closely monitoring the situation, and they have arranged
everything for proper management of such cases in case of an outbreak of
such a disease.

[In ProMED's previous posting on the subject of trypanosomiasis in India,
16 Dec 2004 (see ref. below), it was stated that the Maharashtra government
collaborated with the WHO on the case and that samples for confirmatory
testing had been sent to a WHO reference center with expertise in
trypanosomiasis. We still lack these results. The discussion in that
posting related to a case in Maharashtra. the above posting discusses a
case hospitalized in Kolkata (West Bengal), seemingly a different case than
discussed in the prior posting of 16 Dec 2004. In addition, the present
message contains no details on the background details surrounding this
case, leading to the suspicion of trypanosomiasis as the diagnosis. If
based on microscopy alone, there are numerous pitfalls, and specific DNA or
antibodies should be demonstrated. If photographs are available, these
could be posted on the university's website for comments. Based on the
present data, ProMED still questions the conclusion that a diagnosis of
trypanosomiasis has been confirmed - Mods.EP/MPP]
